One interesting development this week has been the much lower than expected European inflation rates which in most 
cases are taking the YoY growth back down to levels only previous seen in the modern era (for a few months) in 2009. 
Spanish CPI was 0.3-0.4% lower than expected on Wednesday with the straight CPI number in technical deflation at - 
0.1% YoY. German numbers came in around 0.2% below expectatio=s on the same day (1.2% YoY) with Italy yesterday 
seeing 0.7% YoY inflation against 1.1-1.2% expected. The overall Eurozone number showed similar decli=es. It's difficult 
to know what to think about this though. It has certai=ly helped the Euro come off its recent peak (1.382 earlier this 
week to 1.355 as we type) as the market considers the possibility of ECB rate cuts again. Higher than expected Euro 
unemployment (12.2% vs 12.0% expected) helped on this front too. Simultaneously it seems the Fed isn't going to 
guarantee us no taper before March even if that eventually materialises. So the liqui=ity perception balance between 
the two regions has shifted a bit over the last 48 hours. But back to Euro inflation, our experts think there are some one-
offs in the numbers and expect the rate to tick up over the coming months. One can also argue that low inflation in the 
likes of Spain is a sign of improving competitiveness. Nevertheless there are worries and it certainly ties in with the 
arguments made in our long-term study from September "A Nominal Problem" where we highlighted how we were 
having a global problem with both low real GDP and inflation. The combinati=n not being great when you still have a 
high debt burden. Europe really doesn=t need the threat of deflation with so many structural issues still to deal with. 
Although inflation is expected to edge back up from here we are getti=g to low enough levels that the behaviour of 
participants in the economy might start to be influenced by the prospect of falling prices and they may hold back 
purchases/investments. This is why central banks generally aim for at least 2% on inflation and not zero. You tend to 
want to make it positive enough that deflation doesn't ever become an imminent risk. So this is one to watch going into 
2014. In the nearer-term keep an eye out for the survey of professional forecasters release in the middle of this month. 
The ECB is very sensitive to the 2-yr ahead reading as a measure of inflation expectations and it may influence their 
policy stance to some degree at the December meeting and into 2014. 
On a more positive note, the latest activi=y data from China continues to improve. The official manufacturing PMI rose 
to 51.4 in October from 51.1 in September. It managed to beat expectations of 51.2 and was also the highest reading in 
18 months. DB's Jun Ma hi=hlights that October's PMIs are historically lower than those for September, =o the MOM 
uptick is therefore a bit more impressive. The uptrend in October was also confirmed by the final HSBC manufacturing 
PMI which printed at 50.9 which is higher than the preliminary reading of 50.7 and SeptemberR=7;s reading of 50.9. 
The Chinese data has helped put a floor on Asian equities overnight and S&P S00 futures are nudging higher (+0.15%=. 
The key laggard are Japanese equities where the TOPIX (-X%) is weaker press=red by a number of industrials, ahead of a 
three day weekend. Electronics-maker Sony is down 13% after surprising the market with a profit downgrade with this 
impacting sentiment in Japanese equities. While EURUSD continues to be pressured this morning, the sentiment is 
firmer in AUDUSD (+0.2%) driven by the Chinese PMIs. 
In the US, a surprisingly strong Chicago P=l print set the tone early in the day. The PMI surged 10.2 points to 65.9 which 
was almost lipoints above consensus estimates. Our economists point out that this was the largest monthly increase 
since July 1983 (+12.7) and the highest level since March 2011 (67.6). Initial jobless claims of 340k were broadly in line 
with estimates of 338k. The S&P 500 traded down to a session low of 1755 shortly after the Chicago PMI release which 
triggered further chatter of December tapering, but the dip proved to be brief and equities quickly recovered from those 
levels. Towards the end of US trading, equities once again gave up those gains to finish near the month on a sour note 
(S&P500 -0.38% on the day). Financials weighed on the index for much of the day and closed at the lows. A Bloomberg 
report suggesting that AT&T would make a tilt at Vodafone next year, saw telcos also weigh on equity markets in the 
final minutes of trading. If the acquis=tion were to go ahead, it would create the world's largest telecom company with a 
market cap exceeding $250bn with more than 500 million subscribers worldwide (Bloomberg). Elsewhere, after the 
initial post-Chicago PMI sellof=, 10yr UST yields drifted back down to be a little higher (2.554%, +1.6bp) on the day —
bucking the trend in Europe where core and periphery bond yields fell on the back of the lower inflation numbers. 
Looking at the day ahead, today's IS= will be a major focus particularly following the bumper Chicago PMI yesterday. In 
light of this, DB's Joe Lavorgna has raised his forecast for the I=M by 1.5 points to 57.5. The first of the post-FOMC 
Fedspeak begins today with Bullard speaking on monetary policy in St Louis. In the UK, the manufa=turing PMI is the 
only data of note. RBS is due to report its FY13 results and the expectation is that Chancellor Osborne may speak shortly
