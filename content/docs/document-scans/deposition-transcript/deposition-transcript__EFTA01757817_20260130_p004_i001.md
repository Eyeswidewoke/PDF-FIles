<br><font face="sans-serif">Hi 
</font> <br><font face="sans-serif">I'm in China until Friday and then I go to 
India until this Monday so I can only get emails but not texts, until then. </font> <br><font face="sans-serif'>Hey, on my 
14 hour flight to Beijing, I thought that I'd "take a page out of your book", thinking that some of your discipline rubbed 
off on me, and skip some of the meals but I only skipped one. I've decided I need a 24 hour &quot 
hotline&quot; to talk me through these life hurdles.</font> <br>cfont face="sans-serifa, I have also thought of 
the following. I watch a lot of movies and the tall, beautiful, brainy, Russian woman is usually a secret agent who must 
kill the man. The fact that your parents were in the intelligence services does nothing to mitigate this concern. I will ask 
that you don't kill me, but if you must, then I want a kiss before you do it, just like in all of the movies that I watch. 
</fon=> <br><font face="sans-serif">OK, everything above was only a joke. 
Let's see if I have anything serious to say. OK: how are things? How is your exercise routine? Will you travel 
soon?</font> <br><font face="sans-serif">Below is the revised version of the song I wrote for class, that I said I would 
send. </font> <br> <br><font face="sans-serif'>Assignment: Song #1, "I Remember America"=/font> <br><font

us.</font> <br><font face="sans-serif">But now we&#39;re getting socialist like the Soviets.</font> <br><font
