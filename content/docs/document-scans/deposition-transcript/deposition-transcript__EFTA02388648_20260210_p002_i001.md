» Also unrelated but fun, I think I found a bug in the IRS tax code, in the sense that I think you can give 
out to employees —lbitcoin without any taxation on it. That's because bitcoin is "property" according to the IRS and you 
can give to employees 'awards' that are "tangible personal property" up to $400 w/o incurring taxation.

» Phase 1 
» The IRS has something called "Cafeteria plans" which is essentially a type of perk that is not taxed and 
people can use their allowance to pay for various kind of medical things (and a few other minor things). 
» Now I talked to Sandy and his partner that does the taxes part at the firm and it seems like a lot of 
companies give out 'fake dollars' to employees that represent the amount of money they can spend with their "Cafeteria 
plan". 
» On top of that the IRS also defines a type of non-taxed perk called "No-additional-cost services", 
essentially a company can give to its employees perks that the company usually sell to customers if giving the perks 
doesn't cause additional cost 
» to the company. An example is an empty seat on a plane right for an airline. 
» Ok so here's the plan: we replace the 'fake dollars' with a digital currency. The digital currency among 
other things has the clear advantage that it's easier to manage compare to 'fake dollars' plus I think it has benefits from 
a psychological POV in terms of people "owning" something, anyway.. 
» On top of the digital currency we allow people to use an 'exchange' where they can barter things in 
exchange for this digital currency. Eventually once we get enough people with some handwaiving we can allow people 
from different companies to 
» exchange the currency and use "no-additional-cost services" from other currency. Eg: Say that 
Amazon can give to employees free computing power on AWS as a non-taxable perk (whether it's de-minimis or "No-
additional-cost"). A guy from Google got coins from a guy from amazon and he can 'buy' AWS time. 
» We can also have (maybe) cash prices for random coins that are drawn at the end of a year or 
something. This way people will be more encouraged to trade their stuff for the digital currency. 
» important: Note that even if the tax benefits are not fully realized, companies might still be willing to 
do that. First because they can 'track' employees spending (to a certain extent), second because they don't immediately 
give away real money to employees and third because it's a more efficient system. 
>> 
» Phase 2 
» Hopefully at this point we have enough companies enrolled and the IRS might look into this, so at this 
stage we go to the Treasury/IRS/Fed and tell them "Look all these companies are already using this currency to pay 
some of benefits of their employees, how about you make this approved and also allow companies to pay for services 
among themselves in this currency?". The benefit for the govt would be identical to the one mentioned in the 
"spaghetti" idea (traceability etc etc). 
>> 
» Assuming we get the US gov on board we can later go to other companies&govts and propose they 
allow the currency as well. If they do the end result is that companies can trade across borders without having to worry 
about FX risks and stuff. 
» Also in the proposal we ask the govt to give a tax break on the transactions company-to-company 
made in the new currency. 
» If none of this works & the IRS doesn't shut the stuff in Phase 1 down, we still have a business. If this 
works and Phase 2 is fully completed, then we have a great business.
