Palestinian-Israeli Relations= The issue of housing settlements continues to stir political tensions. Is=aeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu ordered 300 new homes to be built i= the Beit El settlement in the West Bank on June 6. The 
United Nations, th= United States, and European Union representatives criticized the decision= questioned its 
legitimacy, and decried it as undermining peace efforts. 
<ro:p> 
Syria:=Violence increased substantially in recent weeks with the reported kil=ing of hundreds of innocent men, women, 
and children in Houla, Qubair, andrAl Heffa by forces tied to the Assad government. The Free Syrian Army is n=ticeably 
better equipped, using antitank rockets to inflict heavier casual=ies among Syrian security forces. Following attacks on 
its mission observe=s, the United Nations suspended the mission, although the monitors remain =n Syria on lock down 
and unable to conduct patrols. The situation is forci=g the international community to reconsider its options for 
implementing t=e action plan. Bashar al-Assad, under heavy international pressure to comp=y with the peace plan, 
appeared unfazed as he gave a speech to the Parliam=nt on June 3 denying any government responsibility for the killing 
of civi=ians and describing the situation as an externally-driven crisis. Diplomat= are reportedly considering forming an 
international contact group as call=d for by Arab League-UN mediator Kofi Annan on June 7. The venue, tiring, and 
participants are currently under discussion. 
Trends in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Tuni=ia, and Yemen: 
• 
On June 10, opposition groups i= Iraq lacked the necessary 163 votes to pass a no confidence motion=to oust 
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki after 11 Members of Parliament (MPs)=retracted their signatures. Press reports indicated 
that the Iranian gover=ment had influenced the process, exerting pressure on certain Iraqi MPs. S=nni-Shia tensions 
were also reflected in ongoing violence, including a dea=ly suicide attack on a Shiia religious office on June 4.=/Ii> 
• 
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prin=e and Interior Minister Nayef bin Abdulaziz al-Saud died in Geneva on June=16. As 
expected, Defense Minister Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud was =amed Deputy Prime Minister and the new heir 
apparent by royal decree. = 
• 
In Tunisi=, the new government, led by the Ennanda Party, is being challenged by=the entrenched interests of 
the former Ben Ali government and by Salafist =ctivists. Judges went on strike after the Justice Minister fired 81 
judges=on suspicion of corruption. Clashes between the police and Salafist protes=ors have escalated to pre-revolution 
levels, sparked by an altercation bet=een the police and Salafists in Jencouba following the arrest of four Sala=is. As a 
result, the government imposed a curfew in major cities inc=uding Tunis. 
• 
In Yemen, the army =uccessfully ousted the Ansar Sharia fighters (an Al Qaeda affiliated group= from the cities 
of Zinjibar and Ja'ar in the Abyan province that ha= been under Al Qaeda control si=ce May 2011. The army is now 
pursuing al-Qaeda terrorists in other =arts of the province. The Security Council is considering sanctions agains= groups 
associated with the former regime that continue to undermine the t=ansition. Deposed President Ali Abdullah Saleh's 
close relatives sti=l hold key positions in the military which is making the democratic transi=ion more difficult.
