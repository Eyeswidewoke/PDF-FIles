Re: Hi! 
I'm not going to forget about anything either. I had a w=nderful time with you and I'm glad that you are my friend. You 
are a v=ry special girl and I hope you have the chance to come back next Summer. l=don't ever want you to think that 
spending time with you meant nothing=to me. I think so much of you and how sweet, kind and special you are. It =as not 
easy for me to write what I did but I knew it was necessary. I miss=you too and what is so funny is that we didn't really 
know each other =hat long or that well. It was a special time and I look forward to the tho=ght that we might be able to 
meet again next Summer. Until then, I look fo=ward to more emails and maybe even a Skype. But it is important to say 
tha= we have to be just friends, okay. 
Talk to you soon, 
Jeremy

Hi Jeremy! 
I k=ow our situation now probably seems ridiculous, but you are so wrong if yo= think I'll forget about 
everything. Yes, we know each other for a short time, but you will always be a man to me, not just a friend, and I know 
=hatever happens I will keep those time in my memory, cause I feel like it =as something very special to me. You may say 
I'm a child still, but I =now what I say. Of caurse, I will have fun being here as well as you will =njoy your time, won't you? 
And it's ok. I'm gonna come to NY i= Jul or Aug and to stay, it probably would be the last chance to do it, ca=se if I 
graduate my university I'd hardly be able to come to US, that&=39;s why I wanna try it this summer. I don't gonna ask 
you to wait for=me, but Jeremy, I just wanna know, if all this means nothing to you - plea=e, tell me. 
I miss you, Jeremy 
P.S. a prayer for me...it's so pathetically!)

Hi =, 
Also, I want to write to you about you and me and where I'd like fo= our friendship to go. When we met 
it was great and I have had such a wond=rful time getting to know you. But being that we are so far apart and have=such 
a difference in age I know that things will eventually change. You st=Il have a lot of experience to go through and I want 
to encourage you to g= out and have a lot of fun. We will always be friends and I hope we can co=tinue talking but I 
want you to enjoy University life and all (not that yo= aren't already!) :) I look forward to hearing from you again an=, 
again, I'm so glad we met and I'm really glad you are my friend.=br> 
Talk to you soon, 
Jeremy
