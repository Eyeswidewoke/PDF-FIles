I understand and I t=ank you for your consideration. 
The 800 will go to cover net working capital coming from growth and to get =ne final 
director for the print division. Of the other 3 directors one is =erforming really well and the other 2 I just brought them 
over to these po=itions in July. If just one of them makes it we will be at 600k profit. Ab=ut 150-200k need to go to Paris 
to bring in a strong team and finance net =orking capital. 
As per the forecast vs actual you see very clearly the deter=oration coming in the 
summer of 2014. Giancarlo started spending 2 days in=the agency, fired the director and then dealt with the problems 
of h=s mother. I am confident that I will put it again on the right track. Not =asy but we will become as strong as fashion.

I think your consideration is accurate. 
On top of it you should factor in

If we use market valuation that's quite an asset
