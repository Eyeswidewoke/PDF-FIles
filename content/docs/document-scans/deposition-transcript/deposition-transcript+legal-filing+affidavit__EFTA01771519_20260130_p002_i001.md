=div>It =s what Merkel has said she fears most. When you visit Germany, everyone =ill tell you three 
things when it comes to the European crisis. =nbsp;First, Germany owes an enormous debt to Europe. Second, =outhern 
Europe must control their budgets. And third, and dont =iss this one, Germany can never let the European Central Bank 
print =oney. For every German believes that part of what led to the =irst issue, was the hyper inflation of the 1930's 
created by German's =rinting money. German's are terrified of inflation. And =nflation starts with printing money. 
r/span> 
Its a point I have some sympathy for, as I lived in the hyper =nflation world of Brazil in the 1980's. It is 
no wonder that two =onsecutive, leftist Presidents in Brazil, starting with the labor =eader known the world over, as 
Lula, ran a governement who's fiscal and =onetary policy would make the farthest right leaning, German.... proud. 
=nbsp;For Lula witnessed the reality of inflation in his early =ears. Inflation is a brutul tax on the poor. Throw human 
=ympathies out the door, inflation is a government tax to pay down debt, =here the burden is carried almot totally by 
the least able to afford =t. Run-away inflation is a crushing and relentless charge on a =ocieties poorest. And it is 
caused, primarily, because =overnments print money to avoid difficult choices. 
=div> 
=div>Paul Krugman's =conomics contemplate extraordinary deftness by high officials pushing =he right 
economic buttons. Right now, our Fed has bought over $2 =rillion dollars of US debt to fund almost every penny of 
deficit =pending of the last two years (where did they get that money from?). =nbsp;And now the Europeans are doing 
something similiar. Central =anks are not supposed to lend without strong, bullet proof collatoral; =ts called secured 
lending. 
Remember how the market tricked =tself with triple AAA securites. So how secure is a three year =oan 
collatoralized by a one year piece of paper. What would you =ay if a bank gave you a three year loan, and said that you 
only had to =how proof that you could pay your loan back in the first =ear. 
Last week the ECB held its first auction for this type of =ransaction. Over 500 banks in Europe borrowed 
over $600 billion =n one day. And I would wager, unchecked, this will grow by =nother $1 trillion early next year when 
they do it again. 
=div> 
=div>What both the Fed and =he ECB are doing, is dramatically growing their balance sheets by =utting 
money into the public markets. What all economists know is =hat at some point, they will have to take this money back. 
=div> 
=div>if the heads of our =entral Banks are indeed the true "Masters of the Universe", they will =how a 
level of self control and card counting, like the very best card =harks of all time. And Paul Krugman will have helped save 
the =orld's economy. 
But it is a huge gamble, and one can only hope, that the =orlds economists haven't forgotten the early 
lesson of economics: There =s no free lunch."
