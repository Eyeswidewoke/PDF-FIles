current machines). The molder is highly novel and patented. Prototypes have been 
built and used to make a small number of lenses that met or exceeded commercial 
standards of spectacle lens quality. A SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) 
Phase I grant was awarded to Squid Labs to advance this technology to make 
progressive advanced lenses (multi-focal lenses for smooth transition from far to near 
vision in patients with presbyopia); one result from that effort is a determination that 
advancing the technology in that direction is riskier and more capital-intensive than 
productizing the molder to make single-vision lenses (conventional sphero-cylindrical 
lenses to correct for near- and far-sightedness and astigmatism). 
It is important to emphasize that spectacle lenses are already inexpensive to produce 
in factories and in many places inexpensive to distribute from factories to retail 
outlets. The availability in American retail pharmacy chains of reading glasses for 
less than $10 demonstrates that plastic lens manufacture is already quite efficient: 
making spectacle lens blanks (to be cut to fit a particular frame shape) in a factory 
costs only pennies per lens. OptiOpia's prototype lens molder is particularly helpful 
where rapid service is valuable to the customer or provider, where portability is 
valuable, and where the costs in space, working capital, training or administrative 
overhead of managing many drawers full of lenses -- and the supply chain to deliver 
them -- are burdensome. The lens molder is simpler in several dimensions as well as 
faster. That simplicity of "pour plastic in, type prescription in, make lens in five 
minutes" is particularly well-suited for small shops, kiosks within shops and mobile 
providers, and in regions that have uncertain supply chains. For those reasons, the 
molder will find a market in many regions of many less-developed countries. 
Develooment Status. The next step is to test performance of the existing prototype 
with a large batch of sample lenses. If that is successful, work will proceed, subject to 
financing, to advance the commercial development and add proprietary technology 
for certain functionalities not disclosable here. The testing step requires $10,000 and 
some management time — essentially, a summer project with an engineering student 
and part-time technician. Financing is sought to productize the molder as well as to 
complete the productization of the auto-refractor. We estimate that approximately 
$1.75 million and 18 months will result in production of a small number of beta-
products for extensive testing, evaluation and use in marketing to lead customers and 
in driving partnerships. We believe that the initial COGS will be $2,000 and then will 
decline with experience and scale. (It'S an essentially mechanical device, likely 
susceptible to numerous incremental process and component improvements that will 
lower cost.) 
Markets for the Auto-refractor and Lens molder 
Summary. There are several markets for the auto-refractor (AR), the lens molder, 
and the bundled pair. Eyeglasses are sold profitably to the end-user (unlike condoms 
& vaccines), even by charities. We find from informal and formal market research in 
different regions that people are usually prepared to pay 1/2  - 1 week's wages for 
exam + glasses ($4 - $40) in very large 'base of the pyramid": markets.
