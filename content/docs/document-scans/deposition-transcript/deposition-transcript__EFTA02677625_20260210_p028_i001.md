In fairness, SNAP isn't the biggest anti-p=verty program on the books. That would be Social Security, also expanded by 
the war on pover=y. The Earned Income Tax Credit, which came a few decades after, and other refundable credits are 
No. 2:

The impact of non-transfer programs such as Medica=e, Medicaid and Job Corps on poverty is harder to measure, but 
what indication= there are are promising. Amy Finkelstein and Robin McKnight have found that Medicare significantly 
reduced out-of-pocket medical expenditures for senio=s, which increased their real incomes. The Oregon Medicaid 
Study found that th= program significantly reduces financial hardship for its beneficiaries, who= under Oregon's 
eligibility rules at the time, all fell below the povert= line. A randomized evaluation of the Job Corps found that it caused 
improvements =n a variety of outcomes, most notably a 12 percent increase in earnings of participants but also 
reductions in rates of incarceration, arrest, and conviction. 
Title I, on the other hand, is generally agreed to cause more equitable school funding allocations, but the evidence on its 
effects =n student achievement is less promising, with many evaluations finding no eff=ct. A randomized evaluation of 
Head Start found that its effects faded out quic=ly, and many experts, notably James Heckman, are quite skeptical of the 
program=#39;s benefits. That said, other researchers, like Harvard's David Deming, ha=e more positive evaluations. 
6. Why don't people think it reduced poverty? 
Largely because people rely on the official poverty r=te, which is a horrendously flawed measure, which excludes income 
received from major anti-poverty programs like food stamps or the EITC. It also fails to =ake into account expenses such 
as child care and out-of-pocket medical spending= If you look at the traditional rate — which, I'm not even kidding, is 
ba=ed on the affordability of food for a family of three in 1963/4, with no adjustments except for inflation since then —
it looks like poverty has stagnated rat=er than fallen. So when you read, say, the Cato Institute's Micha=l Tanner writing 
things like, "the poverty rate has remained relatively constan= since 1965, despite rising welfare spending," keep in mind 
that that statistic is completely meaningless in this context. The relevant measure i= the supplemental poverty measure 
which, as mentioned above, fell following =he start of the war on poverty.

7. What more could we be doing now to fight poverty? 
So many things! We could expand existing working =nti-poverty programs like Social Security, the Earned Income Tax 
Credit, the child tax credit and food stamps, or at least reverse recent cuts to the latter. We could, similarly, cut taxes on 
the working poor, perhaps by exempting the f=rst $10,000 or so of a worker's earnings from payroll taxes, or by cutting 
=own on the extremely high effective marginal tax rates which poor Americans face. =e could adopt a still more 
dramatic transfer regime, such as a basic income o= low-income wage subsidies. We could be investing in education, 
such as by scaling up successful pre-K pilots such as the Perry or Abecedarian experiments, or by expanding high-
performing charter schools and having traditional public schools adopt their approaches. We could raise the minim=m 
wage, which all researchers find reduces poverty.
