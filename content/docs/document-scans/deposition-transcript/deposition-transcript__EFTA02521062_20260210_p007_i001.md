appease through guilt. Hillary Clint on's "reset" with Russia conveyed the same submissi=e request for a more 
acceptable response. In being guilty we presume the o=her party will recognize our contrition and respond in like kind. 
One of t=e Control Factor's most devastating moves is employed- presuming t=e other is just like us and will respond the 
way we would. This is frequen=ly how an enabler justifies his continuous support for an addict. The prob=em, however is 
that our Islamic Enemy is NOT like us and will not respond =n like kind. Rather, as we repeatedly refuse to learn, 
appeasement invites=more abuse from an enemy. This becomes the "game of=guilt;" it tends to expand to greater and 
greater consequence=. Paradoxically, psychological defenses tend to create the very outcomes t=ey seek to eliminate 
and it is no different here. It is a game we love to =lay but, unfortunately, the game gives us no rules for how to end 
it.</=> 
All beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of=guilt, along with other 
Control Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is=winning and to continue playing. 
FP: The reason=Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precis=ly because 
of our Control Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers.=u> 
Siegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be =mazed that no one could see what he 
was about, in retrospect the same appl=es to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that c=uld allow 
this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was=blatantly voicing his Islamist views and Jihadi intent 
including, even, an=essay recommending the "painful liquidation" of non-Muslim=. Yet, in the Army of all places, the 
Control Factor operated to allow and=even foster his work. Even after the murders, we continue the denial by calling it 
"workplace violence." He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad combo! And we continue to enable =A0the same infiltration 
elsewhere. 
FP: Tell our=readers about "The Project" and "Explanatory Memor=ndum." These are realities that serve 
as great threats to the Cont=ol Factor, right? 
Siegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline th= Muslim Brotherhood's goals and plans 
underlying the Civ=lization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. =he 1991 Explanatory 
Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundati=n trial and describes the Brotherhood's work in America 
as a =E2 Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means" and="a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying 
the Western c=vilization from within and 'sabotaging' its miserable hous= by their own hands and the hands of the 
believers so that it is eliminated and God's religion is made victorious ove= all other religions." 
Much as the commun=sts of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term p=an to 
destroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of =ate including destroying the nuclear family, secularizing 
the nation,=feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategi=s to infiltrate while eroding the foundations of 
our civilization in order=to transform it into an Islamic one. The Control Factor has many inge=ious ways to convince us 
that this is ridiculous, that our courts and syst=m would never allow such a thing, that one is racist or "Isla=ophobic," if 
not insane, for even thinking this is real. =AO And just as with the communists, time is plentiful. Even more so w=th our 
Islamic Enemy, a multi-decade plan is short term. It is not cr=tical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to see the 
result. It is critical, more correctly a duty, however, that he carries on his Jihad. =A0Patrick Poole and The Center for 
Security Policy's Team B Report= Shariah: The Threat to America

FP: And so what you call an "Inner Jihad" has to =tart. It's our, as you say, mandatory "addiction 
treatment=" Please explain. 
Siegel: The "=nner Jihad" is the effort we must undertake to gain control over o=r Control Factors. There 
is a famous Hadith in which Mohammad, return=ng from a successful battle, essentially says that the physical fight was 
=he "lesser Jihad" and it is time to then attend to the =80 greater Jihad "- that internal battle against our own internal
