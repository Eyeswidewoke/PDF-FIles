even assuming such an act took place in this case — nor could there be such a crime under the 
United States Constitution.) By and large, the delineation of such conduct (that is, determining 
what conduct is wrongful), and the prosecution for such conduct, have been delegated to the 
states. Such conduct is punishable under state laws, under which the age of consent varies from 
14 to 18 with many states making sex with a 16 year old completely lawful regardless of the age 
of the other person? In short, the role of federal law in this area is carefully circumscribed. 
The legislative history of the federal "sex" statutes at issue evinces no federal concern 
with the prevalent local phenomenon of young adults — 16 or 17 years of age — voluntarily 
choosing to engage in sexual contact with anyone they desire. This is strictly a state concern, 
which some states have chosen to criminalize, while others have not, and some local prosecutors 
have chosen to prosecute, while others have not. It is not an accident that, as far as we have bee 
able to determine, ,ere ' 
o federal case involving a defendant who maintains a reasonable 
mistake of fact defense, where a de endant reasonably believed the other person was 18—years 
of age. The federal statutes were not meant to apply in those circumstances as suc con
 is a 
matter of state law. The federal statutes were intended to address those cases involving sexual 
activity with children. Indeed, the federal concerns intended to be redressed by these statutes, as 
evidenced by the legislative history; the advisory titles of the statutes; and even their sometimes 
broad language, are: the use of coercion and violence to lead children into a life of prostitution 
(12, 13, or 14 years old, or younger); sex trafficking and slavery of children; interstate or foreign 
travel to have sex with children (or engage in other illegal sexual activity); and trolling for 
children on the intemet in order to have sex with them. None of these concerns is present here.3
These constitute the paradigmatic federal concerns, mainly because the states are ill 
prepared to deal effectively with interstate and international trafficking of children. On the other 
hand, the states are fully capable of deciding how to deal with entirely local matters relating to 
men who allegedly have inappropriate sexual contact with local young women. To disregard 
these concerns, to ignore congressional purpose, and attempt to give the federal statutes their 
broadest possible interpretation would cause the undesired result of criminalizing federally 
virtually all acts of prostitution or sexual misconduct — a result not intended by Congress and 
United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995). 
2 Notably, Chapter t09A statutes, e.g., §§ 2241-2245, to which § 2423(b) inherently refers, each deal in terms of 
force and/or age. A review of these statues demonstrates that in each instance unless force is involved, the victim 
must be under 16 years old fora prosecution to lie. 
3 We understand the Office has taken the view that Mr. Epstein targeted underage high school students. This was 
absolutely not the case and we will be prepared to discuss at our meeting the objective evidence demonstrating no 
such targeting occurred.
