AT&T said in a letter =o the FCC on Dec. 2, 2010, that there was "increasing concern" in =he industry about LightSquared 
signals interfering with GPS devices. A =onth later, on Jan. 12, 2011, the National Telecommunications and =nformation 
Administration wrote that the plan to use airwaves reserved =ainly for satellite communications raised "significant 
interference =oncerns." Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn, then the Pentagon's No. 2 civilian, =rote a letter the 
same day citing "critical national security" =ssues. 
The letters didn't stop the FCC =rom granting the waiver two weeks =ater. The agency required that interference 
concerns be resolved, and a =orking group was set up to study the matter while LightSquared signed =p wholesale 
customers. 
GPS users, including Deere & Co. (DE) and Delta Air Lines Inc., =ormed a lobbying group in March to oppose 
LightSquared's plan. The =rganization, Coalition to Save Our GPS, said in a press release that =onth that Falcone's 
network posed "a serious threat" to GPS and =ecommended safeguards. 
'Can't Believe =his' 
Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, told FCC =hairman Julius Genachowski 
<http://topics.bloomberg.com/julius-genachowski/> in =pril that the SEC's investigation of Falcone should have led the 
=gency "to proceed with caution rather than step on the gas."=AT&T, based in Dallas, and Verizon in New York are 
among Grassley's=biggest donors, according to campaign-spending tracker OpenSecrets. 
In June, the Federal Aviation =dministration said outdoor and laboratory tests showed that GPS =eceivers would be 
affected by signals from LightSquared's 40,000 base =tations. Six months later, the Defense and Transportation 
departments =ssued a statement <http://www.gps.govinews/2011/12/lightsquaredk , citing an FAA analysis, that said 
=ightSquared's signals caused "interference with a flight safety =ystem designed to warn pilots of approaching terrain." 
While he doesn't have =93direct evidence" of a conspiracy to thwart him, "common sense =ill tell me that it's a 
concerted effort on behalf of certain =ompetitors," Falcone said. "Still, to this day, I'm like, I just =an't believe this." 
Michael Balmoris, an AT&T =pokesman in Washington, said in an e-mail that his company has been =93strictly neutral" 
on the matter. Bob Varettoni, a spokesman for Verizon, declined to =omment. The Coalition to Save Our GPS said in a 
March 30 FCC filing =hat LightSquared relied on the "faulty premise" it had authority to =perate a nationwide ground-
based network. "This is simply not the =ase and continued repetition will not make it so," the group =aid. 
LightSquared =91Blindsided' 
LightSquared was "blindsided," =aid Martin Harriman, an executive vice president who left the Reston, =irginia-based 
firm this year. 
"You've bought your really =ice house in Beverly Hills, and someone comes and knocks on the door =nd says, 'I'm sorry, 
but actually I'm not sure if you can =ontinue to live here,'" said Harriman, who has been named head of =usiness 
development at Telefonica SA's 02 unit. "You say, 'Why?' =hey say, 'Well, we just don't like it
in the industry =oresaw trouble. DirecTV, the largest U.S. satellite-1V provider, looked =t LightSquared's 
spectrum in 2004, according to CEO Michael White.
