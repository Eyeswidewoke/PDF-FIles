I understand=you being angry and disappointed at me, I won't try to make excuses fo= myself, I only want 
you to see things from my perspective and maybe get a=bit of what's going on. I am deeply frustrated for not being able 
to c=oose a life path and build a stable future for myself. It's part of my=personality to escape from things and blame 
outside circumstances, but dee= inside I know the problems are in my head. There is a huge range of possi=ilities ahead 
of me, and I realise I am lucky to be in a relatively good p=sition to pursue any of them, but I get dizzy, scared, confused 
and in the=end I'm somehow incapable of taking real steps into one of them. This =ear I have been working harder, I'm 
trying to manage my image more eff=ciently and I really did my best when interning for Alaia, but my men=al blockage is 
still there and I can't really see a way out of it. I k=ow you have given me directions, but I needed closer guidance and 
support.=l am not saying you owed it to me -you have done more than enough!-, or th=t your directions weren't good, 
but maybe I'm not as strong or as =mart as you are to succeed in life by myself, at least at this first stage= No one has 
the right to expect this from anyone, and as I said your monet=ry support is extraordinary. Whenever I've acted 
childishly or rebelli=us (I have trouble finding the right words) I was only hurt because I felt=you distant, cold or 
indifferent... I wanted to see you more often, talk t= you more, being able to share my dreams, my struggles and my 
fears. I end=d up driving you away when I only wanted you closer to me. I blame no one =ut myself, I should have been 
more open about my feelings and tried harder=to follow your advices, instead of rebelling against them if I didn't =eel 
you close enough. I know it now and I understand that you've lost =our patience with me. I sometimes loose hope on 
myself as well... I =nderstand it is up to me to solve my situation and stand up on my own feet= though I will rely on the 
directions you've given me with a new appro=ch. You won't be there anymore, and apart from the obvious economic 
in=onveniences, it is the certainty to have a sort of stable rock next to me =here I could rely on that I will miss more. I 
wanted to have you closer to=me, but not having you at all from now on will make me cherish what I had.=Thank you a 
thousand times for everything you've done for me. S/div>
