in the audience know there is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, 
the blob that ate Cincinnati etc. This threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of 
destroying the characters. Much of the initial exposition shows how the characters first are 
oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain it in familiar terms only to finally 
open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The next stage usually 
involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it, to 
appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings 
are due to not adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host 
of other attributes instead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision 
by whichever characters remain alive. I named this the "turnaround moment" when the character 
becomes willing to be as ruthless as the threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure 
survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for whichever characters remain to wake up fully and 
use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the threat. 
This is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own 
compulsions to deny that which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we 
will be able to wake up while we still have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight 
the battle we are in. 
I said car tier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a 
pyramid where on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. i call 
this level of maneuvers the many "D's" as they include the psychological defenses such as 
distortion, denial, demonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, 
discolorization and so forth. Layered upon these are moves such as projection, where we can 
assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish to see in them or introject traits from them into 
ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve a mixing of identities where 
we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the enemy is. Projection and introjection are 
active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to ask how what the enemy 
accuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt and Shame, our 
need to be liked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasies. 
As these narratives ("Our courts will never allow that," "As a superpower we will always be able 
to win any fight we put our minds to," "Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized" ...) 
gain consent from others they tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. 
Ultimately, what emerges is a relationship we take with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that 
between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this relationship is the "transfer of 
responsibility" in which we assume responsibility for the enemy's behavior who is addicted to 
transferring it away from itself. The Control Factor actively maintains this relationship and makes 
changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his addiction. And 
just as an addict needs to devote serious effort and con sciousness to his addiction, so must we 
devote great energy to unders tanding how the Control Factor ultimately sabotages us. 
FP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk about the three levels of jihad 
against us. What are they? 
Siegel: Simply stated, our Islamic Enemy seeks the totalitarian domination of Islam throughout 
the world — Islamic supremacy. It seeks to have the West submit to Islam. Obviously, this does
