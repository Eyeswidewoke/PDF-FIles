SPEAKER OUTPUTS 
The M600/6's speaker outputs are designed 
to accept 16 AWG - 8 AWG wire. To connect the 
speaker wires to the amplifier, first back out the 
set screws on the top of the terminal block, using 
the supplied 2.5 mm hex wrench. Strip 112 inch 
(12 mm) of insulation from the end of each wire 
and insert the bare wire into the terminal block, 
seating it firmly so that no bare wire is exposed. 
While holding the wire in place. tighten the set 
screw firmly, taking care not to strip the head of 
the screw. 
Each pair of the M600/6's channels are designed 
to deliver power into speaker loads equal to 
or greater than 2 ohms when using a "stereo" 
configuration and speaker loads equal to or greater 
than 4 ohms when using a "bridged" configuration.

BIMPORTANT 
Speaker toads below 2 ohms nominal 
per channel (or 4 ohms bridged) are 
not recommended and may cause the 
amplifier to initiate a protection mode 
which reduces power output. 
BRIDGING CONSIDERATIONS 
Bridging is the practice of combining the 
output of two amplifier channels to drive a single 
load. When bridged, each channel produces 
signals of equal magnitude. but opposite polarity. 
The combined output of the two channels 
provides twice the output voltage available from a 
single channel. The M600/6 has been designed for 
bridging of its channel pain without the need for 
input inversion adaptors. 
To bridge a pair of channels, use the "Left +" 
and "Right -" speaker connectors only (the 
"Left 
and "Right +" remain unused). When 
bridged. each channel will deliver optimum 
power into a 4 ohm load. 
M PORTANT 
When a pair of channels are bridged, they 
will deliver 200W x 1 into a 4 ohm load or 
150W x I Into an B ohm load. Operating a 
pair of bridged channels Into a load lower 
than 4 ohms is not recommended. 
Because a bridged pair of channels requires 
that both channels receive input, you need to 
connect both left and right inputs to the source 
unit. Connection of only one Input will result In 
reduced power output, increased distortion and 
can cause the amplifier to overheat. 
Do not do this! 
When a pair of the M600/6's channels are 
operating In bridged mode, the output will be in 
mono (only one channel). This mono channel 
can contain right channel only information, 
left channel only information or the sum of 
the information from both the right and left 
channels. In order to achieve one of these options, 
configure the Inputs to that pair of channels In 
one of these two ways: 
I) Left Channel Only or Right Channel Only 
Information: If you wish to send a kit-only 
or right-only signal to a pair of the M600/6's 
channels• use a "V-Adaptor" to split the single 
channel signal into both left and right RCA 
inputs. This option is useful when using a 
pair of the M600/es channels to drive left 
channel speakers only and the other pair of 
the M600/6's channels to drive right channel 
speakers only. 
2) Left + Right Channel Information: When 
bridged and fed by a stereo input, a pair of the 
h1600/6's channels will automatically combine 
the left and right channels into a summed 
mono (left + right) channel. This option is 
useful when using a pair of the M600/6's 
channels to drive a subwoofer system or a 
summed mono center channel. 
STATUS LED/ PROTECTION CIRCUITRY 
There is a single multicolor LED on the top 
surface of the amplifier to indicate the amplifier's 
operating status.

Flashing Green: amplifier is powering up. 
udio output is muted. 
2) Constant Green: amplifier is on and 
functioning normally, audio output Is active. 
) Constant Red: Indicates that the 
mplifier has exceeded its safe operating 
t mperature. putting the amplifier Into a 
self-protection mode, which reduces the 
peak power output of the amplifier. When its 
temperature returns to a safe level, the red 
light will return to green and the amplifier will 
return to full-power operating mode. 
4) Constant Amber (yellow): Indicates 
that an over-current condition has occurred 
and is accompanied by a muting of the affected 
channel(s). Because the muting behavior may be 
very short in duration, it may manifest itself as 
an audible. repetitive ticking noise in the output. 
Over-current conditions can be caused by a 
speaker impedance lower than the optimum load 
impedance range for the amplifier or a short. 
circuit in the speaker wiring. The latter can result 
from a short circuit between the positive and 
negative speaker wires or between either speaker 
wire and a power wire. The "Status LED" will 
remain amber for a few seconds, even if the 
over-current condition is of a very short duration. 
This functionality can be used to diagnose a 
short.cireuit by only connecting one channel at 
a time. The "Status LED" will turn amber when 
you connect the channel that is experiencing the 
problem and turn the volume up. 
5) LED off Amplifier Shuts Off Unexpectedly 
The only condition that will shut down 
an undamaged M600/6 completely is if battery 
voltage or remote turn-on voltage drops below 
10 volts. The 'Status LED' will turn off when 
this occurs. The amplifier will turn back on 
when voltage climbs back above 11 volts. If this 
is happening in your system. have your charging 
system and power wiring inspected. 
For more information on troubleshooting this 
amplifier, refer to Appendix D (pages 16. 17). 
SERVICING YOUR JL AUDIO AMPLIFIER 
If your amplifier falls or malfunctions. please 
return it to your authorized IL Audio dealer so 
that it may be sent in to II. Audio for service. 
There are no user serviceable parts or fuses inside 
the amplifier. The unique nature of the circuitry 
in the IL Audio amplifiers requires specifically 
trained service personnel. Do not attempt 
to service the amplifier yourself or through 
unauthorized repair facilities. This will not only 
void the warranty, but may result in the creation of 
more problems within the amplifier. 
If you have any questions about the installation or 
setup of the amplifier not covered in this manual, 
please contact your dealer or technical support.
