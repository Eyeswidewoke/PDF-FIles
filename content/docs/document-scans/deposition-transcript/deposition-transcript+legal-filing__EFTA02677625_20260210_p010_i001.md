so deeply divided in 2013 that we could not define a common enemy. We turned a blind eye to the revival of Mideast 
authoritarianism. And we fashi=ned no plans for how to respond to Syria becoming a new Afghanistan. The dam=ge 
that Washington's partisanship wrought on domestic affairs in 2013 was chronicled daily in the media. l=s destructive 
impact on the Middle East—and our national security—will emerge for years to come. And for Represent=tive Darrell 
Issa, Charles Krauthammer, Walid Phares and others where is your shame? And to President Obama, please don't bite 
the bait and stay out of Syria, because getting =n will result in America being responsible for a solution as well as the 
dama=e that this continuing conflict is causing.

Here's What GOP Obstruction Of Health Care Does To People In One Chart 
<http://i.huffpost.comigen/1549241/thumbqr-H EALTH-CARE-huge.jpg> 
While Republicans at the national level have thu= far been completely unsuccessful in attempts to repeal or defund the 
Affordable Care Act, Republicans at the state level have succeeded in preventing people fro= obtaining health coverage 
under the new law. Data compiled by Theda Skocpol of Harvard University for the Scholars Strategy Network, a 
progressive group of academics, illustrates how states&=39; decisions to not create their own health care exchanges or 
expand Medicaid under the ACA have suppressed enrollment. According to Skocpol's resear=h, the 14 states that are 
expanding Medicaid and running their own exchanges have =een enrollment in Medicaid and exchanges at around 40 
percent of projections. 1= contrast, in the 23 states that refused to expand Medicaid or cooperate whe= it comes to an 
exchange, enrollment percentages are in the single-digits. 
The chart illustrates the vastly different experiences with Obamacare from state to state. Texas, which has the highest 
percentage of uninsured in the country and whose governor, Rick Perry (R), opted not to expand Medicaid and has 
called Obamacare a "criminal act," saw on=y about 14,000 people sign up using the exchange through the end of 
November, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. California, which=has a higher number of 
uninsured than Texas but a lower proportion, saw 107,087 people sign up through the state's exchange and 181,817 
qualify for the=state's Medicaid program through the end of November, according to federal data reported by the Los 
Angeles Times. Tens of thousands more signed up in California in December. 
Under the Affordable Care Act= states can either run their own exchange or have the Department of Health and Human 
Services run it for the=. Alternatively, seven states have opted for a federal-state partnership exchange. Many 
Republican governors wanted no ownership over the Obamacare exchanges and deferred to the federal government. 
The website of the federa= marketplace, HealthCare.gov, has been plagued by a botched rollout with man= glitches. 
Thanks to the Supreme Court decision that declared the law constitutional, governors are free to decline the federal 
money to expand Medicaid without losing the federal money they already received to insure low-income people. For 
reasons similar to why they didn't set up exchan=es, many Republican governors decided not to expand Medicaid under 
the law, des=ite the fact that the federal government plans to pick up all of the cost for n=wly eligible enrollees in the 
first three years and no less than 90 percent permanently. While community organizers in red states with high 
populations=of uninsured have tried to organize their own campaigns, the data suggests tha= it takes the power of a 
state to implement the health care law.
