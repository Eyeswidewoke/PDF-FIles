GIV update 
Jeffrey, 
sorry for the long email, may be best to read on Ipad or computer, but=l have to relay my thoughts on GIl and possible 
GIV purchase. 
Gary spoke to Juan Carlos (Enrique's business manager), currently Enri=ue is in the recording studio, Enrique has spoken 
to Juan regar=ing the deal that was presented. It is confirmed the only offer that was presen=ed to Enrique was Jack 
Pruitt's low ball offer / trade against the global=20 Express. Enrique has officially declined to purchase the Global Express 
since the numbers didn't make sense and many brokers where involved. Juan Carlos informed Gary that Enrique still has 
intere=ted in purchasing the Global and a deal with us could work. Gary knows th= owner of the Global Express, I 
believe Gary told me his name was Tom Blair,=and motivated to sell his Global Express. 
Juan Carlos has the $5.75M number in his mind, since that is what verbal offer from Puritt last year before engines 
needed overhaul= Here is what is on the table at this time, I told Gary we need to know=all commissions and no hidden 
payments. 
Gary recommends making your highest offer, Non negotiable, t= purchase this GIV direct to Juan and Enrique. Gary 
already infor=ed Enrique & Juan we are offering $5.2M. Juan's response to Gary was,="two years ago, Enrique had a 
$9M offer in which he turned down". Gary=20 told him the market will not bear much higher than $6M for his GI=. Juan 
listens to Gary, a verbal negotiation is fine at this point accor=ing to Gary. Enrique invested $1.63M for engine overhauls 
this month= which I confirmed with BizJet Engine overhaul shop. Enrique wants to purchase this Global Express but is 
leery of the market going lower on=the Global Express, as he's seen his GIV value hit below $6M now. (As Gary=s 
mentioned, Enrique changes his mind, and gets cold feet on these types=of transactions). 
Gary has been very honest and up front with me, to this point. I think=he is capable of putting together this deal. 
Gary is requesting $50,000 commission from us. 
Gary indicates Enrique would pay $50,000 to him also. 
Tom Blair would pay $50,000 to Gary. (his total commish $150k). 
Gary advises to make a firm Non negotiable final Offer $5.70M to Enriq=e for the GIV. Gary feels this number will sway 
Juan and Enrique to move fwd =nd release his GIV and pursue the Global Express, since its ready to fly and=20 Enrique 
likes the interior. 
This would be an owner to owner transaction with everybody knowing wha= monies are being distributed. 
My opinion for what its worth: 
I compare all the GIV's to the Reno aircraft with 3600 hours as I've s=ated before. 
I spoke to BizJet, John Hankhammer in GIV engine overhaul sales,=20 the engine facility that just completed the 
overhauls on Enrique'= GIV, I confirmed the cost for engine overhaul on a GIV is $8=5K per side. total $1.63M ,Next 
overhaul is 4000 hours or 10 calendar years, d=e date for Enrique's GIV engines is 11/01/2022. 
Enrique's GIV like the Reno GIV have been stored in hangers and it sho=s. The value is in the engines, all the Cockpits are 
the same in GIV's except =or HUD & EVS options, however the DU885 is the hot upgrade at this ti=e, Paul at Gulfstream 
informed me they have installed "30" DU885 cockpit=20 upgrades and "40" are scheduled for 2013 on a mixture of GIV's 
and GV's, The Reno GIV we had in contract for 6.1M had engines that would b= due overhaul in 2017, which is 5 years 
earlier than Enrique's aircraft. Si=ple formula, engines have value of $163,000 per year, since 10 year overhaul is=20 
$1.63M. My calculations of 5 years less engine time gives a $815,000 e=gine value to Enrique's plane compared to the 
Reno GIV which should have sold fo= $5.3M, but in fact, sold for $6M right after we canceled our contract. In=20 
conclusion, yes I believe $5.7M for Enrique would be a good buy, provided t=ey would agree to that number.
