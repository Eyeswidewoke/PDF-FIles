Getting =ested for HIT — Diamine oxidase activity and =istamine levels 
A test for diamine =xidase activity can bring you closer to piecing the puzzle together. If =he differential 
diagnosis has not solved the problem then it makes =ense to look into HIT. 
The diagnosis is established by =edical history taking and the determination of histamine and diamine =xidase 
before and after a 14-day histamine-free(sic) diet.' 
Details of the interpretation of results of these tests and =heir results can be found in the book Histamine 
Intolerance — =istamine and Seasickness by Reinhart larisch et al. (Spinger =ublishing, 2015). 
In the UK your GP can refer you to a =ab, where they can measure the DAO activity in your blood serum and 
=our histamine levels. Low DAO activity and high histamine levels are an =ndicator of HIT. Results are likely to be 
inaccurate if you are on a =ow-histamine diet when being tested. 
A diagnosis of =istamine intolerance is considered positive if two or more typical symptoms are present and 
improvement results from =ollowing a low-histamine diet and/or taking antihistamines.2
Keeping a food diary is essential so that you can track your =eactions to certain foods. This is also very helpful if 
you start an elimination diet. This would need to be worked out with a =a title="Useful Links" 
=ref="http://www.histamineintolerance.org.uk/index.php/useful-links/" =lass="">registered dietician. You will need to 
find out what your =hreshold is in what is called a re-introduction phase. 
Supplements 
Some scientific =esearchers recommend that HIT patients should take supplements of =strong class="">Vitamin 
B6 and a higher dosage of Vitamin C. Talk to your doctor about this =ecommendation. 
Antihistamines 
It has also =een recommended that as a precautionary measure HIT patients who tend =o have very severe 
reactions, such as anaphylactic shocks, should have = small emergency pack with them at all times. This would include 
some =orm of antihistamine. This is not a replacement for the diet, as =ntihistamines only block histamine and don't 
break it down the =ay DAO does. They may help reduce the symptoms, but they are not the =ure. 
The type of antihistamine: your doctor will need =o tell you which type is suitable for your individual situation. 
DAO food =upplements 
There are capsules containing =he enzyme diamine oxidase on the market but they do not in any way =eplace a 
low-histamine diet where you need to establish your threshold. =hether a constant long-term supplementation can lead 
to a worsening of =he condition still needs to be discussed further. 
Some pharmaceuticals =nhance symptoms 
If you are already =aking medication for the relief of symptoms or any other health reason, =our doctor will 
need to work out if this medication is =ounter-productive and you need to change to another product. 
There are substances used in different pharmaceuticals that =ave a negative effect on the DAO. For someone 
with HIT that means that =ymptoms get worse, not better. Do not change =edication before you have talked to your 
=edic, otherwise you may harm your health.
