Marci & Brett met with Craig's widow, Wendy Haesemeyer, to see if we could b 
e of assistance and she was not ready to move forward with a trust and she was still pretty shell-sh 
ocked about the unexpected death of her husband. Mike McCarthy had an appointment to meet with Wendy 
in March and flew to Los Angeles before heading to another meeting in San Francisco. Mrs Haesemeyer 
cancelled their appointment when he reached the airport in LA. Craig Haesemeyer has passed away.
