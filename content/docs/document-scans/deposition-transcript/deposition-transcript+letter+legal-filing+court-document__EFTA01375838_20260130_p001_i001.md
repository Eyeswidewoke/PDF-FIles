When seeking liquidity for a transaction on an agency or risk less principal basis, particularly orders 
involving large block sizes or other illiquid positions, DBSI may need to solicit indications of interest from

When facilitating a customer trade on a principal basis (i.e., by providing liquidity through the commitment 
of capital). DBSI may seek liquidity internally from Bank trading desks. This liquidity is sourced in a 
similar manner to how it is solicited externally for agency or riskless principal transactions, sharing 
appropriate information only.
