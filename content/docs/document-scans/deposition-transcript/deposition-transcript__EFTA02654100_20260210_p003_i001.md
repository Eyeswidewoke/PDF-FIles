payments well after I stopped using=the house, again with exorbitant taxes. Of course I also needed to l=ve, so that 
meant more withdrawals with exorbitant taxes. Under thos= conditions I requested some tax relief from the marital 
trust -- which, o= course, was established on the understanding that it would be available t= the survivor. 
Your reaction, to my amazem=nt, was to refuse, even under these remarkable circumstances, by imposing<=pan

could accept, no concern of yours. Of course, no such questions e=er were on even the remote horizon when I was 
trustee, before choosing you=to replace me, or on any other occasion when I arranged for funds to go to=you, either as 
an ample inheritance or for regular expenses. 
<=pan> 
Your letter now makes your reasoning very clear. Your propos=l is that you should remain in total control, 
evidently a matter of great =mportance for you. And following your principles, as exhibited with =rystal clarity under 
even the extreme circumstances just described, you ca= ensure that the funds in their entirety will go to you, though I 
suppose =n your kindness you might relax your strict regimen slightly when the day =omes, as it must, when I am no 
longer in a position to retain a shred of d=gnity and to refuse an intrusive and humiliating interrogation. 
However, there is a simpler way to realize your objectives, even more=fully. You can resign as trustee -- of 
course possible, just as I di= when I appointed you. We can then agree that you receive the entire=funds right now, 
instead of waiting until I die, so that you can use them =ight now for whatever purposes you like. Plainly that's more 
eff=cient, and even more lucrative for you than your suggestion. 
<=iv> 
It's true that this is one possible proposal, as you suggest.=/div> 
Another proposal is the one I suggested. True, there are so=e arcane tax issues, but these can easily be 
resolved, as your lawyer can =xplain to you, with common consent among the beneficiaries -- which means =our 
consent. 
<=iv>There are, of course, other possibilities.Q=A0 I could pursue legal measures to have the trust used in the 
manner in w=ich it was intended. I could also look into the disbursements that h=ve been made to family members (so I 
have learned) without informing me, a=d could look into why I haven't been receiving any income from the tru=t for 
years (until I finally raised the question), and why investments wer= made the way they were done, yielding long-term 
returns that would be of =o use for me, highly irregular for an elderly person -- which, as I wrote =ou, greatly surprised 
financial advisers I consulted when I finally began =o pay attention. And, furthermore, why I never received any 
statemen=s about what was going on for years, until I finally asked what is going o= with the trust. And perhaps other 
matters that evidently concern yo=, as shown by your request for protection for past actions. But I haven't yet shifted to 
your domain and still retain some illu=ions about family relations. 
There a=e other matters that I've written to you about several times, with no =esponse, which means I presume 
that you do not want to hear them. Th=y don't specifically have to do with this matter, so if you have gotte= this far in 
the letter, you can stop here. But they are on my mind,=and I want to clear the air -- if anyone wishes to look. 
My father could die in peace, knowing his children would ensure tha= his wife would be taken care of. I don L=3 
have that luxury.
