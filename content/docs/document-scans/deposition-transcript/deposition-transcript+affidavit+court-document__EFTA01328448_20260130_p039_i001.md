flight over specific areas. The operator must comply with any additional limitation prescribed by the 
applicable foreign author' y when operating in its airspace. (1)

do not provide any relief from any applicable law or regulation. This aircraft 
must be operated per 
pl 
le regulations and the additional limitations prescribed herein. Note that a 
clearance from air traff 
trot (ATC) is not authorization for a pilot to deviate from any rule, regulation, 
operating limitation, or 
icimum altitude, or to conduct unsafe operation of the aircraft. If ATC issues a 
clearance that would cii#e a pilot to deviate from a rule, regulation, or operating limitation, or in the 
pilot's opinion, would 
ce the aircraft in jeopardy, it is the pilot's responsibility to request an amended 
clearance. These op 
ng limitations are a part of FAA Form 8130-7 and are to be carried in the aircraft at 
all times and to be
