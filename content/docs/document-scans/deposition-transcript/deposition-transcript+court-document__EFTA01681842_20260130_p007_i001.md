"Don't forget Alan Dershowitz... JE' s buddy and lawyer -good name for your pitch as he 
repped Claus von Bulow and a movie was made about that case ._ title was Reversal of 
Fortune. We all suspect Alan is a pedo and tho no proof of that, you probably met him when

color preference he chose to sleep in because it reminded him of the same color of his own

wrapped a towel around his loins and answered the door completely calm. Opening the 
bedroom door and letting Alan inside they began to converse about business Immediately, 
right in front of me. Jeffrey started to tell Alan what needed to be done while he jostled some 
notes down quickly. I peeked my head from underneath the covers thinking they were too 
wrapped up in their work to notice me get up and dressed, and Jeffrey turned back to me and 
told me to just stay there this would only take a second. Going back to Alan he turned his

and returning his attention to me."
