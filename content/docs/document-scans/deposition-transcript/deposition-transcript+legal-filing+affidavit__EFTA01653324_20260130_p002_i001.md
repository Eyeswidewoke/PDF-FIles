approached in connection with our investigation say that he—or they—have immunity, or can't be prosecuted because 
of that agreement, that is incorrect. The non-prosecution agreement does not apply to the Southern District of New 
York, and even if it did, we are charging conduct beyond the scope of that agreement.) 
Criminal conduct overview: 
For a period of many years, including the early-mid 2000s, Epstein enticed dozens and possibly hundreds of underage 
girls to engage in sexual activity with him in exchange for money. The girls would go to his houses, including in Palm 
Beach, Florida, and Manhattan, New York, with the understanding that they were going to give a man an erotic massage 
and would be paid $200-300. During the massages, Epstein would have the girls take off some or all of their clothes, 
and then he would escalate the sexual nature of the massages, either during the first encounter or during subsequent 
encounters. The sexual activity included him groping victims and directly touching victims' genitals with his hands and 
with sex toys. 
In order to keep getting new young girls to exploit, Epstein would offer to pay these victims more money just to bring 
other new girls—the "recruiter" victims wouldn't have to perform the massages and the sexual acts, just the new girl 
would, and the "recruiter" victim would get paid the same amount of money (hundreds of dollars). Epstein or his 
associates would pay the girls in cash. Epstein's primary recruiters were young girls, including his victims, though we 
believe it is possible other individuals also assisted in recruiting (including possibly individuals listed below). To 
schedule these encounters, Epstein and his employees would call the girls, or the girls would call Epstein and his 
employees. We have records of phone messages from numerous girls to set up these encounters. 
Approaches:
Of the individuals we plan to approach immediately following the arrest, most are subjects of the investigation and may 
have direct knowledge of the crimes, or may have participated in them in some way. That includes: 
- 
Leslie Groff 
- 
Ghislaine (pronounced "Ghi-Lynn") Maxwell 
- 
Jean Luc Brunel 
- 
Leslie Wexner 
All of these individuals should receive subpoenas, and they can all be told that they can reach out directly to the 
prosecutor listed on the subpoena. If they want to have an attorney for any interaction with law enforcement, 
obviously that's totally fine, and they can be in touch with us if they'd like to have counsel appointed for them, or if they 
have their own counsel their attorney can contact us directly. 
All of them should feel free to reach out to the agent(s) they speak with, or the prosecutor on the subpoena (and we 
will loop in a case agent for those conversations if they occur). If they or their attorney contacts us prior to the grand 
jury deadline, they may not need to physically come to the grand jury on that date for testimony, but they must 
respond in some way before the deadline. 
*For anyone who is approached in person, we would want to get contact info to follow up with them if they do not 
respond to their subpoena.* 
For each of those individuals, if they are willing to be interviewed, we are interested in knowing about their knowledge 
of Epstein paying young girls for massages and sex acts. In particular: 
_Groff, -are 
all believed to have been employees of Epstein, and we believe they acted as 
schedulers for Epstein in various locations. They handled calls and messages for him, and we believe that each booked 
"massages" for him with underage girls. We want to know from them: 
• 
what their personal interactions were with young girls on behalf of Epstein
