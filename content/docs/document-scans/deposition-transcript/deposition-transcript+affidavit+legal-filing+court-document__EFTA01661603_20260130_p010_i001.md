Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa... Page 10 of 32 
investors -- the best gauge of market sentiment, he believes — are reacting to the markers movements. 
Then he will call currency traders in Europe. On a given day, he will spend ten hours or so on the phone 
— after all, he is running $15 billion essentially by himself. 
Strangely enough, given his scientific obsessions, he is a computer-phobe and does not use e-mail. "I 
like to hear voices and see faces when I interact," he has said. Given the huge sums he has to invest, he 
focuses on assets with extremely high liquidity, like currencies -- though he dabbles in commodities and 
real estate as well. Those who know him say he is an impulsive, quick-to-change-his-mind trader, still 
governed by Ace Greenberg's trader's maxim: If the stock is down 10 percent, sell it. He has been on the 
short side of the Brazilian real, and those close to him say bets there have paid off in spades. He recently 
took a long position on the euro before its rebound on the basis that Europeans were too proud to see 
their currency sink any lower against the dollar. His next targets: an across-the-board short of the 
German stock exchange and a possible attack on the Hong Kong dollar peg in light of the recent 
disclosure of North Korea's nuclear-weapons program. 
None of this is investment rocket science, but getting the direction and the timing right, no matter how 
conventional the investment idea, can spin large money for an investor. Before taking a big position, 
Epstein will usually fly to the country in question. He recently spent a week in Germany meeting with 
various government officials and financial types, and he has a trip to Brazil coming up in the next few 
weeks. On all of these trips, he flies alone in his commercial-jet-size 727. 
Friends of Epstein say he is horrified at the recent swell of media attention around him (Vanity Fair is 
preparing a megaprofile, and the Villard House office has had a barrage of calls from other media 
outlets). He has never granted a formal interview, and did not offer one to this magazine, nor has his 
picture appeared in any publication. Yet for one so obsessive about his privacy, one wonders -- didn't he 
realize that flying Clinton and Spacey around Africa was going to blow his cover? As he said to a friend: 
"If my ultimate goal was to stay private, traveling with Clinton was a bad move on the chessboard. I 
recognize that now. But you know what? Even Kasparov makes them. You move on."

Billionaire solicited prostitutes 3 times, indictment says 
By Larry Keller 
Palm Beach Post - Tuesday, July 25, 2006 
Billionaire money manager and Palm Beach part-time resident Jeffrey Epstein solicited or procured 
prostitutes three or more times between Aug. 1 and Oct. 31 of last year, according to an indictment 
charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. 
Epstein, 53, was booked at the Palm Beach County jail at 1:45 a.m. Sunday. He was released on $3,000 
bond. 
Epstein's case is unusual in that suspected prostitution johns are usually charged with a misdemeanor, 
and even a felony charge is typically made in a criminal information — an alternative to an indictment 
charging a person with the commission of a crime. 
His attorney, Jack Goldberger, declined to discuss the charge.
