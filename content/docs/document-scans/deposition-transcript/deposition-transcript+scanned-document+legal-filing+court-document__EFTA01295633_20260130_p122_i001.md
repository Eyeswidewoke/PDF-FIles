2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
evidence may not be raised in reply briefs. See 8azuaye v. 
79 F.3d 118. 120(9th Cu. 1996); Proven v. Miller, 102 F.3d 
1478. 1483 (9th Cir. 1996). Accordingly, the court STRIKES the new evidence filed in support of Green Tree's reply brief. See 
Toyer v. U.S. Postal SON.. 3 F.3d 1271. 1273 (9th Cir. 1993) (striking portions of a reply brief that presented new information); 
Nautilus Grp.. Inc. v. Icon Health S Fitness. Inc.. 306 F. Supp. 2d 1208. 1214 (VV.D. Wash. 2003) (striking a declaration with 
new evidence submitted in reply). Even it the count did consider Green Tree's new evidence the court is required to resolve all 
disputed facts in favor of the non•movirg party on summary judgment. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods.. Inc.. 530 U.S. 
133. 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097. 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). Therefore, for purposes of this motion only. the court relies on Mr. 
Steadman's testimony that he delivered the modification agreement on August 27, 2012. 
After delivering the signed modification agreement, Mr. Steadman began paying the 
modified monthly r6] loan payments to BoA. (Steadman Decl. at 1-2.) He submitted 
timely payments in the amount of $724.00 from September 2012 through May 2012 by 
calling BoA and paying over the phone. (Id. at 2; Steadman Dep. at 116:11-16.) 
On October 18, 2012, Mr. Steadman received a letter from BoA stating that it was "no 
longer considering your request for a modification because . . you notified us on October 
3, 2012, that you did not wish to accept the offer." (Steadman Dep. at 113:19-25; Ford 
Decl. Ex. 2 at 84-85.) Mr. Steadman denies declining the offer. (Steadman Dep. at 
113:25.) On October 23, 2013, Mr. Steadman received another letter from BoA stating that 
the payment it had recently received "was less than the total amount needed to bring your 
loan up to date," and if BoA did not receive the total amount by the specified acceleration 
date, "foreclosure proceedings may begin." (Steadman Dep. at 116:18-117:8; Ford Decl. 
Ex. 2 at 87-88.) 
Mr. Steadman states that after he received these letters, he called and visited Mr. Ngo and 
other BoA representatives multiple times to inquire as to the status of his modification. 
(Steadman Dep. at 113:13-117:11; Steadman Decl. at 2-3.) Mr. Steadman claims that the 
BoA ri representatives reassured him that his modification had been approved, and he 
was only receiving the letters because their system was behind in formally processing the 
approval. (Steadman Dep. at 113:13-117:11; Steadman Decl. at 2-3.) Mr. Steadman 
claims that the representatives advised him to keep making payments on the loan, which 
he did. (Steadman Dep. at 116:11-16.) Nonetheless, on May 15, 2013, BoA sent Mr. 
Steadman a letter informing him of his homeowner's rights and stating, "If you do not 
respond within 30 days, a notice of default may be issued and you may lose your home in 
foreclosure." (Ford Decl. Ex. 2 at 95-96; Steadman Dep. at 135:16-25.) 
On June 1, 2013, BoA transferred the servicing of Mr. Steadman's loan to Green Tree. 
(Ford Decl. Ex. 2 at 90-93 ("1st Transfer Letter"), 100-01 ("2d Transfer Letter").) Green 
Tree's notice of the transfer stated that, according to its records, Mr. Steadman's monthly 
payment was $1,165.08. (2d Transfer Letter.) Mr. Steadman attempted to make a payment 
to Green Tree in June 2012, but was informed that Green Tree was unable to locate his 
loan and "could not accept payments" on his account at that time. (Steadman Decl. at 3.) It 
was September r8] before Mr. Steadman was able to submit payments to Green Tree. 
(Steadman Decl. at 3.) Mr. Steadman made payments in the modified amount to Green 
Tree from September 2013 to December 2013. (Id.) 
In December 2013, Green Tree initiated foreclosure action against Mr. Steadman's 
property. (Ford Decl. Ex. 2 at 129, 134-36.) Mr. Steadman received a notice of foreclosure 
and a notice of a trustee's sale, which indicated that the amount outstanding on his loan 
was over $20,000.00. (Ford Decl. Ex. 2 at 138-39, 141-144.) When Mr. Steadman
