Hi 
— I am just writing to find out the status of the meeting with Epstein's counsel and to see if there is 
anything I can do to help move the process along. There are several reasons why a prompt answer is needed. 
First, 
and I will be meeting with 7 victims this week and I know that they will be concerned about the 
status of the case. The victims are moving away to college, graduatin from college, etc. In addition to being 
more difficult to find, they are, quite simply, getting older. As 
eloquently put it, "we need to do the 
trial before the girls start menopause." 
Second, I just received the duty roster, and Judge Marra has been set as the duty judge for February. Judge 
Marra originally prepared for the hearing on Epstein's motion to quash the subpoena for the computer equipment 
that was removed from his home in anticipation of the execution of a search warrant. We rescheduled the 
hearing several times for plea negotiations and, as part of the signed agreement, Epstein was supposed to 
withdraw the motion to quash, but never did. Getting it set up again before Judge Marra would be easy and 
advantageous to us. 
Third, we are getting into a "Catch-22" situation with the local FBI office. There are some very expensive things 
that we would like them to do in advance of the indictment (namely, interview victims in Australia and New 
York), but, given everyone's tight budgets, management doesn't want to spend that kind of money unless they 
know that we will indict. You can see the circular reasoning here. The FBI is still very anxious to proceed with 
this case, and I wondered whether having an FBI presence at the meeting with the defense would be helpful (the 
SAC here attended the last big meeting with defense counsel). 
Lastly, the delay is becoming unbearable for the investigators and for me. 
and I first met with the defense 
attorneys almost a year ago (on February 1st and 20th). The indictment package was presented to Miami on May 
1st. The non-prosecution agreement was signed on September 24, 2007. Epstein was supposed to begin serving 
his state sentence not later than January 4th of this year. I am concerned that Epstein will work out some slap on 
the wrist deal with the State (even weaker than the deal they already worked out), and Epstein will enter a guilty 
plea so he really can claim that there is a Petite policy violation (even though the State's charges relate only to 3 
girls, not all of the girls that are part of our case). 
I would appreciate any guidance that you can give. If there is any information that I can provide, I am more than 
willing to put together whatever you or 
might need. 
Thank you so much.
