Jeffrey, so basically you are going to break your promise because you would rather spend the 
weekend with Jenna. This is not just two more days, this weekend means waiting another 6 weeks 
before we can try again. I timed my trip so you would get exactly 2 weeks before I needed to be 
back, I am sure you remember I left on thursday instead of monday. I did what you wanted. 
Can you see that I can't trust what you tell me will or will not happen anymore. I find myself 
having to question every agreement we have made (no prostitutes staying in the house, in our bed, 
movies, naps, two weeks Alone, baby...) 
I would like to not have to worry that if you tell me something it will change the minute I look 
away. Your last minute suggestion to spend THIS weekend with prostitutes is just too much for 
me to handle. I can't live like this anymore, I'd rather have nothing to expect and therefore nothing 
to worry about. 
I think starting fresh is a good idea. How about we start from 0. I think since we first met our 
needs have changed and some things that were important back then are not a priority anymore... 
My suggestion is for a month from monday, forget about every rule or agreement we made in the 
past 6 years...bring your prosties to bed, watch movies, take naps,hug them kiss them, have them 
live at the house, let sarah act like she is in charge of the staff, bring anybody you want - kate or 
dasha, jcnna..,forgct about my ovulation this weekend, and I get to spend my time as I like. 
Its not a trick. You have it in writing. 
What photo is better the young innocent fat girl in the blue dress or the pretty figter jet assassin? 
If I get my lips done, I'd like to do the real thing not water.. Two weeks healing time is too much 
for just one day of yummy lips.
