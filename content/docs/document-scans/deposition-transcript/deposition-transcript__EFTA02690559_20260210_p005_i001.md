people in the neighborhoods calling anonymously and identifying bad guys to 
our military. They are now engaged in defeating the bad guys. These new 
tactics adopted by Petraeus in the Surge, plus our working with the Iraqi 
government and Iraqi people to play a more active role in the security of their 
country are what got us to where we are this summer. This is potentially a game 
changer. Some statistics (according to Admiral Fallon and supported by Gen. 
Petraeus) are interesting. The number of incidents of violence nationwide in 
Iraq is less than a tenth of what we were experiencing in the Spring of 2007. 
The casualty rate among American troops is the lowest in more than four years 
and continues to improve. Ethnic and sectarian violence among the Iraqi 
population has declined dramatically. When you look at the raw data, even the 
current numbers are too big, but the trend is clear. A dose of reality comes with 
statistics relating to the amount of arms caches found and cleared. They are 
currently running at 3-4 times the rate seen prior to the Surge. This is not 
because we have gotten better at finding arms caches. These are no longer 
Saddam's arms caches. The increased arms caches being found are as a result 
of Iran's reaction to our Surge. They initiated their own surge in response to 
ours. Theirs was the increased delivery of arms and training to the insurgents in 
Iraq. If anyone has any doubt about the context for Iraq, this statistic is very 
revealing.

The Experience. 
Once our invitation was in hand, I pushed the 
envelope of our itinerary both because I had some specific interests and 
because I wanted to be able to escape the Dept of Defense bubble. We went 
outside the wire in Basra and drove for 30 minutes to a fertilizer plant. I was 
told that five months ago (before the Battle of Basra) it is almost 100% certain 
that we would have been attacked on this route. 
We were in armored SUVs, 
we wore body amour and helmets we had 15 shooters to protect three of us and 
we had military GPS tracking us. We went to Babylon. We went by Blackhawk 
helicopters with machine gunners on either side of the chopper. We wore body 
amour and helmets and had several shooters in each chopper. We were met on 
the ground by the US general in charge of the region and boarded 6 MRAPs (go 
to Google for this one). We had about 20 shooters for the day. We visited the 
ruins of Babylon and we met with the governor and his economic development 
council. . We then went to a small farm and interviewed the farmer. He raised 
dates. Saddam's people came along 10 years ago and removed his thousand 
best trees to plant at a palace that Saddam built on top of the ruins of Babylon. 
Here, I should comment that one of Saddam's crimes against humanity is what 
he did at the ruins of Babylon, the cradle of western civilization. lie virtually 
paved over the ruins in order to create some strange personal playground for he 
and his friends. In Baghdad we had dinner at the house of an opposition MP. 
She is an architect who lived for many years in England. She came back a 
month after the invasion and, even in the face of serious threats to her life, she 
hasn't left. She had the previous Prime Minister, Alawi, over and we talked of 
kings and cabbages. I asked her if 50 years ago the Shia and the Sunni knew 
they were supposed to hate each other. She laughed and described the
