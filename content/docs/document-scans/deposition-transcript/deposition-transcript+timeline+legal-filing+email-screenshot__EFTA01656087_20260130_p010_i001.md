FBI Conducts Investigation at Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing In Indiana 
WRTV (ABC-6) (09/18, Howell) reported that federal agents, along with assistance from the Zionsville Police 
Department, conducted an investigation this morning at the Rahal Letterman Lanigan headquarters. The 
Indianapolis Star (09/18, Benbow) reported that Zionsville Mayor John Stehr said, "The FBI asked us to assist this 
morning as they served a warrant at the Rahal Letterman Lanigan headquarters building, our officers stayed 
outside as the FBI agents entered the building." Racer (09/18, Pruett) reported that the FBI is alleged to have 
instructed employees within RLL to leave their computers and related electronic devices in place, gather their 
belongings, and depart the building as agents began an investigation. The source of the investigation is alleged to 
involve a former employee of the Andretti Global IndyCar team, who left the team to join RLL in a senior 
engineering role, and the alleged transfer of intellectual property from their former team to their current 
team. The FBI is also alleged to have visited the Andretti shop in August to look for proof of possible IP-related 
improprieties. WXIN (Fox-59) (09/18, Schroeder) also reported on the story. 
Florida Sheriff Spending Detailed Amid Possible FBI Investigation 
WBBH (NBC-20) (09/18, Elias) reported that the outlet has uncovered new documents that reveal tens of 
thousands of tax dollars going to consulting fees inside the Lee County Sheriff's office each month. This is after 
allegations of money laundering and claims that Sheriff Carmine Marceno is under investigation by the FBI. 
According to the article, the contract for former honorary deputy and consultant Ken Romano shows he was paid 
$5,700 a month and he claims he was ordered to give back $1,700 to the sheriff's father to help pay for a car. 
Meanwhile, the outlet has uncovered 14 other similar contracts with people who are receiving taxpayer money 
including a former state senator, a personal trainer, and even what appears to be a dog. The contracts 
combined total a whopping $53,000 a month in taxpayer money or $636,000 annually. Romano signed a contract 
to work as a contractor for Marceno and it shows he was paid $5,700 a month for what he said in a recording, was 
next to no work. "If I went in five times in the six months I worked there, it was a lot," Romano could be heard 
saying in a recording that has reportedly been turned over to the FBI by Marceno's former deputy and now write-in 
opponent in the November election. Romano said every month he would take $1,700 and funnel it to Marceno's 
father so he could pay for a Mercedes. The article added that FGCU Constitutional Law Professor Dr. Pamela Seay 
explained that with an active FBI investigation, it's more likely that not all participants, including the sheriff, have 
been asked not to comment until the investigation is complete. 
Two Juveniles Charged With Felonies for Allegedly Making School Shooting Threats in Indiana 
CBS News (09/18, Bizzle) reported that a 14-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy from Northwest Indiana are facing 
charges, accused of making threats about school shootings this week. The Lake County Sheriffs Department said a 
police officer on Sunday was made aware of a girl, 14, from Gary, Indiana, who reportedly posted a threatening 
comment to a TikTok video. The article added that during an investigation, the suspect told police she was viewing 
a video on TikTok and posted a comment about shooting at a school, but couldn't remember the exact statement 
and that it did not mention a specific school or student. Relatives of the girl confirmed that she had told them 
about the comment. The officer also learned that the FBI had been investigating the incident. They found the 
account where the post was made and tracked it to a phone at a Gary address. The account originally displaying the 
comment has since been banned by TikTok, the department said. The girl was placed into custody at the Lake 
County Juvenile Center and was charged with felony intimidation.

WCNC (NBC-36) (09/18, Ruffes) reported that the disappearance of the 9-year-old from Shelby 24 years ago 
"haunts" retired FBI agent Richard Shaffer, who said he carried her photo with him for years. According to the 
article, it has been more than 24 years since Richard Shaffer arrived on scene in Shelby, called in by then-Cleveland 
County Sheriff Dan Crawford to help investigate the disappearance of a 9-year-old girl from her home. Even after all 
that time, the retired FBI agent still remembers the neighborhood and first interaction with Asha Degree's 
family. Investigators learned Asha disappeared from her bedroom in the middle of the night on Valentine's Day, 
sometime between 2:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. There was no sign of forced entry and no promising scent trail for
