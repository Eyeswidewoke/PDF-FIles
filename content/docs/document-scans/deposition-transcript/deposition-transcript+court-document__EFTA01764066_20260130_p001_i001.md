Jeffrey, 
sorry for the long email, may be best to read on Ipad or computer, but I have to relay my thoughts on GIl and 
possible GIV purchase. 
Gary spoke to Juan Carlos (Enrique's business manager), currently Enrique is in the recording studio, Enrique has 
spoken to Juan regarding the deal that was presented. It is confirmed the only offer that was presented to Enrique was 
Jack Pruitt's low ball offer / trade against the global Express. Enrique has officially declined to purchase the Global 
Express since the numbers didn't make sense and many brokers where involved. Juan Carlos informed Gary that Enrique 
still has interested in purchasing the Global and a deal with us could work. Gary knows the owner of the Global Express, 
I believe Gary told me his name was Tom Blair, and motivated to sell his Global Express. 
Juan Carlos has the $5.75M number in his mind, since that is what verbal offer from Puritt last year before 
engines needed overhaul. 
Here is what is on the table at this time, I told Gary we need to know all commissions and no hidden payments. 
Gary recommends making your highest offer, Non negotiable, to purchase this GIV direct to Juan and Enrique. 
Gary already informed Enrique & Juan we are offering $5.2M. Juan's response to Gary was, "two years ago, Enrique had 
a $9M offer in which he turned down". Gary told him the market will not bear much higher than $6M for his GIV. Juan 
listens to Gary, a verbal negotiation is fine at this point according to Gary. Enrique invested $1.63M for engine overhauls 
this month, which I confirmed with BizJet Engine overhaul shop. Enrique wants to purchase this Global Express but is 
leery of the market going lower on the Global Express, as he's seen his GIV value hit below $6M now. (As Gary's 
mentioned, Enrique changes his mind, and gets cold feet on these types of transactions). 
Gary has been very honest and up front with me, to this point. I think he is capable of putting together this deal. 
Gary is requesting $50,000 commission from us. 
Gary indicates Enrique would pay $50,000 to him also. 
Tom Blair would pay $50,000 to Gary. (his total commish $150k). 
Gary advises to make a firm Non negotiable final Offer $5.70M to Enrique for the GIV. Gary feels this number 
will sway Juan and Enrique to move fwd and release his GIV and pursue the Global Express, since its ready to fly and 
Enrique likes the interior. 
This would be an owner to owner transaction with everybody knowing what monies are being distributed. 
My opinion for what its worth: 
I compare all the GIV's to the Reno aircraft with 3600 hours as I've stated before. 
I spoke to BizJet, John Hankhammer in GIV engine overhaul sales, the engine facility that just completed the 
overhauls on Enrique's GIV, I confirmed the cost for engine overhaul on a GIV is $815K per side. total $1.63M ,Next 
overhaul is 4000 hours or 10 calendar years, due date for Enrique's GIV engines is 11/01/2022.
