E. 
I reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, to transfer to the 
Trustees, by gift, by Will or by beneficiary designation, such additional property, including life 
insurance policies, as I may desire. Any such additional property shall be held on the same terms 
as are then applicable to the original Trust Estate, except that it may be transferred subject to 
conditions and provisions of special application to such additional property. 
Article II 
After My Death 
The following provisions shall apply after my death: 
Section 2.1. - Payment of My Debts and of Taxes and Expenses 
The Trustees shall pay from the principal of the Trust Estate (a) my debts, funeral and 
burial expenses and the administration expenses of my probate estate which are not paid by the 
Executors of my probate estate, and (b) the federal and state estate, inheritance, succession, 
generation skipping and similar taxes imposed by reason of my death which are the obligations 
of the Trustees (including any of such taxes which the Executors of my probate estate direct the 
Trustees to pay by written direction delivered to the Trustees). For purposes of this Section 2.1, 
the principal of the Trust Estate shall not include (a) any assets which are not included in my 
Gross Estate or (b) any assets which are not subject to, or available to creditors for the payment 
of, my debts, my funeral and burial expenses or the administration expenses of my probate 
estate. 
Section 2.2. — Specific Bequests and Devises under My Will and Trust 
If my probate estate is insufficient to satisfy all pecuniary bequests (or bequests payable 
in cash or in kind in the discretion of the Executors of my probate estate) provided in my Will, 
the Trustees shall pay such unpaid bequests from the principal of the Trust Estate. If my Will 
provided for a specific bequest or devise of specified assets and such bequest or devise could 
not be satisfied from my probate estate because such assets were held by the Trustees at my 
death, the Trustees shall distribute such assets to satisfy such bequest or devise. 
To the extent the assets of the Trust are insufficient to satisfy all bequests provided for 
in this Agreement, I direct the Trustees to first pay all specific bequests in Article II, Sections 
2.3(A)(17), (40), (42), and (45) of this Agreement, and the bequests in Article II, Sections 
2.3(A)(41) and (43) of this Agreement, then next to comply with the provisions of Article II, 
Sections 2.3(A)(7), (23), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37), and (38) of this Agreement, and to the extent 
assets are insufficient to pay all of the remaining bequests in Article II, Section 2.3(A) of this 
Agreement, then the beneficiaries of all such remaining bequests in Article II, Section 2.3(A) of 
this Agreement shall share on a proportionate basis in the remaining estate assets available for 
distribution. The determination of the Trustees as to the amounts distributable herein shall be 
binding on all parties. 
Section 2.3. - Bequests 
A. 
I make the following bequests:
