Keeping Options Ope= 
In the United State=, however, it has long been speculated that the wider shafts could be inte=ded for ballistic missiles 
armed with nuclear warheads. This suspicion was=fueled by an Israeli request for US Tomahawk cruise missiles in 2000. 
The missiles have a range of over 600 ki=ometers, while nuclear versions can even fly about 2,500 kilometers. But 
W=shington rejected the request twice. This is why the Israelis still rely o= ballistic missiles of their own design today, 
such as Popeye Turbo. 
Their use as nuclea= carrier missiles is readily possible in the Dolphins. Contrary to officia= assumptions, HDW equipped 
the Israeli submarines with a newly developed h=draulic ejection system instead of a compressed air ejection system. In 
this process, water is compressed wit= the help of a hydraulic ram. The resulting pressure is then used to catap=lt the 
weapon out of the shaft. 
The resulting momen=um is limited, however, and it isn't enough to eject a three to five-ton m=drange missile out of the 
ship, at least according to insiders. This is no= the case with lighter-weight missiles weighing up to 1.5 tons -- like the 
Popeye Turbo or the American Tomahawk,=which weighs just that, nuclear warhead included. 
There are indicatio=s that, with the expanded tubes, the Israelis wanted to keep open the opti=n of future, more 
voluminous developments. 
The Germans and the=Atomic Question: No Questions, No Problems 
The Germans don't w=nt to know anything about that. "It was clear to each of us, without =nything being said, that the 
ships had been tailored to the needs of the I=raelis, and that that could also include nuclear capabilities," says a senior 
German official involved during =he Kohl era. "But in politics there are questions that it's better no= to ask, because the 
answer would be a problem." 
To this day, former=German Foreign Minister Genscher and former Defense Minister Volker Ruhe s=y they do not 
believe that Israel has equipped the submarines with nuclear=weapons. 
For their part, exp=rts with the German military, the Bundeswehr, do not doubt the nuclear cap=bility of the 
submarines, but they do doubt whether cruise missiles could =e developed on the basis of the Popeye Turbo that could 
fly 1,500 kilometers. 
Some military exper=s suggest, therefore, that the Israeli government is bluffing, in a bid to=make Iran believe that the 
Jewish state already has a sea-based second-str=ke capability. That alone would be enough to force Tehran to commit 
considerable resources to defending itsel=.The first person to publicly voice suspicions that the German government =as 
supporting Israel in its nuclear weapons program was Norbert Gansel, an=SPD politician from Kiel. Speaking in the 
German parliament, the Bundestag, he stated that the SPD opposed th= shipment of "submarines suitable for nuclear 
missions" to Israe=. 
Clearly Squirming c=span> 
The German governme=t did make at least one stab at clearing up the nuclear issue. It was in 1=88, when Defense 
Ministry State Secretary Lother Ruhl, during a visit to=lsrael, asked then Deputy Chief of General Staff Ehud Barak what 
the "operational and strategic purpose of the s=ips" was. "We need them to clear maritime maneuvering areas,&quo=; 
Barak replied. The Israeli mentioned the Egyptian naval blockage of the =ulf of Aqaba ahead of the Six-Day War. The 
Israelis wanted to be armed against such a step, he said. It sounded plausible, but=RUhl didn't believe it. 
Every German admini=tration has been keenly aware of how explosive the issue is. When the Germ=n Finance Ministry 
had to report the funds for the financing of submarines=4 and 5 in 2006, the ministry officials were clearly squirming.
