New York has the smartest, toughest, most ambitious men in the world, and some of them are still single - or 
newly single, having gotten divorced. We went through our multiple data bases, interviewed the experts, polled 
our readers, and came up with this definitive PAGE SIX list of the city's most eligible guys. 
They come from all sorts of backgrounds and generations, with different talents and widely divergent incomes. 
The only thing they have in common is they like women. 
We rejected some men because they seem to be in long-term romances heading toward marriage, others 
because it seems they'll never many. To the many men who think they belong on the list, there's always next 
year.

tournament every year in Boca Raton, Fla. 
JEREMY SHOCKEY, 23. The Giants' tight end became a fan favorite with his first tackle-breaking game. Now 
he's the biggest local gridiron personality since Joe "Willie" Namath. Pro: Quite single despite his friendship with 
babelicious Britny Gastineau. Con: His big mouth often misfires, as when he blasted Giants fans because they 
had the nerve to boo him and his disappointing teammates. 
ANDRE BALAZS, 46. The ever-smiling hotelier - who owns The Mercer in Soho, Chateau Marmont and the 
Standard in L.A., the Raleigh in Miami, Sunset Beach on Shelter lasland, and a new place in St. Baits - just split
