What next for the euro now that our 1.20 EUR/USD t=rget has been met so soon? The ECB meeting is coming up 
next week and there=are rising risks of verbal intervention from Mario Draghi. Despite this the euro level does not 
appear particularly=extreme and most importantly the ECB has not been driving recent appreciati=n anyway. ECB verbal 
rhetoric may cause a correction but is unlikely to be e=ough to derail euro strength. We see the risks as still skewed 
towards the euro overshooting above 1.20 a= some point this year rather than permanently reversing lower. 
First, on technical=, we highlighted earlier in the year that the EUR/USD range was too narrow. The rally up to 
1.20 brings the year's EUR/US= range to 17 big figures, a little below the average since 2010. In other w=rds, there is 
nothing "unusual" about the current size of t=e EUR/USD move compared to the last few years (chart 1). 
Second, on valuatio= grounds, EUR/USD is only just now approaching "fair value" on a number of our metrics. 
Our estimate of purchasing power=parity (PPP) for the euro is 1.23 (chart 2). Our fundamental effective exch=nge rate 
(FEER) model which adjusts for the euro's large current ac=ount surplus is 3% higher. The BEER model which adjusts PPP 
for productivity and terms of trade is a little lower. The same=conclusions apply to the trade-weighted index, there is 
nothing unusual abo=t the euro's current valuations. 
Third, on speculati=e positioning, while longs have been building, they are not particularly extreme. The 
aggregate non-commercial long on the CFTC=is at the 90th percentile going back to 1999, but this does not account 
for=rising trading volumes over time. Adjusting for open interest, longs are on=y at the 56th percentile, close to average 
since the euro's inception. For hedge funds specifically=the euro long is even lower at around the 40% percentile (chart 
3).<=:p> 
Fourth, on portfoli= flows, the most important question for the euro is whether the structural underweight that 
has built up post-crisis has been a=justed. The IMF portfolio survey (CIPS) is the most comprehensive data sour=e for this 
and as of last year it showed that American and European investo=s' euro allocations were close to decade lows (chart 
4). Reserve managers have been holding an underweight=too (charts 5). Even though this data is very lagged, the key 
observation i= that it has taken a very long time to build the underweights and it will l=kely be difficult to cover in just a 
few months. 
Taking it all together the 1.20 level in EUR/USD does=not seem particularly extreme. The single biggest risk to 
EUR appreciation i= its pace. With the trade-weighted having risen by more than 5% in just three months, this has 
typically driven verba= intervention by both Trichet and Draghi in the past (chart 6). Despite thi=, verbal intervention 
may not be a game changer. First, everyone is now exp=c-ting it. Second, for verbal intervention to be credible the ECB 
will need to abort its QE exit plans fo= October. Our economists do not believe EUR strength is large enough for th=s to 
happen. The current level of the euro would only require a 0.2% upward=revision to European growth over the forecast 
horizon to maintain the ECB's inflation path. It is only a= 1.25 or above where tapering would be aborted (chart 7). Third, 
the Fed re=ction function is just as important and it will be very difficult for the m=rket to aggressively re-price the Fed in
