Protein power 
HOW did Shaquille O'Neal prepare for last night's Game 2 of the NBA Eastern Finals pitting his Miami Heat 
against the Detroit Pistons? By devouring a 48-oz. porterhouse ($76) at South Beach's trendiest steakhouse, 
Prime 112, the night before. The 7-foot-1, 320- lb. center joined fellow carnivores Jamie Foxx and TNT analyst 
Charles Barkley, who as usual was trashing the Knicks. There's one menu item Shaq steers clear of - the $20 
"Kobe Hot Dog." 
Keepin' it real 
IS life imitating art? Blond bombshell Katheryn Winnick, who was so good as lvana Trump in Tuesday night's 
"Trump Unauthorized" on ABC, must have liked her brush with real estate fame. The Post's Lois Weiss reports 
the actress was seen canoodling with one of the city's top real estate investment-sale brokers, Douglas Harmon 
of Eastdil, Tuesday afternoon, before she got into a black Lincoln in front of 40 W. 57th St., the building where 
Harmon is headquartered. 
Paris burger ad not for kids? 
PARIS Hilton is too hot for Washington. Lawmakers are working behind the scenes to get her sizzling TV ad for 
eatery chain Carl's Jr. - in which she writhes half-naked on a Bentley, cavorts with a garden hose and sucks her 
finger - banishedto late night. Sources say several influential pols have quietly told networks the commercial, 
labeled "basically soft-core porn" by the Parents Television Council, isn't fit for children and shouldn't air before 
10 p.m. The eye-popping ad, in which Paris looks like she's getting ready for her next Rick Solomon, is great 
publicity for Carl's Jr., which hired the hotel hottie to hawk its new Spicy Burger. The fast- food firm's official 
response to those who are seeing red? "Get a life." 
Sudden dash 
DAMON Dash, with gorgeous wife Rachel Roy in tow, basked in the glory of receiving an AAFA American Image 
Award from Kevin Bacon at the Grand Hyatt, but dashed out without offering a donation to the event's charity 
partner, the Alzheimer's Association. The hip-hop mogul was apparently the only honoree who didn't donate to 
the event. Dash's publicist told us he did make a donation - but nobody connected to the event was aware of it. 
Axed reporter branded 
YOU can't watch Arthur Chi'en on WCBS/Ch. 2 any more - the reporter was fired last week for uttering the "f 
word" on-air - but you can buy a plethora of products with his face on it. Cafepress.com is hawking a line of 
Chi'en-branded mugs, T-shirts, buttons, tote bags, messenger bags, barbecue aprons, teddy bears and even a 
"Chi'en Classic Thong." Some are emblazoned with the words, "What the (bleep] is your problem, man?" - the 
question Chi'en, who thought he was off the air, yelled out to twohecklers. David Yee, who is selling the Chi'en 
merchandise, said he was inspired by the popular T-shirts of revolutionary Che Guevara. "Chi'en sort of sounds 
like Che," he explained. "People are buying it." Meanwhile, Chi'en's friend Ian Gerard, the founder of Gen Art, 
has circulated an e-mail calling the firing "ridiculous," and urging recipients to complain to various Viacom and 
Channel 2 executives. Chi'en tells us he was "devastated" by his dismissal, and says he's currently looking for a 
new job. "I've got bigger things to worry about than the shirts, basically," he said. 
Call to mouths 
KELLY Osboume thinks her Hollywood friends are too thin. "Sure they're beautiful in photographs. But when you 
see them in person, they look hungry and miserable," she tells Teen Vogue. "I hate to name names, so I'm not 
going to, but there's one in particular I think of often. I saw her last summer and remember thinking, 'You're so 
beautiful, you're at the most perfect weight.' And then I ran into her in the winter and she literally looked near 
death. I was like, 'What are you doing to yourself? You're 18 years old."' Interestingly, the magazine's June/July 
issue features shrunken Lindsay Lohan on the cover.
