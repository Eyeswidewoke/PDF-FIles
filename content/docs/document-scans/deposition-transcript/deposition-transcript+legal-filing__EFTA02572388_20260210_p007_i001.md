We know the demand for coverless 64GB as well. Our margin structure is based on 110% attach. Less than that is 
problematic. All of this was known in the move to $499 coverless. The retail model we have in place focuses on attach, 
but is a risky margin proposition and stock out of colors can be a real issue.

Enterprise. I'm excited to open this up. It is tough to see this as a material impact to the overall model. 
• 
Product quality. I think this is a red herring. We've seen nothing at all to indicate product quality issues. Even 
twitter is silent on quality issues. The tone of product reviews started off positive and is increasing. The 8% number 
doesn't match the data we have but even then is close to the modeled number at 6%. Regardless, I don't know what we 
would do other than merchandising and scripts to change this since the product is what it is. 
Supply chain. I think we've worked this out and know how to scale. 
• 
USA retail. I will defer. In many ways this is the least of our challenges given our footprint in the US. I have a hard 
time thinking WMT would stock us effectively given the low priced tablets they sell currently. 
I'm not trying to be flip and not pay due to these issues. What I want to say is that all of them are being worked on. I 
think we have three courses of action: 
• 
Plan starting now on how we expand for January. We can call this plan of record. I am not so sure it was. In any 
event let's do that now. It still involves folks getting rolling now. So we need to get them going. 
• 
With those dialogs happening we can see what we can execute in Europe, Aus now. This is where we have no 
"see and buy" presence and we can definitely get something going—at least folks think so. We should allow them to 
have the dialog. 
• 
Decide on a US plan. This seems a separate choice given the footprint we have here. 
There is a fourth action which is we essentially do nothing now. I don't think anyone is recommending that. 
Arguably there is an option where we just do way more marketing outreach to hope that is a substitute for physically 
touching the device for Holiday. 
What concerns me is that we're not having a dialog about the material issue. 1M units/$500M in inventory on 1/1 is a 
major problem and that grows by 250K units per week. There are only two ways to fix this. We sell more between now 
and 1/1 or we stop the manufacturing line. If we stop the line it is a crazy high cost since startup is high. This is just 
manufacturing management. Even slowing it down means letting workers go. If we don't sell more we're going to need 
a new building to hold all the inventory. This is the real issue. Everything else feels like tactical issues to address relative 
to either selling more or making less. 
I feel like under any circumstances we should unblock people from going to retailers and having the dialog about 
January. You indicate we need time to plan this and so we need to start. We can let them do this over the week and
