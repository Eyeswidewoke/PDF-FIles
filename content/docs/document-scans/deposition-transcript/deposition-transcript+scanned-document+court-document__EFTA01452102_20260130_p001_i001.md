SOF III -1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Commitment up to an amount equal in the aggregate to the Defaulted Commitment. The 
General Partner shall make notifications under the Act and such revisions to the Register 
as may be necessary to reflect the change in Partners and Commitments contemplated by 
this Section 5.7(c). 
(d) 
Forfeiture and Application of Forfeited Amounts. The General Partner 
may in its reasonable discretion take any or all of the following actions with respect to a 
Defaulting Partner: (i) reduce amounts otherwise distributable to such Defaulting 
Partner on or after the date of such Default by 50% and withhold the remaining 50% of 
such amounts until the dissolution of the Fund and (ii) require such Defaulting Partner to 
remain fully liable for payment of amounts in respect of the General Partner's Share (as 
calculated in respect of such Defaulting Partner) and its pro rata share of Organisational 
Expenses and Fund Expenses as if the Default had not occurred. The General Partner 
may apply amounts otherwise distributable to such Defaulting Partner in satisfaction of 
all amounts payable by such Defaulting Partner. In addition, such Defaulting Partner 
shall have no further right to advance Loans to participate in any Portfolio Investment 
and shall be treated for purposes of Sections 5.4 and 5.6 as no longer a Partner. The 
General Partner may charge such Defaulting Partner interest on the Defaulted Amount 
and any other amounts not timely paid at a rate per annum equal to the higher of (A) 
LIBOR plus 2% and (B) 8% from the date such amounts were due and payable through 
the date that full payment of such amounts is actually made or, if such amounts are not 
paid, through the end of the Term, and to the extent not paid such interest charge may be 
deducted from amounts otherwise distributable to such Defaulting Partner. Amounts 
forfeited and not otherwise applied to the payment of the expenses specified in clause (ii) 
of the first sentence of this Section 5.7(d) or in Section 5.7(e), plus any interest thereon, 
shall be distributed to the Non-Defaulting Partners in proportion to their Commitments, 
provided that no Non-Defaulting Partner shall receive a distribution in respect of a 
Portfolio Investment with respect to which such Partner is an Excused Partner. The 
General Partner shall make such adjustments, including adjustments to the Partner 
Accounts of the Partners (including such Defaulting Partner), as it determines to be 
appropriate to give effect to the provisions of this Section 5.7. 
(e) 
Other Remedies, Payment of Expenses. The General Partner shall have 
the right to pursue all remedies available to it with respect to the Default of a Defaulting 
Partner. No course of dealing between the General Partner and any Defaulting Partner 
and no delay in exercising any right, waiver or remedy conferred in this Section 5.7 or 
now or hereafter existing by statute or otherwise shall operate as a waiver or otherwise 
prejudice any such right, waiver or remedy. In addition to the foregoing, the General 
Partner may, in its sole discretion, institute a lawsuit against any Defaulting Partner for 
specific performance or specific implementation of its obligation to advance Loans and 
any other payments to be made by a Limited Partner pursuant to this Agreement and to 
collect any overdue amounts hereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Agreement, each Limited Partner agrees, in the event of a Default by such Partner, to pay
