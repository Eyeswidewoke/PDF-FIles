And now, the IMF has ma=e the first move. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, the IMF 
of=icially green-lighted the acceptance of China's currency 
Q=93 the Yuan — into the IMF's foreign exchange basket.Q=A0 This marks the first time in 
history the IMF has expanded the number of=currencies in the foreign 
exchange basket. This means that the Ch=nese currency will now become a viable global 
alternative to the US dollar= 
According to Juan Zarate, who helped implement financial sanct=ons while serving in George W. 
Bush's Treasury department, Q=9COnce the [other currency] becomes an alternative to the dollar, rules of=the game 
begin to change." 
Leong Sing Chiong, Assistant=Managing Director at a major central bank, said this dollar 
alternative =E2nis likely to transform the financial landscape in the next 5-10 ye=rs." 
Currency expert Dr. Steve Sjuggerud warned, Q=9CI've been active in the markets for over two 
decades now, but I=E2Q.ve never seen anything that could move so much money, so quickly.=C2Q The 
announcement will start a domino effect, that will basically det=rmine who in America gets rich in the years to come, 
and 
who struggles.=/div> 
Dr. Sjuggerud says if you own any US "paper" as=ets - and that includes stocks, bonds, or just 
cash in a bank account Q=804, you should be aware of what's 
about to happen and know ho= to prepare. A number of experts believe a recent spike in gold 
and =ilver prices is a direct result of the IMF's action. Preciou= metals notoriously rise when the US dollar falls. 
The Death of=the US Dollar in One Frightening Graph 
For the last 600 years, =here have been six different global reserve currencies controlled by 
world=superpowers. The latest — the US dollar — has dominated wo=ld currency for over 80 years. The alarming fact is, 
global 
reserve c=rrencies have collapsed every 80-90 years for the last six centuries! What=does this 
mean for America and the dominance of the US dollar? Based on re=ent evidence and long-standing historical trends, 
experts predict the i=minent collapse of the US dollar! What's more alarming? Many Ameri=ans 
aren't yet doing the one thing that will save their savings &a=p; retirement from US dollar collapse. 
Just take a look at the =raph below. It shows the lifespan of dominant currencies going back 600 
ye=rs. Notice that the US dollar has now been the dominant currency for 88 ye=rs, about the same length of time as its 
predecessors. 
ItQ=99s obvious why experts say that the US dollar's days as the world=8244s reserve 
currency are coming to a climactic end. 
All F=at Currencies Collapse 
"Fiat" currency is paper=currency backed by nothing tangible. As opposed to "sound 
moneyQ=80Q which is backed by gold or some other valuable commodity, a fiat cur=ency is backed by nothing more 
than faith in the government. The US dollar=has been a fiat currency since Nixon closed the gold window in 
1971 in =hat was the greatest heist in American history. The scary fact is, the ave=age life span 
of a fiat currency is 40 years, and the US dollar 
has now=exceeded 40 years as a fiat currency!
