Hi Tom. 
I have been asked to work with Leon, Josh and Marc's tax advisors to ev=luate whether certain deferral 
techniques might be appropriate for the individual= in light of the need to refinance indebtedness of AMH and the 
potential to exchange exisiting Apollo Group interests for AGM units. I believe you might be familiar with some of what 
I am referring to. Is there a time late afternoon today or afternoon tomorrow that we could meet or have = call to 
discuss Leon's situation and give you background on the work I we have been doing around t=ese issues? Should Eileen 
or Ada be involved with this as well? 
Look forward to speaking with you. 
Regards
