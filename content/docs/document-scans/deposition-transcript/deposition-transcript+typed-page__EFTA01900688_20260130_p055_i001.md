her from the state registry and relieving that person from any registration obligations. This 
remedy is not self-executing; rather, it requires the registrant to file papers in a local court and to 
prove entitlement to relief, and for the court to grant relief. Less than one month after 5 Act 402 
became law, four plaintiffs,3 proceeding pseudonymously, on their behalf and on behalf of others 
similarly situatcd,4 sued the defendants in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in this 
Court. These plaintiffs allege that they and the class they seek to represent are identically 
situated to the prevailing plaintiffs in Doe 1.5 As in Doe I, plaintiffs here have sued James D. 
Caldwell, Attorney General of the State of Louisiana; James M. Leblanc, Secretary, Louisiana 
Department of Public Safety and Correction; Michael Edmondson, Superintendent, Louisiana 
State Police; Charles Dupuy, Deputy Superintendent, Louisiana State Police; Eugenie C. 
Powers, Director, Division of Probation and Parole, Louisiana Department of Public Safety and 
Corrections; Barry Matheny, Assistant Director, 3 Since one of the plaintiffs voluntarily 
dismissed his claims on October 29, 2012, there are now three anonymous plaintiffs proceeding 
on behalf of a putative class. 4 Plaintiffs estimate approximately 484 individuals statewide must 
register as sex offenders solely as a result of a Crime Against Nature by Solicitation conviction. 
They present class action allegations in which they suggest that class treatment is warranted 
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2). 5 Plaintiffs allege that "No plaintiff 
has been convicted of any other crime that requires registration as a sex offender." In fact, each 
plaintiff alleges that he or she has been convicted of Crime Against Nature by Solicitation for 
agreeing to perform oral sex for money and must register as a sex offender solely as a result of a 
Crime Against Nature by Solicitation conviction prior to August 15, 2011, pursuant to La.R.S. 
15:542, et seq. "The prostitution statute encompasses all the criminal conduct alleged to have 
been committed by plaintiffs[; h]owever," plaintiffs allege, "because Plaintiffs were charged with, 
and convicted of, Crime Against Nature by Solicitation rather than prostitution, they are 
required to register as sex offenders." 6 Division of Probation and Parole, Louisiana Department 
of Public Safety and Corrections; and Stephen Campbell, Commissioner, Office of Motor 
Vehicles; each defendant is sued in his or her official capacity.6 Plaintiffs allege that: The[se] 
defendants, by continuing to require plaintiffs and all other individuals similarly situated to 
register as sex offenders, are violating the rights guaranteed to the named plaintiffs and the 
plaintiff class under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs seek 
a judgment declaring that the defendants' actions violate the rights of individuals required to 
register as sex offenders pursuant to a CANS conviction to the equal protection of the laws and 
applying this Court's prior ruling to the entire class of individuals whose rights are so violated. 
Plaintiffs further seek an injunction compelling defendants to remove plaintiffs and all other 
individuals similarly situated from the sex offender registry and to expunge all records signaling 
their past inclusion on the registry. In the factual allegations framing the plaintiffs' § 1983 Equal 
Protection claim, plaintiffs trace the legislative history of the Crime Against Nature by 
Solicitation statute and accompanying penalties and registration requirement, as well as this 
Court's Order and Reasons and Judgment in Doe I. Plaintiffs also summarize the sex offender 
registration requirements that continue to be imposed upon them as a result of their Crime 
Against Nature by Solicitation convictions.7 Plaintiffs allege that defendants' 6 With a few 
exceptions, these are the same defendants sued in their official capacities that the Doe I plaintiffs 
named. 7 Under the registry law, plaintiffs allege, an individual convicted of Crime Against 
Nature by Solicitation must: (1) provide her or his name, residential, work, and school 
addresses, along with travel routes and proof of residence; (2) provide a current 7 enforcement 
of the registry law as to them has no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest
