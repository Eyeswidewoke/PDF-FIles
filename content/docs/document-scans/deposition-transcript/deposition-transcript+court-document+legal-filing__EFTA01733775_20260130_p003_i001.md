II. 
In the Spring of 2006, reports surfaced internally at the Fund that investor funds had been 
improperly allocated and that certain management fees had been charged to the Fund (as 
well as other funds and managed accounts for which DBZ Partners and DBZCO served as 
the general partner and the investment manager, respectively) before the fees were actually 
payable.. On the advice of the Fund's outside counsel, Schulte, Roth & Zabel, I refrained 
from revealing the details of these errors , while the Fund's outside counsel investigated 
the matter further. Finally, at the end of September 2006, I fired the Chief Financial 
Officer, Mr. Perry Gruss, for these matters, and thereafter, I began to inform investors. 
12. 
After consulting with Dubin,in fact Dubin attended the meeting with counsel, I telephoned 
Epstein at the end of September/beginning of October 2006 about the CFO's termination. 
I told Epstein that the CFO had been terminated over an accounting transaction that was 
"nonmaterial." I specifically advised Epstein that investor money had been mistakenly 
used from the offshore fund to fund on shore liabilities. , but that the money was repaid to 
investors quickly and that the CFO had approved the transaction without my knowledge 
or approval. Epstein immediately demanded a complete withdrawal of FTC's entire 
capital account from the Fund. Epstein was adamant. I was very concerned about 
Epstein's reaction. FTC was a critical investor in the Fund, and I did not want to lose 
FTC as an investor or have other investors follow FTC's lead. I told Epstein that there 
could be a run on the bank. I asked Epstein to refrain from putting that demand in 
writing and was relieved that immediately after the call, Epstein did not put his verbal 
demand in writing. 
13. 
Once I fired the CFO, others in the accounting department came forward with additional 
instances of improper transactions that had taken place. Among those transactions was 
the numerous instances of money advanced to the Fund from the Fund's offshore sister 
fund, D.B. Zwim Special Opportunities Fund, Ltd. (the "Offshore Fund") and other 
investment funds and managed accounts ("Managed Accounts") for which DBZ Partners 
and DBZCO served as the general partner and the investment manager, respectively. In 
response, the Fund decided that it needed to conduct a full independent investigation of 
what had occurred. I made another round of telephone calls to investors in late October 
2006 to advise them of the independent investigation. 
14. 
In light of Epstein's reaction to my initial call, once again I consulted with Dubin about 
how to address these latest developments with Epstein. Dubin advised me to call Epstein, 
and on October 30, 2006, I contacted Epstein a second time to advise him of the 
independent investigation. I again explained to Epstein that I had no prior knowledge of 
the CFO's accounting irregularities. I also reminded Epstein of the continued positive 
performance reported by the Fund and assured him of the Fund's solid financial condition. 
Epstein was very upset and demanded to know why I previously had characterized the 
issues as "nonmaterial" when now an independent review was required. I explained to 
Epstein that I had used the "nonmaterial" language on the advice of the Fund's counsel. 
Epstein demanded that I put him in contact with the Fund's counsel so that Epstein could 
confirm what I had told him. In response, I held a conference call with Epstein and Harry 
Davis, a partner with the Fund's outside counsel. After talking to Mr. Davis, Epstein was 
not satisfied. Epstein again reiterated FTC's demand to withdraw its entire capital
