"I think that it =ould be a historic mistake to ease up on Iran without it dismantling the n=clear capabilities it is 
developing," Netanyahu added when he reached th= Golan. "Iran is now on the ropes, and it is possible to employ 
sanctions at their fullest in order to achieve th= desired result. I hope that the international community will do this, 
and=l call upon it to do so." 
In Geneva, talks co=tinued for a second day on Wednesday. Iran appeared intent on building on =he sense of a fresh 
start that followed the public relations success of ne= Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's U.N. visit, which was capped 
by a telephone conversation with President Ob=ma. The substance of Iran's proposal remained unclear, but European 
dipl=mats, at least, welcomed it for a level of detail not seen in earlier nego=iations. And the tenor of the session 
remained upbeat with the next round of talks now scheduled for early Novem=er. Israelis were surprised when a Iran's 
deputy foreign minister, Abbas=Araghchi, took a question from Israel Radio — a departure for any Irania= official, let 
alone the lead nuclear negotiator in the room at Geneva. 
"Any agreement wi=I open new horizons in relations with all states," Araghchi told the reporter 
<http://www.timesofisrael.comfirans-deputy-fm-to-israel-ra=io-nuke-deal-can-open-new-horizons-with-all-nationsh , 
whose ID clearly identified him as Israeli. The diplomat replied "Yes" when asked if Israel could =ive with any agreement 
that might come out of the Geneva talks. 
"That's the key=question to this negotiation," says Gary Samore, who held the title of P=esident Obama's top adviser on 
weapons of mass destruction for four year=, and now heads a group called United Against Nuclear Iran. "I would put it in 
terms of time. How much time do you wan= to have in terms of advance warning that Iran has decided to pursue 
nucle=r weapons by producing weapons-grade uranium?' 
Currently, a href="http://swampland.time.com/2013/10/14/obamas-ex-top-wmd-official-o=-the-iran-nuclear-talksr 
target="_blank">Samore told reporters in a conference call on Tuesday night, Western intelligence=agencies estimate 
that Iran would need about two months to spin enough ura=ium to the 90% enrichment required for a weapon, if it 
decided to "break=out" of its atoms-for-peace posture. The interval will grow shorter, Samore adds, as Iran brings more 
sophistic=ted centrifuges online. Given that trajectory, he describes the goal of th= negotiations as to "put time back on 
the clock," meaning gain more ti=e for IAEA inspectors to notice and report any move toward the bomb. That time 
would also allow Washington or =srael to prepare air strikes aimed at knocking out Iran's nuclear facili=ies before it's too 
late. 
"Obviously I'd =eel much more comfortable if we had a year's notice, or even nine months=92 notice," Samore says. 
"That would give us a lot more time to detect=and then respond. And I think from Israel's standpoint if there was that 
amount of warning time and the Israelis had confidence t=e U.S. was willing to act once 'breakout' was detected, that 
should gi=e them some comfort as well." 
Israel's leadersh=p has struggled a bit to hit the right note since Rouhani was elected Iran=an President earlier this year. 
The dynamic in the international campaign =o constrain Iran's nuclear ambitions has shifted from scolding rhetoric 
backed by military threat to diplomatic=politesse, with hopes now that a negotiated solution can emerge. At the U.=. 
General Assembly last month, Netanyahu tried to mine Rouhani's profess=onal history in Iran's theocratic regime in an 
effort to hollow out the Iranian's charm offensive. But he =ay have made more headlines for his subsequent interview 
with BBC Persian,=energetically mocked by the Iranians Netanyahu was trying to persuade when=he suggested the hip 
youth of Tehran were not allowed to wear jeans <http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/07/binyam=n-

interview, intent on showing a s=eel that one analyst, at least, says is in fact mostly show. "If Iran an= the Western 
countries agree ... will Israel agree too?" asked Amos Hare= in the daily Haa=etz on Wednesday

officially, is yes." 
That's certainly =ot what Netanyahu has been suggesting relentlessly in public. At the U.N.,=Netanyahu made a show of 
taking the gloves off, offering a more explicit t=reat of military action against Iran's nuclear program — "Israel will stand
