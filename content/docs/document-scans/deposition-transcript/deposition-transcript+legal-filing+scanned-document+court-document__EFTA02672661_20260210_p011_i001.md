Ron Tyson on lead. "Sail Away," produced by a returning Norman Whitfield and featuring Ron Tyson's 
first lead vocal, peaked at number 13. In addition, a then-relatively unknown singer/musician, Ali-011ie 
Woodson was featured on one track, "Stop the World Right Here (I Wanna Get Off)." Woodson was a 
Detroit native who had been a potential candidate to replace Dennis Edwards back in 1977. Meanwhile, 
Edwards (who also had his share of lead vocals on the Back to Basics album) was again fired in 1984, for 
missing rehearsals or showing up hungover. He then attempted a second solo career, scoring a hit with 
the 1984 single "Don't Look Any Further", a duet with Siedah Garrett. At this point, Woodson officially 
joined the group, taking Edwards' place. Woodson's first lead on a single was 1984's "Treat Her Like a 
Lady", co-written by himself and Otis Williams, and co-produced by former Earth, Wind & Fire members 
Al McKay and Ralph Johnson. The single became their biggest success on R&B radio since 1975, reaching 
number-two on the R&B charts, and just missing the Pop Top 40 at number 48. The group experienced 
similar success in 1986 with the single "Lady Soul", another Top 5 R&B smash. 
011ie Woodson remained with the Temptations until 1987, when he was fired for consistent lateness. He 
was replaced by the again-returning Dennis Edwards. The group recorded one album during Edwards's 
third tenure, Together Again, released in late 1987. The following year, Otis Williams published his 
autobiography, Temptations, co-written with Patricia Romanowski, chronicling the careers of the group 
from the Primes/Distants days and focusing on the lives of Williams and Melvin Franklin. (An updated 
version of the book was published in 2002.) 
Edwards was fired from the group for the third and final time in late 1988, with Woodson re-joining the 
lineup. On January 18, 1989, the Temptations were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The 
event honored Edwards, Franklin, Otis Williams, David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks (now performing as 
"Eddie Kendrick"), and, posthumously, Paul Williams. Most of the Temptations, present and former, 
showed no ill feelings towards one another, although Otis Williams reported that Kendricks would not 
speak to him during the ceremony. The Temptations ended their induction ceremony with a 
performance of Paul Williams' signature song, "Don't Look Back", dedicated to his memory. 
After reuniting at the induction ceremony, and much to the chagrin of Otis Williams and Motown, 
Edwards, Ruffin, and Kendrick made plans to tour and record as "Ruffin, Kendricks and Edwards, Former 
Leads of The Temptations". The tour was in fact carried out, but production on the album was canceled 
when 50-year-old David Ruffin died in Philadelphia after a cocaine overdose on June 1, 1991. Kendricks 
was diagnosed with lung cancer soon after; he continued to perform until his death on October 5, 1992 
in his native Birmingham. 
The Temptations in the 1990s 
Richard Street missed a performance in 1992 after undergoing emergency surgery to remove 
kidneystones. Otis Williams, unaware of Street's surgery, called him angrily about his absence. Street 
felt Williams was unsympathetic, and as a result, he left the group in 1993 after twenty-two years. His 
replacement was St. Louis native Theo Peoples.
