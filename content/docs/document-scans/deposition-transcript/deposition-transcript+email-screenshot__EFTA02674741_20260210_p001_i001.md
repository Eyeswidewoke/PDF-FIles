Re: 
Not by my measure. That's why I mention Call of Duty. These are some =f the best selling "first person shooter" games. 
You are running =round blowing shit up. People play them and love them, and have no =dea that everything in the 
game is historically accurate. The =attlefields, weapons, characters, etc. are all meticulously culled from =he historical 
record. Kids play these games and the next thing you =now they are correcting their history teachers in class. The 
important =hing though is that they never compromised on fun, so they became =ommercially successful.

» Im meeting with Joel Klein on monday, any edutainment games that =ou like already out there 
> Play "Medal of Honor" or "Call of Duty" and you will learn war riistory. Here's what I've been thinking. 
> Video games are already great at teaching. If they don't assess your =evel and put an appropriate challenge right in 
front of you, the game =ails. Challenge too hard and you get frustrated and quit playing. Too =asy and the game is no 
fun. That is exactly what a good teacher or =utor would do. Fundamentally the thing that works is a 1 to 1 student 
=eacher ratio. Even if you have a shitty teacher or tutor, you will =earn a lot because that person gets to know you and 
challenges you at =our level. That doesn't scale, but computers do. So we have to use =omputers to replace teachers -
or at least augment them. 
> Today's video games don't try to teach stuff we care about. Well, =xcept for shooting bad guys. The best scheme I've 
come up with so far =s to use X-Prize or something like it to co-opt the existing video game =ndustry. Give out a prize to 
the game that comes up with the best way =f teaching kids anything from a normal school curriculum. Let them =ick 
whatever they want to teach, any grade level, and just incorporate =t into their product. That's the way to get the most 
brains and the =ost users for the least money. You want to skip convincing educators =nd parents about this stuff and 
just go straight for the kids. 
> Imagine you are looking at a door in a video game. It has some =quiggly symbols printed on it. Little munchkins walk 
up to that door =nd say "Konichiwa." The door opens and they are greeted by a hot =rincess with big tits and a thong. 
The door closes in your face. You =re going to fucking learn to read and pronounce Kanji. 
> Unleash that on 5th grade boys and then next thing you know, you'll =ave an entire generation of bilingual kids 
speaking Japanese to each =ther behind the backs of their parents and teachers.
