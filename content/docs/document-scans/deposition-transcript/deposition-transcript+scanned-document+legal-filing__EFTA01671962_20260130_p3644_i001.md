Membership Rewards Claims Resolution 
Effective January 1, 2014, the Arbitration provision in the tens and conditions of the Membership Rewards 
program is replaced with the following: 
CLAIMS RESOLUTION 
Most customer concerns can be resolved by calling our Customer Service Department at the number listed 
on the back of your card. In the event Customer Service is unable to resolve a complaint to your 
satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through mediation, arbitration or litigation. It 
includes an arbitration provision. 
For this section, you and us includes any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or 
entities. Claim means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to your participation in the 
program, these Terms & Conditions or any prior program agreement, except for the validity, enforceability or 
scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to: (1) initial claims, counterclaims, 
crossclaims and third-party claims: (2) claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common 
law and equity: (3) claims by or against any third party using or providing any product, service or benefit in 
connection with the program; and (4) claims that arise from or relate to (a) the program account or any point 
balances on the program account. (b) advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related to 
the program or any reward or (c) the redemption for and use of any reward. You may not sell, assign or 
transfer a claim. 
Sending a Claim Notice 
Before beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and we agree to send a written notice (a claim 
notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the 
claim informally or through mediation. Go to americanexpress.com/claim for a sample claim notice. The 
claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. Notice to you may be provided 
by your billing statement or sent to your billing address. Notice to us must include your name, address and 
Account number and be sent to American Express ADR Go CT Corporation System, 111 8th Ave., NY, NY 
10011. If the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be 
disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules. 
Mediation 
In mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but 
helps parties reach agreement.
