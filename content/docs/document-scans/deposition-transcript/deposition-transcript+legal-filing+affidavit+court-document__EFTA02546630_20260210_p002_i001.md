As you know, the trusts were in Carol's name fo= two reasons: one, we assumed that she would be the survivor, and 
two, for=estate tax reasons, to assure that the three children would receive the ma=imum benefits after we both died. 
In addition, Max has apparently been allowing distributions from the mari=al trust to children and grandchildren without 
consulting me -- and, of co=rse, without calling for investigation of their financial circumstances.=C24, That concern is 
reserved for my request for tax payments from a trus= to which, by rights, I should have full access. 
I can think of only one explanation: Max, as your lawyer, is =eeking to ensure that you receive every penny possible: not 
just the trust= and educational trusts of which you are the sole beneficiaries, along wit= the two houses, and almost all 
of my pension, but even the marital trusts=that M and I established for ourselves. I can think of no other reas=n for his 
radical change of attitude from the time that the IRA was being =xhausted before his eyes to today, with sudden concern 
about long-term pot=ntial problems with the marital trust and possible excessive life expectan=y. No doubt he can 
contrive various legalisms, but I hope it is clea= enough why these should not even be considered in matters such as 
this.4=iv> 
Plainly, this situation -- which I=have only partially described -- is unacceptable. And it would be ev=n apart from what I 
have already written to you, and you know without my s=elling it out. 
To repeat, I've worked =ard all my life and have been very careful to provide for the needs of my =hildren and 
grandchildren, and to ensure that they will be well cared for =fter my death, even abandoning my pension and main 
material possessions (t=e two houses), in addition to trusts of which they are beneficiaries.Q=A0 After M died, I 
assumed that I would spend my last days alone. I =as lucky to meet a wonderful woman, who has given up her life, her 
family,=and her successful professional career to be with me. We are very ha=py together, and have been looking 
forward to a new life in Tucson, in pea=e and tranquillity, where we can be together and pursue our work and lives= I 
think I have that right. Instead, I am spending exorbitant =mounts of time, energy, and even lawyer's fees to obtain 
what should b= available to me with barely a word. Alone among the people I know, = am compelled to suffer serious 
aggravation, and to spend time and energy =way from life and work, without simple financial security. I hope yo= can 
see how unfair this is. 
I would therefore like to renew my request that you inform Max that he s=ould resign. I would then like to replace him 
with my financial advi=er, Richard Kahn, who is experienced, highly qualified, and trustworthy..C240 That seems simple 
enough. 
Fur=hermore, it is urgent. Within the next few days, money has to be ava=lable for taxes, and Max's repeated delays 
and sudden scruples are goi=g to again cost a lot of money that I should not have to spend. I ho=e it is also clear that I 
should not have be facing this kind of situation=at this stage of my life.
