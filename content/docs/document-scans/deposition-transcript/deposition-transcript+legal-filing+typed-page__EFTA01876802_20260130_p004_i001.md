The universal banking debate will take another serious twist if the new leadership of 
Barclays ultimately decides to break the bank up into a retail bank and an investment 
bank and broker/dealer. As extreme as this sounds, the intangible costs in political and 
regulatory animus Barclays now attracts could suggest that a clean break makes sense. 
An arrangement that gave existing shareholders a stake in both new institutions might 
be acceptable. 
Barclays would no doubt sell such a split as a smart commercial move. But the political 
and regulatory subtext would be to undermine the case that such banking 
agglomerations are both necessary and useful. Although the French and German 
commitment to their own universal banking systems is very strong, such a split would 
certainly empower critics of the universal banking model in the EU and the US. The 
Liikanen Group inquiry is due to report to the European Commission on bank structure 
later this year. The Commission itself is then expected to issue its own 
recommendations on bank structure. Both will certainly draw on the Barclays 
experience. 
The culture question 
This bigger issue about the values of the trading floor is going to prove hard to shake 
off. The role of securities divisions in driving investment bank profits over the last two 
decades has predictably seen a generation of securities managers rise to the 
leadership of investment and universal banks. While it is perhaps unwise to generalise 
too much, most of these men have brought with them the directness and self-belief 
that comes with surviving a career on the trading floor. 
They also bring with them a view of the market and of market-making that is often at 
odds with the way most politicians understand them. Watching Lloyd Blankfein of 
Goldman Sachs trying to explain to the US Senate in 2010 why it was legitimate for 
Goldman Sachs as a market maker to be both long and short in the US property 
market at the same time reinforced the point. There is a yawning gulf between a 
trader's pragmatic view of financial markets and a wider political and public audience 
who generally interpret the market maker's pragmatism as cynicism, detachment and 
short termism, especially when it results in making a lot of money. 
Banks tend to be highly impatient with this public and political ambivalence. Most 
banks' response to efforts at greater regulation of securities markets have often been 
rooted in the argument that these markets are fundamentally a forum for free trade 
between consenting adults and should be treated as such. It is this argument that the 
LIBOR-scandal, with its taint of market fixing, and the persistent flow of suggestions of 
contempt for customers and clients, does so much to undermine. 
The events of the last two months have succeeded in cementing for good the idea that 
the banking crisis of 2008 was ultimately the result of unethical, 'casino' behaviour on 
the trading floor. Whatever failings banks might have exhibited in their ethical 
standards here, the reality is that the banking crisis had its roots in poor lending and 
risk standards, and poor management of loan book funding, rather than wild gambles 
or duplicity in the securities markets. The Vickers Commission explicitly recognised 
this by focusing on raising capital standards at the retail banks that make up the 
backbone of the British credit system. 
Recent huge losses in the Chief Investment Office atl P Morgan and conduct like that 
of Barclays' traders have made this distinction far too subtle to insist upon politically. 
This may not matter much in regulatory terms — regulators have already embarked on
