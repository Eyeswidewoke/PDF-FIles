There will be no liquidator appointed and it is therefore essential that the directors/LLP members are able to identify all 
the assets and liabilities of the LLP, Topco and Midco. 
There will be no need to wait for an entity to be dissolved before the next step can be taken. It should therefore be 
possible to complete the steps fairly quickly. 
We hold the register of members for the LLP and this has not been updated to reflect Phaidon Global LLC and JMWT 
Manager LLC becoming members of the LLP and PLB LLC and JMWT LLC ceasing to be members, as we were not aware 
of the transfer of partnership interests. We have also checked the public registers and note that the public registers do 
not reflect the change in the membership of the LIP. As an initial step, it will therefore be necessary to pass ratification 
resolutions of the LLP members to confirm the membership of the LIP and update the registers accordingly. If Phaidon 
Global LLC and JMWT Manager LLC can be included as members from now (rather than ratifying historic membership), 
this will be a much easier (and preferable) process. Have Phaidon Global LLC and JMWT Manager LLC taken any action as 
members of the LLP to date? 
We have based the steps on the following assumptions: 
" 
the LLP, Topco and Midco have no liabilities (they have given no guarantees, entered into no contracts, there are 
no loan arrangements in place (intra-group or otherwise) and they have no creditors); 
* 
the share capital of Topco exceeds the value of the Midco shares by at least £1 (this will enable us to reduce the 
capital of Topco, leaving £1 of capital to create sufficient distributable profits to enable the shares of Midco to be 
transferred to the LLCs as a dividend in specie); 
the share capital of Midco exceeds the value of the JMWT shares by at least £1; 
the LLP, Topco and Midco have no assets other than the shares of Topco, Midco and JMWT (respectively); 
• 
accounts/balance sheets of Topco and Midco will be provided to show the assets and liabilities of Topco and Midco 
before each company reduces its share capital, and also an updated balance sheet will be provided following completion 
of the capital reduction. It is possible to just have accounts/balance sheets for the position following the capital 
reduction, but as the directors will have personal liability for the solvency statements they make in connection with the 
capital reduction, it is preferable for them to have accounts/balance sheets to refer to at the time the solvency 
statements are made; 
• 
accounts/a balance sheet will be provided for the LLP to show the assets and liabilities of the LLP at the time of the 
distribution of assets to the members; 
` 
the LLP Agreement dated 3 October 2012 was signed; 
* 
JMWT Manager LLC entered into a deed of adherence to the LLP Agreement (we have seen the deed of adherence 
signed by Phaidon Global LLC); and
