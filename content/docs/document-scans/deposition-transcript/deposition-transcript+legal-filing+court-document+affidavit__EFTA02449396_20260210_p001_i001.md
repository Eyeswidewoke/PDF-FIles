Jeffrey I think you hate me... I have=the impression you are trying to cut me out of your life. You tell me you 
=re sick but then you spend the day with Wandy or I don't know who. It&=39;s been almost a week you are in Paris and 
you didn Ht even tell me you were coming. The fact that you are in Europe and you d=n't want to see me makes me 
believe that I'm not so important for =ou since it's more than 6months that we don't see each other.=. I would prefer for 
you to be honest with me instead of making up excuses= same as when I wanted to come to NY. I know you have a 
girlfriend and you=don't want her to know about me but I don't understand why, since =e are not together or even 
seeing each other. I thought we were friends.... 
I'm a 1O0% grateful everyday for what I have and wha= you give me, thank you. I don't know how I would make 
it without=you and your support... What I know is that I will always defend=you regardless of what people say and will 
always be by your side if you h=ve any problem. I really have a lot of respect and affection for you this =s why seeing this 
whole situation and the way you are distancing yourself =rom me makes me extremely sad... 
Today, I found a job desp=te the fact that I know that none of your girls in NY is working. I know y=u are trying to 
help me (thank you) but I don't understand this c=ntradiction. I hope that one day I will be able to make my way throug= 
life. I'm sure I have a lot of defects and I understand I have to gro= and that I have a lot to learn about how things really 
work but I do='t see myself as horrible as you say I am. 
Maybe you wi=l not like this message and will take it as a whining but contrary I =elieve that venting my pain is 
healthier than suppress it with drugs. I pr=fer to be honest and clear with you instead of pretending of being ok=when 
I'm not. By writing you this message I'm leaving aside my pri=e since I believe a relationship with no communication is 
fake and I don&#=9;t want to be fake with you. 
Love=you...
