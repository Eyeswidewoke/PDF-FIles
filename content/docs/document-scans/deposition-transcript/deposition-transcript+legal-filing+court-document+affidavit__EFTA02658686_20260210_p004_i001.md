would not submit to this procedure. Since your eff=rts and proposals simply repeat the same procedure, they were a 
waste of t=me. 
There were some things in your letter that were correct= You're right that 
despite what has happened, I'm still a &q=ot;wealthy man," with income well above the median, though lacking a 
=ension and accumulated property, not at the level of my peers. Furth=rmore, I can supplement my income by teaching 
large undergraduate courses,=something I'd never done and that is not that common for people approa=hing 90, but 
something that I enjoy. And you too are a wealthy man, =or the same reasons: the reasons are that I've worked hard all 
my life= lived fairly simply (and live even more simply today), and was therefore =ble to put aside enough money to 
ensure that my children and grandchildren=are very well cared for, indefinitely. 
But I ag=in suggest that we put all of this aside, and deal quickly and simply 
with=what appears to be the one outstanding issue: dividing the Marital trust a=d then dissolving it, all very simple, 
needing no lawyers, at least on my =art.

Perhaps, as = next step, you could ask your lawyer to contact mine and begin a discussi=n in which we all participate. 
I'm also curio=s to hear your thoughts about the proposals I suggested in my

As I wrote a little while ago, I did write a long response t= your last -- deeply

But now I'm writing ju=t about one point, which seems to be the core of the 
problem -- a problem,=which, again, I don't understand. But let's put that aside, =hough I hope we can clear it up soon. 
All of this is a painful=cloud that I never would have imagined would darken my late years. 
The core issue seems to be the marital trust. I'=ve explained how M and I 
actually set it up with Eric, which seemed to us =ust plain common sense. I've also explained Max's different 
=nterpretation. I've asked you for yours, but haven't heard i=. But let's put that aside too, and just resolve the matter, 
as =an be done very simply -- with no need for lawyers to explain the fiduciar= responsibility of the trustee I appointed 
years ago to replace me, someth=ng I never paid any attention to before. 
The simp=e solution is to divide the trust into two parts. One part will go t= you, 
to use as you wish. One part will go to me, for me to use with=ut any investigations of my financial situation and other 
such intrusions =hat I won't accept. Then the trust can simply be dissolved, and =t is all over.
