1/First - we had always agreed once the project started to be delayed=along with AP not being funded a new 
$800k budget was needed for the resta=rant-this budget was based from the day of funding - and with a September 
=pening — which so far neither obviously has happened 
for the record we never =quot; agreed " , since march we knew the restaurant would=not open in sept. but 
you staffed up anyway, the restaur=nt is over budget by a signifigant amount already. as a result=of your decisions. 
not " ours " 
we both had agreed to personally fund the restaurant with $200k each =this was back before summer when we 
thought we would open in late August.=C24) 
that was to make up a shortfall which I had to do on m= own.? 
Then in September when you where relaying on Arcade to fund a bridge =oan - and we needed funds to 
complete time and weather sensitive construct=on items - ie the new roof, sidewalk and other items -which I funded -
we =oth agreed to fund construction with $200k and where to be repaid when Arcade funded - it was never =rcades 
intention to fund our loans. . we discussed thisc=r> 
-Arcade walked away from the loan and we where never reimbursed =. of course not 
-Then when Crescendo stepped in to advance you the 3.5mm loan -you ad=ised them that $750k was going to 
the restaurant - this is not correct- wh= you positioned the proceeds this way is not accurate. 
I have yet to u=derstand why 750 k is needed , and of course not immediately. =C240 you have not provided 
cash flow statement to the partnership so we c=n now ssee its benefit if any 
We both need to be reimbursed from the Crescendo hotel loan -my loan =s higher then $200k at this point - but 
reimburse each of us so we can the= personally fund the restaurant- as we agreed upon 
So the hotels additional funding of the restaurant is $350 k not $750= cannot be done our load are not senior 
at all 
c/=pan> 
2/ Still to be addressed - which you have not responded to - is an ou=line as to the possible shortfall in the 
restaurant we could endure from J=nuary to April - complete budget sent to you weeks ago. 
it it incomplete 
3/ I'm told you only are funding the restaurant $700 k becaus= you subtracted last weeks PR ? This is not correct 
in addition there are =P items that are not the restaurant responsibility -ie tasting for bankers=and loan people - the 
charity event on Monday to promote the hotel - we can address this at tomorrows meeting 
=/span> 
we can also address how your lawyer held up t=e entire partnership for a 25k payment otherwise he would not 
provide sign=tures. . this is wrong in many regards. I never ag=eed to pay your lawyer , nor would I . 
4/ AP - how these accounts are paid off- following the AP list you ad=ised lenders would be cured - you need to 
complete before they lean the ho=el- as a few have threatened. 
= am aware
