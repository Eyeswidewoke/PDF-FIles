These patients were overwhe=mingly male, and most of them were admitted to large, urban teaching hospitals. About 
43% of the victims=were treated in the South, where the proportion of uninsured patients was highest. And national=y, 
30% of gunshot victims treated in hospitals during the study period were insured by Medicaid. "Firearm-related injuries 
place a particular burden on governmental payers and the poor,Q=80+ the study authors wrote. In addition to the 
29% of patients nationwide who were insured by Medicaid, which largely serv=s low-income and disabled Americans, 
more than 4 out of 5 of the uninsured patients "fell below the 50th income percentile." 
This group is unlikely to b= able to pay their medical bills, and so these costs are often written off as losses to the 
hospitals that provide the care. The cost of keeping those hospitals open, in turn, is typically borne by taxpayers in the 
form =f local tax levies or block grants to the states. Until now, the most recent estimate of the cost of firearm injuries 
extended only through 1997 and used hospital data from only two states...AO That's very likely because in 1996, gun 
rights advocates on Capitol Hill began forbidding the use of federal funds "to advocate or promote gun control" and 
federal funds to conduct r=search on firearms injuries virtually dried up. While the Obama administration last year 
proposed a welter of initiatives to redu=e gun injuries, few are likely to be funded by a GOP-led Congress.

Without a doubt, gun violen=e is a public health crisis — as last year gun violence took the lives of almost 33,000 
Americans. Another =5,000 Americans sustained injuries from guns, many of them life-shattering. The price tag for gun 
violen=e was $229 billion last year for health care, law enforcement, insurance, employment a=d other costs. While 
mass shootings like Sandy Hook Elementary School, Orlando, Virginia Tech and Fort Hood shake th= national 
consciousness and give rise to calls for gun reform measures, most deaths and injuries from gun violence involve fewer 
than four victims.40=AO It happens in our homes, on street corners, at work and at play. 
Gun violence occurs more fr=quently in the United States than in almost any other nation. A study published in the 
American Journal of Medicine found that the gun homicide r=te in the U.S. is 25 times (t=at is 2500 percent) higher than 
in other high income countries. Un=ntentional firearm deaths in the U.S. are 6.2 times higher. Perhaps most surprising is 
that about 60 percent of all firearm deaths in the U.S. are suicides, with the use of firearms highest a=ong white males. 
Analysis, based on data provided by the Centers for Disease Control for 2015, found that more than =ne million years of 
life are lost each year to gun violence, assuming that the victim would otherwise live to age 75. This makes firearm 
violence a leading cause of foreshortened life, behind only cancer, heart disease and unintentional injury. 
The thought that our legisl=tors refuse to enact commonsense gun reforms, such as more comprehensive background 
checks for gun purchases=and denial to any persons who have been convicted of domestic violence and thos= suffering 
from mental illness. Given the current political landscape, it is unlikely that additional gun control measures will be 
adopted in Washington. In fact, the opposite may occ=r. The new Congress just voted to repeal the Social Security 
disability gun rule. This rule limits access to guns =or individuals with mental disabilities who are unable to manage their 
day-to-=ay affairs. According to the Washington Post, the rule would have prevented ab=ut 75,000 individuals with 
mental health issues from purchasing firearms.
