Your reaction, to my amazement, was to refuse, even und=r these remarkable circumstances, by 
imposing4e=A0absurd conditions that no one with a shred of dignity could accept, no c=ncern of yours. Of course, no 
such questions ever were on even the remote =orizon when I was trustee, before choosing you to replace me, or on any 
ot=er occasion when I arranged for funds to go to you, either as an ample inh=ritance or for regular expenses. 
Your letter now mak=s your reasoning very clear. Your proposal is that you should remain=in total control, 
evidently a matter of great importance for you. An= following your principles, as exhibited with crystal clarity under 
even t=e extreme circumstances just described, you can ensure that the funds in t=eir entirety will go to you, though I 
suppose in your kindness you might r=lax your strict regimen slightly when the day comes, as it must, when I am=no 
longer in a position to retain a shred of dignity and to refuse an intr=sive and humiliating interrogation. 
However, there is a si=pler way to realize your objectives, even more fully. You can resign=as trustee -- of 
course possible, just as I did when I appointed you.Q=A0 We can then agree that you receive the entire funds right now, 
instead =f waiting until I die, so that you can use them right now for whatever pur=oses you like. Plainly that's more 
efficient, and even more lucr=tive for you than your suggestion. 
It's true that this=is one possible proposal, as you suggest. 
Another proposal=is the one I suggested. True, there are some arcane tax issues, but =hese can easily be 
resolved, as your lawyer can explain to you, with commo= consent among the beneficiaries -- which means your 
consent. 
=div> 
There are, of course, other possibilities. I could pursue legal m=asures to have the trust used in the manner in 
which it was intended.4>=A0 I could also look into the disbursements that have been made to family =embers (so I have 
learned) without informing me, and could look into why l=haven't been receiving any income from the trust for years 
(until I fi=ally raised the question), and why investments were made the way they were=done, yielding long-term returns 
that would be of no use for me, highly ir=egular for an elderly person -- which, as I wrote you, greatly surprised f=nancial 
advisers I consulted when I finally began to pay attention. =nd, furthermore, why I never received any statements about 
what was going =n for years, until I finally asked what is going on with the trust. =nd perhaps other matters that 
evidently concern you, as shown by your requ=st for protection for past actions. But I haven't ye= shifted to your 
domain and still retain some illusions about family relat=ons. 
There are other matters that l&=39;ve written to you about several times, with no response, which means I 
=resume that you do not want to hear them. They don't specificall= have to do with this matter, so if you have gotten 
this far in the letter= you can stop here. But they are on my mind, and I want to clear the=air -- if anyone wishes to look. 
My father could =ie in peace, knowing his children would ensure that his wife would be take= care of. I don't 
have that luxury. 
No lawyers or words were necessary.40=A0 It was simply obvious that we would hand over to her what there 
was of =n inheritance, the house and everything in it. And of course we were=very pleased that he had joy and 
companionship in his last years.
