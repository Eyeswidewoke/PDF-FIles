FBI Daily News Briefing 
An opinion piece from The Hill (06/02, Tiahrt) reported that China's state-owned enterprise, Pangang Group, 
admitted to state-sponsored industrial espionage in a U.S. court, highlighting the country's role in using commercial 
enterprises for geopolitical gain. According to the article, third-party litigation funding, which allows outside 
financiers to fund lawsuits in exchange for a cut of potential winnings, poses a national security risk as it can be 
used by foreign entities to drain resources from U.S. companies and gain access to proprietary information. The 
article noted that proposed federal laws, such as the Protecting Our Courts from Foreign Manipulation Act and the 
Litigation Funding Transparency Act, introduced by Rep. Ben Cline and Rep. Darrell Issa, respectively, aim to 
address this issue by requiring transparency and prohibiting foreign governments from investing in third-party 
litigation funding. The article highlighted that the FBI has called China's economic espionage the "greatest long-
term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property, and to our economic vitality." The author stated 
that "we lack even the most basic safeguards to ensure that our courtrooms aren't being used as intelligence-
gathering venues for hostile foreign powers. That is unacceptable."

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
FBI Asking for Pictures, Videos, Information From North Carolina Mass Shooting 
WBTV (CBS-3) (06/02, Tucker) reported that the FBI is asking the community for any pictures, videos or information 
from this weekend's mass shooting in Catawba County. Shots rang out around 12:45 a.m. on Sunday, June 1 at a 
house party on Walnut Acres Drive in the Mountain View area, which is just south of Hickory. According to the 
article, the Catawba County Sheriff's Office said 12 people were shot or hurt in other ways, including one man who 
died. The victims ranged from 16 to 58 years old. The 58-year-old, Shawn Patrick Hood, died. Investigators said at 
least 80 shots were fired during the melee, and the crime scene spanned about two acres. As of Sunday evening, 
the sheriff's office, FBI and state investigators were still working to determine a motive for the violence. WSOC 
(ABC-9) (06/02, Faherty), Queen City News (06/02, Jennes, Bowyer, et al.), and Newsweek (06/02, Stanton) also 
reported on the story. 
Law Enforcement Looking Into Instagram Posts Linked to Louisiana Escapee 
WWL (CBS-4) (06/02, Staff Writer) reported that eighteen days after one of the largest jail escapes in New Orleans 
history, authorities are still searching for two men, and the cost of that manhunt continues to climb. According to 
the article, of the 10 inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in the early hours of May 16, eight have 
been captured and 16 others have been arrested for allegedly helping them flee or hide. Several of those accused 
accomplices, however, are now out on bond, even as the multi-agency search continues for Antoine Massey and 
Derrick Groves, the two remaining fugitives. Authorities are actively investigating videos circulating on Instagram 
that allegedly feature Antoine Massey. However, the authenticity of these videos has not been confirmed. Federal 
sources confirm investigators were made aware of the Massey post late Monday afternoon. The article mentioned 
that in the video, the man says he is "one of the ones that was let out of OJC." He also sought help from rappers 
Meek Mill, Lil Wayne, and NBA YoungBoy, as well as President Donald Trump. At one point, the man says, "Who I 
was in the past is not who I am today," while denying allegations that he threatened a maintenance worker with a 
weapon and called the jail system "corrupted" and referencing both OJC and St. Tammany Parish jails. He also 
displays what he claims are affidavits, stating, "This is the affidavits on a date right here." Authorities have not 
confirmed whether the video was recorded after the escape or if the person in the video is indeed Massey. 
Nola.com (06/02, Cartolano), WVUE (Fox-8) (06/02, Killett), CNN (06/02, Boyette, Yan), and USA TODAY (06/02, 
Robledo) also reported on the story. 
North Carolina Deputies, FBI Conduct New Searches in Decade-Old Missing Person's Case 
WMBF (NBC-32) (06/02, Staff Writer) reported that in the continued effort to find a Fairmont woman who 
disappeared 10 years ago, the Robeson County Sheriff's Office continues to search for Sara Graham. RCSO 
confirmed deputies and the FBI conducted multiple searches across the county on Monday in an ongoing effort to 
find Graham, who disappeared on Feb. 4, 2015. According to the article, authorities left early on the morning of 
Feb. 4, 2015, to go to work at Walmart but she never made it there. Hours later, her van was found abandoned in a 
field along East McDonald Road. The FBI and Robeson County Sheriff's Office have followed hundreds of leads and 
interviewed dozens of people, but none have led them to Graham's whereabouts. "We are not giving up on finding 
and seeking justice for Sara," said Sheriff Burnis Wilkins. "Homicide Detectives, along with FBI Agents, are 
continuing to investigate and are following up on every new lead they receive. Someone has yet to come forward,
