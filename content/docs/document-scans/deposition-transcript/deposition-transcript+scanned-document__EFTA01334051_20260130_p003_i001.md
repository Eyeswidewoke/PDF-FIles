One power player who doesn't find Epstein to be all that hard to figure is Donald Trump. 
"I've known Jeffrey for 15 years." The Donald tells the magazine. "Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is 
even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side." 
Another thing Epstein - who's said to pocket at least $75 million a year in fees - and Trump have in common is a 
taste for extravagant living. Epstein lives in a 45,000-square-foot, eight-story mansion on East 71st Street. 
Leslie Wexner, founder and chair of the Limited clothing-store chain, bought the place in 1989 for $15,000. 
Epstein's mentor and one of his clients. Wexner is rumored to have sold the palatial digs to him for just $1. 
Epstein quickly spent 510 million to gut the place and completely redo the interior. 
"I don't want to live in another person's house," Epstein told New York.
Blind dater 
CHRIS Noth wasn't lonely on a recent trip to London. The "Law & Order" hunk was set up on a blind date with 
Rose Keegan, an actress and the daughter of historian Sir John Keegan. The two spent much of the evening at 
the Century Club, and they were chaperoned by Kyle MacLachlan, who is pals with Noth from their days on the 
set of "Sex and the City." MacLachlan is in London co-starring in a play with hemp-happy Woody Harrelson. 
'Rockets' soars 
"ROCKETS Redglare!" - a posthumous tribute to the late East Village actor and downtown icon - won the Grand 
Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. Directed by 
Luis Fernandez De La Reguera, it features interviews with Rockets' pals Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Jim 
Jamiusch, Steve Buscemi and Julian Schnabel. Rockets, the beloved 350-pound former bodyguard of punk 
legend Sid Vicious who appeared in several of Buscemi's and Jarmusch's movies, died last year after years of 
drug abuse. 
Bizarre union 
BOB Crane was a sex addict, but his second wife, Pat Crane, didn't care. "He treated women like the rest of the 
world treats toilet paper. Who's going to be jealous of toilet paper?" she told "20/20" contributing correspondent 
Chris Connelly. Despite Crane's penchant for seducing other women and documenting his trysts on film and 
videotape, Pat insists: "We had a wonderful sex life. We had a wonderful marriage." Crane was bludgeoned to 
death in 1978 with a camera tripod. 
Plot device 
GAY writers love PAGE SIX. Everyone's favorite gossip column is prominently featured in the new novel "The 
Night We Met," a romantically swishy comedy by Rob Byrnes about a guy and his mafioso boyfriend. After 
making references to this page and The Post throughout the book, Byrnes even attempts to replicate one of our 
items in the climax. Byrnes' fictional item may lack the flawless prose of a real PAGE SIX scoop, but he does 
have us outsmarting yet another mendacious mouthpiece. 
Change partners 
SOCIALITE Samantha Boardman ditched her beau, Conde Nast editorial director James Truman, last year for 
man-about-town Todd Meister. According to our spies, Boardman ditched Meister after she caught him in 
flagrante with a 19-year-old coed. But don't feel too bad for her. Women's Wear Daily reports Boardman has a 
new man - Vanity Fairs Graydon Carter. Truman must not be too pleased. When Boardman dumped him, he 
needed to recuperate at a Buddhist retreat upstate. Editorial meetings at Conde Nast must be a hoot these 
days.
