Subject: Question re Epstein 
Hi Nand El 
I wanted to give you something to think about before our 2:00 conference call. 
and I have been doing some digging into the
 situation and have found out some really disturbing 
info. It appears that, since Day I, Goldberger and 
(the State Attorney) have been scheming to get Epstein 
out on work release. For example, the indictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would have 
made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged correctly. (Remember that 
also went along 
with letting us believe that Epstein was pleading twistrable offense when Epstein's folks and 
believed that he the offense was not registrable.) 
and Goldberger also told us that Epstein would be 
housed at the Palm Bch Cty Jail, not the Stockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at the 
jail. Judge McSorley has a standing order that allows PBSO to grant work release to any defendant she has 
sentenced who is housed at the Stockade. Judge Pucillo (the actual sentencing judge) does not have that order. 
So Goldberger prepared the "nunc pro tunc" order, including the language that we had specifically rejected, to 
Judge McSorley for her signature. Obviously the State Attorney's Office had notice of the order but no one ever 
told us and they had a copy of the Non-Prosecution Agreement which contains clear language that the Nunc Pro 
Tune would violate the Agreement. 
As part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's deputies to provide him with "protection." It 
appears that he is paying between $3000 and $4100 per week for this service, despite the work release rules 
barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and the Sheriff's Office itself) from having "any business transactions 
with inmates or their families while they are in the custody or supervision of the Sheriff and for at least one (I) 
calendar year after termination of their sentence." Epstein's work release application materials state that he is 
being paid $250,000 per year. While in the stockade, his salary is paid into the PBSO's trust fund where it can 
be used to pay Epstein's room and board and travel expenses or other legal obligations. If Epstein "escapes," 
PBSO can forfeit all wages in the trust fund. 
and I are of the opinion that we should not budge on the 24-hour-a-day incarceration. If they balk, we 
should point out to them all of the things that we have let go in our efforts to make this agreement work. For 
example, not pointing out the misstatements made by Goldberger and Epstein at sentencing; the presentation of 
incorrect guideline computations to Judge Pucillo at sentencing; the placement at the stockade instead of at the 
jail; etc. We can even swallow the nunc pro tunc so long as he stays in jail. 
I think that someone should raise Goldberger's continued misrepresentations to us and to others. Even in this 
instance, he has continued using threats, manipulation, and misstatements to get what Epstein wants. He told 
PBSO that we knew about the work release (so PBSO didn't need to contact us and ask for our position) and that 
we had no objection to it. When PBSO objected to putting Epstein on work release, Goldberger threatened to
