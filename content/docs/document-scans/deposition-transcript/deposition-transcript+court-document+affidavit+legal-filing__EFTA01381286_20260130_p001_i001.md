Table of Contrail 
9 percentage points of the increase in net sales and favorable product mix contributed 2 percentage points, partially offset by a 1 percentage point 
impact from net pricing. In preparation for the systems cutover from our previous ERP system to SAP, we stopped shipping to customers in 
December 2013 for a partial week. These sales were =ovend in the first quarter of 2014 when we resumed shipping to customers. As a result, we 
estimate that $13.1 million of sales were shifted from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014. Excluding this shift in shipments, our 
net sales growth for the three months ended March 31, 2015 would have been 6.8 percentage points higher, or 16.8%.

$187.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014. Volume growth accounted for 9 percentage points of the increase in net sales of Dry 
Foods and favorable product mix contributed 1 percentage point, partially offset by a 1 percentage point impact from net pricing. The introduction 
of new products under each of our major product lines drove our growth in net sales of Dry Foods. The decrease in net pricing was primarily driven 
by higher levels of promotional activity.

31. 2015. compared to $39.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014. Volume growth accounted for 8 percentage points of the increase 
in net sales of our Wet Foods, Treats and Other Products and favorable product mix contributed 7 percentage points, partially offset by a 1 
percentage point impact from net pricing. The introduction of new wet foods across each of our major product lines was the primary' driver of the 
growth of our net sales of Wet Foods, Treats and Other Products. The decrease in net pricing was primarily driven by higher levels of promotional 
activity.

the three months ended March 31. 2014. driven primarily by increased volume. Gross margin decreased to 40.0% for the three months ended 
March 31, 2015, from 42.6% for the three months ended March 31. 2014 and was primarily impacted by incremental supply chain costs (1.1
