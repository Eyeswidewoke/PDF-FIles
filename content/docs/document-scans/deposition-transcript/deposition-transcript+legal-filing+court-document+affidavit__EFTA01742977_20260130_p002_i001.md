Cap II (381427AA1) @ 72.50 (- 5.5% Current Yield).They recently tendered $600MM at $75.00. We believe there is a 
chance that they come back and tender for more at $75-$77. When a bank is able to redeem pfds at a discount, that 
discount accrues to their Income Statement. There remains $1.2 BLN outstanding - so they could issue another pfd to 
pay for the remaining $1.2BIn and book another $300MM to income. Paul
