poem will be the poem of fact in the language of fact. But it will be the poem of fact not realized beforelt" 
Facts smirk. 
Waste time: the thing world, the people world. Waste time: the trivia of daily life: the forms which command attention, 
respect. Waste time: the belief that idealization is above performance. Waste time: aceRidiculous the waste sad time / 
Stretching before and after.fi96 Waste time: ficeHill, cloud, field, wall . . . / All that we touch, see, think . . . / Unliven all: the 
stone, the dust / The Earth itself and man and Man / Turn thing / And must.a97 The incredible something of nothing. 
No differentiation: ficeAnybody can be interested in what anybody does but does that make any difference, is it all important. 
Anybody can be interested in what anybody says, but does that make any difference, is it at all important.1" 
ficeForget, forget . . . Forget what you forget. / The diary entry: name, fact, place, and date / Let go and let the loitering dead 
be dead.r Universe is finite: obligatory, devoid of indecision, determinate. ficeWill, doubt, desire, thought . . . / All in us: / 
Faith, Hope, Love . . . / Naught but THINGS itself away / And you, and I, as meant, obey: / Are nounaTMd / To naught.fil® 
The incredible something of nothing. ficeStill missing it though: / Though what, none know.fiild 
No accretion: no hierarchical order. ficeThere cannot be a hierarchy of the forms of elementary propositions. We can foresee 
only what we ourselves constructlim Praise-blame: no hierarchical judgment. You are not to blame: what does this do to 
this. People do not help people: what does this do for this. No accretion: no hierarchical order. There cannot be a higher 
intelligence whether alien, technological, etc., for ficewhat cannot be expressed we do not express,fim what cannot be known 
we do not know. Judgment is impossible. No hierarchical order: Nature is never more complicated than we imagine it. 
Numbers donaTMt count. ficeA multiplicity merely enters into the process through its individual members.am Counting: 
comparison: one for a; two for b; There is no comparison. No accretion: no hierarchies. The description is the thing. No 
multiplicities: keit is the chord that falsifies.fil95 Numbers donlimt count. aceA man and a woman / Are one. / A man and a 
woman and a blackbird / Are one.fim Numbers donaTMt count. No one: unitless unity. Not a number, but a commission. Not 
a word and yet another kind of word. 
Living with the growing terror of nothing to think about. ficeNot a persistent thing with varying states but a system of 
interrelated events. The old solidarity is gone, and with it the characteristics that, to the materialist, made matter seem more 
real than fleeting thoughts:al" The incredible something of nothing. ficeMatter of solid objects and hard particles has no 
existence in reality and only appears to exist through our observing nonmaterial things in a confused wayrthrough the bias of 
human spectacles.a10" 
ficeNo language can be anything but elliptical, requiring a leap of the imagination to understand its meaning in its relevance to 
immediate experience:it" Take the available language with its ambiguities and use it. The language is completely clastic. 
Anything can be said. Welcome the confusion: welcome the contradictions. Knowledge, wisdom, are a dead end. You cane 
Tmt know any more than you do know. Ask the fool.
