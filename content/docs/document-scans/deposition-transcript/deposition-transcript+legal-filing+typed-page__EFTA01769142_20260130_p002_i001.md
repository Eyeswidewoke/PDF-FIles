To paraphrase =the late U.S. House Speaker Tip O'Neill, in the Islamic Republic of Iran al= politics may not be 
sexual, but all sex is political. Exhibit A is the rev=lution's father, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Like all Shiite 
cler=cs aspiring to become a "source of emulation" (marja'-e taglid), Khomeini spent t=e first part of his career 
meticulously examining and dispensing religious g=idance on personal behavior and ritual purity that ranged from the 
mundane (=It is recommended not to hold back the need to urinate or defecate, especia=ly if it hurts") to the 
surprisingly lewd. 
Scholars o= Shiism -- including harsh critics of Khomeini -- emphasize that such theme= were the norm among 
clerics of Khomeini's generation and should be underst=od in their proper context: Islam was a religion that emerged 
out of a rura= desert, and the Prophet Mohammed was himself once a shepherd. Whereas reli=ions like Christianity and 
Judaism simply declare such behavior to be sinfu=, Islam addresses them from a juridical point of view. 
Th= underlying problem, says Islamic scholar Mehdi Khalaji, a former seminary s=udent in the Shiite epicenter of 
Qom, is not that such issues were addresse=, but the fact that "Islamic jurisprudence hasn't yet been modernized. 
It's=totally disconnected from the issues that modern, urban people have to deal=with." 
Indeed= Khomeini's religious prescriptions are often the butt of jokes among Iran'= post-revolutionary 
generations. "I've never even seen a camel in Tehran," p=ominent Iranian cartoonist Nikahang Kowsar told me, "let 
alone been tempted=to have sex with one." 
sexy <http://www.=oogle.com/trends/?q=sexy&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&so=t=0> " is even more popular 
among Arab=.) Google Insights, another trend spotter, shows that the most rapidly risi=g search term for Iranians so far 
in 2012 has been "Golshifteh Farahani," a=popular exiled actress who in January posed topless for the French 
magazine=nbsp;Madame Fig=ro. 
Before the 1979 r=volution, religious fundamentalists were revolted by images of scantily cla= Iranian women in 
the country's cinema and television; today, state televis=on and cinema are forbidden from showing unveiled Iranian 
women. This is de=pite the fact that most of the country's citizens have access to the much m=re tawdry fare on satellite 
TV (the dishes are officially illegal, but thou=ht to be smuggled in by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps itself). In t=e 
forthcoming documentary The Iran Job <http://www.kickstarter.com/projec=s/554272471/the-iran-job> New Yorker 
several years ago, a= Iranian security official candidly asses=ed the challenge 
<http://www.newyorker.com/archive=2005/11/21/051121fa_fact4?currentPage=all> at hand: 
=/o:p> 
The majority of the population is young.... Young people=by nature are horny. Because they are horny, they like 
to watch satellite c=annels where there are films or programs they can jerk off to.... We h=ve to do something about 
satellite television to keep society free from thi= horny jerk-off situation. 
One might assume a country tha= suffers from chronic inflation and unemployment -- not to mention harsh 
in=ernational sanctions and a potential war over its nuclear program -- would h=ve better things to do than discourage 
its youth from masturbating. Yet the=regime continues to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into Chinese censo=ship 
technology to create a moral Iron Dome
