This week was dominated by the shutdown. =/span>It's as much a shutdown of the executive functions 
of the brain as it is of the government. A monumen= to monumental stupidity, it's also a shutdown of possibility, and of 
whatever residual trust the public still =as in the American political system. Even those doing the right thing by fighting 
it were reduced by the sheer absurd=ty of the situation. All to try to reinstate a sequester-level budget that is itself 
horrifically self-destruc=ive (note to media: the Affordable Care Act and sequester are the compromises, =nd bad ones, 
at that). That's right -- we've now sunk to a level in which the merely horribly self-destructive=is a goal that seems out 
of reach. So our leaders play games instead of even attempting to address the real problems, like the roughly 20 million 
unemployed or underemployed Americans. <=pan style="font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;line-

THIS WEEK's MUSIC 
=div style="text-align:center"> 
Long before I knew the name Curtis Mayfield,=I had been a huge fan of his as The Impressions were one 
of my favorite R&B g=oups and he was a member. Curtis Lee Mayfield (June 3, 1942 — December 26, 1999) was an 
American soul, R&B, and funk sing=r, songwriter, and record producer. He achieved success with The Impression= 
during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and recorded the soundtrack t= the blaxploitation film Super Fly, 
Mayfield is regarded as a pioneer of fun= and of politically conscious African-American music. He was also a 
multi=instrumentalist who played the guitar, bass, piano, saxophone, and drums. Mayfield is a winner =f both the 
Grammy Legend Award (in 1994) and the Grammy Lifetime Achiev=ment Award (in 1995), and he was a double inductee 
into The Rock and =oll Hall of Fame, inducted as a member of The Impressions into The Rock and Roll=Hall of Fame in 
1991, and again in 1999 as a solo artist. He is also a two-t=me Grammy Hall of Fame inductee. 
The Impressions are an American music group from Chicago, originally formed in 1958. Their repertoire 
includes doo-wop, gospel, so=l, and R&B. The group was founded as The Roosters by Chattanooga, Tennessee natives 
Sam Gooden, Richard Brooks and Arthur Brooks, who moved to Chicago and added Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfi=ld to 
their line-up to become Jerry Butler & the Impressions. By 1962, =utler and the Brookses had departed, and after 
switching to ABC-Paramount Records, Mayfield, Gooden, and new Impression Fred Cash collectively became a top-
selling soul act. Mayfiel= left the group for a solo career in 1970; Leroy Hutson, Ralph Johnson, Reggie Torian, Sammy 
Fender and Nate Eva=s were among the replacements who joined Gooden and Cash. Inductees into b=th the Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, The Impressions are best =nown for their 1960s string of hits, many 
of which were heavily influenced by gospel music=and served as inspirational anthems for the Civil Rights Movement. 
They are =lso 1998 Grammy Hall of Fame inductees for their hit "People Get Ready", and are winners of th= Rhythm and 
Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award (in 2000). 
In 1963 The Impressions released their million-selling gold single "It's All Right", that topped the R&B 
charts and m=de it to #4 on the pop charts, and became one of the group's signature songs. "It's All Right" and "Gypsy 
Woman" were the anchors=of The Impressions' first LP, 1963's The Impressions. 1964 brought the first of Mayfield's 
Black pride anthem compositions, "Keep on Pushing", which became a Top 10 smash on both the Billbo=rd Pop and R&B 
charts, peaking at #10 Pop. It was the title cut from th= album of the same name, which also reached the Top 10 on 
both charts. Future M=yfield compositions would feature an increasingly social and political awareness, including the 
following year&#=9;s major hit and the group's best-known song, the gospel-influenced "=eople Get Ready", which hit 
#3 on the R&B charts and #14 on the pop char=s.
