early on about possible restriction} on use and further development and on limitations, if any, on 
the ultimate size of the house. 
3. 
Rights to the Land or Building cannot be transferred, pledged or assigned without my 
agreement' Subject to the other ideas identified in this letter, the house-builder would have 
complete year-round access to the house. Other island residents (but not the restaurateurs or 
their clients) waysiga 
up to a house-builder's property line; some 
overland access must be created for beach and waterfront areas. House-builder may veto a 
contiguous newcomer. 
House-builder and guests would have overland access to some, but not 
necessarily all, beach and waterfront areas. The building would formally be part of the hotel, 
which in any case enables it to be held under the hotel's landholding and rental entitlements. Local 
counsel would draft optimal lanavo ensure that the concepts of this letter conform to local 
standards and would define the nature of ownership rightS, presumably via a sublease eellteitee 
tymplatrangement with the Norman Island tv_td 
4. 
Staff. Staff must be vetted and approved by island manager. Staff would not have their 
primary residence on the island: tenancy rights are too easily assured. No family members of staff 
arc to live on island. Accordingly, each staff member should have an apartment or place to live in 
town and should overnight at such place at least two nights a week, other than when the owners 
or their guests are in residence or there is some risk of hurricane that needs an on-site caretaker. 
To ensure island-wide uniformit , the igand untuagcuitilDave input (and ultimate veto) in 
respect of staff identity, w 
scares. and working conditions. 
5. 
Guests. To prevent undesired tenancy rights, guests beyond sixty days should be notified to 
the island manager and approved. 
6. 
Vehicles. Each house may have up to two golf carts and two quiet two- to three-wheel on-
road-only sport vehicles. Dock access for one or two boats may be obtained and, if we can get it 
from Government, the right to anchor up to two boats in the Bight or elsewhere. 
7. 
Dock Access. The central management fee would include a charge for the amortization of 
the dock times the proportion of the dock to which a house tenant wants full- or part-time access, 
if any. If none, a mooring can be used (subject to getting a seabed license). 
8. 
An Island Manager would be appointed; his cositand other administrativtand.maintenance 
costs would be shared in proportion to residential and business land used. He would also be 
responsible for ensuring compliance with the concepts of this letter and local laws and standards; 
with proration of regulatory costs, taxes, and fees; and for ensuring and providing or engaging all 
road-building, engineering, construction, dock access and purchasing services; and for all villa and 
hotel rental and/or brokerage services. 
9. 
Problems Avoidance. Noise, nuisance, sewage, and appearance standards rules would be 
agreed prior to house building. I think common sense will govern the development of such rules 
and I look forward to any suggestions. No cats or other pets (other than fish or dogs) are 
allowed on island; Manager approval is required for keeping a dog as a pet. 
10. 
Arc there any conservation or other issues that still need discussion?
