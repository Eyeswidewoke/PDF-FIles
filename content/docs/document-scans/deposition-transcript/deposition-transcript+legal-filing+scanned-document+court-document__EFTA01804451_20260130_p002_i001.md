I remembered that when wed once discussed math in particular, an isosceles triangle and I revealed I hadn t studied 
math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via 
messenger. It was a book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was 
certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in 
his company and you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that Andy as 
Jeffrey calls him is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if 
one things for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he s talking about far more than Andy 
does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. Its almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I ye spent hours talking to 
her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent 
weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her 
rolodex would blow away almost anyone else s I can think of probably even Rupert Murdochs . She is very well-read and 
can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, 
(known fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess ) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to 
things she really cares about and Ariadne is one of them Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And 
then Jeffrey took her in. She s never forgotten that and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for 
her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then 
Ghislaine s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive black hole he d 
fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey s habits may not have seemed that strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in 
the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved 
countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don t tend to get to the top by 
being the worlds most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn t quite manage a normal life 
whatever that is. He had a second wife for many years whose existence he has been open about. 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to 
friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she II be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and 
Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes.
