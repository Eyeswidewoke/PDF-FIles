captain than I. You already have one in Larry. I would suggest that it will prove difficult to 
find a better suited co-pilot for you and Larry. 
-I know my stuff, but I have no ego about being right in the cockpit, unlike 99% of other pilots. I 
am not trying to compete with Larry. I am there to make his job of flying easier, I anticipate 
his needs and I am comfortable being his 'flying assistant'. That dynamic makes for a 
safer cockpit than you would have with a macho pilot trying to prove himself. 
-During every flight, we spend time discussing possible emergencies and ways to deal with them, 
sometimes I pull out a test where we both answer FAA questions, sometimes we go 
through emergency checklists, we discuss regulations and look up answers - I do it to 
learn but it also refreshes his memory and in turn we are both more alert and 
prepared to handle anything during the flight. Do you think this is the cockpit 
conversation when another co-pilot is flying? 
-The other advantage of having me fly, and an important one at that, is my integrity - unlike Dave, I do 
not try to cover up my mistakes. I am better than most pilots with my flight hours, but I know 
I don't know everything and I am not embarrassed to ask for help. 
-I am calm and collected in emergencies and very capable of handling high stress situations. Thanks to 
the differences between LV's and my experience, our emergency responsibilities are clearly 
divided. Larry lies and I run the checklists and handle radios. We both do what we do best. 
Would you feel safer if Dave was the captain on a leg so in an emergency he ended up 
flying and Larry just worked the checklist? I don't think so... 
-I am ahead of the plane during all stages of flight. Because I love it, I pay attention, think of what 
happens next, I scan the instruments and catch discrepancies. 
-I never skip checklists, even when I could continue without them. Most seasoned pilots do, and 
complacency can be more dangerous than inexperience. 
-I actually use standard terminology and enjoy the lack of ambiguity in radio and crew 
communication, I don't fool around. 
-I am very good when it comes to co-pilot duties. I always show up earlier than I need to. I go above 
and beyond to get the plane nice and ready, I don't mind being stuck with the menial 
preflight tasks that nobody likes to do. I get the cabin ready the way you like it...how often 
do you have music playing, new magazines, a devil dog and a freshly made bed with a hot 
water bottle, when I am not flying? 
Think about the airlines, there is always One person in the position of power. When you have 
two, things get complicated. American Eagle co-pilots have as little as 500hours and 
the safety record is not any lower (numbers). It is when there is tension, competition, 
macho attitudes and complacency in the cockpit, that bad things happen. With me, 
neither of those is an issue. Think about your other co-pilot options...
