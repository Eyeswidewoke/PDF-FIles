represent for me a stable rock in my c=aotic life. I'm not talking only about the financial part which obviou=ly helped me 
a lot but more important you turned into a Father, a lover, a=mentor, a friend... Everything. I've isolated myself from all 
the peop=e that surrounded me to follow your directions because spending time with =ou is what gives me the most 
happiness. At that moment what else should I =ave done ? I reacted impulsively because in that instant everything 
turned=black. I know it must be difficult to deal with a 21-year-old's feelin=s and I understand you can lose your 
patience. I wish I would have had you= wisdom so that I could keep up with you. But I can't. I also thought =our promise

Whe= I lied to u it was always the consequence of my reckless acts. The reason=l lie is when I'm scared to deal 
with the truth so I make up stories t=ying to get around your imminent anger or deception. Obviously it never works and
