DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS 
Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
Overview 
On August 8, 2012, Blue Buffalo Company, Ltd., our wholly-owned indirect 
subsidiary, entered into a senior secured credit agreement, 
or credit agreement, with Citibank, N.A. as the administrative agent, 
swingline lender and issuing bank, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan 
Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, 
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as syndication agent, and the 
lenders from time to time party thereto, which provided us with our term 
loan facilities and our revolving credit facility. The proceeds from the 
term loan were used to fund a special dividend of $350.0 million to our 
shareholders. The credit agreement was amended on December 6, 
2012, February 15, 2013 and December 9, 2013 to, among other things, provide 
additional term loan borrowings, allow for distribution of 
dividends of $50.0 million and to re-price our senior secured credit 
facilities. 
As of March 31, 2015, our senior secured credit facilities provide, 
exclusive of any original issue discounts, senior secured financing of 
$440.0 million in the aggregate, consisting of (1) $400.0 million in 
aggregate principal amount of term loans maturing on August 8, 2019 and (2) a 
$40.0 million revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity 
available for letters of credit and for short-term borrowings) maturing on 
August 8, 2017. As of March 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings 
under the revolving credit facility and $390.1 million of outstanding 
term loans under the term loan facilities.
