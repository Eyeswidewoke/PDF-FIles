aiv class="gmail_msg">These are my goals: 
1. Photography:=Learning photography because it's my real passion ( after Jeffrey ) an= I have an eye for

2. Next: being represented by Next as an influencer no= just because of my name but as a professional 
photographer and promote my=work or fashion brands. 
3. Acting classes ( =f possible) 
4. Train regularly and keep a he=lthy lifestyle 
I will work hard in order to achieve these goals.=/div>
