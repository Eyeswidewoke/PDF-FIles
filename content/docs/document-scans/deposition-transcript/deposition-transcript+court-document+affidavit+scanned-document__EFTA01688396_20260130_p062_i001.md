witness/victim through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone 
message books retrieved from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered

be notified by 
and made appointments for the females to "work" for Epstein. The females

When asked how young, Mr.

most. The massages would occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom: He knew this because he often set 
up the massage tables. I asked if there were things going on other than a massage.

were times towards the end of his employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a 
long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. Additionally, he stated the bed would almost
