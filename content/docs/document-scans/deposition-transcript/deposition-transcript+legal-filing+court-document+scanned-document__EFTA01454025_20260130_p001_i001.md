such and hereby authorize the Executing Broker to mark the order as being "long". The 
designation of a sell order as being "long" shall constitute a representation by you that (i) you 
own the security with respect to which the sale order has been placed and (ii) if the Prime Broker 
does not have the security in its possession at the time you place the sell order, you shall deliver 
the security to your Prime Broker by settlement date in good deliverable form and if you fail to 
deliver as such, pay to the Executing Broker any losses and expenses it may incur or sustain as a 
result of Prime Broker's failure to settle any such Prime Brokerage transaction on your behalf. 
You further agree to provide the Executing Broker with information reasonably required 
concerning any securities borrowing arrangements made by you and/or your Prime Broker in 
connection with any short sales. 
.5. Customer Qualification 
(a) You understand that you shall be required to maintain in your account with your Prime 
Broker such minimum net equity in cash or securities as may be required, from time to time, 
by your Prime Broker (the "Minimum Net Equity"), which shall in no event be less than the 
minimum net equity required by the SEC Letter, as such requirement may be amended from 
time to time (initially: (i) $100,000 in cash or securities with a ready market, for trades 
executed on behalf of a customer account managed by an investment adviser registered under 
Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (a "Registered Investment Adviser"), or 
(ii) $500,000 in cash or securities with a ready market for trades executed on behalf of an 
account not managed by a Registered Investment Adviser). You further understand that, in 
the event your account falls below such Minimum Net Equity, you shall bring your account 
into compliance in a timely fashion. Each time you enter an order with the Executing Broker, 
you hereby represent that you shall be in compliance with such Minimum Net Equity or will 
notify the Executing Broker otherwise. 
(b) In the event that your Prime Broker indicates its intention to disaffirm any trade, you hereby 
authorize and instruct your Prime Broker to provide to the Executing Broker, upon the 
request of the Executing Broker, the following information: (i) the account or accounts to 
which any of your orders or trades relate; (ii) the instructions, if any, provided to your Prime 
Broker regarding the allocation of any orders or trades to any sub-accounts; and (iii) 
information available to your Prime Broker with respect to any net equity in the account. In 
addition, this Agreement will serve as further authorization and instruction to your Prime 
Broker to furnish to the Executing Broker in the event of a disaffirmance all such further and 
additional information concerning an account as the Executing Broker shall request, provided 
that such authorization shall have been confirmed by you in a separate letter addressed and 
delivered to your Prime Broker and the Executing Broker. This paragraph shall remain in 
effect so long as this Agreement is in effect, shall survive the termination of this Agreement 
and shall apply to all orders and trades given by you to the Executing Broker for clearance 
and settlement through your Prime Broker. You hereby agree to release and discharge your 
Prime Broker from all responsibility and liability arising out of or incurred in connection 
with your Prime Broker famishing any accurate information to the Executing Broker 
pursuant to this paragraph. 
6. Confirmations 
The Executing Broker shall confirm the Trade Data to your Prime Broker and shall issue a 
confirmation for each Prime Brokerage Transaction by the morning of the next business day after 
trade date. As used in this Agreement, the term "Business Day" means any day which is not a 
Saturday or Sunday on which The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. is open for business. You 
may direct the Executing Broker to send confirmations to you in care of your Prime Broker; the 
form of such directive may be obtained from the Executing Broker and appended to this 
Agreement.
