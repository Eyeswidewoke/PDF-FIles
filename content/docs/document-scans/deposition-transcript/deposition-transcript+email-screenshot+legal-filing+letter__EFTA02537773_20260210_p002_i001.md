Epstein also enlisted his=staff in the predatory activity, and four—a, 
Lesley Gro=f, and 
figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Ag=eement stipulated that they would not be 
charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duti=s, 
worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily =9Cmassages" was stocked with fresh recruits. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years 
Epstein's live-in partner, also recruited young girls. 
Since his 13-month senten=e for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits 
brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute dea= last week, days before a scheduled trial; each 
received well over $1 million—an =mount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth. 
The victims told police t=ey waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often g=ve 
them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn state=ent that a maid named Lupita, who was a 
devout Catholic, wept when she complain=d to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled 
towe=s and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein wi=h the pope hung next to one of him 
with a young girl. 
Ironically, Rodriguez, wh= ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced to more jail time 
than his b=ss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein's activities<=span>. He was fired, he says, for 
inadvertently drawing police attention to one of th= girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money. 
He saw an unfamiliar "beater" in the driveway one evening and called =11. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriguez 
took away some notes and emails about massage appointments as "pr=tection" against his own prosecution, and failed 
to produce them during the Palm Bea=h Police Department's initial investigation.

Unable to get work as a h=use manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this =80 golden 
nugget"—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the vic=ims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an undercover 
cop, and was subsequently charged with "obstruction of official proceedings" for with=olding information that could 
have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—whic= by that point had been settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez was 
sentenced to 18 months=in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach co=nty jail), and 
now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporti=g firearms, another deal he says 
he made to pay the bills after he lost his j=b. 
In a deposition given for=the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to alwa s have $2,000 in =ash on 
hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruite=s such as 
who brought them to 
the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and i= return 
was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of his various =ars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by local 
police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to earlier donations to 
the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given the department 
$100,000=for some sophisticated equipment. The police were still researching the purchas= when Epstein came under 
suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (=uy Frostin, one of Epstein's local attorneys, told police that Epstein 
also gav= $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was "very passionate=E2 about massages being 
"therapeutically and spiritually" beneficial= Yet victims told police they had no massage training.) 
Perhaps most disturbing, =span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">in terms of possible=sex trafficking, 
was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc Brunel= owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in 
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District o= Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel,
