East but I also think it says I-95 
You'll go over a small bridge (thats always in disrepair!) 
immediately after the bridge we get into the far right lane, and exit the highway to 
get on the "Bronx River Parkway" 
After the bridge, you could just stay on I-95 and take that for a couple of miles until 
you get to the Hutchinson River Parkway exit, this is usually what GPS recommends, but 
we find there is so much traffic that way, so we take the Bronx River Parkway. If you 
follow GPS, you'll do I-95 to the Hutchinson Pkwy to 684. If you do our directions, 
you'll do I278E/I95 to Bronx River to Cross County East (exit 11E) to Hutchinson River 
Pkwy North to 684 North (Hutch turns into 684 North if you stay to the left). More 
complicated, but less traffic! 
The main goal is to get to 684! :) 
Once on 684 North, you take it for a while until the exit for 84 East toward Danbury. 
There is a rest stop about 4 miles before the 84 East exit if you need to stop on 684 
North. 
After you're on 84 East, your GPS is going to tell you to take a different way through 
New Milford on 202 East/7 North but that is always really crowded on the weekends, and 
is more difficult, so we would recommend the following directions once you get on 84 
East, go all the way to exit 15 and your GPS will adjust accordingly. 
Stay on #84 East (toward Hartford) until Exit 15 
Turn left at the bottom of Exit 15; you are now on Highway #6 East 
Take #6 East for 5 4 miles to Route #47; turn left onto Route #47 North 
Go just 1 mile on Route #47 to where you veer off to the right onto Route 
#132 North 
Stay on Route #132 North/East for 5 4 miles to Judge Lane (as a landmark, look for a 
small sign hanging off to the left that says "Wellspring"; you will be 
turning left, but veering off to the right instead of making a hard left 
After only 4 mile you will hit a stop sign; continue straight (road also 
goes off to the right); the road will wind around a bit; after 1 mile you 
will come to an intersection where you should bear right, and you will now 
be on Todd Hill Road; go for 1 mile and you'll get to a stop sign 
Continue straight until your second left which will be Evergreen Passway!
