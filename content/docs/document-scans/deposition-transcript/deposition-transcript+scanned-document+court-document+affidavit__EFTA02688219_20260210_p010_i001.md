OpliOpia, Inc. Business Plan for Jeffrey Epstein 
April I . 2011 
2. Autorefractors inspire customer confidence that the resulting prescription is 
accurate, and so refractionists with autorefractors in the developing world have 
higher revenues, 
3. Autorefractors facilitate higher throughput- both because of speed and also 
because of the use of non-professional help during the refraction, enabling the 
refractionist to focus on other issues. such as disease diagnosis. 
We estimate that once the autorefractor is established in an area as a signal of 
quality service, most practicing refractionists would like one. For example, in 
Nicaragua, India, and China it has been observed that when multiple optical shops 
offer "computer testing", the rest of the shops buy an autorefractor to stay 
competitive. As such, we believe that we can capture a significant share of the 
65,000 optical shops that currently do not use autorefractors. Assuming half of them 
purchase an autorefractor over the next seven years. and we capture one quarter of 
these new customers, we will achieve sales of 8,125 units. Additionally, many of the 
35,000 stores who already have autorefractors are likely to need replacements as a 
result of wear, providing additional volume. Our pro forma financials conservatively 
estimate cumulative sales of 8,400 units over the first 7 years. 
We will begin with targeting large economies with many potential customers. 
Attractive target countries include: India, China, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Russia, 
Nigeria, and South Africa. The most attractive initial markets at this point appear to 
be India, in partnership with Aravind and LV Prasad, and Mexico or Brazil. 
Direct marketing and promotion. We will take a similar direct marketing and 
distribution approach in the developing world as in the developed — approaching 
large chains, using direct mail to smaller entities. and partnering with distributors. The 
main difference will be that in the developing world we will try to achieve high market 
share using saturation methods instead of "skimming" for niches, as in the U.S. 
Identifying and communicating with the potential customers is relatively easy, though 
not as easy as in the developed world. In each country, major optical chains exist, 
typically with local outlet shares of 15-40%. For example, in Nicaragua Munkel had 
30 of 60 outlets in the country. The largest one in Mexico has 550 stores, of roughly 
5,000 in the country (data from -2003 -- and needs to be updated). This pattern is 
repeated in many parts of the world, offering a good way to begin in any specific 
country. We will then try to create a standard of service that local competitors will 
strive to match. This can be done by including small window signs or customer 
information cards about the autorefractor. 
Fulfillment. We will always seek to find a local distribution partner who will deal with 
product importation, legal registration, fulfillment, customer access, inventory 
management, billing, and customer service capabilities. We anticipate that the local 
partner will require 35-50% margins.
