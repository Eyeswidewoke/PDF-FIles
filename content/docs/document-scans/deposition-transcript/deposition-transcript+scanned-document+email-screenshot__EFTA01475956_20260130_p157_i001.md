World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
1. Dollar: Dollar strength challenged GDP and especially S&P EPS and 
performance all of 2015. It is important that any further dollar gains be 
very slow and not materially exceed 5% in 2016 from DXY —100 levels. 
2. Unemployment and Unit Labor Costs: If unemployment falls quickly 
from 5.0% today despite still-slow growth, on less participation, then 
Fed hikes might exceed our 1% expectation at 2016 end. It's important 
that unit labor costs don't jump over 2%. Higher wage growth is great 
if funded by better productivity, but if unit labor costs approach 3%, 
Treasury yields could jump over 3% even if US growth stays slow. 
3. Yield Curve: Historically, a flat or inverted curve is very cautionary. 
The 
curve remains steep, but with exceptionally low Fed Funds rates. If 
10yr yields fall well under 2% as Fed hikes we'd likely be concerned. 
4. Credit costs: Conditions at high yield credit markets are concerning, 
but we are encouraged by very low loan losses at banks. 
5. Fiscal conditions: US fiscal conditions are healthy, but politically 
driven 
tax hikes or government disruptions or broad spending cuts are a risk. 
Key to 2016 S&P upside: Good S&P sales growth resumes with yields still low 
2015 was a lost year of S&P EPS growth owing to exceptional headwinds from 
the surge in the dollar and collapse in oil prices as well as weak 
manufacturing, 
capex and exports. However, growth was strong at Health Care, parts of Tech 
and Consumer Discretionary, albeit disappointing at many Retailers given 
macro tailwinds. Ex. Energy, Financials, Health Care and AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, 
S&P EPS growth is about 2.5% in 2015. Less currency drag and good growth 
from Health Care and most of Tech should bring 5% S&P EPS growth in 2016. 
A third of S&P revenue and 40% of its profits are earned abroad. However, a 
substantial amount of Tech and Energy foreign earnings is still in dollars. 
We 
estimate that roughly 25% of total S&P profits are earned in foreign 
currencies. 
Thus, every 10% appreciation in the dollar vs. major currencies hits S&P EPS 
by 2.5% or $3. In 2016, we see 1.5% or $1.75 of S&P EPS drag or 2.5% drag at 
Tech and Industrials (including exports), roughly 2% at Staples and Health 
Care 
and 1.5% at Consumer Discretionary. Yet Consumer Discretionary, Health Care 
and Tech should still deliver 5%+ sales growth. Only slight growth is likely 
at 
Staples and Industrials, about 5% growth at Financials. Energy is a wildcard 
with 2016 earnings possibly -10% to +30%, but Energy is now a small 
contributor to total S&P EPS. S&P net margin likely flat with 1% share 
shrink. 
Financial shock risk? Dominoes of dollar, oil, corporate credit and S&P 500 
The S&P's 2015 broad-based revenue recession and flat non-GAAP S&P EPS 
has underscored a big risk despite the high likelihood of continued US 
growth. 
We believe the worst of the profit recession is behind us for the S&P 500, 
but if
