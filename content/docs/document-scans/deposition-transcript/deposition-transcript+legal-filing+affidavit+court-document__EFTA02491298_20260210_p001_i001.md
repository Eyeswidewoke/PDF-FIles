Re: GIV update

I spoke to Gulfstream engine Tech Dave, he informs Gulfstrea= PBI was scheduled to accomplish an engine 
change on Monday for another cl=ent, This client just canceled his reservation. Gulfstream has the en=ine stand and 
Sling to remove our engines in house now. 
Kathleen advises that if we install Loaner engines that are located in=lndianapolis, they require a post inspection 
from a previous install,=this takes apporx two days to accomplish, so my best case scenario would b= Friday arrival of 
loaner Engines in Palm Bch or Dallas if we elected=to have Dallas Airmotive to install, plus I'm not sure if Dallas =irmotive 
has available manpower to take us next week. 
I spoke with Kathleen and Aline our Montreal Tech, appears T=unnion Mount Canister which handles fwd and 
aft movement should be re=laced, as I mentioned last night, this requires removing engine from =ylon in order to access 
Trunnion Mount. 
Gulfstream has Two new Trunnion Mount Canisters in Savanah price= at $12,000 each. 
According to my CMP Mx run, our canister were last changed in4>=A01998 at 3800 hours total time, we have 
9000 hours total time on airframe= we have 5200 hours on current Mount canisters. 
Here is my proposal if you agree: 
Have Gulfstream PBI remove our engines with sling and install two new =runnion Mount Canisters and fly with 
our engines ONE more time. If I start=today or tomorrow, I should be able to test fly by Thursday or Friday. 
If we install two loaner engines plus New Trunnion Mounts at the =ame time and we have smooth flight, we will 
not know if we had ant>=A0engine issue or Mount issue. 
If we install loaner engines, it takes two days after each engine is r=moved to transfer all Gear box components 
(such as: air starter, Alternato=, hydraulic pump) to loaner engine, called "QEC" (Quick En=ine Change),. by just slinging 
our engine and installing New Trunnion moun=s, I can accomplish this in less time. 
Our engines are due midlife overhaul on November 2018. 
I have requested Gulfstream to price the removal and install labor cos= per engine, if memory serves correct, I 
believe labor to remove and insta=l is approx. $7,500 per engine,. I'll have firm labor cost as soon I h=ar back from my 
Gulfstream sales rep. 
Kathleen needs until Late Monday for her to consult with Rolls Ro=ce in Germany, if there is any chance of early 
input for overha=l. By installing new Trunnion Mount Canisters and our problem still e=ists, this could assist in early 
input of our engines for o=erhaul.
