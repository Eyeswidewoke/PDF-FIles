To: Philip Michaels; Philip Michaels; Jeffrey Epstein; Glenn Davis 
Subject: Meeting: Thursday, Aug. 16, 4:30pm at 666 Fifth Ave. 
Dear Philip: 
I do know that you have said from the beginning that we have a open and clo=e case against my brother and could easily 
threaten him with jail for brea=ing the law about not exercising his duties as trustee of my father's trus=. 
Having said that ....here is some new and some repetitive info. 
#1. Thank you for making the time to meet with me. I am bringing Glenn Dav=s, my accountant and Jeffrey Epstein will 
be on the phone. 
#2. As you all know, thanks to Jeffrey's perseverance we have collected $8=0,000.00 from my mother's estate. 
Apparently my brother Gary was never no=ified by his lawyers about a letter that may have been sent requesting that 
money. It was Jeffrey's phone call that persuaded/forced him to send the=check. 
#3. I would like you to please have all the boxes of my mother's papers th=t I gave to you a year and a half ago at my 
mother's death brought to the =eeting. Your assistant, whom I spoke to today, was not aware of the boxes= They need 
to be gone thru. 
#4. Jeffrey did have a conversation with my brother yesterday and he said h= has never signed any papers pertaining to 
giving my mother permission to =nvade my father's trust....or if she took the money, put it on her own acc=unt and then 
wrote the checks to him...there was never any signature of 
#5. He maintains that my mother broke the law, not him. He was just the be=eficiary of her generosity. Phil, we do 
know that Gary's name is on the w=II as a trustee of my father's trust...and written permission is the law. =ls this 
enforceable? 
#6. We need to know if my mother paid Gary directly from the trust. 
#7. We need to go thru the boxes and find the checks to Gary and determine =hat account she wrote them on....her 
personal account or the trust. 
#8, Gary maintains he "did not know she was taking my father's money" mean= to be split between both his son and 
daughter and giving it to him. 
#9. He is lying because he knew all my mother's money was left by my father= He morally did not care he was getting 
money and I was not. 
#10. He told Jeffrey that my mother chose to treat me badly and that is not=his problem. The truth is he lost millions on 
a business my father left h=m and went to my mother saying he was going to lose his home if she did no= give him 
money. He cried poverty and she bailed him out many times. It's=all documented in those boxes of all her financial 
papers I took from her =ome office. 
#11. I have said for a year and a half, that Gary was never able to make a =iving...and has been on the take his whole life. 
#12. I have repeatedly asked for an accounting of all money spent from my m=ther's estate and I would like you to 
respect that request and to request =hat now from his lawyers. There surely is misappropriation of funds. =20 
#13. You have told me for a year and a half that we could not get any money=until the Alpine house and Palm Beach 
apartment were sold. Both have been=sold. All the money is in.
