aircraft-expenses> 
I suggest you focus on large issues first. . the discussi=ns re personal use of plane . parties travel. may 
be relevant =t the tippy tip of the margins but these answers should=C2 flow from the structure. On what form will 
you use the =eduction. ? which business. , its structure. different buisnesses =AO etc. 
Barry , what you will find is that there is very few answers t= be found on point as people in leons 
position rarely make cases to tax co=rt. exception being estate issues. . =lanes owned by farmers salesman, 
bankers. are usua=ly small planes. meaningless to leons issue. large biz gets are usually =wned by corporations. . 
the facts. th=re are approx 400,000 planes in the states. out of that large =umber only about 13, 000 total private jets. 
out of tha= class only 2000 large jets and most owned by corporations. how many people have bu=iness of leons size 
. not including his art work. 
You asked , me what do we do now. as=l told Brad years ago. First and foremost is accur=te 
numbers presented in an organized fashion. that is 8= percent of the grunt work. Once all the numbers are in shape = 
ie materials for the building of the financial architecture. . Leons goals must be add=essed and programatic . this 
takes hours of discussion.=C2 . next . plans are drawn up, . modifications are made,=C2 issues of sec regulation, tax, 
control, successio=. mechanics. all need to be planned and adjusted to meet the goals. 
You need to recognize that there are few , very few exa=ples of the house that in leons case needs 
to be re built. =AO most people with leons wealth have a serious family office=C2 with a huge stock portfolio. , not art. 
and of those , =ew hold dormant assets ie apollo.. Its been ten years since apoll= went public. and the house needs 
total renovation. =AO upgrades in tech, security, and the family has changed =AO all very similar to architecting a 
house after the children have grown =nd left.
