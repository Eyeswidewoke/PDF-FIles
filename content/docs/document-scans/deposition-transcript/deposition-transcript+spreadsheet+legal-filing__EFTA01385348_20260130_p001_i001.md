Lem Vegas: Exceeding Prior Peak Levels in 2018 
Our outlook for Las Vegas remains positive as we continue to expect low-to 
mid-single-digit RevPAR and low-single digit GGR growth over the near term. 
While the recovery of Las Vegas is in its late innings, with several indicators 
(such as RevPAR and convention mix) reaching prior peaks we believe that 
limited new supply, healthy convention trends (attendance: +5.1% YTD, mix: 
16.1% of total visitors), and a reinvigoration of domestic play should support 
further growth. 
Modest GGR Gains Factoring YTD results and our expectations for November 
and December, we estimate Las Vegas gaming operators should report 
gaming revenues of $6.49 billion (+1.8% versus $6.38 million) in 2017 owing 
primarily to higher domestic play. We expect slot revenue to increase to $3.18 
billion (+1.7% versus $3.12 million). Meanwhile, we expect non-baccarat table 
win to rise to $2.14 billion (+4.9% versus $2.04 million). We note that non-
baccarat table win is benefitting from higher hold (+85bps YTD). We believe 
that higher hold relates to: (1) game mix towards higher hold games with 
added low-value wagers, (2) player-unfriendly rule changes, and (3) more 
leisure-oriented gaming patrons. Lastly, baccarat revenue is projected to 
decrease to $1.18 billion (-2.9% versus $1.21 billion). It is worth noting that 
results have been hurt on a YTD basis by unfavorable hold (-90bps). 
Looking into 2018, we anticipate gaming revenue will increase to $6.68 billion 
(+2.8% versus $6.49 million). On a segment basis, we estimate slot revenue to 
increase to $3.23 billion (+1.7% versus $3.18 million). Meanwhile, we 
anticipate higher non-baccarat table play of $2.23 billion (+4.4% versus $2.14 
million). Lastly, we are forecasting baccarat revenue of $1.21 billion (+3.9% 
versus $1.18 million.
