25.20 
Each Compartment has recently been created and has therefore no significant operating history. 
General economic and market conditions 
25.21 
The success of the Company's activities may be affected by general economic and market conditions, such as 
interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws and national and 
international political circumstances. These factors may affect the level and volatility of security prices and 
liquidity of the securities held by the Company or its Compartments. 
25.22 
Unexpected volatility or liquidity could impair the Company's profitability or result in its suffering losses. 
Unspecified Investments 
25.23 
No assurance can be given that the Company (or any Compartment thereof) will be successful in obtaining 
suitable investments or, if such investments are made, that the objectives of the Company (or the Compartment) 
will be achieved. Investors will be unable to evaluate the economic merit of any future investment which may be 
acquired. Investors must rely entirely on the judgement of the General Partner, the Investment Committee and, as 
the case may be, the Investment Adviser with respect to the selection and acquisition of investments. 
Insufficient risk diversification 
25.24 
During the Kick-off Period, a relevant Compartment may be exposed to a single investment. After the Kick-off 
Period, a relevant Compartment may be exposed to specific segment, asset class or geographical region and, 
hence, be susceptible to adverse economic or any legal or regulatory occurrence affecting that investment, 
segment. 
Foreign currencies and exchange rates 
25.25 
The Company directly or indirectly may hold for the account of a relevant Compartment or Class assets in 
currencies different as the Reference Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may therefore affect 
the value of Investments and hence have a negative impact of the performance of the Company, the relevant 
Compartment or Class which will additionally bear the costs triggered by the conversions between various 
currencies. 
Illiquidity 
25.26 
Investments made by the Company for the account of a relevant Compartment shall generally be illiquid and 
consequently it may not be possible to sell these Investments at prices that reflect the General Partner's 
assessment of their value. The nature of the Investments may also require a long holding period prior to 
profitability. Consequently, disposals of Investments may require a lengthy time period or may result in 
distributions in kind of securities in lieu of or in addition to cash. In the event the General Partner makes 
distributions of securities in kind upon the dissolution of a relevant Compartment or Class or upon the 
liquidation of the Company, these securities could be illiquid or subject to legal, contractual and other 
restrictions on transfers: in addition, payment in kind shall be made with the consent of the Investor receiving 
this in kind consideration and shall be determined on an equitable basis amongst the Investors. 
Valuations 
25.27 
Most of the Compartment's Investments will be highly illiquid, and will most likely not be publicly-traded or 
readily marketable. The General Partner will therefore not have access to readily-ascertainable market prices 
when establishing valuations of the Investments and the General Partner and the Company can provide no 
assurance that any given Investment could be sold at a price equal to the market value ascribed to such 
Investment in connection with the General Partner's or an Independent Valuces valuation thereof. Actual realised
