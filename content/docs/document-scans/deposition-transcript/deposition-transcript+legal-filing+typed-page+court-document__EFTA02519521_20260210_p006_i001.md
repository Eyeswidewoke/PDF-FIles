I asked Ms. Beauchamp for =ontact information for this guest. I did call the 
guest and she =ubstantially confirmed what Ms. Beauchamp had said. I apologized on =ehalf of the organization. The 
guest indicated although she was taken =back by Krauss's proposition at the time, she did not want to =ursue the matter 
further. I then got in contact with Krauss. Krauss =enied the allegation. In light of the guest's reluctance to =ursue the 
matter and Krauss's own denial and, importantly, =ecause between the time of the 2011 cruise and the Galapagos cruise 
we =ad instituted a policy regarding harassment at any CFI event, which covers not =ust employees, but speakers and 
attendees, I decided to go ahead with =y plan and have Krauss as a speaker on the Galapagos cruise. Krauss was =ully 
aware of our harassment policy regarding CFI events because we had =ad a discussion about it. Therefore, I expected 
him to comply with that =olicy on the Galapagos cruise. As far as I know he did, because we =eceived no complaints 
about his conduct. Nor have we received any =omplaints about his conduct at other events. 
let me just take a moment to highlight the 2012 policy, which =ou can find in 
full here, 
http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/cfis_new_policy_on_hostile_conduct_harassment_at_conferences/ 
along with the announcement = made explaining the rationale for the policy. This policy was, =ertainly at its time, 
arguably the strongest any nonprofit organization =ad regarding conduct at its events. Again, this policy shows that any 
=uggestion that CFI, as an organization, or that I personally took a lax =ttitude regarding harassment is completely 
without factual =oundation. 
In your email you mentioned =hat one staffer resigned after I invited Krauss on 
the Galapagos =ruise. I'm not aware of any staffer resigning because of that. =f you give me a name I could comment on 
the reasons for the staffer =eaving. Ms. Beauchamp remained an employee of CFI (and went on the =alapagos cruise 
with Krauss). 
You mentioned =lso the comments that were made to me in March 2012 by 
Melody Hensley. =et me give you the background for that. CFI was holding an event prior =o the 2012 Reason Rally in 
DC. Richard Dawkins, Jessica Alquist, Jamie =askin, and Lawrence Krauss were scheduled to speak at the event. Melody 
=ensley was heavily involved in the planning for the event and in fact =as tapped to make introductions for the speakers, 
including Krauss. (At =he time she was in charge of the DC local branch.) During the planning =or the event she gave no 
indication whatsoever that she had any =esitation about introducing or dealing with Krauss. (I will forward you =ome 
email correspondence confirming this.) 
As I recall, Krauss's schedule resulted in his =fanned arrival being a little later 
than the others. As it turned out, =e was even further delayed. At some point when it became clear that =rauss was 
going to be late, Hensley turned to me and said, "I =now why Krauss isn't coming; he's embarrassed to see =e." I asked 
Hensley what she meant by this. She said Krauss had =ade a pass at her several years earlier and she had rebuffed him. I 
=sked for some details. She said she was in a hotel room with him (I =an't recall whether she said it was Krauss's hotel 
=oom, but I think it was), and that Krauss tried to kiss her. She pushed =im away and said she wasn't interested. I asked 
if Krauss =ersisted; she said he did not. Thinking out loud, I believe I said =omething to the effect of 'well, if you want to 
make a =omplaint you probably can, although I'm not sure our policy at =hat time would cover that.' Ms. Hensley said 
she was not =nterested in making a formal complaint. 
Ms. Hensley's statement that I "responded to =er with silence" is absolutely 
false and I categorically and =nqualifiedly deny it. We talked about her concern, as indicated. Ms. =ensley's recall must 
be failing her. 
Given the passage of time (six years), the fact that Hensley =id not want to 
pursue the matter, the fact that Krauss desisted when =ensley indicated she wasn't interested, the fact that Hensley 
=idn't even seem very bothered by the incident (as indicated, =he had expressed no hesitation in seeing Krauss), and the 
fact that we =ad no policy covering conduct by nonemployees back in 2006 (in fact, =FI's zero-tolerance policy covering 
employees themselves was =ot implemented until 2007, I believe -- I was just hired as the =ttorney in July 2006), I 
decided not to do any further about this =articular incident. However, the incident, along with observations I =eard at
