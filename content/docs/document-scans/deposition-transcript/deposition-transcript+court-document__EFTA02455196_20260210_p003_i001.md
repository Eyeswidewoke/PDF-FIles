Fa=tual Background 
Investigation by Palm Beach Police Department 
4>=A0 
As has been reported over and over for the past 10 years. In March 2005, t=e Palm Beach 
Police Department opened a criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein when the father and stepmother of Saige Gonzales 
complained to police about=a visit by their 14-year old daughter to Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach hom=. What has not=been 
reported is that ;Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales informed police that they believed inappropriate conduct =ay have occurred 
between Mr. Epstein and their daughter. The police interviewe= Saige Gonzales, who had visited Mr. Epstein's home 
only once, but 
ought no charges after interviewing her, though monitored activity at Mr. Epstein4)=804,s home 
through sporadic surveillance and occasional trash pulls. 
=C2. There are several reasons that ex lain this result.=C24, Saige told the Palm Beach Police on 
more than one occasion that she was instructed by 
= the woman who brought her to Mr. Epstein's home, 
that Saige had to =ell Mr. Epstein she was 18 years old because, if she was not 18, he would not let h=r into his house. 
Saige also informed the Police that she did in fact tell Mr. Epstein that she was 18 years old. She also informed police 
that Mr. Epstein had no sexual contact with her. Mr. Epstein took a lie detector test, the results of which confirmed that 
Saige told hi= she was 18, that he believed Saige when she told him her age, that he never threatened Saige in any way 
and that no sexual contact occurred with Saige. In addition, Saige, who had previous run-ins with the Police, maintained 
a "MySpace page at the=time of the investigation on which she stated that she was 18 years old, posted naked a=d 
provocative photographs, admitted =o having sex . that she was not a virgin, to using drugs, and =o having beaten 
someone up, and to having shoplifted and claimed=to earn $250,000 or more. 
=C240 
In addition, the persons who filed the police report, Saige4>=99s father and stepmother, 
both had criminal records. The father had served 21 months in federal prison for bank fraud, an= the stepmother had a 
state conviction for identity fraud. Moreover, Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales's true motivation for going to the police later 
becam= apparent when they held a press conference on the courthouse steps announcing their civil lawsuit seeking 
substantial monetary damages from Mr. Epstein.=C2* They commenced that lawsuit without authorization from Saige 
Gonzales =hough she was now an adult. and it was ultimately dismissed. Ms. Gonzales did eventually file her own 
lawsuit in order to profit from these events, despi=e the fact that she had already confirmed to the police that she lied 
to Mr. Epstein, specifically telling him that she was 18 years old, and that no se=ual contact with him occurred [need to
