any Transaction shall be paid free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction 
for, any taxes or duties of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or 
assessed by any authority having power to tax unless the withholding or deduction of 
such taxes or duties is required by law. In that event, unless othenvise agreed. the 
paying party shall pay such additional amounts as will result in the net amounts 
receivable by the other party (after taking account of such withholding or deduction) 
being equal to such amounts as would have been received by it had no such taxes or 
duties been required to be withheld or deducted. For the avoidance of doubt. the 
reference to law" in this paragraph includes FATCA. However, no additional 
amounts shall he payable by the paying party to the other patty under this

does not so withhold or deduct, and a liability resulting from such tax is assessed 
directly against the paying party, then, except to the extent the other party has 
satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such tax, the other party will 
promptly pay to the paying party the amount of such liability (including any related 
liability for interest. Mn including any related liability for penalties only to the extent 
provided in subparagraph Niii)). No payment under this subparagraph (N(ii) is 
required to be made to the extent that the relevant liability arises from any gross 
negligence or wilful misconduct of the paying party. 
(iii) 
The amount of related liability for penalties shall only be payable to the paying party 
under subparagraph (b)(ii) where such penalties become due because the other party 
has failed to provide appropriate US tax forms." 
(O 
A new subparagraph 600 shall be added as follows: 
f at any time a party (the "first party") is required to remit an amount of tax to the IRS 
with respect to a payment under a Transaction in connection with FNMA, then without 
duplication of any: amount the first party has deducted on account of such tax from any 
amount previously paid to the other party (the "second party") pursuant to the Transaction, the 
second party shall be required to pay to the first party an amount equal to that amount of tax 
on the payment date on which a payment giving rise to remittance required under FATCA 
occurs. Upon the reasonable request of the second party with respect to any payment date, the 
first party will supply to the second party computations setting fonh in reasonable detail the 
amount payable on such payment date pursuant to the preceding sentence." 
A new subparagraph 6(I) shall be added as follows: 
"(I) For the avoidance of doubt, the imposition of any withholding or deduction pursuant to or 
on account of FATCA on any amounts paid or received under a Transaction shall not be 
treated as an Event of Default under paragraph le or as a material adverse effect that could 
cause a Tax Event under paragraph IL even if such imposition results in either party receiving 
amounts that differ materially from the amount that the party would have otherwise received if 
no such withholding or deduction were imposed? 
(c) 
A new subparagraph I0(ek iii) shall be added as follows: 
"(iii) The Default Markel Value determined pursuant to subparagraphs (i) or (ii) above shall 
not take into account any deduction or withholding imposed or collected (or that would be 
imposed or collected) in connection with MICA that would not be imposed but for the non- 
Defaulting Party's noncompliance with FATCA."
