Tonight on a launch to Paul Allen's annual party on M.Y. Octopus Ryan Gosling is sitting next to 
me with his "Blue Valentine" producer Jamie Patricof. Their next film, "The Place Beyond the 
Pines" will be directed by Derek Cianfrance and is shooting in Schenectady this summer. Ryan co-
stars with Bradley Cooper. He is a motorcycle stunt rider who robs banks. I ask him for a walk-
on as an innocent bystander in the bank who he throws to the floor before yelling, "Stick urn 
up." Ryan loves it. Patricof agrees. 
Wednesday, May 18 
At the morning screening of Magnolia Picture's "Melancholia" where wedding guests witness 
Melancholia, a planet hidden behind the sun and is now on a collision course to Earth....and that 
is the good news. At the press conference, Danish director Lars von Trier announces, "O.K., I'm 
a Nazi." sending shock waves through the media. He was asked to comment on a recent 
interview in which he expressed interest in the Nazi aesthetic. His mother, on her death bed, 
revealed the Jewish man he thought was his father was not. Lars then found out he is German. 
Making matters worse, he says he has an "understanding" of Hitler. Co-stars Kristen Dunst and 
Charlotte Gainsborough (Jewish) are horrified. Possibly Lars's English is rusty. Reuters later 
prints that the comments were made in jest. What a sense of humor this guy has. He could do 
stand up. Festival officials promptly throw him out of town and cancel his post-premiere party 
that night. What a sorry mess for such a good film. 
This story is as crazy as the other hot gossip of the day that Arnold Schwarzenegger aka "The 
Terminator" aka "The Sperminator" was sleeping with the maid of twenty years and had the 
love child around the house so Maria Shriver could watch the half-brothers (her son with Arnold 
born days apart) grow up together. This is the reel to real suspension of disbelief. 
The Hollywood Reporter's editorial director Janice Min and publisher Lori Burgess host a cocktail 
party at the Martinez beach for Jodie Foster in honor of her directing "The Beaver" with Mel 
Gibson. Keeping with the Nazi theme, Holocaust denier's son Mel Gibson got a standing ovation 
the night before at the Palais for his profound performance as a tortured soul. Not a stretch. 
Countess Nathalie von Bismark (an Israeli Jew) married to Count Carl, throws a cocktail party at 
the Carlton to celebrate a screenplay she has written about his Swedish grandmother, Ann-
Marie Tengbom saki Princess von Bismark-Schonhausen and her sympathetic efforts to help 
displaced people after the war. Can't wait to see the film. I've never been to a cocktail party for 
a script. 
Cinema for Peace holds its inaugural Cannes dinner and auction at the Carlton where Sean 
Penn's humanitarian work in Haiti is acknowledged. Sean hosts an impressive oval table in the 
middle of the room with Leonardo DiCaprio, Harvey Weinstein, Roberta Armani and Vladislav 
Doronin who each pledge $75,000 to the $750,000 total. Also sitting with them is Robert De 
Niro, Ryan Gosling, Uma Thurman, Naomi Campbell, Rosario Dawson and Faye Dunaway. Leo 
tells me he is excited to go to Australia to start work on Baz Luhrmann's "The Great Gatsby."
