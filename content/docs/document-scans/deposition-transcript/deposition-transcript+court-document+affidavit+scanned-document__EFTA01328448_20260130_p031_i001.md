-- Conditions and Limitations --
1. This aircraft does not meet the airworthiness standards of Annex 8 to the Convention on International 
Civil Aviation. Operations in airspace outside of the United States will require the permission of the 
applicable foreign authority. That permission must be carried aboard the aircraft together with this 
U.S. airworthiness certificate and, upon request, be made available to an FAA inspector or the applicable 
foreign authority in the country of operation. Operations may be further restricted by the applicable 
foreign authority. This may include not allowing use of an airport, requiring specific routing, and restricting 
flight over specific areas. The operator must comply with any additional limitation prescribed by the 
applicable foreign authority when operating in its airspace. (1) 
2. These operating limitations do not provide any relief from any applicable law or regulation. This aircraft 
must be operated per applicable regulations and the additional limitations prescribed herein. Note that a 
clearance from air traffic control (ATC) is not authorization for a pilot to deviate from any rule, regulation, 
operating limitation, or minimum altitude, or to conduct unsafe operation of the aircraft. If ATC issues a 
clearance that would cause a pilot to deviate from a rule, regulation, or operating limitation, or in the 
pilot's opinion, would place the aircraft in jeopardy, it is the pilot's responsibility to request an amended 
clearance. These operating limitations are a part of FAA Form 8130-7 and are to be carried in the aircraft at 
all times and to be available to the pilot in command of the aircraft. (2) 
3. This special airworthiness certificate is not in effect during public aircraft operations (PAO). Concurrent 
public/civil operations are not permitted; the aircraft cannot be operated as a civil aircraft and as a public 
aircraft at the same time. No weapons or special military mission systems may be added to the aircraft. 
This airworthiness certificate is not in effect during flights related to providing military services (that is, air 
combat maneuvering, air-to-air gunnery, target towing, electronic countermeasures simulation, cruise 
missile simulation, and air refueling). These activities are inherent military, not civil activities. The FAA 
makes the distinction between the authorized flights for experimental purposes, and PAO. Before 
operating this aircraft under this special airworthiness certificate following a PAO, the aircraft must be 
returned to the condition and configuration at the time of inspection for the issuance of this airworthiness 
certificate. The operator must have written procedures for returning the aircraft to the civil configuration. 
This action must be documented in the maintenance records. The maintenance records and entries must 
clearly differentiate between a civil experimental flight per this certificate and any other flights. (3) 
4. Application to amend this certificate must be made to the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) or
