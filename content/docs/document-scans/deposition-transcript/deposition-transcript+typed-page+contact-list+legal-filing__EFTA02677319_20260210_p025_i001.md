2045 Calculus II 
Faculty: Gould. Heather 
MW 10:00 AM - 11:40 AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 5245 Sec A 
This course will be a continuation of Calculus I. We will discuss methods of integration. L'Hopital's 
rule. convergence of infinite series and Taylor's Theorem. We will also look at functions of several 
variables and the geometry of three-space. Throughout the course. the focus will be on conceptual 
understanding and problem-solving skills. Applications will include calculations of physical 
quantities such as work. area and volume. probabilities, drug levels In the body. and spread of 
diseases.

2050 Math Models in Nature 
Faculty: Wilson, Jennifer 
TR 
10:00 AM 11:40 AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 3956 Sec A 
This course combines aspects of quantitative reasoning and mathematical modeling. Quantitative 
reasoning is the ability to make sense of the numbers that surround us: to find patterns. to 
estimate. and to create mathematical models that help us make informed decisions. In this 
course, students team to use difference equations to describe complex natural phenomena. Using 
spreadsheets as computational and graphical aids they develop the basic algebraic, 
computational, graphical. and statistical skills necessary to understand these models. and learn 
why difference equations are the primary tools in the emerging theories of chaos and complexity. 
This is a required course for the Interdisciplinary Science and Environmental Studies Majors and is 
taught in Fall & Spring.

2105 Making Math and Art 
Faculty: Wilson, Jennifer 
TR 
12:00 PM 01:15 PM 
Credits: 3 
CRN 7551 Sec A 
In this class we will explore the multifaceted and two-way relationship between math and visual 
images. Artists from all cultures and historical periods have been inspired by mathematical ideas, 
while mathematicians have relied on images to represent their thoughts and to help them make 
sense of the visible world. Over the semester, we will look at several places where these two 
traditions have intersected. inspiring new works of both mathematics and art. Topics will vary but 
include Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, symmetric tiling, origami and paper constructions. 
visual representation of numbers, space and relationship, and the artists who have used these 
ideas. The class will also focus on similarities and differences between math-making and art-
making and the role of constraints. experimentation, generalization and refinement. Students will 
have opportunity to do mathematics. make art and be reflective about their experiences with both.

LMUS 
2003 Composition & Analysis 
Faculty: de Kenessey. Stefanie M 
03:50 PM - 06:30 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 5924 Sec AX 
This class explores the act of musical composition both from a theoretical and a practical vantage 
point: we study short examples from diverse centuries and cultures; we imitate various aspects 
(structural, harmonic, rhythmic) of these models; and, finally, we write free compositions in a 
workshop setting, with an informal In-class performance at the end of the semester. Previous 
experience with music is strongly recommended; this course also serves as a sequel to 
Fundamentals of Western Music.

2020 Lang at Scratch DJ Academy 
Faculty: Rapport. Evan

03:50 PM - 05:30 PM 
Credits: 2 
CRN 5136 Sec A 
This course introduces students to the art of Dffng with a master 01 at the nearby facilities of 
Scratch DJ Academy. The focus is on the fundamentals of mixing. scratching, and beat juggling, 
using turntables and vinyl, in order to develop a solid technical foundation, an inner beat, and a 
distinct personality that can be applied to changing technology. Students also learn about the 
history and cultural context of Wing techniques. Class size is limited to 15 students.

08:00 AM 09:40 AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7506 Sec A 
New and evolving technologies provide unprecedented creative opportunities for musical 
composition/production and performance/reproduction. This course surveys the field of music 
technology from historic-al, philosophical, and hands-on practical perspectives. Topics include the 
physics of sound and the technology of acoustic instruments: case studies on compositional 
techniques such as musique concrete and electronic synthesis: studio mixing, recording and 
production techniques: and digital sampling and editing software. All of these topics are framed in 
a broader understanding of music technology as both concept and construct. 
LMUS 
3019 Music and Digital Media 
Faculty: Briggs. James 
MW 01:50 PM - 03:30 PM 
CrimIltS: 4 
CRN 4516 Sec A 
This course provides further hands-on practical experience working with digital media for musical 
composition/production and performance/reproduction. Fundamentals of sound synthesis. 
sequencing and programming, and sampling are covered, in connection with prevalent tools and 
programs such as Protools. Logic, Reason, and MAX. In addition to practice, the course will 
incorporate historical and theoretical perspectives on sound design, composition, and sound art.

3028 Microtonallty 
Faculty: Hale. Casey 
TR 
11:55 AM 01:35 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7505 Sec A 
this course explores the sonic, aesthetic, spiritual and philosophical perspectives of selected 20th-
century composers of microtonal music. Searching out new scales and harmonies beyond the 
twelve tones of the piano, these composers question basic assumptions of Western music and 
seek out new worlds of musical perception and practice. In many cases, these transformed 
musical worlds are accompanied by transformed world views. Students will analyze the composers' 
musical works and writings, study tuning and temperament in historical, theoretical and cross-
cultural perspectives, and experiment with approaches to microtonality in their own creative 
projects. utilizing new or altered instruments and/Or electronic media. The course is designed for 
students with some background in music and an openness to experimentation.

3030 Music of India 
Faculty: Higgins. Nicholas 
TR 
10:00 AM 11:40AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7168 Sec A 
This course explores the music of India from musical and cultural perspectives, Investigating the 
classical, folk, and popular musics of India while considering the meaning and problematic nature 
of such classifications. Topics will include classical Hindustani and Karnatak musics, light classical 
styles such as thump and ghazal. Indian folk music. Sufi ciaivivali performance, film music, music 
of the diaspora, and intersections between the musics of India and the West. Points of discussion 
will include aspects of music theory, learning, and performance practice: ideological and 
philosophical conceptions about the music: the changing balance of cultural authorship: ways of 
recording, distributing, and listening to music; and the sociality of music itself. No previous 
background In music Is required, but a willingness to engage with musical Ideas and fundamentals 
of Indian music theory is expected.
