to 40S/bbl, he would not see a need for OPEC to cut production. In other news, 
the forties stream is having some technical issues, with Buzzard production 
halted. Furthermore, Libyan fighting over the weekend has shut the ES Sider 
terminal and possibly the Ras Lanuf terminal, which is causing the production 
of the 160kbd Wafa field and some other smaller fields; this puts Libyan 
production below 400kbd. There was also a 3 day Nigerian oil worker strike 
that started today. There are no apparent loading delays yet but there are 
rumors that the NNPC did not approve any new loadings today.Also, the NSEA 
window was bid today with Jan 7-10 forties being bid up to +35 cents. BRE 
spreads took notice and rallied sharply, with the prompt BRE spread trading up 
to -13cents.Quite close to backwardation! In products land, European 
distillate was weak again, with the prompt gasoil crack trading below 13S. US 
distillate on the other hand was extremely bid, with cash trading strong. 
OIL VOLS 
oil vols rallied aggressively today as we made new lows in both crudes. WTI 
vols rallied more than BRE vols. 20d puts vs 20d calls rallied another 3 vols 
in H1 2015, although we did see some faint interest in selling prompt puts in 
BRE towards the end of the day. The back end of the curve was quieter, 
although we did see some interest in selling z16 100SWTI calls. Overall, the 
market is panicked about further downside and everyone is short. So until we 
stop dropping for a while, it's hard to see vols going down much in cal15. For 
those not seeing much of a chance of oil going below 454, but don't see much 
of a rally ahead either, something like a clz5 45/75 DNT at 31% would make 
sense..

The base complex was looking relatively strong in the morning on expected 
Chinese stimulus but traded down in the afternoon, reversing gains from the 
morning on a weaker dollar and lower oil. Copper prices saw modest gains in 
the morning reversing the gains at around 13:00 before coming off heavily in 
the afternoon, crashing through S6300. Australia's Bureau of Resource and 
Energy Economics is forecasting a 300 kMT copper surplus in 2015. China's 
Gansu province, the 4th largest copper producing region in the country 
increased it's output by 20% to around 93 KMT in October, however Shandong, 
the 3rd biggest copper producing region saw a drop in output from -101kMT to 
96kMT. Rio Tinto sees the copper market entering deficit in 2018 on increased 
demand in electricity networks as they build and incorporate more renewable 
energy sources. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are amassing copper holdings in 
order to repeat it's iron ore strategy of squeezing out high cost producers. 
Their jointly owned Resolution project in Arizona could meet 25% of US copper 
demand on it's own, Escondida in Chile could produce lmnMT/year -5% of world 
output. Nickel prices reached highs of 516860 this morning on news that First 
Quantum shut it's 38 kMT Ravensthorpe plant in Australia after a sulphuric
