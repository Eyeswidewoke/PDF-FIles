would say to Jim and Paul, "Why do you =all your patients poor people? They don't call themselves poor people.&quo=; 
Jim would reply: "Okay, how about soon-dead people?") 
They talked about the insignificance of "cultural bar=iers" when it came to the Haitian peasant's acceptance of modern 
West=rn medicine: "There's nothing like a cure for a disease to change peo=le's cultural values"... 
By now Peru was tax=ng PIH's resources severely. On average, the drugs to treat just one patie=t cost between fifteen 
and twenty thousand dollars. And the number of pati=nts kept growing. Already there were about fifty Carabayllanos in 
treatmen=. Their average age was twenty-nine. They were students, unemployed youths= housewives, street vendors, 
bus drivers, health workers. The actual numbe=s seemed small, but those fifty MDR [a form of tuberculosis that does not 
=espond to standard treatment] cases represented about 10 percent of all ac=ive cases of TB in the slum, about ten 
times more than might have been exp=cted. No telling how many others they had been infecting as they'd travele= 
around Lima, coughing. No telling either how many people in other parts o= the city already had MDR, but [there were] 
reports of hundreds in other n=ighborhoods. In Carabayllo itself, the Socios workers found entire familie= sick and dying 
with what turned out to be genetically related strains of =he disease--a phenomenon common enough that the health 
workers gave it a n=me, familias tebeceanas, tuberculosis families. 
Ki='s organization confronted Peru's MDR-form tuberculosis epidemic with what=some have called unorthodox practices 
-- borrowing and cajoling its way in=o medicine for its patients. 
Howard Hiatt, a frien= of Jim Yong Kim's and a former dean at the Harvard School of Public Healt=, said he was 
concerned about how PIH was getting medicine to combat the e=idemic: 
"Sure enough. Paul and Jim would sto= at the [Harvard-affiliated] Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru an= fill 
their briefcases with drugs. They had sweet-talked various people in=o letting them walk away with the drugs." [Hiatt] 
was amused, all in =11. "That's their Robin Hood attitude." In fact, they'd only bor=owed the drugs... 
Then one day the president of th= Brigham stopped Hiatt in a corridor. "Your friends Farmer and Kim ar= in trouble with 
me. They owe this hospital ninety-two thousand dollars.&q=ot; Hiatt looked into the matter. "Sure enough. Paul and Jim 
would st=p at the Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru and fill their briefca=es with drugs. They had sweet-talked 
various people into letting them walk=away with the drugs." He was amused, all in all. "That's their R=bin Hood 
attitude." 
To many seasoned manage=s of public health projects, what Farmer and Kim were doing would have loo=ed quite 
reckless--like a stunt, as some would later insinuate. They didn'= have a guaranteed supply of drugs, only the 
determination to obtain the d=ugs and the charm to get away with borrowing. They were borrowing their la=oratory 
services, too, from Massachusetts. They lacked proper institutiona= support. The weight of expert opinion stood against 
them. Their organizat=on was small and it had other projects, in Haiti and Boston and elsewhere,=and Peru put a strain 
on everyone. Jim had to travel to Carabayllo at leas= once a month. Farmer had to go there slightly more often. 
Kim's audacious 'Robin Hood attitude' won him and PIH acclaim for =heir role in changing global health and 
development. 
=p class=MsoNormal style=imso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt=autol>ln June 2002 ... the WHO adopted 
new prescriptions for dealing with MDR-=B, virtually the same as PIH had used in Carabayllo. For Jim Kim this mark=d 
the end of a long campaign. "The world changed yesterday," he =rote from Geneva to all of PIH. The prices of second-
line antibiotics cont=nued to decline, and the drugs now flowed fairly smoothly through the Gree= Light Committee to, 
among other places, Peru, where about 1,000 chronic p=tients were either cured or in treatment. About 250 were 
receiving the dru=s in Tomsk, and, largely because of the efforts of WHO, the Russian Minist=y of Health had finally 
agreed to the terms of the World Bank's TB loan--1=0 million dollars to begin to fight the epidemic throughout the 
country.
