- HEATH LEDGER 
"Jean-Louis Rodrigue always brings a personal and positive approach to his 
coaching work. His involvement is timeless and complete. He is generous, genuine. 
and creative such that even when a character or a story is frightening, it becomes 
about exploring the work and being of service. Jean-Louis has a dear view of the 
character the actor is playing and also an awareness of the purpose and structure of 
the whole movie, which engages the entire actor's intention and responsibility with 
the project. His work is a useful and exciting way to open my channels for my 
research as an actress. 
- JULIETTE BINOCHE 
"The Alexander technique is invaluable to actors of all ages. It helps us find new 
depth in exploring the physical and emotional life of a character. And it has helped 
me correct physical issues which affect my daily life. Jean-Louis and Kristof 
immediately create a level of trust and comfort in teaching this technique which 
allows all of us in the class to open up to the learning experience. I continue to work 
privately with them because I believe so strongly in their skill in teaching this 
technique, and its positive effect on my well-being." 
- JOBETH WILLIAMS 
"Jean-Louis Rodrigue is a popular movement coach in Los Angeles whose specialty 
is helping actors bring gracefulness and fluidity to their performances. A 
combination of acting coach , AlexanderTechnique teacher and movement 
specialist , Mr. Rodrigue uses techniques that have much in common with dance 
training. His teachings emphasize an awareness of the body and the physicality of 
performance. When performers make the physical component of their work as 
important as the intellectual, they become far more convincing and 
seamless." 
- VALERIE GLADSTONE, New York Times 
"The absolute best Alexander classes are given daily by my four-month old son. 
Kristof and Jean-Louis are a dose second. They are not only expert in the theory and 
application of this incredible technique but pursue their work with a vibrant, 
contagious love. Their endeavor to help performers choose a new physical life that 
allows them to be more fully present--in essence, to use themselves differently--is 
profound, and has implications not only for life on the stage, but for life in general. 
Kristof and Jean-Louis create a beautiful work environment: safe, rigorous, 
personal--and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. I am so grateful to have had 
the opportunity to work with them. And they don't spit up nearly as much as my 
son!" 
- PETER HERMANN " War Horse" Broadway 
"Jean-Louis is a gifted teacher. Some teachers are able to adjust, fix, or produce 
results in students immediately. However, often their work does not have a lasting 
value. Jean-Louis is not in that category. His understanding of the Alexander 
Technique and the psychology of the American actor is such that he is able to leave a 
lasting impression on most of the actors he encounters. It is a pleasure to be able to 
testify to his skill, ability, and artistry"
