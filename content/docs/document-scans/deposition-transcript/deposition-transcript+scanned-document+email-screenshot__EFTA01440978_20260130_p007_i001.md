Form W-9 (Rev. 11-2017) 
Page 3 
Criminal penalty for falsifying information. Willfully falsifying 
certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties 
including fines and/or imprisonment. 
Misuse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of 
federal law, the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. 
Specific Instructions 
Line 1 
You must enter one of the following on this line; do not leave this line 
blank. The name should match the name on your tax return. 
If this Form W-9 is for a joint account (other than an account 
maintained by a foreign financial institution (FFI)), list first, and then 
circle, the name of the person or entity whose number you entered in 
Part I of Form W-9. If you are providing Form W-9 to an FFI to document 
a joint account, each holder of the account that is a U.S. person must 
provide a Form W-9. 
a. Individual. Generally, enter the name shown on your tax return. If 
you have changed your last name without informing the Social Security 
Administration (SSA) of the name change, enter your first name, the last 
name as shown on your social security card, and your new last name. 
Note: ITIN applicant: Enter your individual name as it was entered on 
your Form W-7 application, line la. This should also be the same as the 
name you entered on the Form 1040/1040A/1040EZ you filed with your 
application. 
b. Sole proprietor or single-member LLC. Enter your individual 
name as shown on your 1040/1040A/1040EZ on line 1. You may enter 
your business, trade, or "doing business as" (DBA) name on line 2. 
c. Partnership, LLC that is not a single-member LLC, C 
corporation, or S corporation. Enter the entity's name as shown on the 
entity's tax return on line 1 and any business, trade, or DBA name on 
line 2. 
d. Other entities. Enter your name as shown on required U.S. federal 
tax documents on line 1. This name should match the name shown on the 
charter or other legal document creating the entity. You may enter any 
business, trade, or DBA name on line 2. 
e. Disregarded entity. For U.S. federal tax purposes, an entity that is 
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is treated as a 
"disregarded entity." See Regulations section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iii). Enter 
the owner's name on line 1. The name of the entity entered on line 1 
should never be a disregarded entity. The name on line 1 should be the 
name shown on the income tax return on which the income should be 
reported. For example, if a foreign LLC that is treated as a disregarded 
entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a single owner that is a U.S. 
person, the U.S. owner's name is required to be provided on line 1. If 
the direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity, enter the first 
owner that is not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the 
disregarded entity's name on line 2, "Business name/disregarded entity 
name." If the owner of the disregarded entity is a foreign person, the 
owner must complete an appropriate Form W-8 instead of a Form W-9. 
This is the case even if the foreign person has a U.S. TIN.
