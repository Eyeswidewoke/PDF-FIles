importance of attentive care and attention to details and mechanics. with regard 
Phaidon I was not shown one single document , not one.!! Brad wanted to keep 
it private between he, and his so called " advisors " however as he was out of 
the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get to spend 
time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is totally ludicrous -
to summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - of things I thought 
were a priority to get done - still remains in the whole unresolved. Neither 
Alan nor Brad has reviewed the BRH agreemennt or the TRA , the two largest 
financial assets of your portfolio , inexcusable . 
The IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperate need of a new system - reporting 
badly flawed , and both cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -
off exercises , when either you or brad ask for it - airplane: re structure, (my 
only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead then it was then , 
consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was recently told by 
Brad not to share the outside proposals with me - brad has no idea even as to 
what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost 
everyone in the office. . Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her 
head , that is a huge difference. bad info is rampant a simple emblematic 
example- 3 million in deductions Pm told were taken for art space but on closer 
examination it turns out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you 
will be told yes they were deducted on the return they said that is the only real 
question you were focused on ! " were they deducted or not - correct question 
would have been " is there a benefit " !! I asked for the balance sheet and/or P 
and L for Regan arts , the basic first step in order to check your financials. 
"sorry we never got one?" though 9.8 million invested, no p&I, nothing!, a 
construction project run amok , no budget, the coo fired after only 3 months. , 
no clue . fyi artspace financials are also a total mess. ( no receivables ??). when i 
asked for a list of what got done and did not, i received the email from Brad 
basicailly mind you own business. 
so much was promised. !!! 
As in your words im one of your closest friends and in order to turn the page. I 
include the following in order to be constructive 
Here is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely 
not by me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts 
as they remain a paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their 
importance. THe Phaidon transaction papered and structured as contemplated 
DOES NOT WORK , its as simple as that. DOES NOT !! I suggest again that 
you re-do bank loans. no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . 
as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do will, make suydam executor , with 
Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid of 
Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at
