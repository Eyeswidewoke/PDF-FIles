Subject: Private and Confidential, in response to our meeting.</=> 
Dear Naimah et al: 
Attached you will find a lett=r from my attorney, along with a letter he sent to 
Buzzfeed earlier in thi= week regarding the defamatory and false story they were planning on print=ng. The story was 
then published yesterday morning. </=> I wanted to add to his letter, to reitera=e our concern about how your office 
was planning to follow up on the false=and defamatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because =his was 
initiated by an online entertainment news outlet with a clear agen=a and established record of propagating false 
allegations about me, rather=than by any of the individuals they refer to as sources, this should =ot be considered a 
credible allegation worthy of investigation. I believe =hat our initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter.Q=A0 
Whether or not you agree with this, there are t=o things I think are important to establish. 
Firstly, that the University should not propagate w=at can be false allegations 
from such a source by presenting them directly=to current and/or former employees or to others. To do so would be t= 
further their libelous agenda, as Mr Waldman has emphasized. In thi= regard, I would appreciate seeing copies of the 
correspondence you might =end to current or former employees about this in the process of carrying o=t and concluding 
your investigation. 
=div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001ptfont-size:12ptfont-family:"Time= New 
Roman",serif">Secondly, </al reiterate once again that the Origins Project environment is supportive= candid, frank, 
honest, and productive, with all employees being treated w=th respect, as well as being supported and mentored. I am 
proud of our tea=, and I believe they feel the same way.

Thanks for your attention to these letter=.

Dear Ms. Saadiq: 
My name =s Adam Waldman, and I am Professor Lawrence Krauss' litigation 
cou=sel. Earlier this week, I sent the attached letter to Buzzfeed via o=e of their reporters named Peter Aldhous. 
I am also in receipt of Mr. Aldhous*=99 letter to ASU, which is a variation on 
defamation — both libel =nd slander — that Mr. Aldhous and his colleagues have been manufac=uring for at least 6 
months (notably without any reporting) in a campaign =ith a purpose known only to them. Buzzfeed's first method is=to 
call or write third parties, posit a list of fake, anonymous, recklessl= false and malicious "allegations," and ask if the third 
p=rty has anything to add. Buzzfeed's second method is to seek=tortious interference with Professor Krauss' 
professional contract=, by writing third parties with whom Professor Krauss is in privity, prese=t a similarly inflammatory 
series of anonymous, recklessly false and malic=ous accusations, and then question: how can the email's recipient =flow 
such a person to serve on their board, or speak at their conference?=C24> The letter from Buzzfeed to the University 
falls into both categorie=. There will be appropriate legal consequences for Buzzfeed's acti=ns. 
It is my unde=standing that your office believes it is compelled by the above to 
investi=ate false, defamatory, anonymous accusations posited by the online tabloid=Buzzfeed by contacting third parties 
and potentially rebroadcasting the ta=loid Buzzfeed's accusations. To be clear, these accusations =ere not made to the
