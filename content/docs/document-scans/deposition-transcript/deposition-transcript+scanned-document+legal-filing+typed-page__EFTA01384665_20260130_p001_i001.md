borrowing or selling short the underlying asset. The value of a derivative is linked to the price 
movements in the underlying asset. Therefore, many of the risks applicable to trading the 
underlying asset also may be applicable to derivatives trading. However, there are a number of 
additional risks associated with derivatives trading. Transactions in certain derivatives are subject 
to clearing through a U.S. clearinghouse while other derivatives are subject to risks of trading in 
the over-the-counter markets, and others are subject to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. Price 
movements of futures and options contracts and payments pursuant to derivative agreements are 
influenced by, among other things, the longevity of the contract, interest rates, changing supply 
and demand relationships, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of 
governments, and national and international political and economic events and policies. The value 
of futures, options and derivative agreements also depends upon the price of the assets that are 
underlying them. In addition, an Underlying Fund's assets are also subject to the risk of the failure 
of any of the clearinghouses or counterparties. Additional risks associated with derivatives trading 
include: 
Tracking. When used for hedging purposes, an imperfect or variable degree of correlation 
between price movements of the derivative and the underlying investment sought to be hedged 
may prevent an Underlying Fund from achieving the intended hedging effect or expose an 
Underlying Fund to risk of loss. If an Underlying Fund invests in derivatives at inopportune times 
or incorrectly judges market conditions, the investments may lower the return of the Underlying 
Fund or result in a loss. An Underlying Fund also could experience losses if derivatives are poorly 
correlated with its other investments. 
Liquidity. Derivatives, especially when traded in large amounts, may not be liquid in all 
circumstances, so that in volatile markets an Underlying Fund may not be able to close out a 
position without incurring a loss. In addition, daily limits on price fluctuations and speculative 
position limits on exchanges on which an Underlying Fund may conduct its transactions in 
derivatives may prevent profitable liquidation of positions, subjecting the Underlying Fund to the 
potential of greater losses. The market for many derivatives is, or suddenly can become, illiquid. 
Changes in liquidity may result in significant, rapid and unpredictable changes in the prices for 
derivatives. 
Leverage. Trading in derivatives can result in large amounts of leverage. Thus, the 
leverage offered by trading in derivatives may magnify the gains and losses experienced by an 
Underlying Fund and could cause an Underlying Fund's net asset value to be subject to wider 
fluctuations than would be the case if such Underlying Fund did not use the leverage feature of 
derivatives. 
Over-the-Counter Trading. Derivatives that may be purchased or sold by an Underlying 
Fund may include instruments not traded on an exchange. The risk of non-performance by the 
obligor or derivative counterparty on an instrument may be greater than, and the ease with which 
an Underlying Fund can dispose of or enter into closing transactions with respect to a security or 
instrument may be less than, the risk associated with an exchange-traded security. In addition, 
significant disparities may exist between "bid" and "asked" prices for derivatives that are not 
traded on an exchange. Derivatives not traded on exchanges also may not be subject to the same 
type of government regulation as exchange-traded securities, and many of the protections afforded 
to participants in a regulated environment may not be available in connection with the transactions.
