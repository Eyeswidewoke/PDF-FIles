Money market mutual funds are not FDIC insured. SIPC will provide protection 
in the case of an insolvency of Pershing (DBSI's clearing broker-dealer), which 
will have custody of your fund shares. SIPC does not protect against ordinary 
market loss in the value of a money market fund. 
Money market mutual funds have a fiduciary duty to seek the highest yield 
available for their shareholders (less tees and expenses) consistent with 
prudence and their investment objectives. Your yield wi€l be based on your 
share of the total return of the securities the fund has invested in. 
Although money market mutual funds seek to preserve a net asset value 
(NAV) of SI per share. an investment in fund shares may incur losses if the 
fund's assets decrease in value. There is no guarantee against loss and the 
investment is not insured or guaranteed by FDIC. 
Money market mutual funds will charge a tee based on the percentage of 
cash invested. This fee will reduce the return you receive. 
Each participating money market mutual fund pays certain processing and 
revenue sharing fees to Pershing and DBSI based on the total amount of cash 
swept into the fund. Please note that a majority of the money market mutual 
funds offered to DBSI customers are owned by DBTCA. DBSI Client Advisors 
receive no compensation with regard to money market mutual funds. 
Investors in money market mutual funds should carefully consider information 
contained in the applicable prospectus, including investment objectives, 
risks, and fees. You may request a prospectus by contacting your 0851 Client 
Advisor. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. Please refer to 
the Cash Sweep Option Disclosure document for additional information which 
is available from your DBSI Client Advisor or at littpl/www.pwm.db.comf
