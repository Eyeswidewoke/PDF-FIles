Jeffrey.. Thanks very much for your advice.. We are not yet in the labor=law 
phase.... nowhere near that yet.. We are in the OEI invest=gation phase, and I repeat they are tasked merely with 
deciding what, if a=y violations of university policy they view as probably having occurred. =C2 Moreover, all she was 
doing was covering her bases.. She didn =99t indicate whether the allegations that were reported to the University =ere 
based on the University reaching out to individuals after the Buzzfeed=story who then wrote to the University. There 
are a host of question= that need to be answered. and wiggle room with questions at or after meet=ng... Moreover, just 
because someone from Mongolia complains about me does=not mean the University is empowered to investigate that.. 
In any c=se, just FYI.. I am sending you the section of the ABOR regulations on Dis=issal or Suspension of Tenured faculty, 
so you will see it is a long proce=s that extends way beyond what I am embarking on next week. 
In any case, as a result, I am taking the f=llowing action today. I want to 
continue listen carefully to your ad=ice, believe it or not, but I need to feel I have a legal expert familiar =ith Title IX to 
talk with as well, and there is no perfect person.. =ut Nancy and I have decided to retain Justin, who, while perhaps too 
eager=to be combative at this stage, will work for me, and not vice versa, and h=s extensive experience with university 
processes, including at ASU. =is main interest is making the process fair, and if it is not, holding the=University 
accountable after the fact. I think that meshes with my g=al as well. I do feel much better about him than I did about 
having Johnny=E2 s lawyer, which was delusional on my part. Plus I will be much mor= critical of advice, as I will be 
bouncing it off you as well.. I h=te spending the money, but Nancy reminds me that in the old days this is l=ss than I 
would have received for a single lecture.

So, once again, I understand your concerns.frustrations, knowledg=, 
recriminations, etc, but this is what I am going to do. So, I am e=ther going to waste $15K or get some useful payback 
for it, and I will eit=er kindly accept your offer to let me waste your $25K, or my $25K. 1= you feel sufficiently strongly 
that you don't want to follow thro=gh on what you so generously offered before, which was to provide $25K for=me to 
work with however I felt I wanted to do, and perhaps largely for our=mental health if necessary, I will not of course hold 
it against you=in any way. You have been so generous with your time and friendship,=which in the end is so much more 
important. 
ABOR stuff below: 
=div> 
J. Dismissal or Suspension 
1. Tenured Faculty Members 
1. 
Tenured faculty memb=rs shall not be dismissed or suspended without 
pay except for just cause. =uch dismissal or suspension may take effect only following an opportunity =or the faculty 
member to utilize the conciliation/mediation and hearing pr=cedures as prescribed in ABOR Policy 6-201L.3 and L4 
(Conditions of Facul=y Service; Hearing Procedures for Faculty, Conciliation/Mediation and Hear=ng).
