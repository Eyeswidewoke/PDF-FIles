Ratcliffe, "the House Homeland Security Committee said in its Twitter feed that Americans 
should listen" Wray and Krebs. 
The Hill (10/22, Klar, 2.98M) reports that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for her part, on 
Thursday "said Iran is a `bad actor' but not on par with Russia in terms of seeking to influence 
the U.S. election." Pelosi and other Democrats "sought to draw attention on Russian 
interference after" Ratcliffe "warned Wednesday both countries are behind efforts to sway 
public opinion related to the presidential election." ABC News (10/22, 2.97M) reports that Pelosi 
said, "I think we have to be very careful about any statements coming out about the election 
from the intelligence community at this time." 
CNN (10/22, Herb, Fung, Hansler, Cohen, 83.16M) reports that an ODNI spokesperson "on 
Thursday responded to the criticism of Ratcliffe, arguing that his comments were consistent 
with the intelligence community's previous assessments about Tehran's intentions when it 
comes to interference in the 2020 race." Amanda Schoch said in a statement to CNN, "As NCSC 
Director Bill Evanina said on August 7th, the IC assesses `that Iran seeks to undermine U.S. 
democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 
elections." CNN adds that "not all Democrats were critical of Ratcliffe," with SSCI Vice Chairman 
Mark Warner telling "reporters Thursday that he understood why Ratcliffe made the comments 
he did about the effort being intended to hurt Trump." 
New Alert: Russians Targeting Government, Aviation Computer Networks. Jeff 
Pegues of the CBS Evening NewsVI (10/22, story 3, 2:00, O'Donnell, 3.96M) reported, "The 
cyber security alert says the Russian hacks began last month, targeting dozens of government 
and aviation computer networks in the United States, successfully obtaining data from at least 
two victim servers. Since 2016, Russian hackers posed the greatest threat to US election 
systems. In that election, it is widely assumed that they scanned and probed voter databases in 
all 50 states. Today's alert proves they haven't stopped." 
Axios (10/22, Rummler, 521K) reports that Energetic Bear, a Russian state-sponsored 
hacking organization, "has stolen data from two servers after targeting state and federal 
government networks in the U.S. since at least September," the FBI and CISA announced. 
However, the FBI and CISA "said Thursday they do not have evidence that Energetic Bear 
compromised elections data or government operations." Politico (10/22, Geller, 4.29M) reports 
that while "hackers have 'exfiltrated data from at least two victim servers,' the agencies said 
they saw no indication that the intruders had 'intentionally disrupted any aviation, education, 
elections, or government operations." Energetic Bear "is best known among security 
researchers for its intrusions into European energy companies, including firms in the oil, gas 
and electric sectors." USA Today (10/22, 10.31M) reports that CISA Director Christopher Krebs 
"described the activity Thursday has a 'broad scanning' effort by the Russians that had not 
interfered with actual voting." 
Bloomberg (10/22, Mehrotra, 4.73M) reports that while the FBI and CISA "don't have any 
evidence that attacks have disrupted victims in aviation, education, elections or government, 
they raise concerns that the successful compromises could open the door to more malicious 
attacks in the near future." Reuters (10/22, Satter) reports that the names of the targeted 
governments "were not disclosed. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The FBI provided no further details but said in a statement that it was 'shining a spotlight on 
Russia's nefarious behavior." 
The AP (10/22, Tucker, Bajak) reports that US officials "have repeatedly said it would be 
extremely difficult for hackers to alter vote tallies in a meaningful way, but they have warned 
about other methods of interference that could disrupt the election, including cyberattacks on 
networks meant to impede the voting process." Still, NPR (10/22, Ewing, 3.12M) reports that 
the "agencies involved have been warning for months, including with similar bulletins about 
cyber-risks confronting U.S. elections infrastructure, which they have suggested likely would 
focus on systems adjacent to core operations — such as a website that shows results — as 
opposed to the casting and counting of ballots themselves." CNN (10/22, Herb, Fung, Hansler,
