euros per day ) shooting for rogue and Dior, I've got hired by one of the best fashion photographers=called Paolo 
Roversi to be his assistant ( paid job ). I'm very happy =nd excited to work and learn from him which is better than any 
photography=school. I'm ready to work as long as I need to in order to build my sk=IIs and stand out in that field. I think 
I've achieved some results an= gained some value if I compare myself 2 years ago from now. Thanks to you=l had the 
possibility to make many interesting experiences like Ferragamo =n China and Alaia in Paris. Even though I didn't get 
hired from t=em, those experiences allowed me to understand what I like and what I don&=39;t like and shaped in part

=oing what I really like. However even though I work hard and I am paid I c=nnot fully support myself to pay a rent and 
my living in Paris. I really w=uld like to continue through this path, I feel it's the right one but = need your help, your

I promise I will use my money wisely without throw=ng it away into futilities like parties and holidays 
because I want to gro= and build my skills, my carrier and hopefully my future self.
