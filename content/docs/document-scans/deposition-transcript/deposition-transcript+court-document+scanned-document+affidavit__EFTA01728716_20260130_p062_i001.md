victims (younger than age 12) are more likely to also have to spend time seducing the potential 
victim's parents or caretakers to gain their trust and confidence. An acquaintance molester who uses 
violence is easily identified and likely to be quickly reported to law enforcement, but an acquaintance 
molester who seduces his victims can sometimes go unreported for 30 years or more. The greater 
the skill in selecting and seducing vulnerable victims, the more successful the acquaintance molester. 
For this discussion, the determination of who is an "acquaintance" child molester will be based more 
on the process and dynamics of the child victimization and less on the technical relationship between 
the offender and child victim. An offender who is a stepfather, for example, might be an 
acquaintance molester who used "marriage" just to gain access to children. 
One of the unfortunate outcomes of society's preference for the "stranger-danger" concept 
-has.a.direct impact on intervention into many acquaintance-sexual-exploitation cases. It is what I 
call, "say no, yell, and tell" guilt. This is the result of societal attitudes and prevention programs that 
focus only on "unwanted" sexual activity and tell potential child victims to avoid sexual abuse by 
saying no, yelling, and telling. This technique might work with the stranger lurking behind a tree, 
but children who are seduced and actively participate in their victimization, however, often feel 
guilty and blame themselves because they did not do what they were "supposed" to do. These 
seduced and, therefore, compliant victims may sometimes feel a need to describe their victimization 
in more socially acceptable but inaccurate ways that relieve them of this guilt.

Advice to prevent sexual exploitation of children by adult acquaintances is very complex and 
difficult to .implement. How do you warn children about offenders who may be their teachers, 
coaches, clergy members, or neighbors and whose only distinguishing characteristics are that they 
will treat the children better than most adults, listen to their problems and concerns, and fill their 
emotional, physical, and sexual needs? Will parents, society, and professionals understand when the 
victimization is discovered or disclosed? Much prevention advice simply does not distinguish to 
which types of sexual victimization it applies. The right to say "no" and "good touch/bad touch" 
would be applied differently to a stranger, parent, teacher or physician. 
Children at an early age learn to manipulate their environment to get what they want. Almost 
all children seek attention and affection. Children, especially adolescents, are often interested in and 
curious about sexuality and sexually explicit material. In today's world, they will sometimes use 
their computer and online acres to actively seek out such material. They are moving away from the 
total control of parents and trying to establish new relationships outside the family. 
In almost all criminal cases I know of where an adolescent left home to personally met with 
an adult they had first met online, they did so voluntarily in the hope they were going to have sex 
(not to get help with their homework) with someone they felt they knew and who cared about them. 
In spite of this reality, prevention material dealing with online child safety continues to repeatedly 
warn only about not talking to strangers and advise children to tell their parents if someone they meet 
online makes them feel uncomfortable. Is it realistic or even accurate to suggest that someone you 
regularly bommunicate with for weeks or months is a "stranger" just because you have not met them 
in person? Further, ask any adult what was the number one thing on their mind when they were
