10% . . You. believe that same person will ,when told about your lifestyle,  will side 
with you , and say well it appears that you do so much, and try so hard, I believe

Subject you should keep this email 
I have tried but not succeeded in trying to teach you, guide you, empower you. I have 
asked that you read some of the great books so that your conversation would be 
based on more than yahoo news and tv talk shows. I have not succeeded.. I had 
asked that you keep in shape and learn to cook, i have not succeeded. to learn to 
taste not only food but distingusih quality from the commonplance. The things that 
you write that have broken our relationship are not the things that you have done are 
right but the things that have been wrong. I tried to teach you a different way of life, 
beautiful things, elegant and unusual ideas. and introduced you to a life that few get 
to see. Your needs as you describe them center on what I should not do. It is 
pretty simple, without a realtionship with you. I would have been able to do more„ 
and without our relationship you would have been able to do much less. You need 
to seek advice elsewhere. Get professional guidance. I love you and hope that 
someone holds your behavior up to you so you can see for yourself.
