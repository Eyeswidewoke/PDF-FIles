Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits 
among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sae drsaetion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to calculae FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature (including current transactions) Different daily 
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous tilling periods) (2) add any new transactions, debts, or fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or treats. and (4) ,ffinake any appropriate adjustments For each day after the first day of the billing 
period, we also add an amount of in 
t equal to the presto°, day, daily balance multtplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily Mance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. II this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
billing penod anddivide the total by the number of days in the being period. Thisgives us the ADB for the Feature. If you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. II you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in the billing period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rountIng. The total FC for the 
billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account This method of calculafing the ADB 
and FC results in daily oonpounding of FC. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a 
foreign currency, it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency s no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, orb) the highest interbank conversion rale identified by us from customary banking sources on the 
conversion date or the pnor business day, In each Instance Increased by 2.7%. This conversion rale may differ from 
rates in effect on the dale of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates
