l'= glad that you find the idea interesting and think that you might 
consider=it, though you have to consult lawyers first. 
My own view i= different. To me the proposal I suggested seems to be a 
very simple=way of settling this matter, which to me is extremely troubling. I r=alize that this is just another case of a 
longstanding difference in the w=y we approach these problems, a difference that has been clear ever since =e were 
discussing the interest on the loan from the Trust and found that w= could not communicate because I mistakenly 
assumed that it was a discussi=n among family members while your letters made it very clear and explicit =hat you saw 
it as a legal issue to be settled among lawyers and Bainco, pe=haps with a mediator in the adversary proceeding. All 
matters I find=it very hard to comprehend, and to live with, but so be it. 
The matter is very simple.4>=A0 We can proceed without delay if you 
agree to settle the issue in the si=ple manner that I suggested. 
As for your proposals in your =etter of March 29, as I wrote you, the 
letter was so shocking that it was =ard for me to bring myself to respond, but I did, in detail, but decided n=t to send it. 
Perhaps I should. Will think about it. 
=/div> 
As for your proposals, my response was the obvious one. I'm=sorry for 
the stress you had to endure, but your efforts were a waste of t=me for reasons I had already fully explained before you 
undertook them.Q=A0 As I'm sure you recall, a few years ago, I requested tax payments f=om the marital trust when 
my IRA was being rapidly depleted by my advisers=who were distributing half to family and using the other half to pay 
manag=ment fees and taxes for the entire estate, so that to pay Alex's medic=l expenses and the expenses for Wellfleet I 
had to withdraw excess funds w=th exorbitant taxes, all that before withdrawing even a cent to live on ag=in with 
exorbitant taxes. Your response was to refuse the request un=ess I agreed to intrusive and insulting financial 
investigations -- of a k=nd I never considered when providing funds to you for something you needed= I made it clear 
and explicit at the time that I would not submit to=this procedure. Since your efforts and proposals simply repeat the 
s=me procedure, they were a waste of time. 
There were some th=ngs in your letter that were correct. You're right 
that despite =hat has happened, I'm still a "wealthy man," with income wel= above the median, though lacking a 
pension and accumulated property, not =t the level of my peers. Furthermore, I can supplement my income by =eaching 
large undergraduate courses, something I'd never done and that=is not that common for people approaching 90, but 
something that I enjoy.=C2. And you too are a wealthy man, for the same reasons: the reasons are=that I've worked 
hard all my life, lived fairly simply (and live even =ore simply today), and was therefore able to put aside enough money 
to ens=re that my children and grandchildren are very well cared for, indefinitel=. 
But I again suggest that we put all of this a=ide, and deal quickly and 
simply with what appears to be the one outstandi=g issue: dividing the Marital trust and then dissolving it, all very 
simpl=, needing no lawyers, at least on my part.
