outstanding liabilities (tax or otherwise) and only serves as one of the guarantors for the AES loan which is being 
forgiven as part of the transaction and it owns all of the relevant intellectual property. 
The reason why the invested funds from Nathan's entity are received while one of the existing entities is 
still in the current ownership chain is related to the need to preserve your ability to utilize the NOLs to shield income you 
will receive as a result of the transaction. Please note that any asset transfer from the Club Entity to Newco was not 
feasible because RFR strongly objects to any payment being made to RFR flowing through the Club Entity, whose 
creditors might seek to avoid such transfer(s) in the future. We believe, however, that our proposed structure outlined 
below (which creates a form of "synthetic equity") puts you and Nathan into the same position (economically and from a 
governance perspective) as if you both owned the Club Entity's equity directly. 
You will also see that we have provided for a warrant structure below which is designed to serve as 
extra "insurance" to give Nathan the flexibility that if there is ever a scenario where it is more beneficial to him to have 
"real" rather than synthetic equity ownership in the Club Entity, he will have the option to acquire an actual equity 
interest. Of course, as always, we would be happy to discuss any questions or comments you and/or Russ may have in 
connection with this proposed structure - nothing is cast in stone, we are looking for a structure that will make all parties 
most comfortable and allow for a successful collaboration in the future. 
1. 
TCC IP forms Newco as a new wholly-owned subsidiary. 
2. 
Investor makes a convertible loan to Newco of $6 million. 
3. 
TCC IP contributes the IP and know-how it owns to Newco as a capital contribution (but 
expressly leaves behind any and all liabilities including tax liabilities and founders liability--of which it should have none 
anyway, as they are at the sister or parent level). 
4. 
Newco acquires the AES Loan for $4.9 million and immediately forgives the AES loan. Newco 
pays JE compensation of $100,000 for services rendered. Please note that this money will be used to purchase the TCCI 
and TCGM equity interests as stated in 5 below. 
5. 
JE acquires RFR's interests in TCCI and TCGM for $100,000 (in the aggregate). 
6. 
Newco pays TCCI expenses and reimburses JE for TCCI expenses previously paid by JE ($1M in 
the aggregate). 
7. 
Investor converts convertible loan in exchange for 49% of Newco. Newco's LLC Agreement is 
amended and restated to include governance and exit provisions as previously discussed with your team (and reflected 
in the draft JV Agreement previously sent to you). 
8. 
Newco enters into perpetual license with The Core Club 55th Street (the "Club Entity") to 
license back the IP to the Club Entity (for use in the NYC Club).
