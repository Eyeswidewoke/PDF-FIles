GLOUS126 Pacific Life Insurance Co 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Information will not become publicly available as a result of such Limited Partner's 
rights to access or receive such Partnership Information. 
(b) 
Each Limited Partner acknowledges and agrees that the Partnership Information 
constitutes a valuable trade secret of the Partnership (or of the Underlying Fund to the 
extent such Partnership Information relates to the Underlying Fund) and agrees to 
maintain any Partnership Information provided to it in the strictest confidence and not to 
disclose the Partnership Information to any person other than to its officers, fiduciaries, 
employees, agents, consultants, auditors, counsel or other professional advisors, who 
have a business need to know such Partnership Information, who have been informed of 
the confidential nature of such Partnership Information, and who are, either by the nature 
of their positions or duties or pursuant to written agreement, subject to substantially 
equivalent restrictions with respect to the use and disclosure of the Partnership 
Information as are set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each 
Limited Partner and each Limited Partner's employees, representatives and other agents, 
may disclose to their professional advisors (including, without limitation, their attorneys 
and accountants) or to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other U.S. taxing authority, 
without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal and state income and franchise tax 
treatment and U.S. federal and state income and franchise tax structure of the transactions 
contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax 
analyses) that are provided to such Limited Partner relating to such tax treatment or tax 
structure insofar as such treatment and/or structure relates to a U.S. federal or state 
income or franchise tax strategy provided to such Limited Partner, provided, however, 
that no Limited Partner (and no employee, representative or other agent thereof) shall 
disclose any other information that is not relevant to understanding the tax treatment or 
tax structure of such transaction (including the identity of the party and any information 
that could lead another to determine the identity of any party) or any other information to 
the extent that such disclosure could reasonably result in violation of any U.S. federal or 
state securities law. With respect to any Limited Partner, the obligation to maintain the 
Partnership Information in confidence shall not apply to any Partnership Information 
(i) that becomes publicly available (other than by reason of a disclosure by a Limited 
Partner), (ii) the disclosure of which has been consented to by the General Partner in 
writing or (iii) the disclosure of which is required by a court of competent jurisdiction or 
other governmental authority or otherwise as required by law. Before any Limited 
Partner discloses Partnership Information pursuant to clause (iii), such Limited Partner 
shall promptly, and in any event prior to making any such disclosure, notify the General 
Partner of the court order, subpoena, interrogatories, government order or other reason 
that requires disclosure of the Partnership Information so that the General Partner may 
seek a protective order or other remedy to protect the confidentiality of the Partnership 
Information or waive compliance with this Agreement. Such Limited Partner shall also 
consult with the General Partner on the advisability of taking steps to eliminate or narrow 
the requirement to disclose the Partnership Information and shall otherwise cooperate 
with the efforts of the General Partner to obtain a protective order or other remedy to 
protect the Partnership Information. If a protective order or other remedy cannot be 
obtained, such Limited Partner shall disclose only that Partnership Information that its 
counsel advises in writing (which writing shall also be addressed and delivered to the 
Partnership) that it is legally required to disclose. 
(c) 
Each Limited Partner shall promptly notify the General Partner if it becomes aware of 
any reason, whether under law, regulation, policy or otherwise, that it will. or might 
become compelled to. use the Partnership Information other than as contemplated by 
Olendoner Accem Secondary Opportunities IV (U.S.). L.P.
