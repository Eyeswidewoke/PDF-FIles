• Hi. 
> -tonight I think you eat the left over pork stir fry and ty will eat pasta and 
meatballs. 
> -do you want to invite the Crawford's (iincluding ethan) over sat Dec 22? Maybe 
another couple I'm just not sure who. Or more? I'd be up for 3 couples. 
> -I want to discuss last night. I really think it could have been handled 
differently. I don't know what you discussed with 'Wafter I went to bed. I 
would like to know. I think ty deserved to talk with his friends for 20 min(when 
they are all 'on line' also 8:30-8:50pm) then study and read in bed to fall 
asleep.. Giving ty a little bit of space is not a bad thing. He will be a 
happier person for it. We demanded of him a lot yesterday and he got no reward 
(reward in his eyes would be 20 min to chat with his friends). He deserves it. 
We need perameters. If he got to chat he would then have to study. 
> Throwing a $1200 phone out the door does not show ty good judgment, behavior or 
a great way of handling a situation. I realize you were trying to make a point 
but had it broken or froze-then what?. almost threw the big flash light into 
our foyer and would have thrown it hard too. I'm glad he had the sense not to do 
it. (But after watching you it would be hard to blame him) Another thing- we 
are always on top of 
to get himself organized with friends and that is what he 
wanted to do. Make dates to do stuff after school this week. This being said he 
also needs to allot time for homework and studying. Managing being a good parent 
is hard and I think you do a great job most the time. But last night was not 
good. What was the end result last night? I gave IN his phone this morning as 
we left the house. He seemed in good spirits. And he liked the chocolate Chex 
cereal. We had that already (I did not buy it yesterday) I think he must have not 
seen it last week. It is low in sugar
