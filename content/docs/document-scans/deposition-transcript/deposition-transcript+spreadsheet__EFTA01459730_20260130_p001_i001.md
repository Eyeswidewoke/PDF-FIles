Focus Europe: Dark clouds. no storm yet 
Central Banks & Financial Forecasts 
Euro Area 
We expect a 10bp deposit rate cut in March. Unless data surprise to the upside, 
a temporary acceleration in QE seems likely. If data surprise to the downside, 
this might not even be a front-loading but an increase in the QE envelope. The 
ECB also has an opportunity to think about a negative rate shield. 
UK 
We recently updated our call. Our view of liftoff in May 2016 was becoming 
difficult to justify with inflation rising slowly, wages disappointing, growth 
slower and financial markets fragile. We now see the first hike in November. 
Switzerland 
The SNB left policy on hold at its last meeting with rates well below zero. We 
see further gradual depreciation of CHF vs. EUR going forward. 
Sweden 
In December, the Riksbank left its rates profile broadly unchanged, suggesting 
rates will remain sub-zero until end-2017. 
Norway 
Norges Bank surprised with a rate cut in September. We expect a final further 
25bp rate cut this quarter. 
Denmark 
Denmark was forced to cut its deposit rate four times last year, 10bp of which 
was reversed in January (to -0.65%). We expect the DKK ERMII peg to hold. 
Po 
The NBP cut by 50bps at the March meeting and signaled the easing cycle had 
ended. We see rates on hold for the coming quarters with the longer-term 
outlook complicated by the appointment of a new MPC in early 2016. 
Hungary 
The NBH signaled that the easing cycle is now over and that the policy rate 
will remain at the current level for a very long time. We do not expect any rate 
hikes before 2017. 
Czech Republic 
The CNB recently confirmed it had intervened to defend the 27/EUR floor. With 
sterilization costs minimal and intervention probably modest, we expect the 
floor is here to stay for the coming quarters.
