Hello Jeffrey, finally a letter. 
I found some progress and am very excited about it, even though it's not going to 
be so easy, all right nothing is easy. 
As you know I was working here all this year, of course not so good, because I 
was excluded from my university before my trip to USA, and I didn't have an 
education, but still. SO, in January I found some place to continue my studies and 
after all application and exam processes, they were ready to give me a student 
loan, (not they, but the representative office in Tashkent) and the university begins 
at March, 28. so it's going to last 4 semesters (half year each) until I (hopefully) 
will graduate. It is in Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, and it gives 2 diplomas, one is 
Malaysian and the second one in English of Staffordshire university. As far as 
english education is very expensive, they give the same program and diploma, but 
at much lower prices. The cost of year is 6800 $. And there is no visa for Uzbek 
people to Malaysia, so I am happy to move a little bit forward, because this hell 
what I was seeing here all those months was unbelievable. 
But, nonetheless, I need to cover that loan and my own expenses for 
accommodation and life, but they don't give a right to work there. I have one plan, 
to ask my friend from NY to help me with modelling, you know 1 was not 
interested and supportive for that, but it is the only way to have some better life. 
I'm just tired of restricting and limiting myself to a better life because of what-
people-say, parents, etc. But there is a lot of cons there also. But he told that I can 
have some contracts while I study, and even London in summer. THE MAIN good 
point is that, if I will somehow succeed in that, I can get US visa for models HI-B 
because it will probably cover my previous violations and finally I will be happy to 
come to New York. 
I want your notion about it, how do you think, is it the way I should go, or not. I 
know nobody will tell me the truth as you will (your voice: "GULSUM, TELL 
THE TRUTH!" appeared in my head) :) 
As about us to meet, Jeffrey, dear, I want it always! But, I told you how many problems 
our country causes to us. Every new stupid rule is "better" than previous one. It is 
very hard to get visa for young and single girl here, they just dont give it without 
reason. But I can visit Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Russia, 
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan. Much easier is 
with other countries, like Turkey, India, Great Britain etc, but Schengen
