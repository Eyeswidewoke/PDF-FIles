Re: 
if ,you are not to blame for what happend„ in this case„ who is?. THAT=IS MY POINT> you cant avoid it- It is as a direct 
result of your many p=or choices. yours and yours alone., . I am not disciplining you. you have =ot been punished, 
sentenced or penalized by me, I love you and it pains=me to see this.. when people suggest you treat me with the same 
degree of =areless reckless poor judgment that you have treated balle , no one sugges=s you are not loyal or do not love 
either. THe reality is that your vie= of things are skewed,the facts of your actions and the results of your=behavior, are i 
hope easier to see with Balle. I have been by your side fo= years , I am the most loyal friend you could ever hope to 
have, i have ta=en you from a girl with not even a high school education and did my best t= guide you to adulthood. You 
refused to meet what i said my needs were,=nd continued to follow your own choices, nagging nagging, nagging, and 
con=inuing in the face of reality to fabricate an illusory, view of your actu=l help.. I am hoping that the BAII-e situation 
clarifies your role. In her=case , if you were to tell her, but last year i was loyal and stood by yo=r cage when you were 
sick, and you know i love you. JUST look in her ey=s, -you ignored Jefffreys advice re peabo. i know you care , but that is 
n=t enough, your actions are directly responsible for what has happned . you= actions , not your motivations , your 
actions

I don't know how our recollection of events can be so different. 
You left to NYC and didn't answer your phone when she was giving birth =hile Story stayed on the phone with 
me throughout the night. I was terrifi=d about anything going wrong and I made decisions not based on Story's=opinion, 
but the vet's. I hope we can at least agree I absolutely want=d to do what was best for Ball-e and had no other 
motivation. You made no =ecisions, waited for the result of mine and then lectured me about what I =id wrong. Well, at 
that point I could see it for myself and don't need=anyone to point out the mistakes. Regarding Fatt-e you were 
unfortunately =gain not available during the critical moments and I had to make decisions=by myself about where to 
take her and what to do. You clearly had no contr=l over it and I am not suggesting you left me without help on purpose. 
You=were very helpful and kind once you landed. I did the best I could and the=e was nothing irresponsible or reckless 
about my decisions. I do feel guil=y for not being home for the few hours before you left when something happ=nded to 
Fatt-e. 
For the record, I am not suggesting you are responsible for anything that h=ppend with the dogs at all. They 
were fully my responsibility. You were no= involved and I realize the mistakes that were made. What I am saying is t=at 
you are not in a position to discipline me about it or blame me for wha= happened
