credible allegation worthy of investigation. I believe that our initial d=scussion was sufficient to settle this matter. 
Whether or not y=u agree with this, there are two things I thi=k are important to establish. 
Firstly,=b> that the University should not propagate what can be false 
all=gations from such a source by presenting them directly to current and/or f=rmer employees or to others. To do so 
would be to further their libe=ous agenda, as Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard, I would ap=reciate seeing 
copies of the correspondence you might send to current or f=rmer employees about this in the process of carrying out 
and concluding yo=r investigation. 
Secondly, I reiterate once a=ain that the Origins Project environment is 
supportive, candid, frank, hon=st, and productive, with all employees being treated with respect, as well=as being 
supported and mentored. I am proud of our team, and I believe the= feel the same way. 
Thanks for your attention to these letters. 
Lawrence=Krauss

Dea= Ms. Saadiq: 
My name is Adam Waldman, an= I am Professor Lawrence Krauss' litigation 
counsel. Earlier=this week, I sent the attached letter to Buzzfeed via one of their reporte=s named Peter Aldhous. 
<=iv style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:12pt;font-family:"Times=New 
Roman",serif">l am also in receipt of Mr. Aldhous' letter to ASU, wh=ch is a variation on defamation — both libel and 
slander —=that Mr. Aldhous and his colleagues have been manufacturing for at least 6=months (notably without any 
reporting) in a campaign with a purpose known =nly to them. Buzzfeed's first method is to call or write thi=d parties, 
posit a list of fake, anonymous, recklessly false and malicious="allegations," and ask if the third party has anything to 
=dd. Buzzfeed's second method is to seek tortious interferenc= with Professor Krauss' professional contracts, by writing 
third p=rties with whom Professor Krauss is in privity, present a similarly inflam=atory series of anonymous, recklessly 
false and malicious accusations, and=then question: how can the email's recipient allow such a person t= serve on their 
board, or speak at their conference? The letter from=Buzzfeed to the University falls into both categories. There will be 
appro=riate legal consequences for Buzzfeed's actions. </a 
It is my understanding that your of=ice believes it is compelled by the above to 
investigate false, defamatory= anonymous accusations posited by the online tabloid Buzzfeed by contactin= third parties 
and potentially rebroadcasting the tabloid Buzzfeed*=99s accusations. To be clear, these accusations were not made 
to the=University by actual human beings who are alleging they were victims.0=A0 There is no evidence they were 
presented to Buzzfeed by actual human be=ngs. Moreover, no present or former employees of ASU have made any such 
al=egations to your office, or to any office at ASU, to our knowledge. They a=e simply alleged by a tabloid, and one that 
had yet published a "s=ory" on the topic when they forwarded these to you. You may pro=ose to rebroadcast this 
tabloid's libel to other third parties who hav= also made no accusation against Professor Krauss. I suggest that yo= 
consult with the University's counsel before taking so rash a ste= as re-broadcasting hearsay defamation that came to 
you via an online tabl=id under these circumstances. 
Professor Krauss and I both recognize the absolute need to investiga=e real 
allegations. Some of the women who have bravely come forward =ith personal harassment allegations against Harvey 
Weinstein are my client= and friends. Some of these victims have been advised by me. T=ose actual allegations are 
entirely distinct from a tabloid attempting to =anufacture allegations to create harm.

Sincerely, 
Adam Wa=dman
