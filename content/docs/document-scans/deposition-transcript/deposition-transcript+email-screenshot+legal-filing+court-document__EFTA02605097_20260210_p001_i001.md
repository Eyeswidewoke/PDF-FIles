Dear Friends, 
I have been involved with the =unior Tennis Champion Center (JTCC) a non-profit S01(c)3 organization 
=ased in College Park, Maryland, for the past three years. I have =rained at JTCC on a number of occasions, and this 
summer I am =ontinuing my mission to work with their Community Outreach Manager to =ntroduce tennis to youth and 
adults of all ages and to develop their =kills in a the lifetime =port. 
JTCC provides opportunities to =hildren of all demographics and backgrounds. It was very personally 
=ulfilling to work again with the Community Outreach program, as JTCC =ends its own coaches, players and equipment 
to elementary schools and =ecreation centers in underserved neighborhoods in the greater =ashington D.C. area. Since 
its inception in 2009, the program has =ntroduced tennis to over 4,000 children between the ages of five and =welve. 
Over 100 of the most talented and motivated players from =he Community Outreach have been invited 
at no cost to join JTCC =rograms in College Park, Maryland. They are put on a tennis pathway =ith the aim of producing 
graduates who earn a tennis scholarship to =lay at a Division I college. A top-level coaching team monitors the 
=rogression of each player at every stage of their development. The =ombination of tennis and academic instruction has 
led to many success =tories. In the last seven years, 85 JTCC graduates have earned =ivision I tennis scholarships worth 
eight million dollars in value, 11 =tudents have gone on to play tennis for an Ivy League University and 18 =raduates 
have represented Division III college teams. 
The sport of tennis teaches an =ndividual to be a self-sufficient problem solver, but as we all know it =an 
lead to being self-centered. JTCC believes strongly that their =layers must learn to "give back" to the community by 
=oaching tennis at Community Outreach sites. Participants in JTCC'= Champions program are required contribute at least 
30 hours of their =ime each year, providing free tennis instruction at sites in =nderserved areas. They are responsible for 
helping mentor and coach =hose at the start of their own tennis journeys. 
As I mentioned above, JTCC is a =01(c)3 organization and needs to generate charitable donations. They 
=ave a very appealing business model that depends on only a third of =heir revenue from charitable contributions. This 
means that your =onations will be used entirely for community outreach and aid kids who =ave been vetted for real 
financial need. My goal this year is to raise =100,000(last year i raised $60,000 with your help) for these amazing =ids. 
With your help I can make this mission a reality. If you would =ike to send a donation please send it to JTCC 5200 
Campus Drive =ollege PARK, MD 20740 attention Ray Benton.
