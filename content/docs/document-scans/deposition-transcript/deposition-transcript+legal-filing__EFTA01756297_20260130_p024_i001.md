<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">All that is now anc=ent history in states like Bahrain, Saudi 
Arabia, and the UAE. Saudi offic=als have taken a particularly aggressive stance. According to a leaked U.S= diplomatic 
cable from 2008, the Saudi 
king has "repeatedly exhorted the United States to cut off the head of t=e snake" -- Iran's nuclear weapons program. 
Another cable from the sam= year quoted a veteran Saudi minister for foreign affairs suggesting a U.S= or NATO 
offensive in southern Lebanon 
to end Iran-backed Hezbollah's grip on power there. And a former Saudi i=telligence chief has said publicly that Saudi 
Arabia should "consider ac=uiring nuclear weapons to counter Iran."</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">In early 2011, Bahr=in's rulers took full advantage of anti-Iranian 
sentiments to act agains= domestic opponents, announcing that they would deport all Shia residents =ho had "links to 
Hezbollah and Iran's 
Revolutionary Guard." In practice, that meant expelling hundreds of Bahr=in's Lebanese residents, suspending all flights 
between the capital Manama=and Beirut, and warning Bahraini nationals not to travel to Lebanon due to="threats and 
interference by terrorists."</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Abu Dhabi's attit=de toward Iran originally appeared to have 
been more hesitant, perhaps bec=use of its previous ruler's more moderate policies. According to a 2006 =able from the 
U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, 
the UAE government told U.S. officials that "the threat from al-Qaeda wo=ld be minor compared to if Iran had 
nukes...but that it was reluctant to t=ke any action that might provoke its neighbor." Nevertheless, as Abu Dha=i's 
forceful Crown Prince Muhammad bin 
Zayed al-Nahyan and his five full brothers gained control over most of the=country's foreign policy, the emirate's views 
have fallen in line with=those of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Since 2007, the crown prince's circle=has pushed Western 
officials to put more 
troops in the region to counter Iranian hegemony. In 2009, the crown princ= forcefully&nbsp;</span><span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Qatar, which has so=ght a role as regional peace broker, has 
been more careful with its public=statements on Iran. Even so, in a private meeting in 2009, Qatar's then =rime minister 
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim 
bin Taber al-Thani, characterized Qatar's relationship with Iran as one =n which "they lie to us and we lie to them." 
Qatar's calculated dipl=macy perhaps owes to its precarious balancing act: the country hosts major=U.S. military 
facilities while sharing 
its largest gas resource -- the offshore North Field -- with Iran.</span><=p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Perhaps even riskie= than their hawkishness toward Iran is the 
Gulf monarchies' dovishness t=ward Israel. Since independence, the Gulf monarchies have upheld laws requ=ring 
government personnel, businesses, 
and even individual residents to boycott Israel. In the UAE, the federal g=vernment has always housed an Israel boycott 
office. One federal law, pass=d in 1971, stipulates that "any natural or legal person shall be prohibi=ed from directly or 
indirectly concluding 
an agreement with organizations or persons either resident in Israel, conn=cted therewith by virtue of their nationality 
of working on its behalf."=/span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">For many years, how=ver, the boycott extended well beyond 
such restrictions. The state-owned t=lecommunications company has barred telephone calls to Israel and blocked =eb 
sites with an Israeli suffix. The 
government has not permitted Israeli nationals to enter the UAE, nor -- in=theory -- any visitors that possess Israeli visa 
stamps in their passports= Yet trade opportunities have occasionally prompted the UAE to ignore its =wn boycott. After 
joining the World 
Trade Organization in 1996, UAE authorities were clearly under pressure to=drop or at least relax their stance. When 
Dubai agreed to host the WTO's a=nual meeting in 2003, delegations from all of the organization's member st=tes had to 
be invited; there was
