As I have explained, the marital trust was set up many years ago on the assumption that the funds would be 
available both to Carol and me, and to the survivor -- which we took for granted would be Carol, which is why it is in her 
name. After I appointed you as trustee a few years ago, you certainly have the legal right to determine whether funds 
should be available, even for partial tax payments as in this case. 
I am indeed surprised, in fact shocked, that you feel that you cannot permi= a small payment from the marital 
trust -- even less that what I was providi=g annually as distributions and for Alex's health care -- without insisti=g on 
some professional supervision of my financial affairs. It of cours= never would have occurred to me over the years to 
ask for anything similar.=br> 
That is the sole issue. Nothing else. We take care of our own financial affairs, just as you do of yours. It is no 
one else's c=ncern. The marital trust, and that alone, is your proper concern, since the time when I appointed you as 
trustee. I will not ask for anything further from the marital trust, and there is no reason for you to ask again to be 
involved in our financial affairs.

Dear Doddoy, 
It sounds like you are very angry about my decision yesterday, and I'm deeply sorry that it has come to this. I 
still hope that we can sit down at a meeting someday and resolve this. I'd like to use the f=nds from the marital trust to 
support you, but I can't do that without some understanding of your overall financial picture. If we were to meet with 
any professional advisor of your choosing, I'm confident we could work out a plan that ensures your long-term solvency 
and comfort, helps Valeria after your death, and uses the marital trust in a way that we both agree is reasonable and 
sustainable. It would be up to you how much detail to share with me at this meeting and how much to keep private. 
The more I understand your circumstances, the better I can fill my role as trustee. 
You are sending me mixed signals about whether you want me involved in your financial affairs or not. Several 
times you've declared that your own IRA is plenty, you are managing fine without using the marital trust, and you don't 
want to discuss it with me anymore. But yest=rday you came to me out of the blue, demanded a six-figure sum on three 
hours L; notice, and reacted angrily when I insisted on taking time to discuss it first. You can't have it both ways. I am 
the trustee for pa=t of your assets, like it or not, and you have to decide whether to include me in a genuine ongoing 
conversation (with professional advice) about your finances, or forgo your access to this money. I'd like to know wh=ch 
it is going to be. Please don't ask for further trust distributio=s until we have begun a conversation. I will be ready for 
the conversat=on anytime you like.

It's hard to express my feelings about your unwillingness to permit the marital account to contribute to the 
taxes, or the demand for inspection and review of our financial affairs. 
Hardly the pattern for many years, but we will manage on our own.
