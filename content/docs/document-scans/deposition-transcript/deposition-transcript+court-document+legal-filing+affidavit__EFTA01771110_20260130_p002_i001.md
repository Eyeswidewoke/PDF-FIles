1. 
Investment type: 
Due to the investment restrictions of t=e Li Ka Shing Foundation ("Foundation"), we would require the agreement to 
expressly exc=ude gambling or alcohol-related investments unless written approval is obtained. The restrictions on 
gambling and alcohol related investments [will) be included. It is&nbs=;anticipated that investments would be made 
solely in the internet/social media sector. 
2. 
Commitment: 
a) 
Please clarify whether the commitment paid by investors is =o be paid entirely upfront or based on a capital call 
format via the subscription of =articipating Preference Shares ("PPS"). The commitment is to be paid by investors in full 
upfront. 
b) &=bsp; Annual budget of the Company or running costs of the joint =enture vehicle (whichever applicable) should 
be subject to a cap and the investor&=8217;s total commitment should be capped at the originally agreed total initial 
commitment per investor. &nb=p; There should be a timeline for the return of commitment to =he investor if the 
investor's commitment is not used within a certain pe=iod of time, if applicable.&nb=p;=o:p> 1= is intended that the fund 
will be fully invested inside =12) months, ideally 6 months. 
=/span>Distribution: 
a) 
There is currently no definite timeframe as to when an inve=tor will be able to receive a distribution as this 
depends upon when the Company can= realize capital gains. Please elaborate on the exit mechanism of investors =nd a 
long stop date whereby the initial commitment is to be returned e.g. buy ba=k of the PPS at a designated price if it is not 
invested. There should be a mini=um IRR hurdle of at least 8% return on the commitment invested. Capital and/or 
distributions on investments will be returned to investors as soon as =strong>each investment is realised, whether 
through an IPO or other exit. In the event that the Company still retains an investment(s) [= years) from the date that 
investors paid their commit=ent, then 
We are instructed that 30% carry on profits after the recur= of initial capital is 
rather high. 
Investment Criteria for Projects:<=p> 
There should be an IRR hurdle of at least 8% for investment=. It is not anticipated for there to be a minimum IRR hurdle 
on the commitment invested. 
b)<=pan style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman"> 
There should be a capital limit per transaction for investm=nts. It is 
not anticipated for there to be a capital limit per transaction for= investments. 
Investor's Rights: 
a) 
We understand that the investor will be investing as a PPS =older which does not carry any voting rights or board 
control. Please however cla=ify the investor's rights as an observer e.g. reporting obligations of th= Company, rights of 
investors to receive financial reports, rights to inspection and =he right to control the Company upon the occurrence of 
certain events or reach=ng of a certain timeframe. There will be quarterly report= produced for investors providing 
details on the investments made and the financial position of the company. It is not anticip=ted for investors to have 
any contingent control right= over the company. 
b) &nb=p; Please clarify whether there will be any liquidation prefer=nce to the PPS holders. A Participating 
Preference Share takes=priority (and so has preference) over an ordinary share in the event of a =iquidation event. 
As per Jason's email earlier today, the Foundation's =ttributable interest in the vehicle cannot exceed 20% at any time. 
We would therefore require there to be a pre-agreed transfer mechanism in the event that the 2=% is exceeded in 
future for any reasons, such that the Foundation's shareholding=in the vehicle will be transferred to any other entity as
