S-I/A 
compensation committee will receive an annual fee of $5,000; and 
• the chairman of our nominating and corporate governance committee will receive an annual fee of $10,000, and other 
members of our nominating and corporate governance committee will receive an annual fee of 52,500. 
Non-employee directors will not receive per meeting attendance fees for attending meetings of our board of directors or its 
committees. The chairperson of a committee will not be paid the additional annual cash retainer for service as a member of that 
committee. 
Subject to any limits under our 2015 Plan, each non-employee director may elect to convert his or her cash compensation 
under the non-employee director policy into an award of RSUs under our 2015 Plan. If the non-employee director makes this 
election in a timely manner in accordance with the policy, each such award of RSUs will be granted on the same date as the 
corresponding cash compensation otherwise would be paid under the policy, will have a grant-date fair value (determined under 
GAAP) equal to the aggregate amount of such cash compensation, and will be fully vested on the grant date. 
Subject to any limits in our 2015 Plan, each person who first becomes a non-employee director will receive an initial grant of 
RSUs on the date of his or her appointment having a grant-date fair value (determined under GAAP) equal to $250,000 multiplied 
by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is (x) 12 minus (y) the number of months between the date of the last annual meeting and 
the date the non-employee director becomes a member of our board of directors and (ii) the denominator of which is 12 (unless his 
or her appointment to our board of directors occurs on the date of an annual meeting of our stockholders), each continuing non-
employee director will receive an annual grant of RSUs on the date of each annual meeting having a grant-date fair value 
(determined under GAAP) of $250.000, and each lead independent director will receive an annual grant of RSUs on the date of 
each annual meeting having a grant-date fair value (determined under GAAP) of $70,000. Each initial grant, annual grant, and lead 
independent director grant will be granted under our 2015 Plan and vest upon the earlier of the next annual meeting of our 
stockholders following the grant date or the one-year anniversary of the grant date, subject to the non-employee director's 
continued service with us through such date. 
The awards granted to a non-employee director under the policy will become fully vested upon a "change in control" as 
defined in our 2015 Plan.
