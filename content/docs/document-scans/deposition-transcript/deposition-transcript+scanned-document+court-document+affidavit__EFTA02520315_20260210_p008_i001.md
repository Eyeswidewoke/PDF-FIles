In your email you mentioned that one staffer resigned after I =nvited Krauss on 
the Galapagos cruise. I'm not aware of any =taffer resigning because of that. If you give me a name I could comment =n 
the reasons for the staffer leaving. Ms. Beauchamp remained an =mployee of CFI (and went on the Galapagos cruise 
with =rauss). 
You mentioned also the =omments that were made to me in March 2012 by 
Melody Hensley. Let me =ive you the background for that. CFI was holding an event prior to the =012 Reason Rally in DC. 
Richard Dawkins, Jessica Alquist, Jamie Raskin, =nd Lawrence Krauss were scheduled to speak at the event. Melody 
Hensley =as heavily involved in the planning for the event and in fact was =apped to make introductions for the 
speakers, including Krauss. (At the =ime she was in charge of the DC local branch.) During the planning for =he event she 
gave no indication whatsoever that she had any hesitation =bout introducing or dealing with Krauss. (I will forward you 
some email =orrespondence confirming this.) 
As I recall, Krauss's=schedule resulted in his planned arrival being a little later 
than the =thers. As it turned out, he was even further delayed. At some point =hen it became clear that Krauss was 
going to be late, Hensley turned to =e and said, "I know why Krauss isn't coming; he's=embarrassed to see me." I asked 
Hensley what she meant by this. =he said Krauss had made a pass at her several years earlier and she had rebuffed him. 
I asked for some details. She said she was in a hotel room =ith him (I can't recall whether she said it was Krauss's =otel 
room, but I think it was), and that Krauss tried to kiss her. She =ushed him away and said she wasn't interested. I asked if 
=rauss persisted; she said he did not. Thinking out loud, I believe I =aid something to the effect of 'well, if you want to 
make a =omplaint you probably can, although I'm not sure our policy at =hat time would cover that.' Ms. Hensley said 
she was not =nterested in making a formal complaint. 
Ms. Hensley's statement that I "responded to =er with silence" is absolutely 
false and I categorically and =nqualifiedly deny it. We talked about her concern, as indicated. Ms. =ensley's recall must 
be failing her. 
Given the passage of time (six years), the fact that Hensley =id not want to 
pursue the matter, the fact that Krauss desisted when =ensley indicated she wasn't interested, the fact that Hensley 
=idn't even seem very bothered by the incident (as indicated, =he had expressed no hesitation in seeing Krauss), and the 
fact that we =ad no policy covering conduct by nonemployees back in 2006 (in fact, =FI's zero-tolerance policy covering 
employees themselves was =ot implemented until 2007, I believe -- I was just hired as the =ttorney in July 2006), I 
decided not to do any further about this =articular incident. However, the incident, along with observations I =eard at 
the Women in Secularism conference which we held later in the =pring of 2012 (observations which didnotmention 
Krauss, but rather some speakers at non-CFI =vents), was a factor in my thinking about the need for a policy =overing 
conduct by invited speakers and guests at CFI =onferences. 
Ms. Hensley made no other =omplaint to me about Krauss, nor did she ever 
express to me her belief =hat we should not invite Krauss to events. 
In closing, let me state that any accusations stating that I =eglected to take 
harassment complaints seriously are false. =urthermore, I would regard them as a malicious attack on my character =nd 
my professional reputation. 
Sincerely, 
Ronald A. =indsay
