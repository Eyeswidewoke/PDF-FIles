Subject Dr Victor 
I would like to bring to your attention a very unpleasant experience that I had at Dr Victors 
practice today. 
I had an appointment for my laser hair removal. I was taken into the consulting room by a lady I 
had never met before. Already on the way in I asked her if I could please use the restroom and 
was told that she would first take me to the room and speak to me, once she was done, I could 
use the restroom. 
In the consulting room she informed me that I could choose one area that I would like to have 
lasered, as they have a new policy that they only do one area per month. ie I could have my 
underarms done today and would have to come back in I month to have my legs done. 
I respect that they have a new policy regarding their laser machine and understand that their 
policies need to be adhered to. However, the way that this information was conveyed to me was 
appalling. She was aggressive, abrasive, and defensive, at one point telling me that I cant just 
come in and expect to use the laser whenever I want to and not give other people a chance to use 
it. 
In order to make my decision I told her that I had not yet had my legs in the sun this summer but 
would be going in the sun soon and asked how long after the treatment it would be safe to go in 
the sun. She responded that she could not answer such a question as they never recommend 
anyone to go in the sun. My question seemed a fairly normal question to ask a dermatologist, but 
she would not accommodate it. 
She left and Susan/Suzanne came in to do the laser. I told Susan that I was quite shocked and 
would like to speak to Dr Victor before I went ahead with the laser. Susan left the room and the 
lady from before came back and said that I could not speak to Dr Victor and asked me to leave, 
as the room I was in was booked for the next patient. I replied that I was going to wait until I 
could speak to Dr Victor and she told me to wait in the waiting room. When I went into the 
waiting room the receptionist told me I could go back into the consulting room area and wait for 
Dr Victor. 
Dr Victor confirmed that they could only treat one area with the laser at a time. We went into a 
consulting room to discuss the concerns I have about my acne since I have been off accutane (I 
had requested to speak to him regarding this when I made the appointment I week ago.) The lady 
returned and off course behaved in a somewhat better manner around him. She seemed to not 
remember so clearly the discussion we had had earlier about the sun. At this point I had had 
enough, I was annoyed and did not want to talk to Dr Victor about my skin concerns with 
someone who had behaved so unpleasantly present (I understand that he has to have a nurse with 
him during his consultations so felt it would be inappropriate for me to ask for privacy with him). 
As I mentioned, I was very annoyed, I said that I would be in contact with you and walked out of 
the room.
