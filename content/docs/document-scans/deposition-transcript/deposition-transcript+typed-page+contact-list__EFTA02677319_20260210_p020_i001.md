Although there were good American writers before them. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David 
Thoreau set the tone for a distinctly American contribution to world literature. Paradoxically, they 
did so by abandoning nationalism in favor of attention to nature and the cosmos, the minutely 
particular and the abstract universal. Quintessentially American in their individualism self-
motivation. and optimism, they are also uncannily un•American In their refusal of consensus, their 
dislike of Rotarian 'socializing. and their unwillingness to court unpopularity as the result of 
conviction, especially as regards the wrong of slavery and the tensions that eventually led to the 
US Civil War. The movement they led, called Transcendentalism; was admired. transformed or 
mocked by their fellow American writers. including Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Sarah 
Ome Jewett. and Louisa May Alcott. and we will read fiction and criticism by writers along with the 
essays. poems, and meditations of Emerson and Thoreau. We will also examine these American 
writers' relation to European Romanticism and how Transcendentalism operated in other media. 
such as music and especially painting. Our central text will be Thoreau's Walden. his memorable 
account of a year living alone in the New England woods.

This course takes up the story of anglophone poetry in the late 19th century, tracking not only 
major work from the U.K and the US.. but also from cultures emancipating themselves from 
British colonialism (Ireland, the Caribbean, West Africa. India. Canada, Australia). The big story is 
the shift from metrical poetry to free verse, especially in the High Modernist period. Then

Faculty: Monroe, Melissa

04:00 PM - 06:40 PM 
Credits: 3 
CRN 6951 Sec A 
One of the defining characteristics of modernist literature is its linguistic self-consciousness and 
Its engagement with the fact that we live in 'a world made of words.' In this course, we examine the 
work of twentieth-century writers who violate linguistic norms in order to question social, 
psychological and philosophical norms. These violations raise questions about the role of the 
individual in society, challenge the notion of a stable. cohesive sell, and break down accepted 
category distinctions such as concrete/abstract and real/Imaginary. We focus on the ways in which 
each author's linguistic disruptions embody the thematic concerns of his or her work. We read 
theorists such as H.P. Grice, John Searle. Roman Jakobson and Tzvetanrodorov; major literary 
figures such as Samuel Beckett. William Faulkner. Gertrude Stein, Paul Celan, Franz Kafka, Alain 
Robbe-Grillet and Wallace Stevens: and contemporaries such as Lydia Davis, Stephen Dixon and 
James Kelman. Permission required from the instructor with the exception of BA/MA students.
