On Jan. 30, 1991, t=o weeks after the beginning of the Gulf War, the German government agreed =o supply Israel with 
armaments worth 1.2 billion deutsche marks. This incl=ded the complete financing of two submarines with 880 million 
deutsche marks. The budgetary miracle had come to pass. l=rael had found its benefactor. 
According to milita=y wisdom, a country that buys one or two submarines will also buy a third =ne. One submarine is 
usually in dock, while the other two take turns being=deployed during operations. "After we had ordered the first two 
boats, it was clear that we had entered into = deal which would involve repeat orders," says an individual who was = 
member of the Israeli cabinet at the time. 
On a winter's day i= 1994, at about 6 p.m., an Israeli Air Force plane landed in the military =rea of Cologne-Bonn Airport. 
Its passengers wanted to discuss the future o= Israel and the Middle East. On board were the then Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin, his national security adviser =nd then Mossad chief Shabtai Shavit. The small delegation was driven to th= 
chancellor's residence, where Kohl was waiting with his foreign policy adviser, Joachim Bitterlich, and his intelligence 
coordinator, Bernd Schmidbauer. 
Wheat Beer for Isra=l 
On that evening, Ko=I and Rabin discussed the path to peace in the Middle East. Rabin and Pale=tinian leader Yasser 
Arafat had been jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize=the year before, together with Peres. For the first time in a long 
time, conciliation seemed possible between th= Jews and the Palestinians, with Germany serving as a middleman. 
In Bonn, Rabin spok= at length about the German-Israeli relationship, which was still difficul=. At dinner, Kohl surprised 
his visitors by serving wheat beer. The Israel=s were delighted. "The beer tastes great," Rabin said. The ice had been 
broken. 
On that evening, th= Israeli premier asked the Germans for a third submarine, and Kohl spontan=ously agreed. At 
around midnight, Schmidbauer took Rabin back to airport. =ohl, who was virtually unsurpassed in the art of male 
bonding in politics, sent a case of wheat beer to Israe= for Christmas in 1994. 
A few months after =he secret meeting in Bonn, in February 1995, the contract for the third su=marine, the Tekumah, 
was signed. The German share of the costs totaled 220=million deutsche marks. 
THE WELL-PROTECTED =ECRETS OF THE SHIPYARD IN KIEL 
Since then, one of =he most secretive arms projects in the Western world has been underway in =iel, where a special 
form of bonding between the German and the Israeli pe=ple developed. Around half a dozen Israelis work at the 
shipyard today on a long-term basis. Friendships, som= of them close, have formed between HDW engineers and their 
families and t=e Israeli families, and special occasions are celebrated together. But des=ite these friendships, the Israelis 
always make sure that no outsiders are allowed near the submarines. Even m=nagers from Thyssen-Krupp, which 
bought HDW in 2005, are denied access. &q=ot;The main goal of everyone involved was to ensure that there would be 
no=public debate about the project, neither in Israel nor in Germany," says former Israeli navy chief Ayalon. Thi= 
explains why everything related to the equipment on the ships remains hid=en behind a veil of secrecy. 
One of the special =eatures is the equipment used in the Dolphin class, which is named after t=e first ship. Unlike 
conventional submarines, the Dolphins don't just have=torpedo tubes with a 533-millimeter diameter in the steel bow. 
In response to a special Israeli request, the H=W engineers designed four additional tubes that are 650 millimeters in 
dia=eter -- a special design not found in any other submarine in the Western w=rld. 
What is the purpose=of the large tubes? In a classified 2006 memo, the German government argue= that the tubes are 
an "option for the transfer of special forces and=the pressure-free stowage of their equipment" -- combat swimmers, for 
example --, who can be released through the narrow=shaft for secret operations. The same explanation is given by the 
Israelis=
