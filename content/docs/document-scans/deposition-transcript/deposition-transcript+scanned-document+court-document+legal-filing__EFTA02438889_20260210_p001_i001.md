This is appalling. We knew he was writing a piece and spent a lot of time underlining the achievements of DW and being 
assured you were not being singled out - that it was a piece about all 1111's lieutenants. Your insight into what is behind it 
is illuminating. 
David will do a great job in damage control, and your work with NY Times and Telegraph in London is also vital. But a 
meeting with Murdoch would help prevent these before they even begin. Let's aim to set that up sooner rather than later.

Dubai Inc. Needs Change at the Top• By ANDREW CRITCHLOW Faced with a continuing financial crisis of savage 
proportions. Dubai risks retreating into its past rather than facing up to its new reality. The Gulf emirate needs to radically 
overhaul its state-controlled companies if it is to overcome its S80 billion mountain of debt. Yet rather than seize the 
opportunity to introduce international standards of governance and transparency, the people whose poor judgment led 
Dubai to the brink have kept their jobs. For western lenders with billions of dollars still at stake, that is troubling.Take 
Dubai World, the conglomerate that has just been radically restructured after running up almost S60 billion of liabilities on 
an ill-judged acquisition spree. Its deals included buying struggling Madison Avenue retailer 13amcys for $800 million. 
investing in an $8.8 billion Las Vegas casino development and paying S100 million for the Queen Elizabeth II liner, which 
has since spent most of its time languishing in a Dubai dry dock.Dubai World has now cut its work force by 15% in an 
of
 to save $800 million over the next three years. Surprisingly, its senior managers remain in place, including Sultan 
bin Sulayem, the chairman who masterminded the expansion. That has disappointed bankers who fear that, unless senior 
managers are held more accountable, the mistakes of the past will be repeated.But holding senior Emirati officials like Mr. 
Sulayem responsible for their decisions will be tricky. The Sulaycm family's ties to Dubai's ruling Maktoums run deep. Mr. 
Sulayem's father was a key adviser to the family. The same is true of many other of the emirate's business leaders whose 
reputations have been damaged by the crisis.Wcstem lenders would rather sec experienced and suitably qualified
