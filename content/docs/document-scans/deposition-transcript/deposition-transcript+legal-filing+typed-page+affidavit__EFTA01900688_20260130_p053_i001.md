Court's March 29, 2012 ruling in Doe v. Jindal, 851 F. Supp. 2d 995 (E.D. La. 2012), in which 
the Court declared that Louisiana's sex offender registry law, which mandates sex offender 
registration by individuals convicted of violating the State's Crime Against Nature by 
Solicitation statute, but not those convicted for the identical sexual conduct under the 
Prostitution statute, deprived individuals of Equal Protection of the laws; the nine plaintiffs in 
Doe I have since been relieved by the State of their sex offender registration obligations. In this 
new lawsuit, the plaintiffs and proposed 1 class members now challenge the requirement that, 
notwithstanding Doe I, the State claims to be without the authority to act and they continue to 
face mandatory sex offender registration as a result of their convictions for Crime Against 
Nature by Solicitation. The facts underlying the Equal Protection challenge advanced in Doc I 
are more completely set forth in that opinion. Supp. 2d 995 (E.D. La. 2012).1 851 F. The 
Judgment, which was entered on April 11, 2012, provides in part: IT IS HEREBY 
DECLARED, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that: 1. The application of the 
Registration of Sex Offenders, Sexually Violent Predators, and Child I In Louisiana, the 
solicitation of oral or anal sex for compensation can be prosecuted under two statutes: the 
solicitation provision of the Prostitution statute and the Crime Against Nature by Solicitation 
statute. The solicitation provision of the Prostitution statute outlaws "[t]he solicitation by one 
person of another with the intent to engage in indiscriminate sexual intercourse with the latter 
for compensation." La.R.S. 14:82(AX2). The Prostitution statute defines "sexual intercourse" as 
"anal, oral, or vaginal sexual intercourse." La.R.S. 14:82(B). The Crime Against Nature by 
Solicitation statute forbids "solicitation by a human being of another with the intent to engage in 
any unnatural carnal copulation for compensation." La.R.S. 14:89.2(A). "Unnatural carnal 
copulation" is defined as oral or anal sexual intercourse. See, e.g., Louisiana v. Smith, 766 So.2d 
501, 504-05 (La. 2000). On February 15, 2011 nine plaintiffs, proceeding pseudonymously, sued 
the defendants in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to challenge the 
constitutionality of Louisiana's mandatory inclusion of one particular crime on the State's sex 
offender registry, the Crime Against Nature by Solicitation statute. This Court determined that 
there was no rational legislative purpose in requiring registration as a sex offender for persons 
convicted for violation of Crime Against Nature by Solicitation when conviction under the 
identical solicitation provision of Louisiana's Prostitution statute commanded no sex offender 
registration. See Doe I. 2 Predators law (Registry Law), La.R.S. § 15:540 et seq., to those 
convicted of Crime Against Nature by Solicitation under La.R.S. § 14:89(AX2) or La.R.S. § 
14:89.2(A), and their inclusion on the State Sex Offender & Child Predator Registry (SOCPR) 
pursuant to La.R.S. § 15:542, deprives them of equal protection of the laws in violation of the 
Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; 2. Defendants must cease and desist 
from placing any individuals convicted of Crime Against Nature by Solicitation under La.R.S. § 
14:89(A)(2) or La.R.S. § 14:89.2(A) on the SOCPR; 3. This Judgment and Order does not 
apply to La.R.S. § 14:89.2(C); 4. Defendants LeBlanc and Edmonson, in their official capacities 
must remove Plaintiffs from the SOCPR within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Judgment and 
Order, following the procedures laid out in paragraph 4 of the Protective Order...; 5. Defendants 
in their official capacities, and all persons under the control or supervision of Defendants, are 
permanently enjoined from disclosing Plaintiffs' prior inclusion on the SOCPR, and must remove 
Plaintiffs from any and all municipal, city and state databases which indicate that Plaintiffs were 
included on the SOCPR within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Judgment and Order; 6. 
Defendants LeBlanc and Edmonson, in their official capacities, must notify all...agencies that 
have been provided within information about Plaintiffs' inclusion on the SOCPR...of Plaintiffs'
