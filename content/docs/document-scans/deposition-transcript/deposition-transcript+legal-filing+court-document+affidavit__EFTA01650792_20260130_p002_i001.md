Subject: My clients/Jeffrey Epstein victims 
Thank you so much for giving me a call today to discuss the therapy options for my three clients who 
were among the ori inal laintiffs who filed civil lawsuits against Jeffrey E stein in South Florida. As I 
mentioned, 2 are 
rea and 1 is now living in 
All three are 
in need of counseling services. 
You mentioned that you will double-check the list of known JE victims to confirm they are eligible for 
therapy assistance. I am providing these names to  you confidentiality with the understanding that they 
will never become  part of a  public record and will otherwise remain confidential due to the women's 
statuses as victims of child sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. They have never been  publicly identified 
in any court records or media.

resides in 
than 
f possible. 
2. 
(f/k/a 
resides in the 
area. 
3. 
She is sometimes known in records as 
as well. 
resides in he 
area too. 
and would prefer counseling services in Erather 
In the event that one or more of these women has not been previously identified to the FBI, please let 
me know what information you need to determine their eligibility and I will get it to you in short order. 
I would ask that all contact about these three women be through me (or my office) rather than with the 
women directly. As we discussed on the phone, among the lingering effects for each of them is a 
fundamental distrust of anyone trying to obtain information Epstein. He was not above lying and 
trickery during the course of the lawsuits and he certainly had enough resources to buy real-looking 
fake credentials for people to pose as FBI agents, so as sad as it is, they all assume that anyone who 
contacts them has to be lying about their identities and motives. Also, as I mentioned, none of them 
have shared with their spouses/partners that they were abused by Epstein, and the more people 
contacting them, the harder it is to keep that a secret. It is probably best for everyone that I'm the 
communications conduit for everything. 
Please let me know what you need to get the counseling for each up and running. I will contact the 
therapist that I know in the 
area that 
was interested in seeing to see if she takes credit 
cards, and I will also do some homework on 
, another therapist in that area that you 
mentioned. 
will definitely need some referrals or recommendations if you have them; she does 
not have any particular therapist in mind at this time. 
Thanks again. And please know that I remain committed to assisting your team with their investigation 
in any way that I can, even if it does not involve my clients specifically. Between Brad, Brittany, Adam 
and I, we probably have the best combined institutional knowledge of the case through 2011. I will 
readily admit that Brad is a much better resource for everything post-2011. But if I can assist in any 
way, please let me know.
