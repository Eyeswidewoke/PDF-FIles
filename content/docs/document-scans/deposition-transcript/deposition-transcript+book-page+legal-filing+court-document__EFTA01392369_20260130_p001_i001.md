Partners or to cover defaults, the Access Fund may no longer be able to fully meet its capital contribution 
obligations towards the Underlying Fund and may be treated as a defaulting investor for purposes of the 
Underlying Fund LPA. 
Cash Management; Over-commitment. To help manage cash flows and ensure sufficient amount of the 
Limited Partner's subscriptions arc available to pay expenses of the Access Fund, the General Partner may, 
in its sole discretion, choose not to commit up to 10% of the Limited Partners' Subscriptions to the Access 
Fund for investment into the Underlying Fund. However, the General Partner is not required to set aside 
any such amounts, and may commit up to 100% of the Limited Partners' Subscriptions to the Underlying 
Fund. If the General Partner over-commits the Access Fund to the Underlying Fund (i.e., commits an 
amount to the Underlying Fund, which together with any expenses of the Access Fund, is greater than the 
total amount of the Limited Partners' Subscriptions to the Access Fund) the General Partner may need to 
fund Access Fund expenses or future capital calls by the Underlying Fund through the distributions received 
from the Underlying Fund (in such case the Limited Partners will be allocated income without 
corresponding cash to pay taxes on such income) or through borrowings. However, if there is a delay in the 
return of capital, or insufficient capital is returned from the Underlying Fund and the Access Fund is not 
able to borrow sufficient funds, the Access Fund may no longer be able to fully meet its capital contribution 
obligations towards the Underlying Fund. 
Lack of Diversification. The Access Fund only intends to invest in the Underlying Fund. Accordingly, 
the assets of the Access Fund are subject to greater risk of loss than if they were more widely diversified. 
Poor performance on the part of the Underlying Fund will cause poor performance of the Access Fund. If 
the Access Fund if not able to raise enough capital, it will also invest less in the Underlying Fund than 
originally contemplated. 
Forward-Looking Statements. Statements contained in this Memorandum that arc not historical facts arc 
based on current expectations, estimates, projections, opinions and/or beliefs of the General Partner and the 
Investment Manager. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, 
and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. Moreover, certain information contained in this 
Memorandum constitutes "forward-looking" statements, which often can be identified by the use of 
forward-looking terminology such as -may," -will," "seek," "should," "expect," "anticipate," "project," 
"estimate," "intend?" -continue," - target." -plan," or "believe," or the negatives thereof or other variations 
thereon or comparable terminology. Due to various risks and uncertainties, including those set forth herein, 
actual events or results or the actual performance of the Access Fund and the Underlying Fund may differ 
materially from those reflected or contemplated in such forward-looking statements. 
Disqualification of Certain "Bad Actors" from Rule 506 Offerings. The Interests are offered in reliance 
upon the exemptions from registration provided in the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated 
thereunder. The Access Fund would be disqualified from relying on Rule 506 of Regulation D ("Rule 
506") for any offer or sale of Interests if certain -bad actors" are involved in such offering, unless the 
disqualification could not have been identified by the Access Fund in the exercise of reasonable care or has 
been waived by the SEC staff. The Access Fund has implemented certain procedures to prevent any 
"Covered Person" (as defined in Rule 506(d)) subject to a -disqualifying event" (as defined in Rule 
506(d)(1) of Regulation D) from participating in the offering of Interests or investing in the Access Fund. 
Covered Persons include, but arc not limited to, the General Partner, the Placement Agents and beneficial 
owners of 20% or more of the Access Fund's voting equity securities. The General Partner may, in its sole 
discretion, involuntarily redeem all or a portion of a Limited Partner's Interest to satisfy the conditions set 
forth in Rule 506. Nevertheless there is a risk that the Access Fund will be required to terminate the offering 
of Interests in the event that an affiliate, Limited Partner holding 20% or more of the Access Fund's voting
