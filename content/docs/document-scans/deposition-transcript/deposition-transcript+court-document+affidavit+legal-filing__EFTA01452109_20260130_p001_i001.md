6.8 
U.S. Tax Matters. 
(a) 
U.S. Tax Allocations. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.8, 
each item of income, gain, loss or deduction recognised by the Fund shall be allocated 
among the Partners for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, to the extent 
permitted under the Code and the Treasury Regulations, in a manner that as closely as 
possible gives economic effect to the provisions of Article VI and the other relevant 
provisions of this Agreement, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, deductions 
attributable to the General Partner's Share shall be allocated among the Limited Partners 
in accordance with the amount calculated with respect to each Limited Partner as 
provided in Section 7.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner shall have 
the power to adjust such allocations as long as such adjusted allocations have substantial 
economic effect or are in accordance with the interests of the Partners in the Fund, in 
each case within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Tax credits and 
tax credit recapture shall be allocated in accordance with the Partners' interests in the 
Fund as provided in Treasury Regulations section 1.704-1(b)(4Xii). All matters 
concerning allocations for U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. income tax purposes, 
including accounting procedures, not expressly provided for by the terms of this 
Agreement shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. 
(b) 
Tax Matters Partner. The General Partner is hereby designated as the tax 
matters partner of the Fund, in accordance with the Treasury Regulations promulgated 
pursuant to section 6231 of the Code and any similar provisions under any other state or 
local or non-U.S. tax laws. Each Partner hereby consents to such designation and agrees 
that, upon the request of the General Partner, it will execute, certify, acknowledge, 
deliver, swear to, file and record at the appropriate public offices such documents as may 
be necessary or appropriate to evidence such consent. 
(c) 
Partnership for Tax Purposes. Either the General Partner shall have 
executed and filed a U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 prior to the date hereof 
electing to classify the Fund as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to section 301.7701-3 of the Treasury Regulations with effect as of a date no 
later than the date hereof, or the General Partner shall timely execute and file such form 
8832 on or after the date hereof electing to classify the Fund as a partnership for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes with effect as of a date no later than the date hereof, and the 
General Partner is hereby authorised to execute and file such Form 8832 for all of the 
Partners. The General Partner shall not subsequently elect to change such classification. 
The General Partner is hereby authorised to execute and file for all of the Partners any 
comparable form or document required by any applicable U.S. tax law for the Fund to be 
classified as a partnership under such tax law. The Fund shall not participate in the 
establishment of an "established securities market" (within the meaning of section 
1.7704-1(b) of the Treasury Regulations) or a "secondary market or the substantial 
equivalent thereof' (within the meaning of section 1.7704-1(c) of the Treasury
