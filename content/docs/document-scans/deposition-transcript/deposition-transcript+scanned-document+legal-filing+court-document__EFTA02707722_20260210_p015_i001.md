under the control of Bank or any of its agents, affiliates or correspondents, without notice or 
demand, any and all obligations due hereunder. Additionally, Bank shall have all rights and 
remedies available under each of the Loan Documents, as well as all rights and remedies 
available at law or in equity. The recourse of the Bank against the Borrower for the 
Obligations shall not include any of the Borrower's right, title or interest in his residences, 
items of jewelry or furniture or loans to trusts of which any of the Borrower's children are 
beneficiaries. 
6. 
Non-waiver. Bank's failure, at any time, to exercise any of its options or any other 
rights hereunder or under any other Note shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall it be 
a bar to the exercise of any of its options or rights at a later date. All rights and remedies of 
Bank shall be cumulative and may be pursued singly, successively or together, at the option 
of Bank. The acceptance by Bank of any partial payment shall not constitute a waiver of any 
default or of any of Bank's rights under any Note. No waiver of any of its rights hereunder, 
and no modification or amendment of any Note, shall be deemed to be made by Bank unless 
the same shall be in writing, duly signed on behalf of Bank; and each such waiver shall apply 
only with respect to the specific instance involved, and shall in no way impair the rights of 
Bank or the obligations of Obligor to Bank in any other respect at any other time. 
7. 
Applicable Law, Venue and Jurisdiction. This Note and the rights and obligations of 
Borrower and Bank shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the 
State of New York. In any litigation in connection with or to enforce any Note or any 
endorsement of any Note or any Loan Document, Obligors, and each of them, irrevocably 
consent to and confer personal jurisdiction on the courts of the State of New York or the 
United States located within the State of New York and expressly waive any objections as to 
venue in any such courts. Nothing contained herein shall, however, prevent Bank from 
bringing any action or exercising any rights within any other state or jurisdiction or from 
obtaining personal jurisdiction by any other means available under applicable law. 
8. 
Partial Invalidity. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of any Note 
shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein or therein and the 
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of any Note or of the Loan Documents to any 
person or circumstance shall not affect the enforceability or validity of such provision as it 
may apply to other persons or circumstances. 
9. 
Binding Effect. This Note shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower, 
Obligors and Bank and their respective successors, assigns, executors, heirs and personal 
representatives, provided, however, that no obligations of Borrower or any Obligor 
hereunder can be assigned without prior written consent of Bank. 
10. 
Controlling Document. To the extent that this Note conflicts with or is in any way 
incompatible with the provisions of any other Loan Document, this Note shall control over 
such other document unless this Note does not address an issue, in which case the terms of 
any Loan Document addressing such issue shall govern. This Note amends and restates the 
Consolidated, Amended and Restated Promissory Note, dated June 10, 2003, from the 
Borrower to the Bank in the principal amount of $30,000,000, as thereafter amended and
