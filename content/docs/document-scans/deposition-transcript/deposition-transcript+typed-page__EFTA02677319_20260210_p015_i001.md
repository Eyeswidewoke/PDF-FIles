In the past, water created greater unity than division. In the seventeenth or eighteenth century 
residents of New York, Saint Domingue or London were much closer in thought and deed to one 
another than London to Manchester or New York to New Haven. The Atlantic Ocean functioned as 
a highway of sorts linking Europe, the Americas, and Africa through trade, cultural exchange as 
well as conquest and colonization. This course examines the conflicts and exchanges between 
these regions from 1492 to 1945. Along the way we will consider examine issues of trade. 
smuggling and piracy: colonization and the development of the plantation system, slavery and 
other forms of labor: creolization, cultural exchange and resistance: and revolution, independence,

MW 03:50 PM - 05:30 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 5084 Sec A 
This course surveys the history and culture of Jews from Biblical times to the post-World-War II 
period. Traversing Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and Modernity. we will examine the ways in which 
Jews interacted with and experienced other religious and intellectual systems (Hellenism. 
Christianity, Islam. the Reformation, the Renaissance, Enlightenment. Socialism, and Nationalism) 
across the empires and modern states In which they lived. While major historical events and the 
everyday lives of Jews in different periods will receive a fair amount of attention, the focus of this 
course will be the history of Jewish ideas. This will involve close readings of key Jewish texts 
ranging from the Talmud to short stories by Philip Roth. We will ask: what has "Jetvishnese or 
'Judaism' meant for Jews In various times and places? How have Jews historically differentiated 
themselves from non-Jews? And how have Jews decided who has the authority to make such 
determinations? Throughout our study of Jewish history in particular, students will be encouraged 
to think critically about more general questions related to religion, identity, membership, and 
authority.

CRN 6849 Sec A 
'What were the nineteensixties? What do people mean when they say "'The Sixties"? When did 
the decade begin and when did it end? What were its roots? What is its legacy? How do we begin 
to understand a period which was characterized by upheaval and fragmentation and challenge to 
many of the most sacred dogmas of American life? Far more than a movement for civil rights, or a 
war, or a cultural phenomenon. the sixties was a period of rapid political and social change. A 
decade that bore witness to the highs and lows of the American experience, the 1960s has to be 
understood both as a watershed and as an ongoing process. The history of this long decade 
emphasizes the interrelationships between the specific events of the period and constant pressure 
of diverse political movements. Many of the major Issues we are grappling with today - the 
American presence in Afghanistan. conflict over immigration, school re-segregation, and cultural 
anxieties over gay marriage emerge from the successes, failures, and excesses of the 1960s. 
This seminar will look at the 1960s through multiple prisms: the Civil Rights movement. Black 
power, the war In Viet Nam and antiwar agitation, the assassinations, the student movements, 
feminism, and popular culture. We will use a wide range of sources - a mixture of primary 
documents (including film footage) and secondary accounts, but the emphasis will be on the words 
and the actions of the participants.'
