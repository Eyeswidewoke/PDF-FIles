We've tried to talk to you about your financial situation several times over the past couple of years, in person, 
by phone, and by e-mail. The process has been extremely unpleasant for us, and we presume for you as well. More 
importantly, it has not led to any enlightenment on any of our parts. Much of what we've tried to say you have flatly 
denied; some of it we think you simply haven't understood. You se=m absolutely convinced that your beliefs are correct 
and absolutely uninteres=ed in trying to look at the situation in other ways, to the extent that you can't even remember 
these exchanges. Much of what you've said=to us conflicts directly with our personal knowledge of your history and 
with legal and financial advice from every source we've heard from. So the conversations lead only to more stress and 
heartache. 
We are not willing to continue trying to discuss this with you unless somet=ing changes. One change would be 
to include a professional in the convers=tion who can resolve our differences in belief about basic facts. However, you 
have apparently decided that because you disapprove of some of the suggestions made by your former lawyer and 
financial managers -- many of which were based on choices you and Mommoy had made previously -- you will now not 
believe anything they tell you. That leaves us with no recour=e to determine the truth about anything that happened 
between 2007 and 2016.<=r> 
We have suggested a mediator as a last resort. Perhaps with a mediato= we can at least listen to each other's 
beliefs and perspectives, even i= we can't come to agreement on key points. Perhaps a mediator coul= even help us find 
a way to investigate the questions of fact and come to some conclusions that we could all accept. <=ont size="2" 
face="Arial"> 
Short of being able to talk to you openly, it's very important to the t=ree of us to protect you from future 
financial catastrophe. We have been trying our best to do this, and will continue to try, regardless of what happens with 
our communication. We believe that Eric Menoyo designed your estate plan properly to protect the interests of all 
parties, and we will continue to work to ensure that the plan is administered in a faith=ul and professional way. 
We also wanted to say that we have a different interpretation of how we have balanced respect, privacy, and 
autonomy, versus questions and interfer=nce, in our family history. You tell us that you deeply resent being asked 
quest=ons when you request financial withdrawals, and you deeply resent our questions about your financial situation. 
You say that you are the only one being questioned in this way. But we don't believe that's the case. Histo=ically, as a 
family we have been open with each other about our individual financia= situations; we have watched out for each 
other and stepped in if we felt it was needed; and on the most concrete level, any request to access funds from any of 
the trusts has always required an explanation to go along with it. 
In Avi's case, you and Mommoy interfered to tell her that something=was going very wrong with Sandi and that 
she had to get professional help; to practically force her to go meet with a lawyer Mommoy found for her when she 
became convinced that Avi's marriage to Jon was causing harm; and to order Avi to go see a doctor and get on 
medication when she confesse= that she couldn't handle things. That is: when Mommoy s=w Avi doing fine, she didn't 
pry or interfere. When she saw her=falling apart, she stepped in to help. 
In Diane's case, she discussed her financial situation with Mommoy =n a very open way on many, many 
occasions, leading Mommoy to offer her things like washing machines (we all know how that turned out) and more 
significan=ly, help with rent payments during a few years in Mexico, during a period when: Oxfam had stopped paying 
the rent, Gmo had stopped receiving his stipend as a grad student, and Diane was still suffering from a considerabl= 
salary cut imposed by Oxfam after the move to Mexico. Diane accepted her offer, which was a huge temporary help 
while she got herself back on her feet. 
Furthermore, on the occasions when Diane has asked Bainco for money from the trust that is in her name, she is 
always asked to explain exactly what it is for. This happens even though the amounts have never been very large. If 
anything looks odd, the trustees come back to her with questions. Harry once even phoned her because what she was 
asking for seemed so strange and he was concerned that something was wrong (in case you are wondering what was 
indeed going on, it was a small Mexican peso loan to a friend in trouble, which Diane couldn't do by other means 
because she was trav=ling at the time, and it couldn't wait until she got back home). Diane has n=t found this
