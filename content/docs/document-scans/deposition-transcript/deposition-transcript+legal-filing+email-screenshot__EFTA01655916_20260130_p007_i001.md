Chicago Man Sent Dozens of Sextortion Victims, Family Members Threatening Messages 
Fox News (06/03, Eberhart) reported that a Chicago man admitted to targeting "dozens" of gay men in a 
cyberstalking and sextortion scheme and threatened to expose their concealed sexual orientation and leak their 
explicit photos. Court documents detail Omoruyi Uwadiae's interactions with eight unnamed victims, but federal 
prosecutors said there are many other unknown victims of Udawiae, who pleaded guilty in a federal case on May 
22. In one instance, Uwadiae sent a victim's images to his mom, court documents say. In other incidents, he sent 
the victims' photos to their brother and sister. The article added that he used several different bogus accounts on 
apps like Grindr, Instagram, and Snapchat, among other apps, to convince his targets to send him explicit photos, 
which he used as blackmail, court records show. The article noted that Uwadie "demanded money from some 
victims," federal prosecutors said in a press release. "From others, he demanded they meet him, have sex with him, 
or make damaging admissions such as admissions that they were racist." The article quoted Special Agent in Charge 
Douglas DePodesta, who said, "The FBI has seen a horrific increase in reports of financial sextortion schemes, 
protecting children is one of the highest priorities of the FBI. We need parents and caregivers to work with us to 
prevent this crime before it happens and help children come forward if it does." A DO1 press release noted that the 
case was investigated by the FBI and the Columbus Division of Police. 
FBI Reports 700% Increase in Sextortion Schemes Targeting Teens Online 
Atlanta News First (06/03, Kousouris) reported that the FBI defines sextortion as a crime involving someone 
threatening to distribute another person's private and sensitive material. According to the federal agency, 
sextortion cases are up 700% since 2021. The average victim is between 10 and 17 years old but can be as young as 
seven years old, according to investigators. More boys fall victim. The article added that Jacinta Miller, the 
Supervisory Special Agent over the Violent Crimes Against Children Squad, said these criminals target kids on social 
media apps and video games. The article quoted Miller, who said, "It's not only financial. We see a huge chunk of 
financial extortion after the child has produced the sexual image or video, but it could extend to harm to people 
close to them, or their friends or pets in the house, things like that, and it propagates from the shame that the child 
feels from not being able to talk to a trusted adult, a parent or guardian, or something like that. And then they're 
enticed to do more and more things because the perpetrator online has now said, Well, I'm going to release this to 
your parents. I'm going to release this to your friends?' The article mentioned that Chief of the Human Trafficking 
Unit at the Attorney General's Office Hannah Palmquist hopes a new law will give prosecutors a chance to put more 
criminals behind bars and discourage anyone from committing sextortion crimes. The proposed law would make it 
a felony if someone tried to groom a child online or if they had any explicit photos or videos of children. 
Los Angeles Shooter Who Commited Hate Crime Against Jewish Men Faces up to 40 Years in Prison 
CBS News (06/03, Wenzke) reported that a man who shot and wounded two Jewish men in West Los Angeles 
pleaded guilty Monday to federal hate crime charges and faces up to 40 years in prison. Jaime Tran, 29, admitted in 
a plea deal to opening fire on the two men as they left religious services in the Pico-Robertson district on two 
separate occasions, shooting the first victim in the back on Feb. 15 and targeting the second victim the following 
day, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California. Both victims were wearing 
yarmulkes at the time and the plea agreement signed by Tran states he told investigators he chose the men based 
on their "head gear." Tran also admitted in the plea deal that he searched online for "kosher markets" before the 
crimes. A DOJ press release quoted Krysti Hawkins, the acting Assistant Director of the FBI's Los Angeles Field 
Office, who said, "The defendant's hatred led him to plan the murder of two innocent victims simply because he 
believed they were practicing their Jewish faith, I'm relieved that the hard work by investigators and prosecutors 
led to Iran's admission to these abhorrent crimes, and hope that members of the Jewish community take some 
solace in knowing that he will not be in the position to target their fellow members."
