said, "Be advised, federal agencies do not call or email individuals threatening arrest or demanding money, 
scammers often spoof caller ID information, and these phone calls are fraudulent even if they appear to be coming 
from an agency's legitimate phone number. Recipients should hang up immediately and report the call." KPTV (Fox-

FBI Raids Atlanta Corporate Landlord in Probe of Rental Market Price Fixing 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (06/05, Reynolds) reported that the federal government's antitrust investigation 
into price fixing in the rental market appears to have found a fulcrum in Atlanta after a surprise FBI raid of 
multifamily property developer Cortland Management. The May 22 search comes as the Biden administration's DOJ 
has reportedly deepened its price-fixing probe into Texas-based tech company RealPage over its rental pricing 
software and whether it colluded with landlords to raise rents. The article added that in a statement to The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution, Cortland Management said that the FBI had executed a limited search warrant at the 
company's Atlanta office as part of the DOJ's investigation "into potential antitrust violations in the multifamily 
housing industry." 
Continued Reporting: What Will Become of the Epoch Times With Its Chief Financial Officer Accused of 
Money Laundering? 
The Associated Press (06/05, Bauder) reported that the arrest of an executive at The Epoch Times in a money-
laundering scheme this week has drawn attention to a media outlet that has lived largely in the shadows since its 
founding in 2000 and a transformation during the Trump administration. Federal prosecutors in New 
York charged Weidong "Bill" Guan of Secaucus, N.J., the chief financial officer of The Epoch Times, of steering at 
least $67 million in criminal proceeds, much from fraudulently obtained unemployment insurance benefits, to the 
company, its affiliates and himself. Guan pleaded not guilty but was suspended by The Epoch Times, which agreed 
to cooperate with prosecutors. The article noted that the case calls into question the future of a company that was 
a key online supporter of Trump and spreader of conspiracy theories. 
Over 850 Murders Linked to Long-Haul Truckers 
NEWSNATION (06/05, Menezes) reported that at least 850 murders across the United States over the past few 
decades are believed to be connected to long-haul truck drivers, according to the FBI's "Highway Serial Killings 
Initiative." According to the article, Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said 
Wednesday on NewsNation's "Elizabeth Vargas Reports" that truckers who spend most of their time on the road 
are often the suspects. The FBI initiative helps link murders that initially seem unrelated but follow a pattern of 
female victims, many involved in prostitution or sex trafficking, being picked up at truck stops, sexually assaulted, 
and then killed, with their bodies dumped in different locations. The article noted that the FBI contends that while 
most truck drivers are hardworking Americans, the inherent isolation and transient nature of the job could draw 
serial killers or potentially create them. 
Another Victim From Suspected Serial Killer's Indiana Farm ID'd as Man Who Went Missing in 1993 
USA TODAY (06/05, Martin) reported that authorities have identified the remains of a man found on a suspected 
serial killer's Indiana farm nearly 30 years ago. The remains were among more than 10,000 found in 1996, 
authorities say. Some of the remains were identified as those of Jeffrey A. Jones, who last lived in Fillmore, Indiana, 
and was reported missing in August 1993, the Hamilton County Coroner's Office announced on Facebook on May 
21. The article added that Jones is the third person to be identified from the office's "renewed" investigation into 
the remains found on Fox Hollow Farm, located in Westfield, about 30 miles north of Indianapolis. The farm was 
once home to suspected serial killer Herb Baumeister, the coroner's office said. The first two victims identified in 
the renewed probe were 27-year-old Allen Livingston and 34-year-old Manuel Resendez. The most recently-
identified remains belonging to Jones were found in 1996. The article noted that the coroner's office and the FBI 
conducted an "extensive forensic genetic genealogy investigation" to identify the remains, the release said. The 
office still has four more DNA profiles to identify, bringing the total number of victims to 12, the coroner's office 
said. Those four DNA profiles will also be sent to the FBI for a genetic genealogy investigation.
