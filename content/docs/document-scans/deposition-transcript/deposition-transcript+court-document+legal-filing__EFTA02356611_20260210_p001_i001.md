Re: 
I will do the staffing guides, and then sit with my guys and Brice as =o what stays and what goes as far as construction is 
concerned. To be hone=t honest I don't think you need any more buildings you have enough bac=-up now for a hundred 
room hotel. Once again I will know better after a lo=ger stay there, one you need to bring closure to construction and 
two get =our energy and water issues under control.

Jeff, first I would be happy to go over and get all the things that yo= want done, it's not a big deal and I 
think I can do it in a very effi=ient manner. You have some good people over there that need some direction= But I need 
to ask some questions first; 
• 
What is the scope of the work you want completed now. They are talki=g about roads, walls, 
permanent engineering facilities, etc. 
• 
I need access to all staffing guides that have been prepared. 
• 
Are there any budgetary guidelines in place. 
• 
Who is going to stay on the Island when the project is completed ( will=it be Brice and his wife). 
• 
Do we have contracts for your HVAC and mechanical plants? 
You may not know all these answers, but as long as everyone knows that=is what I need to know when I 
go down there I will be fine. I was introduc=d to you by an friend and representative of Tom Pritzger, of which both I 
=ave the highest esteem for, but you must understand I am presently gainful=y employed and at the present had no 
intention of leaving my present posit=on, unless something drastically changed the direction that I am going in.=With 
that being said I will make arrangements with Cecile to go to the Isl=nd next Friday and Saturday and sort through 
everything. I will probably b=ing two professionals (landscaping and engineering with me) to look at the=project while I 
work with your team to get you the answers you are looking=for. The professionals will be free because everyone in 
Puerto Rico is loo=ing for work and all I am looking to get from them is an appraisal of what=needs to be done to get this 
job done and run efficiently going forward.<hiv> 
For me to make it simple I would charge $225 an hour (that's what = pay my accountant) plus a plan 
ticket from San Juan to Saint Thomas, and =f you could put me up at the house it would be great. Also my son is a Jun=or 
at Brandeis University studying international finance and if you woul= consider him interning a couple of weeks at 
Christmas with your group t=at would be appreciated.
