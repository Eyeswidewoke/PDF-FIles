2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139535, * 
declines to compel a response to this request. See, e.g., World Triathlon Corp. v. SRS 
Sports Centre SDN, BHD, Case No. 8:04-cv-1594-T-24TBM, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
15412, at *2 (M.D. Fla. July 29, 2005)("the court may limit discovery upon the 
determination that the discovery sought is unreasonably burdensome or expensive or the 
expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the 
needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, and the importance 
of the proposed discovery in resolving issues."); Priest v. Rotary, 98 F.R.D. 755, 761 (N.D. 
Cal. 1983)("When a discovery request '[a]pproaches the outer bounds of relevance and 
the information requested may only marginally enhance the objectives of providing 
information to the ["31] parties or narrowing the issues, the Court must then weigh that 
request with the hardship to the party from whom the discovery is sought."')(quoting 
Carlson Cos., Inc. v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 374 F.Supp. 1080, 1088 (D.Minn. 1974)); 
10 Federal Procedure, Lawyer's Edition § 26:70 (1994 & Supp. 2005)("the district courts 
should not neglect their power to restrict discovery where justice requires protection for a 
party ... from undue burden or expense."). 
Finally, to the extent Epstein asks the Court to forbid the drawing of an adverse inference 
against Epstein for his failure to respond to discovery, said request is denied at this time, 
without prejudice and with leave to renew at a later date, as the request at this early 
juncture of the proceedings is premature. 
In accordance with the above and foregoing, it is hereby 
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Answers to Interrogatories 
and Production of Documents (D.E. #57) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART 
in accordance with the terms of the within Order. In accordance herewith, Plaintiffs Motion 
as it relates to Interrogatories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 and Production 
Requests 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 20 is denied, and Plaintiffs Motion as it 
relates to Interrogatories r32] 7, 8 and 11, and Production Requests 17 and 23 is 
granted. A ruling on Plaintiff's Motion as it relates to Production Requests 10, 11, 18, 19, 
and 21 is deferred until Epstein files his Supplementary Response Brief, due fifteen (15) 
days from the date hereof, in which Epstein is required to make a particularized showing, 
by in camera submission or otherwise, demonstrating how the Fifth Amendment may 
validly be asserted in response to these requests. Any of the above-mentioned requests 
(Requests 10, 11, 18, 19 and 21) not addressed in the forthcoming supplement are 
deemed by the Court to be outside a valid claim of Fifth Amendment privilege and must be 
responded to within fifteen (15) days from the date hereof. 
DONE AND ORDERED this August 4, 2009, in Chambers, at West Palm Beach, Florida.
