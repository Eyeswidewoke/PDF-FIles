Aircraft shall be released from the security interest of this Agreement, and Agent shall discharge all 
registrations with the International Registry with respect to the Aircraft. 
(b) Upon an Event of Loss with respect to any Engine or APU under circumstances in which 
there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe, Borrower shall, within thirty (30) days 
after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, replace such Engine or APU, as applicable, and grant to Agent a 
first priority security interest and security assignment in a similar or better engine or auxiliary power unit, as 
applicable. Such engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable, shall be of the same make and model 
number as the Engine or APU suffering the Event of Loss and shall be free and clear of all Liens and shall 
have a value, utility and useful life at least equal to, and be in as good an operating condition as, the Engine 
or APU suffering the Event of Loss, assuming such Engine or APU was in the condition and repair required 
by the terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss. Borrower, at its own cost 
and expense, shall fumish Agent with such documents to evidence such conveyance and make such filings 
as Agent shall request to subject such engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable, to the lien of this 
Agreement. 
Each such replacement engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable, shall, after such 
conveyance be deemed an 'Engine' or "API! (as defined herein), as applicable, and shall be deemed part 
of the same Aircraft as was the Engine or APU replaced thereby. 
(c) Agent shall be entitled to receive and retain all proceeds payable by any insurer with 
respect to an Event of Loss, by any manufacturer with respect to a Return to Manufacturer or by any 
governmental authority withresped to any Requisition of Use, as the case may be; provided however, that 
so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists and Borrower has complied with the provisions of this 
Section 2.7, then Agent shall remit such proceeds to Borrower. 
(d) If the Airframe, any Engine, APU or major Part has su 
 any damage requiring the FM 
to be notified of such damage by use of an FAA Form 337 or otherwise, then within ten (10) days of such 
notification to the FAA, Borrower shall notify Agent of such damage, and Agent and, Borrower shall consult 
for the purpose of determining the diminished value of the Aircraft resulting from such damage history. The 
diminished value of the Aircraft shall be the amount by which the fair market sales value of the Aircraft 
without such damage history exceeds the fair market sales value of the Aircraft with such damage history. 
For purposes hereof, fair market sales value shall be determined on the following basis: (i) the value shall 
be the amount which would be obtained in an arm's length transaction between an informed and willing 
buyer (who is not a used aircraft dealer), and an informed and willing seller under no compulsion to sell; (ii) 
the costs of removal of the Aircraft from its then location shall not be a deduction from such value; and (iii) in 
determining any such value, it shall be assumed (whether or not the same be true) that the Aircraft has been 
maintained by Borrower and is in the condition in which it is required to be in accordance with this 
Agreement and that the total number of Airframe flight hours (including any component with hourly overhaul 
schedules) accumulated from the Closing Date to the date of such damage do not exceed the product of the 
flight hours limitation set forth in Annex B hereto times the number of twelve month periods and any portion 
thereof from the Closing Date to such date. 
Within ten (10) days after Borrower and Agent agree upon the diminished value of the Aircraft, 
Borrower shall pay Agent the amount of such diminished value, which payment Agent shall apply as a 
partial prepayment of the Obligations without any prepayment penalty. If Borrower and Agent cannot agree 
on the diminished value of the Aircraft within ten (10) days after notification of such damage to the FM. 
then Agent shall appoint an independent appraiser (reasonably acceptable to Borrower) to determine such 
value. Borrower agrees to pay the costs and expenses of any such determination and appraisal. The 
independent appraiser shall be required to complete such determination as promptly as practicable, but in 
any event, not later than forty (40) days after the date on which it is appointed. A final determination by the 
independent appraiser regarding the extent of any diminished value of the Aircraft shall be binding on 
Borrower and Agent. Within ten (10) days after the independent appraiser's determination of the diminished 
value of the Aircraft, Borrower shall pay Agent the amount of such diminished value, which payment 
Lenders shall apply as a partial prepayment of the Obligations without any prepayment penalty.
