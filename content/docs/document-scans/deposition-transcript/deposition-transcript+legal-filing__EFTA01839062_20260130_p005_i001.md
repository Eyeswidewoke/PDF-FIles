included four young women, had all flown to Washington D.C. from Paris to attend the party. As 
it turned out, this party on May 12i1 was the last in a series of libertine parties, many of which had 
the same guests. The first party had been in late 2009 in Paris. Then the group met in other cities, 
including Lille in the north of France, Brussels and once before in Washington DC, when DSK 
had taken one of the female guest for a visit to his IMF office. One participant was the 
politically-connected police Commissioner for the Lille region, Jean Christophe Lagarde. He was 
in an unusually good position to find attractive women for these parties because he was also 
providing protection for a prostitution ring that imported women from Belgium, where 
prostitution was legal, to France and operated out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille. Lagarde had also 
become, as had many other Socialist politicians, a supporter of DSK for his planned challenge to 
Sarkozy. The expenses for these small gatherings were mainly paid by two wealthy guests, David 
Roquet, an executive of the French construction group Eiffage, and Fabrice Pazskowski, a long-
time friend of DSK, who owned a medical supply company. For the party on May 12'h, Lagarde 
brought two women from France, called "Florence" and "Helene." They were introduced to DSK, 
according to Lagarde's subsequent testimony, as secretaries at Eiffage, but there in fact 
prostitutes, The other two women were friends of Pazskowski' and DSK (who were not paid.) 
The party had gone onto the wee hours of May Ir. 
Before DSK had left the W hotel, he had a private conversation with Lagarde in his room. 
Lagarde warned that now that DSK had decided to run for President, these sex parties could be a 
serious political risk. His main concern was that DSK's risque activities could be exposed in the 
intense scrutiny that would come with a political campaign. 
Lagarde's warning in Washington may have been more prophetic than he realized. In 
December 2011, a French journalist learned from authorities investigating the prostitution ring 
that there existed a word-for-word transcript of the conversation between DSK and Lagarde in the 
W hotel in Washington DC on May 12'". If true, it would suggest that DSK's activities had been 
monitored before he arrived in New York. According to what this journalist was told, this 
interception had resulted from a freak coincidence in which DSK's speaker phone was 
accidentally left on and it somehow connected to a French phone number that was under legal 
surveillance. As the journalist was unable to obtain the putative recording, or match it to DSK 
and Lagarde's voices, it remains unconfirmed. 
DSK was surprised, as he later recalled, that his arriving taxi was greeted by a uniformed 
Sofitel doorman from the hotel on the street before it had even reached the hotel. Other than 
booking his room at the Sofitel for the afternoon of May 14i', he did not advise the hotel as to his 
time of arrival. As it turned out he caught a later flight than he expected in Washington DC and it 
arrived at JFK in New York at 6:21 PM that Friday night. He had only carry-on baggage. and 
caught a yellow taxi from the queue. By 7:08 PM, the taxi arrived at the 44m Street entrance of 
the Sofitel. The doorman unloaded his bag and brief case while he paid. He then carried his own 
baggage to the hotel, pulling the small wheeled bag behind him. In the entrance way, he was met 
by a female clerk, who accompanied him through the lobby to the reception area, which is on the 
45'h side of the building. After he had signed in, he went directly to the presidential suite on the 
28m floor. 
What he did not see when the taxi pulled up was that his arrival may have been anticipated. 
(See CCTV Tape A ). Ninety seconds before DSK's taxi pulled up at the 44m street entrance, a 
tall, well dressed man came out of the hotel, a cell phone pressed to his ear. He walked out in the 
street and handed the phone to the doorman. They both looked down 44'h street. The well-
