too much." Asked who says that, Trump said, "Just read the manuals. Read the books. ... What 
testing does it shows cases. It shows where there may be cases. Other countries test - you 
know when they test? They test when somebody's sick. I'm not saying they're right or wrong. 
Nobody's done it like we've done it. We've gotten absolutely no credit for it." 
Trump, Pence Tout Administration's Coronavirus Response. 
President Trump said in an interview with Axios on HBOVi (8/3), "I think we've done an 
incredible job, between the ventilators and stopping very infected people from China coming in, 
meaning putting the ban on China, which frankly nobody wanted me to do, practically nobody, 
because it was very early in January. Then putting the ban on Europe, not an easy thing to do. 
When you put a ban on Europe, that's a big thing. We would've probably lost hundreds of 
thousands of lives more had I not done that. And all of the experts, every one of them, not one 
of them wanted to do it. They thought it was too severe. Three months later, they were all 
saying, 'I'm glad you did it." 
The President took to Twitter Monday to write, "With the exception of New York & a few 
other locations, we've done MUCH better than most other Countries in dealing with the China 
Virus. Many of these countries are now having a major second wave. The Fake News is working 
overtime to make the USA (& me) look as bad as possible!" 
Vice President Pence said on Fox News' Ingraham Angle (8/3), "I think the American 
people have seen this President take decisive action from very early in the coronavirus 
pandemic. Before there was a single case of community transmission, before the end of 
January, President Trump suspended all travel from China, stood up the White House 
coronavirus task force and in the first few weeks of February, we actually began the process of 
developing a vaccine and you just heard a week ago that we are already at a historic pace in 
phase three clinical trials of the first coronavirus vaccine for this country, could well be available 
for this fall. In the midst of all of that, we've taken testing from a standing start to nearly 60 
million coronavirus tests performed. PPE is in great abundance even across the areas of the 
country where we've seen rising cases." 
Pence: Lives Were Lost In New York Due To "Poor Decisions" By Cuomo. Pence 
was asked on Fox News' Ingraham Angle (8/3) about criticism by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 
(D) of the Administration's handling of the pandemic. Pence said, "Our hearts grieve for the fact 
that one in five of all the American lives that have been lost in the coronavirus pandemic were 
lost in the state of New York and some of that was because of poor decisions by the state and 
by Gov. Cuomo. But look, I liked it better when he said that President Trump's leadership in the 
pandemic was, in his words, `phenomenal.' He said that repeatedly. ... I couldn't be more proud 
of the support that we rendered to the people of New York and I think the people of New York 
know that." 
White House Implements Random Coronavirus Testing. 
Chip Reid reported on the CBS Evening NewsVi (8/3, story 7, 0:15, O'Donnell, 4.37M), "Even 
though the President has downplayed the need for COVID testing nationwide, today the White 
House announced mandatory random COVID testing for all West Wing staffers. This comes after 
several White House aides and reporters here have tested positive." The AP (8/3) reports the 
White House "said the measure was 'part of our ongoing efforts to protect the health and 
safety' of the White House Complex." 
Politico (8/3, Orr, 4.29M) says "it was not immediately clear whether there would be 
consequences for aides who decline to be tested for the virus or fail to show up when 
summoned to the White House Medical Unit." According to Politico, "inside the White House, 
testing has become increasingly widespread amid continued outbreaks in states that began 
reopening earlier this summer." Politico adds that the White House "currently relies on a 
portable coronavirus test made by Abbott Laboratories, which produces results in five minutes
