Business 
Our mission 
Establishing a romantic connection is a fundamental human need. Whether its a good date, a meaningful relationship or an enduring marriage. romantic 
connectivity lifts the human spirit. Our mission is to increase romantic connectivity worldwide. 
Who we are 
Match Group is the worlds leading provider of dating products. We operate a portfolio of over 45 brands, including Match, OkCupid. Tinder. Plenty0fFish, 
Meetic, Twoo, OurTime and FriendScout24, each designed to increase our users' likelihood of finding a romantic connection. Through our portfolio of trusted 
brands, we provide tailored products to meet the varying preferences of our users. We currently offer our dating products in 38 languages across more than 
190 countries, and we had approximately 59 million monthly active users, or MAU, and approximately 4.7 million paid members, using our dating products for 
the quarter ended September 30. 2015. 
Our target market includes all adults in North America. Western Europe and other select countries around the world who are not in a committed relationship 
and who have access to the internet, which, based on a study by Research Now commissioned by us in July 2015. we estimate at approximately 511 million 
people. Consumer preferences within this population vary significantly, influenced in part by demographics, geography, religion and sensibility. As a result, the 
market for dating products is fragmented, and no single product has been able to effectively serve the dating category as a whole. 
Given wide ranging consumer preferences, we approach the category with a brand portfolio strategy, through which we attempt to offer dating products that 
collectively appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers. We believe that this approach maximizes our ability to capture additional users, as demonstrated 
by our MAU and paid member count compound annual growth rates between the quarter ended September 30, 2011 and the quarter ended September 30, 
2015 of 63% and 23%, respectively. We increasingly apply a centralized discipline to learnings, best practices and technologies across our brands in order to 
increase growth, reduce costs and maximize profitability. This approach allows us to quickly introduce new products and features, optimize marketing 
strategies, reduce operating costs and more effectively deploy talent across our organization. 
Coinciding with the general trend toward mobile technology, we have experienced a meaningful shift in our user base from desktop devices to mobile devices, 
and now offer mobile experiences on substantially all of our dating products. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, pro forma for the Plenty0fFish
