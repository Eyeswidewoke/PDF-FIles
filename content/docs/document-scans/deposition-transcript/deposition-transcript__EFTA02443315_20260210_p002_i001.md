though you write you want ideas on how to prosper„ and hopefully recognize that i have 
only good feelings towards you , and would give you my best advice . It appears 
that you are not ready to learn , but want to hold on to the very ideas that got you 
to a difficult and in your words chalenging place.. as you recognize my daily rate is 
quite high, if you would think for an instant that i would believe that you want my 
advice for free and were trying to take advantage of me, instead of sharing my best 
thougths, I'm sorry.. I think it best that we part here, feel free to contact me in 
july. when i suggested you take 15 minutes, you decided on your own NO i'll take 
until tonight.. not helpful thoughtful bad energy sorry. I thought I'd be helpful to 
you and bring you back to florida so that you wouldn't have to face an ugly new 
york circumstance„ my hospitality was open.. i introduced my friends, to suggest 
that joe was trying to get something for nothing . was too much.. jean will 
organize your flight for today .. call in july

Jeffrey, 
You do realize I am quite shy and protective of much that has happened in my life... 
It is very big for me to ask and share that which I have. But I really realized after 
much illness and challenges what is important to me and that a lot of 
what stood in the way of change was my way of thinking. S0000 I 
have been opening myself up to thinking, looking at things in a 
different way. I appreciate you and observe that you have a great deal 
of integrity and good intention in what you say and do, which is a 
precious thing not always so often found and I have, a bit shyly, 
nervously, opening up! 
I have decided that come what may I wish to and choose to come from my heart 
and to put myself in as much alignment with who I am and what I love 
to do! And to let go of what happened in the past (hasn't been easy), 
not be a victim of it! I am very sensitive and I honestly do not 
understand much of what I have experienced, just that I am happy, 
really happy of who I am and who I choose to be! 
S000, I am at a wonderful point in my life and know that I have very special, 
unique, beautiful talents and knowledge to share and it is time for me 
to prosper! 
I am getting close to getting out of debt, do need to get my foot cared for and 
sincerely hope to not get so into debt over that but will do what it 
needs, what it takes. But want to let you know I really appreciate you 
and if you feel you have ideas or such that you feel to share in my 
reaching my goals, they are welcome!
