1. Introduction 
Many mechanisms can lead to power law distributions. Power laws have a special status due to 
the absence of a characteristic scale and the implicit (to the physicist) relationship with critical 
phenomena, a subtle many-body problem in which self-similarity and power laws emerge from 
cooperative effects leading to non-analytic behavior of the partition or characteristic function. 
Recently, Levy and Solomon [1) have presented a novel mechanism based on random multi-
plicative processes: 
we+1 = Anon 
(1) 
where Ae is a stochastic variable with probability distribution fl(A,) and we express we in units 
of a reference value wu which could be of the form en, with r constant. All our analysis below 
then describes the distribution of we normalized to wu, in other words in the "reference frame" 
moving with wu. At the end, we can easily make reappear the scale wu by replacing everywhere 
w by iv/wee. 
Taken literally with no other ingredient, expression (1) leads to the log-normal distribution 
[2-41. Indeed, taking the logarithm of (1), we can express the distribution of loges as the 
convolution of t distributions of log A. Using the cumulant expansion and going back to the 
variable wt leads, for large times t, to

where v = (log A) = fo°°dA log AII(A) and D = ((logA)2) — (logA)2. Expression (2) can be 
rewritten

Since '(ive) is a slowly varying function of wt, this form shows that the log-normal distribution 
can be mistaken for au apparent power law with an exponent p slowly varying with the range 
wt which is measured. Indeed, it was pointed out [51 that for we 4K e(v+2D)t, #(10) 0 1 and 
the log-normal is undistinguishable from the 1/wt distribution, providing a mechanism for 1/f 
noise. However, notice that µ(wt) 
oo far in the tail we > e("4-2O" and the log-normal 
distribution is not a power law. 
The ingredient added by Levy and Solomon 111 is to constrain we to remain larger than a 
minimum value coo > O. This corresponds to put back we to we as soon as it would become 
smaller. To understand intuitively what happens, it is simpler to think in terms of the variables 
r t = logics and I = log A, here following [1]. Then obviously, the equation (1) defines a 
random walk in z-space with steps 1 (positive and negative) distributed according to the density
