fosters discussion and we are convinced that whet the best people talk the outcome is advance and growth. We are hoping we can avoid standard 
prepared talks, and focus on exciting forefront issues. ..stem there may be differences of opinion or new results that will provoke wide discussion. You

Large Hadron Collider. the Planck mission, the recent results by satellite and ground based experiments on dark matter searches, and the vast progress 
in theory. Also by meetings such as the LUC Olympics, and the workshops of the past years at the N1CTP. Ktiv and Perimeter as well as
