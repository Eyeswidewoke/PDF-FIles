Now Kelly gets up, first her shoulders and then the rest of her. Where are you going? says Parker. She 
mutters something unintelligible. She's wasted. Parker smirks and says, She's trading up. Later, 
Parker will see her leaving The Box, being escorted out of The Box, rather, by security. She will 
be crying and angry and her dress will look like it needs a rest. 
Also at CV that night is Parker's friend Ricardo Garcia, a former hedge-fund guy turned PR guy and a 
promoter on the side. For him, it's less a way to make money than it is a sweet gig with 
benefits. 
Garcia says everyone is aware of how it works. American girls, I take them out to a nice restaurant, he 
says, to the cool clubs, and they're satisfied with that. That's what they get out of it. American 
girls are looking at the kind of wine you order. But Russian girls, they're after the serious shit. 
They want the Mercedes. Out at dinner, they're plotting ahead. They're calculating. They're 
professional. 
Most of the foreign girls come from bootleg modeling agencies. Places nobody has heard of, or maybe a 
friend has taken some shots of them in their Brighton Beach one-bedroom. Fembot-pink bras 
and crappy lighting. Money-hungry Russian girls go to the Boom Boom Room looking for serious 
bank, says Garcia. They say they're students or models, but you ask them what agency and they 
say, Oh, I don't like talking about that' American girls are not as obvious. They pinpoint banker 
guys, they're looking more for marriage or boyfriends. Maybe Italian girls and German girls will 
go to Cipriani Downtown. 
Oh, Cipriani is a fucking haven, says another guy at the table. It's the No. 1 spot in Manhattan for 
hookers and half-hookers. The difference between hookers and half-hookers is that the former 
will ask for money straight away, and the latter will ask for gifts. They follow the money as the 
money follows the seasons along the worldwide circuit of bottle service. St. Barts in December, 
Miami in March, Las Vegas in May. In New York, half-hookers hang out at steak places like Del 
Frisco's. Or the Friday-night parties at Le Cirque. 
These kinds of girls, this is how you spot them. Garcia says, You have to look at the discrepancy between 
her income and her lifestyle. These girls are going to St. Barts in May, Gstaad in winter. Their 
rent is three grand a month, and they don't have a roommate. Dresses cost them $1,000, 
$2,000. VIP hosts and bottle girls are half-pimps to these half-hookers, using them to keep their 
clients satiated. While some bottle girls will sleep with patrons, for the most part their 
interactions are limited to the confines of the club. Party girls are more like freelancers, and sex 
is their currency. 
The exchange happens like this. A girl will say to a guy she has not slept with yet, but perhaps they have 
kissed or she's let him touch her, I'm short on my rent or There's this dress I really want. After 
sleeping with him a few times, she might say, I need a tan. I should go to Miami. The beauty is 
in the subtle gaucheness. 
There is no nightly prostitution for the half-hookers, says Garcia. It's a weekly thing, or a monthly thing. 
And when both sides have gotten what they want, they move on. Unlike with true escorts and 
some bottle girls, these party girls won't admit what they're doing. This is because most of 
them can't admit it to themselves. Some girls are looking for husbands. Rich ones, but yes, they 
are looking to settle down. Garcia takes out his phone and shuffles to a picture of a gorgeous 
Swedish blonde. He says she was getting too expensive, asking for rent money. I had to send 
her home. Andrew Parker's friend had to pay a girl to leave. She was squatting at his 
apartment, they weren't even having sex anymore. She wanted twenty grand, he says. They 
settled on ten.
