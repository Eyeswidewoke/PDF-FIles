necessary for Barbados and South Pad=e, but to use it to look for new opportunities and to be prepared to becom= a 
major player when the market foreclosed on what I knew would be billion= of dollars of distressed assets. 
This year we have entered into a contract for the development of a distressed gol= project in St. 
Lucia. We have reached agreement with th= government of St. Kitts to start up, again, a resort project on the wes= 
coast of St. Kitts that had been abandoned because of mismanagement and=20 corruption, and we are at the contact 
stage of entering into agreement =n a 5,000 acre development in North Carolina where the owners need manageme=t 
and they need the ability to attract some money on a last-in, first-out=20 basis, and we are closely following a half dozen 
other distressed properties. 
In order to meet our negative cash requirements, we have exhausted our cash rese=ve, we have 
scrambled where possible, and I have borrowed over $1 million=20 personally and put it into the company. A few 
months ag=, a government bank for the eastern Caribbean, originally started by the =orld Bank, agreed to loan 
Landmark $5 million. The security=20 for the loan would be the 100% of the St. Lucia company that owns one-t=ird of 
Apes Hill Club in Barbados. That one-third interest =s worth somewhere between $20 million and $50 million; however, 
it is not=the type of security that you can leverage in the U.S. I am told that this loan has been approved by the Board 
of Oirec=ors and I will be able to draw funds the first of June; however, since I ha=e received no written confirmation of 
this to-date, I am naturally concerned. 
How I Would Like to Use Your Mind — If Allowed 
1. 
If I obtain the $5 million loan, t=e question before the house is how to position Landmark 
to create the max=mum value from its reputation, its management team, and its $153 million ta= loss. While I am a real 
estate man and know little of financial posturing, the best idea I have heard is to use Lan=mark as a platform company 
to become a leader in the management and resurrec=ion of a few of these foreclosed assets, and in 5 to 7 years when 
the profi=s can be realized from this financial disaster, with the tax loss used an= the reputation enhanced, to go public 
as a branded community developer much=as Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons are thought of as branded hotel operators. 
The idea would be to have an institution or=20 individual, or institutions and individuals, invest $15 million to $20=20 
million in convertible preferred stock in Landmark. If=20 after 3 years they decided to convert, they would own 
approximately the=same amount as the Barton family, however, this is simply one of I am sure m=ny ways it could be 
done and I know no one who, if you were willing, could=give me better guidance. 
2. 
If, in fact, my unfounded worries about =he consummation of this $5 million loan are 
justified, I will need to very=20 quickly see if I can borrow $3 million to $5 million on the one-third=20 security of Apes 
Hill and be able to keep the management team together =or perhaps another year. If that is not possible, I will=20 
quickly reduce the staff to those necessary for the operations that we =ave, substantially diminish my hope of being a 
leader in restructuring these=20 distressed resorts, and borrow what I can from my friends to survive th= end of this 
crisis. 
Jeffrey, if you are still reading this all too long email, I congratulate you on=your focus. For the 
last six months we have been following=20 many distressed properties and compiled it into what I call the "Zomb=e
