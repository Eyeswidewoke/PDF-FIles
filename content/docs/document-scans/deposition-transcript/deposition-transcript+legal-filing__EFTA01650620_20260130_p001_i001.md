Importance: Normal 
Some questions that will come up, and I am sure there will be others: 
1. 
What is your current Spanish capability? 
2. 
Have you tested in Spanish through language services to determine your level? 
3. 
What efforts have you made to learn Spanish? For example, have you applied to any classes, how many hours 
have you completed using the MP3 players from language services? 
4. 
How many times have you utilized a translator to accomplish your mission? 
5. 
How will your work be handled here in the NY AOR if you are on a TDY? 
6. 
Does the victim in Spain speak English? 
7. 
Have you been able to identify any resources in Spain that will be of benefit to the victim and have those 
resources been vetted? 
8. 
Has VSD previously worked with any resources in Spain? 
9. 
What is your proposed agenda while on TDY? IE: meeting with X number of victims, potential service providers, 
are there any other victims/cases aside from Epstein that you can engage on while you are there, conduct VSD 
briefings for embassy and consulate personnel 
are there any US Consulates in Spain — are there ALATs deployed 
anywhere else in Spain in consulates or off-sites that would benefit from any visit from VSD? 
I think you need to have a more robust plan put together for this to get any traction here. We can talk about it next week. 
Subject: Spanish TDY Proposal 
Hi Amanda - as we discussed previously I have been requesting to learn Spanish as the demand has increased in 
my case load. I am assigned to the squads who investigate Spanish - speaking gangs including MS-I3, 18th 
Street and Surenos 13. These squads have experienced an influx in their caseload, resulting in an increase in 
Spanish speaking victims and family members. I have received multiple requests from both the SSAs and the 
case agents on these squads asking that I learn to speak Spanish in at least law enforcement proficiency in order 
to communicate with the victims and their family members. The biggest benefit of having me learn Spanish is 
that it would reduce the burden on the case agents to take time away from their investigatory responsibilities to 
try to provide assistance to these victims. Furthermore, the case agents do not have the knowledge or access to 
resources that I possess in order to properly assist these victims. 
By way of example, recently a victim in the Jeffrey Epstein case currently residing in Spain was requesting 
therapy referrals. Since the Legat is not experienced in providing this type of assistance, it has been difficult for 
the Legat to find resources for the victim. This has resulted in the victim remaining in crisis. The New York Field 
Office is responsible for assisting the Legat with the victim which requires my assistance. 
Based on the above, my proposal is to allow me to take a TDY to the U.S. Embassy in Spain. This would allow 
me to be immersed in the culture, learn to speak Spanish and provide appropriate counseling and resources to 
FBI Spanish -speaking victims located in New York, Spain and throughout Europe.
