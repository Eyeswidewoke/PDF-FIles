cause" but she can't imagine how the court reached that view in this case. After some difficulty understanding 
the questions the witness accepted that the Svca court did not think issuing the warrant was disproportionate. 
She said that most Swedish lawyers believe the question as to whether something is disproportionate is simply a 
matter of intuition, which it is not. "It is obvious that they (the court] arc wrong". "I can't believe they have 
examined the case on the principle of proportionality". She then accepted that the Court of Appeal would have 
heard from Ms Ny and Mr Hurtig, the lawyer for Mr Assange. Again there was some confusion as to the 
questions and answers and the witness at first appeared to say the defence were not represented but later she 
said, after being referred to the decision of the court, that this document says Mr Hurtig was present, but she 
doesn't think he was. Overall the witness appeared unclear as to whether Mr Hurtig and the Court of Appeal 
had access to the evidence in the case. She suggested that the prosecution might have been economic with 
information. She was asked direct questions as to whether the court would decide whether this defendant 
should be on bail, if returned to Sweden. At first she appeared to avoid the question but did say that this is a 
matter for the court, with a right to appeal if bail is refused. However she has little confidence in the Swedish 
system which "has decayed since the mid-1970s. The judges arc totally different types now. If I was prosecuted 
I would not choose a chief judge." She suggested that judges have less independence now that their salary is 
decided by the chief judge. Shc then added that: "almost all Swedish lawyers think we have the best system in 
the world", but they are wrong. The decision as to whether the trial would take place in private would be made 
by the court. However she knows of no case where a rape trial has taken place in public. Article 6 has been 
incorporated into Swedish law. Shc agreed that after the case the judge decides whether evidence will be 
published, but suggested that only the court's conclusion must be published. 
The witness was further cross-examined about the authority to issue the F.AW. Again she had difficulty directly 
answering the question. However she did eventually say that if the decision to prosecute has been made then Ms 
Ny is entitled to issue the EAW. She then referred to the decision to prosecute, for which the Swedish is 
"Atalsbeslut". When pressed as to the decision to issue an arrest warrant and what it involves she said: "I may 
be wrong". When further matters about the EAW and the framework decision were put to her she said "I am 
clueless. I don't know. I have no firm opinion. [as to the points that must be reached before a prosecutor issues 
an F.AW for the purpose of prosecution]." 
She was then asked about her strong criticism of Ms Ny. She doesn't know her personally but it is the witness's 
view that the prosecutor is malicious. That is based on what she has said. Shc was then referred to the one 
example that she had exhibited to demonstrate that malice. This is from an article entitled "Securing evidence 
quickly is important for prosecutors" at page 13 behind tab 9. She was taken through the early paragraphs and 
accepted that there was nothing really wrong with what was said there. Shc was then taken to the main passage 
of which complaint was made, where it says: "Marianne Ny is of the opinion that such proceedings (criminal 
prosecutions) have a beneficial effect in protecting women, even in cases where perpetrators are prosecuted but 
not convicted". She appeared to understand this passage as saying that everyone who is prosecuted is guilty and 
had difficulty in accepting that another interpretation is simply that there are occasions when a man is prosecuted 
and, for whatever reason, acquitted even though he may have been guilty. She did not appear to accept that
