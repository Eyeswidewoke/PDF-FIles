agreement on a 5,000 acre development in North Carolina where the owners ne=d management and they need the 
ability to attract some money on a last-in, first-out basis, and we are closely following a half dozen other distressed=20 
properties. 
=AO 
1= order to meet our negative cash requirements, we have exhausted our cash reserve, we have scrambled 
where possible, and I have borrowed over $1=20 million personally and put it into the company. A few month= ago, a 
government bank for the eastern Caribbean, originally started by the World Bank, agreed to loan Landmark $5 million. 
The sec=rity for the loan would be the 100% of the St. Lucia company that owns one-third of Apes Hill Club in Barbados. 
That one=third interest is worth somewhere between $20 million and $50 million; however, it is not the type =f security 
that you can leverage in the U.S. I am told tha= this loan has been approved by the Board of Directors and I will be able 
to draw funds the fir=t of June; however, since I have received no written confirmation of this to-dat=, I am naturally 
concerned. 
=AO 
How I Would Like to Use Your Mind — If Allowed 
=AO 
1. 
If I obtain the $5 million loan, the q=estion before the house is how to position Landmark to create the 
maximum value from its reputation, its management team, and its $153 million tax loss. Whi=e I am a real estate man 
and know little of financial posturing, the best idea I have heard is to use Landmar= as a platform company to become a 
leader in the management and resurrection of=a few of these foreclosed assets, and in 5 to 7 years when the profits can 
be=20 realized from this financial disaster, with the tax loss used and the reput=tion enhanced, to go public as a branded 
community developer much as Ritz-Carlto= and Four Seasons are thought of as branded hotel operators. The=idea 
would be to have an institution or individual, or institutions and individuals, invest $15 million to $20=20 million in 
convertible preferred stock in Landmark. If afte= 3 years they decided to convert, they would own approximately the 
same amount as the Barton family,=20 however, this is simply one of I am sure many ways it could be done and I k=ow 
no one who, if you were willing, could give me better guidance. 
2. 
If, in fact, my unfounded worries about the=20 consummation of this $5 million loan are justified, I will 
need to very qui=kly see if I can borrow $3 million to $5 million on the one-third security of A=es Hill and be able to keep 
the management team together for perhaps another=20 year. If that is not possible, I will quickly reduce the staff to 
those necessary for the operations that we=20 have, substantially diminish my hope of being a leader in restructuring 
the=e distressed resorts, and borrow what I can from my friends to survive the en= of this crisis. 
=AO 
J=ffrey, if you are still reading this all too long email, I congratulate you on your focus. For the last six months 
we have been following many distressed properties and compiled it in=o what I call the "Zombie Book", which is 
updated monthly. If you have sufficient interest that you would like to look at some of the projects being followed, I 
would be very =appy to send it to you. 
=AO 
R=gardless of the above, please suggest a date in early June when it would be convenient for me to come see 
you.
