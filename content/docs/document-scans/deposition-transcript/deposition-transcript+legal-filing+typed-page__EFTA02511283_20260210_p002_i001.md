Your family office needs=a daddy. children with good intentions are running around , sniping = nitpicking with little 
direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggest=ng , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would report to him. 
Eileen include=. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot=C2 my first choice as I prefer only being 
responsible and standin= behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will=no longer be transmitted to reflect 
status stated by others ) =C2 
With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to d= it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to =hink 
through the problem creatively . My organizations handling of the more complex issues = believe you might find very 
costly, very ! ( however ma=y structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but=would require my teams 
doing the w=rk , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, =rat administrator. not sure what role you prefer for Eile=n as 
you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether R=ch your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom 
rep=rt to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam=C2 Kathy Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The 
incr=asing public profile needs to be taken into consideration. 
=br> 
TODAY 
With your acquiesence , Eilee= did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly =AO to me), she continued to 
provide bad info to both you ( cash flo=s , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each =ime with my many 
annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards t=at she was g 
y !! No one was hired to run YOUR office until two 
=onths ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very=nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours 
upon hours of time n=ed to be spent training him . and his new staff. Eileen followed yo=r instructions. not mine. in fact 
she continued to ignore mine sayin= " but Leon said " or " its on Leon's =esk etc " , You would become frustrated 
when i pointed o=t each instance. of her obfuscation. originally you were given the =tear choice, but to save money 
,you chose not to hire my team = I was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with =A0Eileen at the 
head. instructions were given by me„ detailed=C2 but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted mysel= 
and personally had to do the weeks of grunt work ),ex.=C2 jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, =C2 If you 
do the cold calculation ,starting from where you w=re, to where you are currently . you have made a hell o= a deal. --
negotiating down my original amount requeste= , calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Ca=lyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specifi= example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide yo= the 
name of the most highly recognized atty in the field,=not consulted,nor even asked again for my gu=dance along the 
way. ). I accepted the discount as your frien=. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your Tom is now t=at last word on 
tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however -=C2 that is all in the past. 
=AO In order to move forward 
I would ask that you realize that ve=y unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my pers=nal attention and my 
personal time . Time that I was for=ed to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As=you are my very 
close friend I will not have you participate in a bi=ding process that I have decided i will have this year for my =ime . 
(hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also a=k that you keep in mind that though our deal expired months 
ago. (al=o keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final payment ter=s neither reflected the emails or my 
memory, we finished it up your way. )= I have answered every call Brad , joslin, Ada or you= have made . reviewed docs 
over and over/ until once again, I =as forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it =angerous not to. I made serious 
dollar and time concessions last yea=.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your c=ncerns , but 
I am, under no circumstances , none, willin= to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's m=ss , 
which was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We w=re both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself=last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness. and tho=e very circumstances I took extra 
care in our negotiations . (you ha= claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in wi=h my very close 
friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautiou= ,in the near future, another barrel will appear of your own 
design=C2 ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had =Iready been paid for the work that is now required. The art partnership 
ha= fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obliga=ions and more so.. =AO( FYI Carlyns =rt partnership 
that you referenced is similar in only its =AOtitle. ) You wi=l also recall that you required that my payments be at the 
end of my=work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was never to =C2 include hours upon hours of 
training your staff). I eventually =greed, this of course should make clear that the=C2 2014 tax year that will close Oct 
2015 is not covered by our p=st agreement at all. I pointed this very fact out to you when I initially =roposed a multi
