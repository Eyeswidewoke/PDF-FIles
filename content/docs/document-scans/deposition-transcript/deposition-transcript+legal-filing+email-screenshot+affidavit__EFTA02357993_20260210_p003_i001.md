then either the former popular set theory or group theory of the 20th century . where for example mc would be 
contained in a larger category. ( your Merge would fall into a subcategory of operations that were a combination of 
associative , transitive operations in a space etc . One then looks at the spaces of probabilities and realizes that some 
are just much more probable than others . nothing more. these probabilities generate shapes only as a result of their 
statistical ensembles. - the age old study of soap bubbles suffered from the same handicap.. the shapes were 
analyzed by attempting to follow the mc rule. ie containing the most volume for the least area. ( a broader category ) 
now i would propose that the shape merely represents its most probable shape- nothing more. given the statistical 
space. for ex, things on the membrane , free to move but the shape not changing. 
I understand that language is not 
an input output system like vision. Shapes are not input /output devices but have very strong properties, relationships 
etc. there are mappings onto those spaces. the old version of functions expanded ei using more than only 
mathematical terms. mappings are not required to be linear. ie grammatical sentences would be represented as 
coherent shapes. its very beautiful math. 
Had dinner with woody and he wanted to know if valeria had gotten the book he suggested as in hindsight thought that 
he should have sent her a copy and not merely forwarded the title. my side still hurts from laughing for the past 2 
hours.

If I understand what you're saying, I agree. If I want to buy something, the gold is more valuable (thanks to conventions 
of the social order). If I'm hungry, the food has higher value than the gold (independent of such conventions). But I'm 
not sure I see what follows.

Subject: 
there is gold in the refrigerator. there is food in the refriegerator.. , 1. does either the physical gold or food have 
more intrinsic value.? . depends . is the value the same to both owner and , consumer.? depends, need , time frame ? 
if so how does one calculate it. what if there is more than two players. 2 exchangability ( first order derivative ) not 
the thing itself but what one can do with it. - it depends 3. the piece of pape or hunk of useless metal that "states" 
there is gold in the fridg ? is that money. ?you get the idea does there have to be actual gold in the fridge for it to be 
accepeted by others of something of "value". ( depends on trust and belief system ). yesterdays question - If the 
sentence " there is gold in the fridge " is either spoken or written . does that change its value? . buyer, seller, trust 
,belief system ?
