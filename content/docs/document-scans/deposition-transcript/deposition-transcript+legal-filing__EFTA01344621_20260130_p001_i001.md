Hypothetical Examples or 
))))) ars Payable at Maturity 
The following examples illustrate how the total returns set forth in the table above arc calculated. 
Example 1: The Reference Currency depreciates from the Initial Spot Rate of 1.9619 to a hypothetical Final Spot Rate of 2.0600. Because the 
Reference Cum:my Return of -5.00°. is greater than the Barrier Level of -15.00%, the investor receives a Payment at Maturity of $1,000 per 51,000 
Principal Amount of Notes. 
Example 2: The Reference Currency appreciates from the Initial Spot Rate of 1.9619 to a hypothetical Final Spot Rate of 1.9227. Because the 
Reference Currency Return of 2.00°. is greater than 0.00% but less than 3.00... the investor reeeik 
Payment at Maturity of 51.050.00 per 51.000 
Principal Amount of Notes. 
Example 3: The Reference Currency appreciates from the Initial Spot Rate of 1.9619 to a hy pothelical Final Spot Rate of 1.3733. Because the 
Reference Currency Return of 30.00% is greater than 3.00%. the investor receives a Payment at Maturity of 51.285.00 per 51000 Principal Amount of 
Notes. In no case will the investor participate in any appreciation of the Reference Currency beyond 28.50%. 
Example 4: The Reference Currency depreciates from the Initial Spot Rate of 1.9619 to a hypothetical Final Spot Rate of 2.7467. Because the 
Reference Currency Return of -40.00°. is less than the Barrier Level of -15.00%, the investor is exposed to the negative performance of the Reference 
Currency. The investor will receive a Payment at Maturity of 5600.00 per 51.000 Principal Amount of Notes. calculated as follows: 
51.000 ♦ (51.000 . .40.00%) - 5600.00
