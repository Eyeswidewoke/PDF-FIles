Re: Sexual harassment and Lawrence Krauss from 
I =as planning on writing both of you today or tomorrow if buzzfeed =ecided to go ahead with their story after I wrote to 
them, but since =hey sent this to you here is what I was planning to forward.. namely my =esponse to their email and 
their original email. I hope it =elps. They have clearly decided in advance to try to smear me, =nd potentially other 
atheists (I found the remarks in their =E244miscellaneous facts' telling in this regard), and I =elt a detailed response to 
the false claims was important. If you =ant to discuss this further I am happy to. I am currently on a plane =eading to 
phoenix. 
Thanks for forwarding.

I appreciate the opportunity to =espond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific =ime, and 
then heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm =r so. While I am running the risk that you will report my 
=omments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am =esponding with an effort to be complete, as I always 
try and do with =eporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after =eading my responses, I hope you decide 
is inappropriate, I would like =ou to quote my responses fully in order not to distort them. =nbsp; 
It is =ard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted =negations, along with misleading 
statements. I treat people I interact =ith with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, =olleagues, and 
members of the general public, and this is supported by =he institutions of which I am a part. I do not sexually harass 
=eople. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that =niversities and other institutions are lax in dealing 
with well known =ndividuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the =pposite. My high public profile opens me 
up to more scrutiny at =hese institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of =nfounded outside complaints 
and allegations that other faculty do not =eceive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact =hat I have 
remained a professor in all Universities with which I have =een associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an 
invited =peaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment =olicies, is a confirmation of the fact that their 
experience validates = trust in my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of =FI, and continue to be invited to 
their last 3 meetings to speak, =pecifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the =ttendees universally
