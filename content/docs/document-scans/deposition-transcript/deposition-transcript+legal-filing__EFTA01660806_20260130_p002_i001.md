NJ.com (11/24, Sheldon) reported that Soaulb Butcher, a 31-year-old Brooklyn man, was sentenced to 10 years and one month in prison for sex 
trafficking a 14-year-old girl from a New Jersey group home. According to the article, Butcher pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit sex

The New York Times (11/24, Feuer, Goldman, et al.) reported that Director Patel is facing mounting scrutiny over allegations that he has misused 
federal resources for personal purposes, including deploying FBI SWAT teams to provide security for his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins, 
at concerts and public appearances, a practice former FBI officials describe as highly irregular. According to the article, Director Patel has also 
been criticized for his frequent use of government jets for what appear to be personal trips, including golf outings, a Scotland excursion, and visits 
to a private Texas hunting ranch, raising concerns about excessive and potentially improper taxpayer-funded travel. The article noted that the 
controversy intensified after Director Patel was seen in Las Vegas during the Fl Grand Prix, where a bystander shouted at him to "release the 
Epstein files," reflecting growing public frustration with his handling of matters related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The incident occurred 
days after President Donald Trump signed legislation ordering the DOJ and FBI to unseal additional Epstein-related records. Critics, ranging from 
former FBI agents to online commentators, argue that Director Patel's actions represent an abuse of authority and a troubling deviation from 
established federal protocols, prompting calls for oversight and accountability. Additional reporting was provided by Independent (11/24, Keane)
