PRIVILEGED - ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT/DELIBERATIVE PROCESS 
CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO FED. R. CRIM. P. 6(e) 
I. Background and Ownership of Property 
On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned an 
indictment (the "Indictment") charging Jeffrey Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Beginning in at least 2002, Epstein enticed and recruited dozens 
of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash. He undertook this activity in several locations, including his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the "Palm Beach 
Residence"). 
Between 1962 and 1989, prior to Epstein's ownership, the New York Residence was 
operated as a school, under the auspices of the Birch Wathen Lenox School (the "Birch School"). 
In 1989, the Birch School sold the property to the Nine East 71st Street Corporation, which at the 
time was wholly owned by Leslie Wexner, the billionaire founder of the Limited Company.2 In 
or about 1998, Wexner agreed to sell the New York Residence to Epstein for $20 million. We 
believe the change of ownership occurred through a transfer of control of the Nine East 71st Street 
Corporation, the LLC that had purchased the New York Residence in 1989. Documents we have 
reviewed reflect that in 2011, ownership of the New York Residence was transferred from one 
Epstein-controlled entity to another: from Nine East 71st Street Corporation, of which Epstein was 
President, to Maple, Inc? The New York Residence is valued at approximately $55-86 million, 
and its parent company owner is herein referred to as the "Corporation.s4
2 From approximately the early 1990s through 2007, Epstein managed certain finances and 
financial projects for Wexner, including through having power of attorney for Wexner; it also 
appears that Epstein stole or otherwise misappropriated more than $100 million from Wexner, in 
addition to receiving other fees in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars during the duration 
of their decades-long financial relationship. 
3 Relevant documents list Epstein as the President of the Nine East 71st  Street Corporation, and 
no other officers or members are listed in those documents. Accordingly, 
this memorandum assumes for its analysis that Epstein was 
the sole member of the Nine East 71st Street Corporation during the relevant time period of 
approximately 2002 through 2005. 
4 We have obtained ownership paperwork for the New York Residence that suggests Epstein was 
the sole owner or member of these entities. Moreover, neither entity appears to have had a bank 
account or other indicia of operating costs, employees, etc. Additionally, Epstein also owned 
domestic properties during the relevant period including residences in Florida, New Mexico, and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, at which he engaged in criminal conduct. Each of those properties is 
owned by a separate corporation, respectively, for which Epstein is the sole member, and none of 
which appears to have a bank account or other indicia of operations or employees. While Epstein 
did have employees working at each of those locations, these employees were generally paid out 
of a separate operating account controlled by Epstein, not directly by the LLC that owned the 
h sical pro
