Article VIII 
Miscellaneous Provisions 
Section 8.1. - Representation of Person Under a Disability 
To the extent allowed by law, where a party to any proceeding with respect to any trust 
hereunder has the same interest as a person under a disability, legal process on the person under a 
disability may be dispensed with. 
Section 8.2. - Simultaneous Deaths 
If a Beneficiary under this Trust Agreement and I die simultaneously or under such 
circumstances that it is difficult to determine who died first, then for all purposes of this 
Agreement such Beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me. 
Section 8.3.- Law Governing 
This trust agreement and the trust created by it shall in all respects and for all purposes be 
governed and regulated by the laws of the Territory of the United States Virgin Islands, as they 
now exist and may from time to time be enacted, amended, or repealed. All questions regarding 
the validity, construction and administration of this trust agreement, or any of its provisions, and 
of this trust shall be determined solely by the laws of that Territory. The courts of the State of 
Delaware and the U.S. Virgin Islands shall have primary supervision over the administration of 
this trust. It is intended that this trust shall be a U.S. domestic trust as defined in Title 26 section 
7701(aX30) of the Code by virtue of meeting the court and control test. As provided in Treas. 
Reg. section 301.7701-7(c)(4)(D), if both a United States court and a foreign court are able to 
exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust, the trust meets the court test. 
Each trust hereby created shall in all respects be regulated by the laws of the United 
States Virgin Islands. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, my Trustee of 
each trust created under this Agreement has discretion at any time or times following my death to 
transfer the situs of such trust to such other country, or such other jurisdiction as my Trustee 
determines, without obtaining judicial authorization or approval (unless such judicial 
authorization or approval is requited by applicable law) and without the filing of any bond. My 
Trustee's determination to transfer the situs of any trust under this Agreement shall be evidenced 
by an instrument in writing signed, witnessed and acknowledged by my Trustee in the same 
manner as would be required for a deed. My Trustee is authorized to take whatever actions are 
necessary to effect such a transfer of situs. If judicial authorization or approval is required to 
effect such a transfer of situs, I intend and desire that the appropriate court accept the 
determination of my Trustee concerning the transfer of the situs of such trust even if one or more 
Beneficiaries disagree with such determination. From and after my Trustee's transfer of the situs 
of a trust pursuant to this Section 8.3 of Article VIII, the administration of such trust shall be 
governed by the law of the new situs of such trust.
