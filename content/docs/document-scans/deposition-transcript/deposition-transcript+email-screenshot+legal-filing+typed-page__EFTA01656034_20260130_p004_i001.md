for tips comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order protecting children from these procedures, 
which he described as "destructive and life-altering". The article added that Erica Knight, an advisor to Director 
Patel, told The Daily Wire that the bureau will "never stop fighting for our most vulnerable — our children. As a 
mother, I'm deeply grateful and proud to know the future of America's kids is one rooted in safety, strength, and 
opportunity." The FBI posted the following on X on Monday: "Help the FBI protect children. As the Attorney 
General has made clear, we will protect our children and hold accountable those who mutilate them under the 
guise of gender-affirming care." The post encouraged Americans to "report tips of any hospitals, clinics, or 
practitioners performing these surgical procedures on children." 
As Ousters Continue, FBI Singles Out Employee Over Friendship With Trump Critic 
The New York Times (06/05, Goldman) reported that the FBI has forced out two veteran agents, Spencer Evans and 
Stanley Meador, and punished another, Michael Feinberg, due to their perceived disloyalty to President Trump. The 
article noted that Michael Feinberg was targeted for his friendship with Peter Strzok, a critic of President Trump, 
and was threatened with an investigation and demotion. "I was informed that, because I maintain a friendship with 
a former FBI executive who is a critic and perceived enemy of the current administration, I would not be receiving 
any of the promotions for which I was currently being considered, and that I should actually steel myself to be 
demoted," he said. Feinberg added that the FBI had intended to have him take a polygraph, or a lie-detector test, 
about the nature of his ties to Strzok, which he said are entirely social. The article assessed that the moves are seen 
as part of a larger effort by Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino to remake the agency and mollify Trump's 
supporters, with critics accusing them of politicizing the FBI and retaliating against employees who disagree with 
them. 
Continued Reporting: Director Patel, a Longtime Bureau Critic, Begins to Put His Stamp on the Agency 
NPR (06/05, Lucas) reported that Director Patel, a former critic of the agency, has begun to implement changes 
since taking the helm over 100 days ago, including redeploying agents and analysts from Washington, D.C. to field 
offices across the country. The article explained that Director Patel and his deputy, Dan Bongino, are shifting the 
FBI's focus from traditional law enforcement work to immigration enforcement, with most field offices now 
working on immigration cases. A spokesman for the FBI, Ben Williamson, said the agency does not comment on 
specific personnel decisions. But he added that the bureau's "agents and support staff are dedicated professionals 
working around the clock to defend the homeland and crush violent crime — a mission which certainly overlaps 
with the consequences of the previous administration's open border policies for four years." The article added that 
the new leadership has also disbanded the premier public corruption squad, which investigated public officials, and 
is instead prioritizing cases such as the pipe bombs found near the Capitol and the leak of the Supreme Court's 
Dobbs decision. "We come in in the morning, there's a portfolio of 100 level 10 items. If it's a level nine, which is a 
pretty big frickin' deal, someone else fixed it," Deputy Director Bongino told Fox's Maria Bartiromo in a joint sit-
down interview with Director Patel last month. "The only thing that gets to my desk or his is a level 10. That's the 
entire day." In that same interview, Director Patel said his priorities for the bureau were crushing violent crime, 
defending the homeland, rigorous constitutional accountability, and aggressive constitutional oversight with 
Congress. He also has promised a "wave of transparency," including on the investigation into possible ties between 
the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia and the death of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Daily Mail (06/05, 
Spiering) reported that Deputy Director Bongino claims to have video evidence proving Jeffrey Epstein's death was 
a suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Bongino says the video shows Epstein was alone in his 
cell and that guards checked on him regularly, with no one else entering the area. He conceded the Epstein case 
was "a hot potato for folks" but also cautioned people against putting too much emphasis on the video he was 
preparing to release. "It's not the greatest video in the world. I don't want to set expectations on fire." Additional 
reporting on the story was provided by The Independent (06/OS, Bedigan), New York Post (06/OS, Norman), The 
Epoch Times (06/OS, Phillips), and Washington Examiner (06/05, Notheis).
