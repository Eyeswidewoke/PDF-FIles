deposited upon receipt. Our acceptance of an 
mein marked with a restrictive legend will not operate as an accord and 
satisfaction without our express poor wntten approval. Authorization for Electronic Debit: We will process checirs 
electronically, at first presentment and any re-presentments, by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number, 
account number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the checks not processable electronically or a 
less costly process is available. By 5d: ending a check for payment, you authorize us to initiate an electronic debt from your 
bank or asset account. When we process your check electronically, your payment may be debited to your bank or asset 
account as soon as the same day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your bank or 
asset account statement. If we cannot collect the funds electronically we may issue a raft against your bank or asset

or any other electronic payment service of ours, you will be authorizing us to initiate an eledronic debit to the financial

day. Allocation ot Payments and Credits: Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits 
among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our soW discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to calculate FC on your Account Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Penodc Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as descnbed below) for each Feature ((including current transactions). Different daily
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADS for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (inaductng unpaid FC from previous billing periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the brat day of the 
period, we also add an amount of marmot equal to the previous daYs daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balances negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
bring period and dvde the total by the number of days in the being period. Thisgives us the ADB for the Feature. If you pay 
the New Balance on the statement by the next Closing Date then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in the billing period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FG assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding The total FC for the 
Whiny period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account This method of calculating the ADB 
and FC results in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a 
foreign curr
, it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use br a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified 
customary banking sources, on the 
conversion date or the poor business day, in each Instance Increased 
(except for transactions processed 
blivii ig
k
prior to 01/11/09, Increased by 2%). This conversion rate may &Her from rates in effect on the date of your charge
