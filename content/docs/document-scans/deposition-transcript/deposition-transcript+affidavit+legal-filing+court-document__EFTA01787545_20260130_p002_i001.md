still not that wonderfully written. 
who lives in =msterdam. 
could be arranged either here or there. 
2. = can send some recent things on the topic of placebo response, which =re 
3. If interested in exploring =nvesting in EB, I can put you in touch with Adriaan, 
Are =ny of these appealing? I prefer 1 to 2. I think a face to =ace version of 3 
let me =now.

Hello Jeffrey, 
I'm glad that Martin has put us in touch for a =ouple of reasons. First, I think we 
have some mutual interests =oncerning the complications of doing experiments with humans, rather =han plants or 
animals or tires. One complication is noncompliance =ith the assigned treatment, which we briefly discussed at the 
dinner, =ut the more interesting one is the placebo effect, which can be =igantic, for example in "viagra" type studies, 
which we =idn't get around to discussing except indirectly in the context =f the Emotional Brain (EB) female viagra issue. 
More generally, this is related to FDA standards for =pproving drugs. A slight 
aside: in January I'm one of =hree people getting honorary degrees from the Medical Faculty of the =niversity of 
Uppsala in Sweden, where one of the others is Robert =aliff, the current Commissioner of the FDA (the other is Marcia 
McNutt, =he current President of the National Academy of Sciences), so I should =et the chance to bend his ear at 
various meals (a former commissioner =E24$ under Bush II — was a partial PhD student of mine when =e was getting 
his MD at Harvard and his PhD in Econ at MIT, and remains = good friend: Mark McClellen, who is interested in this stuff 
and =emains quite influential in DC, I think). 
But the reason for rambling about the FDA and placebo =ffects is the following. 
This morning I just had an exchange of =mails with the CEO of EB, whom I've known and worked with for =bout three 
years, Adriaan Tuiten. He wrote that FDA has agreed =ith EB's proposal for more trials, and the EB board of =irectors 
just approved the issuance of about 12 million Euros in stock =o pay for these trials. Adriaan thinks that they may have 
enough =onnections now, but would you be interested in participating? I =lready have some stock, which I earned 
though consulting. I =hink EB is interesting but still needs more wisdom when it comes to =heir statistics (I've been to 
FDA with them two or three times, =nd I think they still need help with some of their ideas e.g., using =NPs). If 
interested in tossing some money their way, let me =now. 
In any case, I very much enjoyed our last conversations, and = look forward to 
seeing you again, either in Cambridge or in NYC, which ='II probably get to in the next couple of weeks. 
Best wishes, Don
