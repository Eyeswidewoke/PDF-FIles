but heighten "the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might otherwise be o=scured," the 
justices wrote. A single biased individual "m=ght still have an influence that, while not so visible ... is =evertheless 
significant." 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the=inspector general, 
there is a strong circumstantial case—including=personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire 
was initiated for political, not national-security, purposes.=/u> 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Departmen= presumption against 
investigating campaigns in an election year. And whil= impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-Attorney 
General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is =80 particularly important in an election year," and "pol=tics must 
play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investig=tors regarding any investigations. . . . Law enforcement 
officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative step= or criminal charges for the purpose of 
affecting any election, or for the=purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or politic=l party." 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the =ase with the bureau's 
investigation of Mrs. Clinton's priv=te email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But 
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counter=ntelligence investigation predicated on the notion that 
Russia could be co=luding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no discernible =vidence of Trump-
Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing the notion that it=was initiated "for the purpose" 
of affecting the president=al election. 
The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic=National Committee's 
servers. But nothing in the public record sug=ests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative 
therefore hinges on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed=to help Mr. Trump's election, and that the Trump 
campaign reciproc=ted by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance an= investigation, there's still 
no public evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to sow po=itical discord by undermining Mrs. 
Clinton and to a lesser extent Mr. Trum=. 
Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advo=ated dovish 
policies. But so did numerous American political and academic =lites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential 
campaigns routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign pow=rs. The Clinton campaign funded the Steele 
dossier, whose British author p=id Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta Group, led by the brother=of Mrs. 
Clinton's campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for Russia's largest bank and the Europ=an Center for a Modern 
Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties. The Clinton F=undation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected 
businesses..u> 
No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Muell=r has yet to bring 
collusion-related charges against anyone. Evidence sugg=sts one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured to 
London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damagi=g to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to dinner, where he 
drunkenly bragged that he=E2 d heard about such dirt but never seen it. These circumstances not=only fail to suggest 
Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment. The source of this information, former A=stralian 
diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr. Papadopolous never mentione= emails, destroying any reasonable inference of 
a connection between the D=C hack and the Trump campaign. 
Crossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question= If Russia promised unspecified 
dirt on Mrs. Clinton but never delivered i=, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If anything, 
such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and pot=ntially embarrass Mr. Trump by dangling the prospect of 
compromising infor=ation and getting his aides to jump at it. 
Given the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the =BI would initiate a 
counterintelligence investigation, led by politically =iased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods
