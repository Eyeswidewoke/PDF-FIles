The Washington Post (10/19, Nakashima, Barrett, 14.2M) reports FBI Deputy Director 
David Bowdich said the charges show that "time and again, Russia has made it clear they will 
not abide by accepted norms and instead they intend to continue their destructive and 
destabilizing cyber behavior." 
Reuters (10/19, Stubbs, Bing) reports, "U.S. officials would not say whether the timing of 
the announcement just ahead of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election was intended to serve as a 
warning to foreign, government-linked hacking groups." However, Jeff Pegues said on the CBS 
Evening NewsVi (10/19, story 4, 1:50, O'Donnell, 4.4M) the Justice Department's action "is 
widely seen as a warning to Russia. The message, stay out of the US election." 
The New York Times (10/19, Schmidt, Perlroth, 18.61M) reports, "It was unclear whether 
the Russian officers would stand trial for the charges." While Moscow "is highly unlikely to hand 
them over to be prosecuted," the charges "could potentially restrict their travels, and they could 
be arrested if they enter a country willing to turn them over to the United States." 
CNN (10/19, Carrega, 83.16M) reports, "The alleged hackers are officers of the Russian 
Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), a military intelligence agency of the General Staff of the 
Armed Forces. Monday's charges allege some of the most consequential political attacks levied 
by the Kremlin since its efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election, including the 
hacking of Democratic Party email accounts." CNN adds, "The United States District Court for 
the Western District of Pennsylvania issued a federal arrest warrant for each of these 
defendants upon the grand jury's return of the indictment. They are all charged in seven 
counts: conspiracy to conduct computer fraud and abuse, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire 
fraud, damaging protected computers, and aggravated identity theft." 
The Washington Times (10/19, Mordock, 492K) reports, "Several of the countries targeted 
had blamed the Russian government for the hacks. However, this is the first time officials have 
targeted Russia for the attacks through criminal indictments. `As this case shows, no country 
has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously and irresponsibly as Russia, wantonly 
causing unprecedented damage to pursue small tactical advantages to satisfy fits of spite,' 
Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers told reporters at a press 
conference announcing the charges." 
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (10/19, Ove, 616K) reports, "Among the victims in 2017 were 
Heritage Valley Health System in Western Pennsylvania, which spent $2 million to repair 
damage by the malware, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said at a Monday news conference in 
Washington, D.C." Brady "and other officials said the Russian officers are part of the same unit 
that the Justice Department said attempted to disrupt the 2016 election and the 2018 Olympics 
after Russian athletes had been banned for doping. The Justice Department said defendants, all 
former or current members of Unit 74455 based in Moscow, unleashed the NotPetya malware. 
The attacks caused nearly $1 billion in losses to three victims alone that are mentioned in the 
indictment. In addition to Heritage Valley, they are TNT Express B.V. (a FedEx subsidiary) and 
an unnamed U.S. pharmaceutical maker that paid $500 million to fix the damage." 
Politico (10/19, Geller, 4.29M) reports, "As officers of Russia's GRU military intelligence 
agency, the six defendants launched a June 2017 malware campaign known as NotPetya, 
hacked the Ukrainian power grid in 2015 and 2016, and conducted the hack-and-leak 
operations that targeted the 2017 French elections, according to a newly unsealed indictment. 
NotPetya, which began in Ukraine, quickly escaped, causing devastating losses for companies 
around the world. The shipping giant Maersk saw its entire operation temporarily collapse as 
the malware locked up its computer systems. A White House report estimated the malware's 
total damages at $10 billion, according to Wired. It was the most destructive and widespread 
malware outbreak in history." 
Reuters (10/19, Stubbs, Bing) quotes Bowdich saying, "The FBI has repeatedly warned 
that Russia is a highly capable cyber adversary, and the information revealed in this indictment 
illustrates how pervasive and destructive Russia's cyber activities truly are."
