transcripts and tapes, which we hope to share with you in person, will likely present a very 
different view of those interviews taken afterwards. 
Therefore. in the interest of truth. we ask you to review the transcripts. compare them to 
the FBI reports upon which the indictment was predicated. and then determine whether the FBI 
summaries and the prosecution memorandum upon which the charging decisions were made • 
overstate Mr. Epstein's federal culpability. Concomitant to these requests. we would ask that 
you determine whether the investigative team ever proVided these trustworthy tapes and 
transcripts to those in your Ofiiee who were being asked to authorize the prosecution so that they 
could themselves assess the reliability of the MN interview reports against a verbatim record of 
the same witness's prior statements. We believe that this request is Bair and would not be unduly 
burdensome. 
II. 
THE IMPROPER INVM.VEMF.NT AND CONDUCT OF FEDERAL 
IORITIES. 
As established above. the State's charging decision. of one count of the solicitation of 
prostitution, was hardly irrational or irreµular. 
Indeed. Lana Belohlavek. a Florida sex 
prosecutor for 13 years. concluded that the women in question were prostitutes and that "there 
arc no victims here.-  There was no evidence of violenete force. drugs. alcohol, coercion or au 
abuse or a position of authority. Each and every one of the alleged 'victims" knew what to 
expect when they arrived at Mr. Epstein's house and each was paid for her services. In fact. Mr. 
Epstein's message book establishes that many of these women routinely scheduled massage 
sessions with Mr. Epstein themselves. without any prompting. Ms. Belohlavek also noted that 
many of these individuals worked either as exotic dancers or in one of then 
ge parlors 
dotted across West Palm Beach. Ms. Belohlavek also specifically stated that 
could not 
be trusted and was "only interested in money." She further found that it was nappropriate for 
Mr. Epstein to register as a sex offender because she did not believe that he constituted a threat 
to young girls and because registration had not been required in similar or even more serious 
cases. Ms. Mollie vak thought. and still believes, that the appropriate punishment is a term of 
probation. 
Yet. the government has devoted an extraordinary amount of its time and resouretz to 
prosecute Mr. Epstein for conduct the State believes amounts to a "sex for money-  case. While 
we are loathe to singlu-out for criticism the conduct of any particular professional, we cannot 
escape the conclusion that the cumulative effect of the conduct of Assistant United States 
Attorney 
led your Office to take positions during the investigation and 
ne sotiation of this matter that has led to unprecedented Ibderal overreaching. In Incl. 
states " . . .the federal authorities inappropriately involved themselves to t e 
investigation y the state authorities and employed highly irregular and coercive tactics to 
override the judgment of state low 
eis authorities as to the appropriate disposition of 
their case against your client." See 
letter faxed to you on December 7. 2007.
