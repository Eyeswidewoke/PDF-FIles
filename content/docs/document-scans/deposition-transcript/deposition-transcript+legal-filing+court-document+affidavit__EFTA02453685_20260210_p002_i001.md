no part in it, and the seeming futility in trying to provide sorely needed balance to a story that has been spun completely 
off its axis<=span>, Mr. Epstein and his representatives have deliberately remained s=lentnot given any interviews 
</=pan>about these events. In fact they have remained so quiet that So much so that in January 2015, Jean Luc Brunel, 
a modeling agent, long time friend of Mr Epstein, w=o is also unfairly and falsely reviled portrayed , without any 
evidence whatsoever, as a sex trafficker in 
abhorrent creation, sued Epstein for =ailing to publicly renounce 
these false allegations leveled against Epstein and him, including those perpetuated ball 
her book =span 
class=""> She makes wild acc=sations against an industry that legitimately hires young women to model. And =hrough 
her distorted lens turn evey modeling agent into a criminal. <=h1> 
With Epstein's silence and, for obvious reasons, a dearth of individuals willing to risk their own reputations to 
defend persons and offensive events depicted with ever increasing severity<=del>, a vacuum has been created to allow 
, a shameless and delusional self-promoter, to peddle to a voracious but unsuspecting public an infantil= 
distortion in the name of human rights. = 
'Trafficking" is a frighteningly irresponsible compilation =f untested 
fantastical allegations, unsupportable assumptions, shoddily pieced togethe= circumstantial evidence and paranoid 
speculation. It is poorly researched, carelessly sourced and alarmingly inaccurate. Though presented in s tyle that 
includes footnotes in most=chapters. Many =span class="">of which upon researching do not exist. 
Pages 94 through 108 of TrafficKing clearly establish that M, 
tells a tale of her havi=g recently been terrified 
during an investigation in Mexico into true sex traf=icking and government corruption, was already primed to accept as 
given a l=nk between sex trafficking and government corruption. She says she re=d a few articles in which the lawyers 
representing a =span class="">few women prosecuting in civil cases against Ep=tein where were trying to create public 
pressure on Epstein. What is clear fro= her narrative is that from the beginning she assumed the truth of every negativ= 
statement asserted against Epstein and his associates and as a result of her first hand experience of government 
corruption and s=x trafficking, immediately assumed similar conduct taking place in the Epstei= case. All the research 
she co=ducted thereafter was clearly informed by this pre-conceived a=d completely erroneous notion that Epstein's 
wealth and power were us=d to insulate him and his associates from the consequences of <=span>a serious 
criminal=activity. 
bias has made her recklessly indifferent to the truth in the Epstein case and singularly unwilling to 
exercise even a modic=m of critical analysis or objectivity. =She draws her "facts" and conclusions from very obviously 
biase= and unreliable sources without any scrutiny, due diligence or professional journalistic objectivity, choosing to 
accept without question any and all negative allegations against Mr. Epstein and his associates and to fully discard 
any=and all evidence that demonstrates an absence of credibility of her sources or =he implausibility of the information 
they provide. 
Consequently, in TrafficKing, Ms. 
has published a fabrication riddled with blatant defamation, particularly 
relating to the P=aintiffs, their relationships with Epstein and their involvement in the matters givin= rise to Mr. 
Epstein's legal problems. In fact, 
ignored clear warnings about the problems with her book, conc=ding at page 
xii-xiv that "publishers were afraid to print my book for f=ar of" libel and legal action and that 6 different publishers 
rejected her manuscr=pt. Acting with f=ll knowledge of her publishers skepticism and warnings and with clear malice i= 
the face of so many voices saying your story is inaccurate, 
should have heeded those warnings as the numerous 
defamatory statements in TrafficKing have severely and irreparably damaged the reputations of Plaintiffs, two innocents 
unfairly caught in its destructive wake.
