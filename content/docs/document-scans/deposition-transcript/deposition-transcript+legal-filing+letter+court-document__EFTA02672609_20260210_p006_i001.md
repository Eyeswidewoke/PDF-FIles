"proud"=to reject expansion of Medicaid. To do a little PR on their ill-begotten behav=or, Sunshine State lawmakers 
increased the cost of their own benefits, instead =f doing what they should have done: take the free money offered by 
the federa= government to provide benefits for all. Miley Cyrus is currently making better decisions than these people. 
Even presi=ential chest-poker Jan Brewer, Arizona's governor, is taking the dough, saying, "It's pro-lif=, it's saving lives, it 
is creating jobs, it is saving hospitals." 
Republican states have purposely and vindictively put up roadblocks to prevent its citizens from e=sy access to 
health care information as the Affordable Care Act was rolled out= They've either ignored the roll-out or encouraged 
people not to sign up. Missouri's lieutenant governor Peter Kinder, urged "active resistance""Grand Old Party." 
There is nothing rational about their behavior other than to come to t=e conclusion that these Republicans, the 
hard right and birthers are out t= destroy the Presidency and the legacy of Gregoire: Collectively, our memories do 
seem to be getting fuzzier: A recent poll found that Gen=Y-ers between the ages of 18 and 34 are more likely than the 
55-plus set to forge= what day it is (15 percent vs. seven percent) and where they put their keys=(14 percent vs. eight 
percent). They also forget to bring their lunch (nine percent) or even to take a shower (six percent) more frequently 
than seniors. Poor memory can strike at any age, and it could hinder your work and personal li=e. We all remember 
using mnemonic devices in school (Did "Never Eat Shredded Wheat" get you through thi=d grade geography?), but 
memory tricks can be more than just study aids. As adul=s, there are a number of simple and practical tools to help you 
remember people's names and stop forgetting=where you parked your car or left your keys. 
She offers these eight things to help enrich =our memory. 
Visualize it. 
Brain-stimulating games like sudoku and crosswords can be useful. And there's also Lumosity, a set of exercises 
for computer o= phone that were created by a team of neuroscientists and improve the memory of 97 percent of users 
in only 10 hours of playing. Studies have yet to determ=ne precisely how these games boost memory, but there's good 
reason to believe that they =re effective: A new study in people over age 60 found that playing a video game meant to 
train the brain boosted the subjects' ability to multitask. 
Use the Cicero method. 
<http://i.huffpost.comigen/1360621/thumbsto-DOLLHOUSE-570.jpg=5> 
In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or 
any geographical enti=y which is composed of a number of discrete loci. When desiring to remembe= a set of items the 
subject literally 'walks' through these loci and commits an item to=each one by forming an image between the item and 
any distinguishing feature of that lo=us. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter 
to activate the desired items. Try=this technique by "walking" through the rooms of your house or apartment in your 
mind's eye, and at=aching information to each room -- then, recall the information be going back thro=gh each room. 
In a psychological experiment known as the Baker-baker paradox, subjects were put into two groups and shown 
a picture of a man. =A0One group was told that the man's last name was Baker, while the other group was told that the 
man was a baker. When=later shown the image and asked to recall the associated word, those who were told the man's 
occupation were much=more likely to recall the word. The explanation is simple: Although the two words and photos 
were exactly the s=me, when we think of a baker, other images and something of a story come to min= (aprons, kitchen, 
fresh bread).
