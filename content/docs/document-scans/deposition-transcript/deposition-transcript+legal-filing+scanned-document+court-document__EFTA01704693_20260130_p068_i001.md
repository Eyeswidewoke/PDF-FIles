Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges:We use the Average Daily 
Balance method to calculate Finance Charges on your Account. Under this method, we figure the Finance Charges on your 
Account by applying the daly periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for each feature (such as 
Purchase Cash Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (inducting current transactions). To get the 
Average Daily Balance for each feature, we (1 take the beginning balance foe the feature each day (inducing unpaid 
Finance Charges from previous billing periods), (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) subtract any payments cr 
credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustmen s. For each day after the first day of the billing period we also 
add an amount of interest actual to the previous day's daiy balance multiplied by the dallY periodic rate 
for the feature. This gives us the daily balance for the feature 
 
forthat day and the beginning balance for the feature fcr 
the next day. If this ba ante is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the 
feature for the toeing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average 
Daily Balance for the feature. For all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance 
will be considered to be zero if you paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the 
Payment Due Date shown on that statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number 
of days in the billing period and the daily periodic rate for that feahne, the result will be the Finance Charge 
assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge for the billing period 
is calculated by adding the Finance Charges assessed on all features of the Account. This method of calculating the 
Average Daly Balance and Finance Charge results In daily compounding of Finance Charges. The minimum 
Finance Charge for any billing period in which Finance Charges are imposed is saw.
