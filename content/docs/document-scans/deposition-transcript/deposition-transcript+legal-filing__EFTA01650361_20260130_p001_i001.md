Subject: Outstanding Items - Epstein 
Date: Sun, 20 Oct 2019 12:22:12 +0000 
Importance: Normal 
Good Morning Ladies, 
I hope you don't see this until Monday and you had a fabulous time at 
Just to let you know, I did 
move some items into the Epstein folder and created a new subfolder in travel for VSD staff. I've put a few 
hours in over the weekend so far and wanted you both to be aware of the outstanding items I can think of: 
• Sharepoint for EVAFs - I put in all of the airline information and will work on the lodging accommodations 
today. 
o Outstanding items I need from Miami: 
• 
and 
train ticket 
• Victim folders w/brochures, NY CVC, and trauma-informed counseling options by AOR (I'll send out a 
separate email to VSs to see if they can assist) 
• Security Information 
o It looks like a number of individuals sent information in on Friday afternoon. It didn't have a 
checkmark on it, 
so I'm just making sure you're aware so nothing is missed. 
• New Individuals Attending 
o Per 
s email (red flagged), she is bringing a support person. It looks like she has attached the 
questionnaire. 
• Travel Arrangements 
o Over the weekend, I made travel arrangements to include fli ht itinerary and lodging 
accommodations for 
(also 
and her support person, 
Gloria Allred's executive assistant, Diane, was copied on all communication with their 
client. I had a phone call with Diane on Friday evening as 
and 
needed to stay through 
Friday (_was 
only able to come if they could stay through Friday - I think he may be working 
from NY this week and that may have been the reason why). Regardless, I explained that VSD could 
only pay for lodging Tuesday - Thursday and they would be responsible for reserving and paying for 
lodging accommodations for Thursday evening. Flying out of LAX was about the same amount on 
Friday as it was Thursday. An email was sent to 
(cc'd Diane) with their flight itinerary and 
hotel, specifically laying out when they are responsible for paying. Please note: 
s staying at 
different hotel 
since the _vas 
completely sold out. 
o 
sent an email yesterday saying she needs to change her flight to Friday because she has an 
event she must attend on Thursday. I'm completely unsure of she is referring to (personal or 
business event). As long as a Friday return ticket is comparable to the ticket she currently has= 
will probably approve; however, please run it by her first. If she does approve, an email will need to 
be sent to 
with similar language outlining what she is responsible for paying. 
sent an email asking how long she'd be required to be in NY. I forwarded to SA 
=case 
agent) an
 inquiring on if she needs to be interviewed. If she doesn't, can one 
of you check with Wand request her to stay an additional night (I think we currently have her
