S-1/A 
a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income from certain periods is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or 
business; or 
a foreign partnership if at any time during its tax year (a) one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who, in the 
aggregate, hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests of the partnership or (b) the foreign partnership is 
engaged in a U.S. trade or business; 
information reporting will apply unless the broker has documentary evidence in its files that the owner is a non-U.S. holder and 
certain other conditions are satisfied, or the beneficial owner otherwise establishes an exemption (and the broker has no knowledge 
or reason to know to the contrary). Backup withholding will apply if the sale is subject to information reporting and the broker has 
actual knowledge that you are a United States person. 
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a 
non-U.S. holder can be refunded or credited against the non-U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the 
required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.

Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 
Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, FATCA), 
a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% generally will be imposed on certain payments made to a "foreign financial institution" (as 
specifically defined under these rules) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. tax authorities to withhold on 
certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of 
such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are 
foreign entities with U.S. owners) or meets other exceptions. Under the legislation and administrative guidance, a U.S. federal 
withholding tax of 30% generally also will be imposed on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity 
provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying its direct and indirect U.S. owners or meets other exceptions. Foreign 
entities located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing these withholding and 
reporting requirements may be subject to different rules. Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. holder might be eligible for 
refunds or credits of such taxes. These withholding taxes would be imposed on dividends paid with respect to our common stock 
to, and, beginning on January 1, 2019, on gross proceeds from sales or other dispositions of our Class A common stock by foreign 
financial institutions or non-financial entities (including in their capacity as agents or custodians for beneficial owners of our Class A 
common stock) that fail to satisfy the above requirements. Prospective non-U.S. holders should consult with their tax advisors 
regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in our Class A common stock. 
Each prospective investor should consult its own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state and local 
and non-U.S. tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of our Class A common stock, including the 
consequences of any proposed change in applicable laws.
