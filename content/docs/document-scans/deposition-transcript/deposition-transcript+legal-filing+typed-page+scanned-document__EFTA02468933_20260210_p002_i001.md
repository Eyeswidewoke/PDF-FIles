a) understand 
b) transact in 
The real challenge with crypto currencies =nd digital assets like bitcoin, ethereum and ripple is multifaceted. 
=irstly, one has to try to figure out who is going to 'win'= Challenging, in its own right. Then how to buy it? Coinbase, a 
popular =rypto exchange, is high fee and has wide spread's, meaning =ransaction costs can be prohibitive. Hitherto, 
once you have decided =hich coin to buy and paid your spread, you then have to worry about =torage and making sure 
your coins aren't hacked and stolen Q=93 all of this has led to a fearful backdrop for investors. 
To solve these issues, Stoneridge have =reated an entity which provides easy access to the beta of digital 
=ssets/crypto currencies and is amongst, if not the first institutional =roduct ever to be built. It will be low fee, SEC 
registered and most =mportantly will secure the assets in cold storage meaning they can'= be hacked and/or stolen (this 
is done at US government security =tandards). The overall idea is to provide the same beta access to =rypto as they have 
to alternative lending, reinsurance and vol. 
This means you, as asset allocators, can =ake a straightforward decision: do you believe that digital assets are 
=he future? If so, you now the have access and the capability to buy a =und. 
The way Stoneridge =onstruct the beta is by making sure that each currency meets an =nvestment criteria. It has 
to have large liquidity (over USD$3bIn =arket cap), be tradable amongst NY state regulated entities and have a =horough 
code audit done by their data scientists. This rules out =CO's and other opaque offerings. In fact, there are only 4 =oins 
in the current index (out of many thousands of coins) but they =xpect more to come as more meet the criteria. It is then 
market cap =eighted. So, Stoneridge don't take any view on which they =elieve to be the right coin. Just what fits into 
their criteria. 
The fund is audited by EY — the only =rypto fund EY audit globally and administrated by Bank of New York. 
=toneridge are also working closely with the SEC as they go through the =egistration process to make sure they are 
comfortable with all facets =f the fund and ensure the fund is SEC registered — it will =ikely be the first fund of their type 
to achieve this status. =hey also work and have dialogues with the regulators which is very =mportant, and count Ben 
Lawsky, the ex-Superintendent of Financial =ervices for New York State and the creator of BitLicense, the first =egulatory 
scheme for digital currency businesses, as their Head of =egulatory Affairs. 
The macro argument is exceedingly compelling =ut often overshadowed by the daily price fluctuations. 
Currently, the =arket cap of crypto currencies is USD$210bIn. Gold is USD$8.2 trillion =nd real estate USD$220 trillion. 
Even if you feel that gap is going to =lose somewhat, then there is an argument one should hold crypto =urrencies 
moving forward. 
The other big issue is the liquidity trade. =nly 3 million people in the world own a crypto currency. Asset 
=llocators at endowments, pension funds, wealth managers are all =ntellectually interested but haven't had any 
capability to =urchase or allocate. Stoneridge, potentially, solve that issue and now =rovide people/institutions with a 
legitimate way to invest in the asset =lass. If even 1% of assets are allocated to digital currencies globally =he return 
could be extremely outsized. For some context, if central =anks allocate 5% of their holdings to digital assets then USD$1 
=rillion will flow into the sector. 
Of course, they all might go to zero. Just =ike gold, there is no real tangibility. You can't live in it =or example. 
But there is obviously huge interest in the sector as many =inancial firms invest in digital and blockchain technology. It's 
=orth noting that out of the USD$100mIn that Stoneridge has in their =igital asset fund (the fund has been in beta stage 
for 8 months and =nly now are they opening it up for external investors) their management =as USD$50mIn invested, so 
are clearly heavily invested themselves.
