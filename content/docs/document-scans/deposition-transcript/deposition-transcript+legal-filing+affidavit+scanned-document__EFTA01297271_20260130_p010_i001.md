04. (If the answer to Q2b. is "no']: While the Borrower itself is not an AIF or an AIFM acting on behalf of an AIF—is there 
any interconnectedness between the Borrower and/or the transaction to an AIF or an AIFM acting on behalf of en Alf? 
As you have stated in 02a. and Q2b. that the direct oaunterparty of the Bank is neither an AIF nor an AIFM, this question 
shall identify whether the lending or guarantee transaction could expose the Bank to the risk of an AIF for an AIFM acting on 
behalf of an AIF). In cases where the risk of default of an All Ira an AIFM acting on behalf of an AIF I is attributed for economic 
cases to the Borrower, this may constitute prohibited indirect lending and guarantee business. The lending or guarantee 
business could potentially be attributed to an AIF (or an AIFM acting on behalf of an All) if there is a contagion risk between 
the Borrower and an AIF (or an AIFM acting on behalf of an AIF). A contagion risk may exist if the All (or the AIFM acting on 
behalf of an All), e.g. as entity controlling the Borrower, has unlimited recourse to the assets of the Borrower, or if the AIF has 
assumed any liability in the event of default in respect of the liabilities of the Borrower under the loan or guarantee transaction. 
Please indicate YES or NO, and describe the basis for this conclusion in the Comments section as well as by checking 
the appropriate box in below table containing examples. 
YES (if the answer is "yes', please proceed to 05 in LEVEL 2 of the questionnaire) 
• NO (this transaction is not subject to the prohibition of landing or guarantee business under CBSA)
