nine major areas, including overall requirements, stock market, bond market, private equity, futures 
market, the competitiveness of the securities and futures sector, capital market openness, financial 
risks and market regulation. The policy is also referred as the "New National Nine Rules", in contrast to 
the earlier "National Nine Rules" issued in 2004. Under the nine broad guidelines, details on the 
directions and goals of reforms for thirty-three areas are specified, signaling the unprecedented 
resolution of Chinese government to push forward the comprehensive capital market reforms. It is 
government's aim to establish multi-layer capital markets, enlarge corporate and household investment 
channel, encourage efficient capital allocation as well as promote the economic 
restructuring. From macroeconomic perspective, we highlight the below reforms: 
Further opening up China's capital markets 
Following the recent announcement of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect Scheme on Apr 10, the Guideline 
again emphasizes on opening up the capital markets, with an aim to facilitate the cross-border investment 
and financing activities. Both inward and outward investment quotas under QFII and QDII programs will be 
increased. The shareholding limits for foreign capital in listcos will be relaxed. Domestic capital 
market will be steadily opened up for the direct investment of foreign individuals, and the domestic 
individuals investing in foreign capital market will be orderly pushed forward. Moreover, Xiao Gang, 
chairman of CSRC said this March that the potential QFII expansion is huge, and he mentioned that CSRC 
has been working on the QFII tax policy with other government agencies, as part of the effort to help 
facilitate QFII expansion this year. 
we believed that this proposal will help inject more liquidity into china A share market, as well as 
expedite China's progresses in capital account liberalization in a boarder sense, including a) further 
relaxing the foreign investment management like holding period and remittance; b) implementing and 
expanding the Stock Connect scheme (see our Apr 11 note "A leap in China's efforts to liberalize capital 
accounts"); c) establishing capital account convertibility in SHFTZ and developing a domestic RMB 
offshore market; d) permitting cross-border RMB remittances by individuals and broadening channels for 
offshore banks to borrow/lend RMB in domestic market. 
Promoting direct-financing 
To develop a multi-layer capital market with proper structure, complete function and effective regulation 
by 2020, the Guideline highlighted the development of direct financing, which includes three major areas 
of bond market, equity market and private equity. 
On bond market, the Guideline aimed to a) develop a scheme of local government bond issuance; 2) 
enrich bond products suitable for various investors; 3) develop bond types for SMEs; 4) connect different 
bond exchanges and 5) improve issuance procedure, rating mechanism as well as 6) promote asset 
securitization. To develop a multi-layered equity market and cultivate a healthy private equity market 
are other two major areas in promoting the direct-financing. 
In A share stock market, the approval-based stock issuance system will be replaced by a 
registration-based one, and such move will be accompanied by the new IPOs governing rules published by 
the Securities Association of china the same day of the Guideline. Regulators will crackdown insider 
trading, enhance information disclosure, improve delisting regime, and support pension funds investments 
into capital markets by preferential tax policies. 
The state council also said it will foster the market for private equity funds and venture capital 
funds. Going forward, the placement of private equity won't be subjected to administrative approval and 
funds of private equity and venture capital will be encouraged to support SMEs and newly-emerging 
industries. 
we believe that such reforms will substantially help to improve financial stability and capital 
allocation in China. According to CSRC, 42.3% of financing in China belonged to the direct-financing 
category by end of 2012, lower than that of developed economies like the US (87.2%), japan (74.4%), 
Germany (69.2%) and emerging markets like India (66.7%) and Indonesia (66.3%). As a result, risks are 
highly concentrated in banking system. And financing is expensive and hard to access for small borrowers. 
we expect that the reforms of promoting direct-financing will help enrich the investment channels for 
individuals and corporate, disperse risk in financial system, meet financing needs of SMEs and lower the 
funding cost for them. 
Under such endeavor, China capital markets will be much more diverse, structured and transparent in the 
future, and will a) mobilize massive private savings; b) encourage inward portfolio flows; and c) lift 
market sentiment and valuation.
