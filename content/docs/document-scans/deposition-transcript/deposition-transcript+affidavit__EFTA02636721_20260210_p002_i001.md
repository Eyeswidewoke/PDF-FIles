The most important thing to me is a strategy t=at eliminates (or dramatically minimizes) a criminal case. 
That is a g=me changer. You cannot live your whole life in fear of some crook fil=ng a false criminal complaint on 
fabricated 20 year old facts; but you need=a solid plan on how to deal with such a development when, as now, it arises= 
If AD meets with the guy h= must be armed for bear in terms of showing the guy this is a completely 
fa=ricated claim, on the chance the guy has been duped. If the guy is a c=ook then he is not going away. 
If you knew you could show some facts claimed are impossible then lever=ge shifts dramatically (and I 
am not sure I would disclose that in specific=terms at this point). By this I mean not in NY in September 2001, house 
did=not look then as described, not in NY for all the regular meetings she clai=s, etc.

Rule 3.4(e) of the NY Rules of Professional Conduct prohi=its a lawyer from threatening

However, under the disciplinary rules th=t were the predecessor to these and which in

The real danger you face is the filing of rare charges in NY in this environment and with 
all the bad press especially r=cently. He knows that and he knows there is no statute of limitations= 
What is your theory in where he/she got the detai=s (from the FL lawyer?)? How did 
she come to the FL lawyer originally= Why didn't she do something then? 
Are his details accurate in the layout from 2001? Were you in NY alll t=e time then? 
How about specifically in September 2001? 
=/div> 
Might be worth putting a good investigator on this quickly. =1 don't want to undercut 
any legal advice you might be getting. 
Would a charge here violate any outstanding obligation= in FL? Are you still on paper 
there? It would be bizarre if an= problem there from alleged 2001 conduct.
