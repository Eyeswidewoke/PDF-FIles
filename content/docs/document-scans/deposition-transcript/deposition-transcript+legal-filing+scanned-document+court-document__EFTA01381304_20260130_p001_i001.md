Table of Contra' 
our food safety and quality program includes strict guidelines for incoming ingredients, batching, processing, packaging and finished goods. As 
pan of our focus on safety and quality, we have implemented FDA-approved batch and lot traceability controls across our manufacturing network, 
including at our Heartland facility. where such controls have been implemented into our SAP ERP system. These controls allow us to track and tic 
discreet. inbound raw material components through the manufacturing process to the ultimate finishal product, allowing us to maintain and control 
all finished product lot details and quickly access process manufacturing details. However. despite our strict quality controls, it is possible that there 
may be from time to time, as there has been in the past, issues or concerns with respect to our products. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our 
Business and Industry—We may face issues with respect to raw materials and other supplies. including increased costs, disruptions of supply. 
shortages, contaminations, adulterations or mislabeling" and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—If our products are 
alleged to cause injury or illness or fail to comply with governmental regulations, we may nod to recall our products and may experience product 
liability claims." We do not produce any of our products in Asia. where the oversight of the ingredient sourcing/purchasing and manufacturing can 
be difficult to manage. Many of our competitors' products. including some Wholesome Natural products. are produced in Asia. 
Our food safety and quality program also requires that finished goods arc tested to ensure proper nutrition and the absence of microbial 
contaminants such as salmonella. These tests are performed at independent third-party and our internal laboratories. We do not release our products 
to customers without first receiving test results from these independent third-party or internal laboratories. 
Strong Position at Our Retailers and Distribution Partners 
As a leader in advertising and brand-building in the pet food category•, we continue to drive traffic to brick-and-mortar stores and 
eCommerce retailers where BLUE is sold. In addition to the regular traffic we help generate, we believe our products arc attractive to retailers 
given the strong gross margins they deliver to retailers. We work with our retail partner; to customize product assortment, starting with the highest 
sales velocity items that fit their customer base in order to optimize our retail partners' economics. With our broad product portfolio, we see an 
opportunity to continue to increase our shelf space. especially outside of national pet superstores. These dynamics have made us a strong partner to 
our retailers, as we continue to increase the breadth and depth of ow distribution. 
Sales through the eCommerce channel represented approximately 4% of our U.S. retail sales in 2014 compared to approximately 2% of 
U.S. pet food sales overall. We intend to strengthen ow partnerships with ow brick-and-mortar retail partners on their eCommerce and internet 
marketing programs, as well as with online-only cCommcrce retailers to continue to grow in this rapidly developing channel. As of mid-2014, we 
switched larger eCommerce accounts from distributors to direct Blue Buffalo accounts in order to strengthen and better manage our go-to-market 
approach in this channel. As the pet food brand with the highest online search volume in the United States and a higher sham among younger 
consumers who typically have a higher affinity for online shopping, we believe BLUE is well-positioned for growth in the °Commerce channel. 
We believe we have a differentiated, strategic and highly analytical approach to establishing and maintaining our relationship with our 
retail partners. We strive to understand their business needs and priorities and work with them to identify market opportunities and trends and 
develop customized solutions to efficiently execute an effective sales strategy. We have access to the consumer sell-through data of our products at 
a SKU-by-store level of our larger direct accounts and have visibility into their inventories, and we work closely with our retail partners to manage 
their inventories to optimize working capital and minimize out-of-stocks. We also have arms to our distributors' sales to their retail accounts as 
well as visibility into consumer sell-through for select retail accounts. 
Saks and Dishibution 
We sell our products primarily in the United States and Canada. The vast majority of our sales are in the United States. In 2014, only 3% 
of our net sales were outside of the United States.
