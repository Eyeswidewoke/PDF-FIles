Prince Andrew's friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, some underage girls and a very disturbing story I the ... Page 9 of 17 
"We had a picture taken. Virginia, another girl there, sat on a chair and had the puppet on her lap. Andrew sat 
-on another chair, I sat on his lap — and he put his hand on my breast. Ghislaine put the puppet's hand on 
Virginia's breast, then Ar-i
t his hand on mine. It was a great joke. Everybody laughed. Ghislaine made a 
lot of sexual jokes," says 
"She had a very dirty sense of humour. 
"There were pictures of her and Jeffrey and the Pope, and her and Jeffrey and Castro, and her and Jeffrey and 
Clinton." 
If the groping incident was shrugged off as a joke, it was in New York that 
got the first indications of 
something more seriously amiss.
"While I was in New York, Jeffrey asked me to do the nipple thing. He asked me to touch his nipples during the 
massage. I was shocked. I said, 'I am not doing this. I'm done.' And I walked out of the room. He couldn't 
believe I refused. No one else had ever done that." 
Despite her refusal, she was invited to spend time on Epstein's private island in the British Virgin Islands where, 
she was warned by Jeffrey, that there would be "sex stuff" going on. 
Says 
"I thought I was going to the island to do massage. I thought I would probably get paid. I was 
doing one or two a day, mostly for him, but sometimes for Ghislaine. She wasn't very picky, but he [Epstein] 
kept dictating what he wanted. She would be naked under a towel during the massage. There was no suggestion 
from her of anything untoward during the massages." 
The trip seemed like paradise to M. 
She says: "The island was incredible, with four wheelers to drive 
around in and this beautiful living room area with a great projector TV screen. 
"We were all watching movies together at night but not porn — Jeffrey isn't into that. It felt like a fairy tale and 
they were great fun to be around. 
"I do remember him and her jumping off the dock naked, swimming. 
"I thought it was normal for them, they were very free people. I would not do it with people around, but it was 
normal for them." 
During the break, 
got an idea of the kind of circles Epstein usually moved in. 
"I would be massaging him and he'd be on the phone and then hang up and say, 'oh, that was Cate Blanchett,' or 
'I was on a plane with Clinton.' Clinton is definitely a friend of his. 
"He'd say, 'I was hanging out with Leo diCaprio and Bruce Willis'." 
Then she adds: At
e major TV personality who said, 'What's the deal with the girls going out to find other 
girls?" He told 
that he had heard that girls were being paid $200 a time to introduce their teenage 
friends to Epstein. 
But at the time, whether through innocence or naivety, 
didn't understand. Only when the police came 
asking questions last year did it dawn on her what the TV star might have meant. Police documents reveal that 
Epstein was investigated for almost a year after a 2005 complaint that a 14-year-old girl had partially stripped 
for Epstein and given him a massage and other services in exchange for $300. 
S
imber of young women have claimed the financier interfered with them sexually. One young woman, 
who unwisely described herself as "like a Heidi Fleiss" (the notorious Hollywood madam) admitted 
helping find teenage girls for Epstein.
