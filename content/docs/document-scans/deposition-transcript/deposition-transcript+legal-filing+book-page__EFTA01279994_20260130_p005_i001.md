2. 
Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as othenvise described in this Section 2, all 
payments accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: 
(a) interest due under the Note; (b) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. 
Such payments shall be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due. Any 
remaining amounts shall be applied first to late charges, second to any other amounts due under this 
Security Instrument, and then to reduce the principal balance of the Note. 
If Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a 
sufficient amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment 
and the late charge. If more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any 
payment received from Borrower to the repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent 
that, each payment can be paid in full. To the extent that any excess exists after the payment is 
applied to the full payment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any 
late charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall be applied first to any prepayment charges and then as 
described in the Note. 
Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under 
the Note shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments. 
3. 
Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due 
under the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the "Funds") to provide for payment of 
amounts due for: (a) taxes and assessments and other items which can attain priority over this 
Security Instrument as a lien or encumbrance on the Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground 
rents on the Property, if any; (c) premiums for any and all insurance required by Lender under 
Section 5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance premiums, if any, or any sums payable by Borrower to 
Lender in lieu of the payment of Mortgage Insurance premiums in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 10. These items are called "Escrow Items." At origination or at any time during the term of 
the Loan, Lender may require that Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be 
escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall 
promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower shall pay 
Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower's obligation to pay the Funds for 
any or all Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower's obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or 
all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, 
Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for 
which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and. if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender 
receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower' s 
obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to be a 
covenant and agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase "covenant and 
agreement" is used in Section 9. If Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a 
waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights 
under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay 
to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time 
by a notice given in accordance with Section 15 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to 
Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.
