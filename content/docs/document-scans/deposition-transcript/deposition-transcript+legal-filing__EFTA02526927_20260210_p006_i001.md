Yo= report a visit by Harry and Max with an idea about using assets. l&=39;II respond to that in my other letter. 
I did have a private visit=with Max in my MIT office in which he explained that I'd have to sharp=y reduce my past 
lifestyle, sell the boat and other such assets, because l= the way my estate had been arranged. That was the first I'd 
hea=d of any of this. At that point I began to look into what was going =n and found what I've described. 
You say that "as far as we know, no financial plann=ng has occurred, despite the passage of a year and a half 
since Max and Ha=ry understood we all agreed it needed to be done." 
<=r> 
That's the first I've heard that Max an= Harry have been my supervisors. I had thought that Max was my lawye= 
and that Harry was my son. In fact, financial planning has occurred= the first serious planning since Eric, but it never 
occurred to me that l=was supposed to be under the control of Max and Harry. 
You're right that I changed my rel=tions with Anthony, as part of our financial planning. Again, it did=not occur 
to me that this was anyone's business but mine. You ca= have your beliefs about the facts, but I have the facts available 
and fee= I have the right to make such decisions without supervision, just as you =1. 
You are quite right that I can r=pay the loan to the marital trust, even though the profits from sale of th= 
apartment are considerably less than your sources told you. I won&t1=93 comment further about this, but you might 
want to think about it.<=div> 
As for my lifestyle, for your informatio= it is considerably reduced from what it used to be, though I don't 
unrerstand why that is your business, any more than I inquire into your lifes=yles or seek to supervise them. 
The "sudden and sustained increase in spending" is fully expl=ined by the malpractice I have once again 
reviewed to you. That'= why the IRA was depleted. Now that I have ended these practices. 
Your phrase &qu=t;an independent Trustee, such as Max," is quite remarkable in the li=ht of what I have told 
you, not least the legalistic chicanery about the M=rital Trust. He's your lawyer, working for your benefit, which i= what 
a lawyer is supposed to do I suppose. That explains the record I hav= described at length, repeatedly. But I have every 
right to select a= independent and qualified Trustee, just as I selected the Trustees up unt=l now. 
I can only repeat what I said befor=. We surely should be concerned about one another. I've of=en been 
concerned about your decisions and choices, and felt that they wer= questionable or misguided. It never occurred to me 
that I should inquire =nto the details of your financial situation or your lifestyles or to super=ise what you do. Rather, I 
just supported it, whatever my misgivings= financially and in other ways. Same with Mommoy when she was alive,=and 
contrary what you seem to believe (along with Max), we were a couple, =aking decisions jointly, not deciding separately 
how to allocate funds und=r her or my separate control. 
I do =ope we can end this quickly, and pick up our lives without this blight.
