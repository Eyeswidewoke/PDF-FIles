Update of the Last 10 Years 
During the last 5 years of our fight with the government, because of Landmar.'s high quality 
environmental record, Landmark was invited by the Europe=n Union to develop the last great sand dune on the west 
coast of Ireland. We developed, on a fee basis, the Doonbeg Go=f Club, which when it was opened, was rated by Golf 
Digest as th= best new course in the world. Because of the time spe=t in Ireland, we were approached to do a 
development in the south of Sp=in, where we did Arcos Gardens, chosen by some as the best new course bui=t that year 
in the world and chosen by most to be the best new course i= Spain in many years. We also developed, on a fee and=20 
carried ownership interest basis, Lake Presidential in Maryland, 14 m=Ies due east of the U.S. capital, and moved our 
corporate headquarters to=20 Maryland. 
Although it was agreed that Landmark had contributed $131 million net value to the bank in 1982, and 
that the government, without cause= violated their contract, Landmark received only $21 million from the =ourt of 
Claims. By the time it paid its lawyers, court costs, and its debt of honor to directors, etc., it had approximately=$4 
million net remaining. In 2004 we purchased South Pad=e Island, our joint venture with the Lloyd Bentsen family in 
South Texa=, from the fund run by Lewie Ranieri, and on a friendly basis, separate= our relationship with Lewie. In 2006 
we invested $4 milli=n to purchase one-third of Apes Hill Club, Barbados. 
South Padre Island proved a success in that we sold approximately 150 houses in 2005, 200 in 2006, 170 
in 2007, and in ea=h of these years had cash flow of $3 million to $5 million net to the parent. We have developed 
approximately half of the=20 2,000 acres, have 1,000 homes built, and approximately 1,200 left to =e built. After Lloyd 
Bentsen's death, we bought from =is estate, at a very attractive price, his interest, and it is now owned=100% by 
Landmark. 
South Padre Island Development is on the right side of history in that it o=fers good value, in warm 
weather. on the water for middle-class pre-retire=ent, retirement buyers, however, with the housing crisis we only sold 
21 h=uses in 2008 and are doing only slightly better than that in 2009.=A0 Therefore, the cash flow is not coming from 
South Padre to Landmark, but cash is going from Landmark to South Padre. Recently there was some sign of optimism, 
but in the short run= this may be a false spring. In the long run, I am confident that offering homes in a good golf course 
community from $135,000 up will be in the heart of the baby boomers retirement plan. 
Apes Hill Club is 470 acres that overlooks both the west coast of the Cari=bean and the east cost of the 
Atlantic. It has been the mo=t successful and highest quality development I have ever been associate= with. While at 
the present time, with the pound low=20 against the dollar and the financial crisis in England and Ireland at=its zenith,
