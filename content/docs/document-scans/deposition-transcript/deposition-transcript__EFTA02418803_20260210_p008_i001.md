suggestive but matter-of-fact. You're making hooker money, right? So, if it walks like a duck and 
talks like a duck 
On her blog, SexDrugsandBottle Service.tumblr.com Kim elucidates the difference between bottle 
hooking and real hooking: Bottle Hookering I've made upwards of $1,500 in a night, and I don't 
have to sleep with any of my clients.' Though I do have to flirt with them, booty dance with 
them, call them, hang out with them, occasionally procure girls and party favors' for them, all 
while wearing teeny tiny outfits. So I suppose it's a form of social prostitution. Her counterpart, 
a college call girl whose blog Kim reads in her downtime, makes significantly less. Her prices are 
$100 for a handy, $150 for a BJ, $200 for doin' it, she writes. Mine are $400 for a bottle of Grey 
Goose, $300 for Veuve, $700 for Cristal. 
Kim became a bottle girl after she graduated from a very good college on the East Coast. I figured: I'm 
cute, I'm young, I can make a shitload of money, so, she says, holding up two middle fingers, 
fuck it! She had previously worked as a restaurant waitress, and she wasn't naive about the 
difference between that job and this one. If you say you're a bottle waitress, it's better than 
saying you're a stripper. But it's the same thing as being a stripper, she says. What she means 
by stripper is someone who is a touchable commodity. There is never money exchanged, but 
there are gifts the following week. Pairs of Louboutins, Louis Vuitton bags, trips. It's not unusual 
for a bottle waitress to take two days off and fly to Vegas with a client. She won't get fired for 
that, so long as when they return, the client will spend large at the club. 
lust last week at Haze in Las Vegas, a whale left a $30,000 tip on top of the automatic 20 percent 
gratuity of his $182,000 bill. A girl can make up to $100,000 a year, working just three nights a 
week. 
But it's not just about the money, says Steve Lewis. For most of them, it's the thrill of calling their friends 
back home. Girls are getting into the hottest clubs in town, they are meeting celebrities. They 
call their girlfriends back home, Oh my God! I was hanging out with So-and-so! He was so nice!' 
At one point, Kim says, every single girl I knew was sleeping with a celebrity. It's the access. Some of the 
girls definitely think, He's going to fly me to California and make me his wife!' But then most of 
them are just like, Guess who I just did in the bathroom?' 
Next: How the job the job eventually lost its glow for Kim. 
But most of the men Kim would never be involved with in the real world. She had one client, a fat dude 
from Long Island, whose money and status came from being the close relative of a celebrity. He 
thought I was his girlfriend, it was so gross. It was pathetic. She never touched him, like that. At 
dinner, she would choose the wineBarolo, if we needed something full-bodiedand that was as 
far as it went. There was a courtesan, geisha feel to it, says Kim. But he was valuable to her. She 
would have him pick her up from staff meetings, roll up in his car so she could show off her 
catch. The bigger the whale you reel, the better a bottle girl you are. The more you siphon from 
the whales, the more you mean to the club. 
For Kim, the job eventually lost its glow. One night, she was taken off her shift as punishment for not 
selling enough bottles. The girls are expected to be sociable on their nights off, so she came to 
the club anyway as a patron with a big client in tow. When his friends left, the client began to 
grope her. They were kissing and she hated every second and she was being mashed into the 
couch and when she looked up at one point she saw her manager, watching them. Smiling like 
he'd forgiven her, he said, I'm going to leave you kids alone.
