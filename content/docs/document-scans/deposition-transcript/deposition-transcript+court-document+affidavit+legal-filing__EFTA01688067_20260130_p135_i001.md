federal and state estate, inheritance, succession, and similar taxes (including any federal or state 
generation-skipping transfer tax) imposed upon my probate estate or by reason of my death in 
respect to all assets which pass under this Will or the Trust Agreement. Subject to Paragraph B(2)

reimbursement) from any recipient of any Apportionment Assets for any or all of such taxes 
allocable to such assets.

My Executor has discretion to direct the 
Trustee of the Trust Agreement to pay all or any portion of the taxes which my Executor is directed

C. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Will, a 
bequest or devise to an individual who does not survive me shall lapse notwithstanding any law to 
the contrary.
