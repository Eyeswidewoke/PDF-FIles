account given by Ms Ny it would have been a reasonable reaction to apply for an EAW. "Certainly, I would have 
done the same myself'. 
It is a decision for the Swedish court whether a defendant is held in custody and if so whether it should be 
incommunicado. The failure to hold public hearings has not led to appeals to the court of appeal or to 
Strasbourg, as far as he can remember. Nevertheless it has caused debate. 
He was then asked about extradition from Sweden to the United States. He is not an expert on what happens 
but had brought a Guide and had considered the specialty principle. His reading was that normally there could 
not be a further surrender to a country outside the European Union but there arc exceptions. It would be
"completely impossible to extradite Mr Assange to the USA without a media storm". It is quite right to say that 
he would not be extradited to the USA. 
Overall I was left with the impression of a sincere witness doing his best to help the court. He relied on Mr 
Hurtig for his information as to the attempts made to interview Mr Assange. His strongest criticism was based 
on the information that no attempt had been made to interview the suspect while he was still in Sweden. 
However, even on Ms Ny's account he was critical of the decision not to arrange an interview in the UK. 
Mr Bjorn Hurtig gave evidence from before lunch until the end of the day. Again I need not set out his evidence 
in full. He is an experienced Swedish criminal trial lawyer and the defence counsel for Mr Julian Assange in 
relation to the criminal investigation against him in Sweden. 
His proof of evidence states that the manner in which Ms Ny has handled the case thus far is not in compliance 
with the concept of a fair trial. Any trial will be behind closed doors. The trial will be heard by a judge and three 
lay judges. The lay judges arc appointed by political parties. There is significant prejudice because of trial by 
media. 
His main complaint is levelled at the investigation conducted by Marianne Ny. "It is well known, and is in fact 
stated in the Prosecution Manual and the received wisdom of prosecutors, that rape cases must be investigated 
quickly, among other things because the defendant is almost always put into custody in this kind of case. 
Sensibly, a new statement was taken from the rape complainant at Ms Ny's direction on 2nd September. 
However, astonishingly she made no effort to interview him on the rape charge to get his side of the story". Mr 
Hurtig gives a detailed account in his proof about his involvement in the case and the attempts he made to 
persuade the prosecutor to question Mr Assangc as soon as possible. The lawyer was left with the impression 
that the rape case may be closed "without even bothering to interview him. On 27th September 2010, Mr 
Assange left Sweden". While the defendant was abroad the defence offered him for interview in the week of 11th 
October, but the prosecutor vetoed the suggestion because "it was too far ahead". "I found it astonishing that 
Ms Ny, having allowed five weeks to elapse before she sought an interview with Mr Assangc should now decide 
that it would be too late to hear his story if a further week elapsed". He then describes the fairly continuous
