in your Office's possession that was helpful the victims' CVRA case. We were informed that 
your Office will be taking the position in Court that it can and will withhold from the victims 
such information, apparently on the theory that victims lack due process or other "discovery" 
rights under the CVRA. 
We believe that the position that your Office can suppress relevant evidence is legally 
unfounded for four reasons and, in any event, is unsound policy at odds with promises that the 
Attorney General has made to crime victims and to the public. With regard to the legal 
problems in this position, first, the CVRA promises victims of crime that they will be "treated 
with fairness." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8). The clear intent of Congress in passing this provision was 
to provide a substantive "due process" right to crime victims. As one of the CVRA's co-sponsors 
(Seriator Kyl) explained, "The broad rights articulated in this section are meant to be rights 
themselves and are not intended to just be aspirational. One of these rights is the right to be 
treated with fairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process. Too often victims 
of crime experience a secondary victimization at the hands of the criminal justice system. This 
provision is intended to direct Government agencies and employees, whether they are in 
executive or judiciary branches, to treat victims of crime with the respect they deserve." 150 
CONG. REc. 54269 (Apr. 22, 2004) (emphasis added). 
Because the CVRA extends a "due process" right to crime victims like Jane Doe #1 and 
Jane Doe #2, victims have a right to fair access to evidence to prove their case. The very 
foundation of the Brady obligation is due process: "[T]he suppression by the prosecution of 
evidence favorable to an accused . .. violates due process where the evidence is material either 
to guilt or to punishment." Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). It would similarly 
violate due process for the prosecution to suppress evidence favorable to a crime victim where 
the evidence is material either to proving a CVRA violation or to the remedy for a violation. 
Second, entirely apart from whether the victims have a right to obtain such information, 
your Office has an affirmative obligation to disclose it to victims. The CVRA directly commands 
that "[o]fficers and employees of the Department of Justice and other departments and 
agencies of the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime 
shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights 
described in [the CVRA)." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (emphasis added).1 It is simply impossible for 
As you can see from this language, the CVRA applies not only to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida but also to the relevant office of the FBI. We are "cc'ing" a copy of this letter 
to the FBI so that they can be informed of our view that they should provide assistance to the victims in 
this matter as well, rather than join your Office in any effort to withhold evidence. We understand that 
your Office represents the FBI on these issues, and are happy to continue our discussions with you 
regarding the FBI obligations in this area. At the appropriate time, however, if we are unable to reach 
agreement, we would like to have this discussion with a representative of the FBI to see whether they 
are in accord with your position. It is our understanding that the appropriate person would be the 
"special agent-in-charge of the division having primary responsibility for conducting the investigation."
