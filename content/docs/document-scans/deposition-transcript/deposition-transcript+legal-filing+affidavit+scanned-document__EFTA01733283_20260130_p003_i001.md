charged with the crimes of ISIS and its ilk, becau=e the world is in a coma, and it may not wake up from it anytime soon. 
=e must learn our lessons and wait." 
[Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, Nov. 24, 2015] 
The following is a longer=excerpt of the op-ed by Hafez Al-Barghouti, regular columnist and former e=itor for Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida: 
"Do not call out There is n= god but Allah' and 'Allah is great' because this has become a game of blo=d. Anyone who 
shouts and roars when blessing a child for drawing a knife, =r a student for carrying scissors, should see them as his own 
children. Wi=l he agree to throw his offspring into the thick of battle?Some factions..= will utter statements, and play 
songs calling for more acts of this kind =but are actually trading in the blood of others, setting themselves as tho=e 
entrusted with our blood, when not even a single drop of their blood spi=ls... 
It is our duty to prevent ou= sons and daughters... from carrying out futile acts, which the enemy in h=s media and 
diplomacy has begun to link to the acts of the terror organiza=ions in Paris and elsewhere, in order to strip us of our 
humanity, and pla= the role of the human. This is while, there is no one else in the world, =xcept for him (the enemy], 
who boasts about occupying someone else's land =nd oppressing its owners. Moreover, we should note that after the 
event= of September [9, 20111 in New York, [then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon copied the term 'terror' used to 
refe= to those attacks, to our national struggle (i.e., terror campaign - In=ifada). I warned about this at the time, and 
called to keep a low pro=ile until the New York turmoil had passed, but the concept of 'Palestinian=terror' later spread, 
instead of [the general term) 'terror.' Now, after the Paris attacks, we must kee= a low profile so that we are not charged 
with the crimes of ISIS and =ts ilk, because the world is in a coma, and it may not wake up from it any=ime soon. We 
must learn our lessons and wait. It is preferab=e that our enemy kill us, than for us to encourage our young people to 
rea=h such a pointless end, because the value of the dead is determined by the=manner of death and its outcomes. 
Death itself is not a requirement, so do=not praise death, so that our deaths will not be in vain. Our duty is to e=ucate 
the younger generation, and explain to it about the love of life, th= seeking of knowledge, and endeavors. As for the 
struggle, it has its own =erms and men [to run it]."

Paris attacks 2015 </=>- On Nov. 13, 2015, seven terrorist attacks were ca=ried out simultaneously in Paris, France, in 
which it is estimated that 12= people were murdered. An additional 352 people were wounded, 99 of them i= serious 
condition. The most massive attack took place at the Bataclam the=ter during a rock concert, where 87 people were 
murdered. On Nov. 14, 2015=ISIS claimed responsibility for these attacks.
