Garten, the Trump campaign, Epstein, or others associated with Defendants. 
While it remains possible that this version of the case may 
be dismissed like the California filing, the New York version has already 
survived twice as long, with less pushback from Trump 
representatives, and with some hints of more serious media attention (as 
well as satiric exposure on Redacted Tonight June 24). 
Trump rape case has strange context, proving nothing, but 
The first, fundamental question about this case is whether it's credible, 
and the metaphorical jury is still out on that. But we're looking at 
Trump rape allegations in the aftermath of the Bill Cosby multi-scandal, 
which serves as a caution for anyone wanting to rush to judgment. 
And with Trump, there's already a context in in sharp contrast with what we 
thought about Cosby before we knew about Cosby. 
Trump's co-defendant, billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, is a convicted sex 
offender who has served jail time, after pleading guilty to reduced 
charges. Yes, that's guilt-by-association, but there's little doubt that 
their association was lengthy and cordial. According to the Mirror.com: 
Trump's co-accused, Epstein, who was once a close friend of the Duke of 
York, pleaded guilty to two [Florida] state charges of soliciting a 
minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. He served 13 months 
after being sentenced in 2008. 
Investigators suspected the former New York financier of abusing 34 underage 
girls but lawyers failed to charge him or any of his "coconspirators" 
and instead offered him a secret plea bargain. 
Epstein has dubiously defended himself by telling the N.Y. Post in 2011: 
"I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 'offender.' It's the difference 
between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.... The crime that was 
supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York." 
The court has ruled that Epstein is a Level 3 offender, the highest level, 
who is a "high risk" to repeat his offense and "a threat to public 
safety." Before his plea bargain, Epstein faced 10 years in prison on 
charges of statutory rape. He served 13 months. Now the Daily Beast 
is arguing (June 30) that "billionaire sicko Jeffrey Epstein" is a political 
time bomb "who could bring down Donald Trump and Hillary 
Clinton." 
Trump has recently downplayed and minimized his relationship with Epstein, 
who once taught rich teenagers at the posh Dalton School in 
New York. A New York Magazine profile of Epstein in 2014 presented a 
different perspective: 
Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched 
alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. 
And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. "I've 
known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy," Trump booms from a 
speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes 
beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the
