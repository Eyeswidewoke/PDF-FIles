Lesley, 
I spoke with Jeff about Craig, we both think he could potentially be a great guy, I shared 
a nice conversation with Jeff. He said you are kind of scheduling everything, so in my 
opinion and haven't spoken to Jeff about this is that you schedule Craig to come down 3 
days before Jeff gets there and have Jeff give him 3-5 items to look into and nothing 
more. Have him access the situation for those 2-3 days and then stay 1 or 2 days with 
Jeff being there and let's see what he comes up with regarding those items on the hit list. 
I also thought regarding the negotiation process, as I told Jeff the guys I'm looking at are 
$180-200k, the guys at $150K are the fellows that don't last, are not qualified. I think this 
fellow is in the correct salary range of $180-200K, which is what he's looking for. Think 
set him up so the one week he is paid at a prorated rate of $180k — if after 5 days we 
spoke about above, Jeff feels like it's a go then you do a 90 day trial period at $180K, 
after 90 days, which I will help you negotiate an employment contract with him as you 
want 6 month breakaway + health insurance etc, which isn't not hard but I'm sure some 
dumb lawyer will take a look at it. So take 30 days or so in the meantime Jeff has the 90 
day option so he can walk away or Jeff doesn't feel bad terminating him as that's happen 
and if 90 days, Craig picks up then he moves up to $200K + benefits and we will have to 
work out 20-25% bonus plan of some sort if he exceeds Jeffs expectations. This can be 
a little difficult but that's the area these guys play in. I also didn't have chance to tell Jeff, 
but he really knows the Caribbean operation — reverse osmosis, different types of grass, 
gray water watering- my opinion could be beneficial as long as Jeff gets along with him 
and we see how his organization and follow up skills are, which is probably the most 
important factor. If you are in agreement, I'd get a hold of him and asap tell him what 
date he'll be in the Caribbean as the fellow is out looking for job. Why don't you speak 
with Jeff and let me know if I can help.
