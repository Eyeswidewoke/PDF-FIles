proof of burn (re: bitcoin&anonymity) 
Jeffrey, 
not sure if you're still interested in this but.. to answer in a more =xplanatory way the question of how to remove 
anonymity from bitcoin, =ere it is: 
The bitcoin network has a couple of things that are particularly =mportant for any crypto currency, the first one is that 
the network is =ig enough to prevent double-spending kind of attacks and the second one is that there's no way (I mean 
there is, but it's =ci-fi) to generate the private key for a random bitcoin identify/public =ey that is not yours. 
A number of annoying things about bitcoin are: 
1) It's deflationary, not just because the amount of coins is finite but =lso because people lose wallets/keys so potentially 
a lot of the mined =oins will never see the light of the day 
2) You can create as many wallets/keys as you want, in theory this =flows you to keep separate identities.. in practice 
this is not =ntirely true 
3) A little known fact is that you can mess with the blockchain/ledger =uite a lot, for instance somebody forced specific 
values into the =edger. For instance, these values could be virus signature, so antiviruses would quarantine/delete the 
blockchain from people =omputers. Not only that, but people have been storing all sort of stuff =nto the blockchain and 
it's permanent you cannot undo it. 
See: http://pastebin.com/ct2WHUKS and =ttp://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html 
ok so here's what you do if you want to fix (1) and (2), I don't have a =ood solution for (3) unless you change the power 
forces inside the =etwork (eg: unless you allow a centralized unit to 'clean' the =lockchain) 
You create another crypto/alt currency that is inflationary so it mimics =eal money better, then you tell people: 
"everyone who has Bitcoins can =et them exchanged for this other currency". 
The way this would work is that you actually require people to sign up =or a *single• identify/key/wallet linked to their 
real identity and =hen you do something called 'proof of burn', which in practice means =hat you tell people that to 
prove they 'exchanged' their bitcoins they need =o send them to a non-existent address (remember that it's impossible 
to =enerate the private key of a random bitcoin address/public key, so nobody can ever claim those coins and they are 
lost forever). 
On the top of that, since the bitcoin network is flexible you can use =hat blockchain to record the transactions of your 
own currency without =ny major issues (there are some technicalities involved but nothing =uch). 
This brings to the last and probably hardest point which is: Why people =ould do it? 
So some people do it already to get on board new currencies, so it's =ostly a speculation/ideology/belief. But if say 
you're a government, =ou can sweeten the deal saying something like "your holdings in =itcoins will not be taxed if 
moved to this other currency". 
If you're not a govt then things are more complicated, but well..
