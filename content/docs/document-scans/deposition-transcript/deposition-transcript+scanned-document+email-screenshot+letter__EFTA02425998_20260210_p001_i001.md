Robin Hood/Cannes 
Title: Robin Hood/Cannes 
#1. I would love to go to Robin Hood and can sit at any table. Hopefully I might know some of the people at that 
table....but if this is a hassle, I can call Liz Smith and easily buy a ticket for the Literacy Partners at Lincoln 
Center... 
#2. IFP (Independent Filmmakers Project) Spring Gala at Diane von Furstenberg's honoring her daughter Tatiana....was a 
hugh success. Had cocktails and film clip presentation on second floor of her studio and then a dinner for 180 downstairs 
in her hugh white photo gallery with long tables covered with hot chartreuse cloths and piles of bright Italian food down 
the center. It was fabulous. Very large photos of movie and rock stars lined the walls. Oliver Stone, DvF, Uma, Patty 
Clarkson, Blythe Danner and son Jake, Joel Schumacher, Mamie Gummer (Meryl Streep's daughter)...and tons of young 
terrific hip filmmakers (and models, artists, photographers, fashion designers) that we cultivate came. All the kids had a 
ball and then walked a block to the Boom Boom Room till 2:00am. Got tons of press. Jaqui Safra gave us $I0,000 worth 
of wine from his own Napa Valley vineyard...kids drinking $100 bottles of wine...and Michael Saylor giving 525,000 for 
food and the opportunity to get his name on invite and meet a hip group. Saylor is a complete creep. He has no 
personality. Sort of like a zombie on a drug. We had smart directors sitting next to him and his idiot gorgeous date and 
could not get any conversation out of him except "I have a yacht I am taking to Cannes". 
I walked him around and he was so weird that even I ran away from him. There is an obvious personal disconnect and I 
don't think I can just take his money and deliver a better life because he has no feel for social behavior. Diane was over the 
moon we did this great event for her daughter because her son was honored the next night at the Whitney Museum party a 
block south of her store/building under a tent on the land where they will build a new downtown museum. That party was 
also a bit weird because cultural institutions like the Whitney need so much money that people like Susan Hess with no art 
collection, education, sensibility or style can buy their way onto the board and chair a gala. 
The New York Times sends photographer Bill Cunningham and the next Sunday her photo appears as a social/cultural 
doyenne and people begin to believe she is "special". Her gala was filled with tacky rich people like Bob Hurst- a 
complete jerk. The whole scene is a bad joke with the higher goal of cultivation of the arts. I have always had a very low 
regard for the manufactured "art scene". 
#3. Cannes, The Carlton...I went to four top designers and got the most gorgeous gowns. I have put together a schedule of 
the best films and parties. I am excited about writing my 3rd Cannes Diary...and already dreaming about the sounds of the 
bottle cnincher at dawn outside my window overlooking the dark smelly alley. Just kidding. Just beyond grateful I am 
going.... 
Trying to lay low this weekend to get rid of my cold. Sending my idiot brother, his idiot wife, my idiot mother and my 
recovering niece to "Lend Me a Tenor" Sunday matinee and dreading meeting them at the hot Jean George restaurant in the 
new Mark Hotel. 
Home most of the day...xoxo Peg 
How are you feeling?
