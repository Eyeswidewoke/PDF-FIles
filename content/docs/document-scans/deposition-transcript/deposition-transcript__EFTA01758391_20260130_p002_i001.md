followed=yields (more than they did the more hawkish Fed message). =OTTOM LINE — the Fed was hawkish and stocks 
sold off BUT keep in=mind the S&P is still up WTD and stocks (once again) care a lot more about the volatility in other 
asset classes than they do the =ctual FOMC message (i.e. it appears that Fl once again was caught =latfooted and 
required the larger price adjustment and this transiti=n spooked stocks more than the QE schedule did). Selling 
wasn&#.2173 super aggressive Wed afternoon and (as has been the case for a while=now) thin liquidity played a big 
part in the swoon. Stepping b=ck, the S&P (looking back over the last several weeks) still =an't be accused of doing more 
than consolidating/digesting =it is less than 3% off the recent all time nominal high). With the=Fed now out of the way 
and aside from the June flash PMIs (China Wed night= US/Europe Thurs morning) the calendar will quiet down again 
until=the week of Jul 1 (the week of Jul 1 brings all the big June eco numbers inc. the US jobs as well as ECB/BOE 
meetings. Note that attend=nce/volumes will be impacted by the 7/4 US holiday this week). =OADuring the week of Jul 
8, the CQ2 earnings season will kick-off (=A is Mon night 7/8) and the minutes from this 6/19 meeting hit on Wed Jul =0.
