Stars And Stripe., (7/18, Vandiver, 30K) reports a US intelligence gathering hub at RAF Molesworth "could 
stay where it is as the Pentagon reconsiders a plan to move the center to a different site." Pentagon 
spokeswoman Lt. Col. Carla M. Gleason said in a statement, "The Department of Defense is currently re-
assessing the future location of the Joint Intelligence Analysis Complex and the NATO Intelligence Fusion 
Center." The Pentagon stopped short of "saying whether it is considering scrapping a plan to build a new 
center at RAF Croughton, which would include $200 million in upgrades, and keep the intelligence activities 
at Molesworth." The Senate's 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which still requires House approval, 
"calls for funds to build an `intelligence fusion center' and `battlefield information collection and exploitation 
system center' at Molesworth." The Senate NDAA "did not specify how canceling the move would affect the 
$200 million slated for the Croughton project."

_and  
who testified he was still a threat." On the CBS Evening Newsidea. (7/18, story 5, 
1:40, O'Donnell, 251K), Mola Lenghi reported, "Prosecutors argued if granted bail, the 66-year-old was a 
significant flight risk, pointing to what they found in a safe in his Manhattan townhouse, $70,000 in cash, 
dozens of diamond, and a fake foreign passport that had expired." CBS also mentioned that Epstein is "a 
former friend of the President," and "many, including Mr. Trump, have now distanced themselves from the 
multimillionaire." 
The Daily Beast (7/18, Briquelet, I.39M) reports that US District Judge Richard Berman "said the 
evidence offered by federal prosecutors that it was too risky to release the globe-trotting financier appeared 
`strong.' The evidence includes testimony of victims, some of whom were minor girls when they were 
allegedly sexually abused by Mr. Epstein; other witnesses, including potential coconspirators; physical 
evidence, including passports reflecting extensive foreign travel; sexually suggestive photographs of nude 
underage girls; plea discussions; and police reports describing witness tampering and intimidation,' Berman 
wrote in a 33-page opinion." 
The Palm Beach (FL) Daily News (7/18, Musgrave, 21K) reports, "Multimillionaire Epstein has pleaded 
not guilty to the charges revealed in a July 8 indictment." Federal prosecutors "accuse Epstein of luring dozens 
of underage girls to his Palm Beach mansion and his townhouse in New York for nude massages that, for most, 
led to sex." Judge Berman "also said he was swayed by Epstein accusers 
and former Palm 
Beach County resident 
. Both testified at Epstein's bond hearing on Monday, a landmark 
moment in which Epstein was confronted in open court by his accusers. `I would ask there be no bond for the 
safety of the other girls, like me, who were sexually abused, 
told Berman on Monday while Epstein 
looked on impassively. `He's a scary person.' 
The New York Post (7/18, Denney, Golding, 4.57M) reports that Judge Berman's "decision to deny 
Jeffrey Epstein bail will encourage more women to come forward with allegations of sexual abuse when they 
were underage girls, a lawyer for several accusers said Thursday." Judge Berman's ruling "made it `safer for 
everyone' to come forward against the multimillionaire financier and convicted pedophile, lawyer Sigrid 
McCawley said." McCawley "predicted that the number of current Epstein accusers was 'just the tip of the 
iceberg' and said that she had signed up four new clients following Epstein's July 6 arrest. 'They've been 
living in this cage of fear and intimidation ever since he committed these horrible crimes against them,' she 
said." McCawley "wouldn't identify her new clients but said she encouraged them to report their alleged abuse 
to the FBI." 
Illinois Man Sentenced To Life For Murder Of Chinese Student. 
Reuters (7/18, Chiarito) reports, "An Illinois man described by prosecutors as obsessed with serial killers was 
sentenced to life in prison on Thursday for the kidnapping and decapitation of a Chinese graduate student two 
years ago." A federal jury in Peoria, Illinois "found Brendt Christensen, 29, guilty last month of all charges in 
the murder of Yingying Zhang, a 26-year-old student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign," and
