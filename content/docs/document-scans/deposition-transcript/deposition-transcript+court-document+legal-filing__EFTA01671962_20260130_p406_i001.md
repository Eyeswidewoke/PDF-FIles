Important Changes to Your Account Terms 
The terms of the account referenced in or with this notice are subject to change in accordance with the Cardmember 
Agreement governing the account (the "Agreement"). This notice formally amends the Agreement as described below. Any 
terms in the Agreement conflicting with these changes are replaced fully and completely. Terms not changed by this notice 
remain in full force and effect. We encourage you to read this notice, share it with additional Cardmembers on your account. 
and file it for future reference. If you have any questions about these changes, please call the number on the back of your 
Card. 
Late Payment Fee 
We are clarifying how late payment fees work on your account: 
• 
If your account has a Pay Over Time feature or balance, your late fee will be up to $35. 
• 
If your account does not have a Pay Over Time feature or balance, your late fee will be up to $35. However, if you 
do not pay for two billing periods in a row, your late fee will be $35 or 2.99% of the past due amount, whichever is 
greater. 
Effective January 18, 2013, the How Rates and Fees Work section of Part 1 of the Cardmember Agreement is amended by 
deleting the Late Payment row and replacing it with the following: 
Late Payment 
Accounts without a Pay Over Time Feature or Balance' Up to $35. However, if you do not pay the 
Amount Due for two billing periods in a row, your late fee will be $35 or 2.99% of the past due 
amount, whichever is greater. 
• 
Your first late fee is $25. This late fee will be charged if you do not pay the Amount Due on 
your billing statement before the 10th day after the Closing Date shown on your next billing 
statement. If you do this again within the next 6 billing periods, your late fee is 335 instead. 
• 
However, if you do not pay the Amount Due for two or more billing periods in a row, your late 
fee will be $35 or 2.99% of the past due amount, whichever is greater. This late fee will be 
charged on the Closing Date of the second consecutive billing period, and, if the Amount 
Due remains unpaid, on each Closing Date after that. 
• 
Your late fee will never exceed the Amount Due. 
Accounts with a Pay Over Time Feature or Balance: Up to 335. 
• 
Your first late fee is $25. If you pay late again within the next 6 billing periods, your late fee is 
$35 instead. However, your late fee will never exceed the Minimum Payment Due. 
• 
The applicable late fee will be charged if you do not pay the Minimum Payment Due on your 
billing statement before the 101h day after the Closing Date shown on your next billing 
statement, and, if the Minimum Payment Due remains unpaid, on each Closing Date after 
that. 
• 
Paying late may also result in a Penalty APR. See Penalty APR for new transactions and 
Penalty APR for existing balances above. 
In certain circumstances, because of the timing of the late fee charges described above, a billing 
statement may reflect two late fees, each one charged with respect to a different billing period. 
About Pay Over Time Features 
Effective January 1, 2013, the fourth paragraph of the About Pay Over Time features section is deleted and replaced with: 
We assign a Pay Over Time limit to your Account. We will not place any charge into a Pay Over Time balance if it causes 
the total of your Pay Over Time balances to go over your Pay Over Time limit. We may reduce or increase this amount. 
We may do so even if you pay on time and your Account is not in default. We will tell you if we change that amount. You 
must pay in full upon receipt of your billing statement all charges that are not placed into a Pay Over Time balance. We 
may change which charges are eligible to be placed into a Pay Over Time balance. 
Statement Copy Fee 
In the How Rates and Fees Work table, in Part 1 of your Cardmember Agreement, the Statement Copy row is deleted.
