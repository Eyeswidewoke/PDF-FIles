Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC):We use the Average 
Daily Balance method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying 
the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as desaibed below) for each feature (such as Purchase, Gash 
Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (including current transactions). To get the Average Daily 
Balance for each feature, we (1) take the begnning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid FC from previous 
billing periods), (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) subtractany payments or credits, and (4) make any 
appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day or the billing period, we also add en amount of 
Interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the daily periodic rate for the feature. 
This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beemniat  balance for the feature for the next day. If this 
ce
balan 
is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the d 
balances for the feature for the biling period 
and dvide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us tthe Average Daily Balance for the feature. For 
all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance will be considered to be zero if ypu 
paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the Payment Due Date shown on that 
statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number of days in the Oiling period and the 
daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that feature, except for variations caused ppvv
roaming. The total FC for the biding period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all features of the Account. 71(s
