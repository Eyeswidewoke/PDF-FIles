Important Changes to Your Account Terms 
The information below summarizes changes that are being made to your account terms. These changes will take 
effect January 25, 2019, and apply to statement cycles closing on or after that date. 
• 
Payment Changes:The following change is being made to your minimum payment calculation in 
Section 1201 Payments of your Consumer Credit Card Customer Agreement and Disclosure Statement

billed during the Billing Cycle for which the Minimum Payment is calculated plus 1% of the 
New Balance shown on the billing statement or

We require you to pay any amount over the limit of your credit card account. However, that amount is not 
included in your Minimum Payment Due. 
The Minimum Payment is rounded-up to the next highest whole dollar amount. Credits will not be used to 
meet the Minimum Payment.
