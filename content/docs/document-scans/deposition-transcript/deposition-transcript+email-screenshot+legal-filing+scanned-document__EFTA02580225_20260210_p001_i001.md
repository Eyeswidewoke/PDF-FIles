trying to d=rty me and the past is not i believe a helpful way for you to move f=rward. arrangments are pay for 
sex. . period=. not for months of school, advice, travel on your own to scho=l, no sex no payments . not listening 
for ho=rs to opinions. guidance , long term pay for sex. = as you should recall there was nosex , but plenty of 
advice.=C2 all ignored. 
when you reaz=ie what friendship means. and the role you play in destr=ying any hope of 
one. you might begin to grow. lyi=g to friends is worse than family, somoen made a choice to be a frie=d it wasnt 
genetic. im confident you will find a way to =larity. . it wont be easy. but you can only get there in mu op=on with 
being honest WITH YOURSELF.. good luck . =lease do not respond ,
