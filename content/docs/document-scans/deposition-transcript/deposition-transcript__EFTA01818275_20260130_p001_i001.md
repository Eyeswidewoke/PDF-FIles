Subject Re: 
you should read your own e mails... // first the smirk comes from the fact that managin the staff 
schedules. is the most trivial of tasks, not a responsibility. if done correctly it takes no longer than 
30 minutes a day. , It is not what I need or want. , it is not what i asked you to do, but what you 
think you should do... i wasn't asking you if you thoughtMnade sense, I was merely telling 
you what i am doing. the recitation of what i had done , confirmed that the assoistance i had 
previoulsy ask you for, can be accomplished in three hours. ) still no office chair , but i will go 
myself today).. IT is silly, you say get back to real life.--- you mean your life. I have kept my 
promise toyou. the atmosphere in the house is unsustainable. Henry jarecki came with his 
entourage, the help i talk about is not scheduling igor, but being a friend and helping making 
things PLEASANT COMFORTABLE, EASY. in this regard I need say no more. 
I will take 
full, blame.however =-. I CAN"T live with anyone in my house full time. it has little to do with 
you, I sent you a famous essay on its difficulties, so that a dead person could explain it.

I just got out of the gym. 
I would love to see ball-e but as I told you before the trainer has to deliver her to the house and 
set up for her to continue the training as well as walk me through the commands and hand 
signals Ball-e learned. I can't take the dog without the new instruction manual.. 
I already told you what I thought would help but you dismissed it with a smirk. I asked you for 
more responsibility and being in charge of the staff so I can devote real time to doing this (like 
flying) without feeling like I am just wasting time running another random errand even Luella 
could have done. 
I tried to explain to you when you just ask me to run one errand I try to get it over with as 
quicly as I can so I can go back to the real life as opposed to having a real responsibility which 
is a Part of my daily life. In an hour you forget I did it, ask me why I did nothing to help and 
we are both unhappy. 
This is the same suggestion I have been making for a l000ng time now but you ignore it every 
time and end the argument with the same 'I don't actually need you to do anything as long as 
you are never in a bad mood' That works until you forget about it, start comparing me to your 
employees, call me selfish, then I get in a bad mood and the cycle starts again.. How about you 
actually let me do it this time. 
is leaving so I have 3 weeks to 'play. 
I am already reducing my man-oh-foldover pressure and my flaps are coming up. 
I can't remember what else you were unhappy about, remind me. 
That's very nice of simona to bicycle to your house that early and make you breakfast. I am sure 
it is very tasty. 
Your last email makes no sense to me if it is not meant simply as complaining and giving me a 
list of your and your employees errands today compared to my not being there. I must be 
reading it wrong, I don't know what you are trying to say..
