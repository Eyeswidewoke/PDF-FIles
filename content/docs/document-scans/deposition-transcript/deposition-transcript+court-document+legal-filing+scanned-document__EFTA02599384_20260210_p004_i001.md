5. 
Phaidon Global LLC will transfer its shares of JMWT to JMWT Manager =LC. 
There will be no liquidator appointed and it is therefore essential that th= directors/LIP members are able to identify all 
the assets and liabilities=of the LLP, Topco and Midco. 
There will be no need to wait for an entity to be dissolved before the next=step can be taken. It should therefore be 
possible to complete the steps f=irly quickly. 
We hold the register of members for the LLP and this has not been updated t= reflect Phaidon Global LLC and JMWT 
Manager LLC becoming members of the L=P and PLB LLC and JMWT LLC ceasing to be members, as we were not aware 
of =he transfer of partnership interests. We have also checked the public regi=ters and note that the public registers do 
not reflect the change in the m=mbership of the LLP. As an initial step, it will therefore be necessary to=pass ratification 
resolutions of the LIP members to confirm the membership=of the LLP and update the registers accordingly. If Phaidon 
Global LLC and=1MVVT Manager LLC can be included as members from now (rather than ratifyin= historic membership), 
this will be a much easier (and preferable) process= Have Phaidon Global LLC and JMWT Manager LLC taken any action 
as members =f the LLP to date? 
We have based the steps on the following assumptions: 
the LLP, Topco and Midco have no liabilities (they have given n= guarantees, entered into no contracts, there are 
no loan arrangements in =lace (intra-group or otherwise) and they have no creditors); 
• 
the share capital of Topco exceeds the value of the Midco share= by at least £1 (this will enable us to reduce the 
capital of Topco, lea=ing El of capital to create sufficient distributable profits to enable t="e shares of Midco to be 
transferred to the LLCs as a dividend in specie); 
the share capital of Midco exceeds the value of the JMWT shares=by at least £1; 
the LLP, Topco and Midco have no assets other than the shares o= Topco, Midco and JMWT (respectively); 
accounts/balance sheets of Topco and Midco will be provided to =how the assets and liabilities of Topco and 
Midco before each company redu=es its share capital, and also an updated balance sheet will be provided f=llowing 
completion of the capital reduction. It is possible to just have a=counts/balance sheets for the position following the 
capital reduction, bu= as the directors will have personal liability for the solvency statements=they make in connection 
with the capital reduction, it is preferable for t=em to have accounts/balance sheets to refer to at the time the solvency 
st=tements are made; 
accounts/a balance sheet will be provided for the LLP to show t=e assets and liabilities of the LLP at the time of the 
distribution of ass=ts to the members; 
the LLP Agreement dated 3 October 2012 was signed; 
JMWT Manager LLC entered into a deed of adherence to the LLP Ag=eement (we have seen the deed of adherence 
signed by Phaidon Global LLC); =nd 
• 
the members confirmed the termination of membership of PLB, LLC=and JMWT LLC as members of the LLP (in 
addition to transferring interests =n the partnership to the incoming members which is included in the "reorga=ization 
agreement").
