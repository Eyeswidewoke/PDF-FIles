Page 7 of 10 
life of an Executor which is included in my estate, such Executor shall not participate in the 
decision to exercise or not exercise any fiduciary power in connection with any incidents of 
ownership for such policy or annuity, including, without limitation, any decision to continue, 
assign, terminate or convert such policy or annuity or to name the beneficiary of such policy or 
annuity. 
E. 
An Executor hereunder may by a written notice delivered to 
the other Executor decline to participate in the decision to exercise or not exercise any fiduciary 
power granted by this Will or by law. 
F. 
If an Executor is not empowered (because of a conflict of 
interest, declination to act or otherwise) to participate in the decision to exercise or not exercise 
any fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law, then the remaining Executor shall be 
empowered to make such decision. If no Executor is empowered to participate in such decision, 
then the successor Executor of my estate designated in Paragraph A of Article THIRD and able 
and willing to act shall be empowered to make such decision. If no Executor or successor Executor 
is empowered to participate in such decision, my Executor may designate a successor Executor to 
serve as Executor of my estate who shall be empowered to make such decision but shall have no 
other power or authority of my Executor. Such designation shall be by written notice delivered to 
such successor Executor. 
G. 
(I) 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this 
Paragraph G(1) of this Article, and except as provided in Paragraph G(2) of this Article, my 
Executor shall allocate receipts and disbursements in accordance with sound trust accounting 
principles and shall have discretion to allocate receipts and disbursements when the treatment is 
uncertain under applicable laws or generally accepted accounting principles in the judgment of 
my Executor. 
(2) 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this 
Will, my Executor shall not treat any part of the principal amount of the proceeds of sale of any 
asset of my estate as income distributable to or for the benefit of any beneficiary entitled to 
distributions of income; provided, however, that my Executor shall treat a portion of any proceeds 
of sale of any financial instrument originally issued or acquired at a discount equal to the amount 
which (a) has previously been characterized as ordinary income for income tax purposes or (b) 
will be characterized as ordinary income for income tax purposes in the year of such sale, as 
income for trust accounting purposes. 
FIFTH: 
Where a party to any proceeding with respect to my estate has the 
same interest as a person under a disability, it shall not be necessary to serve legal process on the 
person under a disability. 
SIXTH: 
If any beneficiary under the Trust shall in any way directly or 
indirectly (a) contest or object to the probate of my Will or to the validity of any disposition or 
provision of my Will or of the Trust or (b) institute or prosecute, or be in any way directly or 
indirectly instrumental in the institution or prosecution of, any action, proceeding, contest, 
objection or claim for the purpose of setting aside or invalidating my Will or the Trust or any 
disposition therein or provision thereof, then I direct that (a) any and all provisions in the Trust
