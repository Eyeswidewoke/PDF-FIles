I can come over to your office on Sunday to review the below 
I have cc Randy and howie so we can all address this first point 
1/First - we had always agreed once the project started to be delayed=along with AP not being funded a 
new $800k budget was needed for the resta=rant-this budget was based from the day of funding - and with a September 
=pening — which so far neither obviously has happened 
we both had agreed to personally fund the restaurant with $200k each =this was back before summer 
when we thought we would open in late August.c/=pan> 
Then in September when you where relaying on Arcade to fund a bridge =oan - and we needed funds to 
complete time and weather sensitive construct=on items - ie the new roof, sidewalk and other items -which I funded -
we =oth agreed to fund construction with $200k and where to be repaid when Arcade funded -
-Arcade walked away from the loan and we where never reimbursed 
-Then when Crescendo stepped in to advance you the 3.5mm loan -you ad=ised them that $750k was 
going to the restaurant - this is not correct- wh= you positioned the proceeds this way is not accurate 
We both need to be reimbursed from the Crescendo hotel loan -my loan =s higher then $200k at this 
point - but reimburse each of us so we can the= personally fund the restaurant- as we agreed upon 
So the hotels additional funding of the restaurant is $350 k not $750=/span> 
2/ Still to be addressed - which you have not responded to - is an ou=line as to the possible shortfall in 
the restaurant we could endure from J=nuary to April - complete budget sent to you weeks ago 
3/ I'm told you only are funding the restaurant $700 k becaus= you subtracted last weeks PR ? This is not 
correct in addition there are =P items that are not the restaurant responsibility -ie tasting for bankers=and loan people -
the charity event on Monday to promote the hotel • we can address this at tomorrows meeting 
4/ AP - how these accounts are paid off- following the AP list you ad=ised lenders would be cured - you 
need to complete before they lean the ho=el- as a few have threatened 
5/ Construction- Friday's meeting with skyland seemed to put =s on track -issue now is how hard will 
they push to complete in next 2 wee=s - we need gary on board -I hear he is waiting for his payment before he =ill 
resume -but we can complete if everyone gets aggressive and bring trades back to site 
We need plumbing and Electric punch list items - Chefs are working on=their list we will need gary to 
complete hotels items -especially items ne=ded for tco 
6/ Speakeasy as skyland pointed out at yesterday's meeting an= we both understood -there is little they 
need to contractually complete i= the speakeasy as most items are now change orders going forward 
Items to complete will be reviewed on Monday with Tara - skyland and =ary 
- your office has still not answered where the banquette fabric is - =or starters 
Banquets- to be built 
-Lighting will reviewed with Tara on Monday -
-front vestibule landing 
Bar entire unit 
Need to address that AC unit in the new area at bar we developed. $ 7= 
One AP item that needs to ASAP be paid is the soundproofing- we will =eed this also in the speakeasy 
bar area - 
7/ When will you be in your office on Sunday - I'll come over=as you suggested on Friday 
As we need a great outline prior to Monday's hopefully jump s=art to complete lobby in 10 days-
speakeasy in 3 weeks 
hopefully we can then try to get some xmas party business - looking a= the hotels occupancy it falls off 
the cliff after 12/18 but maybe we can =apture some business - this brings me back to the restaurants operating bu=get -
we need to address a possible winter shortfall above the $750 k opening budget
