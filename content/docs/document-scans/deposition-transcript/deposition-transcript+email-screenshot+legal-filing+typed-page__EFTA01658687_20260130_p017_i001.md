Tuesday said that leaks have become a serious problem, justifying the move by Ratcliffe to limit 
election-security briefings. Nunes told Fox Business' Lou Dobbs, "We know that someone on the 
Democratic side is a leaker, and they've been leaking a really long time, not to mention they 
also like to go through our telephone numbers and release them to the public." Nunes added, 
"We're very concerned about this. We have relayed those concerns to the intelligence agencies."

Issues. The Daily Beast (9/2, Brodey, 1.39M) reports that in a September 1 letter, Rep. Raja

More Commentary. Peter Grier writes for the Christian Science Monitor (9/2, 246K) 
that the decision to provide written intelligence products instead of in-person briefings is 
"hardly" a "dry bureaucratic change." Written documents "are not a good substitute for in-
person discussion when it comes to congressional oversight of the executive branch, say some 
experts. In person, members can gauge tone, ask questions, push for answers, and raise side 
issues. This is particularly important in intelligence oversight, where outside sources of 
information are scanty at best." 
In a Lawfare (9/2) podcast, Benjamin Wittes discusses the decision to end broad election 
security briefings with David Priess, "a former CIA briefer who used to do briefings like this, and 
Margaret Taylor, a former congressional staffer who used to consume briefings like this."

White House National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said, "The United States is

reprehensible." Ullyot continued, "We will work with allies and the international community to 
hold those in Russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads, and restrict funds for their 
malign activities." He added, "The Russian people have a right to express their views peacefully 
without fear of retribution of any kind, and certainly not with chemical agents." Other global 
leaders have condemned the attack, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, European 
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, 
who tweeted, "I utterly condemn the use of a military-grade nerve agent, which makes it even 
more urgent that Russia conducts full & transparent investigation." 
Reuters (9/2, Landay, Hosenball) reports a US government source "familiar with U.S. 
intelligence reporting said there was no reason to doubt the German finding that a Novichok 
nerve agent was used to poison Navalny, a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin." 
ABC World News TonightVi 's (9/2, story 9, 1:25, Llamas, 6.93M) Ian Pannell reported,

reports that according to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, "Kremlin critic" Alexei Navalny, 
"who is in intensive care in a Berlin hospital, was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve 
agent in an attempt to murder him." Reuters say Merkel indicated that her government "now 
expected Moscow to explain itself and that Germany would consult its NATO allies about how to 
respond, raising the prospect of new Western sanctions on Russia." According to Reuters, "The 
Russian foreign ministry said Germany's assertion was not backed by evidence and complained 
about the way Germany had chosen to release information about Navalny." A US government 
source "familiar with US intelligence reporting and analysis said the use of the Novichok family 
of nerve agents showed Putin was willing to be `bold' in targeting individuals he found
