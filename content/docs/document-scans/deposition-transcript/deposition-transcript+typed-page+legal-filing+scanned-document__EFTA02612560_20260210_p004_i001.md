interstate wires to in=uce a sex offense), and 18 USC 1591 (prohibiting commercial sex trafficking and=the use of force 
and fraud for commercial sex) to Mr. Epstein's case, a=d the factual allegations against Mr. Epstein would not reasonably 
permit such an unorthodox application. The allegations in Mr. Epstein's case had the common characteristics of a 
paradigm =tate prostitution offense where he, Mr. Epstein, allegedly paid young women for =assages and occasionally 
for sexual contact in his own home, where he did not induc= anyone to meet him via the internet, where he did not 
commercially traffic =he women for his own economic benefit, and where, as a result, his offenses, although alleged to 
be numerous, were exclusively a matter of state crimina= law. Published Department of Justice policy guidelines were 
that such were matters to be addressed exclusively through the state prosecutorial system. Moreover, critical elements 
required to establish a federal nexus to these allegations of state crimes necessary to support a conviction under a=y of 
the above federal statutes were in the firm opinion of Mr. Epstein*=99s legal team conspicuously absent, or at best 
very close questions, such that Mr. Epstein attorneys strongly believed he could well have been acquitted at tr=al or 
exonerated on appeal.

apan> The Agreement, now under media siege resulted from classic negotiations between=two 
independent Parties where the Government achieved, without risking acquitta= or detrimental legal precedent, much of 
what it sought — imprisonment,=probation, restitution, sex offender registration, and the facilitation of witness-vic=ims 
financial settlements — and where defense counsel, including the un=ersigned, properly discharged their professional 
responsibilities, gaining for their client (a= occurs in every negotiation) a moderation of the maximum potential penalty 
=n exchange for an agreement not to seek an acquittal or other legal challenge= 
<=pan> 
apan> And for any criticism that crime victim rights were violated because they were not consulted 
before the Agreement w=s signed, it is absolutely essential to remember that in 2007 the established= published, 
nationwide policy of the Department of Justice required neither consultation with nor notification to any alleged victim 
where, as was true=in this case, there had been no charges, indictment or information of federal crimes issued. In 
requesting compliance with established, published Department of Justice policies, Mr. Epstein0=800s legal team 
discharged their ethical and legal obligations in the representation o= their client. Moreover, the federal government 
has already provided numerous legitimate explanations for the decisions it made regarding consultation and notification 
under the Crime Victims Rights Act in its filings in the United States District Court case filed in the Southern District of 
Florida, Doe v. United States, case no. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM. We wou=d encourage anyone interested in the truth to do 
what the Miami Herald has failed to do, conduct a full review o= the government's papers in order to gain a thoughtful 
view of their=position before leaping to inappropriate conclusions and perpetuating absurd conspir=cy theories about 
influence and corruption at a venerated office of the United States Attorney. Whatever their reasons, however, 
notification and consultation decisions were within the exclusive purview of the Government, and Mr. Epstein's 
attorneys ultimately c=uld not have any say in the matter. 
<=pan> 
apan> In 2008 Mr. Epstein went to jail and was given the same work release treatment that was 
conferred by prison official= on others. Thereafter he was released under strict probationary conditions which he met. 
He has registered for life as a sex offender in multiple jurisdictio=s, has fully and diligently complied with his registration 
obligations, and continues to do so. He has made substantial victim payments, paid the court-appointed victim legal 
representative significant fees, and helped line the pockets of a multitude of personal in=ury attorneys in cases where 
Mr. Epstein was required to agree not to and did n=t contest liability (a unique benefit to the witnesses). S=nce the end 
of the criminal case, Mr. Epstein has lived for 11 years without further incident. He has been a productive and law-
abiding citizen, avoiding any condu=t that does not carefully conform to the requirements of both federal and sta=e law.
