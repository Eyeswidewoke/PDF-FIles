probably similar or connected in some way. 
in previous emails I have been referring to "shapes" as a metaphor for those structures. shapes do not have an input 
/output . a failing of the computational analogies. let me try this , a cell membrane, has a shape, it separates inner 
from outer. it is easy to see what is inside or out. the shape of the membrane is determined solely by a probability 
distribution. nothing more. The tons of works on spoken language seem in vain to try to make of the mechanism from 
a minuscule sampling of the combinatorics . silly. in the elephant and the blind man story , they are not even close to 
touching the elephant they are fascinated by its droppings.

It's true that grammars stand outside of time, a fact that many linguists and psychologists don't understand. There are 
suggestions of something like a "universal UG," though not couched in just these terms. Notably Michael Sherman's 
theory that a universal genome appeared at about the time of the Cambrian explosion, and all forms of life are minor 
variants of it.

1. dont you have any questions about money, . ? ? finance. . ? I owe you some knowledge . 
2 .to say the shape can be" decribed " by language is redundant. 
the "shape" is the metaphor for an n-dimentional object , it stands outside of time. as do grammars , but sentences do 
not, they require time. 
the shape is somewhat like a fitness landscape? contrasted with communication which also 
requires a time dimension and biololgy that needs and uses energy . I suggest the mammal Ug is a subcategory of all 
UG.s . and that as biology prefers redundancy . the other modules, ie vision are small distortions of it. 
3. during that UN period I often give a " money 101 to world leaders who have in many case. . little knowledge of a 
subject to which they give many speeches and policy directives , as they only have experinces such as that of a 
general , a politicitain, in some instancees a disk jockey, before having to run their country. I would love to consider 
some of what you thought was " fair " . with regard. allocations. if you were running the show.

I follow up to the point where you write "the organizing principle of the shape is language..." No doubt it can (partially) 
be described in language, but that's not what you mean. 
Zipf's law is a rank-frequency distribution. And also meaningless, as Mandelbrot showed 60 years ago. I hope Yang is 
clear about this. He surely knows.
