quarantine," accusing him of creating "the dangerous situation in Kaesong City that may lead to 
a deadly and destructive disaster." 
European Countries See "Worrying Rise" In New Coronavirus Cases. 
The Washington Post (7/28, Morris, Birnbaum, Steinhaus, 14.2M) reports "countries across 
Europe that had brought their coronavirus outbreaks under control are now seeing a worrying 
rise in cases, as health officials warn that lax public attitudes are putting the continent on a 
dangerous trajectory." In fact, "a spike in infections is leading Belgium to ramp up restrictions 
on social contact, while Spain has closed gyms and nightclubs in Barcelona. In France, the 
government announced that the initial progress made in a strict two-month lockdown has more 
or less evaporated." At the same time, "German health officials have called a rise in infections 
in the past two weeks deeply concerning." 
The Washington Times (7/28, Meier, 492K) reports "Spain and other EU countries...are 
facing pressure to clamp down again as they tentatively reopen public life." 
Spain Criticizes UK, Germany For Advising Tourists To Stay Away. Reuters (7/28, 
Melander, Young, Sheahan) reports Spain "reacted angrily on Tuesday to recommendations 
from Britain and Germany that their citizens avoid its islands and beaches because of an 
increase in coronavirus cases." With travel advisories "piling up on top of a quarantine order 
from Britain for returning travellers, Spain, which depends on summer visits by sun-seeking 
northern Europeans, is facing a major blow to any hopes of reviving its economy." 
WPost: EU Succeeded In Suppressing Outbreak Due "Quality Of Leadership." In 
an editorial, the Washington Post (7/28, 14.2M) says "European Union nations, having largely 
succeeded in suppressing covid-19 infections, are returning to something resembling normal 
life, with schools, shops and businesses reopening." The Post argues that the most conspicuous 
difference between these countries and the US "might be quality of leadership." Though Europe 
"could still be hammered by another wave of infections," the Post says "the union nevertheless 
has been made stronger by the crisis, thanks to responsible leaders willing to make tough 
decisions and impose unpopular measures." 
WS3ournal: Global Increases Show Lockdowns Won't Stop Virus' Spread. 
The Wall Street Journal (7/28, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) editorializes that the recent 
increase in cases around the world disprove arguments that the reopening of parts of the US 
happened too quickly are to blame for America's virus resurgence. The increases, it argues, 
also indicate that lockdowns will not stop the spread of the virus. 
Iranian Military Exercise Includes Attack On Mock US Aircraft Carrier. 
The CBS Evening NewsVI (7/28, story 9, 0:20, O'Donnell, 4.37M) reported, "War games by the 
Iranian military are again raising tensions with the US in the Persian Gulf," with Iran firing 
missiles "at a mock US aircraft carrier" and then boarding it. 
USA Today (7/28, Hjelmgaard, 10.31M) reports that the "war games and military drills 
that illustrate the persistent threat of conflict between Tehran and Washington." US Navy Fifth 
Fleet spokeswoman Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich said in an emailed statement that the Navy was 
aware of the military exercise involving the mock Nimitz-class carrier. Iran conducted a similar 
exercise in 2015, when it sank a replica US aircraft carrier. 
Similarly, the AP (7/28, Gambrell) reports that the exercise and the US response 
"underlined the lingering threat of military conflict between Iran and the U.S." Missiles fired by 
the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during "the drill resulted in American troops being put on 
alert at Al-Dhafra Air Base in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and Al-Udeid Air Base, the 
forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command in Qatar." Rebarich condemned 
"this type of irresponsible and reckless behavior by Iran in the vicinity of busy international 
waterways."
