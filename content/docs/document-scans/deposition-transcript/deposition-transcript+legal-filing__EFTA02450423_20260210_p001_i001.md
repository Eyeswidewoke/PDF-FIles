even tell me you were coming. The fac= that you are in Europe and you don't want to see me makes me believe =hat I'm 
not so important for you since it's more than 6months that=we don't see each other... I would prefer for you to be 
honest wi=h me instead of making up excuses, same as when I wanted to come to NY. I =now you have a girlfriend and 
you don't want her to know about me but = don't understand why, since we are not together or even seeing each o=her. 
I thought we were friends...? 
I'm a 100% gratefu= everyday for what I have and what you give me, thank you. I don't kno= how I would make

always be by your side if you have any problem. I really have a lot of r=spect and affection for you this is why seeing this 
whole situation and th= way you are distancing yourself from me makes me extremely sad... </=iv> 
Today, I found a job despite the fact that I know that none of you= girls in NY is working. I know you are trying to 
help me (thank you).=A0but I don't understand this contradiction. I hope that one day = will be able to make my way

things really work but I don't see myself as horrible as you s=y I am. 
Maybe you will not like this message and will take =t as a whining but contrary I believe that venting my pain is 
healthi=r than suppress it with drugs. I prefer to be honest and clear with y=u instead of pretending of being ok when 
I'm not. By writing you this =essage I'm leaving aside my pride since I believe a relationship with =o communication is 
fake and I don't want to be fake with you. 
Love you...
