Brad is really at 10. being gracious and above reproach in this negotiation will go a long way to stopping steve 
from trashing you. you are right about the pr and i am very sensitve to it. I will handle it moving toward with jay, you 
can always blame jay , we will tell brad that you have removed yourself. I will charge you a one million dollar fee ( i 
will not get insulted if you choose not to ). Right at the end, not for jay, I will attempt to specifillay get samsung 
approved. letting steve feel good that he fucked you already , will minimize the moving forward , so i do not want to 
give up the higher amount demadn until the very last minute

My gosh, I am s000 sorry that I was not explicit in showing my appreciation. I am deeply appreciative 
from the moment of referral to you checking in on things to the side dialogs you've had. I'm terribly sorry I did not 
express that in a way that made it clear. 
Thank you. 
I'm more than happy to turn this over to you. Any fee you want is fine. That isn't an issue for me at all. 
Or if you don't want to be involved that is fine too. I would rather be friends more than anything. 
I'd like you to be involved. I just want you to understand a little more about the situation. It is more 
nuanced than a money negotiation i think. 
We've both done lots of contracts and have both been more involved with lawyers tons more than we 
would have liked. But in very different ways and with different business situations. Together we bring almost too much 
experience. :) 
For me, the currency in this negotiation isn't money. Steve doesn't care about the money because he 
knows I am not motivated by the money. The most important thing for Steve is foreclosing options for me. That is why 
he did the negative stuff about me. The second most important thing is just feeling like he won. That means he gets to 
brag about something. Me being a vc is a victory for him. Me being a startup CEO is a victory. Samsung is a clean loss. 
I have been part of a dozen lawsuits filed after Microsoft people went to competitors. It is nasty, public, 
and ultimately Microsoft prevailed in all of them. Either the person backed down or ended up so tarnished they were 
ineffective. The suits are filed regardless of the work--"inevitable leakage of trade secrets". 
PR is part of foreclosing options. People do remember pr. Read about "Kai Fu Lee". He was branded 
ineffective and then left google as ineffective. He was a traitor then and is now a traitor to China. Maybe he is all of 
those in reality, but he was also a leading Carnegie Melon computer scientist. 
This goes back to the 80's and is always done. Senior people leave and there is a lawsuit if they go to a 
competitor. Always. 
If I choose to be a manager of people, especially a large group, then that group will know about me 
almost exclusively through what they read about me. I don't get a chance to charm them. And because of the lag time
