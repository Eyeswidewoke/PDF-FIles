Addit=onally, as it relates to a May timeline, that is too short of a notice for=me — with heavy prior 
commitments I would not have the time =o see it through properly and provide a quality, reliable system. Force th= 
construction of a system like this and it is bound to be problematic and =n the end people will be unhappy. I'm not 
willing to have my clien=s be unhappy. 
Details — Our system would use Ubiquiti Air Fiber an=ennas operating at either 5GHZ and/or 24GHZ, and 
very likely a combination=of both. These are quality gigabit rated microwave antennas at a reasonabl= price. We have 
been using them for our gigabit feed and they have been fl=wless. As you know with microwave there is degradation of 
the signal as di=tances increase and the objective is always to maximize the bandwidth at t=e end user destination. This 
is why we would likely partition the ba=dwidth at the feed and send it thru multiple radios to the destinati=n. This has 
the added benefit of redundancy. 
As to how much bandwidth you =uy from Century Link, I'd strongly recommend getting a gigabit. It=E2s 
not much more than their 500mbs package and when you have 20 or =0 devices using the bandwidth you will be happier 
with the 1000mbs. Also f=ctor in the signal loss from the feed to the destination. 
Plan B and C - = believe the best plan B is to find another property within a 5-10 mile l=ne of site 
proximity that is adjacent to live Century Link Gigabit Fiber. =ither lease or purchase the property, put in power, build an 
enclosure for=the hand-off router, install an antenna and then we have our feed. This is=what I ended up doing on our 
ranch. 
=A0 
Plan C would be the Sandia Crest. Dif=iculty of access, expense, and such a large distance makes it less 
than ithal for a point to point radio shot. It would take incredibly expensive ind=strial/military grade equipment to 
mitigate significant signal degradation= While our 5GHZ radios are rated out to 100 miles and 1Gig, I expect we wo=Id be 
lucky to get 30% of the bandwidth thru. 
Century Link — Annet=e Armstrong and Jerry Folsom from Century Link have been awesome. Their 
fo=low up has been impressive and we are lucky to have them. I know that the =urrent rate quote expires (this week I 
think). Unfortunately, without an a=reement from the Singleton's, this just might have to pass. The gr=undwork has 
been laid, however and I don't expect their rates will=be going up anytime soon. The most important thing is that we 
have confirm=d that we can get gigabit fiber in the Galisteo area. 
Numbers - At this po=nt in the project Lali and I have been focused on determining A) is gigabi= fiber 
available at the Singleton Site, B) is a radio shot possible from S=ngleton to Zorro, and C) can the cost of the feed site 
infrastructure be s=ared. The answer to the last question is pending. Once we have an answer t= that then we can 
finalize the cost of the build. 
What I can tell you is t=at the cost of getting power to the Singleton feed location is in the $15k=range, a 
prefab air conditioned shipping container is in the $17K range (d=livered), towers (depending on what they will allow us 
to erect), would be=in the $5 - $10K range (feed side only). Beyond that, we haven't d=termined numbers for the radios, 
routers, commissioning of the system etc.=There are dozens of options/decisions on that point and we will need to ha=e 
another meeting to discuss that and establish your baseline expectations= 
Wait until the end of the week,=or should we proceed with plan B?

Stan=ey, NM
