Barr "indicts these people for crimes - the greatest political crime in history - then we are 
going to get little satisfaction unless I win...because I won't forget it. But, there people should 
be indicted. This was the greatest political crime in the history of our country and that includes 
Obama and it includes Biden." Trump later said in an interview on Fox News' Hannity (10/8, 
535K), "We caught them spying on our campaign. This is treason. We caught them trying to 
take down a duly elected Administration/President and we have all the evidence now. We have 
to see what the law enforcement is going to do with it, but we caught them spying - as sure as 
you are sitting there." 
The New York Times (10/8, Baker, Haberman, 18.61M) reports Trump "berated his own 
cabinet officers on Thursday for not prosecuting or implicating his political enemies, lashing out 
even as he announced that he planned to return to the campaign trail on Saturday just nine 
days after he tested positive for the coronavirus." The President "has not been seen in person 
since returning from the hospital on Monday, but he sought to reassert himself on the public 
stage with a pair of telephone interviews with Fox News and Fox Business, a video and a series 
of Twitter messages." The President "castigated his own team, declaring that" Barr "would go 
down in history `as a very sad, sad situation' if he did not indict Democrats" like former Vice 
President Biden and former President Obama. Trump "complained that Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo had not released Hillary Clinton's emails, saying, `I'm not happy about him for that 
reason." He also targeted FBI Director Wray, saying, "He's been disappointing." 
The AP (10/8, Balsamo, Miller, Tucker) reports President Trump "is increasingly at odds" 
with Barr "over the status of the Justice Department's investigation into the origin of the Russia 
probe, with the president increasingly critical about a lack of arrests and Barr frustrated by 
Trump's public pronouncements about the case, according to people familiar with the matter." 
The President "and his allies had high hopes for the investigation led by Connecticut US 
Attorney John Durham, betting it would expose what they see as wrongdoing when the FBI 
opened a case into whether the Trump campaign was coordinating with Russia to sway the 
2016 election." However, "a year and a half into the investigation, and with less than one month 
until Election Day, there has been only one criminal case." Barr "has privately expressed 
frustration over the public comments, according to a person familiar with his thinking." 
Durham Reportedly Seeking Grand Jury Testimony To Investigate New Front In 
Russian Probe. The Daily Caller (10/8, 716K) reports, "US Attorney John Durham has 
reportedly opened a new front in his investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe." 
According to a report by The New Yorker, the Caller says, "Durham is seeking grand jury 
testimony from computer scientists behind an allegation that Donald Trump's real estate 
company had a secret communications channel with Alfa Bank." The theory "was first floated in 
October 2016, but was debunked in the Justice Department inspector general's report on the 
FBI's investigation of the Trump campaign." Durham "is also reportedly seeking the testimony of 
Daniel Jones, a former Senate Intelligence Committee investigator who partnered with Fusion 
GPS and Christopher Steele in 2017." 
Former Trump Fundraiser Charged With Illegally Lobbying For Malaysian Fugitive. 
The AP (10/8) reports that Elliott Broidy, "a prominent fundraiser for President Donald Trump 
and the Republican Party, has been charged in an illicit lobbying campaign aimed at getting the 
Trump administration to drop an investigation into the multibillion-dollar looting of a Malaysian 
state investment fund." According to the AP, Broidy is "the latest person accused by the Justice 
Department of participating in the covert lobbying effort." 
The New York Times (10/8, Vogel, 18.61M) reports Broidy "was charged with a single 
count of conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act as part of an influence 
operation that prosecutors say sought to use his political ties to help Malaysian and Chinese 
interests, according to federal court filings that became public on Thursday." The Washington 
Post (10/8, Zapotosky, 14.2M) reports prosecutors "believe he took millions in undisclosed 
money to end a US investigation into a billion-dollar embezzlement of a Malaysian state
