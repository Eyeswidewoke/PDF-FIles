million cases, a testament to just how rapidly the virus is spreading - the first 1 million cases 
took more than three months." 
The New York Times (11/15, Rabin, 18.61M) reports the spread of the coronavirus "began 
accelerating across much of the country in mid-October. It took just over two weeks for the 
nation to go from eight million cases to nine million on Oct. 30; from nine to 10 million took 
only 10 days." The Times adds that the US "logged more than 159,100 new cases on Saturday, 
the third highest total of the pandemic, raising the new seven-day average to more than 
145,000, with upward trends in 48 states and an 80 percent increase in new cases from the 
average two weeks ago." Reuters (11/15, Abraham, Gupta) says the latest 7-day average 
"shows the United States is reporting more than 144,000 daily cases and 1,120 daily deaths, 
the highest for any country in the world." 
In addition, Bloomberg (11/15, 4.73M) says that on Sunday, Florida "reported the most 
new infections since July," California "reached a three-month high," and New Jersey "counted 
record Covid-19 cases for the second straight day." The AP (11/15) reports that West Virginia 
on Sunday "set another weekly record for the number of confirmed coronavirus cases, even 
with one day left to count." 
On the CBS Weekend NewsVi (11/15, story 2, 2:15, Yuccas, 12.6M), Lilia Luciano said, 
"Hospitalizations across the country now at a record high of more than 69,000. The worst hot 
spots, North and South Dakota, which lead the nation in highest death rates." CBS News chief 
medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook: "People need to know we not going to suddenly be back 
to normal. It is going to be gradual change over the course of 2021." 
Meanwhile, Trevor Ault reported on the lead ABC World News TonightVi (11/15, lead story, 
4:30, Llamas, 4.5M) segment that hospitalizations "are climbing in every state except 
Massachusetts and South Carolina." Ault added that the coronavirus is "now claiming more than 
1,000 American lives a day, a 60 percent jump from October." The Wall Street Journal (11/15, 
Al, McKay, Ailworth, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports on its front page that unlike the 
previous waves of the coronavirus, Americans are being infected nationwide and a Wall Street 
Journal (11/15, Bender, Dalton, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) article headlined "As Covid-19 
Surges, The Big Unknown Is Where People Are Getting Infected" says that health officials 
seeking to respond are struggling to determine how Americans are contracting the coronavirus. 
The AP (11/15, Izaguirre) reports that despite "painstaking efforts to keep election sites 
safe, some poll workers who came in contact with voters on Election Day have tested positive 
for the coronavirus, including more than two dozen in Missouri and others in New York, Iowa, 
Indiana and Virginia." According to the AP, "The infections cannot be tied definitively to polling 
places. Because COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in the U.S., there is no way to determine yet 
whether in-person voting on Election Day contributed to the surge, public health experts said. 
Still, the infections among poll workers raise concerns because of how many people passed 
through voting sites, which implemented social-distancing rules, erected protective barriers and 
stocked sanitizer, masks, gloves and other safety gear. In most places, poll workers were 
required to wear masks." 
Meanwhile, NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/15, story 8, 2:50, Snow, 3.53M) senior medical 
correspondent Dr. John Torres "asked five top infectious disease doctors across the country how 
have your Thanksgiving plans changed." A front-page Wall Street Journal (11/15, Al, Passy, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M) article titled "The Hottest Ticket In Town This Year Is Your 
Family's Covid-Constrained Thanksgiving" also reports on how the pandemic is impacting 
holiday preparations. 
Meanwhile, on NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/15, story 6, 2:25, Snow, 3.53M), Blayne 
Alexander reported college students nationwide will soon be returning home for Thanksgiving, 
which "experts worry...could potentially bring the virus home for the holidays." Alexander 
outlined some precautions that schools are taking to prevent such an outcome from taking 
place.
