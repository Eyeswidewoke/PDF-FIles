revenues fell 3.7% YoY in June. This is the first drop since 2009, but some are attributing this to the effects of the World 
Cup. 
Turning to the day ahead, the rest of the global manufacturing PMIs/ISMs will be released starting with the final PM's for 
Europe. The US manufacturing ISM is expected to show a small bump up to 55.9 (vs 55.4 in May) which would mark a 
six month high. DB is expecting a print of 55.0. Other highlights on the US data docket are May construction spending 
and the IBDITIPP economic optimism index. 
YTD performance review 
In YTD terms, of the main indices we track the FTSE-MIB (+14.5%) and the IBEX (+12.8%) have been the star 
performers. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian bonds have not been far behind. Interestingly commodities make up quite a 
few of the other top ten places (with the CRB index, Gold, Silver and Oil returning between 7-11%), but also 2 of the 
worst 3 with Wheat and Copper both down more than 6%. Also negative was Chinese equities (-1.5%) after 
disappointing growth in H1 which may explain some part of the weakness for certain commodities. The Nikkei (4.1%) 
was the only other asset lower YTD in our sample. Apart from these four all the other assets saw a positive 2014 total 
return. Credit has put in a good performance in 2014 so far with most major indices returning between 4-7% which is 
impressive in the low yield, low spread environment. 
For the full numbers for the year, O2 and June see the charts and tables in today's pdf. We also show the YTD numbers 
all converted to dollars. 
Happy H2!
