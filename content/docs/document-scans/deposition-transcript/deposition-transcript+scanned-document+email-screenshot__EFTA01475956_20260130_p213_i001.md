World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
There is plenty of room for the terminal rate to go up and for the bond risk 
premium to turn positive. Starting in late 2012, the Fed began lowering its 
"long run" policy rate in sync with its forecast of lower long-run real GDP 
growth, from 2.5% to 2%, which corresponds to average headline GDP growth 
in this recovery. But with the drag from the government shrinking since early 
2014 and private sector GDP growth running at 3%, underlying headline 
growth has already moved up to 2.4%. As the government sector begins to 
cease being a drag, headline real GDP growth should lift to 3% and the 
terminal rate to 4.5% (3+2-0.5). With the bond risk premium (BRP) an 
unprecedented negative through the Fed's calendar rate guidance, it turned 
positive around the taper but is back to around zero. We look at the BRP 
relative to the lOy as this normalizes for prevailing duration. 
Historically, the 
BRP ranged from 0% to 40% of the lOy yield, averaging 22%. That would be 
as additional 44 bps on the current 10y, about what the Fed seems to be 
assuming. The BRP has also been historically correlated with the US current 
account deficit as much of it was financed by the foreign official sector, 
which 
bought Treasuries for Official Reserves. The present current account deficit 
points to 25% of the lOy yield, so similar (55bps) but slightly higher BRP. 
Credit spreads tighten with higher rates but over-allocations keep fixed 
income 
vulnerable: HY over HG. It is generally assumed that higher rates mean wider 
credit spreads, i.e., that the beta of credit spreads to the lOy yield is 
positive; 
the betas of both HG and HY spreads to the lOy have in fact always been 
negative (Credit After The Taper Reset, August 2013). HG has been the largest 
recipient of inflows in fixed income and with spread compression (beta less 
than 1) insufficient to offset the impact of higher rates, negative total 
returns 
leave them vulnerable to outflows. HY much less so. 
The equity risk premium is at a 70-year high; it is perfectly negatively 
correlated with the lOy yield. The equity risk premium (the equity discount 
rate 
less Treasury yields) is a very hefty 8% (Cycles in the Equity Discount Rate 
and 
Risk Premium, Apr 2015). Prior to this cycle, the last time it was this high 
was 
in the 1950s post-World War II recovery period. It remains 3pp wider than it 
was pre-financial crisis. The equity risk premium has historically been 
strongly 
negatively correlated with the lOy Treasury yield. With a beta around -1, a 
rise 
in the lOy yield should see the equity risk premium shrink by a commensurate 
amount. Indeed a 3 percentage point rise in lOy yields that shrunk the equity 
risk premium by a commensurate amount in line with the historical pattern 
would take it back down only to where it was prior to the financial crisis, 
i e., 
equities look to be priced for significantly higher yields and then some.
