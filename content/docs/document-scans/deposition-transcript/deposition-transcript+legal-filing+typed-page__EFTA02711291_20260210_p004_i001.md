boundary, in the mind.V9
Any definition empties the world as it creates it. Empties it of all life. Any definition of the world fixes it. If it is fixed, it is 
dead. Only by a name do we know what is dead. Only through a category do we comprehend the unreal. Names and 
categories, names and definitions: comfort words. And ficenothing has been changed except what is unreal, as if nothing had 
been changed at all.ail Disposable world: comfort words: thereaTMs no getting rid of them without naming them and their 
contraptions, thataTMs the thing to keep in mind. 
In a world with no signification, in a world where psychic, social, and functional resolution is impossible, in a world where life 
lies hidden in language . . . the fate of the author is to have nothing, absolutely nothing to say. The book is a lie, the words 
have no author. To live in this world beyond the world, a world of words with no beyond, the author does not write about the 
world. Any attempt to do so is merely another fiction in a world of fictions. The aim of the book must be to attract subtlety, 
to attract complexity. But then, this is not a book, it has nothing to do with books, with literature. It canaTMt be read: itaTMs 
performance. Performance without a player. The author has no intention of its meaning. 
ficeAll the notions by which we have lived are tottering. The sciences are calling the tune:132 Knowledge is now transitional. 
The real is no longer neatly delimited. Place, time, and matter admit of liberties that, not long ago, no one had an inkling of. 
Common sense is now appealed to only by the ignorant. The value of ordinary evidence is down to zero. What was once 
believed by all, always and everywhere, seems no longer to carry much weight." Knowledge is now transitional: harms 
something to forget. 
When knowledge enters the room, forget it. None of the categories work, all explanations are wrong. Description vs. 
explanation: explanation is always wrong. ItaTMs a world of words, of descriptions, and acedescription comes to an end, and 
we realize that it has left nothing behind it: it has instituted a double movement of creation and destruction.V4
Knowledge: the expression fleet° know everythinga has as its complement the word universe. But to know everything 
includes knowing that the universe isnaTMt even there. The universe is the big con. Our widest possible knowledge-world 
generalization has dissolved into metaphysical ha-ha. 
Universe is the big con. Physical theory is no longer ficerealitylt We got lost ficeonce speculation was concerned no longer 
with subphenomena assumed to be similar to the phenomena directly observed, but rather with ficethingsii that in no way 
resemble the things we know, since they only send us signals which we interpret as best we can. Plus our language, and our 
logic, our concepts have been found wanting: all this intellectual material will not fit into the nucleus of an atom, where 
everything is without precedent, without shape. Debatable probabilities have taken the place of definite and distinct facts and 
the fimdamental distinction between observation and its object is no longer conceivable:VI 
What in the world has happened? ficeSimply that our means of investigation and action have far outstripped our means of 
representation and understanding. This is the enormous new fact that results from all the other new facts. This one is 
positively transcendent:AY' 
ficeThe squirming facts exceed the squamous mind.V7 This new fact is positively transcendent. But in the new world, 
nonworld of this new fact, there can be no transcendence. The world is finite: it canaTMt fit into the terminology, into the
