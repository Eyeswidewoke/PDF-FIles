(j) 
For so long as any of the Securities are Outstanding, the Issuer shall not register 
the transfer of any Issuer Ordinary Shares to U.S. persons. 
Section 2.5. 
Transfer and Exchange of Securities. 
(a) 
No Holder and no holder of a beneficial interest in a Security may, in any 
transaction or series of transactions, directly or indirectly (each of the following a "transfer"), 
(i) sell, assign or otherwise in any manner dispose of all or part of its beneficial interest in any 
Security, whether by act, deed, merger or otherwise, or (ii) mortgage, pledge or create a lien or 
security interest in such beneficial interest unless such transfer satisfies the conditions set forth in 
this Section 2.5 and Section 2.4. No purported transfer of any beneficial interest in any Security 
or any portion thereof that is not made in accordance with this Section 2.5 and Section 2.4 or that 
would have the effect of causing either of the Co-Issuers or the pool of Collateral to be required 
to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act shall be given effect by 
or be binding upon the Applicable Issuer, the Trustee or any other Agent and any such purported 
transfer shall be null and void ab initio and vest in the transferee no rights against the Collateral, 
the Applicable Issuer, the Trustee or any other Agent. 
(b) 
No beneficial interest in a Security may be sold or transferred (including without 
limitation, by pledge or hypothecation) except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction 
not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act and exempt under applicable 
state securities laws or the applicable laws of any other jurisdiction. 
(c) 
No Security may be offered, sold or delivered or transferred (including, without 
limitation, by pledge or hypothecation) except (i) to (A) a non-"U.S. person" (as defined under 
Regulation S) in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S, (B) a QEB/QP or (C) in the 
case of Subordinated Notes, a Qualified Purchaser or a Knowledgeable Employee that is also an 
Accredited Investor and (ii) in accordance with any applicable law. 
No Security may be offered, sold or delivered (i) as part of the distribution by the Initial 
Purchaser at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the Closing Date within the United 
States or to, or for the benefit of, "U.S. persons" (as defined in Regulation S) except in 
accordance with Rule 144A or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities 
Act, to Persons purchasing for their own account or for the accounts of one or more Qualified 
Institutional Buyers for which the purchaser is acting as a fiduciary or agent. The Securities may 
be sold or resold, as the case may be, in offshore transactions to non-"U.S. persons" (as defined 
in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S. No Rule I44A Global Security may at any time be 
held by or on behalf of any Person that is not a QIB/QP, and no Regulation S Global Security 
may be held at any time by or on behalf of any U.S. person. Transfers of interests in a 
Regulation S Global Security to "U.S. persons" (as defined in Regulation S) shall be limited to 
transfers made pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.5(eXi) or 2.5(eXviii). Except as expressly 
provided in clauses (i), (ii), (vii) and (viii) of Section 2.5(e), transfers of a Global Security shall 
be limited to transfers thereof in whole, but not in part, to nominees of the Depository, to a 
successor of the Depository or such successor's nominee appointed pursuant to Section 2.10(a) 
hereof. None of the Co-Issuers, the Trustee or any other Person may register the Securities under 
the Securities Act or any state securities laws or the applicable laws of any other jurisdiction.
