2333 19th Century English Novel 
Faculty: Dims, Nicholas 
MW 10:00 AM - 11:40AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 6686 Sec A 
This course surveys the novel in Britain at the nineteenth-century height of its formal development 
and confidence. The vast majority of our books are (to use the title of the periodical edited by 
Charles Dickens) 'household words', with well-known characters and plots that have been 
treasured for generations and have become cultural common currency even with people who have 
not read them. As my friend, who many years ago worked in a bookstore once commented. 'these 
are the classics that people will come into the store and buy right off the shelf'. With these 
authors, the novel combines ingenious plotting and a sense of emotional life, comedy and passion. 
droll idiosyncrasies with convictions of the heart. Fully in command of its own imaginative 
procedures, the nineteenth century novel became a form in which a society in the midst of rapid 
and turbulent change chronicled Its own transformation and that of the idea of the self without 
which society is not meaningful.
