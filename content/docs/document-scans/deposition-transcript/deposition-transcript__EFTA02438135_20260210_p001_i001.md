Read you email. That is not a response to my email, you are ignoring what I said and just go on 
about what YOU want and what errands there were to run.. 
I obviously consider 
worth talking about. Did she stay at the house?

i needed help, thats it no more. no less, . i have a monstrous amount of 
work in progress. 1 ave asked for your help . . the garage is a pigstye. I am no further ahead 
with landscape lights, dock, statue base, the house has dog shit and piss,I have cleaned it up 
myself I, and not challenged you. I went through kitchen and house things without you , in an 
effort not to embarass you. especaillly in front of others. since before 
left on her vacation. 
you wanted authoriity , no food, flowers, facial, helper, / i love you, and want you to be happy. I 
need help to reduce my workload, I think you should re read your emails to me. I asked you to 
set aside time to talk , you chose not to, . brice valdson, lynn and jojo, need to brought in to help

 to try out. story to do local things. kichen doors, etc. As I have tried to explain , 
an agreement has two parties, you have chosen not to fulfill your part, it is your prerogative, 
besides making soups, which were great , as you followed the recipe, (a discipline that you abhor 
) , healthy snacks, low cholesterol, food, house projects , . I made a point not to argue, it has 
become silly I get angry, and nothing changes, therefore taking getting angry out of the equation 
seems to make sense, I have asked that you have a budget, it allows you to see what you spend 
and on what. it is also a reflection of what actually gets done. you have chosen not to do it. no 
problem.. I love you , so what am i to do? „ I need time to get my life in order , I would have 
hoped having you here would reduce my load ( not that load ). instead of adding stress and 
conflicts.
