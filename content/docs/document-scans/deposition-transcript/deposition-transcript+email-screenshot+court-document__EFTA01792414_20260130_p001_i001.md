closets=included. We left all storage items laid out in the catering kitch=n area on C-level for you to view, to decide 
what=is garbage , or what can be sold and what can be used in other h=mes. I am also putting a list together with

complete list that you approve .1 =ave also been working on a hot water heating problem that I discove=ed when the 
colder weather came in last week. The heating system upper re =eat Zones being supplied by AC-3 fan & the 5=h floor 
fan units heating was loosing water pressure effecting room temper=tures on the 4th & 5th floors. After various trouble 
shooting tests = found the shell & tube Heat exchanger #2 has a tube =eak and the re heat hot water was leaking out 
water pressure throug= the steam condensate line. This was causing the Re heat h=t water system pressure to drop 
and the re heat coils to get air b=und on the 5th & 6th floors. I have isolated heat exc=anger #2 until the tube bundle 
can be replaced ,we are operating off of =eat exchanger#1 with an extra steam bypass supply to make up the 
d=fferencein capacity all rooms are now making set points. I replaced=Heat exchanger #1 tube bundle about 2 years 
ago, #2 tube bundle which is=leaking is original to the house .The Source One project is =lso moving forward the full 
energy report and recommendations for system u= grades will be complete by 1/25/11 i am also waiting on Pricing fo= 
up grades that AD Winston is working on for free coo=ing & removal of the old Carrier Chiller and adding the additional 
2= tons of compressors to the new Air stack Chiller. I am als= in the process of setting up meetings with
