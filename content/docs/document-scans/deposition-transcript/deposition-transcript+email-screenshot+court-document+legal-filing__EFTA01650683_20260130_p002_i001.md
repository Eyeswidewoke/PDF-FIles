4.) 
Please provide an example of coordination of services with the USAO: The EDNY VWC and I coordinate frequently 
on cases. One specific has been on a gang / trafficking case that was just indicted January 20; but we had co-assisted the 
victim the past six months in grand jury prep. She would provide information regarding the process and witness fees; and I 
coordinated counseling services and OVS application. 
5.) 
What current gaps or challenges do you face that either inhibit or slow your ability to perform victim services 
work? Shelter continues to be an obstacle and I would benefit from speaking Spanish specifically with the Latino victims 
and MS-13 victims / families. 
6.) 
Please list your accomplishments providing training and outreach on Human Trafficking and Domestic Minor Sex 
Trafficking to the following organizations during FY 2019 (local, state, federal, and tribal government and law enforcement 
officials, NGOs, juvenile justice agencies, faith-based 
organizations, medical and dental health organizations, etc.). 
This past fiscal year the Long Island RA created a new squad that focused on sex trafficking in the Long Island area. I 
participated on the Suffolk County Trafficking taskforce; in addition to creating relationships with CPs and the juvenile 
facilities in both Nassau and Suffolk County. From the presentations and relationships there were case leads referred to 
us. 
6a.) 
If you've not provided training in the above areas, what significant accomplishments did you perform in FY19? As I 
relocated my desk to the JTTF — I created many new relationships with both local and Federal agencies regarding Mass 
Casualty response. 
7.) 
Are there any opportunities or ways in which you think we can increase and/or enhance victim services provided 
during an FBI investigation? If I learned Spanish with a focus on law enforcement language; I would be able to provide 
more direct assistance to the Latino victims specifically gangs/ MS-13. 
8.) 
Please provide the top two cases, within FY19, that illustrated your ability to work with internal and/or external 
partners, required a high level of attentiveness to the victim/victim population, the impact your involvement left on the 
victim(s) and/or their family, and any additional matters you'd like to highlight that supports your efforts. 
In the case 7B-NY-2126257 I provided a variety of services with many challenges. As the Agent, the victim and myself 
traveled to Djbouti to recover two minors who were abducted from NY to Yemen. From the beginning of this case I 
collaborated with local NGO's to assist the left behind mother; and during the travel worked closely with the Legat, State 
Department and other foreign entities to reunite the mother and children safely back to the United States. 
In case 31E-NY-30275671 / Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case. As this was a very high profile case and with much 
sensitivity due to prior mishandling by local and Federal authorities; I created professional relationships with local, 
Federal, and attorneys representing victims which resulted in more victim cooperation.
