Entered By.:

On Thursday, October 20, 2005 at approximately 0936 hours, I assisted 
in the execution of a search warrant located at 358 El Brillo Way, 
Palm Beach, Florida r 
nc of Jeffrey Epstein. I was instructed 
by Case Agent Det. 
, to secure all computer and media 
related material from t e rest ence. 
Upon my arrival I was directed by Det. 
to a room designated as 
the Kitchen staff office. I observed a...ver in color, CPU with the 
left side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware sitting on floor 
next to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or 
features indicating a make or model. This CPU was powered off with 
the power cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the 
CPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor, 
printer, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, 
observed an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware 
would allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPU s hard disk. 
The ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search 
and no external camera was located within this room. 
The CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel 
LCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative 
of a second computer; however, no other computer was found. It 
appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the 
cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same 
area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices, 
i.e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is 
commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media 
was found. 
After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned 
all items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis 
via a property receipt. 
I was then directed by Det. 
to a room designated as the Garden 
Room, where I observed a woo en esk facing west. The desk held a 
flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and 
printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed 
from an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk 
area revealed no signs of any media devices. 
Det. 
directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana 
room, which is detached from the residence and located just south of 
the pool. In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office 
type setting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor, 
keyboard, mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the 
cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A 
search of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.
