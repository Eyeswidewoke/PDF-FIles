from a lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Geklco is desperate to redefine himself in 
a different era. The New York Post runs a full-page photo of Geldco and New Yorkers immediately become obsessed 
with the filming of Wall Street 2. 
A week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver designs 
an elaborate tracking shut around the seal pool where Dekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake Moore, a young 
idealistic investment banker played by Shia Lalloeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, Moore's fiancee, played 
by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an off-screen romance with LaBoeuf Oliver played Cupid. Moore invites 
Dekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Dekko, who used to be a sponsor or honoree of 
such events. cannot even aftbrd a ticket. 
The shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In one 
take Michael makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on the set is 
courteous but quick and tense. There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. 
I watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers' canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff 
("Monsters Ball") and Celia Costes. who was a location manager on the rust "Wall Street." They have asked me to be 
an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. Oliver wants 
over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture gowns. "Give me the night before the Titanic goes down." were 
his exact words. Not a problem. 
I pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his personal 
publicist when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for "Wall Street" and we have remained great 
friends. Dekko is just as challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of technical financial dialogue. 
We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' Broadway debut in a "Little Night Music." Michael has a stack of partially finished 
handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts received for their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. 
Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. 
I tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him and 
the production. 
8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st. another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 65th 
Street and Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My hair is in 
rollers. Statuesque Julia Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white Valentino and long 
diamond earrings. Her real-life financial titan husband David is unaware where she is this morning. 
Vanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List. Amy Fine Collins. arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage 
Geoffrey Beene, and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow fake 
flower on his lapel. Costume Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gckko's rich slick look in the rust film, is 
ecstatic with the extras I invited. 
Oliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's "W"). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, a 
ruthless Wall Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-
year-old child prodigy in their huge, art-filial townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby 
Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the '60s. The production designer 
had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and replaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive 
contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's vision. 
At 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, and
