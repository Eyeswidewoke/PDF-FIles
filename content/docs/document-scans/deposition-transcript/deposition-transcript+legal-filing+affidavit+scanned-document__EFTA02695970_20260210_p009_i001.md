Let's talk about developing economies and one of the biggest sources of money people use to live. 
Money doesn't just come from the transactions for your own goods and services, but it comes from 
remittances. This is money sent from people who have emigrated and are making more money in 
another country. This is billions of dollars a year, even for Somaliland. In fact, a huge source of these 
funds is right here in Seattle, which has one of the largest Somali populations in the US (second to 
Minnesota). The closeness of family (clans) creates these centers of population. 
It has historically been very difficult to remit money and in a place lacking infrastructure (there is no 
postal system here) and addresses it is impossible. Remittances are commonplace in the Islamic world 
and are called, HIVJ.1 -I. In most Islamic areas there are services that have developed that replaced the 
person-to-person process used for centuries. In Somaliland, the global Dat'ob ni I is a for-profit that 
specializes in Hawala is used by many. Zaad is disrupting them to some degree, but also partners with 
them on the backend to actually do the transfer. 
Perhaps the coolest thing about Zaad is that it was built as a home grown system. All the work 
happened in Somaliland, according to the people we talked to. And they are very proud of that—it is 
created, owned, and operated by the TeleSom company. 
The role of banking as a platform element is well understood. But few of us could imagine building a 
banking system from scratch, and that is just what Zaad is. The positive reinforcement loop is readily 
apparent, to both the people using the service and to the folks that run TeleSom. 
There are some big questions that TeleSom will face as the service becomes ubiquitous. We had a 
chance to talk to the leaders of the service to learn more about how they will approach moving the 
system forward. 
Security. It is amazing to think that people with very small amounts of money will literally trust all their 
money to the phone company. Yet in a world where there are few entities to trust, the phone company 
is reliable and solves a lot of problems for you. In addition, TeleSom provides a great many transparency 
services. About 6 months after the service launched, a web-based system was introduced. One of the 
key benefits of this is being able to print out a full transaction history. This allows you to have your own 
records for future dispute resolution. And of course keep in mind that your photo and biometric 
identity are on hand. We had discussions about fraud, PIN-lockout, and so on and it seems to me they 
are at least as aware of the challenges and solutions as one could hope. 
Future services. One of the biggest areas for opportunity for Somaliland that is currently being 
considered is for the municipal government to find a way to use the service to pay taxes or to services 
such as utilities. There are some obstacles to doing this, first and foremost is that the government does 
business in Somaliland Shillings. M-Pesa became very complex because of all the services. It is not clear 
Zaad needs to do this right away but they also want to make sure they are aggressive. In talking with 
the folks it sounds like they are very much geared up for a feature war and want to move fast and not 
get left out.
