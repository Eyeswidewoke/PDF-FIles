Bernie Madoff, Jeffrey Epstein. Conrad Black and Michael Kagdis court cases evolve 
One Palm Beach-related court case wrapped up last month when Lin Gosman, wife of former health-care magnate Abe Gosman, received 
time served (one month) and three years probation in her bankruptcy fraud, mortgage fraud and tax fraud case. Lin Gosman, 60, had 
pleaded guilty to the charges, which arose out of her husband's multi-million dollar bankruptcy. 
Several high-profile court cases remain in the news for the upcoming season. 
Jeffrey Epstein 
Convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released from jail this summer and his secret deal with federal prosecutors was unsealed last 
month. 
But Epstein, 56, is still fighting more than a dozen lawsuits - state and federal - from young women who say they were sexually abused 
when they were minors. 
The lawsuits against the billionaire money manager all contain similar allegations: that a minor girl was taken to Epstein's mansion on El 
Brillo Way and led upstairs to a spa room by one of Epstein's assistants. where he would ask the girl to perform massages and/or various 
sex acts. for which he would pay her $200 or more. 
Among those suing Epstein: Jane Doe No. 3 and Jane Doe No. 5, who both say they fear Epstein and believe he should have gotten a 
harsher sentence. Both have filed federal lawsuits. 
Another victim, known as Jane Doe No. 102 in a federal lawsuit, alleges she was 15 when Epstein made her quit her $9 an hour job at The 
Mar-a-Lago Club to become what amounted to his sex slave. The lawsuit says Epstein traveled with her to many locations, requiring her to 
have sex with him and others. 
Epstein is serving his one-year probation in his Palm Beach mansion on El Brillo Way and is registered as a lifelong sex offender. He does 
not wear a monitoring device. 
He served 13 months of his 18-month sentence at the Palm Beach County Stockade for procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting 
prostitution. Instead of walking out through the main door where prisoners are routinely released, Epstein was allowed to leave the jail 
through a sally port, thereby avoiding awaiting media cameras. 
According to a nine-page federal non-prosecution agreement that was unsealed last month, Epstein could have been charged with 
multiple counts of five federal offenses involving sex acts with minors and faced a life sentence. 
Instead. the government agreed not to prosecute him or his procurers on federal charges if he spent 18 months in the county jail on two 
state charges. 
The agreement let Epstein and co-conspirators 
, Lesley Groff and 
off the hook for any past 
crimes. 
While serving his sentence, Epstein was allowed out of jail on liberal work-release terms. He was able to go to his West Palm Beach office 
for 16 hours a day, six days a week since October 2008. He also was allowed to go to his Palm Beach home in the weeks leading up to his 
release. 
Bernard Medoff 
Although Bernard Medoff is serving a 150-year sentence for orchestrating the largest Ponzi scheme in history, the effects of his crimes and 
the trail of his associates are still being revealed. 
Madoff, 71, is in federal prison after pleading guilty to multiple fraud charges. 
Palm Beach resident Robert Jaffe has been charged with fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly bringing 
more than $1 billion into Madoffs Ponzi scheme. 
Last month, the U.S. Attorneys Office in New York, which prosecuted the case, said the losses of Madoffs 2,336 victims exceeded $13 
billion. 
Earlier this month, Irving Picard. the trustee appointed to liquidate the Madoff investment business. filed a lawsuit against Madoffs brother. 
Peter Madoff. and three other family members. 
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, names Bernard Madoffs sons Andrew and Mark, and Peter Madoffs daughter 
Shana. The tour family members are alleged to have received $141 million in the six months prior to BernardMadoffs arrest in December.
