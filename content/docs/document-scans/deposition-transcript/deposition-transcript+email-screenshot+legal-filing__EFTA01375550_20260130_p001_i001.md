Glossary 
Alpha - Alpha is a measure of the difference between a portfolio's actual returns and its expected performance, given its level of risk as measured by beta. A positive Alpha figure indicates the portfolio has 
performed better than its beta would predict. In contrast, a negative Alpha indicates the portfolio has underperformed, given the expectations established by beta. Alpha is calculated by taking the excess 
average monthly return of the investment over the risk free rate and subtracting beta times the excess average monthly return of the benchmark over the risk free rate 
Beta - Beta is a measure of systematic risk with respect to a benchmark. Systematic risk is the tendency of the value of the fund and the value of benchmark to move together. Beta measures the sensitivity 
of the fundS excess return (total return minus the risk-free return) with respect to the benchmark's excess return that results from their systematic co-movement. It is the ratio of what the excess return of 
the 
fund would be to the excess return of the benchmark if there were no fund-specific sources of return. If beta is greater than one. movements in value of the fund that are associated with movements in the 
value of the benchmark tend to be amplified. If beta is one, they tend to be the same. and if betas less than one, they tend to be dampened. If such movements tend to be in opposite directions, beta is 
negative. Beta is measured as the slope of the regression of the excess return on the fund as the dependent variable and the excess return on the benchmark as the independent variable. 
The beta of the market is 1.00 by definition. Morningstar calculates beta by comparing a portfolio's excess return over T-bills to the benchmark's excess return over T-bills. so a beta of 1.10 shows that the 
portfolio has performed 10% better than its benchmark in up markets arid 10% worse in down markets, assuming all other factors remain constant. Conversely, a beta of 0.85 indicates that the portfolio's 
excess return is expected to perform 15% worse than the benchmark's excess return during up markets and 15% better during down markets 
Excess Return - This is a measure of an investment's return in excess of a benchmark. 
R2 - R-Squred reflects the percentage of a portfolio's movements that can be explained by movements in its benchmark. 
std Dev - Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement of dispersion about an average, which, for a mutual fund, depicts how widely the returns varied over a certain period of time. Investors use the 
standard deviation of historical performance to try to predict the range of returns that are most likely for a given fund. Men a fund has a high standard deviation, the predicted range of performance is wide. 
implying greater volatility. Standard deviation is most appropriate for measuring risk if it is for a fund that is an investor's only holding. The figure can not be combined for more than one fund because the 
standard deviation for a portfolio of multiple funds is a function of not only the individual standard deviations, but also of the degree of correlation among the funds' retums. Morningstar computes standard 
deviation using the trailing monthly total returns for the appropriate time period. All of the monthly standard deviations are then annualized. 
Sharpe Ratio - Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure developed by Nobel Laureate William Sharpe. It is calculated by using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. 
The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better the fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. The Sharpe ratio is calculated for the past 38-month period by dividing a fund's annualized excess returns by the 
standard deviation of a fund's annualized excess returns. Since this ratio uses standard deviation as its risk measure, it is most appropriately applied when analyzing a fund that is an investor's sole holding. 
Sortino Ratio - Sortino Ratio is similar to Sharpe Ratio except it uses downside risk (Downside Deviation) in the denominator. It was developed in early 1980's by Frank Sortino. Since upside variability is 
not necessarily a bad thing, Sortino ratio is sometimes more preferable than Sharpe ratio. 
Information Ratio - Information ratio is a risk-adjusted performance measure. The information ratio is a special version of the Shame Ratio in that the benchmark doesn't have to be the risk-free rate. The 
lsraelson method is an adjustment of the Information Ratio to take into account the inconsistency of the IR when excess returns are negative.
