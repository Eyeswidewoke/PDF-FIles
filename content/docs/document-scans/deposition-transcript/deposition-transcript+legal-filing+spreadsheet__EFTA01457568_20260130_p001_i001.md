Thesis 
PXD has dekneated a high-quality, multi-zone resource in the Midland basin that provides a top-tier resource oppodurity amongst the peers. 
Wide market's willingness to pay has outstripped our own valuation framework, the development plan was expected to hit an inflection point 
in 2015 which has now been delayed. 
OW view remains unchanged.
