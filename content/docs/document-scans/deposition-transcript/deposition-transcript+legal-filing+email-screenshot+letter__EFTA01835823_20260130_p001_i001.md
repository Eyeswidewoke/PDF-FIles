Hi Eva! 
There are several different sources, and it is a very competitive field. Few have been able to differentiate 
themselves enough to get attention of funders.You also need to be clear on what you want to do, how you will 
do it, and why you are the best positioned to do it. 
1. Infrastructural costs: bldgs and equipment are usually offered by rich individuals who have been touched by 
the disease in one way or another. Most will require matched funding and also request naming rights. 
2. Operational expensee: no one funds this. Donors are all looking to see that the business model is profitable 
and can sustain growth over at least the intermediate period. A few of the large infrastructure folks have offered 
a small grant for the non-recoverable costs associated with start up (like ads for hiring and other HR stuff) 
3. Science: this is a mixed bag. Clinical trials and such are funded by drug companies and in some cases the 
NIH. There are some groups like the Komen foundation. Avon or Revlon that offer support but they have a 
notoriously short attention span and usually fit into the last category. 
4. Awareness: I think this is a dumb category but it seems to get the most publicity since celebrities and donors 
looking for name recognition (=CSR) are always trolling for opportunity. In addition to the names above, you 
might also look at Atena (a water company). You can go to IRS.gov and do a scan for charities and search 
"breast". Then you can look through 990s and see who actually funds what they say they do and how much they 
give. The main problem will be that you can only search by name and some are family foundations without the 
word "breast" in them. Charity Navigator (http://www.charitynavioatororoi is also a great place to search and 
you can use any terms you'd like. 
I have a few ideas for you, some very outside the box. 
1. As a charitable organization, like COLIC! or maybe some others that you know about, you can make loans in 
addition to grants. They are called PRIs (or program-related grants). They must meet with the charitable mission 
of the org and do require some painful due diligence but they result in below market rate loans. If what you need 
money for will eventually generate revenue or pay itself off, this might be a great use of a PRI. You just need to 
find a charitable organization that can leverage their balance sheet and has the same interests. Depending on 
who they are, you might talk about an equity stake and/or loan forgiveness (they need to be sophisticated...) or 
you can go the easy route with regular debt. 
2. JEE might not like this idea but I have always thought that Victoria's Secret doesn't do enough here. They are 
all about breasts...lf they have a foundation you should structure something really cool like a 5 year grant, some 
publicity and a PRI. But you'd have to have a unique story a super business plan. The IRS watches closely.
