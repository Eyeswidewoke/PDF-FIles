Hello Jeffrey! Sorry for not answering so long, Im ok. But Im lying Im not =k. but its personal. Just feeling 
too bad inside and fed up of everything =ere. Im at work all day and my skype is online here every work day from 9 =o 6. 
but I cant talk. then usually I go home and study. Trying to do my be=t with marks to have scholarship. Writing to you 
right now with tears in m= eyes but I cant cry on my workplace and mascara is too expensive to spoil= To tell the truth I 
feel like Im living to take everybody's problems =nd wishes and nobody wanta to hear me. I dont speak with my parents. 
From =hat time. My only parents who loved me all my life and each other also, do=sn't do it to me and between them 
also anymore. it hurts. I know they =ove me, Im not a 13 year child to blame them that they dont love me its st=pid. but 
the fact is that we are not together. Trully, when I came here, i= was good. My friends missed me, my boyfrend took 
care of me, helped to fi=d a job, put his sholder when i need that. I gave him every happy moment l=could. I was with 
him my first time. That was my second time after you. yo= was the other person who changed me. You have seen how 
afraid i was, how =hy I was and you made me a woman, you made me feel like a woman. You made =e beleive that MI 
beautiful and you like it. I remember everything and I u=ed it. Week ago I understood that he had another girlfriend and 
she is goo= smart virgin. I know thats stupid for you and you even shouldnt read that=shit Im writing to you. But I want. 
Not because I dont have anyone to shar= with, but because it is you. It is so difficult you know, the person to w=om you 
beleived and who told you hourly how does he want to change my last=name to his... Oh, whatever. Im much stronger 
than he thinks. Than everybo=y thinks. Im tired of being here. If I only had a chance my dream would be=a flight next 
minute. Im trying to make my visa, I have been consultaing s=me representatives from embassy but nothing heared 
from them. Remember I b=ought you a letter. so I cant understand my situation clearly, maybe you c=n know. Jeffrey 
knows everything huh =) so I officialy ws changing my vi=a from J1 to B2 and I officialy had rights to stay in US untill I will 
rec=ive an answer despite the fact that my j1 visa expired at october. Alla di= the same and she got her letter in 
November with "yes" and then=went home. I was waiting untill the end of January with the words WE ne=d more 
documents why u stay here untill 16th of February. I went home at 1=th. I didnt hear the no and didnt hear the yes. 
What if I could not have c=ance to fligh away in october but I need it in November what should I do w=thout the letter 
which came only in January? And I have my ticket from Oct=ber, it is expired but I had it can be a document that I just 
became sick =nd couldnt go home. This is the first problem the second is court and you =now about it. I dont think they 
can give me jl student visa its ridiculous=l should give them something more serious and reasonable. I will think abo=t it. 
Concerning my teeth I started them, the took off one of them the day=before yesterday and it didnt hurt , I remembered
