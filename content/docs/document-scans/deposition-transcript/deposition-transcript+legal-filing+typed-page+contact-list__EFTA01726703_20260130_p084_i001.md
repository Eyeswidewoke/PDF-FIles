Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC):We use the Average 
Daily Balance method to calailate FC on your AceOurit. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying 
the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for each feature (such as Purchase, Cash 
Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (includng current transactions). To get the Average Daily 
Balance for each feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for the feature each day (ineudrng unpaid FC from previous 
billing periods),
u  (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any 
appropriate a ustments. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also add an amount of 
interest eq 
to the previous days daily balance multiplied by the daily periodic rate for the feature.
This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for the next day. If this 
balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all, the at, balances for the feature for the biting period 
and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. Thus gives us the Average Daily Balance for the feature. For 
all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance wil be considered to be zero if yOu 
paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the Payment Due Date shown on that 
statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number of days in the baling period and the 
daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by
rounding. The total FC for the billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all features of the Account. This 
method of calculating the Average Daffy Balance and FC results In daily compounding of FC. The minimum 
FC for any billing periodin whith FC are imposed is $0.50.
