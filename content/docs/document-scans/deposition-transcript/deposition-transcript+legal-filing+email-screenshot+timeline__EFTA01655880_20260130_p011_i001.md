A Student Was Raped and Murdered in Her Fiancé's Apartment on Valentine's Day. Forty Years Later, 
Genealogists Finally Crack the Case 
The Independent (08/15, Hawkinson) reported that genealogists have identified the man suspected of killing a 22-
year-old Texas college student in a 40-year-old cold case. Tern McAdams was at her fiancé's Arlington, Texas 
apartment on Valentine's Day, 1985. Her fiancé was out of town on a business trip, so McAdams decided to make 
him a heart-shaped cake. Afterward, she called her soon-to-be sister-in-law, CBS News reports. However, moments 
after hanging up the phone, someone entered through a sliding door in the bedroom before beating, sexually 
assaulting and killing McAdams. Her body was found in the apartment by a maintenance worker. The article stated 
that for nearly 40 years, McAdams' case went unsolved. However, advanced technology and "investigative genetic 
genealogy" have allowed police to identify her suspected killer: Bernard Sharp. The article added that nine months 
after Sharp is thought to have killed McAdams, he was involved in another string of killings in Arlington. He shot 
three people, killing two, before dying by suicide, police said. The article mentioned that for decades, police could 
not link Sharp to the murder because they had no DNA samples. However, earlier this year, investigators identified 
a close relative who provided DNA. Using their sample, genealogists determined Sharp was a genetic match to the 
DNA found in the apartment of McAdams' fiancé. The article quoted Chad Yarbrough, a Special Agent in Charge of 
the FBI in Dallas, who said, "Investigative genetic genealogy is one of the most valuable tools that law enforcement 
has access to today." KWTX (CBS-10) (08/15, Ashley), and the Huffington Post (08/15, Moorhouse) also reported on 
the story. 
Continued Reporting: Illinois Deputy Police Chief Pleads Not Guilty to Bankruptcy Fraud Charges 
CBS News (08/15, Ramos) reported that Dolton's acting police chief appeared before a federal judge and pleaded 
not guilty on Thursday to multiple charges of bankruptcy fraud and perjury, among others. It was just the latest in 
an ongoing saga of controversy surrounding the Dolton village government. Acting police chief Lewis Lacey made 
his initial appearance in court for his arraignment. The judge ordered that he turn in his gun and FOID card as a pre-
trial condition. The article stated that in court, federal prosecutors laid out the nine-count indictment against Lacey, 
claiming he devised a scheme to defraud, by way of filing a bankruptcy in an effort to hide assets and income to 
avoid paying more than $40,000 in a lawsuit settlement that goes back nearly a decade. Prosecutors said as part of 
the scheme, Lacey repeatedly lied about his monthly income and concealed multiple bank accounts that he 
controlled. He also lied, they said, about being separated from his wife. Lacey said he lived alone, which prevented 
creditors from going after her. The article mentioned that the federal indictment happened in the shadow of 
ongoing turmoil in the Village of Dolton where Mayor Tiffany Henyard has been under investigation for alleged 
misuse of village funds. A recent report released by former Chicago mayor-turned special investigator Lon Lightfoot 
showed that the village had a staggering $3.5 million budget deficit. The report also highlighted how some village 
employees racked up overtime, specifically Lacey, who received almost $216,000 in overtime since 2022. 
FBI Raids Virginia County Property of Well-Known Russia Expert 
Rappahannock News (08/15, Staff Writer) reported that federal agents descended on a Huntly property Tuesday 
and have maintained a steady presence there since. The article quoted FBI spokesperson Samantha Shero, who 
said, "The FBI conducted court-authorized law enforcement activity. We have no further comment as this is an 
ongoing matter." The article stated that Rappahannock County Circuit Court records show the 132.6-acre property 
was sold by Katherine Krebser to Dimitri K. Simes and his wife Anastasia R. Simes for $1.63 million in July 2021. 
Dimitri Simes, 76, has been well known in the Washington, D.C., diplomatic world for decades and is considered an 
expert in Russian affairs. He was the longtime president and chief executive officer of the Center for the National 
Interest, a public policy think tank founded by former President Richard Nixon. Simes left the center in 2022. 
Pennsylvania Man Accused of Making Threats to FBI Found Incompetent to Stand Trial 
Penn Live (08/15, Beauge) reported that a Montour County man accused of making threats against the FBI has 
been found mentally incompetent to stand trial. U.S. Middle District Judge Matthew W. Brann on Thursday ordered 
the government to hospitalize Thomas Green, 32, of Danville, for up to four months for treatment. The article 
stated that during that time a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist is to determine if there is a substantial 
probability in the foreseeable future that he will attain the capacity to permit his trial to proceed.
