that we have adequate time to review them prior to the change of plea and sentencing. 
As to the type of sentence that Mr. Epstein hopes to receive, the Agreement clearly indicates 
that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated. In addition to the terms of the Agreement, the Florida 
Department of Corrections does not allow persons who are registered sex offenders to participate in 
"community release" (which includes "work release). Since Mr. Epstein will have to register as a 
sex offender promptly after his guilty plea and sentencing, he will not be eligible for such a program. 
Thus, the U.S. Attorney's Office is simply putting you on notice that it intends to make certain that 
Mr. Epstein is "treated no better and no worse than anyone else convicted of the same offense. If 
Mr. Epstein is somehow allowed to participate in a work release program despite the Department of 
Corrections' rules and practices, the Office intends to investigate the reasons why an exception was 
granted in Mr. Epstein's case. 
Finally, as to the matters related to contacting the victims and the civil litigation, let me 
address your issues in turn. First, one of the material terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement was 
Mr. Epstein's agreement to waive the right to contest the "veracity" of the victims' claims. Second, 
the questions put to the victims who have already been contacted did not address the "veracity" of 
their claims. Instead, they were told that the investigators' questions were limited to whether they 
had been contacted by any law enforcement officers and told that there would be a civil settlement 
Third, the Non-Prosecution Agreement did not anticipate such a lengthy delay in the selection of an 
attorney representative, and the victims would have been "represented parties" without such delay, 
thus, the use of the phrase "may contact" meant "has permission to contact" That issue will soon be 
moot, because Judge Davis intends to name the attorney representative shortly. Upon the naming of 
that person, I will contact counsel and ask him to contact you after conferring with the victims. In 
the meantime, please treat all of the victims as represented parties who must be contacted only 
through their counsel. 
Your concerns regarding the Section 2255 litigation are unfounded. As you know, Mr. 
Ocariz had been told that he would be the attorney representative for the victims. As a matter of 
professional courtesy, he was informed that the Office decided to use a Special Master in the 
selection of the attorney representative. His decision to contact 
to express his interest in 
continuing to work on the case was no more "lobbying" than contacts made by your colleagues to 
to persuade him to select your choice of an attorney and to persuade him that the non-
prosecution agreement's terms did not contemplate litigation. You state that you are concerned that 
the Office has continued to insist that a primary criteria for the appointment of counsel is the ability 
to handle litigation against Mr. Epstein, yet your continued reference to challenging the "veracity" of 
the victims' claims, your contacting of victims whom you knew were soon to be represented, your 
attempts to muzzle the Office's and the FBI's abilities to comply with victim notification rules, and 
your client's consistent attacks upon the victims in the press all confirm the need for appointed 
counsel to be prepared for such litigation.
