D. The "Prime Rate" is determined once with respect to each billing period, and applies to the entire billing period. The Prime Rate 
for billing periods ending in any calendar month is the highest Prime Rate published in the Money Rates section (or successor 
section) of The Wall Street Journal on the 1st or 25th day (or, in each case, if such date is not a business day, the next business 
day) of the prior calendar month. If The Wall Street Journal ceases publication or does not publish the Prime Rate on ether of 
those dates, we may refer to the Prime Rate published in any other newspaper of general circulation in New York, New York, or we 
may substitute a similar reference rate at our sole discretion. 
E. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the DPR (and corresponding APR) on all balances will Increase to the Default Rate if during the 
Review Period (I) payment of your Minimum Amount Due is not credited to your Account by the Payment Due Date in any two 
billing periods, (ii) a payment on your Account is not honored by your bank or other financial institution, or (iii) you exceed any 
designated credit limit on your Account three or more times. The "Review Period" is the period, constituting approximately one 
year, of twelve consecutive billing periods ending with the Closing Date of the current biting period, whether or not you received a 
statement for each such billing period. If the Default Rate is rippled, it will apply to your Account for a minimum of twelve 
consecutive billing periods, beginning with the current billing period. The Default Rate Is a OPR which corresponds to an APR 
equal to the Prime Rate plus 21.99%." 
Monthly Payment-Minimum Amount Due (Effective with billing periods ending In June 2004) 
We are changing the calculation of the Minimum Amount Due on your Account. In some cases, as described below, we will increase the 
MINIM= Amount Due by $15. Accordingly, we are replacing the third paragraph of your Agreement entitled Billing Statements/Minimum 
Amount Due with the following: 
'Each billing statement will reflect a Minimum Amount Due. Payment is due by the time and date shown and in the manner 
prescribed on the statement. To calculate the Minimum Amount Due we will add together the following: 
(1) any amount past due; 
(2) the greatest of: 
a) 
1/50th of the New Balance on the Closing Date of the bllkng statement (the calculation of which is rounded 
to the nearest whole dollar) (for purposes of this calculation we exclude from the New Balance any over-emit 
fee added to your Account during the billing period), 
b) 
the current billed Finance Charges, or 
e) 
$15 (or the New Balance if it is less than $15); and 
(3) any over-limit fee added to your Account during the biting period. 
If the greatest of the three calculations in section (2) above is the current billed Finance Charges, then we will add $15to the 
calculation of the Minimum Amount Due. At our option, we may also include in the Minimum Amount Due all or part of other fees 
incurred during the takrig period and any part of the New Balance in excess of your credit line. 
The Minimum Amount Due will not exceed the New Balance. You may pay more than the Minimum Amount Due, up to the entire 
outstanding balance, at any time'
