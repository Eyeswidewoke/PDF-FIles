It doesnt exist in a physical sense but either=does conciousness. which it appears to me as an 
evolutionary a=vantage and provides the brain with rules memories. ( cu=ture again ) . and constraints. . tribes 
when att=cked , act like a self . . compete like selves. etc. Th= world we call physical . follows rules that we have 
created, most u=knowingly. 
I assume language acts like an effective tr=nsmittier. . some language like adrenaline. 
some=like dopamine. . do some extent the hormones of the cul=ure. ?
