careful. I know what Justice Department policy is. Any report will be, in my judgment, not one 
that is covered by the policy and would disrupt the election." 
McEnany: Democrats' Criticism Of Barr Is Rooted In His Probe Of "Russia-gate." 
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News' Fox & Friends (7/28, 831K), 
"The real problem that Democrats have with Attorney General Barr is he's actually taking 
Russia-gate seriously, this bogus sham effort that was launched against President Trump when 
he was just a candidate and went into his Administration. The fact that Bill Barr is looking into 
why Obama Administration spied on Trump campaign is their real problem." 
Barn "Possible" Pelosi's Comments Put Law Enforcement In Danger. Politico 
(7/28, Forgey, 4.29M) reports "Barr on Tuesday accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) 
of potentially endangering America's law enforcement community by likening the federal 
officers occupying Portland, Ore., to the 'stormtroopers' of Nazi Germany." Asked "whether 
Pelosi's comparison "encourages the violence that we're seeing" and 'participation against the 
police' at anti-racism protests," Barr Replied, "I think that's possible, and I think it's 
irresponsible to call these federal law enforcement officers Istormtroopers.'" 
Pelosi: Barr "Despicable." Pelosi said on MSNBC The BeatVi (7/28, 1.44M) that Barr's 
testimony "demonstrated to the American people the contempt that he has for our democracy. 
... I just thought he was despicable and so beneath the dignity of an Attorney General." Pelosi 
added that Barr "is there to support the President, Donald Trump, no matter what. He's not the 
President's lawyer. ... He is the Attorney General of the United States of America. Too bad he 
doesn't care or realize that." 
Richmond Accuses Barr, Sessions, Whitaker Of Racism. ABC World News TonightVi 
(7/28, story 4, 3:00, Muir, 7.32M) reported that during his testimony, Barr said he" had paid his 
respects to the late Rep. John Lewis." ABC added that "later, Congressman Cedric Richmond [D-
LA] had this to say." Richmond was shown saying, "The one thing that you have in common 
with your two predecessors, both Attorney General Sessions and Attorney General Whitaker, is 
that when you all came here and brought your top staff, you brought no black people. That, sir, 
is systematic racism. That is exactly what John Lewis spent his life fighting. And so, I would just 
suggest that actions speak louder than words. And, you should really keep the name of the 
honorable John Lewis out of the Department of Justice's mouth." 
Pence Criticizes Democrats, Says Violence "Has Got To Stop." Vice President 
Pence said on Fox News The StoryY (7/28), "It was clear that the Democrats on the 
Committee wanted to be heard more than they wanted to listen. Bill Barr is leading the Justice 
Department in this country with great integrity. ... It was clear that the Democrats wanted to 
hear themselves talk more than they wanted to hear from the Attorney General of the United 
States." Pence also said on Fox News The StoryY (7/28), "The violence in Portland has got to 
stop." The President "has made it clear, we will have law and order in our streets. With Joe 
Biden and the radical Democrats, they want to defund the police. While what we are going to do 
is find a law enforcement, stand up for 'law & order' and that begins right in Portland." Pence 
also said, "The reality is that the Mayor of Portland and the local community has allowed violent 
protesters to overrun that community. That community was looking the other way on groups 
like Antifa a long time ago, and now they are paying a price." 
Jordan Airs Video Of Violent Protests And Media Calling Them "Peaceful." 
Townhall (7/28, O'Brien, 177K) reports Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) "asked for a video to be shown" 
at hearing. The videoY "began with clips of different media outlets referring to the riots we've 
seen these past few months as 'peaceful protests," then "cut to a presser about the death of 
retired black police captain David Dorn, who was killed during a riot in St. Louis as he was 
helping protect a local business." The video "proceeded to show other footage of rioters toppling 
statues, looting local businesses, and running over police officers. It was scary, scary stuff." 
Townhall "included the video here but be warned it does have some graphic and disturbing 
footage."
