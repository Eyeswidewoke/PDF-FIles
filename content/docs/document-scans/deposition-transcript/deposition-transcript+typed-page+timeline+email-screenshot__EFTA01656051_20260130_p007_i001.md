FBI Daily News Briefing 
near World Turner's home, in south Wagner. Wagner, the largest city by population in Charles Mix County, is a part 
of the Yankton Sioux Reservation. The article quoted a spokeswoman for the FBI's Minneapolis field office, who 
said, "We are aware of the situation and investigating, as the investigation is ongoing, I have no further information 
to share at this time." 
FBI Investigating Financial Firm in Indiana 
WRTV (ABC-6) (09/03, Kenney) reported that the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation into Drive Planning LLC, 
a financial firm with offices in Indiana, Florida, and Georgia. According to the article, the SEC has a civil lawsuit 
against the Georgia-based financial company and its CEO for allegedly running a $300 million Ponzi 
scheme. Tuesday, the FBI's Atlanta office announced on social media it is conducting its own investigation into 
Drive Planning LLC. The article quoted the FBI, which said, "FBI Atlanta is seeking investors in Drive Planning LLC 
based in Alpharetta, the FBI currently has an investigation underway." The FBI is asking potential victims to fill out a 
form on their website. 
FBI, State and Local Police Renew Push to Solve 1981 New York Cold Case 
News 12 Westchester (09/03, Gomez) reported that members of the FBI were recently seen with local and state 
law enforcement during renewed efforts to solve an Orange County cold case from 43 years ago. The article stated 
that officials say they were handing out flyers asking drivers for information about the 1981 murder of 20-year-old 
Dawn Marino, from Unionville. Marnio was last seen in Pine Island after a night out at several bars with friends. 
She vanished while waiting outside Rinky Dinks on Route 1 for a ride from a friend. Her body was found six years 
later by a hunter in a nearby cistern on Halloween. 
Accused Pedophile Allegedly Filmed Kids at Disney World to Create Al Child Abuse Images 
The New York Post (09/03, Crane) reported that an alleged pedophile has been accused of using a GoPro to film 
kids at Disney World so he could create thousands of artificial intelligence child abuse images to spread on the dark 
web. Justin Ryan Culmo allegedly admitted to recording his underage victims at the Orlando, Fla., theme park and 
at least one middle school in recent years. The article noted that Culmo allegedly used the Al model Stable 
Diffusion to turn the footage into realistic images depicting child abuse, and then fired them off online under the 
screen names "Avalanche" and "TheRealAvalanche,". He was eventually tracked down after investigators identified 
one of his alleged victims and managed to trace the manipulated images back to him, the FBI said. The article 
mentioned that when he was nabbed, law enforcement found a trove of child abuse images on his devices and five 
spy cameras in a locked drawer in his desk, the report said. The suspect, who was busted late last year, has been 
indicted on a slew of child exploitation crimes, including abusing his two daughters, secretly recording minors and 
distributing child sexual abuse imagery online. 
Book: Inside the Bitter Personal Battle Between Top FBI and DOJ Officials Over Mar-A-Lago 
NBC News (09/03, Rohde) reported that in his four years as president and three years as ex-president, Donald 
Trump has successfully used conspiracy theories, co-option, and threats to bend DOJ and FBI officials to his will. 
Trump supporters say he has been victimized by both agencies. The article is adapted from the book "Where 
Tyranny Begins: The Justice Department, the FBI, and the War on Democracy," by NBC News' national security 
editor David Rohde. The article stated that one former senior DOJ official said that Trump's goal regarding the Dal 
and FBI has been clear during and after his presidency. According to the article, Trump supporters denied this and 
said the former president has been unfairly charged by DOJ and FBI officials in the classified documents case and in 
the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. Current and former DOJ and FBI officials dismissed those claims. They 
said Trump has been treated fairly by the Dal and FBI and, if anything, received more deference than other 
defendants. Experts said that Trump, to a greater extent than any other president in U.S. history, has successfully 
discredited the DOJ and FBI in the eyes of large groups of American voters. In an age of hyperpartisanship, it has 
proved impossible for the country's most powerful federal law enforcement agencies to criminally investigate 
Trump or Joe Biden — and maintain broad public support.
