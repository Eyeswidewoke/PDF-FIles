jurisdiction only, provided that he or she is able and willing to serve in such jurisdiction. If no 
Executor or successor Executor is able and willing to serve in such jurisdiction, my Executor shall 
designate a successor Executor to serve in such jurisdiction. Such designation shall be made by 
written instrument delivered to such successor Executor. 
B. 
No bond or other security shall be required of any Executor 
in any jurisdiction. 
C. 
Any Executor may resign in the manner provided for by the 
governing statutes of the state or territory having jurisdiction of the administration of my estate or 
in the absence of such statutory guidance, by filing a written notice of resignation with the Court 
having jurisdiction of the administration of my estate. Any Executor who resigns shall not be 
entitled to any compensation hereunder for any services rendered as Executor prior to his or her 
resignation. 
D. 
My Executor shall not be accountable or responsible to any 
person interested in my estate for the manner in which my Executor in good faith exercises or 
declines to exercise any discretionary authority or power of my Executor. My Executor shall not be 
liable for any loss or depreciation in value occasioned by reason of any negligence, error or mistake 
of judgment in entering into any transaction, in making any sale or investment, in continuing to 
hold any property or by reason of any action or omission, whether by my Executor or any other 
fiduciary, unless my Executor has acted in bad faith. In the absence of proof by affirmative 
evidence to the contrary, each Executor shall be deemed to have acted within the scope of my 
Executor's authority, to have exercised reasonable carc, diligence and prudence and to have acted 
impartially as to all interested persons. An Executor shall not be liable for the acts or defaults of 
another Executor.

my estate. My Executor has the power to do everything my Executor in good faith deems advisable 
without necessity of any judicial authorization or approval, even though but for this power it would 
not be authorized or appropriate for fiduciaries under any statutory or other rule of law. My 
Executor shall exercise my Executor's best judgment and discretion for what my Executor believes 
to be in the best interests of the beneficiaries hereunder. Except as otherwise specifically provided 
in this Will, if two Executors are empowered to participate in the decision to exercise or not to 
exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law, such decision shall be made by such 
Executors acting unanimously. If more than two Executors arc empowered to participate in the 
decision to exercise or not exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law, a majority of 
such Executors shall be empowered to make such decision. 
B. 
Except as otherwise provided herein, my Executor shall have 
the power:

to enter upon and take possession of the 
assets of my estate and collect the income and profits from such assets, and to invest and reinvest 
such assets in real, personal or mixed assets (including the common trust fluids of a corporate
