Information on Pay Over Time 
There Is no preset spending limit on your Card 
No pre-set spending limit does not mean unlimited spending. Purchasing power adjusts with your use of the Card, 
your payment history, credit record and financial resources known to us and other factors. Unless you have been 
previously notified otherwise, your Card has no preset spending limit. 
Your Pay Over Time Limit is $35,000.00 
We may approve or decline a charge regardless of whether your Card account balance exceeds or does not exceed 
your Pay Over Time limit. You must pay in full all charges that are not placed into a Pay Over Time balance. For more 
information about Pay Over Time features please visit arnericanexprins.com/payovertimit. 
You are currently enrolled in Pay Over Time Select 
You can select eligible charges to move into your Pay Over Time balance. Each month you simply choose whether to 
pay in full, pay the minimum due, or pay any amount in between. Interest applies from the date you add a charge to 
your Pay Over Time balance until the date it is paid. 
Renewal Notice 
Your Account renews next month. The following terms will be in effect when your Account renews, unless we tell 
you otherwise. Please refer to Page 2 for more information about your Account, including How We Cakutate Your 
Balance and Paying Interest. 
Payment Information: All charges made on this charge card, that are not included in a Pay Over Time balance, are 
due and payable by the Payment Due Date. 
Annual Membership Fee: The annual membership fee for your Account Is $2,500.00. When you receive the 
statement in which the annual fee is billed, you can avoid paying the annual fee by calling the Customer Care phone 
number on Page 2 to cancel your Account. 
APR Information: The Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) for each billing period may vary based on the Prime Rate. 
We use the Prime Rate published in the rates section of The Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date of the billing 
period. The Wall Street Journal may not publish the Prime Rate on that day. If it does not, we will use the Prime Rate 
from the previous day it was published. 
The Penalty APR may apply to a Feature if you make one or more late payments or if your payment is returned. We 
may also consider your creditworthiness in determining whether or not to apply the penalty APR to the Pay Over 
Time feature(S) on your Account. If the Penalty APR is applied, it will apply for at least 6 months. We will review your 
Account every 6 months after the Penalty APR is applied. The Penalty APR will continue to apply until you have 
made timely payments with no returned payments during the 6 months being reviewed. 
Please refer to page 2
