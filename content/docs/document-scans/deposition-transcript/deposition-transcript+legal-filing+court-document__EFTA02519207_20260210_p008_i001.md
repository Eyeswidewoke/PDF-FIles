Dear Mr= Aldhous, 
However, I am unavailable tomorrow (Monday) because of prior 
comm=tments until approximately 7:45 PM. 
Next, you should know that I'm not an em=loyee of CFI nor do I have any 
authority to speak on behalf of CFI. I40=804om writing to you from my personal email account in part to 
underscore=that point. I do retain a CFI email address in part as a courtesy to me an= in part because it serves a business 
purpose (for example, I still receiv= occasional emails addressed to the president of the organization).=/span> 
Turning to the s=bstance of your allegations, first you should be aware that I 
take the iss=e of sexual harassment very seriously. This is confirmed by the fact that =fter I was hired by CFI as its in-
house lawyer (a position I held prior to=becoming president and CEO) I insisted that the organization adopt a 
compr=hensive zero-tolerance harassment policy covering workplace harassment. Mo=eover, during the time I was 
president and CEO we had three separate state=trainings for the entire staff on sexual harassment issues. In addition, 
w=ere necessary, we did not hesitate to expend significant resources, includ=ng retaining outside investigators, to 
conduct serious, detailed inquiries=into harassment claims. One such inquiry cost the organization over $40,00=. 
Therefore, any suggestion that I do not personally take harassment claim= seriously is amply disconfirmed by my record. 
Regarding the alleged incident on t=e 2011 cruise, the first I became aware of it 
was when Pat Beauchamp, CFI=E2.4>s business manager and the employee responsible for cruise logisti=s, wrote to 
me in 2013 indicating she objected to inviting Lawrence Krauss=on our upcoming Galapagos cruise. I found this strange, 
and I responded to=her almost immediately asking the reasons for her objection. She gave two =easons. The first was 
that Krauss did not pay sufficient attention to the =uests on the 2011 cruise. I had heard this concern from one guest 
myself; =n the other hand, I also heard from several guests that they thought Kraus='s presentations were excellent and 
a highlight of the cruise. Acc=rdingly, I did not give this concern much weight. 
<=ont>The second reason was that Krauss had allegedly asked a female guest o= 
the cruise to join him and his partner, apparently for some sort of sexua= activity (I cannot recall whether Krauss was 
engaged or married or just s=riously involved with his female companion at the time, although they were=clearly 
romantically involved and seemed very much in love). This is the f=rst I had heard of this proposition. No complaint by 
the guest or anyone e=se had been made to me at the time of the cruise, although I was on the cr=ise and clearly visible 
throughout the cruise. 
I asked Ms. Beauchamp for contact i=formation for this guest. I did call the guest 
and she substantially confi=med what Ms. Beauchamp had said. I apologized on behalf of the organizatio=. The guest 
indicated although she was taken aback by Krauss's pro=osition at the time, she did not want to pursue the matter 
further. I then=got in contact with Krauss. Krauss denied the allegation. In light of the =uest's reluctance to pursue the 
matter and Krauss's own de=ial and, importantly, because between the time of the 2011 cruise and the =alapagos cruise 
we had instituted a policy regarding harassment at any </=pan>CFI event, which covers not just employees, but 
speakers and attendees= I decided to go ahead with my plan and have Krauss as a speaker on the Ga=apagos cruise. 
Krauss was fully aware of our harassment policy regarding C=I events because we had had a discussion about it. 
Therefore, I expected h=m to comply with that policy on the Galapagos cruise. As far as I know he =id, because we 
received no complaints about his conduct. Nor have we recei=ed any complaints about his conduct at other events. 
Let me just take a moment to hi=hlight the 2012 policy, which you can find in 
full here,

along with the announcement I made e=plaining the rationale for the policy. This policy was, certainly at its t=me, 
arguably the strongest any nonprofit organization had regarding conduc= at its events. Again, this policy shows that any
