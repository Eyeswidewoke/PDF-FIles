Trial of Music Teacher Accused of Sexual Abuse Stirs Painful Memories 
The New York Times (03/03, Wilson) reported that the criminal trial of Paul Geer, a former music teacher, played 
out in federal court in Albany, N.Y., last week. But testimony and photographic evidence transported everyone back 
to the 1990s and early 2000s to a town 125 miles away, Hancock, and to the Family Foundation School's secluded 
campus in the woods. The reform school is long closed and has settled several lawsuits by former students accusing 
Geer of sexual abuse over decades. But the trial brought the place back into the public spotlight. The article stated 
that Geer, who taught at the school from the early '90s until it closed in 2014, was the "father" of Family Six. He 
openly described himself to students as a sex addict who hit rock bottom while driving one day and nearly crashing 
as he masturbated, former students testified. "This constant, returning story; Steve Zahoroiko, 43, a former 
student and, later, a marine, testified. "That was the shining moment in his life, when he turned everything 
around." The article noted that defense lawyers have raised inconsistencies in the students' versions of events over 
the years, in FBI interviews and elsewhere. Elizabeth lanelli, a former student and an organizer of the earliest public 
attacks against the school, wrote a memoir of her time there, "I See You, Survivor," published in 2023. But she was 
called as a witness for the defense on Wednesday, and lawyers raised contradictions between what she had written 
and what she testified. 
Old-Fashioned Train Heists Yield Modern-Day Loot: Nike Air Jordans 
The New York Times (03/03, Levenson) reported that in recent months, well-organized bandits have jumped on 
trains rolling through the Mojave Desert in Arizona and stolen their cargo. But these robbers were not stealing gold 
bullion and pocket watches. They were taking Nike Air Jordans, wireless gaming headsets and other modern-day 
loot, according to federal prosecutors. The article added that in many cases, the robbers used electric saws, bolt-
cutters and other tools to break open the locks on containers holding pricey merchandise. Then they cut the air 
hoses on the brakes, which caused the trains to come to a sudden stop and put them at risk of derailing, 
prosecutors said. Trains in the region often travel at 70 m.p.h. Once the trains were stopped, the robbers took cases 
of Air Jordans, electronics and other goods off the trains and hid them in fields and brush by the side of the tracks. 
Then they contacted associates who came to pick up the goods and hauled them away in box trucks, prosecutors 
said. The train heists, previously reported by The Los Angeles Times, have increased in frequency over the past two 
years, as more transnational gangs have been targeting high-value shipments. The article noted that at least 12 
defendants — most of them Mexican citizens who were in the United States illegally — have been charged in 
federal courts since last year, according to court documents that describe at least seven train robberies since June 
8, 2023. Law enforcement agents have seized about $3 million in merchandise believed to have been stolen from 
BNSF trains.

Defense Secretary Hegseth Orders Suspension of Pentagon's Offensive Cyberoperations Against Russia 
The Associated Press (03/03, Baldor, Klepper) reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the 
suspension of the Pentagon's offensive cyberoperations against Russia. According to the article, the decision does 
not affect cyberoperations conducted by other agencies, such as the CIA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, but the Trump administration also has rolled back other efforts at the FBI and other agencies 
related to countering digital and cyber threats. Additionally, Attorney General Pam Bondi has disbanded an FBI task 
force focused on foreign influence campaigns, like those Russia used to target U.S. elections in the past. The article 
noted that the move has been criticized by national security experts, who argue that the U.S. should expand its 
cyber capabilities to counter threats from Russia and other adversaries. Fox News (03/03, Miller) reported that 
Hegseth responded to an attack from Hillary Clinton with a photo of her holding a "reset" button with Russian 
Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov in 2009. The photo was seen over 2 million times and was praised by 
conservatives on social media, with many saying Clinton got "owned" by Hegseth's response. The article explained 
that Clinton had initially criticized Hegseth over a report that he ordered Cyber Command to "stand down" on all 
Russia operations, prompting Hegseth's retaliatory post. Additional reporting on the story was provided by BBC 
(03/03, FitzGerald), CBS News (03/03, LaPorta, D'Agata, et al.), The National Desk (03/03, Denean), Axios (03/03, 
Lotz), MSNBC (03/03, Benen), Newsweek (03/03, Cole), Politico (03/03, Miller, Roussi), and Telegraph (03/03, 
Millward, Makoli).
