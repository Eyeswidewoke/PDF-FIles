The Designer Who Liked Models - New York Times

the emergence of two more victims in the days following the arrest, who recounted the same pattern of 
behavior, including a 15-year-old whom Mr. Jon met on March 3, the night before the lingerie model 
arrived. 
And as the police contacted other women in the designer's life, more accusers came forward, with 
remarkably similar stories, going back to 2002. The district attorney filed an amended complaint on 
March 19, adding 4 more victims and 13 new charges: forcible rape, sexual penetration by a foreign 
object, sexual exploitation of a child, sexual battery, forcible oral copulation. 
As this indictment began to hit the headlines, still more accusers emerged, for a total of 12 named in the 
court papers, one of them age 14 and another 17. None was older than 23; and each aspired to be a 
model. 
"This was a revolving door," Ms. Robison said. "The m.o.is similar. He allegedly met them over the 
Internet, promised to pay for a trip out here or sent them a plane ticket. And once they got out here, he 
used his position in the fashion industry to take advantage of them. And he allegedly told them if they 
said they were not comfortable: 'Get used to it. This is what happens in the industry.' " 
Mr. Richards sneers at the naiveté of all this. "I have girls who claim they were assaulted by my client 
and days later sent photos to be in his shows," he said. "It's strange. Is he being tried for capitalizing on 
women who are willingly sexual with him to get ahead, if he did that at all? All of these women have 
some twisted story." 
One story sounds twisted indeed, if not in the way Mr. Richards means. The father of a 19-year-old 
college student in Texas said that Mr. Jon contacted his daughter through her MySpace page in 2005, 
when she was in high school, and told her she had the fresh look he was seeking in a model. 
Mr. Jon soon flew to Dallas, where the father picked him up at the airport, and with the girl's mother, a 
child psychologist, grilled the designer about his intentions. 
"We said, 'We're worried about this industry; " said the father, who came to Los Angeles with his 
daughter last week to speak to the district attorney's office. (At the father's request, he was put in touch 
with a reporter by prosecutors. The father's identity is being withheld to protect his daughter.) 
Mr. Jon told the girl's parents, the father said, "I treasure the feminine being. I got all this spirituality 
from my grandmother and my mom." 
But a few hours later, he forced the teenager to have oral sex at the hotel where he was staying, the 
father said. "I drove him to the hotel, where he raped my daughter," he said ruefully. 
Last November the young woman finally told her parents of this and other alleged assaults by Mr. Jon, 
and they first approached the authorities, the father said. Prosecutors in Los Angeles, who first heard the 
story last week, have not charged the designer in this case. 
It wasn't supposed to roll this way for Anand Jon Alexander, his full name used in court papers, who 
after years of false starts had finally seemed on the brink of establishing himself. 
The child of a well-to-do family from South India, he arrived in this country as a teenager, coming of 
age in the hard-partying clubs of Miami in the 1990s. Mr. Jon cites a friendship with the designer Gianni 
Versace as one of his earliest breaks, and he studied at the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, before
