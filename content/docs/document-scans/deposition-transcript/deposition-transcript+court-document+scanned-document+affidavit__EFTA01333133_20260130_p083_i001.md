(Continued) 
10, 2006, at approximately 2:30 p.m., I served...Oat her residence in 
The subpoena was given to her mother, OM 
I learned through one of the victims es that she was personally 
contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein. 
The source assured 
she would receive monetary compensation for her 
assistance in not cooperating with law enforcement. allpslso stated 
she was told, "Those who help him will be compensated and those who 
hurt him will be dealt with." I toldfathat tampering with a 
witness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious. I asked her 
who approached her during this encounter. MMIlloriginally was reluctant 
to provide the name of the person who approached her to offer her not 
to testify because she felt they were still friends. 
On April 11, 2006, Det 
and I traveled to Tallahassee, Florida 
and met with the victim, 
es identified Se 
N/R, 
as the person w o approached her in Royal Palm Beach while 
I lea
lhite during Spring Break in March 2006. —also 
stated she 
did not want to pursue the intimidation charges on anal 
_was 
concerned that the defense attorney was given a copy of the report as 
certain things she had told me in confidence were repeated to her by 
Beal. Prior to our departure, the victim was given a copy of her 
subpoena for the Grand Jury which was scheduled to commence April 18, 
2006. 
Upon our return from Tallahassee, I notified the State Attorney's 
Office of what was told to me. I also notified them that the 
subpoenas were delivered to the witnesses and they would be calling 
for arrangements for the date and time needed for the Grand Jury. I 
spoke with ASA 
and informed her of the possible intimidation by 
the defense. 
On April 13, and April 14, 2006 I attempted contact on several 
occasions with ASA 
and ASA 
to ascertain when the 
victims needed to report for Grand Jury testimony. Messages were left 
on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, duriiiiiie hours of 9:00 am 
and 11:30 am, I again left messages for ASA 
and ASA 
for either of them to return my call as I had not heard from the State 
Attorney's Office as to the time and date of the Grand Jury. 
At approxim 
12:30 pm, I went to the State Attorney's Office and 
located ASA. 
and ASA 
in their offices. I entered ASA 
's office who informed me that she was going to return my 
call. She explained that an offer was made to the defense, Atty Guy 
Fronstin and Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg 
Assault with intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with 
adjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to 
psychiatric/sexual evaluation and no unsupervise 
'th minors. 
When asked about the all the other victims, ASA 
ated 
that was the only offer made as to one victim,fl ASA 
cell phone rang and went to voice mail. She checked her voice mail 
and played the message on speaker. The caller identified himself as
