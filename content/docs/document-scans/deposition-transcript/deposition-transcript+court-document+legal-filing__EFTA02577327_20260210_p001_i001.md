Re: The benefits of deception 
deception and self- deception , need better definitions= The recent work suggests that denial. is localized in the brain. 
A=restrictor of harmful information.- when knocked out. deception inc=eases. i.e. knowing death is within 100 years. 
is a knock out. a def=ct in the restrictor seems to increase the likelihood of depression.

Kevin, thank you for your excellent input an= inspired questions on this topic! 
> The broad idea is that we'll need to build slack into systems of u=iquitous computing. That there's a paradox in 
that in order to have a =ohesive identity, certain aspects of our lives require omission (or e.g., =eception). 
There are two sides to this: first of all, many of our interaction partners=may have difficulties to accept (or even 
comprehend) the interactions and =ocial norms that we maintain in other contexts (think: living in a small t=wn in the 
midwest vs visiting Burning Man; religious community vs. less us=al sexual interests; family life vs. work life; 
organizational role vs. fr=endships). As a result, we compartmentalize our social expression. In a cu=turally 
inhomogeneous society, this kind of deception (in the sense of hid=ng parts of my personality depending on the context) 
is a prerequisite of =eaningful freedom. 
But on a deeper level: while we may maintain the illusion of a coherent sel=, we do not possess a single social 
persona. Our social identity emerges n=t only over our personality, but also over the individual relationships in=which it 
manifests. We become who we are through the reflection of others.=br> 
> The ethnographer Tricia Wang coined "The Elastic Self" after=spending a lot of time with Chinese and 
American youth using various forms=of social software (...) 
The notion of the "Elastic Self" might capture both aspects. On o=e hand, we may explore different possible 
ways of self-actualization by ke=ping social contexts isolated from each other, on the other, we usually ma=ntain more 
than one persona. 
> How would you build a system that provides a patient with the ability =o continue acting deceptively -- in 
order to maintain a cohesive identity 
while providing the doctor with the ability to find -- and act on -- per=ect 
information? 
The simplest setup: the patient is a BDI (belief, desire, intention) agent,=and has accurate knowledge about 
himself. He also has beliefs what part ab=ut his beliefs, desires and intentions are acceptable to the outside 
world=(which here is a homogenous hospital context and does not need further dif=erentiation), and which ones need 
to be adapted to fit the actual intentio=s. For perfect information, the doctor gets direct access to both layers.<=r> 
The BDI model of agency (i.e. the idea of describing an agent using a set o= beliefs, desires and intentions) is a 
somewhat crude simplification. We m=y well hold different, contradictory sets of beliefs and goals at differen= levels, 
and the one that becomes relevant depends on the context, and the=state the agent is in. Also, many beliefs and 
intentions are not directly =epresented, but generated when needed, and their content and form may be h=ghly
