"between who he is and what he is focusing on versus the 
partisan impeachment underway in the House." 
Senate Republicans Divided Over How To Proceed 
With Impeachment Articles. The New York Times (11114, 
Hulse, 18.61M) reports some Senate Republicans are 
"arguing for a speedy vote" on impeachment articles, which 
are expected to come from the House, while others see "an 
opportunity to drag out the historic proceedings and tie down 
some Democratic senators at a prime moment in their 
presidential campaigns." According to Republican senators, 
"the split over how to approach what is likely to be the first 
presidential impeachment trial ever to unfold in an election 
year has been on vivid display in their private weekly lunches 
in the Capitol." 
Trump Dismisses Impeachment "Hoax," Will 
Release Transcript Of First Zelensky Call. 
Politico (11/13, Forgey, Okun, 4.29M) reports that at the 
White House yesterday alongside Turkish President Recep 
Tayyip Erdo'gan, President Trump "dismissed the House's 
impeachment proceedings as a 'hoax and said he was 'too 
busy to watch' — and then blasted Democrats' choice of 
questioners at a hearing he said he hadn't been briefed on." 
Trump is quoted as saying, "I'm sure I'll get a report. ... I have 
not been briefed, no. There's nothing there. I see they're 
using lawyers that are television lawyers. They took some 
guys off television. I'm not surprised to see it because Schiff 
can't do his own questions." The Washington Times (11/13, 
Boyer, 492K) says the comment "was an apparent reference 
to Democratic counsel Dan Goldman, who is conducting 
much of the questioning." Fox News (11/13, Re, 27.59M) also 
reports on its website that Trump slammed "the hearsay-
laden 'witch hunt" and said, "I'm going to be releasing, I think 
on Thursday, [another] transcript, which actually was the first 
of the two [phone calls with Ukraine's leader]." 
The AP (11/13, Colvin) casts Trump as "professing 
disinterest and disdain," but adds that "even as" he "tried to 
suggest that he was above the fray, the president repeatedly 
laid out his many grievances against the process playing out 
on the opposite end of Pennsylvania Avenue." Said Trump, "I 
hear it's a joke. I haven't watched for one minute. ... This is a 
sham, and it shouldn't be allowed." The Washington 
Examiner (11113, Dilly, 448K) reports that the White House 
has "been keen to portray an image of a president intent on 
delivering his promises to the American people, continuing to 
work on overhauling the healthcare system, striking a trade 
deal with China, and mulling further tax cuts even as 
Democrats pursue impeachment." However, the Examiner 
adds, "as a heavy consumer of TV news, White House 
watchers are keeping a close eye on Trump's Twitter feed to 
see how he reacts to the hearings." 
The Washington Times (11113, Munoz, 492K) reports 
that in advance of Wednesday's hearing, "the Trump 'war 
room' kicked off the defense" of the President, "releasing a 
video targeting House Speaker Nancy Pebsi." The video 
"threads together clips of the California Democrat toeing the 
line on impeachment, warning that it would be divisive for the 
country, before showing the stark party-line vote that 
formalized the impeachment inquiry." Also Wednesday, 
Trump tweeted a campaign ad 
with the caption, 
"DEMOCRATS 
ARE 
PUTTING 
POLITICS 
BEFORE 
COUNTRY!" 
NBC Nightly News (11/13, story 3, 2:00, Holt, 6.34M) 
described the President "and his White House [as] 
downplaying what they describe as a witch hunt, decrying it 
as boring, and disputing" witness William Taylor's claims in 
his testimony. Trump was shown saying, "I know nothing 
about that. First time I've heard it. ... I don't recall. No, not at 
all. Not even a little bit." The CBS Evening News (11/13, story 
3, 2:10, O'Donnell, 4.47M) further pointed out Trump "denied 
ever talking to EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about 
investigations in Ukraine." ABC World News Tonight (11/13, 
story 5, 1:25, Muir, 7.16M) showed Trump adding, "The one 
thing I've seen that Sondland said was that he did speak to 
me for a brief moment and I said, 'no quid pro quo under any 
circumstances,' and that's true. And the other, I've never 
heard this." The Hill (11/13, Chalfant, 2.98M) reports "Trump 
has aggressively pushed back against the inquiry, accusing 
Democrats of a partisan effort to damage his political 
prospects." He "has also taken aim at witnesses like Taylor, a 
member of his administration, accusing them of being 'Never 
Trumpers.'" 
ABC World News Tonight (11113, story 6, 0:40, Karl, 
7.16M) reported "the bottom line from the White House 
perspective is that nothing changed" Wednesday, as "House 
Democrats are still on the road to impeaching the President, 
but not a single Republican has shown any indication of 
breaking ranks. That means" that 'without significant, 
dramatic changes, there's no way the Senate would vote to 
remove the President, and his fate ultimately will be 
determined by voters next November." 
However, Politico (11/13, Orr, Cook, Kumar, 4.29M) 
says while White House aides "dismissed the landmark event 
as a tedious affair," the "attempt to project calm within the 
West Wing was belied throughout the morning by a cascade 
of combative email blasts, tweets and statements that flowed 
from Trump's outside allies and his campaign war room." 
John Roberts said on Fox News Special Report (11/13, 
1.53M), "The White House's rapid response organization was 
buzzing today, pushing back against every piece of evidence 
the Democrats extracted from their witnesses, criticizing 
Taylor for relying on hearsay and conjecture, some 17 times 
during his opening 
statement, 
insisting 
that" Kent 
"contradicted the Democrats' assertion that there was a quid 
pro quo." 
Politico (11113, Kumar, 4.29M) reports, however, that 
"frustrated allies are urging Trump to stop talking about 
himself and focus on his army of supporters." According to
