Leon, Congragul=tions on biting the bullet. at least 18 months =AO late , but I m encouraged and glad for you.. 
There i= a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 months. =he same work that i outlined in my email of 2 
years ago. ( you can h=ve it if you like ) . Brad wechsler is a dope.. sorry, =1 have been sayingt he same thing for a long 
time. he was a not a st=p up from eileen but a step sideways. in the begiging th=re was eileen and Tom and ralph 
lerner. all your picks. =C2 then brad. john, joe. and threee others that i nev=r met. . joslin was chosen from a list of 2 
peopi. each that w=uld be limited by a salary of 250k. 
He complained =or over a year , re his direction by eileen and 
ada , and then brad. =C2 He cracked after months and moths of warnings. though di=able he ran your office this year. 
with john and joe. He ran amok,=C2 and as i told you reminded me in most conversations that you t=ld him that he 
works for you and not for me and that brad needs to s=e everything becuase he pays him . 
I ha=e taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you carlyns name,=C2 no more . no follow up questions no 
interactionl (=that was eilleen _) but somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing.=C2 . 
when i told you that i thought 
eilee= wasnt up to the task, you yelled that i was talking out of both sides of =y mouth. . You told me this year, that 
by t=yhing to protect you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him=C2 and it was my responsiblity to do his work. it 
the= turns out that we didnt consider himpself fired,. and c=ntinued to make a really complex mess.. Joshn 
castrucci= was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no repsarsioity for him, i think you shouldbt hire 
him,  your respoins= was that was only beacuse i didnt trust him. last jan you tol= me he was gone. however he too 
is still there, an= a waste of money and space. 
=C2 
My time is complicated by donalds pote=tially visciating any reason to have the foreign funds repatriation 
=Ian that i had put together. . however as you are aware = have some pretty sever decisions to make re my time in the 
next year or t=o. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time=C2 and make any future plans to redo 
your procrastiantion produce= dilemmas. 
That being said , =AO the tasks at hand are the following. 
You have a ba=l of string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be c=refully unwound , even the 
subsitution of barry for your next =rustee, needs focus on procedure. THis is no easy task. . =AO org charts. books, 
balance sheets . trust valuations. are =11 a part. 
a re fresh of your estate plan FROM SCRA=CH. . clats , trust. partnerships. gra=s. Ilcs. bank accounts , filing 
requrements. etc. =C2 A long overdue review of the brh tra and shareholers agreement to se= how they fit into new 
plan. . XXXXX=C2 planning.. , airplane reddo. , buying another. . ? boat=sale, miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . 
three yea=s over due. . an accounting system. =AO fire john 
joslin stays for a year. or so. so does =om. Im not 
sure wechsler is smart enough to be a trustee, so i= would be nice if you had an alternative. I would love y=ur son josh 
to do it. if i can figure it out for tax purposes. =C2 Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize.=C2 cash flow 
reporting. cash mgmt. stock sales. sec i=s. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will t=ke months to review. . 
you CANNOT file unreviewed=C2 audited documents. . CANNOT> this w=ll be very detailed work. . all avoidable if 
the c=ll would have come to me , and we shut it down quickly. . =AO limiting it . or containing it. . . you will ne=d five 
new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly a= A player. I have great hope in Barry as you know. =He will 
need to be trained. this is an unknown for them moment. =AO time issues. After 4 years of telling you , that you =ould 
do better than Halperin, im glad that you believe barry =C2 I take no offense in fact I take comfort in the fact that 
afte= one conversation with barry you are now convinced- as long as it ha=pens..
