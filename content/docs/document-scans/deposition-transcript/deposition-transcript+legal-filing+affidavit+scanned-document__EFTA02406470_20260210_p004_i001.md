unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapon, we mean what we say. Let =escribe very specifically why this is 
important to us. 
In addition to the profound threat that it poses to Israel, one of our stro=gest allies in the world; in addition to the 
outrageous language that has =een directed toward Israel by the leaders of the Iranian government -- if =ran gets a 
nuclear weapon, this would run completely contrary to my policies of nonproliferation. The risk= of an Iranian nuclear 
weapon falling into the hands of terrorist organiza=ions are profound. It is almost certain that other players in the region 
w=uld feel it necessary to get their own nuclear weapons. So now you have the prospect of a nuclear arms race i= the 
most volatile region in the world, one that is rife with unstable gov=rnments and sectarian tensions. And it would also 
provide Iran the additio=al capability to sponsor and protect its proxies in carrying out terrorist attacks, because they are 
less fearf=l of retaliation. 
GOLDBERG: What would your position be if Israel weren't in this pict=re? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: It would still be a profound national-security inte=est of the United States to prevent Iran from 
getting a nuclear weapon. 
GOLDBERG: Why, then, is this issue so often seen as binary, always d=fined as Israel versus Iran? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think it has to do with a legitimate concern on t=e part of Israel that they are a small country in a 
tough neighborhood, an= as a consequence, even though the U.S. and Israel very much share assessm=nts of how 
quickly Iran could obtain breakout capacity, and even though there is constant consultation and inte=ligence 
coordination around that question, Israel feels more vulnerable. A=d I think the prime minister and the defense minister, 
[Ehud Barak,J feel = profound, historic obligation not to put Israel in a position where it cannot act decisively and 
unilate=ally to protect the state of Israel. I understand those concerns, and as a=consequence, I think it's not surprising 
that the way it gets framed, at I=ast in this country, where the vast majority of people are profoundly sympathetic to 
Israel's plight and =otential vulnerabilities -- that articles and stories get framed in terms =f Israel's potential 
vulnerability. But I want to make clear t=at when we travel around the world and make presentations about this issue, 
that's not how we frame it. We frame it as= this is something in the national-security interests of the United States=and 
in the interests of the world community. And I assure you that Europe =ould not have gone forward with sanctions on 
Iranian oil imports -- which are very difficult for them to c=rry out, because they get a lot of oil from Iran -- had it not 
been for th=ir understanding that it is in the world's interest, to prevent Iran from =etting a nuclear weapon. China 
would not have abided by the existing sanctions coming out of the National=Security Council, and other countries 
around the world would not have unif=ed around those sanctions, had it not been for us making the presentation =bout 
why this was important for everyone, not just one country. 
GOLDBERG: Is it possible that the prime minister of Israel has over-=earned the lessons of the Holocaust? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think the prime minister has a profound responsib=lity to protect the Israeli people in a hostile 
neighborhood, and I am cer=ain that the history of the Holocaust and of anti-Semitism and brutality d=rected against 
the Jewish people for more than a millennium weighs on him when he thinks about these questi=ns. I think it's 
important to recognize, though, that the prime mini=ter is also head of a modern state that is mindful of the profound 
costs o= any military action, and in our consultations with the Israeli government, I think they take those costs, and 
potential =nintended consequences, very seriously. 
GOLDBERG: Do you think Israel could cause damage to itself in Americ= by preempting the Iranian nuclear program 
militarily? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't know how it plays in America. I think we in=the United States instinctively sympathize with 
Israel, and I think politi=al support for Israel is bipartisan and powerful. In my discussions with I=rael, the key question 
that I ask is: How does this impact their own security environment? I've said it publ=cly and I say it privately: ultimately, 
the Israeli prime minister and the=defense minister and others in the government have to make their decisions=about 
what they think is best for Israel's security, and I don't presume to tell them what is best for them.=But as Israel's closest
