come up with oilers. That is how University of Texas at Austin got Weinberg and some others - they went on a mission to 
increase their profile by hiring a big shot. NYU is clearly trying to do that - hire a big shot name brand physicist as part of 
a move to upgrade their department. 
There might be some other department out there that doesn't know she might be available. However, just like putting a 
company "in play" can backfire with a suitor you don't want, or could screw up the deal with ones you do want, there arc 
some possible issues with letting everybody know. Perhaps the physics departments do already know she might be 
available. 
Second there is the salary issue. Without knowing more about the dynamics of the department. it is hard to say for sure. 
It probably does not hurt to ask for more money to a point, but past that point it could raise rancor in the department and 
ultimately be self defeating. Caltech is a much smaller institution than its reputation would suggest. and it is possible that 
they don't have any more resources. 
So those are some general considerations, but here is the real advice. 
Shc should accept Caltech. Depending on the details of the situation, maybe she could ask gently for a bit more money. 
However I think that is a small detail • she should basically take the otter. Here is why: 
• The reputation is perfectly OK. She has enough brand that it doesn't matter, but there is nothing wrong with Caltech . It 
is not a reputations' embarassment to go there. Yes, it is not as famous with the general public as Harvard. but that is 
small change compared to being unhappy at Harvard. 
• She likes the place - both the department and LA. That matters a lot. One can strategize all day long about how to make 
Harvard pay more to keep her, or get NYU to step up... but if she really likes Caltcch then that matters a lot. Asking a 
bunch of big-shot advisors like us to recommended a strategy is all well and good, but she has to live this out day by day 
for many years. She should go to the place that makes her happy. 
• It may be less money but with less teaching load she can make more money in other ways. She can write books more 
often (you'll like that part John). she can give paid speaking engagements, she potentially could consult for companies... I 
don't know the key numerical details of course, and perhaps the difference in salary is huge. However I suspect that it is 
not. Lisa has sufficient personal brand that I think she can very likely earn the difibrence if making some more money is 
really important. Indeed, less teaching time may well make the Caltech offer higher if you factor this sort of thing in... 
- However if making money is really important, then why be an academic in the first place? She chose an academic life 
and has been successful. Shc should go to the place that will make her happy.

Subject: RE: Lisa Randall 
John: with a board of advisors of this caliber, Lisa could be in REAL trouble!! 
I suspect the consensus would be for Cal Tech, because it's closer to where most of us live. I'm not sure about the 
negotiating/institutional dynamics though. I will give Lisa a call to discuss in any event. 
I'm sure she appreciates your efforts to help. n
