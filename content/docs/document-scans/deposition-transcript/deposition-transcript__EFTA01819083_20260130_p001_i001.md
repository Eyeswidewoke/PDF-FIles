e 'my ps em

of want to argue with you.. I don't consider 
worth talking about. I have no feelings for 
„ she is liked needed help, thats it no more. no less, . i have a monstrous amount of 
work in progress. I have asked for your help . . the garage is a pigstye. I am no further ahead 
with landscape lights, dock, statue base, the house has dog shit and piss,I have cleaned it up 
myself l , and not challenged you. I went through kitchen and house things without you , in an 
effort not to embarass you. especaillly in front of others. since before sarah left on her vacation. 
you wanted authoriity , no food, flowers, facial, helper, / i love you, and want you to be happy. I 
need help to reduce my workload, I think you should re read your emails to me. I asked you to 
set aside time to talk , you chose not to, . brice valdson, lynn and jojo, need to brought in to help 
, maybeMto try out. story to do local things. kichen doors, etc. As I have tried to explain , 
an agreement has two parties, you have chosen not to fulfill your part, it is your prerogative, 
besides making soups, which were great , as you followed the recipe, (a discipline that you abhor 
) , healthy snacks, low cholesterol, food, house projects , . I made a point not to argue, it has 
become silly I get angry, and nothing changes, therefore taking getting angry out of the equation 
seems to make sense, I have asked that you have a budget, it allows you to see what you spend 
and on what. it is also a reflection of what actually gets done. you have chosen not to do it. no 
problem.. I love you , so what am i to do? „ I need time to get my life in order , I would have 
hoped having you here would reduce my load ( not that load ). instead of adding stress and 
conflicts.

Did Mstay in the apartment or at the house after I left ? 
Do you realize it took years for me to get over the lies you told me regarding 
in the past 
(being in aspen, taking her to the alace oin to the movies with her..) 
I spent a lot of time talking to both 
about it. I used to get sick every time I 
looked at 
or even heard her name because it reminded me of those lies. It was not a 
secret to you or anybody else that I couldn't stand her. Now I was finally at a point where I 
could trust you not to do that again and I didn't mind having her around. But the moment I 
left, you did it again - despite an agreement she was to leave on monday, you decided to 
change her ticket at the last minute and not even tell me about it until the next day (when I 
already knew she never came). When I got to NY, she wasn't here and you were not 
answering your phones. 
You don't like being accused of deception yet you don't even care to explain how it is possible 
that this happened again...this is a tough one for me to ignore...THIS is a very irritated nipple
