Steve — I met with Sam last week to discuss his status with us. As you know he has been working / interning 
with the event dept coming in between and part and full time basis. When we spoke he expressed that while he 
appreciated learning about events from a sales perspective, he was really under the impression that working in 
events he would be working on "productions* ie: really coordinating — floral, linen, lighting, china etc — all of the 
large scale production I detail work — which is not what our special events team does. We do have some larger 
more production oriented events but the majority of our bread and butter is high volume event sales. I 
suggested to Sam that he attend the set up in Nov and Dec of some of these larger events to learn. Karin is 
sending him a schedule as they book to plan his attendance. Sam and I also discussed with Andy Kelly at 1920 
Bunker Club — setting up a trial for a gay night. We tentatively chose Sunday Dec. 4th. Sam was going to be 
looking into promoter costs via his friends that do this and is to be sending me a proposal for how the night 
would run. We discussed this being a one time trial for now and potentially a monthly Sunday night party. Sam 
was also looking into having it on the same night at a gay toys for tots event which is highly attended and this 
could be a good after party (his idea). Sam has also expressed interest in doing a night life trail with our nightlife 
operators and also with Wendy at Kibo (not set up yet). When I spoke with Sam he is very interested in nightlife 
and possibly event production but has still not left his dream of fashion styling behind. He seemed concemed 
that maybe he should try to focus on that more and not ready to let that go. 
As discussed maybe Sam should do a trail with Gigi on floral and styling next as an option. Sam is a great guy 
and we have loved having him around the office, he is very helpful and I know he was concerned he was a 
burden but NOT AT ALL. 
I will loop you into an emai from Sam about next steps with gay night so you can connect with him about 
supporting his negotiations.
