Ms. Taymor said she was talking over ideas fo= "Midsummer" with Es Devlin, the British set and costume 
de=igner who is known for big-budget spectacles like the closing ceremony for t=e London Olympic Games last summer. 
"Midsummer" will=not be set in any particular time or period, "but rather in its own=world," Ms. Taymor said. 
She did say that she may include children a=d teenagers in the cast, after recently holding a workshop of the play 
with=children "to play with their energy and physicality and to think ab=ut raw elemental energy." Ms. Taymor's long-
time partner, E=liot Goldenthal, will compose original music for "Midsummer."=br> 
"There is a visceral nature to the theater, and I want to ha=e that in the production," said Ms. Taymor, who has 
never directed a="Midsummer" before. She was a designer on the play in 1984 w=en Theater for a New Audience did a 
children's version — he= first collaboration with the company and its artistic director, Jeffrey Ho=owitz, who is now a 
close friend. 
The play will begin performances o= Oct. 19 in the theater's new 299-seat main stage space, which has b=en 
designed by architect Hugh Hardy. Opening night is set for Nov. 2. 
Asked if her return to New York theater was any more special because of he= experiences on "Spider-Man," Ms. 
Taymor simply said that s=e was looking forward to working on the play. 
"Spider-Man4o=8040 became the most talked-about Broadway show in many years because of a=nightmare's-
worth of creative and technical delays, cast injuries, a=d offstage showdowns between Ms. Taymor and her composers —
Bono an= the Edge of U2 — and the show's producers. 
Bono, Ed=e, and the producers ultimately replaced Ms. Taymor as the show's d=rector after more than three 
months of preview performances during the wint=r of 2011. The producers contended that she resisted their pleas to 
revamp 4)=804>Spider-Man" into a more family-friendly musical (thereby possi=ly selling more tickets and recovering 
its high costs), while Ms.Taymor sai= the producers refused to support her requests and ideas for changes in the=script 
and the score. 
"Spider-Man" opened in June 20=1 to mostly negative reviews but has gone on to become a popular show with 
t=urists, although ticket sales have cooled a bit in recent months. 
Ms= Taymor sued the producers in federal court in late 2011, saying they were p=ofiting from her "Spider-Man" 
script and staging and owed h=r more than $1 million in back pay and royalties; they counter sued, arguin= that she had 
been fired for breach of contract. The judge in the case anno=nced last August that the two sides had reached a 
settlement agreement in p=inciple, but since then the sides have not been able to come to terms

The specifics of their ongoing differences have never been d=sclosed; Ms. Taymor declined to comment on 
Wednesday about the issues holdi=g up a settlement, but said that a negotiated resolution was "looki=g good." 
"I'm hoping that we're goin= have a good outcome very soon," she said.
