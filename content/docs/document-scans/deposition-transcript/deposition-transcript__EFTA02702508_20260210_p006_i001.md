this grave—

mortality, mortality 
The writers then went on to talk about some of the poems. 
Images do a lot of work, especially in haiku, and I like 
to see movement in the haiku, so this one ("this gravel 
is my favorite—the one I felt so much movement from. 
This one taught me something, and it changed 
something. The speaker is in the image even 
though there is no "I." I even felt the image 
move. What I learned is that mortality is not 
just when the body goes, but when the person is no 
longer remembered. That's just so beautiful.

I see it differently. I like all these readings, and I'm a 
fan of this one too, even if we all read it a little differ-
ently. One way is that people don't see the end coming, 
because they are living their lives and here "mortality" 
is perking up and saying "don't forget about me"; or 
also that the writer's current life is like a grave—the daily 
routine, the getting and spending, and our day-to-day 
life is a kind of mortality. But this is because of the other 
poems pointing this way. 
-DC 
DC brought up "time of life issue" as one of his favorites. It 
was from of the original 2000 poems written in 2014. 
pleasure for me. The talon isn't mentioned, but you can 
see it; (DC agrees); it isn't mentioned, but you can see it. 
-CG 
MN said, "This is a great one? 
Next, DC brought up "the maiden condominium" as an 
example of the variety of the poems. 
It is different from the others. I really like the sound 
in this one. I don't get the full sense. This doesn't turn 
me off from being intrigued and trying to understand 
it. These are big words that have 
never been put in the same line 
together before in the history of 
the English language. (Then he 
reads the whole poem while CG iaughs.rgametocyte" 
and "banquet" don't rhyme but they go together. "Ga-
metocyte" is a sign of life. (CG and MN repeat "maiden 
condominium" and "control room of the banquet" and 
wonder what they could be. They are having fun and 
laughing.) 
There is some super power going on in this one. And 
big words. 
There is wonderful humor in these. Not standup comic 
humor, thank God. Not one liners. There is comedy in 
these. Whimsy. Along with lots of seriousness too. A 
great combination. 
Definitely one of my favorites. There is no "I" in it, except 
there is are "eyes"—someone is observing it, thinking 
it, and feeling it, and commenting about it. It's time of life Issue: 
powerful, and it's large and small at the same a bird of prey pulls up 
time; or general and specific at the same time. 
out of the way into the palm 
"time of life issue" could be abstract, but "a bird 
of prey pulls up" (CG says "wow" in the background) 
is very vivid and specific, and "out of the way into the 
palm" is both. It has a sort-of opening up. One of the 
ways good haiku and short poems work best is they look 
and feel somewhat tight, concentrated, and highlighted 
and momentary but there is a kind of opening up—and 
not just a fly-away, not an escape, necessarily, but an 
opening up. I feel this; this is a fantastic one. 
-DC 
I want to sing the praises of this one too. I want the 
pleasure of saying how much I like it. Because it took 
me two or three readings before I got it, before I had 
an image, and then it was transformer time. You know, 
everything just transformed. This one shows the power 
of the form because everything is working together, and 
I just got a strong image. And it changed, too—it wasn't 
just given to me. I had to work; there was space in the 
poem for me. I got the connection and that was the

-DC 
Then DC quickly mentions "day after day" as 
another example of good humor. 
"The maiden condominium" is a good example 
of something InkWell does well that poets have 
trouble with. InkWell is relentless in trying to find uncommon 
things to say and ways of saying things. It's not a coincidence 
that "gametocyte" and "banquet" almost thyme—Ink- day after day 
Well uses a concept called echoes to populate poems in the man's can 
with sonic echoes, a sort of musicality.

Poetry seems to be one of the tasks Turing and others con-
sider central to the idea of the Turing Test. Recall the first 
example exchange in a fictional exercise of the test: 
Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth 
Bridge. 
A: Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry. 
The Forth Bridge is iconic and considered a symbol of Scot-
land. In his critique of Thring's idea, Geoffrey Jefferson wrote 
the following in the British Medical Journal [13]: 
Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose 
a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and
