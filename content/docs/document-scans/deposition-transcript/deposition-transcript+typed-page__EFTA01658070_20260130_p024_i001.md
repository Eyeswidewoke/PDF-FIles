Trump Touts "Tremendous Success" In Development Of Coronavirus Vaccine. 
President Trump on Monday visited a Research Triangle Park company in North Carolina and 
touted progress toward treatments and a potential vaccine for COVID-19. The Raleigh News & 
Observer (7/27, Eanes, Murphy, Shaffer, 425K) quotes the President as saying at the beginning 
of his remarks at Fujifilm Diosynth in Morrisville, "We will achieve a victory over the virus by 
unleashing American scientific genius." Fujifilm Diosynth, the News & Observer notes, "is 
manufacturing a vaccine for the biotech company Novavax, which was awarded $1.6 billion 
from the federal government as part of an effort to speed up coronavirus vaccine development." 
Trump later told WRAL-TVVi Raleigh, NC (7/27, 170K) in an interview, "We're having 
tremendous success. That is why we are North Carolina today, because this is a great plant and 
great scientists and they are very close to having the vaccine. When that happens, we are 
going to distribute it in record time" and "if we can do that, that will be a great achievement. ... 
We are going to have a vaccine very soon, by the end of the year, maybe even a little sooner 
than that. That will be a great achievement. That would have been years ahead of schedule." 
Says Newsweek (7/27, Crisp, 1.53M), "If true, it would mark a significant achievement months 
ahead of schedule and give Trump potentially game-changing news as he faces his Democratic 
rival...in the November 3 election" - but "if Trump oversells, it could potentially sink his already 
struggling campaign." 
WNCN-TVVi Raleigh-Durham, NC (7/27, 17K) recounted that Trump "praised the hard 
work of people at this facility and ones just like it, all working toward creating a vaccine as part 
of the Administration's Operation Warp Speed. President Trump promised the United States 
would defeat the coronavirus in record time." Trump was shown saying, "We have shaved years 
off of the time it takes to develop a vaccine. In some cases, many years, and we have done it 
while maintaining the FDA gold standard for safety." WNCN added that Trump "said the hope is 
this strategy will cut down on people waiting for a dose of the vaccine." Trump also said, "We 
are mass-producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance. so, that on the 
day one that it's approved, it will be available to the American people immediately. ... There has 
never been anything like this in terms of speed, nothing even close." WJZY-TVVi Charlotte, NC 
(7/27, 8K) said that North Carolina "is not just a major technology hub, but a crucial state 
for...Trump to try to hold in 2020," and WrrN-TVVi Greenville, NC (7/27, 17K) that "the visit 
and the President's response to the pandemic was criticized by state Democrats...who say he 
could be doing more to fight this pandemic than he is." 
CNBC (7/27, Feuer, Kim, 3.62M) reports on its website that Trump also announced that 
"the US government has awarded Fujifilm a $265 million contract to expand the country's 
coronavirus vaccine manufacturing capacity." Trump said FIFIS "awarded the contract to the 
Fujifilm Texas A&M Innovation Center in College Station, Texas." 
The Hill (7/27, Samuels, 2.98M) reports "the trip to North Carolina was brief - he spent 
roughly an hour inside the biotech facility in total — but remained closely on message." To the 
AP (7/27), Trump's "handling of the coronavirus pandemic put his political fate in grave 
jeopardy. Now he's hoping to get credit for his administration's aggressive push for a vaccine -
and crossing his fingers that one gets approved before Election Day." The Washington Times 
(7/27, Howell, 492K) says that "battered by claims he fumbled the virus response," Trump also 
"rattled off his administration's push to build ventilators and replenish the federal stockpile of 
personal protective equipment, while distributing point-of-care testing machines to nursing 
homes." WXII-TV Winston-Salem, NC (7/27, Shrair, 109K) recounts that the President "also 
encouraged folks to social distance, wash your hands and wear a mask." 
All three major network newscasts covered the President's trip, highlighting the fact that 
he donned a mask - and not so much his optimistic message on vaccine development. Ben 
Tracy of the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/27, story 3, 1:20, O'Donnell, 4.46M) reported "Trump did 
wear a mask...during a visit to a biotech company in the key battleground state of North 
Carolina" which "is working on components for a coronavirus vaccine," and Peter Alexander of
