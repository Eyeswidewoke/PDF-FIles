History of Academic Medicine 
With regard to the medical school 
research intensity of faculty members 
active in 2007, we found that the 626 
NIH associates were 34% more likely 
than the 6,038 nonassociates to be at 
one of the top 10 schools (144 123%) 
versus 1,034 117%]. ratio 1.34; 95% CI 
1.15-1.56) and 47% more likely to be at 
one of the top 20 schools (268 (43%) 
versus 1.755 129%), ratio 1.47; 95% CI 
1.33-1.63). Again, these results were 
not substantially different after 
excluding women from the NIH 
associates (n 
0) and from 
nonassociates (n = 460). 
Finally, past NIH associates account for 
one of every six Nobel laureates in 
physiology or medicine between 1985

Through 1973 (Including Those Who Were Not Commissioned Officers) 
and 2007 and make up a similar 
proportion of members of the National

biomedical fields. Many of the NIH's top 
leaders also had their start in the ATP, 
including 4 directors and 10 institute 
directors. Table 1 identifies those NIH I

medicine. On entering academic 
medicine, the NIH associates who 
graduated from medical school during 
this era were more successful than their 
nonassociate peers at rising through the 
ranks. Our analyses indicate that 
among those with any academic 
appointment, NIH associates were 
better represented than nonassociates 
in the higher echelons of academic 
medicine: They were about twice as 
likely to have been a chair of a 
department and about three times as 
likely to have been dean of a school. 
Among active faculty in 2007, NIH 
associates were also more likely than 
nonassociates to be at the top-ranked 
research-intensive medical schools. The 
success of the associates is also reflected 
by their representation among 
honorary societies and career 
achievement awards. As former 
associates continue to hold leadership 
roles both in academic medicine and 
the NIH, they will likely keep exerting 
considerable influence on both the 
NIH's extramural research grant 
program and its intramural agenda. 
Beyond their personal successes in 
academic medicine, the associates also 
created a network of physician-scientists, 
as the collaborative efforts they 
established during this time period 
continued after they returned to their 
respective universities. "Science is a social 
enterprise, and it's this kind of informal 
college or interactions that determine the 
directions (of science' and what gets 
done," noted Alan Schechter?. who 
became an associate in 1965. "The 
program here allowed one to plug into 
this informal college." Michael 
Gottesman:7 a former associate and the 
current NIH deputy director for 
intramural research, felt that some 
associates "would have gone on to be 
successful in any case but most either 
wouldn't have had the opportunity or 
wouldn't have had the environment that 
fostered this kind of success." 
The high degree of later accomplishment 
and success of the NIH associates is likely 
related to many factors. These include the 
competition among young physicians to 
enter the ATP during the Doctor Draft. 
especially during the escalation of the 
Vietnam War, which helped the program 
recruit a high caliber of physician—scientists 
who might not have applied during 
peacetime. The ATP also offered
