No manaTMs land. 
Progress is merely decreation. ficeEnlia non swu multiplicanda praeser necessitaiem. We must not assume the existence of 
any entity until we are compelled to do so. This principle is purely destructive, it takes something away.fil Decreation: AceA 
person can doubt only if he has learned certain things; as he can miscalculate only if he has learned to calculate.A2 The 
advances of civilization are gross exaggerations; a function of the language with its built-in commitment to the accretive 
historical model. Flat earth: round earth. It isnamit a one hundred percent accretive advance from one to two: one hundred 
assumes and decreates ninety-nine. Round earth assumes and decreates flat earth. invisible assumes and decreates visible. 
Events assume and decreate matter. The relativistic universe assumes and decreates the mechanistic universe. AceProgress is 
always a transcendence of what is obvious:As dccrcation. Is it simply that Aceprogress in any aspect is a movement through 
changes of terminology:14
AcM no manaTMs land, or better said, a no signals region extends between past and future.A5 Universe is finite: no space-time 
continuum. A voice out of the past? The reliving of an experience? DonaTMt call it memory. Is it possible to remember? ficeA 
seeing into the past? It does not show us the past. Anymore than our senses show us the present. Nor can it be said to 
communicate the past to us.te 
Universe is finite: a process of decreation: the passing of the created into the uncreated. Decreation: the created passes into 
man-made invention. Reality passes into description. 
The end of the waste system. The waste: the generalizations of previous epochs. Decreation: getting through the history of 
words. We must not assume the existence of any entity until we are compelled to do so. ficeThe point is that unnecessary units 
in a sign language mean nothing.al
The accretive principle: the predominant way people live, like the oldfashioned idea of making a living; amounting to 
something. Stuff starts at one point and goes through accretive increments of time, of space, of history, etc., to get to another 
point. Universe: no accretion; no accumulation; no development; no continuity. Neither before nor after; neither behind nor 
beyond; neither here nor there; neither inside nor outside; neither from nor to: No direction; no between: no communication. 
Universe: a verb. Not existing in time, but time itself and not the time of past, present, future. Time undifferentiated in 
activity, not time of being. Universe: a decreated world: Acta moment in time / and of time. / A moment not out of time, but in 
time, in what we call history: / transecting, bisecting the world of time, a moment in time / but not like a moment of time, / A 
moment in time but time was made through that moment: / for without the meaning there is no time, and that moment / of 
time gave the meaningl 
Awkwardness: The only way to fit the uniqueness of insights into current laws. Awkwardness: stymied by perception, by 
knowledge Awkwardness: seethe primary advantage thus gained is that experience is not interrogated with the benumbing 
repression of common sense.A9
