SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Investment Manager or the Administrator is authorized to disclose such information concerning 
each Limited Partner to the Master Fund or as it determines is required in order to comply with 
any law, rule or regulation, or in response to any summons or subpoena, or in connection with 
any litigation. Each Limited Partner further agrees that, at the request of the General Partner, the 
Investment Manager or the Administrator, it will keep current any such information previously 
furnished and that the General Partner and the Investment Manager may rely on the accuracy and 
current status of such information in making (or determining the need to make) any filing on 
behalf of the Partnership. Each Limited Partner understands, acknowledges, represents and 
agrees that in the event a Limited Partner fails to honor any such request, the General Partner 
may be obligated to "freeze" such Limited Partner's Interest, have the Partnership redeem such 
Limited Partner's Interest, or force a sale to another person or entity such Limited Partner's 
Interest. 
Section 16.04. Entire Agreement This Agreement (including Schedule A attached 
hereto), the Subscription Agreements, the Side Letters (as defined herein) and any other writing 
between any Limited Partners and the General Partner or the Investment Manager entered into in 
connection herewith, shall constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the parties 
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall supersede any prior understanding or 
agreement, oral or written with respect thereto. The parties hereto acknowledge that, 
notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the General Partner, on its own 
behalf and/or on behalf of the Partnership, without any act, Consent or approval of any Limited 
Partner, may from time to time enter into, deliver and perform other written agreements with one 
or more Limited Partners establishing rights under, or supplementing or altering the terms of, this 
Agreement and/or the Subscription Agreements (each a "Side Letter"). The parties agree that 
any rights established, or any terms of this Agreement or the Subscription Agreements 
supplemented or altered, in a Side Letter shall govern with respect to such Limited Partner (but 
not any of such Limited Partner's assignees or transferees unless so specified in such Side Letter) 
notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement or the Subscription Agreements. The 
General Partner and the Partnership shall have no obligation to provide copies of any Side 
Letters to any Limited Partner. Each Limited Partner acknowledges that it has no rights under or 
with respect to any Side Letter to which it is not a party and waives any and all claims with 
respect to each such Side Letter and the rights and duties of the parties thereto. The Master Fund 
General Partner, on its own behalf and/or on behalf of the Master Fund, may also from time to 
time enter into, deliver and perform other written agreements with one or more limited partners 
of the Master Fund establishing rights under, or supplementing or altering the terms of, the 
Master Fund LPA and/or the Master Fund subscription agreements (each a "Master Fund Side 
Letter") with one or more limited partners of the Master Fund (including the Onshore Feeder 
Fund). Each Limited Partner acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the 
Master Fund LPA, (i) such Limited Partner shall not be entitled to the benefit of, and shall have 
no rights under or with respect to, any Master Fund Side Letter and (ii) the General Partner and 
the Partnership shall have no obligation to provide copies of any Master Fund Side Letter that the 
Partnership receives in its capacity as a limited partner of the Master Fund to such Limited 
Partner. Each Limited Partner waives any and all claims with respect to each such Master Fund 
Side Letter and the rights and duties of the parties thereto.
