I am very upset. I didn't lie and cheat and lead you on knowing I would never give 
you what you wanted. I participated in your life, your idea of fun, I accepted your 
lifestyle, I stood by you for years of legal battles and jail time. ( Why don't you read 
our emails during the time you actually went to jail ) I never said a bad word about 
you behind your back, there was nobody you could trust more or who loved you 
more. I've been perfect. All I wanted was more time with you, closer relationship and 
a family with you. I watched you in embarrassment for years introduce me to people 
as just another name in the line of your "friends", make fun of me behind my back, 
have other girlfriends, buy other people houses, cars, watches, luggage and jewelry 
and I never asked for the same. You promised me a baby, time alone, real estate 
broker deals, apartment in Prague, castle in Slovakia, house in Florida, cars, plane 
and did nothing. You ignored my birthdays, picked on me about the pettiest of 
errands and even took back a used car you gave me with a bow on it for Xmas with 
an excuse that you didn't really give it to me. I thank you for the nice times we had 
and letting me learn to fly. Although that was already towards the end when I needed 
something I enjoyed while you were spending months with 
and others in the 
office. I lived your life and catered to you for years and you make me sound like a 
monster for 'nagging' about spending quality time with you. Yes, I feel taken 
advantage of. 
I don't want to have a friendship with you that you have with all your ex-girlfriends. I 
know you. I've been listening to you mock them, share intimate details about them, 
not respect their privacy, parade your new girls in front of them when they want to 
talk to You, lie to them about their partners affairs, embarrass them when they ask 
you for help, sleep with their friends, sisters or daughters. I can't handle that and I 
can't trust you not to do it. As heartbreaking as finding myself in a position with 
nothing to lose is, it is also quite liberating. I hope you are happy with your decisions 
and find whatever it is you are looking for. 
I want to collect my things from your houses or have them sent and I'd like you to 
propose what you think is a fair arrangement moving forward. I want you to take Ball-
e. I can't have her.
