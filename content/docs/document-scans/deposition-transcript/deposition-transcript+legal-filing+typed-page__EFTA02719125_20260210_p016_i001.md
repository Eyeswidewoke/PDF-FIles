And for those who argue that changing the rules could bankru=t some sports programs.... I say malarkey. With billions 
of dollars in college sports, why not set aside some money dedicated to the athletes and this can=be a piece of the TV 
revenues and maybe you don't have to pay the coach $6=million and pay him $5 million. It is not implausible that that a 
system can be created that funnels at least some of=the money that goes to pay everybody else, making some very rich 
in the system except the players to at least at a minimum to provide healthcare. Gu=ranteed medical coverage should 
be the be the number one priority in college sports. 
=br> 
The other dirty secret in college spor=s is mental abuse because being a student athlete can be hazard to one's mental 
health. F=om day one student athletes are told that if they don't thrive in their meets =r games they can kiss their 
dreams goodbye. Most college coaches make it absolutely clear to their athletes that if they don't perform they will be 
fired, =osing their scholarship and sent home. And if they die they will be replaced in a nanosecond. This type of 'tough 
coaching' which is common in college sports oft=n borders on abuse and at a much higher rate than in health services, 
manufacturing, financial institutions, education and the military according=to the Ohio State Tepper Scale of Industry 
Differences in Abuse. Dr. Ben=ett J. Tepper blames the NCAA system. One that makes it very hard fo= athletes to 
transfer schools and punishes coaches who don't deliver wins. They have created a system where you have bosses who 
are under tremendous strain= The pressure to win is really high. Their job insecurity is r=ally high. That combined with 
students who have very little power, who can't get away, =an't escape and completely vulnerable and even when the 
NCAA knows of the abuse =hey more often take little action... leads to a pattern of continued abuse. 
Rebuild Gaza, and avert the next war 
A Pa=estinian schoolgirl walks though the rubble of destroyed buildings in the northern Gaza Strip on March 11.<=span> 
Nearly seven months after the end of the la=est war in Gaza, none of the underlying causes of the conflict have been 
addressed. In the meantime, the people of Gaza are experiencing unprecedented levels of deprivation, and the prospect 
for renewed armed conflict is very real. 
In June 20=4, the Hamas-backed government in Gaza was dissolved, and a reunified Palestinian Authority cabinet was 
created under =he leadership of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The international commun=ty reached a 
consensus, with tacit support from Israel, to empower this govern=ent to lead reconstruction in Gaza and, together with 
the United Nations, to tr=ck the delivery and use of building materials to address fears that cement and other supplies 
could be diverted to build tunnels into Israel. 
The $5.4 billion p=edged for rebuilding was predicated on the Palestinian Authority asserting itself in Gaza. However, 
relations between Hamas and its political rivals, Abbas's Fatah party, remain fraught= The authority has proven unwilling 
or unable to govern in Gaza. As a result, th= promised reconstruction money has not been delivered.
