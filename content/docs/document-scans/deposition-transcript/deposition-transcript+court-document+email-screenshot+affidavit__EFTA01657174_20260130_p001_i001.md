Deputy Director Bongino Says Illegal Alien Criminals and Child Predator 
Fox News (05/11, Baehr) reported that Deputy Director Bongino shared a detailed update Saturday about the bureau's operations, making clear the 
agency is focused on removing dangerous criminals and protecting children. In a post on X, Deputy Director Bongino outlined several priorities and took 
aim at what he called misleading media coverage of the FBI's work. "The workforce has been working overtime on task force operations to remove 
dangerous illegal aliens from the country. The work continues," Deputy Director Bongino wrote. "If you came here illegally to prey on our citizens, your 
days here are numbered." He said these operations are only getting started and will ramp up in the coming weeks. "These removal and incarceration 
operations will dramatically change the crime landscape in the country when combined with the administration's laser•focus on sealing the border shut," 
he added. Deputy Director Bongino also pointed to a new initiative to protect children from predators. "Crimes against children are a priority for the 
workforce. Operation 'Restoring Justice, where we locked up child predators and 764 subjects, in every part of the country, is just the beginning,' he 
said. 'We are going to take your freedom if you take away a child's innocence' He promised more enforcement efforts to come and warned those 
targeting children to 'think twice." Additionally, Deputy Director Bongino addressed the FBI's efforts to respond to Congress and the public about several 
high profile eases. These include the attack on Rep. Steve Scalise, the Nashville school shooting, the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, and the origins of 
COVID-19. He also mentioned the ongoing work with the Department of Justice in the Jeffrey Epstein case. "There are voluminous amounts of 
downloaded child sexual abuse material that we are dealing with,' he wrote. 'There are also victims' statements that are entitled to specific protections. 
We need to do this correctly, but I do understand the public's desire to get the information out there." He also responded to what he described as false 
stories being spread by some in the media and came to the defense of Director Patel. "He spends anywhere between 10 to 12 hours in the office 
attending meetings with everyone from foreign heads of law enforcement to our counterterror teams," Bongino wrote. "Any assertion otherwise is a 
verifiable lie designed to stop our reforms and fracture your trust. I will die on this hill. You are being clearly lied to by people with an agenda, and It's not 
your agenda." The article noted that Deputy Director Bongino dosed by thanking the public for its attention and encouraged Americans to keep watching 
the FBI's progress. "God bless America, and all those who defend Her," he wrote. Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Texan (05/09,
