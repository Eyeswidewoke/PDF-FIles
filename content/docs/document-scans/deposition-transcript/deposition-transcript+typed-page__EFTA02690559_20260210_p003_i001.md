they have developed a viable army that can defend their borders and police any 
internal insurgency. Such an army would reestablish a regional balance of 
power and that is a necessary condition for regional peace. There are huge 
leaps of faith in the above strategy and undoubtedly many slips between the 
concept and the execution. It would be a terrible mistake to underestimate the 
challenges to this vision, but the Middle East is such a dangerous place that 
some would suggest that we need a game changing strategy. We cannot beat 
terrorism with our army. We must have a strategy that addresses the root 
causes and empowers the indigenous populations to beat terrorism. I would 
also caution that this strategy, while academically fascinating runs the risk of 
destabilizing neighboring regimes and the consequences of this are 
unpredictable.

Turning Point?. It is always dangerous to predict history when you 
are in the middle of it, but let me paint the possibility that we are at a turning 
point in Iraq. The concept is that history will view the Battle of Basra (late 
March/ April, 2008) as a turning point. In the Battle of Basra, the Prime 
Minister, without any serious prior consultation with the US, sent Iraqi troops into 
Basra. (n.b. the British have had responsibility for security in Basra. By all 
accounts - American and Iraqi - they have done a less than adequate job. This is 
a widely held view and because the insurgents are as strong as our weakest 
link, there is general unhappiness with the British military) Anyhow, the Iraqi 
troops go into Basra and they initially faltered. No one had properly estimated 
the enormity of the problem that militias, Iranian-backed special groups and 
criminal elements constituted for Basra. Maliki (the PM) not only sent in troops, 
he enlisted the help of local elements, in particular tribal members, As the effort 
falters, Maliki (a Shia) calls for more troops from Anbar Province (a Sunni 
province) and they join the battle and, with some US assistance, they turn the 
tide. In the Battle of Basra, the Iraqi Army, for the first time took the lead in 
engaging the insurgents. The Iraqi army, initially faltered, adjusted both their 
tactics and the composition of their forces and then prevailed. This does not 
mean that Basra is a safe place; it does mean that the Iraqi army defined a goal, 
set their tactics, changed their force composition and achieved their goal. The 
initial mistakes make it all the more impressive because it means they adjusted 
for the conditions on the ground, executed the necessary changes and saw it 
through. The Americans then came in and provided support, but this was a 
victory for the Iraqi army and the Iraqi people in many ways. It was the Iraqi's 
elected leader who took on insurgents of his own Shia faith. This was viewed as 
an indicator that the government was a government for all Iraqis, not just for the 
Shia Iraqis. This was a victory for the Iraqi people because it demonstrated that 
their newly formed army can and will fight and that they can do so in a 
professional and effective manner. This was a victory for the Iraqi people 
because everyone knows that the Iranians are behind what is going on and the 
Iraqis took on the agents of the Iranians. This was a victory because for the first 
time it began to give Iraqis a sense of pride and national identity. In summary, it 
gave the Iraqis hope.
