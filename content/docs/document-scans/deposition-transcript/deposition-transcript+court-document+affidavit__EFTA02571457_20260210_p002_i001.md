We need to organize how we can complete the hot=l and restaurant open items 
I can come over to your office on Sunday to rev=ew the below I NEED TO CATCH UP TODAY AND PREPARE 
FOR THE BANK REVIEW ON M=NDAY SO EVERYONE ELSE CAN GET PAID 
I have cc Randy and howie so we can all address=this first point 
1/First - we had always agreed once the project=started to be delayed along with AP not being funded a 
new $800k budget wa= needed for the restaurant-this budget was based from the day of funding -=and with a 
September opening — which so far neither obviously has =appened 
we both had agreed to personally fund the resta=rant with $200k each -this was back before summer when 
we thought we would=open in late August 
Then in September when you where relaying on Ar=ade to fund a bridge loan - and we needed funds to 
complete time and weath=r sensitive construction items - ie the new roof, sidewalk and other items=-which I funded -
we both agreed to fund construction with $200k and where=to be repaid when Arcade funded -
-Arcade walked away from the loan and we where =ever reimbursed 
-Then when Crescendo stepped in to advance you =he 3.5mm loan -you advised them that $750k was going 
to the restaurant - t=is is not correct- why you positioned the proceeds this way is not accurat= 
We both need to be reimbursed from the Crescend= hotel loan -my loan is higher then $200k at this point -
but reimburse ea=h of us so we can then personally fund the restaurant- as we agreed upon 
So the hotels additional 
funding of the restaur=nt is $350 k not $750 
THE TOTAL AVAIALBLE FOR THE RESTAURANT IS $700,000, HOWEVER T=IS IS CALCULATED EITHER AS 
REIMBURSEMENT TO YOU AND I AND THEN RE LOAN OR =OTAL NEW LOAN TO RESTAURANT 
TO DATE THE RESTAURANT HAS RECIVED AROUND $650,000 
ESCROW ACCOUNT HAS $722,000 WHICH IS THE $700,000 STATED ABOV= AND $22,000 FOR ALAN'S 
REIMBURSMENT FOR PAYROLL LAST WEEK 
2/ Still to be addressed - which you have not r=sponded to - is an outline as to the possible shortfall in the 
restaurant =e could endure from January to April - complete budget sent to you weeks a=o SEE ABOVE PLEASE 
3/ I'm told you only are funding the re=taurant $700 k because you subtracted last weeks PR? This is not 
correct i= addition there are AP items that are not the restaurant responsibility 
tasting for bankers and loan people 
LUNCH FOR 3 PEOPLE COULD NOT OF BEEN =HAT MUCH AND IF NEED BE I WILL PERSONALLY PAY FOR THE FOOD COST 
=AO- the charity event on Monday to promote the hotel I WAS NOT AWARE OF AN= EVENT, UNTIL AFTER THE FACT 
,ALSO UNDERSTAND MONDAY'S EVENT GENE=ATED INCOME FOR THE RESTAURANT AND NOT THE HOTEL - we can 
address th=s at tomorrow's meeting SEE ABOVE PLEASE
