Subject: Estate Freeze 
Jeffrey, in a prior emai, I wrote: 
I would need to dig into the current structure to determine the best path forward. At this point, I see two options (after 
cleaning up the current trust issues): 
I. A freeze LLC is created. Leon contributes his art and receives a preferred interest, with an annual coupon. The trust 
contributes its interest in Black Family Partners, subject possibly to cleaning up some governance issues, and receives the 
common. (A variation of the theme is for Black Family Partners to contribute assets, rather than have the trust contribute 
partnership interests.) All appreciation, above the annual coupon. inures to the benefit of the common. The common also 
has the right to use property, provided the coupon is currant. the trust then grants Deborah, a beneficiary, the right to use 
the art. Or the an could be rented to Leon. 
2. Alternatively, we could explore the possibility of having Leon contribute the art to the existing partnership, which is 
restructured as a freeze partnership, with the same results as described in I. the only difference between this suggestion 
and the one described in I is that, in this alternative. we use the same (restructured) partnership. rather than having 
multiple layers. 
As to your recent inquiry about numbers. I do not have figures. However, a simple example is instructive. 
Suppose the value of the art contributed by Leon is $1.5 billion, while the financial assets contributed by the 
trust have a value of $2 billion. An appraiser, say Empire Valuation, would give us written advice as to the 
proper amount of the annual coupon so that the preferred has a value equal to its face amount. For purposes of 
the illustration, let's assume that figure is 7%. Under the foregoing assumptions, Leon would be entitled to 
annual distributions of $105,000,000. Presumably, the $2 billion of financial assets would generate sufficient 
cash flow to satisfy the coupon. If the freeze partnership is liquidated. Leon is entitled to the $1.5 billion. In the 
meantime, all appreciation (beyond the 7% coupon), both as to the artwork and the financial assets, and excess 
cash flow, would be outside Leon's estate. Also, since Deborah is a permissible beneficiary of the trust, so long 
as they are married, there is indirect access to the assets ascribed to the common interest via use by, or 
distributions to, Deborah.
