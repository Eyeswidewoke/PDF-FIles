providing funds to you for something-you needed. I made it clear and explicit at the time that I would no= submit to 
this procedure. Since your efforts and proposals simply r=peat the same procedure, they were a waste of time. 
There w=re some things in your letter that were correct. You're right th=t despite what has happened, I'm still a 
"wealthy man," with=income well above the median, though lacking a pension and accumulated pro=erty, not at the 
level of my peers. Furthermore, I can supplement my=income by teaching large undergraduate courses, something I'd 
never do=e and that is not that common for people approaching 90, but something tha= I enjoy. And you too are a 
wealthy man, for the same reasons: the r=asons are that I've worked hard all my life, lived fairly simply (and =ive even 
more simply today), and was therefore able to put aside enough mo=ey to ensure that my children and grandchildren 
are very well cared for, i=definitely. 
But I again suggest that we put all=of this aside, and deal quickly and simply with what appears to be the 
one=outstanding issue: dividing the Marital trust and then dissolving it, all =ery simple, needing no lawyers, at least on 
my part.

This is an =nteresting idea. We could consider it further, but I would need the =dvice of my lawyer —
and I assume you would want your own lawyer&#=9;s advice as well — to ensure that any agreement we reach is 
cons=stent with Massachusetts law and satisfies the interests, needs, and oblig=tions of everybody involved. Perhaps, 
as a next step, you could ask =our lawyer to contact mine and begin a discussion in which we all particip=te. 
I'm also curious to hear your thoughts ab=ut the proposals I suggested in my message on March 29th.

=ut now I'm writing just about one point, which seems to be the core of=the problem -- a 
problem, which, again, I don't understand. But =et's put that aside, though I hope we can clear it up soon. All =f this is a 
painful cloud that I never would have imagined would dar=en my late years. 
The core issue seems to be the =arital trust. I've explained how M and I actually set it up 
with=Eric, which seemed to us just plain common sense. I've also expl=ined Max's different interpretation. I've asked 
you for your=, but haven't heard it. But let's put that aside too, and ju=t resolve the matter, as can be done very simply -
- with no need for lawye=s to explain the fiduciary responsibility of the trustee I appointed years=ago to replace me, 
something I never paid any attention to before. 
The simple solution is to divide the trust into two parts= One part will go to you, to use as you 
wish. One part will go=to me, for me to use without any investigations of my financial situation =nd other such 
intrusions that I won't accept. Then the trust can=simply be dissolved, and it is all over. 
So I sug=est that we proceed this way, and end the whole matter -- at least, whatev=r it is that I 
understand about what is of concern to you.
