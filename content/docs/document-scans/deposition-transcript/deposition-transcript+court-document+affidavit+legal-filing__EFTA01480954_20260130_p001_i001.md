HEADLINE: The Sex-Trafficking Model Scout [Predators] 
BODY: 
Aug. 4, 2010 (Gawker Media delivered by Newstex) — 
Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier who the FBI believes molested around 40 underaged girls, was assisted by 
a prominent modeling agent and scout. Here's what we know about Jean Luc Brunel. 
Jeffrey Epstein, you will no doubt recall, is the man who thought ferrying Bill Clinton on his private jet, lawyering up 
with superstar Alan Dershowitz, and making frequent $100,000 donations to the Palm Beach Police Department 
would insulate him from prosecution for his various depravities. 
Which include f r h r cord: buying a 14-year-old Yugloslavian named 
from her parents in 
order to keep 
as his "sex slave"; paying a retinue of women to trawl Palm Beach for teenagers 
economically desperate enough to agree to give Epstein "massages" that often led to sexual contact; receiving two 
12-year-old French girls as a "birthday present"; and befriending Michael Wolff. 
But as 
wrote at The Daily Beast: 
Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, 
owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, [assistant and girlfriend Ghislainej Maxwell, Brunel, [house 
manager Alfredo) Rodriguez, and 
'deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring 
minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.' 
The FBI investigated Epstein, and identified around 40 underaged victims. 
reports that the FBI is also 
investigating MC2 and Brunel for possibly engaging in child sex trafficking. Since pleading guilty to reduced charges 
of soliciting sex with a minor and serving 13 months of part-time jail, Epstein has become the focus of numerous 
civil lawsuits from his victims. He has so far settled a dozen. 
These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America, Europe, and the former Soviet republics, 
few of whom spoke English, were recruited for Esptein's sexual pleasure. According to a former bookkeeper, a 
number of the girls worked for MC2 the modeling agency owned by Jean Luc Brunel, a longtime acquaintance 
and frequent guest of Epstein's. 
Brunel, along with numerous young models, was a frequent passenger on Epstein's private jet, according to flight 
manifests. The agency owner also allegedly received $1 million from Epstein in 2005, when he founded MC2 with 
his partner, Jeffrey Fuller; although Fuller and Brunel denied any such payment from the billionaire pervert in 2007, 
when rumors started swirling, 
got confirmation from a former bookkeeper at the agency. Whether the 
money was a secret investment in MC2, or a payment for Brunel's services as a procurer, is unknown. Brunel also 
visited Epstein in jail.
