We are adding a new section entitled Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges to the Agreement, reading in its 
entirety as follows: 
"Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges 
We use the Average Daily Balance method to calculate Finance Charges on your Account. Under this method, we calculate the 
Finance Charges on your Account by applying the DPR to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) separately for each Feature 
subject to a different DPR (including current transactions). Different DPRs may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the 
Average Daily Balance for each Feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for each day (including unpaid Finance Charges from 
previous bluing periods), (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) subtract any payments or credits credited as of that day, and 
(4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also add an amount of interest equal to 
the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and 
the beginning balance for that Feature for the next day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the 
daily balances for the Feature for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the 
Average Daily Balance for that Feature. 
For all Features, except for specific Charges or amounts added to a Feature during a billing period in response to a request, the 
Average Daily Balance for a billing period will be considered to be zero if you paid, by the Closing Date of the current billing period, the 
total Account balance, if any, shown on your previous billing statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each Feature by 
the number of days in the billing period and the DPR for that Feature, the result will be the Finance Charge assessed on that Feature, 
except for variations caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge for the billing period is calculated by adding the Finance Charges 
assessed on all Features of the Account. This method of calculating the Average Daily Balance and Finance Charge results in daily 
compounding of Finance Charges. We may use mathematical formulas which produce equivalent results to calculate the Average Daily 
Balance, Finance Charge, and related amounts. For example, we may utilize computer programs or other computational methods that 
are designed to produce mathematically equiValent results while using fewer and/or simpler computational steps than are described in 
this Agreement. 
At our discretion, we may exclude certain categories of debit transactions or fees from the calculation of the daily balances. Unless we 
elect to use a later date, we add a Charge to the daily balance as follows: For Charges (other than Finance Charges) that are added to 
a balance automatically, we add the Charge to the appropriate daily balance for the Feature as of the date the Charge is posted to the 
Account. For Charges that are not added to a balance automatically (e.g., in response to a specific transfer request), we add the 
Charge to the appropriate daily balance for the Feature as of the date we process the request. 
Periodic Finance Charges are added to the outstanding balance at the end of the billing period for which Finance Charges are 
calculated. In our sole discretion, we also may round any calculations made in determining the Finance Charges on your Account in 
any way that Is convenient to us. Any such rounding may apply to or cause variations in your DPRs." 
We are replacing the entire Suspension/Cancellation section of the Agreement with the following new section entitled 
Suspension/Cancellation: 
"Suspension/Cancellation 
In addition to any other actions we may take under this Agreement, we may suspend or cancel your Account, any Feature, or any 
component of your Account, and/or we may suspend or cancel the authorization of any Additional Cardmember to make Charges to 
your Account, at our sole discretion at any time, with or without cause, whether or not your Account is in default, and without giving you 
notice, subject to applicable law. Any such action on our part will not cancel your obligation to pay all Charges due on your Account 
under the terms of this Agreement in effect at the time of such action or as subsequently amended, and you agree to pay us all such 
Charges despite any such action. We may advise third parties who accept the Card that the Card(s) Issued to you and/or Additional 
Cardmembers have been canceled. If we cancel the Card or It expires, you may no longer use it and you must destroy It or return it to 
us or, if we request, to a third party. 
If you want to cancel the Account or any Additional Cards, you must notify us and destroy the Card(s). 
If we agree to reinstate your Account after a cancellation, the new Agreement we send you (or, if we do not send you a new Agreement, 
this Agreement as it may be amended) will govern your reinstated Account. When we reinstate your Account, we may reinstate any 
Additional Cards issued in connection with your Account, and bill you the applicable annual feats).* 
We are replacing the last paragraph of the Default section of your Agreement with the following: 
in the event of your default, and subject to any limitations or requirements of applicable law, we may require payment of a portion of 
your outstanding balance greater than the total Minimum Amount Due, declare the entire amount of your obligations to us immediately 
due and payable, and/or suspend or cancel your Account, any component of your Account, and/or any Feature that may be offered in 
connection with the Account. You agree to pay all reasonable costs, Including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us (1) in 
connection with the collection of any amount due on your Account, whether or not any arbitration, litigation, or similar proceedings are 
initiated; and (2) in reasonably protecting ourselves from any loss, harm, or risk relating to any default on your Account? 
We are deleting the entire Sign & Travel and/or Extended Payment Option Agreement from your Agreement document.
