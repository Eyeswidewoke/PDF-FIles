Closing costs of refinancing

For Tan to live on"

Obviously, there is play in this. 
We did not discuss interest rates or any other financial terms. 
The existing second mortgage lender is New Providence Capital Management Partners II Limited (NPCM), a 
Bahamian international business company, with an address in Nassau. It is controlled by David Kosoy, a 
Canadian who has been dabbling in Palm Beach real estate for 20 years and who has a piece of the Royal 
Poinciana Plaza along with Lee Munder. Dan said the interest rate is In the fives". It is due in January 2012-
academic since the first is due October 30, 2011. The subordination agreement between NPCM and TD 
prohibits any current payment of principal or interest on the second while the first is outstanding. I assume 
there was a reserve or discount to compensate for this. It does not appear that Dan personally guaranteed 
the second. 
I think (but don't know) that Dan found Kosoy through Jim McCann who has had some dealing over the years 
with Kosoy. Kosoy is a Toronto based real estate developer who buys distressed real estate and value 
adds(The Sterling Companies/Sterling Centrecorp) and NPCM is a mortgage fund he founded in the 
Bahamas in 2007 and runs. He was also involved in buying a bank in the Turks and Caicos. 
Dan is very uncomfortable with Kosoy. He says he regrets borrowing from Kosoy who "strung him along' "until 
he had no other alternatives". I notice that he had to give NPCM a second mortgage on 210 Miraflores- a 
house and lot adjacent to the Phipps Estate lot on which Dan lives- as additional security for the second on 
1220. Since, I don't think there is much more than $500,000 equity in 210 Miraflores, it seems that there was 
a hard bargain. 
Dan says that TD was very obliging in entering into an agreement (a Mortgage Subordination Agreement) but I 
read it and find it a strict subordination agreement, with several restrictions on what NPCM can do in the 
event of default. TD does give NPCM an option to buy the first for all amounts secured (including fees, 
advances and expenses) for a scant 10 days after notice of default. Nevertheless. TD asked for and got in 
exchange: a $998,000 principal paydown, a $1,041,379 interest reserve and a $137,849 tax reserve. (This 
was in January 2011.) This correlates to the use of proceeds he provided above. TD also got Dan's wife, 
Karen, as a guarantor. Dan already is a guarantor. 
Dan has discussed a refi nancing of the NPC M second with TD and says that TD would welcome it but wants 
an additional $1 million paydown plus an interest and tax reserve similar to what TD required in January. 
Dan's Finances 
I did not ask him to explain his financial condition at this stage but it seems obvious that he is illiquid from his 
'no alternative" comment and his characterization of the $1,467,000 balance of the proposed loan proceeds 
as "for Dan to live on'. I also think he has a problematic net worth. 
His visible real assets seem to be: 
1220 South Ocean. He has reduced the price to $64,900,000 and now owes $26,600,000. 'Survey says' a 
$40 number. Thus, Swanson's equity could range anywhere from 0 (if it doesn't sell before November) to 
say $14,000,000. See discussion below. 
205 Via Tortuga (Lot 17, Phipps Estates) (He lives in a house this land). He has a mortgage linked to a $6 
milion credit line extended by Northern Trust secured by this property and an adjacent lot (207 Via Tortuga). 
This note has a variable interest rate and the 'final due date' is October 2018. 205 Via Tortuga might be 
worth $5,000,000. 
207 Via Tortuga (Lot 18 Phipps Estates). This lot is adjacent to his house and covered by the same Northern 
Trust mortgage. It is about 20,000 sf and is listed with McCann for $5,500,000 but is probably worth around 
$4,000,000. 
Swanson's equity in 205 + 207 Via Tortuga combined (assuming the $6 million Northern line is fully drawn) is in 
the $3,000,000 range. 
210 Miraflores is an older 2000 sf Bermuda house adjacent to his Phipps lots. He rents it out. He paid 
$350,000 in 1995 and owes $700,000 on a 20 yr self-amortizing mortgage. He pledged it as additional 
security for the 1220 second held by NPCM in January 2011. It is probably worth $1,300,000. 
Interest in 101 El Bravo This is the spec house listed at $47 million. Jim Patterson of Louisville is his partner. 
McCann (who has the listing) says that they have had offers up to $30 million but Patterson has turned them 
down. Jim is allowed to say a deal can be made in the upper $30s but it seems there is buyer "reluctance" 
above $30. There is a $25,000,000 mortgage on it through U.S. Bank N.A. which was put in place in 
February 2011. If they could get $30M, Swanson's equity would presumably be $2,500,000 possibly less. 
(They paid $16.5M for the land in 2007.) 
This indicates Swanson's net worth from PB real estate is in the $6 million range + his equity in 1220 South
