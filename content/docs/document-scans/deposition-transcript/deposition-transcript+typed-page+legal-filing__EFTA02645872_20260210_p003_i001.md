electrocardiogram. He was astonishing as a diagnostician. He trained with Wallace Brigden in England who was one of 
the earlier pioneers in electrocardiography. He was a consultant to the royal heart hospital to the queen at one time 
before he came back to India, the British army. So, he was an amazing person but he was also very compassionate. On 
weekends he would see patients free of charge, and my mother would cook food for them and make sure they had 
enough money for their bus or their train. So there was a very compassionate aspect to him, but he didn't believe in 
religion or anything like that. 
So then when I went to medical school I totally embraced my father's constructs. Except for one or two experiences 
during medical school, which was in India by the way. And it was one of the newer medical schools after British 
independence, called the Indian Institute of Medical Sciences, and it was funded by, amongst other people, the 
Rockefeller Foundation, and so we had lots of international faculty. So in my fourth year of medical school, when the 
Beatles were in India—that's George Harrison behind you, by the way, in a turban sitting next to me. So that is a later 
picture but the Beatles came to India in 1969, when I was finishing my medical school. I didn't know these guys at that 
time. But Sergeant Pepper's had come out, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, and we had four medical students as visitors 
to our classroom for the summer from Harvard. And they had with them a bunch of LSD. So my first experience was—
and I was just near 18, when we had the first LSD experience. And then another one. Twice. And suddenly what my 
mother had been saying all these years about the world being an illusion was in the way an epiphany to me, at the age 
of 17. I mean I saw that the construction of—dissolving of boundaries like this, this, this and melting away. And then just 
colors and shapes and forms and sounds. And then a vast nothingness with no boundaries. But I was there. Not as a 
body, not as a mind, not as anything I could identify with, but just totally boundless. It was totally life-shifting at the age 
of 18 years. But then what happened is the medical school is very busy. You have to study, pass exams, this, that. And I 
put that aside, that experience side. 
Then at the age of 22, I came to the United States, and I had to do a lot of hardship to get here. My father wanted me to 
follow in his footsteps and be an academic. He was a professor, too, of cardiology. So I worked hard. India wasn't 
encouraging people to leave. I had to go to Sri Lanka to pass my exams, I had to borrow money to get a flight to the 
United States, I passed all that, I had to spend a year in New Jersey at a very ordinary community hospital, hard-working, 
and I got a residency in Boston with various hospitals with academics. So, Harvard, Tufts, BU, internal medicine, hard 
work, no thinking about consciousness whatsoever. Just passing one exam after another, getting one fellowship after 
another. 
And then I came here in 1970, July 1, basically as an intern in a hospital that no longer exists in New Jersey, 
MuhlenbergHospital, but then in the next year I got into all these academic institutions in Boston and went from one to 
another. I trained in internal medicine. And then I had heard vaguely of a discipline 
<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-control> called neuroendocrinology, and I had also heard vaguely of 
this new revolution in medicine at that time, which was looking at peptides in the circulation. And the peptide that was 
very popular at that time was something called opiates, which are now popular again, and the opioid receptor, with 
somebody called George Solomon in Washington, who was an expert in that, but I discovered that the number one guy 
in the world in neuroendocrinology at that time was a professor at Tufts New England Medical Center, and his name was 
Seymour Reichlin and he was a legend. Okay, so, if you found a snake in his garden he would dissect it and look at the 
hypothalamus and identify receptors for opioids <https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/opioids>, 
serotonin, this and that. I'll show you his photo recently. I just met him the other day at the consciousness conference, 
which is bizarre because I hadn't met him in all these years. He's 94, and he was giving a lecture on serotonin and 
mystical experiences, at the age of 94, and he came to my lecture, and he was one of the most amazing guys in the 
world, actually. It was a real joy to meet him. This is him, let me show you. Anyway I'll show you his photo in a second. 
He's 94, he gives talks on serotonin, but he was a legend. 
I got a fellowship with him, and through him I met somebody who is no longer alive, Candace Pert, who had actually 
discovered the opioid receptor, and she and I met at a conference. She later became the chief of brain chemistry at the 
NIH. And she told me these molecules that we're talking about, serotonin, opiates, oxytocin 
<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/oxytocin> , dopamine 
<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dopamine> they are the molecules of emotion. So that's the first time
