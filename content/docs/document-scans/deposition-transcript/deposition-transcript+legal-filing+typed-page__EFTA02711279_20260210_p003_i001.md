use of every word stands in complementary relation to attempts at its strict definition.F This exercise sets forth exact notions 
with the inexact language of the spurious names and generalizations that have crept into the language as truth. mereaTMs no 
other way. aceThere are no precisely stated axiomatic certainties from which to start. There is not even the language in which 
to frame them. The only possible procedure is to start from verbal expressions which when taken by themselves with the 
current meanings of their words arc ill-defined and ambiguous.a23 Welcome the contradictions, welcome the confusion . . as 
you would success. 
The coupling of observer observed system is finite. The observation, the measuring operation, is irreversible. The real world 
measured itself out of existence. aceThe model need not be that of an objective, immovable world around us. Philosophers of 
our time cannot ignore the fact that Interaction be tween observer and observed is finite and cannot be made as small as 
desired. Observation and perturbation inevitably go together and the world around us is in perpetual flux because we observe 
it.a24
ficeA physical quantity must not be defined by verbal reduction to other familiar conceptions, but by prescribing the operations 
necessary to produce and measure it.a21 Universe is finite decreation of the outside world, independent of us; decreation of 
the outside world not directly accessible to us. The description is the thing. The description: a mathematical formulation, the 
statistical expression of coupling. aceThe making of models or pictures to explain mathematical formulae and the phenomena 
they describe is not a step toward, but a step away from reality.P Universe is finite: not a word, and yet another kind of 
word, and acethe word must be the thing it represents.F 
No nouns: acethe notion of an actual entity as the unchanging subject of change is completely abandonedO The unity is unit-
less: aceAn actual entity is at once the subject experiencing and the superject of its experiences. It is subject-superject and 
neither half of this description can for a moment be lost sight of.10 Unitless unity: the negation of one. Unitless unity. the 
operation, the statistical expression of coupling, of activity. Unitless unity: aceThe poet and his subject are inseparable.V' 
There is no ultimate subject. aceBefore the birth of Doubt / Werryou and Invere one, / Who now, slack, / Arc both 
undonerall 
ficeTo measure is to disturb.V aceWe used to imagine that there was a real universe, outside of us, which could persist even 
when we stopped observing it.a33 The negation of the empirical notion of antecedent observation: Acewe can never catch the 
world taking a holiday.ii" Observation and perturbation inevitably go together and a'cethe method of pinning down thought to 
the strict systematization of detailed discrimination, already effected by antecedent observation, breaks down.a" aceEach 
observation destroys the bit of the universe observed, and so supplies knowledge only of a universe which has already become 
past history.a'R We cannot abstract ourselves from the world. We form together with it, an inseparable whole. There are no 
actors and spectators, but a mixed crowd . . . Acereject, absolutely renounce the idea of an objective real world.a37 The 
concern is with Aceour observation of nature, and not nature itself.A" 
Description is the thing. Decreation of the idealized real world, the thing world, the people world. AccExperiments are the 
only elements which really count.A3-2 Coupling of observer-observed, an event: the matter of fact. aceThe elementary particles 
themselves are not as real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than of things and factst Physical 
phenomena: not things made of matter. Coupling: the matter of fact. AceDo not look behind the facts since the facts 
themselves make up the doctrine.itm Physical phenomena: coupling: the matter of fact. ficeTo confront fact in its total 
bleakness is for any poet a completely baffling experience. Reality is not the thing but the aspect of the thing.A42
Unnecessary units in a language mean nothing. The unnecessary unit: an invention. The real world: an invention. Invention: a 
question of decreation. Invention: a question of realization, not intention. We must not assume the existence of any entity 
until we are compelled to do so. aceWe approach a society / Without a society/e) We are compelled to assume the existence
