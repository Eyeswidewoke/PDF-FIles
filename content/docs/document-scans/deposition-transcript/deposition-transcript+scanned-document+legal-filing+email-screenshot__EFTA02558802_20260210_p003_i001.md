them. In =hort, DNA the critical evidence may have been contaminated by sloppy =rocedures. So on October 3, 2011, 
the court threw out the murder and =exual violence convictions of Amanda and Raffaele. Both were =mmediately 
released from prison, and, in a happy ending, Amanda flew =ack to America and got a book contract. 
There are still three theories about the murder. First, the inside =ob theory advocated by the prosecutors, who are 
appealing the =cquittal. Second, the lone burglar theory that holds Rudy Guede =roke into cottage, encountered, and 
killed Meredith. Third, the =wo-burglar theory, based on an alleged jail house confession Guide =ade to a fellow prisoner 
(who testified at the Appeals hearing.) 
My assessment is that Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito are both =nnocent of the murder. The police investigation 
was wedded from the =utset to the wrong narrative. It assumed that the crime scene had =een staged to look like a 
burglary and so focused on the only =vailable insider, Amanda. In doing so, the police neglected =ye-witness sightings 
of a possible black burglar running from the =irection of the house at the approximate time of the crime, and they 
=rovided a description. If they had investigated that obvious lead, it =ould have quickly led them to Rudy Guede, who 
the other residents in =he house could identify. His finger prints, palm prints, sneaker =rint, and DNA inside the victim 
then would have established him =eyond a doubt as a person at the bloody scene. And he likely would =ave been 
arrested before he had a chance to flee to Germany. 
Guede had the opportunity, means, and motive to commit the crime =lone. He had been to the cottage earlier that 
week to watch a sports =vent so he could have cased it for a later burglary when its residents =ent on holiday over the 
long November 1st weekend. He was experienced =n such jobs, since had broken into other three places that fall. 
=here were a number of ways he could have entered the cottage. With =he help of a box, it is possible he climbed 
through the broken window. =e also could have easily scaled the grate in the rear of the cottage =nd enter through the 
empty basement apartment (where Meredith had =greed to water the Cannabis plants). Alternatively, he could have 
=one in through a lower window. Afterwards, he might have smashed the =indow from the inside to create an 
expedient means of an exit, =specially if he was in a panic. His DNA was found in Mededith's =ocketbook, and 300 Euros 
and credit cards were missing, which he =ikely took. And with a small pocket knife, he had the means to force =er to the 
floor, and stab her. In short, there was no reason from the =vidence at the murder scene, that this was not the work of 
a single =ome invader. 
The appeals court stated that the murder and sexual violence =harges against Amanda and Raffaele were " not 
corroborated by any =bjective element of evidence." If the so, the orgy scenario was =onjured up out of thin air by the 
prosecutors.
