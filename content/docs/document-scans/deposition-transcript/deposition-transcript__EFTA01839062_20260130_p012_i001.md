Motion. The company could determine this time because a Blackberry, as do many other smart 
phones, continues to send a signal as to its location even when it is turned off. BlackBerry could 
also electronically determine that the GPS signals on DSK's phone had abruptly stopped at 12:51, 
indicating either that the battery had run out or that the GPS had been intentionally disabled. (A 
forensic expert later concluded from the strength of the previous signals that the latter most likely 
happened). So either his phone was still in the presidential suite or someone at the hotel had taken 
it from the Sofitel after 12:51 PM (when it was no longer traceable). 
At 3:29 PM, evidently still unaware of what was happening at the Sofitel, DSK called the hotel 
from the taxi, saying, according to the police transcript, "1 am Dominique Strauss-Kahn, I was a 
guest. I left my phone behind." He then said he was in room "2806." 
At that time, Diallo had just left the hotel en route to St. Luke's hospital to be examined, but the 
police were still at the hotel. He was asked to give a phone number, so that he could be called 
back after someone searched for his phone. He furnished it. 
Police and security staff, using a security electronic key at 3:33 PM, then re-entered the 
presidential suite. The police did not find the phone. 
When DSK was called back thirteen minutes later, he spoke to a hotel employee who was in 
the presence of police detective John Mongiello. The hotel employee falsely told him that his 
phone had been found— it has never been found-- and asked where it could be delivered. DSK told 
him that he was at JFK Airport and that "I have a problem because my flight leaves at 4:26 PM." 
He was reassured that someone could bring it to the airport in time. 
"OK, I am at the Air France Terminal, Gate 4, Flight 23," DSK responded. 
So the police, who were behind the ruse, rushed to the airport. 
At 4:45 PM, the police called DSK off the plane and took him into custody. He was driven 
back to New York City and held in custody/

The Rush To Judgment 
The police arrived on the scene at the Sofitel at 2:05 PM. Two uniformed policemen can be 
seen on the CCTV tape. They walked through the main lobby to the security area, where they 
were greeted by the hotel's manager, Florian Shotz, who himself arrived only 10 minutes earlier 
on his motor scooter. The police then escorted Diallo to a private room. It is not clear when they 
began questioning her or officially took control of the case. According to the prosecutor's bill of 
particulars, members of the hotel security staff had remained in contact with Diallo at least for 
another 25 minutes, since it states that at 2:30 PM "a photograph of the defendant was shown to 
the witness [i.e., Diallo] by hotel security without police involvement." If so, even after leaving 
the bench (and video surveillance) and going to a room with the police, she remained available to 
the Sofitel staff (I asked both Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne and Deputy Inspector Kim 
Royster why, according to the bill of particulars, the police were not officially involved at this 
point, but they declined to comment.) Nor was the presidential suite entered by the police, 
according to the records, until 2:52 PM, which was 5 minutes after Sheehan, the Accor safety 
director. arrived at the hotel. It was not until 3:28 PM, when the police took Diallo to St. Luke's 
Hospital. She was finally medically examined and they then formally interviewed by police
