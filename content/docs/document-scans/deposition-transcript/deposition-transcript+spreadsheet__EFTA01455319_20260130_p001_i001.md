The following crannies imitate how the total returns set forth in the table above are calculated 
Resolute 1: A Knock-Out Bent does not occur, and the Intl of die Reference Asset decreases than the Initial Level of L764.29 to a hypothetical blnal Level of 
2,487.86. Because a Knock-Out Event has not occurred and the Reference Return of-10.00%. is less than the Contingent Marimum Return of 4.00%. the investor 
benefits from the Contingent Minimum Return and receives a Payment at Maturity of 51.040.00 per 51.000 Principal Amount of Notes. 
51.000 - (51000 - 460)- $1.040.00 
&ample 2: A Knock-Out Bent does not occur. and the level of die Reference Assn increases from the Initial Lad of 2.764.29 to • hypothetical Hnal Level of 
3,040.72. Because a Knock•Out Event has not occurred and the Reference Return of 10.0098 is greater than the Contingent Minimum Return of 400% but less 
than the Maximum Return of 17.00%. the investorreceives a Payment at Maturity of S1.100.00 per 51.000 Pritcipal Amount of Notes. calculated as follows: 
51.000 + (51.000 
1 Ott) = 81,10100 
Example 3: A Knock-Out 0.ent does not occur, and the level of the Reference Asset 'nemeses from the Initial Intl of 2.764.29 to a hypothetical Mal Level of 
3.593.58. Because a Knock-Oat Event has not occurred and the Reference Return of 30.001% is greater than the Marimum Mum of 17.0'. the investor receives a 
Payment at Maturity of SI.I70.00 per 51.000 Principal Amount ofNotes, calculated as follows: 
$l.
 + (81.000 = 179%)- St.170.00 
&ample 4: A Knock-Out Pies has occurred, and the Intl of the Reference Asset decreases from the Initial Intl of 2.76419 to • hypothetical Heal Intl of 
1458.57. Became a Knock-Out Event has occurred, and the Reference Return is 4000%, the investor is exposed to the negative performance of the Reference 
Asset. The investor will receive a Payment at Maturity of 550..00 per 51,000.00 Priicipal Amount of Notes, calculated as follows:
