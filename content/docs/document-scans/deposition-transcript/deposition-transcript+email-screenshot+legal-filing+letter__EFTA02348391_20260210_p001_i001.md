RE: Re: 
Forty years ago, Israel was one of the most admired countries in the world. Now it is most disliked. Forty years ago it 
was pretty clear, as I wrote at the time (and I was far from alone), that those who call themselves "supporters of Israel" 
are in fact supporters of its moral degeneration, international isolation, constant conflict and security problems, and 
maybe worse. So it has occurred. Israel even now has an official whose task is to deal with international isolation. 
Israelis like to attribute all this to anti-Semitism, which hasn't changed in the past 40 years. Or to appeal to "we have no 
negotiating partner," which won't wash. The problem is not Netanyahu. The policies and problems are much deeper. 
The crucial question is how long and how far will Israel proceed on the course to self-destruction. 
A lot of work in AI, neural network theory, "Big Data and statistics," etc., is as you describe — mimicking behavior (which I 
don't even find amazing or particularly interesting). But I think you underestimate the theoretical insights and 
explanations, such as the few I mentioned in the papers I sent, the theories that yield explanations for such surprising 
phenomena as rigidity and structure-dependence, with their far-reaching consequences. Those I think are the kinds of 
results that are rarely found outside the hard sciences. They don't mimic behavior, but explain fundamental properties 
of cognitive processes that enter into behavior, of course indirectly. And there's a lot more like it.

1.do you have any specific questions for him? he thinks its not going in the right direction. ie. bibi, not strong enough 
to make tough decisions. . ehud trusts hamas more than abbas. I know you dont like telephones but we could set up a 
text exchange if you wanted to. 
2. more important 
I use my coin flip analogy often. ie. . single cell experiments, like looking through a microscope at my coin , measure 
its content it moment, its shape, all trying to figure out why the result after a long while is always the same -equal 
number of tails and heads. a consistent result. no algorithm , no computation . Why i am pushing you on this , is that 
i firmly believe that language needs a theory, cognitive science needs a theory, your minions and intellectual offspring 
are like bio engineers --they will be able to mimic some of the behavior, yes it is amazing but not interesting. you 
have thought long and hard and more importantly have seen what does NOT work. einsteins thought experiments led 
to truly remarkable results in physics. Im hoping that results like that can be achieved for biology

Have a good weekend. I wonder what he thinks about where the state is heading now. 
We'll probably be at the Cape, in Wellfleet, if we can make it. 
Maybe there are miracles, but I think more prosaic approaches yield rich results in domains like vision (Marr's main 
concern) and language. Like some of those I've mentioned. I don't see how to progress in other ways.
