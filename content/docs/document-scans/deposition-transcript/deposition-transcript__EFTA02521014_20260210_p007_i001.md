that our Islamic Enemy is NOT like us and will not respond in like kind. Rather, as we repeatedly refuse to learn, 
appeasement invites more abuse from an enemy. This becomes the "game of guilt;" it tends to expand to greater and 
greater consequences. Paradoxically, psychological defenses tend to create the very outcomes they seek to eliminate 
and it is no different here. It is a game we love to play but, unfortunately, the game gives us no rules for how to end it. 
All beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along 
with other Control Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing. 
FP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely 
because of our Control Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers. 
Siegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see 
what he was about, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that 
could allow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was blatantly voicing his Islamist views and Jihadi 
intent including, even, an essay recommending the "painful liquidation" of non-Muslims. Yet, in the Army of all places, 
the Control Factor operated to allow and even foster his work. Even after the murders, we cont inue the denial by 
calling it "workplace violence." He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad combo! And we continue to enable the same 
infiltration elsewhere. 
FP: Tell our readers about "The Project" and "Explanatory Memorandum." These are realities 
that serve as great threats to the Control Factor, right? 
Siegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood's goals and 
plans underlying the Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. The 1991 Explanatory 
Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation trial and describes the Brotherhood's work in America 
as a "Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means" and "a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the 
Western civilization from within and 'sabotaging' its miserable house by their own hands and the hands of the believers 
so that it is eliminated and God's religion is made victorious over all other religions." 
Much as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term 
plan to destroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying the nuclear family, 
secularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategies to infiltrate while eroding the 
foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into an Islamic one. The Control Factor has many ingenious ways 
to convince us that this is ridiculous, that our courts and system would never allow such a thing, that one is racist or 
"Islamophobic," if not insane, for even thinking this is real. And just as with the communists, time is plentiful. Even more 
so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-decade plan is short term. It is not critical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to 
see the result. It is critical, more correctly a duty, however, that he carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for 
Security Policy's Team B Report, Shariah: The Threat to America 
chttp://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/upload/wysiwyearticle%20pdfs/Shariah%20-
%20The%20Threat%20to%20America%20%28Team%208%20Report%29%2009142010.pdf> , are excellent sources for 
your readers to pursue these documents. 
FP: And so what you call an "Inner Jihad" has to start. It's our, as you say, mandatory "addiction 
treatment." Please explain. 
Siegel: The "Inner Jihad" is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control 
Factors. There is a famous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, essentially says that the 
physical fight was the "lesser Jihad" and it is time to then attend to the "greater Jihad "- that internal battle against our 
own internal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to say that "Jihad" 
is not violent, it is useful to us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally against our own Control Factor 
tendencies.
