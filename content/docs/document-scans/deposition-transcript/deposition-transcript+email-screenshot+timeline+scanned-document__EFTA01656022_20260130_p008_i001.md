FBI to Announce Reward Friday for Missing 13-Year-Old Montana Crow Girl 
KTVQ (CBS-2) (06/05, Klepps) reported that the FBI is holding a press conference on Friday and offering an award 
for any information regarding a 13-year-old girl from Gerryowen who has been missing since October. Sa'wade 
BirdinGround, an autistic girl, first disappeared from her home in Crow Agency on Oct. 6. Since then, few details 
have been released on the case. According to the article, the FBI is looking to take the investigation one step 
further. On Friday, a press conference will be held at Little Big Horn College at 10 a.m. with a reward announced for 
any possible leads. 
Arizona Teen, 14, Found Dismembered Told Cops She Wanted Out of Group Home Before She Was Found 
Dead 
The New York Post (06/05, Reilly) reported that a 14-year-old girl who was found dismembered on the side of a 
road in Arizona had previously told police that she hated the group home she had vanished from when she had run 
away years earlier, new body camera footage shows. Emily Pike was murdered after she disappeared on Jan. 27 
from the Mesa group home, run by Sacred Journey Inc., where she was reported missing three different times 
before in 2023. New bodycam footage of one of the previous incidents, dated Sept. 20, 2023, shows Emily walking 
along a canal when an officer calls her name repeatedly as he approaches her and asks her to stop. The article 
mentioned that the teen, whose family lives on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, insists that the facility is 
not her home, telling the cop she'd rather live with her grandmother instead. The Mesa Police Department, FBI, 
and Bureau of Indian Affairs have organized a task force to track down Emily's killer. 
Washington Sheriff Shares New Photo of Suspected Killer Dad Amid Manhunt in Daughters' Triple Murder 
Fox News (06/05, Ruiz) reported that a Washington state survivalist has been on the run from authorities for nearly 
a week after allegedly killing his three young daughters, who were found with plastic bags over their heads and 
bound wrists at a campground in Chelan County Monday. Travis Caleb Decker, 32, did not have custody of the girls 
— all of whom are believed to have died from asphyxiation. Decker spent time in the military and is an avid 
outdoorsman, according to authorities. "We're getting more confirmation, that he might have possibly gone 
through Mountain Survival School," Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison told reporters Wednesday. "But we also 
know, too, that he's been an outdoorsman since he was a kid." On Thursday, he released a new photo showing 
Decker's tattoos and said search warrants had generated leads. He urged homeowners and people with mountain 
cabins to lock their doors — including to sheds and outbuildings, leave their blinds open and turn on outdoor 
lighting. 
Luigi Mangione's Alleged Diary Entries Released in New Court Filing 
NBC News (06/05, Lavietes) reported that Luigi Mangione wrote about plans to kill UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian 
Thompson in his diary months before Thompson was gunned down in New York City last year, state prosecutors 
alleged in a court filing Wednesday. According to the article, Mangione, 27, who has pleaded not guilty to state and 
federal charges in connection with the murder in December, used a red notebook as a diary to document his plans 
to kill Thompson, the court filing alleges. Authorities confiscated the notebook during Mangione's arrest in 
Pennsylvania after a five-day manhunt for Thompson's killer. In submitting the court filing, state prosecutors were 
trying to justify the terrorism enhancement added to Mangione's first-degree murder charge. Last month, 
Mangione's attorney filed a motion to dismiss the state murder charges. 
FBI Places Warning Signs at Northeast Ohio Crypto ATMs to Stop Would-Be Scam Victims 
W010 (CBS-19) (06/05, Picciano) reported that the very latest Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) report shows 
$9.3 billion worth of crime related to cryptocurrency. Every day, the FBI is attempting to find the offenders and put 
a stop to them, but success rates are low when it comes to getting your money back. According to the article, the 
FBI has a new method they're using to try and stop people from becoming a crypto scam victim in the first place. 
The article quoted FBI Special Agent Milan Kosanovich, who said, "So people who don't have bank accounts but still 
want to transit money to friends and family, whether it be across the country, overseas, whatever it is. It's a way to 
do that. It's a way to do investments, too, if you prefer to onboard yourself into the crypto ecosystem that way," he 
said. The Cleveland FBI office is now sending out signs to all of the bitcoin operators in the area to serve as a 
warning sign for those using crypto atms for the first time. "If you're using the crypto ATM because somebody that 
you don't know has told you you have to do this in order to avoid arrest, prosecution, or to escrow your money or 
something, we want to give you that chance to take a second thought and say, "hey, look, I should really think 
about this before I hit send, because once I hit send, I can't do anything to get this back," said Agent Kosanovich.
