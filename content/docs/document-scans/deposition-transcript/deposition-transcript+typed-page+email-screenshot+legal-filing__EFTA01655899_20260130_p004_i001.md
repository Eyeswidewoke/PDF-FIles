disinformation on X has increased under Musk's leadership, but the issue was largely ignored during their 
conversation, save for a brief mention by Trump of a "rigged election." The New York Post (08/12, Christenson) 
reported that while Musk stated that a "massive" cyberattack delayed his Spaces interview with Trump on Monday 
night, company insiders spilled to the Verge (08/12, Valle, Robison) that likely no such cyberattack took place. The 
article noted that one insider went as far as to say there was a "99% chance" that Musk had lied about it. "There 
appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down," Musk posted 18 minutes after the 
scheduled start time for the interview. The article added that the conversation kicked off a little after 8:40 p.m., 
with the X owner saying, "As this massive attack illustrates, there's a lot of opposition to people just hearing what 
President Trump has to say." Additional reporting on the story was provided by the Wall Street Journal (08/12,

FBI Is Investigating Suspected Iranian Hack Attempts Against Trump and Biden Campaigns 
The Wall Street Journal (08/12, Volz, Ward, McMillan) reported that the FBI is investigating suspected Iranian 
hacking attempts against both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns, reflecting concerns that Iran has become a 
major foreign election threat to the U.S. According to sources, the FBI began investigating in June after at least 
three Biden-Harris campaign staffers were targeted with spear-phishing emails, though these attempts were 
reportedly unsuccessful. The article added that the FBI also confirmed that it is probing a successful cyberattack 
that led to the theft of internal documents from the Trump campaign, which was disclosed to the public and 
attributed to Iran. This investigation marks the first indication that the U.S. government is seriously addressing the 
threat of Iranian interference in the upcoming presidential election. The article noted that Roger Stone, a close 
Trump ally, revealed that he was notified by the FBI and Microsoft about the compromise of his personal email 
accounts by a foreign nation-state, with the aim of phishing Trump campaign officials. Stone confirmed his 
cooperation with the investigation, stating, "I am cooperating with the investigation." Additionally, the article 
explained that Iran has quickly emerged as the chief election security concern within the U.S. government. Just last 
month, U.S. intelligence officials told media reporters that Russia was the "pre-eminent threat" to the November 
vote and viewed Iran as a lesser concern seeking solely to generate discord. But weeks later, they shared that their 
assessment on Iran had changed: Tehran wasn't just hoping to spread chaos, they said, but aiming to harm Trump's 
candidacy, as it haphazardly sought to do four years ago. Iran was also attempting to directly engage Americans in 
its influence operations and even provide funding to support Gaza protests on college campuses, officials said, 
while relying on "vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills to spread disinformation." Additional

Trump Plans to Sue DOJ Over Mar-A-Lago Search and Prosecution 
NBC News (08/12, Rubin, Gregorian) reported that an attorney for former President Donald Trump has filed a legal 
notice announcing that his client plans to sue the DOJ and the FBI for $11S million for alleged "malicious political 
prosecution" and "abuse of process." The article stated that the notice baselessly accuses DOJ leadership and 
special counsel Jack Smith of having perpetrated a "malicious political prosecution aimed at affecting an electoral 
outcome to prevent President Trump from being re-elected" — a frequent accusation that Trump makes online and 
during campaign events. The article added that the filing complains that the FBI's court-approved search for 
classified documents at Trump's Florida estate in August of 2022 was improper, as was Trump's 
subsequent indictment for the scores of sensitive classified documents that agents turned up during the search. 
According to the article, the filing said the search violated "well-established protocol" involving former presidents 
and cites a Trump social media post after the search saying the government could have had the records "anytime 
they wanted." CNN (08/12, Polantz, Reid) reported that the claim alleges that Attorney General Merrick Garland 
and Director Wray, who signed off on the search, made the decision inappropriately, with negligence and 
that Trump and his attorneys said they were surprised by the FBI's arrival at the property. The article quoted the
