generality of the foregoing, to the extent required in order to attain or ensure such 
treatment under any applicable law, Treasury Regulation, Revenue Procedure, Revenue 
Ruling, Notice or other guidance governing partnership interests transferred in 
connection with the performance of services, such action may include authorising and 
directing the Fund or the General Partner to make any election, agreeing to any condition 
imposed on such Limited Partner, its Affiliates or its transferees, executing any 
amendment to this Agreement or other agreements, executing any new agreement,
