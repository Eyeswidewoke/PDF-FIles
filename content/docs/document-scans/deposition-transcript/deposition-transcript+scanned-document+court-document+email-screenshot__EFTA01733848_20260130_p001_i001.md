Re Jeffrey E Epstein: New York State and SORNA registration notification 
Dear Ms 
Jeffrey Epstein, d/o/b/ 01-20-1953 , when in New york, resides at 9 E 71" St, New 
York, New York 10021. In June of 2008 he plead guilty to two criminal charges brought 
by the State Attorney for Palm Beach County, one of which required him to register as a 
sex offender in the State of Florida. Accordingly, he is registered as a sex offender in the 
State of Florida. Because his primary residence is in the Virgin Islands, he has also 
registered as a sex offender in that jurisdiction. 
Mr. Epstein's State of Florida offenses were for felony solicitation of prostitution 
between August i, 2004 and October 31, 2005 in violation of Florida Statute 
796.07(1)(Indictment 06-9454CF) and for Procuring a Person Under 18 for Prostitution in 
violation of Florida Statute 796.03 (Information No 08CF9381). The latter required 
registration. It was based on conduct occurring between August I, 2004 and October 9, 
2005 with a person, A.D. who turned 18 on October 10, 2005 (i.e. the conduct as alleged 
occurred when A.D. was between 16 yrs 9+ months and 17 yrs 364 days old). Mr. 
Epstein, pursuant to a plea agreement, entered his plea on June 30, 2008. His sentence 
which included a period of incarceration and a consecutive period of community control 
which — concluded on July 21, 2010. Mr. Epstein, even before concluding his Florida 
sentence, filled out , and presented the registration forms to Detctive rOdriguez at the 
Somu in New York City. on May 20, 2010 because of his New York City home, his 
Florida conviction, and the standards for "residence" contained in the SORNA guidelines 
for sex offender registration. 
On July 19, 2010, prior to Mr. Epstein's leaving the State of Florida, my colleague 
Kimberly Homan Esq, spoke briefly with you regarding Mr. Epstein, and ascertaining that 
the State of New York does not have a notification requirement for travel. .Upon arriving 
in New York for a short stay, Mr Epstein, accompanied by attorney Darren K Indyke, met 
with Sargeant Andrea Herzberg and PO Williams at the Sex Offender Monitoring Unit of 
the New York Police Dept (314 West 40th St) on July 23, 2010 in the morning. Mr. 
Epstein was informed at that meeting that the Divsion of Criminal Justice Services in 
Albany had Mr. Epstein in its system, and had requested that his counsel advise the 
Division regarding how frequently Mr. Epstein intended to be at his New York City home. 
As a result, Mr. Epstein and Mr. Indyke requested that I communicate in writing with you 
so that Mr. Epstein can receive authoritative advice as to whether his prior offense and his 
pan time residence in New York meets the criteria for state registration. It is Mr. 
Epstein's intention to be in New York for _no more that ten days at a time. , 
days in 
the coming year (July 27, 2010-July 26, 2011). He would keep a detailed log of each day 
he was in New York and if the days exceeded 10 he would immediately present himself for 
registration.
