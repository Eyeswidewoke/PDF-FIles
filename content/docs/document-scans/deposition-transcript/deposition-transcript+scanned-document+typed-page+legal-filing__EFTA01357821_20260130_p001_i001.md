QEP Resources 
Relative value 
QEP Resources (QEP) divested its midstream business in October 2014 for 52.5 
billion, and before it could make any major decisions on rewarding 
shareholders from the sale proceeds, oil prices cratered. 
Thanks to this 
fortuitous timing, QEP is starting off the current commodity cycle on strong 
financially footing - net leverage levels pro forma for the transaction are 0.6x 
(the lowest within the peer group along with XEC) and liquidity is an 
impressive 83.2 billion including $1.4 billion in cash (the company paid down 
-$900 million of revolver borrowings and unsecured term loan). While QEP 
scores over its BB-peers in terms of financial risk, the outlook for business risk 
is relatively less attractive. Specifically, QEP lacks high quality assets with 
significant scale (i.e. lower inventory life) comparable to peers like RRC and 
NFX; its Bakken acreage is only 109K net acres of which the top quality South 
Antelope acreage is just 27K net acres. The issue was only partially addressed 
by its minor Permian acquisition in late 2013 (26.5K net acres). Consequently, 
it is difficult to see any credit catalysts in the horizon for the company driving a 
meaningful improvement in credit profile from current levels. 
We 
acknowledge that, given its strong financial position, management could 
attempt to remedy the situation via another major acquisition of high quality 
assets and that, given the current condition of the asset markets, could even 
get it at an attractive valuation. But, at this stage, it is too early to factor this 
into the credit outlook. In terms of financial outlook, we see a modest 
deterioration from current levels over the next two years driven by weakening 
earnings and modest cash burn. We expect annual capex to be about $1.4 
billion (versus $1.7 billion in FY 14E) driving production growth in the high 
single digits. However, EBITDA levels should be in the $1.2 billion range for 
both years, below $1.3 billion in FY 14E (pro forma for divestitures) due to 
weaker realization. In turn, we see cumulative FCF burn of $550 million during 
the next two years and net leverage moving up to 1.3x by FYE 16. The 
company's hedge program is fairly modest - 25% of FY 15E production and 
close to 0% for FY 16E - exposing it to downside in commodity prices. Taking 
all of the above into account, we are moving to a SE I I. from a HOLD on all 
QEP bonds (YTVV: 6.3-6.5% on longer-dated bonds). Overall, given their recent 
outperformance, BB high yield E&P bonds have significantly outperformed -
QEP included. Further, given our shorter outlook for oil in 1H 15, we think we 
will see further weakness in overall E&P bonds before we see any marked 
improvement; we think this leaves BBs without catalysts as set to 
underperform, of which QEP is one. Upside risks include using cash on hand 
to pay down debt while downside risks include potential levering acquisitions.
