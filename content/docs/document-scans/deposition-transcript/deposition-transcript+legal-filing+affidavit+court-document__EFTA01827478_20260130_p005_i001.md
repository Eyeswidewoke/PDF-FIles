South Padre Island Development is on the right side of history in that it offers 
good value, in warm weather. on the water for middle-class pre-retirement, 
retirement buyers, however, with the housing crisis we only sold 21 houses in 
2008 and are doing only slightly better than that in 2009. Therefore, the cash 
flow is not coming from South Padre to Landmark, but cash is going from 
Landmark to South Padre. Recently there was some sign of optimism, but in 
the short run, this may be a false spring. In the long run, I am confident that 
offering homes in a good golf course community from $135,000 up will be in 
the heart of the baby boomers retirement plan. 
Apes Hill Club is 470 acres that overlooks both the west coast of the 
Caribbean and the east cost of the Atlantic. It has been the most successful 
and highest quality development I have ever been associated with. While at the 
present time, with the pound low against the dollar and the financial crisis in 
England and Ireland at its zenith, our sales are slow, last year Apes Hill Club 
made $33 million net profit. However, because the cash flow was needed for 
continued development in Apes Hill, none of the money was brought back to 
Landmark. 
Obviously, if we have a completely integrated management staff and presently 
no income from our two major developments, we have a cash flow problem. A 
year ago I believed that recession was on us, things would be bad, and 
Landmark would be (if I could keep the team together) in an ideal position to 
take advantage of the greatest financial crisis in my lifetime. Therefore, I made 
the decision not to cut management back to what was necessary for Barbados 
and South Padre, but to use it to look for new opportunities and to be 
prepared to become a major player when the market foreclosed on what I 
knew would be billions of dollars of distressed assets. 
This year we have entered into a contract for the development of a distressed 
golf project in St. Lucia. We have reached agreement with the government of 
St. Kitts to start up, again, a resort project on the west coast of St. Kitts that 
had been abandoned because of mismanagement and corruption, and we are at 
the contact stage of entering into agreement on a 5,000 acre development in 
North Carolina where the owners need management and they need the ability 
to attract some money on a last-in, first-out basis, and we are closely following 
a half dozen other distressed properties. 
In order to meet our negative cash requirements, we have exhausted our cash 
reserve, we have scrambled where possible, and I have borrowed over $1 
million personally and put it into the company. A few months ago, a 
government bank for the eastern Caribbean, originally started by the World 
Bank, agreed to loan Landmark $5 million. The security for the loan would be 
the 100% of the St. Lucia company that owns one-third of Apes Hill Club in 
Barbados. That one-third interest is worth somewhere between $20 million 
and $50 million; however, it is not the type of security that you can leverage in 
the U.S. I am told that this loan has been approved by the Board of Directors
