US Fixed Income Weekly 
shown in our last report. issuers in many important EM domiciles. such as 
Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, and Turkey have more than half of 
their total debt denominated in external currencies. predominantly in USD. It is 
also important to keep in mind that China's corporates have the lowest 
external debt burden of all major EM countries, at less than 20%. The focus 
thus should not be just China, but a potential for spillovers to the rest of EM. 
Finally, we have suggested that some EM IG commodity names are still trading 
tight, in our opinion, given the prevailing macro environment. Following the 
market repricing last week, all these names are now trading meaningfully 
wider, including Pemex at 255bp (+25bp), Ecopetrol at 375 (+15), Vale at 310 
(+20), Codelco at 235 (+20). While we view this move as one in the right 
direction, it still falls short of where it needs to be in this environment. In all 
cases, these EM names are trading roughly in line with US-domiciled issuers in 
the same industries with similar leverage, something that is unsustainable 
longer-term, in our opinion. We note that EM oil names have traded wider in 
the past week even in the face of a net 15% rebound in oil prices. 
Additionally, three largest Brazilian banks - Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, and 
ITAU - are all trading in the 450-500bp spread range, while all being 
technically rated as IG at this point . We view these levels as incompatible with 
being IG in the longer run, particularly for a financial institution, relying heavily 
on its ability to access capital markets. 
Volatility risk premix 
Because the VIX has breached a level of 30 so rarely over the past decade, we 
looked to expand the number of recent historical parallels to last week's equity 
market shock through an alternative measure of implied vol relative to the level 
of volatility actually experienced in the market over the prior year. What we 
find is that such shocks tend to involve an extended period of market 
choppiness that runs its course over a period measured in weeks and months, 
not in days. 
The implied-vs-realized vol measure is considered to be a proxy for the 
volatility risk premium that rises and falls based upon investor risk version and 
expectations that volatility might break out from trend levels. In the years 
leading up to the financial crisis of 2008, for example, realized volatility was 
substantially lower than it is today, which created a lower threshold for implied 
volatilities to signal extreme levels of investor fear. Similarly, amid the 
choppiness of the equity markets during the period immediately after the 2008 
financial crisis, implied volatilities remained high on an absolute basis but were 
actually lower than the trend at the time, suggesting an improvement of 
market conditions. 
Looking most recently, implied volatility on three-month, at-the-money SPX 
options reached a level that was nearly double the level of realized volatility 
over the past 12 months, and has since settled into a 50% premium. The table 
shown here lists the ten prior episodes when the ratio of 3m ATM implied to 
12m realized volatility exceeded 1.5x. as well as the number of days that 
implied vols remained above the equity market performance over the episode. 
(We measure equity performance beginning a week before the day when the 
vol risk premium rose above 1.5x against the low print on the S&P 500 over 
the episode.) One observation is that these episodes are associated with an 
average decline in the S&P index of 12%, or if the 2007-8 crisis episodes are
