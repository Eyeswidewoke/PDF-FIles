When booking concierge services for Card Members, American Express uses a third party concierge service 
contractor ("Concierge Company"). In some cases, Concierge Company will provide you with certain 
information about the service provider(s) fulfilling your concierge service. The actual decision to use any 
service provider referred by Concierge Company and/or American Express is the responsibility of each Card 
Member. Concierge Company and American Express strongly recommend that you carefully consider each 
service provider before choosing to use that provider. Service providers are not employees or agents of 
Concierge Company or American Express, and are not authorized to act on behalf of Concierge Company or 
American Express in any way. The Card Member accepting and utilizing a service provider acknowledges that 
Concierge Company and/or American Express are in no way responsible for the actions of the service provider 
used by the Card Member, and expressly understands and agrees that the exclusive remedy for any claims 
relating to services or products provided by the service provider (including, but not limited to negligence or 
failure to deliver on the terms of any contract between the service provider and the Card Member) is against 
the service provider and not against Concierge Company and/or American Express. Concierge Company 
and/or American Express shall not be liable for loss, damage, or other claim with respect to any services or 
products provided to Card Member by service provider. Service provider rates and availability are subject to 
change.
