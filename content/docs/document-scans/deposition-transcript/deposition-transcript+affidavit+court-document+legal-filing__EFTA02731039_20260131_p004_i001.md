Corroboration of Victim-1 
Corroboration of Victim-I's account exists through contemporaneous records, as well 
as through other victims we have already approached. We also expect to develop additional 
corroboration through interviews of victims we plan as well as likely through additional victims 
we expect to approach immediately after the investigation is overt, i.e., after charging. 
In our review of the evidence from the initial investigation, we have identified a written 
phone message that was obtained from a trash pull from Epstein's Florida residence. The message 
is from a 646 area code, and the person listed is Victim-I's first name, 
Victim-1 
does not recognize the phone number, and has told us she cycled throug manydifferent phones 
when she was a teenager, but contemporaneous phone records of an associate of Victim-1 reflect 
tolls with the 646 number, which strongly suggests the 646 number was being used by Victim-1. 
With respect to corroborating witnesses, two individuals who were introduced to 
Epstein by Victim-1 and were paid by Epstein to perform erotic massages ("Individual-1" and 
"Individual-2," respectively) were interviewed in connection with the prior Florida investigations. 
In those interviews, Individual-1 stated that when she was approximately 18, she met Victim-1 
(known to her only by first name) through a mutual friend. Victim-1 told Individual-1 she knew 
a man named Jeffrey who would pay girls $300 for massages. Victim-1 made an appointment for 
Individual-1 to go to Epstein's house, which she did. After Individual-1 was brought to Epstein's 
massage room, he asked her to strip down to her underwear and massage him; Individual-1 agreed 
only to strip down to a shirt and underwear. 
Individual-1 massaged Epstein's back for 
approximately 20 minutes before Epstein got off the table, handed her $300, and told her he did 
not want her to massage him again, because she reminded him of his niece, and that he wanted her 
to bring him other girls instead. 
Individual-1 recalls that later she and Victim-1 brought 
Individual-2 to Epstein's house to perform a massage. Individual-1 recalled bringing Individual-2 
approximately two additional times, and recalled receiving calls from "Leslie" regarding 
scheduling. Individual-2 generally confirmed this account, telling FBI agents that during massages 
with Epstein she removed her clothes and he masturbated in front of her. She said Epstein 
attempted to use a vibrator on her, but she refused. Individual-2 confirmed that Victim-1 (known 
to her only by first name) and Individual-1 had recruited her to give massages to Epstein. 
The case agents in our investigation have approached Individual-1 and Individual-2, 
both of whom preferred not to speak to law enforcement at this time and emphasized that they 
believed they were 18 years old during the relevant time period. However, while they would not 
be considered statutory victims given their age at the time, if called to testify they could corroborate 
that Victim-1 worked as a recruiter for Epstein as a minor. To our knowledge, Victim-1 has not 
spoken to Individual-1 or Individual-2 in the many years since they each interacted with Epstein. 
Victim-I also has described Epstein's Upper East Side residence in great detail, 
including describing the artwork in the massage room, a stuffed dog in the living room, and a 
library that she compared to the one in "Beauty and the Beast." It would be extraordinarily unlikely 
that Victim-1 could describe these aspects of the residence in such detail if she had not spent 
significant time there. Finally, the account from Victim-1 is nearly identical to that of another 
victim who became a recruiter for Epstein in Florida ("Victim-2"), with whom Victim-1 has had 
no contact or communications. Victim-2 is further described below.
