US Overview 
• 
There are plenty of minefields out there but none are likely to dominate 
what we still think for now is a powerful rational that warrants the current 
term structure. Long rates are well defined by low to negative term 
premium and a low terminal Funds rate. While we still see plenty of 
reasons why the Fed struggles to lift off making it as hard as it always has 
been to make money on shorting front rates to say a 3 month forward 
horizon. 
There are reasonable risk reward trades that we like including using bullish 
rate views to buy cheap risk on protection e.g. on SPX. We also for choice 
rather receive the market than pay it based on term premium staying very 
negative (Europe) but also the risk of some softer US data. This would 
favor curve caps and some relief steepening. Volatility should be higher in 
the front end relative to the back end. 
The round out for 2014 GDP data was fascinating because like Rip Van 
Winkle after 5 years of would be accelerating recovery, we realize that 
there has been no acceleration - for five years! A rock solid dullness of sub 
4 percent nominal growth. And everyone is so afraid of inflation! More 
importantly it clearly justifies the low terminal funds rate that the market is 
pricing as it leaves as many questions unanswered in terms of productivity 
and profits especially. 
• 
We look at the potential for Japanese financial sector demand for overseas 
securities to pick up in 2015 and conclude there is up to 5200 billion to 
come based on dollar yen moving to 130 and recent sensitivities of asset 
allocation decisions as well as pre-announced pension asset reallocations. 
• 
Historically, consistent bullish flattening of 10s30s has increased the 
probability of falling CPI y/y inflation over the subsequent six months. Bull 
flattening was pervasive enough to suggest an elevated risk of falling 
inflation following November, December, and January, and the indicator is 
hovering around "true" levels at present. 
• 
The median bond fund manager will likely finish the first quarter being 
close to flat to the benchmark. Our excess returns model and SMRA 
survey responses show that portfolio managers have reduced their 
exposure to corporate bonds and increased allocation into Treasuries. 
Still Play the Range 
Markets seem choppy without a lot of direction. Investors in general seem 
more occupied with long Eurostoxx, Nikkei and the still the dollar although 
since the Fed, the "handover" of dollar strength from Europe led to Fed led is 
undermining. In rates while everyone "wants" higher rates, we are of the view 
that the market isn't going anywhere and the range should continue to be 
traded. Our bias is still to buy dips rather than sell rallies. We also think 
investors should be more convinced not to short the front end. It didn't help 
you in the rally and it probably won't help you in a rangy market. This suggests 
carry trades and curve caps are more attractive now than before, relative to 
outright duration plays.
