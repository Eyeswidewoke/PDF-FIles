CRN 6685 Sec A 
`Digital labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory • [Tracks M & CI This course explores the 
shift of labOr markets to the intenet where the distinction between work, leisure, communication, 
and play has faded. In the midst of the worst financial crisis in living memory, the Internet has 
become a simple-tejoin, anyonecan-play system where digital labor generates profits and data for 
a small number of commercial and governmental stakeholders. Newly gained freedoms and 
visions of empowerment for the digital (social) worker have complex social costs that often go 
unnoticed. The course examines the violence of participation through the lens of examples of 
waged and unwaged practices including Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk. Txteagle. and 
Crowdflower). We'll study milestones of labor struggles in the United States and implicate recent 
exploitative forms of digital labor as a grievous affront to these difficult struggles for the &hour 
workday. minimum wages. paid vacation, and against child labor. Beyond an analysis of the 
situation of digital labor, the class will formulate a specific course of action. Readings include 
Aneesh. Tronti. Virno. Lazzarato, Dibbell. Vercellone Doctorov, von Hippel. and Terranova. Films 
include Sleep Dealer and Golden Times. Two research papers, one presentation, and a final paper 
are required. [Tracks M & CI

*Screening Medusa: The Limits of Representation* (Tracks S. C & MI How do we represent 
something that, by definition, is unrepresentable? This course uses the myth of the Medusa to 
approach a variety of issues concerning the problems associated with looking in cinema and other 
visual media, including medusan ekphrastic poetry. the representation of women and violence. 
and the notion of forbidden and excessive images. In addition to surveying critical approaches to 
the study of gender and sexuality, including psychoanalytic and feminist film theory, genre. and 
studies of gender and sexuality in relation to race, nation, and technology, the course uses the 
Medusa myth as a lens to test, critique, and expand scholarly discourses in film studies, art 
history, and theories of gender. How. for example, might psychoanalysis have developed differently 
if it had taken Medusa instead of Oedipus as its foundational myth? What does Medusa offer in 
the consideration of monstrous women, from film noirs femmes fatales to the vengeful female 
ghosts of J-horror? How does the moment of Medusa's decapitation cause us to examine the 
intersection of vision and violence in contemporary media, both fictive and documentary? And. 
how might Medusa's body, or the woman's body in generalliboth as a sight to behold and a site of 
lookingUoffer different ways of thinking representational possibility? Examination of visual media 
is key to the course and students are expected to contribute posts and images to the course Nog 
for collective analysis. [Tracks S. C & MJ

CRN 5798 Sec A 
*Mind Games and Puzzle Films* [Track SI Recent years have seen a surprising number of films 
gaining both popularity and critical acclaim which leave the spectators baffled, confused and 
unsure of whether what they saw was on the screen or in their minds. Films like Memento, The 
Sixth Sense. A Beautiful Mind, Bin-hp, The Life of Pi, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. 
Donnie Darko. Lost Highway. Mulholland Drive and many others, feature convoluted plots and 
labyrinthine narratives, characters that seem neither alive nor dead, and visuals (whether 
generated digitally or shot on actual locations) that are as spellbindingly seductive as they are 
deceptive or indecipherable. 
A number of books have begun to investigate these films, focusing 
on parallel worlds, forking path narratives and puzzling storytelling. The course will examine and 
explore the complexities of these new cinematic fictional worlds. It will ask what can account for 
this interest in multiple storyli nes, and why do audiences enjoy being challenged in their 
perception of what is real, imagined or purposely misleading? If the impact of digital media is 
clearly one of the reasons, do these films also tell us something about the effects of social 
networks on interpersonal interaction and the ways we perceive the world? (Track SI

*Symbolic Struggles: Culture Conflict and Consensus in the United States* (Track C) This course 
explores the dynamics of culture and power that have shaped social conflict and social consensus 
in the United States over the last sixty years. Labels such as Liberal. Neoconservative. Feminist, 
Communitarian. Multiculturalism. and identity Politics are ways in which political and social 
concerns (e.g.. over racial and gender equality, *gay marriage: and abortion) are commonly 
interpreted. In addition to clarifying the meaning of these labels, course readings are drawn from 
contributors to public debates that lie at the intersection of culture and politics as well as 
sociological analyses of these debates. 'Track CI
