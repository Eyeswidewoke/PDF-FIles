Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no discretionary distribution of 
income or principal of any trust hereunder shall be applied to pay for medical care, residential 
facilities, or any other care or service that would otherwise be provided for any Beneficiary 
hereunder by any federal, state, or other governmental agency; and no such discretionary 
distribution of income or principal shall be made for reimbursement for any such care, facilities 
or services previously provided. Before making any discretionary payment to or for the benefit 
of any such Beneficiary hereunder, my Trustees shall consider the amounts such Beneficiary is 
or may be entitled to receive from any governmental agency for such care, facilities, or services. 
If such amounts are available, discretionary distributions of income and principal from any trust 
hereunder shall be made only to supplement such amounts, and to provide liberally for needs 
and comforts over and above the basic maintenance, support, and medical care that may be paid 
for by any such agency. 
Section 5.7. - Division and Combination of Trusts 
A. 
For any administrative, tax or other purpose determined by my Trustees 
to be in the best interests of any Beneficiary (including any remainderman) hereunder, my 
Trustees may at any time and from time to time (whether before or after funding), without 
approval of any court, divide any trust under this Agreement into two or more separate trusts or 
combine two or more trusts with substantially identical terms (whether or not such trusts resulted 
from division of a prior trust). 
B. 
If property is directed to be added to any trust hereunder (the "Original 
Trust"), whether by the terms of this Agreement any other agreement, or the Will of any person, 
my Trustees may hold such property as one or more separate trusts on terms identical to the 
terms of the Original Trust. My Trustees may allocate such property among the separate trusts 
(if any) into which the Original Trust was divided, whether or not pro-rata, using specific 
assets or undivided interests therein (including allocation of all such property to one of such separate 
trusts). 
C. 
Any time during the existence of separate trusts created by division of a 
trust hereunder, my Trustees may exercise all discretionary powers differently with respect to 
the separate trusts and take all other actions consistent with such trusts being separate entities. 
Furthermore, the holder of any power of appointment with respect to such separate trusts may 
exercise such power differently with respect to each such trust. 
Section 5.8. - Consolidation of Trusts 
If at any time after my death there is in existence a trust under my Will or any trust 
agreement created by me having identical beneficiaries and substantially the same terms as any 
trust under this Agreement, my Trustees may terminate the trust hereunder and transfer the 
assets thereof to the Trustees of such other trust, to be administered by the Trustees thereof. 
Different termination dates under the applicable Rule Against Perpetuities shall not be deemed 
a difference in the terms of such trusts, but the portion of the trust representing the transferred 
assets shall retain the same termination date as the original trust.
