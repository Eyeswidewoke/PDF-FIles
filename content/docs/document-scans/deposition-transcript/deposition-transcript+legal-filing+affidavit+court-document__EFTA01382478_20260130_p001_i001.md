Stock-Based Employee Compensation Safeway accounts for all share-based payments to employees, including grants of 
employee stock options, as compensation cost based on the fair value on the date of grant. The Company determines fair value of such 
awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions, such as 
risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of options, in order to arrive at a fair value estimate. 
New Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2014. the Financial Accounting Standards Board (TAM") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, 
"Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard's core principle is that a 
company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration 
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The 
Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU No. 2014.09 on its financial statements. 
On April 10, 2014. the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08 "Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of 
Components of an Entity? ASU No. 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure 
requirements. The new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim 
periods within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently assessing the future impact of ASU 
No. 2014-08 on its financial statements.
