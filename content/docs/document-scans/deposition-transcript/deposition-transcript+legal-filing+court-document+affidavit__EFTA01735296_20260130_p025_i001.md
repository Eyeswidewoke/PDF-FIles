6 The wholly improper intervention by the Swedish Prime Minster whipping up further 
vilification of Mr Assange as an enemy of the Swedish State. 
Points 1, 4 and 6 relate essentially to the same issue — disclosure of information inappropriately and publicly in 
an unfair way. It has also been suggested that the complainant's lawyer in Sweden has made inappropriate 
remarks. Miss Montgomery suggested that any comments from the Swedish Prime Minister may have been a 
response to comments made publicly on the steps of this court by the defence team here. I have heard no 
evidence that the defence team has publicly commented to the media, and so cannot say that that has happened. 
Certainly the conventional wisdom is that prosecutors, lawyers and politicians are best advised not to comment 
on a case until it is over. Sometimes public comment damages the cause more than it helps. However the reality 
is that such comments do occur. In this country police officers do comment on an investigation. Confidential 
information is sometimes leaked. Politicians may speak inappropriately. Defence lawyers do sometimes brief 
the press. It is not possible for me to measure the impact of any such disclosures in this case. However I think 
it highly unlikely that any comment has been made with a view to interfere with the course of public justice. It is 
more likely that comments have been made with the intention of protecting reputations, including the reputation 
of the Swedish justice system. Moreover, I am absolutely satisfied that no such comments will have any impact 
on the decisions of the courts, either here or in Sweden. I know that there will be three lay judges in any trial in 
Sweden. Despite the suggestion that they are selected because of their political allegiances, there is simply no 
reason to believe that they will not deal with the case on the evidence before them. Any earlier impression of the 
merits of the case, whether favourable or unfavourable to this defendant, will play no part. In this jurisdiction 
we have ample experience of defendants who have been vilified and yet acquitted. The jury system (and if I may 
say so the summary system) is robust. The defence has referred me to one case (McCann, Cullen and 
Shanahan) where a politician made comments that were later considered by the Court of Appeal to have had 
such a potentially prejudicial effect that the verdict of guilty recorded in the trial had to be overturned. However 
that was in relation to a comment about the right to silence made during final speeches of a trial where the 
defendants elected not to give evidence at the trial itself. I am not in a position to say whether any comments 
made by the police and a prosecutor arc unlawful in Sweden. One of the witnesses said they were unfair but not 
illegal. They would not necessarily be illegal here. The position may be different once a prosecution has actually 
commenced, as opposed to during the investigation. 
As for point 2, there is nothing in that. As I understand it, there is a similar process in this country whereby 
aggrieved complainants can ask the CPS to reconsider a decision not to prosecute. Such a process dots not 
demand the participation of a suspect. Complainants can also instigate a private prosecution. In Sweden it is 
clear chat a suspect also has an opportunity to give an explanation in interrogation before a charge is preferred. 
As for point 3, the evidence is that Ms Ny contacted the defence on 21th September requesting an early interview. 
The date suggested for interview was 28th September. It is a matter of some surprise that the defendant was not 
contactable during the relevant time by his lawyer. However the prosecution cannot be blamed for that. In any 
event Swedish procedure is far from universal. Our own process does not envisage that any such questioning 
will take place within a matter of weeks. Perhaps the Swedish system is superior to ours in that way, but failing
