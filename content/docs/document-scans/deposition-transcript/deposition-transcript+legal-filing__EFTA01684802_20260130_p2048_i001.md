www.americanewess oom Finance Charges: Avenge Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance 
Charges (FC): We use the ADB Method to calculate Ft ons
ur Account Under this method we figure the FC on your 
Account by applying the Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature (including current 
transactions); Different daily periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADS Tor each 
feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous billing periods) (2) add any 
new transactions, debts, or Tem-, ('3) subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each 
day after Me finit day of Me billing penod we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous days dailqoalance 
mullphed by the DPR for the Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the 
mning 
balance for that Feature for the next day. If this balances negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up aft t 
day
balances for the Feature for the bang period and divide the total by the number of days in the baling period. This gives 
us the ADB for the Feature. If you pay the New Balance on this statement by the next Oosing Date, then you will avoid 
additional FC on features included in this New Balance. If you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in 
the billing period and the DPR for that Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations 
caused by rounding. The total FC for the bang period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of 
the Account This method of calculating the ADS and FC results in daily compounding of FC. Transactions 
Made in Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a foreign currency, it will be converted into US dollars 
on the date it is processed by us or our agents Unless a particular rate is required by applicable law, we will 
choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date Currently, the conversion rate we use for a Charge 
in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a government 
agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by us from costemary banking sources, on the 
conversion date or the prior business day In each instance Increased by 2.7%. This conversion rate may differ from 
rates in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates 
such estabishments use. Billing Rights Summary: In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill: If you think your 
bill is incorrect or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet of paper at 
the Customer Service address noted to the right. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bA
