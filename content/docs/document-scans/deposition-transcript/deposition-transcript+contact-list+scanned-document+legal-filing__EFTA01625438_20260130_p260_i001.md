PROCEEDINGS 
MR HOROWITZ: Adam Horowitz, counsel for 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe 4. 
MR. CRITION: Cindy, what time is it? 
THE COURT REPORTER: It is 1.03. 
MR. BERGER: William J. Eager for LM and 
EW. 
MR. HILL Jack Hill for CMA. 
MR_ LANGINO: Adam Langino from 
Leopold KUVill on behalf of BB. 
MR. LUITIER: Mark Luttier on behalf of 
Busman, Critton, Luttier & Coleman for the 
Defendant. 
MR_ CRITION: Robert Onion on behalf of 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein. 
MR. HOROWITZ: This is Adam Horowitz. 
We're canceling today's deposition. Before 
appearing here today, we bad a stipulation with 
Defense counsel that Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, the 
Defendant, would not be hat. He would not 
cross paths with our client. 
And immediately as we were approaching the 
deposition mom, he made face-to-face contact 
with ota client. He was just feet away from 
Page 5 
her and intimidated her, and for that mason 
we're not going forward. 
MR. CRTITON: I didn't see any contact 
because I, obviously, was not out there. We 
started at about — when you came in it was 
approximately 1:03. Mr. Epstein has an office 
here at the Florida Science Foundation. Had 
you been here at 1:00, your paths never would 
have crossed because Mr. Epstein was leaving 
the building I instructed him to leave the 
building so that he would not be here. 
He was going to appear by way of Skype so 
that he could be on a video camera so that he 
could see this. 
(Mr. Goldberger entered the toorn.) 
MR. CRHTON: Had you been here on time, 
and not faulting, I am just saying had you been 
here on time at 1:00, as everyone else seemed 
to be here at least get here before you did, 
Adam, you and your client, your paths never 
would have crossed. 
I directed Mr. Epstein to leave the 
building so he would not be here so that there 
would be no way that your paths could have 
crossed. It was neither my intent nor was it
