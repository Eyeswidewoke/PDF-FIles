Re: 
you should read your own e mails... // first the smirk comes from the fa=t that managin the staff schedules. is the most 
trivial of tasks, not a re=ponsibility. if done correctly it takes no longer than 30 minutes a day.=A0 , It is not what I need 
or want. , it is not what i asked you to do,=but what you think you should do... i wasn't asking you if you thought=dana 
made sense, I was merely telling you what i am doing. the recitati=n of what i had done , confirmed that the assoistance 
i had previoulsy =sk you for, can be accomplished in three hours. ) still no office chair, =ut i will go myself today).. IT is 
silly, you say get back to real 
you mean your life. I have kept my promise toyou. the atmo=phere in the house 
is unsustainable. Henry jarecki came with his entourage= the help i talk about is not scheduling igor, but being a friend 
and h=lping making things PLEASANT COMFORTABLE, EASY. in this regard I =eed say no more. I will take full, 
blame.however =-. I CAN"=T live with anyone in my house full time. it has little to do with you, =1 sent you a famous 
essay on its difficulties, so that a dead person could=explain it.

I already told you what I thought would help but you dismissed it with a sm=rk. I asked you for more

I tried to explain to you when you just ask me to run one errand I try t= get it over with as quicly as I can so I can

This is the same suggestion I have been making for a l000ng time now but yo= ignore it every time and end the 
argument with the same 'I don't =ctually need you to do anything as long as you are never in a bad mood'. That works 
until you forget about it, start comparing me to your employee=, call me selfish, then I get in a bad mood and the cycle 
starts again.. H=w about you actually let me do it this time. Sarah is leaving so I have 3 =eeks to 'play. 
I am already reducing my man-oh-foldover pressure and my flaps are coming u=. 
I can't remember what else you were unhappy about, remind me. 
That's very nice of simona to bicycle to your house that early and make=you breakfast. I am sure it is very tasty. 
Your last email makes no sense to me if it is not meant simply as complaini=g and giving me a list of your and 
your employees errands today compared t= my not being there. I must be reading it wrong, I don't know what you=are 
trying to say.. 
-Dana 'assisting Simona' doesn't make much sense next week sinc= I will already be there with z on saturday. I 
don't understand why yo= included that in the email.
