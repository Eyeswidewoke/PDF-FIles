Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Tabk of Contents 
SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Revenue Recognition Retail store sales are recognized at the point of sale. Sales tax is excluded from revenue. Internet sales 
are recognized when the merchandise is delivered to the customer. Discounts provided to customers in connection with loyalty cards are 
accounted for as a reduction of sales. 
Safeway records a deferred revenue liability when it sells Safeway gift cards. Safeway records a sale when a customer redeems 
the gift card. Safeway gift cards do not expire. The Company reduces the liability and increases other revenue for the unused portion of 
gift cards ("breakage") after two years, the period at which redemption is considered remote. Breakage amounts were $1.8 million, $1.9 
million and $1.8 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold includes cost of inventory sold during the period, including purchase and distribution 
costs. These costs include inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, warehouse inspection costs, warehousing costs and 
other costs of Safeway's distribution network. All vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods when earned. 
Advertising and promotional expenses are also included as a component of cost of goods sold. Such costs are expensed in the period 
the advertisement occurs. Advertising and promotional expenses totaled $325.5 million in 2014, $371.6 million in 2013 and $415.9 
million in 2012. 
Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months and 
credit and debit card sales transactions which settle within a few business days of year end. 
There were no book overdrafts included in accounts payable at year-end 2014. At year-end 2013, book overdrafts of $84.5 million 
were included in accounts payable. 
Receivables Receivables include pharmacy and miscellaneous trade receivables. 
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventory of $1,755.3 million at year-end 2014 and $1,643.2 million at year-end 2013 is 
valued at the lower of cost on a last-in, first-out ("LIFO") basis or market value. Such LIFO inventory had a replacement or current cost of 
$1,808.4 million at year-end 2014 and $1,701.3 million at year-end 2013. Liquidations of LIFO layers during the three years reported did 
not have a material effect on the results of operations. The remaining inventory consists primarily of perishables, pharmacy and fuel 
inventory. Perishables are counted every four weeks and are carried at the last purchased cost or the last four-week average cost, which 
approximates first-in, first-out ("FIFO") cost. Pharmacy and fuel inventories are carried at the last purchased cost, which approximates 
FIFO cost. The Company records an inventory shrink adjustment upon physical counts and also provides for estimated inventory shrink 
adjustments for the period between the last physical inventory and each balance sheet date. 
Property and Depreciation Property is stated at cost. Depreciation expense on buildings and equipment is computed on the 
straight-line method using the following lives: 
Stores and other buildings 
Fixtures and equipment 
7 to 40 years 
3 to 15 years 
Safeway capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred during the application development 
stage as part of fixtures and equipment. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
