See below. Moved him back to where we were before the hysteria. Notion of no firing for cause and that 
he's guaranteed employment for 29 mos obviously off the table. He knows he needs our final sign-off 
tuesday. Obviously, "deadline" gone; but he had to reject other job.... 
What a mess; but for the time being I think we're better with him than without him....

just want to close the loop with Idb which I can do tuesday. For your own protection I'd string out 
the rsm guys until early next week until lean and I can talk 
Rich, you're a good man; don't forget that!

» I want to have a job until my kids turn 18. 29 month. If I get fired from family office with out cause in 
6 months I want to continue to work somewhere say Apollo tax. I'd like to get paid until end of 29 
months. after that, standard severance. 12 months. 6 min minimum. I don't want to be fired in 5 
months and have disincentive not to work.

out the mitigation clause below and you have a 29mos contract and no less than 12 mos severance, I 
believe that's what you're requesting and something I believe we can do. If I'm missing something pls 
send it back in an email, just because I think we both need clarity, not ambiguity. Still hoping we put 
something together that meets your needs! Thx, brad
