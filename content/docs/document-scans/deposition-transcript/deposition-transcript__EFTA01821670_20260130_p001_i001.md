"Not at all. Again, I am only saying it makes the situation surprisingly nice when you make things 
clear to these girls. The fact you think i do little and some of the requests you make are strange 
and unreasonable to me, not to you." Nadia , I have always made it clear.... however no matter 
what i say or do , people still see you and what you do or don't do. and form their opinions from 
their own lying eyes. Im not sure why you don't understand that.

about it, you showed me yesterday that I can just do the things you need because they are obviously important 
to you, even though I may not understand why. The feeling of having your needs met without a struggle is too 
nice and i certainly don't want to be the one to deprive you of it. 
I am being nice here but you choose to ignore the fact I am agreeing with you and keep attacking me, i am 
tired and i ant going to bed.

Subject Re: 
read what you have written, you honestly belive that you should have the ultimate decision on 
who i hire, who i give an apt to, who i let stay in my house. these are not your " needs" . its 
my restrictions. your previous shrinks asked what role you were going to perform as opposed 
to give excuses why you could ,would or should not.. it is still the same.. The fact that you do 
little is not strange or unreasonble to me., it is merely fact.

Yes, you have been right all along and so have I. And we can take each others needs seriously or dismiss 
them because they seem strange or unreasonable to us. 
I don't ask to make other people feel worse, just to be honest about your intentions and not lead them on and 
undermine our relationship by doing so.

you mean to ask you to actually look at your behavior is not constructive. re how you feel I just 
thought that you would endeavor to feel better. , why else would you ask for such things.. so 
you could feel worse.. maybe. ----those are the only two choices. as i said the other day,
