trial. Mitchell v. Kindred Healthcare Operating, Inc., 349 S.W.3d 492, 496 
(Tenn. Ct. App. 2008). As we observed in Rosenberg v. 
BlueCross BlueShield of Tenn., Inc., 219 S.W.3d 892, 903-04 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
2006), 
[a]s a general rule, a court's enforcement of an arbitration provision is 
reviewed de novo. See Cooper v. MRM Inv. Co., 367 F.3d 493, 
497 (6th Cir. 2004). A trial court's order on a motion to compel arbitration 
addresses itself primarily to the application of contract law. 
We review such an order with no presumption of correctness on appeal. See 
Pyburn v. Bill Heard Chevrolet, 63 S.W.3d 351, 356 
(Tenn. Ct. App. 2001); see also Nelson v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 8 S.W.3d 
625, 629 (Tenn. 1999). However, to the extent that findings 
of fact are necessary concerning the "cost-prohibitive" nature of the 
arbitration sought, these findings come to us with a presumption of 
correctness absent a preponderance of evidence to the contrary. Tenn. R. 
App. P. 13(d); T.R. Mills Contractors v. WRH Enterprises, 
LLC et al., 93 S.W.3d 861, 864 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002). 
Trigg v. Little Six Corp. 457 S.W.3d 906, 911 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2014). 
We granted this Tenn. R. App. P. 9 interlocutory appeal on the sole issue of 
whether the signature of the trustee on an 
investment/brokerage account agreement agreeing to arbitration binds the 
Minor beneficiary of the Trust to conduct arbitration of 
unknown future disputes and claims. As this Court has explained: 
Trust instruments are interpreted similarly to contracts, deeds, or 
6 
wills. Marks v. Southern Trust Co., 203 Tenn. 200, 205, 310 S.W.2d 435, 
437-38 (1958). Determining the settlor's intent is important 
and may be easily done by looking to the four corners of the trust 
instrument. Marks v. Southern Trust Co., 203 Tenn. at 205, 310 
S.W.2d at 438. Unless the trust instrument is ambiguous or allegations of 
fraud, accident or mistake have been made, parol evidence 
or evidence of surrounding facts and circumstances that contradicts or 
varies the terms of a written instrument may not be considered. 
HMF Trust v. Bankers Trust Co., 827 S.W.2d 296, 299 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991); 
Brown v. Brown, 45 Tenn. App. 78, 95, 320 S.W.2d 721, 
728 (1959). 
In re: Estate of Marks, 187 S.W.3d 21, 28 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005). With regard 
to interpretation of contracts, this Court has explained: 
In resolving a dispute concerning contract interpretation, our task is to 
ascertain the intention of the parties based upon the usual, 
natural, and ordinary meaning of the contract language. Planters Gin Co. v. 
Fed. Compress & Warehouse Co., Inc., 78 S.W.3d 885, 
889-90 (Tenn. 2002)(citing Guiliano v. Cleo, Inc., 995 S.W.2d 88, 95 (Tenn. 
1999)). A determination of the intention of the parties "is 
generally treated as a question of law because the words of the contract are 
definite and undisputed, and in deciding the legal effect of 
the words, there is no genuine factual issue left for a jury to decide." 
Planters Gin Co., 78 S.W.3d at 890 (citing 5 Joseph M. Perillo, 
Corbin on Contracts, ] 24.30 (rev. ed. 1998); Doe v. HCA Health Servs. of 
Tenn., Inc., 46 S.W.3d 191, 196 (Tenn. 2001)). The central
