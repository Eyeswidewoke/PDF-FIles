Hi there Shelley. I don't really have any interesting projects like this going, I have always just wanted to. I've been 
making small stories only for my direct family and nothing beyond that! 
I am just back from Uganda so my schedule is a little weird this week but perhaps a good thing for you to do 
might be to think about what your schedule looks like and how much you are willing to travel to try to do 
something like this. I understand that Jeffrey will be supporting you in this process, so perhaps talk to him too 
about what might be the right fit for you. 
Traveling with me is probably not a good idea because I don't really have "down" time and usually blow through 
a city slum and government offices pretty quickly - however I do have great friends and associates in many cities 
around Africa and Asia. What I envision might be for you to visit some of the world's most amazing places not as 
a tourist, but as a learner. You might spend a few days wandering around and talking to regular people and 
asking them what stories they tell their children at night and what legends have been passed on from their 
parents and grandparents. 
In Africa, it is more about tribe than country. I would suggest that you spend time in Dar, Harare, Rabat-Sole, 
Durban, Kampala, Cape Town, and maybe even Lilongwe. You'd hit several of the major tribes in these places 
and I know plenty of folks in these places that would take great care of you. Some would likely even require you 
to stay in thier homes and be part of their family. That beats a hotel any day! Asia is great too. You could do 100 
stories just in China. But I would say that Danang, Siem Reap, Rangoon, Mumbai, Kathmandu and maybe Delhi 
would offer some great tales. 
It might be fun to do three "volumes" - Asia, Africa and Latin America. You could also get fancy and do Island 
stories too...those are some of the best! Fiji, Hawaii, Madagascar, New Zealand, Vanuatu, Sri Lanka, 
Maldives...all have these wild, wild stories about how their island is the center of the universe.... 
So this is something that could consume your life! In order to see all of these cities, you would want to plan well 
in advance. Weather (storms) is usually the main thing I try to plan around. I like Africa in November-January and 
south Asia in December. China is best in the spring. The islands are always risky but usually have a solid dry 
season. To give you an example of how to budget time and money, I would say that a 10 day trip to Africa is 
about $15,000 if you stay at business (not super fancy) hotels and travel business class. A 10 day trip to Asia is 
probably a tiny bit less. You would need 5 days for each city (give yourself 2 for travel and 2-3 to hang out). 
Tourist visas generally take about 2 weeks to process unless you go stand in line at the consulate, then it's more 
like 2 days. Each one costs on avergae of 5100 USD. I can make the contacts for your visits but you will have to 
feel empowered and brave on your own too! 
Think about it a little bit and let me know...

Great to hear of your interesting projects. I'm grateful to Jeffrey for putting us in touch. Funny you mentioned the children's stories. as a 
few years back I started a publishing venture for children with a similar vision. 
I would love to talk further with you about the idea and how we might partner on the project. 
How do you suggest we best go about arranging a time to talk - when is convenient for you?
