Southern District of Florida 
June 25, 2007 
Page 12 
Florida during that time was to visit with and attend to his mother's needs, see to her funeral 
• arrangements, and address matters relating to her estate. 
In recognition of the amount of time he spent in Florida, dining the relevant period Mr. 
Epstein worked with several local real estate agents to purchase a larger home. For example, in 
2004, as publicly reported, he attempted to acquire the Gosman Estate, a unique property that 
was eventually auctioned by the Bankruptcy Court. 
Similarly, due to the extensive amount of time he spent in Florida and his desire to have 
his pilots close by and available should a flight out of Florida be required, the home base for Mr. 
Epstein's flight operations was Florida. Routine maintenance of the aircraft, periodic FAA 
inspections, and interior refittings were all carried out in Florida. Indeed, the regular crew 
members — the pilots and engineer — all resided in Florida, as did the majority of contract crew 
members who were hired from time to time. Both Hyperion Air Inc. (legal owner of Mr. 
Epstein's Gulfstream G-IIB), and JEGE, Inc. (legal owner of Mr. Epstein's Boeing 727), rent 
office space and a storage facility in Florida for the purpose of housing airplane records, 
including flight logs and wiring drawings, and providing the crew with a local office. 
The amount of time Mr. Epstein spent at his home in Florida, and the extensive list of 
Florida-based activities clearly undermines the contention that Mr. Epstein is a New York 
resident and defeats the notion that his purpose in traveling to Florida was to engage in illicit 
sexual conduct. On the contrary, Mr. Epstein returned to Florida to engage in the routine 
activities of daily living. We do not believe that the government could overcome the many 
substantial hurdles to be encountered when attempting to prove that a specific trip to Florida was 
for the required statutory "purpose" of engaging in specific "illicit sexual conduct".II
Improprieties Surrounding The Search Warrant 
We previously referred to the many irregularities, misrepresentations and omissions 
which tainted the state's case. These irregularities would have a significant impact on any 
federal prosecution. For example, early on in any prosecution, the legality of the initial search 
" There are, of mune, a number of other ways in which Mr. Epstein's conduct did not violate § 2423(6). For 
instance, we anticipate that it will be difficult to show under the facts that at the time he initiated his travel to Florida, 
be knew the woman from whom he would later receive a massage, if at all, was at the time under the age of IS, or 
that he would engage in "illicit sexual conduct" as defined by that statute. Similarly, and again assuming that it could 
be shown that one of his purposes in traveling to Florida was to receive a massage, given that the activities during 
many of the massages varied, we do not believe it can be established that his purpose (or even one of his purposes) 
in traveling was to engage in "a sex act", however that term is ultimately defined.
