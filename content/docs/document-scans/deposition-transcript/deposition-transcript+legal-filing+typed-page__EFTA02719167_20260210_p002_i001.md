The answer was remarkably low: two. 
Just two funds — the Hodges Small Cap fund and the AMG SouthernSun Small Cap fund — managed to 
hold on to their berths in the top quarter every year for five years running. And for the 2,862 funds as a 
whole, that record is even a little worse than you would have expected from random chance alone. 
In other words, if all of the managers of the 2,862 funds hadn't bothered to try to pick stocks at all — if 
they had merely flipped coins — they would, as a group, probably have produced better numbers. 
Instead of two funds at the end of five years, basic probability theory tells us there should have been 
three. 
(If you're curious, I explained how the math works in a subsequent column, "Heads or Tails? Either Way, 
You Might Beat a Stock Picker." 
The study seemed to support the considerable body of evidence suggesting that most people shouldn't 
even try to beat the market: Just pick low-cost index funds, assemble a balanced and appropriate 
portfolio for your specific needs, and give up on active fund management. 
The data in the study didn't prove that the mutual fund managers lacked talent or that you couldn't beat 
the market. But, as Keith Loggie, the senior director of global research and design at S.&P. Dow Jones 
Indices, said in an interview last week, the evidence certainly didn't bolster the case for investing with 
active fund managers. 
"looking at the numbers, you can't tell whether there is skill involved in what they do or whether their 
performance is just a matter of luck," Mr. Loggie said. "I believe that many of them do have skill. But 
even if they do have it, based on how they've done in the past you really can't predict how they will 
perform in the future." 
Still, those two funds did manage to perform splendidly in that study. 
Their stubborn persistence at the top of the heap over that five-year period suggested that there was 
some hope for active fund managers. If they could do it, after all, others could, too. 
But we're now about two weeks away from the completion of another 12 months since the end of that 
study, and it's been a mediocre stretch, at best for those two mutual funds. When the month is over, to 
borrow from Agatha Christie, it looks as though we'll be saying: And then there were none. 
Here are the dismal statistics: The SouthernSun Small Cap fund has actually lost money for investors 
over the 12 months through Thursday. It was down 3.2 percent, according to Morningstar, and for the 
nine months through December, it was in the bottom quartile of funds in the S.&P. Dow Jones study. The 
Hodges Small Cap fund has done better, gaining almost 6 percent through Thursday. S.&.P. Dow Jones 
Indices says that put it in the third quartile — or second-to-worst one — through December. While it's 
mathematically possible, it is highly unlikely that either will climb to the top quartile in the next few 
weeks, Mr. Loggie said. 
Michael W. Cook, the lead manager of the SouthernSun Small Cap fund and the founder of the firm that 
runs it, was traveling last week and was unavailable to comment for this column. Craig Hodges, manager 
of the familyrun Hodges Small Cap fund in Dallas, spoke to me on the telephone and told me that he 
wasn't surprised that his fund had stumbled. "We're not that good," he said. "It was going to happen
