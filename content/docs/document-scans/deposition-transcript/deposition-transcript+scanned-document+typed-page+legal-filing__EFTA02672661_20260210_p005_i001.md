working with Whitfield and Penzabene on Temptations material after Eddie Holland left Motown with 
the rest of the Holland-Dozier-Holland songwriting/production team in 1967. Two of the Whitfield-
Strong-Penzabene collaborations, "I Wish It Would Rain" and "I Could Never Love Another (After Loving 
You)", became hits in early 1968 after the untimely suicide of Roger Penzabene in December 1967. 
Subsequently, Barrett Strong became the sole collaborator of Norman Whitfield. 
Exit David Ruffin, enter Dennis Edwards 
From early 1964 to mid 1968, the Temptations went from unknown hopefuls to international stars and 
as a result, appeared frequently on television shows such as American Bandstand, The Ed Sullivan Show, 
and The Hollywood Palace. At the same time, the group began to achieve a crossover success, catering 
to middle America with a pop standards album (The Temptations in a Mellow Mood, 1967), the success 
of which resulted in performances at the famous Copacabana in New York City along with dates at other 
similar supper clubs. Outside of music, the Temptations were made honorary members of Phi Beta 
Sigma fraternity. 
By 1967, David Ruffin had begun demanding special treatment as lead singer, riding to and from gigs in a 
private mink-lined limousine with his then-girlfriend, Motown singer Tammi Terrell, instead of in the 
group limousine used by the other four Temptations. The other members slowly became irritated and 
annoyed with Ruffin's behavior. Following Motown's decision to rechristen The Supremes as Diana Ross 
& the Supremes, Ruffin felt entitled to the same treatment and demanded that his group be renamed as 
well, to David Ruffin & the Temptations. Ruffin was also causing friction with Berry Gordy by demanding 
an accounting of the group's earnings. 
Some of this behavior was attributed to the fact that by this time Ruffin had begun using cocaine 
regularly, building further tension within the group and causing him to miss a number of group 
meetings, rehearsals, and concerts. There was a general consensus among the rest of the group that 
Ruffin needed to be replaced. When Ruffin missed a June 1968 engagement at a Cleveland supper club 
in order to attend a show by his new girlfriend Barbara Gail Martin (daughter of Dean Martin), it was 
decided that he had crossed the line. The other four Temptations drew up legal documentation, officially 
firing Ruffin from the group on June 27, 1968. The next day, Dennis Edwards, a singer formerly of the 
Contours that Eddie Kendricks and Otis Williams already had pegged as a potential Ruffin replacement, 
was hired to take Ruffin's place. 
Edwards and Ruffin were good friends, and at first, Ruffin went along with the changing of the guard and 
encouraged Edwards. However, at Edwards' official debut with the Temptations in Valley Forge, 
Pennsylvania on July 7, Ruffin came to the show and jumped onstage, taking the microphone from 
Edwards, singing lead on "Ain't Too Proud to Beg", and disappearing as quickly as he'd appeared. Ruffin 
repeated this stunt several times throughout the group's July tour run. Despite the group hiring extra 
security to keep Ruffin out, he continued to find ways to sneak into the venue and jump onstage when 
the group performed one of the songs he once sung lead on.
