Grateful Dead in 1970. Left to righ=: Bill Kreutzmann, Ron "Pigpen" McKernan, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir= Mickey Hart, Phil

The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California under the name of The Warlocks 
but quickly change its name when it was discovered that another East Coast band (Velvet Underground) had the same 
name. The band was known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, bluegrass, blues, 
reggae, country, improvisational jazz, psychedelia,=and space rock, and for live performances of long musical 
improvisation. =i>"Their music," writes Lenny Kaye, "touches on ground that most other groups don't even know 
exists." 4)=A0 These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead 
"the pi=neering Godfathers of the jam band world". They were ranked=57th in the issue The Greatest Artists of all Time 
by Rolling Stone magazine. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall 
Concert at Cornell University (May 8= 1977) was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registr=. The 
Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. 
The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of counterculture of the 1960s. The 
founding m=mbers were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron "Pigpen" McKerna= (keyboards, 
harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzma=n (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played 
together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree=ti39;s Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. 
Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., 
who had played bass for a few g=gs. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, the core of the band stayed 
together for its entire 30-year history. Other longtime members of the band include Mickey Hart (drums 1967—=971, 
1974-1995), Keith Godchaux (keyboards 1971-1979), Donna God=haux (vocals 1972-1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, 
vocals 1979-1990), an= Vince Welnick (keyboards 1990-1995). 
The fans of the Grateful Dead, some of whom followed the band from concert to concert for years, are known as 
&qu=t;Deadheads" and are known for their dedication to the band's music. T=e band and its following (Deadheads) are 
closely associated with the hippie movement and were seen as a form of institution in the culture of America for many 
years. Former members =f the Grateful Dead, along with other musicians, toured as the Dead in 2003,2004, and 2009 
after tour=ng as the Other Ones in 1998,2000, and 2002. There are many contemporary incarnations of the Dead, with 
the most prominent touring acts being Furthu=, Phil Lesh & Friends, Bob Weir & Ratdog, and the Rhythm Devils with 
drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann. Whether they are your cup of tea or not, the Grateful Dead is definitely in 
the front row of the Pantheon of Rock & Roll and as such I invite yo= to enjoy the iconic and wonderful music of one of 
America's greats ban= and the most successful band in the world to have never had a hit record
