Dear Jeffrey, 
I simply don't know how to put it.. but your letter was like a thunderbolt for me.. 
I've been always trying to be grateful and kind to you-this is the only way I could return my 
thanks (if at all!!) for your immense kindness, generosity, help, attention and financial support... 
I'm fascinated by the way you care so much about people (wonderful example-the cello you 
bought for a young musician you barely know-and that is only one example of many many other 
amazing things you do) and I really appreciate your generosity which I hardly deserve. 
I try to express my gratitude to you in words every time we meet or text via email, but probably 
it is not properly or sufficiently done. Maybe it is because of cultural differences? I think you 
were absolutely right, when you noticed that we, Lithuanians, are shy and constrained, and do 
not loudly express our feelings. But believe me, it doesn't mean that we don't have feelings or 
are ungrateful.. 
I'm sure that this misunderstanding about music theory was my fault. I had to express myself 
more clearly and to be more concrete when we talked about it before your trip to Paris or later 
via email (when you asked me about books). I imagine how busy you are, I see how much you 
travel and how full your schedule is. In the last few weeks there were only few days that you 
stayed in NY and I believe that during that short time you were here, you had a lot of much 
more important things than music theory. Therefore, I asked if you could let me know, when 
you had some time for studying and would like to start it, so that we could schedule the time 
and meet for studying. Believe me, it would be a great honor and real pleasure to share with 
you something that I know and what is interesting to you. 
While about reading some material from the book- if you agree, I would like first to make sure 
how many things you already know, so that I could see from what point we should start. I'm 
sure that many things will be familiar to you as you have already got to know them while 
studying music before. So we could go through the first chapters and see what are the things 
we could improve. 
Once again, I strongly apologize for not being able to express myself clearly enough and make 
my gratefulness more evident. Maybe it could be partly because of language "barrier".. It is 
always easier for a person to express in native language, especially when it talks about feelings 
or emotions. Anyway, I want you to know, that I'm truly really grateful for your generosity and 
all kinds of support you give to me and I will be happy to return the kindness with sharing not 
only my knowledge in music theory, but also my violin music.
