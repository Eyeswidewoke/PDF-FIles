Yes I know and I was going but at first I had to ask when Nd what time you wanted to see her 
. I would understand if she didnt show up. A few times but it was only once and that because 
you didn't answer for too long when. She was ready to come and told me the time only two 
hours before she had to show up and she had a casting or work at this time . Jeffrey there 
some things I'm not able to control but I tried do my best you know I'm not good at making 
friends and random communications but do try and I still can bring her when you come back 
otherwise I have a view on another girl but she not cute as this and kind of crazy . And it is 
long because I need time to get know girls , choose one and get know her situation , and to 
make sure if we can truth her and she won't make a problems in a future to you

Why don't you tellme what you did do. You find it easy to ask but difficult to do things. After 
months the girl didn't show up . I give up

That's not true ! I told you thank you before and after the event and after and about the 
ballet show too but if you accept " thank you " from emails more than saying it to you in a 
face I will do it next time sorry about that than . And I tried to find you a girl and when I 
finally was ready to bring her you said you don't want and you don't need it . I don't 
understand you ... 
I never ask you money for not reasonable things I even don't ask you money for clothes and 
other staff like some girls do only important : bills, rent, school , food . At this time I had to 
ask you because you know I need money to bring w me for 8 days and presents for her 
parents ... I didnt even ask a particular amount I would appreciate any money u give and 
I'm really thankful to you for what you giving me If you think I'm asking to much let me 
know
