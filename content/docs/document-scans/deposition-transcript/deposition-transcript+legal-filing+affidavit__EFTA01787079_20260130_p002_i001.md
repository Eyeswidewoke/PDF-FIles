Rasmieh Odeh is going on trial in the United States in January a secon= time for immigration fraud. She claimed among 
other things that she did n=t commit the bombing, and that she admitted to it in the Israeli courts on=y following weeks 
of torture. 
As the Jerusalem Post reported today: 
"Most significantly, the decision means th=t Rasmea Yousef Odeh will get to argue that her confession and conviction =n 
Israel came as the result of torture by Israeli security forces - potent=ally putting the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) 
itself "on trial" in a =S court... Odeh's supporters claim that her original trial in Israel was m=rked with 'bias and 
inconsistencies,' and that Odeh confessed her involvem=nt in terrorism only after she was tortured by security 
authorities."

The following is the transcript of the interview with Aish= Odeh in which she admits to the bombing and says her 
accomplice was Rasmi=h Odeh: 
Aisha Odeh: "Immediately after the 1967 war (i.e., the Six Day War) we ch=nged [the name] from the Arab Nationalist 
Movement to the Popular Front fo= the liberation of Palestine. We were organized. We engaged in resistance =o the 
occupation in all its forms... I turned to involvement in armed acti=ity. We carried out an operation (i.e., terrorist attack) 
in western Jerus=lem on Feb. 22, (sic., 21,) 1969." 
Official PA TV host: "When you carried out the operation and afterwards, =ow were you arrested?" 
Aisha Odeh: "Of course Israel arrests many people in such situations... T=ey gathered information and found evidence 
that led to the people who carr=ed out the operation... A year later I was tried, I and the members of the=cell - Rasmieh 
Odeh and Yaqub Odeh." 
Official PA TV host: "Are you all from the same family?" 
Aisha Odeh: "No, Rasmieh Odeh and Yaqub Odeh are from Lifta. I am from Di= Jarir. In addition there were Samia Al-
Tawil and Mahmoud Al-Ubeid. The fi=e of us were tried together, even though I had no connection to any of the= aside 
from Rasmieh. Yaqub Odeh was sentenced to 3 life sentences, Rasmieh=Odeh was sentenced to 3 life sentences, and I 
was sentenced to 2 life sent=nces... One life sentence for carrying out an operation, one life sentence=for not reporting 
the operation, and ten years for my membership in the (P=LP] organization..." 
Official PA TV host: "Israelis died [in the bombing]." 
Aisha Odeh: "We placed two bombs. One bomb exploded and one bomb was disc=vered a few moments before it 
exploded. Two were killed and 10 (sic., 20) =ere wounded."
