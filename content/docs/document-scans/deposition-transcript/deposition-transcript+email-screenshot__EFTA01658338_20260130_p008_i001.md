Fox News (7/28, Flood, 27.59M) recounts "a variety of MSNBC and CNN hosts made 
cameos" in the video, including "everyone from CNN's Don Lemon to NBC News' Chuck Todd 
dismissing violence amid images of burning buildings and attacks on law enforcement." The 
video, "which irked...Nadler," also "featured MSNBC host Ali Velshi famously declaring he was 
covering a `mostly a protest' despite a building burning right behind him," and adding, "It is 
not, generally speaking, unruly." 
The Washington Examiner (7/28, Dibble, 448K) reports Jordan also "condemned 
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee for what became a pattern of asking questions 
of...Barr only to interrupt and not allow him to answer." Jordan, who is "the top Republican on 
the panel, noted hours into the hearing that Democratic members had repeatedly cut off Barr 
while shouting that they were `reclaiming my time,' and "asked why Democrats even invited 
Barr to testify if they were not going to allow him to fully answer their queries." 
Barr Says Democrats Have Tried To "Discredit" Him. 
The Washington Post (7/28, Al, Zapotosky, Demirjian, Wagner, 14.2M) reports that in a written 
statement to the House Judiciary Committee, before which he testified on Tuesday, Attorney 
General Barr "alleged that Democrats have tried to discredit' him since he vowed to investigate 
the 2016 FBI probe of possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign and that 
the media has been unfair in covering the unrest." 
Reuters (7/28, Lynch, Wolfe) reports that Barr also "den[ied] accusations he is 
doing...Trump's bidding by intervening in high-profile cases." Reuters says that as Tuesday's 
hearing opened, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler told Barr, "Your tenure is marked by a 
persistent war against the Department's professional core in an apparent effort to secure favors 
for the President." Barr "denied taking actions to help Trump associates, saying they do not 
deserve special breaks but also should not be treated more harshly than other defendants." 
Reuters says Barr "also incited Democrats' fury by saying a report being drafted by federal 
prosecutor John Durham that is expected to highlight missteps by US intelligence agencies 
during their 2016 probe into collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia could be made 
public before the 2020 presidential election." 
CNBC (7/28, Breuninger, Macias, 3.62M) says on its website that Barr "offered a full-
throated defense of his much-criticized conduct in the federal probe of Russian election 
interference." CNBC also reports that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the committee's ranking member, 
"launched into his opening statement by decrying the Russia probe as a coordinated effort by 
Democrats to undermine Trump." Jordan said to Barr, "Spying. That one word, that's why 
they're after you." 
The New York Times (7/28, Fandos, Savage, Lafraniere, Qiu, 18.61M) reports that Barr 
also "accused Democrats of demonizing him because he believed the Trump-Russia 
investigation was misguided." The Times says Democrats "attacked Mr. Barr's intervention to 
recommend a shorter prison sentence for Mr. Trump's longtime friend Roger 3. Stone Jr. on 
seven felony crimes," but Barr "defended his extraordinary decision to overrule career 
prosecutors, saying that they were trying to treat Mr. Stone more harshly than other 
defendants." Barr said, "The prosecutors were trying to advocate for a sentence that was more 
than twice what anyone else in a similar position had ever served. ... This is a 67-year-old man, 
first-time offender, no violence, they were trying to put them in jail for seven to nine years. I 
was not going to advocate that. That is not the rule of law." 
The Washington Examiner (7/28, Mastrangelo, 448K) says Barr "struggled to offer a 
response during a round of questioning" from Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA), who "peppered the 
attorney general with questions about the Roger Stone sentencing, President Trump's Twitter 
feed, and Barr's role as head of the Justice Department and handling of the case." Johnson said, 
"You filed a sentencing recommendation hours after President Trump tweeted his dissatisfaction 
with the Stone recommendation." Barr said, "No, the night before," to which Johnson replied, "I 
know your story." The Examiner says Barr "shot back," "I'm telling my story, that's what I'm
