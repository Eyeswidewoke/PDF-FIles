Important Account Information 
Minimum Payment Addendum to the USAA Credit Card Agreement 
When we send you a bill. it will show your Minimum Payment Due. We must receive payment of at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date 
on the bill. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 23 of the USAA Credit Card Agreement, the amount of your Minimum Payment Due will be the 
greater of: (1) the sum (rounded to the nearest dollar) of 1% of your New Balance plus the interest and fees we charged as shown on the bill and any past due 
amounts: or (2) $15. However. it your New Balance exceeds your Credit Limit. then at our option. we may require you to pay any amount up to the entire 
ovetlimit amount instead of the Minimum Payment Due. In no event will your Minimum Payment Due exceed the amount of your New Balance. We may adjust 
your Minimum Payment Due in accordance with our PayAhead Program. 
Pay-Ahead Program: Your Regular Minimum Payment is the Minimum Payment amount calculated in accordance with the USAA Credit Card Agreement. If 
your aCCOunl is eligible for our Pay-Mead Program and is in good standing. when you make more than the Regular Minimum Payment. we may. at our option. 
permit you to skip some or all of your next two Regular Minimum Payments. When this occurs. we continue to calculate your Regular Minimum Payment: 
however. the amount of the minimum payment due displayed on the first page of your statement. on usaa.00m. on mobile devices. and on our phone systems 
is reduced by the amount you may skip. 
Your Regular Minimum Payment this month is $60.00. If the amount of the minimum payment due displayed on the first page of this statement is less than 
$60.00. you may skip the difference between the two amounts and you need only pay the lower amount under our Pay-Ahead Program. This means the 
amount that you must pay on this statement is $0.00. Remember that Finance Charges continue to accrue on all unpaid balances. 
If you use a bill paying service and pay the minimum, the payment made will be the amount of the minimum payment due displayed on the first 
page rather than the Regular Minimum Payment You may opt out of the Pay-Ahead Program at any time by calling us at 1.800.531.9762. 
Your 2019 Year-End Summary will be available on USAAcom and the USAA Mobile application by February 2020. Your account must be open and in good
