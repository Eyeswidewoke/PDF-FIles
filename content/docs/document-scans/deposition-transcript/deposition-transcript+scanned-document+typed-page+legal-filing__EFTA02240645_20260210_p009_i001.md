No matter how far you go back, the melting pot ideal was always murky. New 
immigrants typically found a foothold in tight communities of the foreign born, and 
assimilation was a rocky road, as witness the vicious fighting between Irish and 
Italian gangs for political power in Boston a century or more ago. 
The important thing throughout this turbulent history wasn't that the melting pot 
merged myth and reality but that ideals mattered. Most Americans had no idea that 
powerful mixed feelings existed in the old country, too. As a recent observer astutely 
put it, "America is the most hated country in the world and the country everyone 
wants to come to." When people grimly talk about the erosion of traditional norms, 
immigration policy could be Exhibit A. The world is witnessing a greater refugee crisis 
than at any previous period, we are told. A humane policy toward stateless people, 
whether they come from a war-devastated Syria or famine-devastated Senegal, 
should be upper most. Instead, some nativist faction is always seeking political power 
to deny entry. 
It would be hypocritical for me to decry the current uproar over illegal immigration 
when this country, for all its contentiousness, gave me a chance to fulfill my dreams. 
Statistics show that upward mobility in the U.S. is declining. A 2012 report from the 
independent Economic Policy Institute states, "While faith in the American Dream is 
deep, evidence suggests that the United States lacks policies to ensure the 
opportunities that the dream envisions. According to the data, there is considerably 
more mobility in most other developed economies." Comparing the earnings of 
fathers and sons, not just immigrants but across the whole society, the U.S. ranked 
fifth behind Slovenia, Chile, Italy, and the United Kingdom. 
As income inequality widens a cross the developed world, there a growing desire for 
the haves to shut out the have nots, a distressing trend. Terrorist fears are grossly 
exaggerating the pressure to keep foreigners out, while on the other side of the gate 
refugees have no alternative but to leave countries where normal daily life cannot be 
sustained. 
Strange as it may sound, I am grateful to the boiling pot and the melting pot both. 
Without the Vietnam War crisis, I would likely have been denied entry into this 
country, and without the Indian medical community to support me psychologically, my 
clashes with prejudice in the medical profession would have been harsher. The story 
of immigration has always been one of times in turmoil and populations in ferment. 
Those factors never change unless you are among the privileged few who enter this 
country based on a needed skill (as I did). 
Right now the nativist movement seems to be in the ascendant, and balancing merit-
based immigration (the model successfully used in Canada) and humanitarian 
concerns poses serious problems. The fact that the foreign-born amount to 13% of 
the population doesn't look like pluralism taken to the breaking point, but the figure 
swells when you count second-generation immigrants, and one sees more 
immigrants on the streets of big cities than in rural areas.
