Disposable world. 
The world is a waste system. A disposal of categories and names. 
The world is no longer important. The world is no longer a thing: description is. ItaTMs a world of words. Words are finite: 
they signify nothing other than themselves. AceThe word must be the thing it represents. Otherwise it is a symbol. It is a 
question of identity:al there isnaTMt any. Thereirms no thinking subject: only words. Only descriptions. 
No thinking subject. Metaphysical I, instead: not a part, but a limit. A unitless unity. The physical, the phenomenal world is 
gone. We arc no longer a part of it. We never were a part of it. The world is finite: the objective world was no more real than 
the words that were its habit..1 A finite world of words: the world as limits of language. aceThe limits of my language mean the 
limits of my world.a3 No part, but limit. aceNo longer any refuge in the infinities of grandeur,a4 of the universe, of 
physicalized reality. No pan, but limit. Never forget this finiteness, this limit of man. 
Finite man: metaphysical I: unitless unity: no pan, but limit. It means that there is no longer any possible distinction between 
observer and observed. It means that we live in a new whole, a new reality, one that is slippery, one that is expressed in 
language but cannot be expressed by language. It means that aceobserving is completing and we are content in a world that 
shrinks to an immediate whole that we do not need to understand, complete without secret arrangements of it in the mind.as
ficeThe same old fallacy persists1"the desire to introduce a unity in the world: the mythologists made it a woman or an 
elephant; the scientists made fun of the mythologists, but themselves turned the world into the likeness of a mechanical toy. 
One analogy is as good as anotherl 
The ficewords of the world are the life of the world.az It is the speech of truth in its true solitude: a nature that is created in 
what it says? 
The world is no longer important: true. The world is the only important thing to think about: true. The world: a closed door. 
AceA closed door slammed in the face of man. It is a barrier. And at the same time it is the way through:19
But through what? The physical world: an artifact, made or constructed of some basic, primary substance. The physical world 
is a created world: the production of something from nothing. The finite world, world of words: a new world, nonworld: 
everything must come from everything. Description is the thing: the world is created in what it says. Created: thus destroyed. 
The physical world is meaningless: acctransfer physical to language.a10
Finite man: acehe disposes the world in categories.aU A waste system: thereaTMs no getting rid of them without naming them, 
thataTMs the thing to keep in mind.12 Thus, any name, any definition or category empties the world as it creates it. It is a name
