I know it didn't =ust happen and I assume my responsibilities.. Does this means 
that I shoul= stay in this situation forever because of my previous mistakes ? l&=39;m starting to understand how life 
works.. it's not easy, actually i='s very scary and wild. I feel like I've been thrown in a jungle a=l of a sudden surrounded 
by lions. You've always told me that school i= unusfull and internships ( even if in good companies, like I've alway= found 
) as well since they are not paied so it was a waste of time. Now 1=#39;m working very hard as a babysitter from 8am to 
8pm, a paied job ( the=kind of job you've always told me to do) and assisting the photographe= when I can in order to 
learn something interesting ( babysitting is not v=ry interesting and it's taking most of my time and energy) but it'= 
paied... How long should I work as a babysitter in order to be successful=? Do you think this is getting me on the right 
path ?

Does wishing me well means n=t taking any news from me at all ? Here is a little 
brief of what happened=to me in the last month and this period that you've "wished me we=l" : I saw my grandmother 
dying in front of me ( one of the most pain=ul things I've ever experienced ), dealing with doctors, funerals, 40=A0had to 
move tones of stuff alone from my house without knowing whe=e to go and still now sleeping on a coach without a 
room on my own ( my mo=her rented my room for a year in Rome so I don't even have a real home=where to go ) 
Working 12h per day as a babysitter in order to earn some mo=ey because it's the only paying job I found without a 
degree after ask=ng everyone I knew. In addition trying to keep up with the photographer.. = promise I'm trying my best 
to be strong and stay positive but managin= all this alone at 20 years old with no moral support and a broken heart i=
