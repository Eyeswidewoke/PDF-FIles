As per your request I am forwarding the following summary: 
Re: The Burglary/Attempted Burglary allegations, the Palm Beach PD were surprised to hear this and indicated 
that there has never been such complaint(s) since Epstein was place on Community Control. I spoke further with 
Jack Goldberger and he indicated that Epstein employs private security through Wackenhut and they intercepted 
this person who was dressed in black like a Ninja and hiding in some bushes. They chased him to a dark 
Chrysler 300 and took down the tag info. From there they were able to find out that it was registered to a PI that 
has been associated/linked to Atty. Rothstein and the Gambino family. I spoke with DOC Community Control 
Supervisor, Ofc. Gaines, and he advised me that late last week Epstein informed him of a similar incident. Ofc. 
Gaines went on to say that he spoke with Epstein in late Sept. or possibly Oct. of last year and explained to him 
that he received "the best deal ever heard of for someone in his situation' and that he warned him to follow every 
condition by the letter so as not to get violated. If violated, he could very well be put on an ankle bracelet which 
would be even more of a restriction to him. 
Re: Similar defendants on community control and early termination, drawing from my experience (8'A yrs. of 
doing these cases), Daliah Weiss, Chief of SVU, and DOC there is no known case where a Sex Offender on 
Community Control has ever been given early termination of Community Control by agreement from our office or 
DOC. There have been rare instances where a person who has been on a very long probation has been given 
early termination of probation after serving a considerable number of years on probation. 
Re: The position 
. Attomey's office on early termination of the State's case against Epstein. I again 
spoke with AUS 
nd inquired specifically of any knowledge that she had in reference to 
representations ma e y er or anyone associated with her office regarding Epstein's efforts to early term his 
Community Control on the State charges. She indicated that she had not made any such representations 
however her boss, interim U.S. Atty. Sloman may have. After checking she sent me a portion of the last letter 
sent to Epstein's attorneys. I have forwarded that to you by attachment. 
Please let me know if there is anything else that I can provide to you.

Hi Barbara — Here is the relevant portion of the last letter to JE's attorneys regarding the termination of 
supervision: 
In light of Mr. Acosta's prior statements to Mr. Epstein's counsel that Mr. Epstein would be 
eligible for any benefit available to other similarly-situated state defendants, the Office agrees that Mr. 
Epstein may apply for early termination or modification of community control in accordance with Fl. 
Stat. § 948.05 and 948.10(4), assuming that Mr. Epstein has completed "the sanctions imposed in the 
community control plan." The Office takes no position regarding such an application; it is entirely 
within the discretion of the State Attorney's Office and the Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge as to 
whether it is in "the best interests of justice and the welfare of society" to allow Mr. Epstein to 
terminate prematurely his community control. Mr. Epstein and his counsel may not make a
