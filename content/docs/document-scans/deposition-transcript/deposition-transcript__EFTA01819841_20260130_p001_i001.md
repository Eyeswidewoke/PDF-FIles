the point is . I try and actually do what i can... when it comes to you , you refuse over and over. 
only thinking about yourself . I am not attacking you. at all. i am trying to get you to look in the 
mirror and see what i and everyone else sees. I have done hundreds of things that i totally 
disagree with , to placate you. In fact alomost every day or at least every weekend. what you 
now describe as thoughtful and selflless, started years ago when you decided that you didn't want 
around„ No one is at the house unless you agree, I cat the shitiest of food, and lead a life of 
a bus driver , with the same exact motivation that i had when i sent the email, I DO

Ok, you are upset. 
Please remember you offered to do this last night so don't tell me I forced you into doing 
something you detest. I don't think I was forceful! at all...you offered a call, I said why not an 
email. I couldn't believe you really did something that thoughtful and selfless so I asked to see 
it. I said thank you many times because I know you did it for me and I know you didn't really 
understand what it meant or agreed with the idea behind it but you still did it. Don't attack me 
because of it now, take the credit. Frankly, it was a much better lesson than trying to argue 
with me or nag about my flaws. I got the message.

I had previously asked whether you wanted to be in the house wiht 
so you could see for 
ourself , you have decided that the help i asked for was petty. Can i get you anything , 
head massage. 
tea, was not important. though I said these are the small things i d 
appreciate. then when others gladly do as i ask. ," 
feel insecure. you feel no compunction 
to spoling my birthday, because you don't like 
spoling my highly anticipated trip to new 
york, because you overhear me talking on the phone and i according to you, said baby in kind 
tones. so you threw a tantrum. no sex fun, no hug, you wanlked out without saying goodbye. 
and today not only ask me to do as you put it petty , things (petty is trite , trivial, what you 
asked was for me to transmit your words as they were coming out of my mouth, having me do 
something i strongly detest, which i did immediately without argumnet, and even then, you 
couldn't stop, and had to ask for proof, and then more ( and you wonder where the idea that 
you are a spoiled brat comes from„ ) . I had asked if you wanted a conference call. the fact 
that you take offense to the way people perceive you, you attribute to me. the fact and ive told 
you this mupltiple time, the more I say to defend you and your behavior, the more i say , no,
