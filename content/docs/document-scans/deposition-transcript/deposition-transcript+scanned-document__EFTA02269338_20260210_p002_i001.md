• Do you think 
has a phone, do you think Edwin has an x box. Why do you 
think 
asked for board games. 
> You fail to realize that ■ 
is in one of the most challenged positions in 
America today, He is a rich, white man, from a rich town with rich parents. 
Society chooses to believe that he and we have done nothing to achieve our 
success. 
It will be hard to get into school. People will be offered jobs who 
are lesser than him for diversity. It is what it is but it is fact. 
> So my entire point to1.s he needs to choose when he does things. If he 
chooses not to read all weekend then he needs to get it done. if he chooses to 
go to a friend's house that is his choice. If he chooses to play video games 
until 12:30 am on Saturday and then first thing he did when he got up is go turn 
on the video games, not go see Gemma, not get food. Video games 
> Bad choices are very very expensive over time and at a certain point it is too 
late to fix. He is quickly getting to the place in life that he will not be able 
to fix getting bad grades. Schools will look at his grades from 9th grade on. 
> I do not care if Ills thinks I am tough and all his friends parents are far 
more lacks. 
> 1 yes he is correct it is easier for his friends. Most of them are soft, their 
parents are soft and they live and a soft world. 
> 2 II friends are probably academically far far smarter than III They can do 
twice as much in half the time with less effort. Rich Levine, Chris Hannan, Brad 
Quilici, Travis Bradford and on and on. His friends are the same 
> Resilience is what will breed success. Not softness.

• I had this conversation with Ty last night. and if he chooses to spend his 
time unwisely it will cost him now because I refuse to back down. The real cost 
will be so apparent in 5 years when he is accepted at no schools, get a shitty 
job, has a shitty car, lives in a shitty rodent and insect infested apartment, 
and ,if he is lucky, has any women that finds any of that attractive. But, trust 
me, it will not be women like you, or Paula or any of the girls he chooses to 
waste his day away snap chatting with. They will be long gone with men who can 
support them, their kids and the endless gym memberships, lunches all week in 
towns like New Canaan and Birmingham, Range rovers and diamonds. And vacations in 
South Beach, the Caribbean and Europe. 
> You tell me what door do you want for your son 
> Door #1 work hard, really hard now, Think his dad is a dick but I can live 
with that. and by the way, I actually think understands I am the way I am and 
for the most part every prediction I make is co 
> Door *2 shitty everything and fear of not knowing where the next dollar is 
going to come from 
> And the reality is, it does not only cost II. It cost you and me. because 
long term if we do not keep pressing now, we have an unequipped human with no 
concept of reality is utterly unresilient and a quitter. Do you think your 
sister, if she could go back in time 18 years, would change anything? 
> I would not change anything I have done so far. I have the perfect case study. 
I look at him every time I look in the mirror. And by the way, Illis a 
significantly better athlete then I ever was, and much smarter. He will also be 
taller and heavier. I too top it off, he has parents and an nanny who have
