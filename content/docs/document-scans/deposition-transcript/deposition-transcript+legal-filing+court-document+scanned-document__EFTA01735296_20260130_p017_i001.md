is no easy analogy to be drawn with the English criminal procedure. I issued the EAW because 
I was satisfied that there was substantial and probable cause to accuse Julian Assange of the 
offences. 
9. It is submitted on Julian Assange's behalf that it would be possible for me to interview him by 
way of Mutual Legal Assistance. This is not an appropriate course in Assange's case. The 
preliminary investigation is at an advanced stage and I consider that it is necessary to 
interrogate Assange, in person, regarding the evidence in respect of the serious allegations 
made against him. 
10. Once the interrogation is complete it may be that further questions need to be put to witnesses 
or the forensic scientists. Subject to any matters said by him, which undermine my present 
view that he should be indicted, an indictment will be launched with the court thereafter. It can 
therefore be seen that Assange is sought for the purpose of conducting criminal proceedings 
and that he is not sought merely to assist with our enquiries. 
11. It is not correct to assert that Assange has made repeated offers to be interviewed. In 
September and October 2010 I was in constant contact with counsel Bjorn Hurtig. It was not 
possible to arrange an interview because Assange did not come back to Sweden, despite my 
request that he did. Frequently, Hurtig was not able to contact Assange to arrange the details 
for him to attend for interview. An offer of an interview by telephone was made by Hurtig. I 
declined this offer for the reasons outlined above. It was because his failure to attend Sweden 
for interview and so that criminal proceedings could continue, that it was necessary for me to 
request from the court an order for his arrest. 
The person who knows whether she wants the defendant for the purpose of being prosecuted is the Swedish 
prosecutor Ms Ny. The defence says it is unfair that she has not been called to give live evidence, so that her 
account can be properly explored and if appropriate challenged. They point to other cases where this has 
happened, and where the domestic court has not ordered extradition. I have already determined that Ms Ny's 
statement is admissible. It is hearsay. It has not been exposed to cross-examination. On the other hand we 
know the source of the information. The defence have had the opportunity to attack the credibility of the 
witness, and have taken that opportunity. In fact the attack on credibility amounts to very little. The math 
criticism comes from the Swedish judge, Brita Sundberg-Weitman. She does not know Ms Ny. She bases her 
opinion on what she has been told by this defendant's lawyers and articles she had read in the press. In fact she 
produced comparatively little evidence to support her strong criticism of Ms Ny. I refer briefly to that part of 
her evidence at page 3 above. Moreover she confirmed that she had no direct personal knowledge of what had 
happened in the investigation. Her evidence is based upon facts supplied to her by the defence lawyers. Mr 
Hurtig denied telling her that Ms Ny had made no effort to interview his client. He has never met her. There is 
therefore no clear evidence as to the source of the information on which Brita Sundberg-Weisman formed her 
opinion. One probable explanation is that Mr Assange's London lawyers provided her with material they had in 
rum received from Mr Hurtig. However there arc other explanations and the evidence is simply unclear on this 
point. Mr Alhem expressly made no judgement on Ms Ny. Mr Hurtig clearly does know the prosecutor 
personally. He has not directly accused her of lying, or of malicious intent, but has strongly criticised her 
judgement. However, insofar as there were significant differences between his evidence and her evidence on 
facts known to them both, he conceded in cross-examination that her evidence is substantially correct.
