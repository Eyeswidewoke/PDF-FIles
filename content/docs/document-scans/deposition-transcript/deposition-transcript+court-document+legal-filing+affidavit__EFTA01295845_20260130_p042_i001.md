removing, concealing or otherwise harming or reducing the value of the property of one or 
both of the parties." On March 26, 2012, the Court held a final pretrial conference to set 
deadlines for trial. The Court also maintained the parties' visitation agreement.. 
8 See. Paragraph (2) (b) of this Court's Order in t•8j this matter dated December 22. 2011.
9 Pk. Francis informed the Court. in his Motion to Restrain Respondent From Denying Petitioner Access to Former Marital 
Residence that the parties negotiated a visitation agreement in September of 2011. whereby both parties have custody of their 
minor daughter, Brooklyn. for fifteen (15) days of each month. Such agreement was not contested by Dr. Wright Francis. 
On July 16, 2012, Dr. Wright-Francis filed an Emergency Motion for Issuance of Show 
Cause Order, alleging that Mr. Francis violated the Court's December 22, 2011 Order by 
withdrawing Two Hundred Twenty Thousand, One Hundred Seventy Nine Dollars and 
Ninety Three Cents ($220.179.93) from his Fidelity Rollover IRA account. While the Court 
initially granted Dr. Wright-Francis' motion on July 17, 2012, that Order was later vacated 
on July 25, 2012. The Court reasoned that it was not able to make a determination since 
discovery had not been completed. ("201 Instead, the Court instructed the parties to 
retain a Certified Personal Accountant (CPA) to appraise all of their jointly owned 
properties and to recommend how the marital assets should be divided. The parties never 
complied with the order to retain 9] an accountant...

On July 25, 2012, the Court issued a Divorce Decree to the parties and reserved 
determination on issues of custody, alimony, personal and real property for a later date. 
Meanwhile, the parties continued to live in separate sections of the marital homestead. 
During a June 17, 2013 hearing, the parties informed the Court that they were able to 
resolve the issues of custody and visitation amicably, consistent with their earlier 
agreement. On July 12, 2013 the parties were referred back to mediation. After the second 
mediation session, the mediator reported that the parties had reached a total impasse. 
However, in a status conference held on September 10, 2013, the parties advised the 
Court that they had reached an agreement and through counsel, the terms were read onto 
the record. Each party confirmed that the terms were accurate and they agreed to them. 
The Court acknowledged the terms and ordered counsel for both parties to reduce the 
agreement to writing and submit it with their client's respective signatures. Instead each 
party submitted separate draft settlements that differed slightly from the oral agreement 
articulated in Court. As a ["10] result, the Court entered an Order on November 4, 2013 
that incorporated the negotiated terms which the parties stipulated to on the record in the 
September 10, 2013 hearing. On November 18, 2013, this Court entered an Order which 
granted a Motion to Amend filed by Dr. Wright-Francis. The Order amended the previous 
November 4, 2013 Order which instructed Mr. Francis to pay his settlement amount by 
certified check or bank draft instead of transferring the sum from his retirement account 
directly to Dr. Wright-Francis' account or to her personally by electronic means. Mr. 
Francis objected to Dr. Wright-Francis' method of payment request, filed a timely
