request and invoke my rights as an employee to the entitlement of the provision of the Family 
and Medical Leave to care for my father. Under this entitlement, I am granted up to three 
months of advance leave (sick/annual), which are allowed under the program and will end on 
July 27, 2010. 
I know that I would be a tremendous asset for the Port of Anacortes as demonstrated by my 
performance and abilities in St. Thomas. I come to work daily giving 110% of myself to make 
sure that the job of protecting our country from terrorist for CBP is carried out with great 
vigilance and diligence, which I take very seriously. Being allowed to transfer to the Port of 
Anacortes would not only benefit me with having to care for my parents, but the port would 
gain a very dedicated employee. I believe I have followed and will continue to follow all 
protocols to a "T". I am failing to understand why as a white female who has been with the 
federal government more than 15 years, dependable, always willing to go out of my way to 
help in any way, I have also been recognized for my ability to my job in an excellent manner, I 
have many accolades from travelers who sent in letters thanking me for the service that I have 
provided above and beyond the call of duty but I can't believe that someone would not grant 
me this hardship transfer. I do not wish to resign from CBP and lose all of the time that the 
government has invested in me and me in it (the government). I do not want to see my parents 
suffer or be placed in a nursing home. That, I do not want to happen and I do not think that 
anyone in my situation would want either. 
For the past eight months I have tried everything from requesting a hardship transfer, to 
temporary duty assignments (TDY) to locations in the state of Washington. The Seattle OFO 
said they could work with me as long as my present duty station (the Area Port of St. Thomas) 
would okay it, by releasing me to the Seattle OFO. Again, that did not happen. I have tried the 
leave share program; that did not work either. In December 2009, I requested from Mission 
Support Specialist Glenda L. Sanchez for help in being placed on the federal leave share 
program. After more than three months, I was told I was approved, but the message that was 
distributed throughout our nationwide system from CBPO Merta Bess, was sent out with my 
name misspelled. It had no information as why I needed the donated leave or a phone number 
where someone who wanted to donate leave to me could call and ask questions or possibly 
donate. I have saved all e-mails and communications as proof of all the allegations and claims 
that I am making. So with this information known, I went and requested 240 hours of advance 
sick leave (which I was granted), while still working on the hardship transfer leave without pay 
under the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993. I will need to pay this leave back or work off 
during the course of my federal career. Please help me be able to continue my dream to keep 
working for CBP and also allow me to help my parents in their dire time of need. 
In September of 2009, when I submitted my first request for a hardship transfer, I advised 
management about my family members that are in the vicinity of my parents residence. I have 
a brother who lives in Arlington, Washington about 15 miles from my parents who would help, 
but currently he is being treated for rectal cancer. This has been going on for the past three 
years. He too has had to miss a lot of work while undergoing his own treatments for cancer to 
include undergoing four surgeries, he has had MRSA, reconstruction of his colostomy and two 
hernia repairs. He is the father of five children ages seven to 16, and is expecting more 
surgeries to in the near future. My sister Linda lives about one hour from my parents. She is 
mother that works fulltime and care for her disabled granddaughter. 
In May, my father was diagnosed by Dr. Jacqueline Wong, MD, Vitreoretinal Surgeon that he 
has bleeding behind his right eye and would lose his eyesight. Dr. Wong needs to do Surgery
