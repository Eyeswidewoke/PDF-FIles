I have got everyone I have =sked to agree to see her - on the basis of coming to seek their advice =bout her 
project and whom else they think she should meet. 
Just FYI - (this is clearly =aid out inthe powerpoint) 
Mum raised $ 57,000 for Phase = - The feasibility Phase of creating a Pilot database and Locator first =n the 
UK - This phase of the project is now completed. 
Phase 2 - Amt. to be raised =75,000 to create the Meta data and database 
Phase 3 - Amt to be =aised $150,000 to have the custom search capability customized =or her project (the 
leading Cheshire digital unit of the University of =iverpool has agreed to do this.)

3D= 
EVERY SURVIVOR'S =ESTIMONY DESERVES TO BE FOUND: 
THAT IS RFTF Online's =ission to enable that to really be so —for future =enerations 
=nbsp; 
=nbsp; 
The RFTF Online Database =amp; Locator — will allow federated searching (this means 
the =bility to search across and down into multiple holocaust survivor =rchives at the same time -even when they are 
kept separately in =ifferent locations.) For the first time all collaborating =olocaust survivor testimony archives will be 
accessible from the one =FTF online Search interface. This will mean that location and =esearch of survivor testimonies 
that have never been able to be =ound before in searches with the major search engines,will now be =ossible.. 
=nbsp; 
Major Survivor Testimony =ollections are happy to share their collection Meta-data with RFTF 
=nline because we are not duplicating their collections ourselves —=we are uniquely helping scholars, students and 
members of the =ublic to find the right collection or collections of Survivor =estimonies amongst the thousands of 
individual collections online by =he use of special search technology and innovation in Meta data tagging =E240. that 
does not rely on ranking Internet locations by their =opularity or by their being most cited in the holocaust literature. 
=nbsp; 
Google, Yahoo and Bing —=the three most used search engines in the West today, can bring a 
=earcher to the 'door' of archives that contain survivor =estimonies — but none of them can 'take you inside' the 
=ontents of those in-house collections —neither one by one - Nor =n combination. 
=nbsp; 
Searchers must laboriously =isit EACH library archive and search each database or collection =f databases 
belonging to an individual institution. The searches are =ery time-consuming and more often than not, fruitless if one is 
not =sing a 'correct' spelling of a camp or place name =tc. The one search at RFTF Online Locator will suffice to bring =p 
the 'needle in the haystack' that has eluded all =earch efforts to date. 
Thanks Ghislaine for =nswering me just as soon as poss - whether you will be able to put a =all into Mort 
Zuckerman's office tomorrow to see if he can make time to =ee Mum - so she can present him her project and seek his 
advice =tc.. 
thanks alot in advance. 
Christine.
