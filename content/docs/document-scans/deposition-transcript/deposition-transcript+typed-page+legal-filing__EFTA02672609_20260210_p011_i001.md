To g=t a bit more specific: Each year, the House and Senate are supposed to agree on 12 appropriations bills to 
fund the federal agenci=s and set spending priorities. Congress has become really bad at passing thes= bills, so in recent 
years they've resorted to stopgap budgets to keep t=e government funded (known as "continuing resolutions"). =The 
last stopgap passed on March 28, 2013, and ends on Sept. 30. 
In theory, Congress could have passed another stopgap before Tuesday. But the Democratic-controlled Senate 
and Republican-controlled souse are at odds over what that stopgap should look like. The House passed a =unding bill 
over the weekend that delayed Obamacare for one year and repealed a ta= on medical devices. The Senate rejected that 
measure. They voted a few more=times and still no agreement. So... we're getting a shutdown. 
Does a shutdown mean everyone who works for the federal government has to go home? 
Not exactly. =A0The laws and regulations governing shutdowns separate federal workers into "essential" and 
"non-essential." (Actually, the preferred term nowadays is "excepted" and "non-excepted." This wa= tweaked in 1995 
because "non-essential" seemed a bit hurtful. But we x=;11 keep things simple.) 
The Office of Management and Budget recentl= ordered managers at all federal agencies to conduct reviews to 
see which of their employees fall into each of these two categories. If a shutdown hits, th= essential workers stick 
around, albeit without pay. The non-essential wo=kers have to go home after a half-day of preparing to close shop. 
Which parts of government stay open? 
There are a whole bun=h of key government functions that carry on during a shutdown, including anything 
related to national security= public safety, or programs written into permanent law (like Social Security=. Here's a 
partial list: 
-- Any em=loyee or office that "provides for the national security, including the cond=ct of foreign relations 
essential to the national security or the safety of life =nd property." That means the U.S. military will keep operating, 
fo= one. So will embassies abroad. 
-- Any employee who conducts "essential activities to the extent that they protect life=and property." So, for 
example: Air traffic control stayed open= So did all emergency medical care, border patrol, federal prisons, most law 
enforcemen=, emergency and disaster assistance, overseeing the banking system, operating=the power grid, and 
guarding federal property. 
<=b> Agencies have to keep sending out benefits and operating programs that are written into permanent law 
or get multi-year funding. That means sending out Social Secu=ity checks and providing certain types of veterans' 
benefits. Unemployme=t benefits and food stamps will also continue for the time being, since their funding =as been 
approved in earlier bills. 
-- All age=cies with independent sources of funding remain open, including the U.S. Postal Servi=e and the 
Federal Reserve. 
-- Members of Congress can stick around, since their pay is written into permanent law. =A0Congressional 
staffers however, will also get divided into essential and non-essential, with the latter getting furloughed. Therefore 
many White Hou=e employees probably got sent home. 
The 1.3 million or so "esse=tial" civilian employees who stay on could well see their paychecks delayed during 
the shutdown, depending on the timing. They should, however, receive retroac=ive pay if and when Congress decides to 
fund the government again.
