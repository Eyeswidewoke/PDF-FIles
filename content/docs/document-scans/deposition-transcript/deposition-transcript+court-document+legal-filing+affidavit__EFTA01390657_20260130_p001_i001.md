(iv) 
"Exposure. The definition of "Exposure" in Paragraph 12 is hereby amended by replacing 
"Valuation Date" in the first line thereof with "Valuation Time". 
(v) 
Limit on Secured Party's Liability. The Secured Party will not be liable for any losses or 
damages that the Pledgor may suffer as a result of any failure by the Secured Party to 
perform, or any delay by it in performing, any of its obligations under this Annex if the 
failure or delay results from circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Secured 
Party or its Custodian, such as interruption or loss of computer or communication services, 
labor disturbance, natural disaster or local or national emergency. 
(vi) 
Further Assurances. If the Pledgor fails (a) to execute and deliver to the Secured Party such 
financing statements, assignments, or other documents or (b) to do such other things relating 
to the Posted Collateral as the Secured Party may reasonably request in order to protect and 
maintain its security interest in the Posted Collateral and to protect, preserve, and realize 
upon the Posted Collateral, then the Secured Party is hereby authorized by the Pledgor (but 
not required) to complete and execute such financing statements, assignments, and other 
documents as the Secured Party deems appropriate for such purposes. The Pledgor hereby 
appoints the Secured Party, during the term of this Agreement, as the Pledgor's agent and 
attorney-in-fact to complete and execute such financing statements, assignments and other 
documents and to perform all other acts which the Secured Party may deem appropriate to 
protect and maintain its security interest in the Posted Collateral and to protect, preserve, and 
realize upon the Posted Collateral. The power-of-attorney granted herein to the Secured 
Party is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable during the term of this Agreement. 
(vii) 
Transfer. 
Eligible Collateral contained in Eligible Accounts shall be deemed (i) "Transferred" to Party 
A for purposes of this Annex at all times while such Eligible Accounts are designated as 
Cash Collateral Accounts in accordance with this Agreement, (ii) "Transferred" to Party B 
for purposes of this Annex when the security interest in such Eligible Collateral in favor of 
Party A is released, and (iii) held by Party A for purposes of this Annex at all times on and 
after the Transfer of such Eligible Collateral to Party A and before the Transfer of such 
Eligible Collateral to Party B. 
(viii) 
The terms of Paragraph 13 of the Annex shall be amended by inserting the following as a 
new paragraph (m) as follows: 
"(m) Withholding Tax on Interest Amount with respect to Posted Collateral comprised 
of Cash: 
The provisions of Section 2(d) of this Agreement shall not apply with respect to payment of 
the Interest Amount under this Anne; and any withholding tax on the Interest Amount shall 
not constitute an Indemnifiable Tax under this Agreement. Paragraph 6(d)(ii) of this Annex 
is hereby amended by inserting "less any applicable withholding tax" after "the Interest 
Amount" in line 4 thereof. 
The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, when interpreting any provision or 
representation in this Agreement (other than this Annex) relating to tax matters, references to 
"payment under this Agreement" or any other words with a similar purport made in this 
Agreement (excluding this Annex) shall be deemed to exclude payment of the Interest 
Amount under this Annex."
