5. Why have a=lifestream? Because your computer-based information and co=munication is scattered over lots 
of devices (phones, pods, pads, laptops) and applicatio=s (mail, video viewers, Wordpress for blogging). Sometimes yo=

7. Your lifes=ream has one other important aspect. Whenever you add some=hing new, you can check the

your stream the same as your blog: your blog equals the =93public" documents on your stream. It also means you can 
merge any number of streams (i.e. the public parts of those streams) as you would merge decks of cards, preserving 
chronological order. Stream-merge is a simple but powerful operation, because....
