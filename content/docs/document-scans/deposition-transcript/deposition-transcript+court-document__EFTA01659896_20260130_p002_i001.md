investigation also began to look into financial aspects of the case, requiring the issuance of several 
subpoenas. At that time, Mr. Lefcourt be an levelin accusations of improprieties with the 
investigation and sought a meeting with 
• who was then Chief of the Criminal 
Section. By that time, our Office had already received a proposed initial indictment package, which 
had been reviewed by the supervisors in our West Palm Beach Office and by attorneys with the 
Justice De artment's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, but which was awaiting review by 
and 
. The Office deferred presenting the indictment to the grand jury 
to accommodate your client's request for a meeting. The Office also agreed to wait several weeks 
for that meeting to occur to allow four of Mr. Epstein's attorneys to be present, and also provided 
Mr. Epstein's counsel with a list of the statutes that were the subject of the federal investigation. 
On June 26, 2007, 
and 
and two 
Special Agents with the FBI met with four attorneys for Mr. Epstein, specifically, Alan Dershowitz, 
Roy Black, Gerald Lefcourt, and Lilly Ann Sanchez. During that meeting, Professor Dershowitz 
and other members of the defense team presented legal and factual arguments against a federal 
indictment. Counsel for the defense also requested the opportunity to present written arguments, 
which was granted. The arguments and written materials provided by the defense were examined 
by the Office and rejected. 
On July 31, 2007, 
and 
and two FBI 
agents again met with Roy Black, Gerald Lefcourt, and Lilly Ann Sanchez. On that date, the Office 
presented a written sheet of terms that would satisfy the Office's federal interest in the case and 
discussed the substance of those terms. That term sheet is attached hereto. As you will note, one 
of those terms was: 
Epstein agrees that, if any of the victims identified in the federal investigation file 
suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida over his person and the subject 
matter. Epstein will not contest that the identified victims are persons who, while 
minors, were victims of violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections(s) 2422 
and/or 2423. 
During that meeting, the focus was on Mr. Epstein's unwillingness to spend time in prison, and 
various suggestions were raised by defense counsel, including the proposal that Mr. Epstein could 
serve a sentence of home confinement or probation. This was repeatedly mentioned by counsel for 
Mr. Epstein as being equivalent to a term of incarceration in a state or federal prison. Mr. Epstein's 
counsel mentioned their concerns about his safety in prison, and our Office offered to explore a plea 
to a federal charge to allow Mr. Epstein to serve his time in a federal facility. Counsel were also 
presented with a conservative estimate of the sentence that Mr. Epstein would face if he were 
convicted: an advisory guideline range of 188 - 235 months of imprisonment with a five-year 
mandatory minimum prison term, to be followed by lifetime supervised release. Counsel was told 
that Mr. Epstein had two weeks to accept or reject the proposal.
