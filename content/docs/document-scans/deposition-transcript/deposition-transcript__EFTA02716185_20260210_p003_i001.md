Oil vols were a surprise today, rallying along with flatp=ice. With the weekend decay and price rally, one would expect 
prompt vols to come off 2 vols..interestingly they ended up 1.5 vols.. We heard about some producer activity in cal16, 
taking advantage of the contango and relat=vely cheaper skew. Also, WTI/Bre vol spread rallied in the back (0.75 in 
dec5).. Jun5 and Dec5 wti/bre vol spread is now getting into a sell region in my opinion...

Investor risk appetite has returned following the stabili=ation in the Ruble and oil prices, causing equities and the base 
complex to rise but Nickel and Aluminium have been left behind by the move. Chinese housing data has improved with 
completions rising 8.1% yoy but the floor space under construction was only up 10.1%, the smallest increase in 9 years. 
Copper moved upwards as the bears take profit. It hit highs of - $6430 at around noon and dropped off slightly in the 
afternoon.&n=sp; The IMF has urged Zambia, Africa's 2nd biggest copper producer to resolve the issues with moving 
from a value added tax regime to a royalty model which has been cited as the cause for the closure of the 117 kMT/yr 
Lumwana copper mine, with First Quantum and Vedanta expected to follow suit. Chile's Codelco have approved a 
$3.3bn investment to transform the Chuquica=ata mine into an underground operation to extend it's life by 40 years 
and have it producing 320kMT/year Global copper production is approaching the 2 mMT record high at 1.993 mMT. 
Aluminium traded up in the morning but dropped sharply at around 15:00 to test support at around $1900. Nickel did 
not see much in terms of a sustained rally in the morning and came off sharply at around 13:00. Chinese ferro-nickel 
imports are set to surge in the next 2 years on the removal of a tax on overseas purcha=es and a number of Indonesian 
projects coming online as Chinese firms have skirted the Indonesian ore export ban by investing in in plants in Indonesia 
in order to export Nickel Pig Iron. China has been seen importing 200.250kMT in 2015. Zinc prices rose in the morning 
and were stable throughout the afternoon. Zinc production has hit a new high of 1.17 mMT. Lead has rallied on the 
news that smelters in Henan are cutting output by up to 30%, causing the global lead surplus to fall to 7451 kMT 
Shanghai Aluminium on warrant stocks are down 6.55% to 69.8 kMT. LME Aluminium on warrant stocks are down 
2.47%% to 1957.7 kMT. Shanghai Copper on warrant stocks are down 6.41% to 26.6 kMT. LME Copper stocks are flat 
140.7 kMT. LME Nickel stocks are up 0.03% to 304.6 kMT.
