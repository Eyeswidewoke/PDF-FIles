While the internati=nal community should not abandon efforts to limit carbon emissions, scient=sts must also 
be prepared to take geoengineering seriously. Humanity may already have passed so many global warming 
tipping=points that - even with radical action to cut emissions - it may be import=nt to have some form of 
geoengineering in our toolkit. 
The worst we can do=is fall into the trap of thinking geoengineering is a panacea to our clima=e change 
problem. While its initial costs may be seductively low, no one knows the unintended consequences of trying=to alter 
the planet's atmosphere. Just as it seems to cost almost nothing =o emit carbon - leading all of us to emit more than we 
ought to - geoengin=ering may appear cheap at first, only to leave humanity and nature to foot a much larger bill later 
on. &qu=t;Free riding" turns out not to be cheap after all. "Free drivin=" may face the same conclusion. 
Nor is it likely th=t everyone will face the same costs. Climate change does not affect all ar=as of the globe 
evenly. Neither will geoengineering. What if it leads to a further drying out of the southwestern United States=or of sub-
Saharan Africa, or to flooding elsewhere? 
While the risks can=ot be ignored, not even considering geoengineering research is clearly not=an option. 
Desertification and flooding are also among the many consequences of unchecked global warming. The benefit-=ost 
calculation of geoengineering must take these effects into account. The fact that climate change's effects are 
di=tributed unevenly around the globe may also lead some nations to experimen= with geoengineering on their own. 
India's national security advisor would='t be doing his job if he didn't at least consider countering the monsoon effects of 
carbon with relatively small am=unts of extra sulfur. And Bangladesh's finance minister would be remiss if=he didn't 
weigh the all-too-real costs of moving tens of millions of peopl= against the benefits of cloud-brightening (another 
possible way to deflect more sunlight back into space). </=pan> 
In short, it will n=t just be up to U.S. scientists or a handful of technologically advanced c=untries to weigh the 
pros and cons of geoengineering. These technologies will be available to many countries - and as we see tod=y, world 
leaders don't always succeed in working together to combat the th=eat of climate change. 
All it takes is a s=ngle actor willing to focus on the purported benefits to his country or he= region to pull the 
geoengineering trigger. The task with geoengineering is to coordinate international inaction while=the international 
community considers what steps should be taken. The fate=of the planet cannot be left in the hands of one leader, one 
nation, one b=llionaire. Fortunately, we are still many years off from the full "free driver" effect taking h=ld. There's 
some time to engage in a serious global governance debate and =areful research: building coalitions, guiding countries 
and perhaps even i=dividuals lest they take global matters into their own hands. In fact, that is where the discussion 
stands at the momen=, with a governance initiative convened by the British Royal Society, the Academy of Sciences for 
the Dev=loping World, and the Environmental Defense Fund, among other deliberation= guiding how geoengineering 
research should be pursued. <http://www.srmgi.org/> 
With time come the =quot;free drivers" 
The clock, however,=is ticking. A single dramatic climate-related event anywhere in the world = think Hurricane 
Katrina on steroids - could trigger the "free driver" effect. That event need not be global =nd it need not even be 
conclusively linked to global warming. A nervous le=der of a frightened nation might well race past the point of debate 
to dep=oyment. The "free driver" effect will all but guarantee that we will face this choice at some point. "Free ridi=g" 
and "free driving" occupy opposite poles of the spectrum=of climate action: One ensures that individuals won't supply 
enough of a p=blic good. The other creates an incentive to engage in potentially reckless geoengineering and supply a 
global bad. It's tough=to say which one is more dangerous. Together, these powerful forces could =ush the globe to the 
brink. =font color=110000ff">Gernot Wagner <http://www.gwagner.com/> , the author of But Will the Planet Notice=
