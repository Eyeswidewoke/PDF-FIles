#I. I would love to go to Robin flood and can sit at any table. Hopefully I might know some of the people at that 
table....but if this is a hassle, I can call Liz Smith and easily buy a ticket for the Literacy Partners at Lincoln 
Center... 
#2. IFP (Independent Filmmakers Project) Spring Gala at Diane von Furstenberg's honoring her daughter Tatiana....was a 
hugh success. Had cocktails and film clip presentation on second floor of her studio and then a dinner for 180 
downstairs in her hugh white photo gallery with long tables covered with hot chartreuse cloths and piles of bright 
Italian food down the center. It was fabulous. Very large photos of movie and rock stars lined the walls. Oliver Stone, 
DvF. Uma. Patty Clarkson. Blythe Danner and son Jake. Joel Schumacher. Mamie Glimmer (Meryl Strccp's 
daughter)...and tons of young terrific hip filmmakers (and models, artists, photographers, fashion designers) that we 
cultivate came. All the kids had a ball and then walked a block to the Boom Boom Room till 2:00am. Got tons of 
press. Jaqui Safra gave us S10,000 worth of wine from his own Napa Valley vineyard...kids drinking S100 bottles of 
wine...and Michael Saylor giving 525.000 for food and the opportunity to get his name on invite and meet a hip group. 
Saylor is a complete creep. He has no personality. Sort of like a zombie on a drug. We had smart directors sitting next 
to him and his idiot gorgeous date and could not get any conversation out of him except "I have a yacht I am taking to 
Cannes". 
I walked him around and he was so weird that even I ran away from him. There is an obvious personal disconnect and I 
don't think I can just take his money and deliver a better life because he has no feel for social behavior. Diane was 
over the moon we did this great event for her daughter because her son was honored the next night at the Whitney 
Museum party a block south of her store/building under a tent on the land where they will build a new downtown 
museum. That party was also a bit weird because cultural institutions like the Whitney need so much money that 
people like Susan Hess with no art collection, education, sensibility or style can buy their way onto the board and chair 
a gala. 
The New York Timis sends photographer Bill Cunningham and the next Sunday her photo appears as a sociaVcultural 
doyenne and people begin to believe she is "special". Her gala was filled with tacky rich people like Bob Hurst- a 
complete jerk. The whole scene is a bad joke with the higher goal of cultivation of the arts. I have always had a very 
low regard for the manufactured "art scene". 
#3. Cannes, The Carlton...) went to four top designers and got the most gorgeous gowns. 1 have put together a schedule 
of the best films and parties. I am excited about writing my 3rd Cannes Diary...and already dreaming about the 
sounds of the bottle trundler at dawn outside my window overlooking the dark smelly alley. Just kidding. Just 
beyond grateful I am going.... 
Trying to lay low this weekend to get rid of my cold. Sending my idiot brother, his idiot wife, my idiot mother and my 
recovering niece to "Lend Me a Tenor" Sunday matinee and dreading meeting them at the hot Jean George restaurant 
in the new Mark Hotel. 
Home most of the day...xoxo Peg 
How are you feeling?
