and found that we could not communicate because.' mistakenly assumed that it was a discussion among family 
members while y=ur letters made it very clear and explicit that you saw it as a legal issu= to be settled among lawyers 
and Bainco, perhaps with a mediator in the ad=ersary proceeding. All matters I find it very hard to comprehend, an= to 
live with, but so be it. 
So by all means consult with y=ur lawyer, or perhaps a battery of lawyers, to make sure that your interes=s are properly 
protected. I don't need any lawyer's advice.=C2* The matter is perfectly clear and straightforward. So there is=no 
reason for me to hire a lawyer to deal with the question and to have a =awyer contact yours and initiate a discussion in 
which we all participate..C2* 
The matter is very simple. We can proceed without del=y if you agree to settle the issue in the simple manner that I 
suggested.<=div> 
As for your proposals in your letter of March 29, as I wrote=you, the letter was so shocking that it was hard for me to 
bring myself to=respond, but I did, in detail, but decided not to send it. Perhaps l=should. Will think about it. 
As for your proposals, m= response was the obvious one. I'm sorry for the stress you had =o endure, but your efforts 
were a waste of time for reasons I had already =ully explained before you undertook them. As I'm sure you recall= a few 
years ago, I requested tax payments from the marital trust when my =RA was being rapidly depleted by my advisers who 
were distributing half to=family and using the other half to pay management fees and taxes for the e=tire estate, so that 
to pay Alex's medical expenses and the expenses f=r Wellfleet I had to withdraw excess funds with exorbitant taxes, all 
that=before withdrawing even a cent to live on again with exorbitant taxes.0=A0 Your response was to refuse the 
request unless I agreed to intrusive an= insulting financial investigations -- of a kind I never considered when p=oviding 
funds to you for something you needed. I made it clear and e=plicit at the time that I would not submit to this 
procedure. Since =our efforts and proposals simply repeat the same procedure, they were a wa=te of time. 
There were some things in your letter that were=correct. You're right that despite what has happened, I'm st=ll a 
"wealthy man," with income well above the median, though la=king a pension and accumulated property, not at the 
level of my peers4=A0 Furthermore, I can supplement my income by teaching large undergraduate=courses, 
something I'd never done and that is not that common for peop=e approaching 90, but something that I enjoy. And you 
too are a weal=hy man, for the same reasons: the reasons are that I've worked hard al= my life, lived fairly simply (and 
live even more simply today), and was t=erefore able to put aside enough money to ensure that my children and 
gran=children are very well cared for, indefinitely.
