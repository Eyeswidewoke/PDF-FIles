Deutsche Bank will serve as one of the Placement Agents to the Access Funds. Deutsche Bank may charge 
a DB Introduced Person the DB Placement Fee in respect of each Subscription made by such DB Introduced 
Person. The DB Placement Fee may differ from placement fees charged to Investors introduced to the 
Access Funds by other Placement Agents as well as from those charged to other DB Introduced Persons. 
The DB Placement Fee may be waived or reduced by Deutsche Bank in respect of any particular DB 
Introduced Person without thereby entitling any other DB Introduced Person to a similar waiver or 
reduction. In addition, the Investment Manager will, in exchange for certain servicing functions rendered 
by Deutsche Bank, pay the Servicing Fee to Deutsche Bank in respect of each DB Introduced Person that is not 
in default of its obligations as described in the Partnership Agreement (including a DB Introduced Person who 
was in default of such obligations but cured such default), on an ongoing basis for so long as Deutsche Bank 
continues to provide such services with respect to such DB Introduced Person, as follows: (i) during the 
"investment period" of the Underlying Fund, the Servicing Fee in respect of each DB Introduced Person will be 
equal to the product of the amount of the aggregate Subscription of such DB Introduced Person to the Access 
Fund, multiplied by (a) if the aggregate Subscription of such DB Introduced Person to the Access Fund is less 
than $3 million, 0.65% per annum; (b) if the aggregate Subscription of such DB Introduced Person to the Access 
Fund is equal to $3 million or more but less than $5 million, 0.45% per annum; and (c) if the aggregate 
Subscription of such DB Introduced Person to the Access Fund is equal to or greater than $5 million, 0.05% per 
annum; (ii) after the end of the "investment period" of the Underlying Fund, through the second anniversary of 
the termination of the -investment period" of the Underlying Fund, the Servicing Fee in respect of each DB 
Introduced Person will be equal to the product of the amount of such DB Introduced Person's allocable share 
(based upon Subscriptions) of the Access Fund's Invested Capital, multiplied by (a) if the aggregate Subscription 
of such DB Introduced Person to the Access Fund is less than $3 million, 0.4875% per annum; (b) if the aggregate 
Subscription of such DB Introduced Person to the Access Fund is equal to $3 million or more but less than $5 
million, 0.36% per annum; and (c) if the aggregate Subscription of such DB Introduced Person to the Access 
Fund is equal to or greater than $5 million, 0.05% per annum; and (iii) thereafter until the last day of the term of 
the Access Fund, the Servicing Fee in respect of each DB Introduced Person will be equal to the excess of (x) 
the amount of any Management Fees collected by the Access Fund or the Investment Manager (as applicable) 
from such DB Introduced Person over (y) 0.20% of such DB Introduced Person's allocable share of Invested 
Capital. Finally, Deutsche Bank will also receive from the Glendower GP or an affiliate a placement fee 
equal to 0.75% of the portion of the Access Fund's aggregate capital commitment to the Underlying Fund 
attributable to the Subscriptions of each DB Introduced Person in respect of portion of the Access Fund's 
aggregate capital commitment to the Underlying Fund attributable to the Subscriptions of each DB 
Introduced Person. Deutsche Bank may or may not receive payment of similar fees (which may be lower 
or greater than fees received in connection with the placement of Interests in the Access Fund) with respect 
to the placement of interests in certain other funds established, sponsored or distributed by the General 
Partner, the Investment Manager, the Glendower GP or their respective affiliates, as well as others. 
Accordingly, the potential for Deutsche Bank to receive such fees in connection with the Access Funds 
may create an incentive for Deutsche Bank to recommend and market an investment into the Access Funds 
and presents a potential conflict of interest in recommending a direct or indirect investment in the Access 
Funds as compared to investments in other funds where Deutsche Bank may not receive such fees or may 
receive lower fees. Conversely, the prospect of receiving, or the receipt of, the fees described above, which 
may be less or different than fees associated with interests or shares of other funds or investment products 
offered by Deutsche Bank may provide Deutsche Bank and its sales persons with an incentive to favor sales 
of interests or shams of other funds or investment products over sales of Interests. In addition, certain 
clients of Deutsche Bank may invest directly in the Underlying Fund. Deutsche Bank will be paid a fee in 
respect of each such direct investor based on such direct investor's aggregate commitment to the Underlying 
Fund. Such direct investors will not bear the additional layer of fees and expenses to which DB Introduced 
Persons are subject. Deutsche Bank clients in esting directly in the Underlying Fund will be subject to the 
eligibility, suitability and minimum capital commitment requirements as determined by the Glendower GP. 
Prospective investors should take such fees, and the related potential conflicts of interest, into account when 
considering and evaluating any recommendations related to a direct or indirect investment in the Underlying 
Fund.
