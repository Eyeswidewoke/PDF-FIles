cause of the English Civil War t=at led to the creation of the United States. Obviously our current congressional 
representatives in Washington have loss sight that they serve at the pleasure of the people wh= voted them into office, 
and as such should enact their wishes. 
But let's not limit this to economic matters. In the wake of =he Newtown massacre, 90% of Americans, including almost 
80% of NRA members now believe that there shoul= be background checks on anyone purchasing a firearm, still with 54 
to 46 vote in-favor, gun control legislation was shelved. And with more than 11 million people living in America illegally, 
many for decades with children who were born here, supported by a majority of American favoring a passage to 
citizenship, congress still appears to be slow-walking legislation that would address this grievance. Obv=ously a major 
part of the problem is hyper-partisanship. But the Big U=ly is Republican leaders' desire/intention to make Obama a 
failed Pres=dent. As a result, I Agree with the President when he chides Congress telling them that they should act as 
adults. And l=urge everyone of you to make our political representatives know that the current dysfunctionality, will not 
=e tolerated and that there will be a price paid on Election Day.

Thi= week in Money Morning, journalist David Zeiler wrote — What A=erica's $2 Trillion Underground Economy Says 
About Jobs. Although I totally disagree with the premise of his article that Obamacare and other regulations enacted 
during current administration has caused the US undergr=und economy to balloon to $2 trillion annually. By 
"underground economy," Zeiler is talking about all the bu=iness activity that is not reported to the government, which 
includes a growing number of people getting paid for their labor in cash. 
My belief is that many in the underground economy are folks (like my mother who was a domesti= worker for fifty 
years), including handymen day-laborers, construction work=rs, childcare workers, illegal aliens and domestic maids like 
my mother. And most o= these people have been trapped in the underground economy for years. And the number one 
reason is that paying workers off the books has great appeal=to employers, who then can avoid paying benefits and 
taxes, as well as to get around regulations that protect workers' right. And as more people are now working from home 
or have had to take on second jobs, much of this increased business activity goes unreported. But t=e balloon is a result 
of comp=nies moving full-time employees to private contractor status, and the grow=h of many more working from 
home. 
Again: To suggest that Obamacare and increase regulations caused the underground economy to mushroom over the 
past couple=of years, is a totally fallacy, especially since Obamacare wasn't 
One of the proble=s with the main-stream press today, is that if the news isn't sensational it is ignored. =s such they 
concentrate on buzz words such as WMDs and foreign born terrorists, when the truth is that including 9/11 =errorists 
have killed 3,033 people in America while in the decade of 2000 to 2010 445,000 people have died as a result of traffic 
accident, 485,000 patients have die= from hospital infections, (not infecti=ns that you came in the hospital with but 
infections contracted when, of instance a doctor wearing a tie that got into your soup). But the most da=gerous place is 
your couch, because three million people died as a result of obesity related diseases. The World Health Organization 
says that 150,000 people die every year from immediate causes as a result o= the environment And 13 people go to 
work every day =ho don't come home because of work-related accidents, while the Home Land Security budget=is $60 
billion and the EPA budget is $8 billion a year. Shouldn't=nbsp;the main-stream media try a little harder to explain to 
people what is really killing them, instead of them playing to the cheap seats.
