want a distraction in whic= suddenly Iran can portray itself as a victim?" He also said he would try to convince 
Netanyah= that the only way to bring about a permanent end to a country's nuclear p=ogram is to convince the country 
in question that nuclear weapons are not =n its best interest. "Our argument is going to be that it is important for us to 
see if we can solve this thing permanent=y, as opposed to temporarily," he said, "and the only way histor=cally that a 
country has ultimately decided not to get nuclear weapons wit=out constant military intervention has been when they 
themselves take [nuclear weapons] off the table. That's what hap=ened in Libya, that's what happened in South Africa." 
And=though broadly sympathetic to Netanyahu's often-stated fear that Iran's nu=lear program represents a Holocaust-
scale threat to the Jewish state, and the Jewish people, Obama suggested strongly that =istorical fears cannot be the 
sole basis for precipitous action: "The=prime minister is head of a modern state that is mindful of the profound c=sts of 
any military action, and in our consultations with the Israeli government, I think they take those costs, =nd potential 
unintended consequences, very seriously." Bu= when I asked the president if he thought Israel could damage its 
reputati=n among Americans with an attack on Iran -- an attack that could provoke Iranian retaliation against American 
targets, an= could cause massive economic disruption -- he said, "I think we in t=e United States instinctively sympathize 
with Israel." President Obam= also shared fascinating insights about his sometimes tension-filled relationship with 
Netanyahu -- and spoke at lengt= about Syria -- but for that, you'll have to read the entire interview. He=e is a transcript 
of our conversation: 
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: From what we understand, Prime Minister Netanyahu =s going to ask you for some specific 
enunciations of red lines, for specif=c promises related to the Iranian nuclear program. What is your message to=the 
prime minister going to be? What do you want to get across to him? 
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: First of all, it's important to say that I d=n't know exactly what the prime minister is going 
to be coming with. We ha=en't gotten any indication that there is some sharp "ask" that i= going to be presented. Both 
the United States and Israel have been in constant consultation about a very difficult issue= and that is the prospect of 
Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. This is some=hing that has been one of my top five foreign-policy concerns since I 
came=into office. We, immediately upon taking over, mapped out a strategy that said we are going to mobilize the 
=nternational community around this issue and isolate Iran to send a clear =essage to them that there is a path they can 
follow that allows them to re=oin the community of nations, but if they refused to follow that path, that there would be 
an escalating ser=es of consequences. Three years later, we can look back and say we h=ve been successful beyond 
most people's expectations. When we came in, Ira= was united and on the move, and the world was divided about how 
to address this issue. Today, the world is as =nited as we've ever seen it around the need for Iran to take a different p=th 
on its nuclear program, and Iran is isolated and feeling the severe eff=cts of the multiple sanctions that have been 
placed on it. At the same time, we understand that the bot=om line is: Does the problem get solved? And I think that 
Israel, understa=dably, has a profound interest not just in good intentions but in actual r=sults. And in the conversations 
I've had over the course of three years, and over the course of the last three =onths and three weeks, what I've 
emphasized is that preventing Iran from g=tting a nuclear weapon isn't just in the interest of Israel, it is profoun=ly in the 
security interests of the United States, and that when I say we're not taking any option off the=table, we mean it. We 
are going to continue to apply pressure until Iran t=kes a different course. 
GOLDBERG: Go back to this language, 'All options on the table.' You'=e probably said it SO or 100 times. And a lot of 
people believe it, but th= two main intended audiences, the supreme leader of Iran and the prime min=ster of Israel, you 
could argue, don't entirely trust this. The impression we get is that the Israeli gover=ment thinks this is a vague 
expression that's been used for so many years.=Is there some ramping-up of the rhetoric you're going to give them? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think the Israeli people understand it, I think t=e American people understand it, and I think the 
Iranians understand it. 1= means a political component that involves isolating Iran; it means an eco=omic component 
that involves unprecedented and crippling sanctions; it means a diplomatic component in which we have =een able to 
strengthen the coalition that presents Iran with various optio=s through the P-5 plus 1 and ensures that the IAEA 
(International Atomic E=ergy Agency] is robust in evaluating Iran's military program; and it includes a military 
component. And I think=people understand that. I think that the Israeli government recogniz=s that, as president of the 
United States, I don't bluff. I also don't, as=a matter of sound policy, go around advertising exactly what our intentions 
are. But I think both the Iranian =nd the Israeli governments recognize that when the United States says it i=
