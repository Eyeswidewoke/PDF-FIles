Nintendo's first party switch software continues to impress. Nintendo has four first party Switch games with a 
Metascore above 90 (out of 100). Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild both have a 
Metascore of 97, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Bayonetta 2 both scoring 92. As we have often said, through our 
thematic work on the industry, it is compelling content and engagement which drives the eGaming cycle and in the 
performance of these titles Nintendo has delivered. 
On Friday, media outlets reported that the extremely popular Fortnite Game was likely coming to Switch. It was 
spotted that the game was on a ratings application from publisher Epic Games for the Nintendo Switch platform at the 
Korean Game Rating and Administration Committee, one of the final steps before launch. The very design of the game is 
for it to be device agnostic and we know that an Android version is in the works to complement the PC, iOS, Xbox and 
PlayStation formats. With the unique controller gaming experience of the Switch and the portability option this could 
end up being a goldmine and accelerate adoption, if it were to happen. 
Nintendo's earnings profile remains resilient. The stock continues to enjoy high earnings revisions rankings 
relative to global equities (Stoxx Global 1800 used in the illustration.

Facebook (Sell): habits are changing. There may be trouble ahead 
A new survey released by eMarketer on Friday shows that for US users who are sharing less with friends and 
family on the platform it is often because of trust. 47% of such respondents said that the reason was due to privacy 
concerns. It comes after a Gallup poll last month showed that 43% of Facebook users were very worried about the 
invasion of privacy. Now this may not manifest into platform behaviour changes yet but the first effect could be to see 
slowing DAU/MAU metrics and lower engagement. In turn, this could lead to marketers questioning the digital ROI of 
the platform. As we mentioned last week, we see evidence of Twitter attempting to capitalise by introducing a new 
timeline ad campaign for publishers as the company shifts deeper into programmatic ads.

Zynga (Buy): complementary deal and margin uplift ahead 
The key push v pull argument on Zynga has been on how the company will get to a stated aim of a 20% adjusted 
EBITDA margin. The company is executing on the progress of the same and this week's acquisition of Gram Games 
should help achieve that target with projected EBITDA contribution of $12M in 2018 and $20M in 2019. The price of the 
deal at $250M seems reasonable and will bring in a 75 person studio in London and Istanbul that fits into the Zynga 
strategy of connecting interactive entertainment with players. Gram has success in building hyper-casual games and 
Merge games. The Merge series uses the mechanic of merging two puzzle pieces together to solve a puzzle and is a 
mechanic that makes free-to•play games easy and addictive. 
The strategic shift towards live services is paying off, with frequent content updates driving higher average 
revenue per user and engagement. Audience numbers are on the rise with DAU's up +19% YoY and MAU's +30% YoY. 
Zynga guided Q2 adjusted EBITDA to $37M above consensus (Factset) $35.7M, and the Q2 guidance implies the 
company is on track with adjusted EBITDA margin of 18% expected for Q2. Zynga has now delivered EBITDA upside for 
eight straight quarters.

Salesforce.com (Buy): no slowing in sight 
Salesforce.com, despite high expectations, still managed to beat and raise. 10 revenue of $$3.018 was ahead of 
consensus (Factset) $2.948 driven by subscription beat ($.281B above $2.73B expected), Non GAAP OM of 17.1% 190bps 
above street. Raise FY guidance for revenues of $13.075-$13.1258 and EPS of $2.29-$2.31 above consensus $12.73B and 
$2.12. Company revenue run rate of $12B/year, growing 25% YoY. A quite remarkable feat — we remember when it 
reached $18 in 2009 and $5B in 2014. Artificial Intelligence, through its Einstein assistant, is delivering nearly 2 billion 
predictions every day and its ease of use is seen as key driver of adoption. This is almost double the number in February
