"Absolutely." Gates sat upright and raised his arms in the air. "Absolutely. Hey. Being in the spotlight is a corrupting 
thing. Being successful is a corrupting thing. Having lots of money is a corrupting thing. These are very dangerous things, 
to be guarded against carefully. And I think that's very, very hard to do." 
"How do you do it?" 
"I'm very close to my family. And that's important to me. It's a very centering thing. I live in the same neighborhood I 
grew up in. One of my sisters lives there. We get together as a family a lot. The woman I'm marrying wants when we 
have kids to have a normal environment for them. So we'll mutually brainstorm about how to do the =best we can at 
that." Gates thought for a while, then said, "I am a person who is very conscious of, like, why don't I have a N in my 
house? I think N is great. When I'm in a hotel room, I sit there and try all these new channels and see what's going on. I 
probably stay up =too late watching stuff. N is neat. I don't have a N at home, because = would probably watch it, and I 
prefer to spend that time thinking-or, =mostly, reading. So I'm pretty conscious about not letting myself get used to 
certain things." 
"So do you consider yourself a puritanical person?" 
"Oh, no no no. I'm not a puritan," Gates said. "Hey, if I was a puritan--" He grinned, apparently mentally flipping through 
= sequence of unpuritanical acts he had committed. "O.K., it's a little =bit like this. I go to a baseball game, and I'm 
having a good time, watching the game, but then I feel myself getting drawn in. I start wondering, Who are these guys? 
Who are the good ones? How much are they =paid? How are the other teams compared to this one? How have the rules 
=changed? How do these guys compare to the guys twenty years ago? It just gets so interesting. I know if I let myself go 
to ten games I'd be addicted, and I'd want to go more. And there's only so much time in the =day. And, frankly, it's easy 
for me to get interested in anything. I think, Gosh, am I going to get good at tennis? Well, we got these kayaks recently. I 
think, you know, Are we going to get into that? I was just =in Africa. I think, Should I do my next two or three trips there-
-there's just so much there--but I'd sort of like to go to China, =and actually I think I'll end up doing that for my next big 
trip, in two or three years. So there's all these choices, but time is this very scarce resource." 
As we were saying goodbye, Gates said, "Well, you're welcome to keep =ending me mail." 
I walked out to my car, drove off the Microsoft campus, and headed back over the Evergreen Bridge to Seattle. When I 
got to my hotel, I logged on and saw I had E-mail from Bill. It had been written about two hours after I left his office. 
There was no reference =to our having just met. He was responding to mail I had sent him several days earlier, asking 
what he thought of Henry Ford: 
Ford is not that admirable--he did great things but he was very very narrow minded and was willing to use brute 
force power too much. His relationship with his family is tragic. His model of the world was plain wrong in a lot of ways. 
He decided he knew everything he needed to fairly early in his life.
