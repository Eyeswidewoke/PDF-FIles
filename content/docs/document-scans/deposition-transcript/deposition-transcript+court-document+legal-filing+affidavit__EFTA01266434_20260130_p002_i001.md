E. 
I reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, to transfer to my 
Trustees, by gift, by Will or by beneficiary designation, such additional property, including life 
insurance policies, as I may desire. Any such additional property shall be held on the same 
terms as are then applicable to the original Trust Estate, except that it may be transferred 
subject to conditions and provisions of special application to such additional property. 
Article I I : After My Death 
The following provisions shall apply after my death: 
Section 2.1. - Payment of My Debts and of Taxes and Expenses 
My Trustee shall pay from the principal of the Trust Estate (a) my debts, funeral and 
burial expenses and the administration expenses of my probate estate which are not paid by the 
Executor of my probate estate, and (b) the federal and state estate, inheritance, succession, 
generation skipping and similar taxes imposed by reason of my death which are the obligations 
of my Trustees (including any of such taxes which the Executor of my probate estate directs 
my Trustees to pay by written direction delivered to my Trustees). For purposes of this Section 
2.1, the principal of the Trust Estate shall not include (a) any assets which are not included in 
my Gross Estate or (b) any assets which are not subject to, or available to creditors for the 
payment of, my debts, my funeral and burial expenses or the administration expenses of my 
probate estate. 
Section 2.2. — Specific Bequests and Devises under My Will and Trust 
If my probate estate is insufficient to satisfy all pecuniary bequests (or bequests payable 
in cash or in kind in the discretion of the Executor of my probate estate) provided in my Will, if 
any, my Trustee shall pay such unpaid bequests from the principal of the Trust Estate. If my 
Will provided for a specific bequest or devise of specified assets and such bequest or devise 
could not be satisfied from my probate estate because such assets were held by my Trustee at 
my death, my Trustee shall distribute such assets to satisfy such bequest or devise. 
To the extent the assets of the Trust are insufficient to satisfy all bequests, I direct my 
Trustees to pay all specific bequests first, and to the extent assets are insufficient to pay all of 
the remaining bequests in Section 2.3(AXI) through 2.3(A)(1)(28), then the beneficiaries of 
Section 2.3(AX1) through 2.3(A)(IX28) shall share on a proportionate basis in the remaining 
estate assets available for distribution. The determination of the Trustees as to the amounts 
distributable herein shall be binding on all parties.
