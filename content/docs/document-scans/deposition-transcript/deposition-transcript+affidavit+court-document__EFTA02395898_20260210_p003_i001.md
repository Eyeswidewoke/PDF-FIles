Does wishing me well means not taking any news from me=at all ? Here is a

grandm=ther dying in front of me ( one of the most painful things I've ever e=perienced ), dealing with doctors, funerals, 
had to move tones of st=ff alone from my house without knowing where to go and still now sle=ping on a coach without 
a room on my own ( my mother rented my room for a =ear in Rome so I don't even have a real home where to go ) 
Working 12h=per day as a babysitter in order to earn some money because it's the o=ly paying job I found without a 
degree after asking everyone I knew. In ad=ition trying to keep up with the photographer.. I promise I'm trying m= best 
to be strong and stay positive but managing all this alone at 20 yea=s old with no moral support and a broken heart is 
hard, specially after l&=39;ve loved you so much with every part of myself and still do now... (I g=ess this is the reason 
you've pushed me away). Anyways I don't wan= to whine but just let you know that even in this hard situation I'm d=ing 
the best I can to grow and survive. I love you
