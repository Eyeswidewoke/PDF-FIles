• 
Always carry some form of =ommunication equipment, such as a cellular phone programmed with 
=umbers that would be useful in an emergency (police, embassy, =nternational SOS Assistance Centre, etc►. 
• 
Understand =he basic geography of your destination, and ensure you familiarise =ourselves with key 
routes: avoid high-crime or low-income areas if =ossible. If you find yourself disorientated, be discreet when =onsulting 
a map — or ask for directions from someone in a =ublic, client-facing role, such a shop assistant or police =fficer. 
• 
Avoid disputes, demonstrations, political =allies and commotions on the street. Do not stay to watch or 
photograph =hem. 
• 
Carry cash in more than one pocket, and keep a =mall amount in a top pocket to hand over to a criminal 
who confronts =ou. A dummy wallet — with a small amount of local currency, an =xpired credit card and some useless 
receipts — can be useful to =atisfy a mugger. 
• 
Where possible, obtain small =enominations of currency and keep the bulk of cash and cards in a money 
=elt, which should only be accessed in private places. 
• 
Ignore verbal 'bait' from passers-by — do not =et into an argument — and avoid eye contact with 
strangers. If =ou suspect that you are being followed, enter any busy public place and =all for help. 
* 
Maintain a high level of information =ecurity. Do not give out personal information. Do not discuss your 
=tans with strangers. Do not carry unnecessary amounts of information, =ither in hard copy or on laptops, removable 
drives etc. 
Memorise important local phrases (yes, no, how much, stop =ere etc). 
• 
Be alert to your surroundings: if =ossible, understand the pattern of life, and be alert for — and =eady to 
respond to changes. 
• 
Limit your alcohol =ntake: it is likely to reduce your level of awareness and =udgment. 
• 
Do not accept food or drinks from =trangers. Always keep your food and drink in sight in entertainment 
=enues. 
ADDITIONAL ADVICE FOR WOMEN TRAVELLERS 
• 
Call for advice from our security specialists if you have any =oncerns about the risks you might face in a 
given destination. 
• 
Observe and respect local clothing customs. Dress modestly to =void drawing attention. 
• 
In some countries, a lone =emale traveller is a source of curiosity: you may be stared at if =ravelling 
alone. As a precaution, avoid eye contact with strangers, =specially on the street and on public transport. If travelling 
alone, =estrict evening entertainment to business-class hotels or membership =tubs. 
• 
A wedding ring — even a fake one —=can reduce levels of unwanted male attention. 
• 
Decline =olitely but firmly any invitations which make you feel uncomfortable, =ven if faced by amicable 
pressure to accept. 
• 
Ignore =uggestive comments. 
• 
Some hotels offer women-only =loors; ask about them when you book your room. Ensure your hotel 
only =Vows guest access to accommodation floors. You might want to consider =sing a door wedge and/or portable 
alarm for extra security. 
• 
Check the available transport options at your destination, =nd if there are any additional precautions 
advised for women — =uch as not using a taxi alone, or where to sit on a =us. 
ADDITIONAL ADVICE FOR LGBT TRAVELLERS 
Homosexuality is illegal in many countries. Additionally, =ocial attitudes in many countries can result in 
harassment of lesbian, =ay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) groups; harassment is also =requently reported in countries 
where same-sex relationships are =egal. 
The following steps can be taken to minimise the =ikelihood of encountering social, legal or physical 
consequences =rising from your sexual orientation:
