*=A0 Having money, financial power is not equal to having a public vehicle=C2* with reams of 
disclosures. legal minefields . all good f=r lawyers and bankers but certainly not the best path for a SOVEREIG=. 
a) money needs .=C2* -- domestic and int'l*=A0 / should the kingdom consider its own internal 
currency*=A0 in addition to world currency. like the IMF , specia= depository receipts. these SDRs wer= created for 
a specific purpose. the equivalent can be created for =A internal use. note any solution that does not take i=to 
account the vast increases in computer power and Internet =span>ie the public offering of Aramco should be 
immedi=tely suspicious. The military would never use weapons of the 60s in =oday's battles , so it should not use 
antiquated solutions to th= financial problems of today. 
b.*=A0 the kingdom can issue debt backed by oil, currency e=changeable into oil. ? it would be 
the strongest currency quickly a= most countries today are merely fiat. 
=c. investment in infra structure MUST take into account=that are now living in a ZERO interest 
rate environment. =Saudi , china and Russia , could begin to use other complementary currenci=s that would stay 
outside of the US banking system, a system t=at is often used as a hammer. 
2 . =cting as a large sovereign wealth fund, is antiquated. there i= not shortage of huge amounts of 
capital and merely competing with hundred= of the most sophisticated investors is a losing game. H=WEVER the 
country is a SOVEREIGN. this is the bigg=st asset. not its wealth alone. Sovereign nations are the only=entities that 
can issues world wide accepted currencies . most=nations that have considered this are asset poor , so the currency is 
virt=ally worthless. SA presents a unique opportunity.=C2* 
What will the money be used for? =C2* why have the 
same money for military equipment from another co=ntry as the money the local Jeddah resident uses=to buy milk/ 
3 operational , I =ould not take Aramco public. I however would use it to r=ise money. . 
4k=A0 
=C2* 
I would take whatever step= necessary to bring the high knowledge base in 
tech, medicine, education t= the Kingdom. physically bring people there will NOT wor=. there is no need to have 
geographic limitations. =C2* ie the Chinese have seeded many people and=cos in their drive to bolster their seat at 
the world financial tabl=. SA can do the same. Knowledge is the mobile valuable c=mmodity, exchange oil for land, 
knowledge and currencies.
