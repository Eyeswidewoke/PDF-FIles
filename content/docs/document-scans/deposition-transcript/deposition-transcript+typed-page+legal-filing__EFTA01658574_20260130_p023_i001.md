me. And they do. And, frankly, I'm not telling them to back up." Hallie Jackson said on NBC 
Nightly NewsVi (10/8, story 3, 1:20, Holt, 5.56M) that the White House "still refuses to say 
when the President last tested negative for the virus, a key data point for determining who else 
could be at risk. ... We learned tonight that several of the President's top aides, including son-
in-law Jared Kushner, joined him in the Oval Office today, according to a senior White House 
official. All they say wearing full PPE." 
The AP (10/8, Madhani, Colvin, Perrone) reports the President "insisted Thursday that he 
is ready to resume campaign rallies and feels `perfect,' but the White House has offered little 
information about his condition one week after his diagnosis with the coronavirus that has killed 
more than 210,000 Americans." The AP says Trump "is trying to shift his focus to the election 
that's less than four weeks away." But he "has not been seen in public - other than in White 
House-produced videos - since Monday and his doctors have provided few medical details since 
before his release from a military hospital." 
Reuters (10/8, Mason, Holland) reports the President said "he may return to the campaign 
trail with a rally on Saturday after the White House physician said he had completed his course 
of therapy for the novel coronavirus and could resume public events." Trump said in an 
interview on Fox News' Hannity (10/8, 535K), "I think I'm going to try doing a rally on Saturday 
night if we have enough time to put it together. But we want to do a rally probably in Florida on 
Saturday night. I might come back and do one in Pennsylvania the following night. It's 
incredible what's going on. I feel so good." Earlier, Trump said on Fox Business' Mornings With 
Maria (10/8), "I am back because I am a perfect physical specimen and I am extremely young." 
USA Today (10/8, Rossman, Aretakis, 10.31M) reports White House physician Sean 
Conley "cleared Trump to return to public life on Saturday" in a memo released by the White 
House on Thursday evening. Conley wrote, "Saturday will be day 10 since Thursday's diagnosis, 
and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully 
anticipate the President's safe return to public engagements at that time." Politico (10/8, 
Goldberg, Ollstein, Roubein, 4.29M) reports that Trump campaign surrogates have been 
"fanning out to battlegrounds like Arizona, Florida, Nevada and North Carolina" in Trump's 
absence, "and while many events are outdoors, some have not followed state and city limits on 
large crowds, the campaign isn't requiring face coverings and social distancing doesn't appear 
to be enforced." 
The New York Times (10/8, Grynbaum, Vigdor, 18.61M) reports Conley said Trump "has 
remained `stable' and `devoid' of symptoms that would suggest the illness was progressing." 
The Washington Times (10/8, 492K) reports Conley said Trump's heart rate "is 69 beats per 
minute and his blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen rate remain normal." Townhall (10/8, 
Stocking, 177K) reports Conley said Trump had "blood pressure of 127/81 mmHg, a respiratory 
rate of 15-17 breaths per minute, and a pulse oximetry of 96-98 percent room air." 
Politico (10/8, Choi, 4.29M) says the President's diagnosis "threw a wrench into the 
campaign's plans, notably with the transition of the second presidential debate into a virtual 
affair. ... Still, the president has had time to get his voice heard from his White House 
confinement. In the days following his hospital stay, he has been particularly active on Twitter 
and engaged in a lively Thursday interview" with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo. 
The Washington Post (10/8, Olorunnipa, Parker, Dawsey, 14.2M) writes that Trump —
"trailing in the polls, stricken with the novel coronavirus and stuck in isolation at the White 
House" — has "tried to project an image of strength and normalcy that belies his troubled 
circumstances. On Thursday, he spent an hour phoning into a television interview, released two 
video messages aimed at key voting groups, began planning rallies for next week and promised 
senior citizens free access to the experimental drug he falsely claimed was `a cure' for covid-
19." 
White House Deputy Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern said on KTRH-AMVi Houston 
(10/8, 16K), "The President himself received Regeneron, which he has said was a terrific help 
that gives you antibodies to fight the virus. ... He's recovered really quickly. He's had no
