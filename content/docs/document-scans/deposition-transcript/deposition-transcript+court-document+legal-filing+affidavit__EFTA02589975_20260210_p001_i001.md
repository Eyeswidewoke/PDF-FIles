I am mortified that yo= were upset by the condition of the house.

I fully understand you= view and have taken immediate steps to remedy the conditions you noted. (See bel=w). 
</=pan> 
There are items=on your list which I was aware of but did not intend to address as urgently but I have n=w done 
so now such as (a) making the entrance more important, (b) the pool to dock steps, (c) removing the old furniture which 
certainly is deteriorated and (=) cleaning up disused flower pots and other detritus and 9e0 ge=erally cleaning up 
unsightly conditions. 
Specifically, I have t=ken the following actions in response and will evidence this by emailed photos by t=e end 
of the week: 
1. All outside furniture will be =emoved tomorrow together with disused flower planters and detritus in outside 
lower level utility closets. Robens (who a=so gardens) and a helper will come tomorrow with a truck and trailer to cart 
t=is away. The insides of the utility closets will also be cleaned up 40=804k this is one area where Janusz may be helpful. 
Perhaps he can paint the insides of t=ese with garage paint to shine up. I would like to ask Janusz to work with Albe=t 
Cano on this and I will put them in touch. 
2. The side walkways (two on nort= side) are being pressure washed again including the mildewed wall copings. 
Thi= had been done in the spring but will be put on a regular schedule. 
3. The nonconforming "decorative=quot; stairs are being expedited. The existing stairs were always 
nonconforming, not required by code and so ridiculously steep as to be unuseable. I have considered what to do with 
replacing them with something appropriate because direct access to the dock from the pool level would be a very good 
addition. (We had studied several =edesign solutions for the pool area ranging from lowering the pool itself to 
=ecladding posts and columns with stone but discarded them (in part based on broker advice- see below) because they 
see=ed too expensive for the value add.) I had intended to replace the existing "stairs" with either (a) new wood s=airs 
of acceptable tread/riser proportions rendered in a Regency wood trellis style to match o=her wood trellis features on 
facade of the house (my preference) or a spir=ling stair either in metal or wood. What is your preference? Either of 
these cho=ces seems a sensible resolution because either would be relatively inexpensive,=and because whether 
rendered in wood or metal, could be fabricated largely off site. I think either would be both architecturally appropriate 
and attracti=e. Albert has now asked (Canon Construction- working on Steve's house) to exp=dite working with Jackie 
Albarran (an architect on the Town landmarks commission) for sh=p drawings. I was deferring this stage until I knew
