Miami lawyer and British barrister Henk Milne represented William Toto, whom McMahan sued in 
1996 after the Ohio engineer had lost money in an investment with McMahan. 
"He served Bill in Florida at his vacation home: Milne said. "He made something like 49 attempts 
to serve him because, Bill always believed, he wanted to get him on vacation." 
Three and a half years later, a judge dismissed the lawsuit and ordered McMahan to pay Toto 
$265,000 that he had spent In legal fees fighting the case. Toto died of cancer shortly after the 
case ended. 
"He's basically a very wealthy stalker," Shani Robins tells New Times. Robins had been McMahan's 
latest target in court and is Linda's new boyfriend. He says McMahan is a bruiser in court "because 
he has the resources to do ft." 
In May, McMahan sued Robins in Superior Court in Connecticut, alleging wrongdoing when Robins 
accepted some donations Linda made from McMahan's National Cristina Foundation. (That lawsuit 
was also dropped as part of the September 13 settlement.) 
Consistent with his litigious past, McMahan fought his daughter and son-in-law's lawsuits 
aggressively. But they fought back with what appeared to be solid evidence. 
Court records show, for example, that in Sargent Schutt's lawsuit against McMahan, his attorney 
had a "rabbit" vibrator Schutt found in Linda's luggage tested for DNA. According to the test 
results, skin cells from Linda and sperm cells from her father were found on the device and its 
black cover. Five other vibrators were also sent to labs for testing. 
Through a spokesman, McMahan responded that he believed the evidence was "fabricated" but 
didn't elaborate. He also made allegations in court that his e-mail had been altered. 
Also, after spending more than a decade integrating her into the family, McMahan has now 
questioned in court records whether he is Linda's father. 
Ex-wife Melinda Ewell tells New Times that McMahan never had any doubt Linda is his daughter. 
'There was never a question," she said. "She looks like some of the other kids. He had no qualms.** 
Some of McMahan's extended family did have their doubts. His eldest daughter, Alison McMahan, 
says she never trusted Linda. 
"All I can tell you is that nothing Linda will tell you can be believed,' she tells New Times in an e-
mail. "She is an unreal person who does not even know herself.** 
Ewell, no fan of McMahan after their nasty divorce in 1984, can't quite believe the man slept with 
his oWn daughter. 
"How much of this is reality, I don't know," Ewell said. "There is a far greater chance that this is in 
her head. Way, way back when, I noticed she was very possessive of him. At my son's wedding 
eight to ten years ago, she really hung around him, and if anyone else was trying to talk to Bruce, 
she would try and get his attention. She would move in. From what I have observed, money 
appears to be the motivator.-
McMahan makes that allegation in his lawsuit against Linda and Schutt, claiming that he was the 
victim of an extortion scheme. But he apparently never made a formal complaint to law 
enforcement about the conspiracy against him. One of his attorneys, Angela Agrusa, says that a 
San Diego prosecutor considered the extortion allegations while investigating charges that Schutt 
had hit Linda during a July 2005 argument over who owned the computers containing the e-mails 
and photos detailing Linda and McMahan's love affair. 
But the case was dropped, Agrusa says, because Linda decided not to testify against Schutt.
