Re item 6: You report on ASU'= response to item #6, without including the fact that the University =pecifically 
stated there were never any allegations of sexual =isconduct or harassment by me at the University, and moreover that 
the =outside complaints' were in fact related specifically to your item #6. =nbsp; Further you neglect to mention that 
this complaint was by an =nonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed, =ho never lodged a 
complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided =f the alleged transgression. I was surprised and dismayed that 
=oth ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was =old by both Universities that because of my high 
profile even such =nsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to =he University would be 
investigated. The complaint was =nvestigated by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion =hat it was not 
credible and no university policies had been violated. =nbsp;ln addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month, 
=ound various inconsistencies in the allegation, which suggest =istortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU 
report. The =nitial complaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of =y position at ANU until it was 
dismissed, outlined the claim you made =n the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also =tated 
"It=is the University's understanding that a complaint was =odged directly to the conference organisers at the 
time of the =ncident." 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I =as not to interact with anyone on campus (again 
moot because I was a =emisphere removed) the final report, from which I quote below absolved =e of any wrongdoing, 
reinstating my position, and indicated information =nconsistent with the original claim and apparent later =laims: 
"The =llegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The =omplaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference =ttendee who was allegedly touched 
in 
an =nwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee =ho took the 'selfie' photo did not lodge a formal =omplaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the =ime of the incident (November 2016). 
- The =onference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal =omplaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the =ime of the incident (November 2016). 
-The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide =vidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant =lleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the =onference attendee who 
took 
the 'selfie' =hoto. This photo was not made available to the Australian National =niversity, although it was 
requested 
in the =ourse of the investigation." 
(And for the record I often put my hand up =n front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request =elfies 
not to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a =eries bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour. 
=nbsp;Moreover, I have no idea if the other eyewitnesses you quote, who =ere not involved in any complaint, were in 
fact there but this was a =ormal banquet with individuals and their partners, which I attended =ong enough to agree to 
sign things and do selfies before leaving early =ecause I was tired. Even if I had any such intent it would have been 
=unacy to pose for selfies in front of a group and openly do such a =hing, including presumably in front of this person's 
partner, . =hich, besides the fact that I don't do such things, is one of =he many reasons it never happened.) 
What makes this particular type of =Ilegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of =elfies, 
and when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often =haking, or sometimes aggressive. I am particularly proud 
of the =ay I work to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than =umiliated, whatever their behavior or 
request. Thus, this false claim =trikes at the heart of what I am about, which characterizes all my =nteractions with fans: 
to acknowledge them in a way that makes them =eel appreciated and respected. As I understand you had a =eporter 
watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI conference =n Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will
