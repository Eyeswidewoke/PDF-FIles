time and place of such sale or purchase shall not be considered a waiver of 
the right to sell or buy without demand or notice 
as provided herein. Client further understands and agrees that if DBSI or 
Pershing permits Client a period of time in which to 
satisfy a call, the granting of that period of time shall not in any way 
waive or diminish the right of DBSI or Pershing to 
shorten the time period in which Client must satisfy the call, including an 
outstanding call, or to demand that a call be 
• satisfied immediately. Client further understands that liquidations may 
involve sales of positions in Client's Account(s) that are 
as great as the full indebtedness owed by Client. 
•8. Reg T Extensions. Client authorizes DBSI, at its discretion, to request 
and obtain extension(s) of Client's time to make 
payment for securities Client purchases, as provided for by Federal Reserve 
Bank Regulation T. 
9. Short Sales of Securities. Client understands that before executing a 
Short Sale, DBSI or Pershing is generally required to 
make an affirmative determination as to whether DBSI or Pershing will 
receive delivery of the securities from the Client or that 
the securities can be borrowed bythe settlement date. This process is 
commonly referred to as "obtaining a locate." If a 
sufficient quantity of securities is not available from inventory, DBSI or 
Pershing may, among other things, contact third-party 
lenders to ascertain whether they have securities available for lending. If 
a sufficient quantity of securities appears 
borrowable, DBSI or Pershing may proceed to execute the short sale on 
Client's behalf. A locate is simply an indication that, 
as of the time the locate is obtained, it appears that securities will be 
available for borrowing on the settlement date. A locate 
is not a guarantee that securities will actually be available for lending 
and delivery on the settlement date or that the lender 
will not thereafter require the return ofthe borrowed securities. If the 
securities are not available for borrowing for any reason 
by the settlement date, Clierit (as the seller) will "fail to deliver" to 
the purchaser. In that circumstance, a buy-in of the 
securities that were not timely delivered will occur on the morning of the 
third business day after normal settlement date and 
Client will be responsible for all losses and costs of the buy-in. See 
"Mandatory Close-Out of Short Sales" below. Client is 
ultimately responsible for the delivery of securities on the settlement date 
and for the consequences of a failure to deliver and 
the timely return of securities borrowed on Client's behalf including any 
losses incurred by DBSI or Pershing relating to such 
short sales. Short positions will be "marked to the market" weekly. If the 
aggregate value of all securities sold by Client 
appreciates, an amount equal to such appreciation will be transferred from 
Client's Margin Account to Client's short Account 
resulting in a debit entry in the Margin Account. If the aggregate value of 
all the securities sold short depreciates, an amount 
equal to such decline will be transferred from the cash account to the 
Margin Account resulting in a credit entry in the Margin
