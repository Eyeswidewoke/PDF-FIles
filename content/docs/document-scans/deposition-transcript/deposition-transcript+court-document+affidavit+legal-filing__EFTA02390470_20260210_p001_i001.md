Jeffrey pleeeaaase I'm =tuck. If I don't find a solution before June 1st I need to move to the=countryside 
( lhour from Rome ) because my mother rented my room to a girl=for a year. I would love to stay in Paris to continue 
working and followin= the path of photography but I cannot afford it anymore and don't have=a house after the 1st. I'm 
really alone having to manage everything...=it's impossible.

When I first met you I had no sense of money and reality, had a diff=rent mentality and was in a 
different situation... My emotions took over m= rational part and I became completely blind and stupid. I had different 
p=iorities. I was spending more time thinking about you, trying to find out =f you cared for me or not and distracting 
myself going to parties instead =f focusing how I would earn, manage my money and take my life seriously. I=know it's 
entirely my fault and I blame no one but myself. 
=div>Now that I took some distance and find myself in this situation, I und=rstand how stupid 
and careless I was. Today I'm like most people=asking for help, finding myself in a miserable place. To be honest I have 
=o idea of why I should be different from them and as most people do in thi= situation if I was given an opportunity I 
would size it straight away and=take it as seriously as possible in order to never fall again in this horr=ble place where I 
am now. I gave you all my reasons and motivations in my =revious messages. I'm desperately looking to flourish and as 
Insaid to=become the best version of myself. I would do anything for it. Now it'= only up to you to decide. I don't know 
why I'm still asking for y=ur help after all I have done or not done, I guess because hope is the str=ngest driving force 
that keeps people alive.
