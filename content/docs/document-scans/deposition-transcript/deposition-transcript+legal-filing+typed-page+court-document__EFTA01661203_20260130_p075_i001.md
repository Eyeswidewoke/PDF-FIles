payment Nto US dollars unless a particular rate is required by law. Please do not send post-dated checks. They wal be 
deposited upon receipt. Our acceptance of any payment marked with a restrictive legend will not ocerate as an accord and

electronically, at first presentment and any re-presentments, by transmitting the amount cf the check, routing number, 
account number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the check is not processable electronically or a 
less costly process is available. By submitting a check for payment, you authorize us to initiate an electronic debit from your 
bank or asset account. When we process your check electronically, your payment may be debited to your bank or asset 
account as soon as the same day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your bank or 
asset account statement. If we cannot collect the funds electronically we may issue a draft against your bank or asset 
account for the amount of the check Authorization for Electronic Payments: By using Pay By Comr3uter, Pay By Phone 
or any other electronic payment service of ours, you will be authorizing us to initiate an electronic debit M the financial

day. Allocation of Payments and Credits: Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits 
among Features and Charges on your Account in arty order and manner determined by us in our sole discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADS) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to calculate FC on your Account_ Under this method, we figure the FC on your Am-flint by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADS (as described below) for each Feature (includry current transactions). Different daily 
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (inck
g unpaid FC from previous billing periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, cr fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or °codes, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the billing 
period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
billing period and dvide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the ADS for the Feature. If you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avcsd additional FC en features included in this 
New Balance. If you multiply 
 ADS for each Feature by Me numbe variables in the billing period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the PC assessed on that Feature, except for 
ns caused by roundly. The total FC for the 
bitting period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account. This method or calculating the ADB 
and FC results in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies: If ou incur a Charge in a 
foreign currency, it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by us from customary banking sources, on the 
c0nversion date or the prior business day, In each Instance Increased by 2%. Ths conversion rate may differ from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such 
estabishments use. Billing Rights Summary:  In Caso of Errors or Ouestions About Your Bill: If you think your bill is 
incorrect, or if you need more information aWut atransaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the
