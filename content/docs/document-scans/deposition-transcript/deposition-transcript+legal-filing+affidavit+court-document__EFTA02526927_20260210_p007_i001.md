Subject: =C2* Response to your letter 
Still surpr=sed that you had the financial information about the apartment and our Tucson house, which we 
never provided to anyone, because it's no one's business, =ust as no one knew or raised any questions about earlier 
cases of purchase and sale. 
However, wh=ever provided you with the information left a few things out, like payments to the cooperative 
and the costs of the sale. When these are taken into account, you'll find that what we received suffices to cover t=e 
costs of our purchase of the apartment, a bad mistake, as I've alre=dy explained, since we obviously couldn't afford it, 
not having the funds from the sale of the Lexington house, as I had expected. There is a little left over for a small 
mortgage on a much less expensive place that we can afford. In the cooperative there are retired professors, but they 
are people who have pensions and had property that they could sell to buy the apartment. I had neither, as you know. 
Again, I do='t know why you brought this up at all, but more generally, don't understan= why you are persisting 
with this correspondence. As I've written =everal times, and shouldn't have to say, I've worked hard all my l=fe, set 
aside ample funds to ensure that my children and their families will be well taken care of, and think I have the right to 
spend my last years in peace and tranquility without being concerned with accounting for financial matte=s. I don't 
understand, but will respond to your letter. I.=99II also send a separate letter concerning some recent interchanges 
with Max, which you may or may or not have heard something about. 
I should say that your letter is not easy for me to read, and a response won't be easy to write, for reasons I've 
explained in earlier lette=s. In the first place, to repeat again, I'm amazed that we are having this correspondence at all, 
that we've wasted 5 minutes on this. I als= continue to be perplexed about the difference of style: I write you persona= 
letters, and when you respond to them (usually you don't, as in the prerent case), the letters read as though they are 
written by lawyers in an adversa=ial proceeding. On the matter of the loan to buy the Cambridge apartment, for 
example, I explained that the whole idea of a loan within a family seemed to me utterly surreal, and I agreed only 
because I assumed, mistaken=y, that the loan was for a few weeks until the Lexington house would be sold and would 
cover the costs of the apartment. If I had been paying attention, I would have known that I didn't own the Lexington 
house..=A0 If I had had a lawyer and financial adviser who were concerned with my situation, they would have 
informed me that the Lexington house was not mine, and since I had no funds to pay for a new place to live, I couldn'=t 
afford to buy an apartment in Cambridge near Harvard Square, surely not a coop with continual fees. That's what I
