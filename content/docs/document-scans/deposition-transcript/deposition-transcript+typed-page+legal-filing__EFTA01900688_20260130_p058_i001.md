is, any documents attached to or incorporated in the plaintiffs' complaint that are central to the 
plaintiff's claim for relief. Causey v. Sewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, Inc., 394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 
2004) (citing Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 224 F.3d 496, 498-99 (5th Cir. 2000)). 
Also, the Court is permitted to consider matters of public record and other matters subject to 
judicial notice without converting a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. See 
United States ex rd. Willard v. Humana Health Plan of Texas Inc., 336 F.3d 375, 379 (5th Cir. 
2003). II. Sovereign Immunity The defendants contend that sovereign immunity bars the 
plaintiffs' claims; they say that the plaintiffs have failed, in part, to request relief that is properly 
characterized as prospective, and, to the extent that they do request prospective relief, 
defendants contend that plaintiffs fail to plead an ongoing violation of federal law such that the 
Ex pane Young exception to sovereign immunity is inapplicable.8 The Court disagrees. 
"Sovereign immunity is the privilege of the sovereign not to 8 Defendants concede that plaintiffs 
seek prospective relief to the extent that they request removal of all class members from the sex 
offender registry and notification to agencies that they are no longer subject to registration or 
notification requirements. However, defendants suggest that the plaintiffs fail to allege an 
ongoing violation of federal law. 13 be sued without its consent." Virginia Office for Protection 
and Advocacy v. Stewart, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 1637 (2011Xholding that Ex pane Young exception 
to sovereign immunity permitted suit by independent state agency dedicated to advocacy for 
persons with disabilities against certain state officials sued in their official capacities, alleging 
violations of federal law by refusing agency access to records to which it was entitled under 
federal enabling statutes). The Eleventh Amendment bars suits by private citizens against a state 
in federal court. K.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 124 (5th Cir. 2010)(citing Hutto v. Finney, 437 
U.S. 678, 700 (1978)). This immunity protects state actors in their official capacities. Id. There 
is, of course, "an important limit" on the sovereign immunity doctrine: the iconic Ex pane 
Young exception "rests on the premise...that when a federal court commands a state official to 
do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the State for sovereign-
immunity purposes." Stewart, 131 S.Ct. at 1638; K.P., 627 F.3d at 124 (Ex pane Young "is 
based on the legal fiction that a sovereign state cannot act unconstitutionally[; t]hus, where a 
state actor enforces an unconstitutional law, he is stripped of his official clothing and becomes a 
private person subject to suit."); see also Will v. Michigan Dcp't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 
n.10 (1989Xnoting "[o]f course a state official in his or her official capacity, when sued for 
injunctive relief, would be a person under § 1983 because 14 'official-capacity actions for 
prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State"). Of course, as this Court 
previously noted, the Ex pane Young exception applies when the plaintiff demonstrates that the 
state officer has "some connection" with the enforcement of the disputed act. See Doe v. Jindal, 
No. 11-388, 2011 WL 3925042, at *5 (E.D. La. Sept. 7, 2011Xciting K.P., 627 F.3d at 124 
(citing Ex pane Young, 209 U.S. at 160), and noting that the purpose of the connection 
requirement is to prevent litigants from misusing the exception)). The Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of 
Appeals instructs: Ex Parte Young gives some guidance about the required "connection" 
between a state actor and an allegedly unconstitutional act. "The fact that the state officer, by 
virtue of his office, has some connection with the enforcement of the act, is the important and 
material fact, and whether it arises out of the general law, or is specially created by the act itself, 
is not material so long as it exists." Id. (quoting Ex pane Young, 209 U.S. at 157). But the 
defendants do not suggest that they lack the requisite connection with the enforcement of the 
continued registration requirement necessary to establish the applicability of the Ex pane Young 
exception to their sovereign immunity;9 rather, defendants contend only that not 9 Indeed,
