Education: Employees seek retraining and education from YouTube and online courses to keep up with new 
job requirements and pay off skyrocketing student loan debt. 
• 
Freelancing: Employees crave scheduling and work-from-home flexibility, and internet discovery of 
freelance work led it to grow 3X faster than total workforce growth. The on-demand workforce grew 23% in 2017 driven 
by Uber, Airbnb, Etsy, Upwork, and Doordash. 
• 
Transportation: People are buying fewer cars, keeping them longer, and shifting transportation spend to 
rideshare, which saw rides double in 2017. 
• 
Enterprise: Consumerization of the enterprise through better interfaces is spurring growth for companies 
like Dropbox and Slack. 
• 
China: Alibaba is expanding beyond China with strong gross merchandise volume, though Amazon still rules 
in revenue. 
• 
Privacy: China has a big opportunity as users there are much more willing to trade their personal data for 
product benefits than U.S. users, and China is claiming more spots on the top 20 internet company list while making big 
investments in Al. 
• 
Tech investment: We're at an all-time high for public and private investment in technology, while the top six 
public R&D + capex spenders are all technology companies (Amazon #1). 
Europe v U.S. Equities 
At the index level there remains a value disconnect between the US and Europe. The charts below show that 
while Europe trades at one Standard Deviation below its trend PIE (on 11.5x) the US trades at nearly a one Standard 
Deviation premium (on 19.8x). This led our Strategy team, through their monthly "Compass Points Product" (let us know 
if you'd like a copy) to focus on the best and worst combinations of value creation, valuation premiums and relative 
earnings momentum in Europe. A full detailed analysis of the same is available from our team, just let us know if you 
want it. Within the TMT arena we would highlight two stocks, one good and one bad. Logitech (Buy, eGaming basket) 
has great relative earnings momentum which remains top quartile and the stock has nearly "all blue bar champion" 
status. Daniel also highlights that the Value Track screen still highlights 50% three year upside and the Value Layers 
displays continued widening of EVA margins. (For any discussions of these methodologies or screens do get in touch 
with Daniel White (Daniel.white@mirabaud.co.uk <mailto:Daniel.white@mirabaud.co.uk> 
<mailto:Daniel.white@mirabaud.co.uk <mailto:Daniel.white@mirabaud.co.uk» ) for more on this. In contrast to 
Logitech comes Swisscom. Swisscom revisions remain worst in class, and the Trend PE valuation offers some 8% 3Y 
downside. Swisscom and other bond-like equities have of course been beneficiaries of ultra-low interest rates. Further 
local market due diligence highlights expensive price and less than stellar customer feedback.

Apple supply chain: Beware the ides of Dialog 
The risk for some time to Dialog was that Apple would internally produce PMICs (Power Management Integrated 
Circuits). Dialog's statement that Apple would dual source for PMICs this year means that either this has come to fruition 
earlier than expected (2019/20 was common thinking) or that Apple is dual sourcing externally (Maxim or ON Semi 
perhaps?). But this shift is a shape of things to come. While the stated 5% hit to revenues in 2018 the bigger question is 
what happens in 2019 and beyond? Design shifts, technology changes and Apple's preference to reduce single vendor 
risk all point to lower opportunities for Dialog next year. If 2019 saw a shift to a three vendor strategy (one internal, two 
external) with one per iPhone design then Dialog's business could shrink substantially. If Dialog managed to secure more 
sub•PMIC (explained below) but lost 2/3rds of PMIC main design this could see a $350-S500M hit revenue run-rate 
decline. 
Apple is 77% of revenues and all attempts to diversify both customers and products is slow and can't mask the 
fact that Dialog is heavily reliant on Apple business. Apple moving to dual source this year would probably imply that 
one of the iPhone configurations would be non-Dialog this year. Last month Dialog had completed designs for 2019 
based products and was being taped out to the wafer fabs. These are due to be sampled and validated in the second half
