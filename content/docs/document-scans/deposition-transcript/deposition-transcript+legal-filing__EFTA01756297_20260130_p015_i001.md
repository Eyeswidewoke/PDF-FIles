<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">2. <b>lt's a matter=of pride and principle for the regime. 
</b></span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">The regime has inve=ted far too much of its domestic legitimacy 
in defending Iran's &quotrigh=s&quot (defined as domestic enrichment) to completely capitulate now, reg=rdless of 
the pressure. The nuclear program and 
&quot;resistance to arrogant powers&quot are firmly imbedded in the Islam=c Republic's ideological raison d'etre. 
Khamenei, the ultimate decider on =he nuclear file, and the Revolutionary Guards will not give up on the prog=am 
altogether, for it could be a viewed by 
their supporters and opponents alike as a total defeat. </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">However, Khamenei m=y accept a deal that constrains Iran's 
nuclear program but still allows li=ited enrichment. Under such an agreement, he could tell the Iranian people= 81quot I 
said we never wanted nuclear weapons 
and I have issued a </span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="fon=-size:18.0pt">fatwa</span></span><span 
style="font-size:18.0pt"> (religi=us ruling) against them. I insisted that our rights be respected, and now =hey are.&quot 
But if Khamenei cries uncle 
and dismantles the entire program, how will he explain the billions invest=d and justify the years of sanctions and 
isolation to his people? What wou=d it all have been for? Khamenei likely fears such a humiliation more than=he fears 
economic collapse or targeted 
military strikes against his nuclear facilities. </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">3. <b>lf Iran does =ant to go nuclear, sanctions aren't going to 
stop it in time.</b> 
</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Although hawks beli=ve Tehran is on the ropes and that 
additional sanctions can force Iran to =ompletely dismantle its nuclear program, economic and nuclear timelines do='t 
align. To be sure, Iran's economy 
is in </span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="font-size:18.0pt"=dire straits</span></span><span style="font-
size:18.0pt">, and a desire =o alleviate the pressure is driving the regime's apparent willingness to n=gotiate more 
seriously. But despite the 
current pain, Iran is not facing imminent economic collapse. This may be a=dark period in Tehran, but Khamenei likely 
believes that Iran weathered wo=se times during the Iran-Iraq war. Some analysts have warned that Iran cou=d achieve 
a critical &quot;breakout 
capability&quot; -- the ability to produce fissile material for nuclear we=pons so fast that it could not be detected or 
stopped -- sometime in 
</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">mid-20=4</span></span><span style="font-
size:18.0pt">. Yet, even if the U.S. Co=gress goes forward with additional harsh sanctions, the regime is not like=y to 
implode before it reaches this technical 
threshold and, if it did, it might make little difference. Even the impris=ned leadership of the Green Movement and 
Iranian secularists opposed to th= Islamic Repomach. But if paired with meaningful 
</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">sancti=ns relief</span></span><span style="font-
size:18.0pt">, it has a much be=ter chance of success than insisting on the complete dismantling of Iran's=program. 
</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Washington should n=t accept a bad deal. But if we are to avoid 
the worst possible outcomes --=unconstrained enrichment leading to an eventual Iranian bomb or another ma=or war in 
the Middle East -- then a 
good-if-imperfect deal is preferable to no deal at all. </span></p>
