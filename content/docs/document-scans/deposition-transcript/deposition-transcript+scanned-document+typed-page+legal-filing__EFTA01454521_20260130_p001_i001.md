Early Morning Reid: Macro Strategy 
rupiah is poised to record its strongest three-day rally in about fourth months -
spurred by comments last week from the Bank of Indonesia that the country's 
trade balance returned to surplus in May. The AUDUSD is also poised for a 
solid gain (+0.25%) after the RBA maintained its neutral tone in today's policy 
meeting. 
The last trading day of 1H14 failed to bring with it any volatility associated with 
month-end and half-end portfolio rebalancing. Indeed, yesterday's S&P 500 
volumes were about half that compared to the last trading day of 1H13. Adding 
to that, the S&P 500 closed virtually unchanged at -0.04%, and for the record 
the last time we saw a gain or loss of more than 1% in the index was April 
16th. One theme to note though was the continued underperformance of 
European banks across the equity and credit spectrum. Yesterday's 
underperformance was sparked by a 17% fall in the stock of Banco Espirito 
Santo which is Portugal's largest bank. The price action was dictated by 
reports that regulators were concerned over corporate governance between 
the bank and other related companies and there were also reports that 
Luxembourg justice authorities had launched an investigation into one of the 
bank's holding companies (Reuters). Portuguese securities regulator banned 
naked short selling on the bank's stock for one day. The news weighed on 
Portuguese bond yields which added 8bp, and also on European banking 
stocks in general (-0.75% vs Stoxx 600 -0.09%). Peripheral bank credit traded 
about 3-5bp wider yesterday - and the European senior financials index (+2bp) 
underperformed Main (+1.375bp). The two credit indices were trading flat to 
each other in the middle of June but the recent underperformance of banks has 
pushed the basis back to nearly 6bp. We still think its likely that Fin Senior will 
trade through Main in H2 though. 
Across the Atlantic, there was focus on the Chicago PMI and home sales data, 
following which treasury yields spiked up briefly before retracing the move to 
be largely unchanged on the day. The US Chicago PMI was slightly below 
expectations 62.6 (vs 63.0 expected) and also below last month's 65.5. Still, 
our economists note that the PMI was consistent with a large snapback in 
growth in 02, and they noted the three-month to June average was 63.7 which 
is the highest since the three months to April 2011. The other regional activity 
indicator, the Dallas Fed manufacturing outlook rose to 11.4 (vs 8.5 expected 
and 8.0 prior). Pending home sales rose 6.1% MoM (1.5% expected) which 
benefited US homebuilders on the equity side (+1.5% yesterday). In terms of 
Fed speak, the SF Fed's Williams commented that a first rate hike in 2H15 will 
be appropriate, but he also reiterated that it may be optimal for the Fed to let 
inflation run above target in order to balance the Fed's dual mandate. 
Perhaps one of the key themes of 1H14 was the surging M&A activity globally. 
With 1H14 books closed, the final M&A tally was $2.2trillion according to 
Bloomberg which is a YoY increase of 77%. By region, leading the way was the 
resurgence of corporate activity in Europe (+1090/0 YoY), though this was 
coming off a low base, followed closely by North America (+79%). In terms of 
industry the biggest pickup in activity came in pharma (+677%) and healthcare 
(+140%). One reason for the surge in M&A has been the accommodative 
capital markets. We saw an example of that yesterday with a jumbo bond deal 
from Oracle who priced S10bn in bonds (the second largest USD offering in the 
year-to-date according to Bloomberg) to fund the purchase of Micros Systems. 
The deal was sufficiently large to drag other TMT bonds several basis points 
wider on the day. 
Looking at some of the geopolitical headlines, Ukrainian President Poroshenko 
said late on Tuesday that we would end the cease-fire with pro-Russian rebels 
and vowed to intensify military operations in the country's east. However the 
president also made some concessions including guaranteeing Russian-
language rights and more regional autonomy. Russia also offered some 
concessions yesterday including allowing Ukrainian and international observers 
in its own border posts along the border with Ukraine. In Iraq, semi-
