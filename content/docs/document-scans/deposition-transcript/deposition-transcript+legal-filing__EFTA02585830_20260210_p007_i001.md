Zitnik'= first task at SetPoint was to recruit a lead scientist to set up a =linical trial. Many scientists in the United States 
and Europe were hesitant to =o it, he says, but eventually he hired Paul-Peter Tak, a well-regarded =mmunologist and 
rheumatologist based at the Academic Medical Center, the University of Amsterdam's teaching hospital. "He was a 
=orward-thinking person willing to try an unconventional approach like this," Zitnik says. Tak in turn =fired Frieda 
Koopman, who was working on her Ph.D. in rheumatology at A.M.C., to find potential patients in the Netherlands and 
elsewhere in Europe. 
The day after =n article about the planned trial appeared in a Dutch newspaper, Koopman's office got more than a 
thousand calls from =heumatoid-arthritis patients begging to participate. "We never saw that coming,"=Koopman says. 
"We thought we might get one or two patients to join, and wouldn't =hat be nice." Invasive surgery was involved, after 
all. Koopman's team =eturned almost every call and selected several subjects based on what medications they had =ried 
and the severity of the pain and swelling in their joints. Over the next two =ears, her team continued to enroll new 
patients. 
The subjects =n the trial each underwent a 45-minute operation. A neurosurgeon fixed an inchlong device shaped like a 
corkscrew to the vagus nerve on =he left side of the neck, and then embedded just below the collarbone a =ilver-dollar-
size "pulse generator" that contained a battery and =icroprocessor programmed to discharge mild shocks from two 
electrodes. A thin wire made of a =latinum alloy connected the two components beneath the skin. Once the implant was 
=urned on, its preprogrammed charge — about one milliamp; a small LED =onsumes 10 times more electricity — zapped 
the vagus nerve in 60-second bursts, =p to four times a day. Typically, a patient's throat felt constricted and tingly =or a 
moment. After a week or two, arthritic pain began to subside. Swollen joints shrank, and =food tests that checked for 
inflammatory markers usually showed striking =eclines. 
Koopman told =e about a 38-year-old trial patient named Mirela Mustacevic whose rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed 
when she was 22, and who had =ince

tried nine =ifferent medications, including two she had to self-inject. Some of them helped but had nasty side effects, 
like nausea and skin rashes. =efore getting the SetPoint implant in April 2013, she could barely grasp a pencil; now =he's 
riding her bicycle to the Dutch coast, a near-20-mile round trip from =er home. Mustacevic told me: "After the implant, I 
started to do things I =adn't done in years — like taking long walks or just putting clothes on in the =orning without help. 
I was ecstatic. When they told me about the surgery, I was a bit =orried, because what if something went wrong? I had 
to think about whether it =as worth it. But it was worth it. I got my life back."
