The physical world is no longer real. That rational, reasoned, objective world of classical science and humanistic thought is 
now positively mystical and occult. aceCombat all rationalist dogmas that stand in the way of a metaphysical univerself4 Man 
is dead. Metaphysical I instead. Not reality, but realization. Dismiss yourself. Let go: thereaTMs nothing lost. 
This is the age of unimportance. Reject world. Reject external reality: reject internal reality. Say no to yourself, to your great 
truths, to your great men, to your great books. 
Not revelations of belief, not the Capital Letters: Truth, God, Freedom, Justice, Will. . . but the precious portents of our own 
powers: the limits of my language mean the limits of my world. Finite man: he icemade a personal matter of what had before 
his time been treated in dogmatic form, dominated by tradition. He had no use for anything except evidence or observation 
scrupulously verified. What this amounted to was a refusal to attach to language any value derived merely from people or 
books . . his self tipped the balance.im
No more great men, no more great books: his self tipped the balance. His realization was the balance: is the balance. But in a 
finite world, even the self is denied, reduced to an object. No more great men, no more great books . . . no more importance. 
Deny your ficeown validity . . . Surrender to the flux, to the drift towards a new and unthinkable order.P2 iccUproot yourself. 
Uproot yourself, socially and vegetatively. Exile yourself from every earthly country.fio 
No: negation is the only way, there is no way. The universe must be created out of all, not created from nothing. Created by 
negation for creating or not creating changes nothing. Changes nothing because all created things are unreal: are nothing. 
Negation is the only way: no. 
Finite man: he says no to everything in order to get at himself. Yet heaTMs not alive, heaTMs not himself. He lives in his image: 
the unreal. 
What is: is other things. Man is dead. He lives in his image: the unreal. iceHow can anyone be what one is? No sooner does 
the question occur to us than it takes us out of ourselves, and at once we see how impossible we are. Immediately we are 
astonished at being someone, at the absurdity of every individual fact of existence, at the curious effect of seeing our acts 
beliefs and persons duplicated; everything human is too humani"an oddity, a delusion, a reflex, a nonsense. The system of 
conventions becomes comic, sinister, unbearable to think of, almost unbelievable! Laws, religion, customs, clothes, beliefs . . . 
all seem curiosities, a masqueradelis 
Metaphysical I: of whom I know nothing. I donet know who I am. There is no signifiable reality. No one truth, no essence. 
Rims slippery: therein% nothing left to bold on to. We are completely deprived. You are totally denied. And I: I donaTMt 
know who I am. acelt has not yet been our good fortune to establish with any degree of accuracy what I am, where I am, 
whether I am words among words, or silence in the midst of silence.a43
I: words among words or silence in the midst of silence. The final answer will be in the transcendence of all categories, of all 
names: the death of the word. But this caning be so: there is no transcendence: no answer. World is finite: there is no 
distinction between observation and its object. Not reality, but realization. Transcendence belongs to the real, infinite world:
