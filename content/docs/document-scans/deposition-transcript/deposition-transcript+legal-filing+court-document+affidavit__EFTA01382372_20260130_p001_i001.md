each other such that, with respect to U.S. federal income tax returns for any taxable period in which Blackhawk or any of its subsidiaries 
were included in Safeway's consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of taxes to be paid by Blackhawk was 
determined, subject to certain adjustments, as if Blackhawk and each of its subsidiaries included in such consolidated group filed their 
own consolidated federal income tax return. For state and local income tax purposes, the Prior TSA provided that Safeway and 
Blackhawk would generally make payments to each other such that, with respect to state and local income tax returns for any taxable 
period in which Blackhawk or any of its subsidiaries were included in Safeway's combined, consolidated or unitary group for state or local 
income tax purposes, the amount of taxes to be paid by Blackhawk was determined, subject to certain limitations, by calculating the 
excess of any taxes shown due on any such return over the amount that would otherwise be due if the return were recalculated by 
excluding Blackhawk and any of its included subsidiaries.
