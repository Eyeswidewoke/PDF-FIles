785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
Nucor contends that nowhere in the workers' opening brief is the Rule 23(b)(3) ruling 
addressed, and that any challenge to that decision has thus been waived. [HN281 The 
doctrine of waiver derives from the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which require 
that the argument section of an appellant's opening brief contain the "appellant's 
contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the 
record on which the appellant [**58] relies." Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A); see also Mayfield 
v. Nat'l Ass'n for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc., 674 F.3d 369, 376-77 (4th Cir. 2012). 
"Failure of a party in its opening brief to challenge an alternate ground for a district court's 
ruling . . . waives that challenge." United States ex rel. Ubl v. IIF Data Solutions, 650 F.3d 
445, 456 (4th Cir. 2011) (quoting Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1118 n.6 (9th Cir. 
2010))). 
The workers contend first, and we agree, that no waiver occurred because their arguments 
in the opening brief extended to the district court's discussion of both predominance and 
commonality. The single issue identified by the workers on appeal did not differentiate 
between the court's findings on either question. The issue, as presented, was this: 
Was it error or an abuse of discretion for the district court not to follow this Circuit's mandate holding that sufficient 
statistical and non-statistical evidence has been presented to certify a pattern-or-practice and disparate impact class 
covering all six production departments of the defendants' manufacturing plant in Huger, South Carolina? 
Consistent with that framing, the workers' opening brief describes the district court's 
decision in equally broad terms without distinguishing between commonality and 
predominance. See Appellants' Br. 28-29 ("The district court erred as a matter of law by 
declining to follow this Court's mandate that held there is sufficient statistical r59] and 
non-statistical evidence to certify a class covering all six production departments."); 
Appellants' Br. 3 (citing to the portion of the district court opinion where predominance is 
discussed). 
Although more explicit separation of the predominance and commonality inquiries would 
no doubt have been wise, the workers' arguments throughout their brief directly respond to 
the issues the district court raised in both contexts (issues that, as discussed below, were 
intertwined by the court). The workers, for instance, specifically cite cases discussing 
predominance when arguing about the extent to which a court may look to merits in 
deciding certification. See Appellants' Br. 34-35. Elsewhere, in discussing the sufficiency of 
the anecdotal evidence presented, the workers argued in favor of our holding in Brown I 
that "[t]his evidence alone establishes common claims of discrimination worthy of class 
certification." Appellants' Br. 42 (citing Brown I, 576 F.3d at 153). Certification of the 
workers' class required a finding that Rule 23(b) was satisfied, in addition to a finding of 
commonality under Rule 23(a)(2). More generally, without limiting its analysis to the 
question of commonality, the workers' opening brief observes [*919] that "[I]he district 
[**60] court's finding that there is no pattern-or-practice evidence in the non-Beam Mill 
departments is directly contrary to the evidence and [the Fourth Circuit's] mandate." 
Appellants' Br. 42-43. 
It is true that the workers arguments often focus expressly on the question of commonality, 
as Wal-Mart focused its analysis. In that regard, however, the workers have merely 
followed the district courts lead insofar as the court itself raised the same arguments 
under Rule 23(b)(3) as it did regarding commonality under Rule 23(a)(2).fl See J.A. 10958-
