Donald Trump, Attorney General Bondi has confirmed. AG Bondi, in a Monday night interview with Fox 
News host Sean Hannity, also said the Justice Department is looking at conducting investigations into the 
actions of Smith's team and also into the conduct of prosecutors and federal agents involved in the 
sprawling criminal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. "Well, first and foremost, we got 
rid of the Jack Smith team. Gone. Those people are gone," AG Bondi said. "We're still trying to find ... a lot 
of people in the FBI and also in the Department of Justice who despise Donald Trump, despise us, don't 
want to be there. You have to do the right thing and right now we're going to root them out," AG Bondi 
said. "We will find them, and they will no longer be employed." The article added that AG Bondi told 
Hannity she's been working with recently confirmed Director Patel to cull the staff of people determined 
to be problematic. "We're starting at every level of the Justice Department, Sean, and getting rid of the 
worst of the worst. But there are a lot more people that shouldn't be there." The article highlighted that 
AG Bondi's statements on the Fox interview indicated a stark shift from her tone earlier this year. During 
her Jan. 15 Senate confirmation hearing, Bondi denied that she would engage in a politically motivated 
purge of the Justice Department. "Politics will not play a pare Bondi, a former two-term Florida attorney 
general, told senators. "I've demonstrated that my entire career as a prosecutor, as attorney general and I 
will continue to do that." 
Continued Reporting: Top FBI Official in New York Forced Out After Resisting 
Trump Purge of Agents 
The Guardian (03/04, Lakhani) and the Washington Post (03/04, Staff Writer) reported that James 
Dennehy, the FBI's top official in New York, was forced out after resisting the Trump Administration's 
purge of agents who investigated the January 6 assault on the Capitol. According to the article, Dennehy's 
removal comes after the departure of eight veteran FBI officials involved in criminal investigations into 
Trump, and may lead to further layoffs of career officers. The article noted that Dennehy had vowed to 
"dig in" and resist the purge, and his departure has raised concerns about the influence of Trump and his 
allies in the justice system. "Today, we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own as good people 
are being walked out of the FBI," Dennehy wrote to staff last month. "And others are being targeted 
because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy." The article noted that in his 
farewell email on Monday, Dennehy urged FBI officials to maintain the agency's independence. "As I leave 
today, I have an immense feeling of pride — to have represented an office of professionals who will always 
do the right thing for the right reasons; who will always seek the truth while upholding the rule of law," 
he wrote. "Who will always handle cases and evidence with an overabundance of caution and care for the 
innocent, the victims, and the process first; and who will always remain independent". Additional

of evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, which has been delivered to FBI headquarters. "I have the 
FBI going through them," AG Bondi said, adding that Director Patel "is going to get us a detailed report as 
to why" the documents had been withheld. "We're going to go through it, go through it as fast as we can, 
but go through it very cautiously to protect all the victims of Epstein because there are a lot of victimsr 
she said. AG Bondi reiterated that a "team" assembled by Director Patel is going to look over the 
documents "as fast" as possible so "we can get it out to the American people, because the American
