I think you might try to plan on late september, ta=ing my apt and spending a 
few days with valeria in the city, A= it is the openiing of the UN general assembly , as well as the Clinton global 
initiative New york is rife with people with a= least influence, if not new ideas. . I, we. can organize man= fun 
interactions. my house becomes a respite for the select f=w, to take off their ties , and talk openly. You would be 
welcome to join as many create or participate as you prefer. =AO yangs work deals with language as signals . his 
relia=ce on Zipf like distributions is a good example of naive probablities. .=C2 empirically zipf appears. but cannot be 
derived from any of his or anyones elses to date. so somewhat misleading to suggest the&=uot; probililty of word , x 
appearing, " it is the =istake of frequency vs probablity, and careless common usage.=u>
