David Bowie was both a chameleon and shap=-shifter who pushed his music relentlessly forward while reinventing 
himself as many personas =E2$4 from Davie Jones, a young rhythm and blues singer from the London neighborh=od 
of Brixton, to the interplanetary pop star Ziggy Stardust and the dapper hedonist the Thin White Duke while laying bare 
his demons for his audience. He explored androgyny and otherworldliness, and sampled cultures from different 
contine=ts (and galaxies) as his musical and visual palettes continued to evolve, alwa=s theatrical and deeply layered 
until his focus turned to his own looming end. 
My favorite moment with Bowie was back in the late 1980s when with Quincy Jones, he and Phil Ramone joined us at 
Columbus Restaurant</=> on the Upper Westside of Manhattan where we drank and shared stories until almost 7am. 
He innocently asked me how had we not met and I responded that I had hung out with him and his wife at the time 
Angie in London a number of time= in the early 1970s but we were first introduced when he first came to my perso=al 
favorite haunts Max's Kansas City (the most famous watering hole for counter-culture in the late 1960s/early 70s in NYC) 
— and that I thought that his orange/reddish mane of hair, monkey fur collar purp=e jacket, skin-tight pants and six inch 
platform boots, coupled with his Engl=sh accent and aloof mannerisms, he was one of the weirdest people whom I had 
e=er met at the time. His response was to say that he was just playing a role and that real weird was Iggy Pop, who he 
ha= come to meet. By then he was no longer the pretender dealing with demons or the knucklehead in the 1970s and 
80s t=at most people have chosen to ignore, but a great guy who could be smart, =itty, fun, with a sense of 
introspection. 
=br> 
Still, I was actually surprised by the=out-pouring of sadness and affection by fans and friends around the world 
reminiscing and grappling wi=h his lost and the thought about what his music and his life meant to them.=C24> David 
Bowie was the Salvatore Dali of music. And like Dali, Bo=ie was a cultural icon for the bizarre and surreal with a genius 
for self-promotion combined with unquestionable talent. Bazaar and outlandish while at the same time quietly elegant, 
David Bowie inspired a generation of artists and non-artists to reach beyond the frame of the pain=ing in search of new 
realities and if not, make great music that people can dan=e to and images that are remembered.... With this, you are 
again =nvited to enjoy the music of rock icon in the Pantheon of Music, Mr. David Bowie....<=i>
