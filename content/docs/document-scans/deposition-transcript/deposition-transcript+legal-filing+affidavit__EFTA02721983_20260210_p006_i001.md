word, turning this into a "process" has helped ensure that peace is never obtained. It is more 
appropriately called the "Extortion Process" because all that results is that violence is used over 
decades to extract concessions from Israel. 
These three levels must be understood for their differences while united by a single goal. While 
these levels often op erate together and assist each other, we must avoid "level confusion" which 
the Control Factor employs to curtail our fears. If the Obama narrative is swallowed- that the only 
threat is the Violent Jihad- we will miss the other contamination fomenting within our 
borders. We must appreciate how these levels work together and even unite with other forces 
such as the global Leftist movement that you, Jamie, have described so forcefully in United in 
Hate. 
FP: You write about how we like to talk of "Good Muslims" and how we are always on the 
eternal search for "moderate" Muslims (Khatami, Mousavi, Abbas, etc), while we stress how the 
"extremists" are the real problem and how "few" they really are. All of this is connected to the 
Control F actor. Enlighten us. 
Siegel: The Control Factor seeks to have us feel in control of the situation. The easiest way to do 
this is to simply minimize the number of potential enemies. We have been lectured for years about 
how Islam is a "religion of peace" and that the violence we see (remember that we have already 
improperly limited the problem to violence) is the product of a small number of "crazies" 
(remember Hillary Clinton's 50,000) who have distorted Islam. I call this the "Peaceful Muslim 
Disclaimer" as virtually everyone in the press and government has been bullied into making some 
statement of the kind to silence those who will pressure them that they are "Islamophobic" and 
Islam is being attacked. (These are the Islam hustlers who operate on the same principles that 
black race hustlers so effectively used to extort concessions over the last six decades or so). 
Nobody has done any real work to support this proposition, nor is it clear exactly how it would be 
tested. My view is that the grammar "Islam is x" is itself problematic because Islam has expressed 
itself throughout history in a variety of fashions. It is more useful to talk in terms of how seriously 
engaged with Islam, the Koran and other texts, a Muslim is. What is significant is how Muslims 
today are using Islam and most of those who are in power either throughout a large territory or 
within a small community tend toward, if not fully advocate, the very supremacist ideas that we 
try to tell ourselves arc reserved for the few "extremists." Presumably most Germans did not 
wish to see all Nazi atrocities carried out but in the end they fell in line because they had to. Those 
our politicians and press call the "extremists" are in one sense more accurately the "good" 
Muslims who ar e following their Islamic beliefs dutifully. 
FP: Tell us how Western shame and guilt play into all of this. 
Siegel: One of the dirty little secrets the Control Factor preys upon is that if we believe we 
control something we can comfort ourselves that we can change it. Remember the horror film- the 
threat has one purpose and that is to destroy you. You can not change it, talk it out of it, teach it 
alternatives or otherwise. That is what makes it so inherently frightening. If we can convince 
ourselves that we caused the threat to act the way it does we can maintain the secret hope that we 
can change it. Consequently, there is a tremendous attraction to blaming ourselves for the Islamic 
Enemy's behavior. And we see this power in our readily accepting responsibility for terror-
