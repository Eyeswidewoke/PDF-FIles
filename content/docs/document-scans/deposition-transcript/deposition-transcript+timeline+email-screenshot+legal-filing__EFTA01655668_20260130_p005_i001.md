Zetas. According to the article, the FBI added Caro Quintero to its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives in 2018 because he 
allegedly resumed drug trafficking operations following his 2013 prison release, and he was further implicated in 
the killing of DEA agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena decades earlier. Several suspects were transported from Mexican 
prisons to the U.S. under an expulsion provision tied to national security, bypassing the standard extradition 
process, with the DOJ emphasizing that these are some of the most significant cartel figures captured in recent 
history. 
Border Patrol, FBI Leaders Who First Identified Tren de Aragua Recount Gang's Rise to Power 
Fox News (03/03, Taylor) reported that the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) was first identified in El 
Paso by Border Patrol and FBI leaders, who sounded alarms about the gang's rise to power. According to the article, 
the gang is involved in various criminal activities, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, extortion, and 
modern slavery, and is considered a national security threat. The article explained that it took years for the public 
to become aware of TdA, but the Trump administration has now prioritized taking down the gang, with FBI and 
Border Patrol agents finally feeling heard and enabled to do their jobs to the fullest extent, according to leaders like 
Walter Slosar, Tim Sullivan, Britton Boyd, and John Morales. "Tren de Aragua has a whole different network of how 
they work, how they extort, and how they exploit the people that are around them," El Paso FBI Special Agent in 
Charge Morales said. "There are similarities and people may conflate one with the other, but they're a completely 
different animal." 
ICE, FBI Arrest International Gang Leader With Terrorist Affiliation Living In Maryland 
Daily Voice (03/03, Failla) reported that David Alejandro Orellana-Aleman, a 27-year-old high-ranking MS-13 leader, 
was arrested in Hyattsville, Maryland, in a joint operation between ICE and the FBI. According to the 
article, Orellana-Aleman was wanted in El Salvador for crimes including firearm possession, extortion, and terrorist 
affiliation, and controlled MS-13 operations in the US, Mexico, and Europe. The article noted that he remains in ICE 
custody after his arrest, which authorities say has made Maryland safer and dealt a significant blow to the MS-13 
organization. "Maryland is immediately safer because of this arrest," added FBI Baltimore Special Agent in Charge 
William J. DelBagno. "Working together, we took custody of one of the highest-ranking gang members in the United 
States." 
Senate Democrats Warn of 'Brain Drain' in DOJ Immigration Focus 
Bloomberg (03/03, Monyak) reported that Senate Democrats raised concerns to Attorney General Pam Bondi that 
the Justice Department's effort to prioritize immigration enforcement will disrupt other prosecutions and threaten 
security. Reassignments and firings of career leaders with national security expertise at the DOJ and FBI "have 
diminished the country's ability to respond to national security or public safety threats," Senate Judiciary 
Committee Democrats wrote in a Monday letter. "The sweeping changes to personnel assignments and resource 
allocation across Dal will lead to widespread disruption and delay in prosecutions, investigations, and sensitive 
operations," the letter said. According to the article, the senators' letter comes as the Trump administration 
has moved to focus enforcement efforts away from traditional priorities, like white collar crime. Department 
leaders have signaled plans to reassign prosecutors to border districts. "Personnel at DOJ, the FBI, and other 
component agencies are now limited in their ability to combat threats to public safety and national security, and a 
dedicated and talented workforce is facing a crisis of morale," the letter said. 
Editorial: America Must Confront Domestic Terrorism 
Penn Live (03/03, Pittman) reported that domestic terrorism in the United States remains inconsistently classified. 
According to the article, the FBI's 2020 updated definition of domestic terrorism emphasizes both the act and the 
intent: it must involve violence dangerous to human life and appear intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian 
population, influence government policy, or affect government conduct through mass destruction, assassination, or 
kidnapping, yet this definition is unevenly applied. The article explained that several 2022 incidents—including the 
mass shooting at Club Q, a Colorado Springs club serving the LGBTQ+ community, and a shooting at a Taiwanese 
church in Southern California—met the FBI's criteria based on motives like racial, ethnic, or political hatred, though 
neither incident was officially charged as domestic terrorism. The article noted that the 2024 New Year's attacks, 
such as the incident in New Orleans where a pickup truck bearing an ISIS flag caused 14 fatalities, followed by a 
Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas, underscore the ongoing challenges and hesitancy in uniformly applying 
domestic terrorism labels. Initially, the FBI was hesitant to classify the attack as domestic terrorism due to the lack 
of an apparent motive. This hesitation drew significant criticism because of the act's extreme violence. The author 
assessed that to bolster national security and public trust, the U.S. must adopt a more rigorous and consistent
