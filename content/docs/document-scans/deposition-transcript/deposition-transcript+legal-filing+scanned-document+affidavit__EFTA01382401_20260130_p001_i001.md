Conflicts of Interest 
A portion of the net proceeds from this offering will be used to repay borrowings outstanding under the ABS/Safeway Term Loan 
Facilities. Because one or more funds or accounts managed or advised by an investment management affiliate of Guggenheim 
Securities, LLC are lenders under the ABS/Safeway Term Loan Facilities and may receive 5% or more of the net proceeds from this 
offering, Guggenheim Securities, LLC is deemed to have a "conflict of interest" within the meaning of Rule 5121. As such, this offering is 
being conducted in accordance with the applicable requirements of Rule 5121. Rule 5121 requires that a "qualified independent 
underwriter" meeting certain standards participate in the preparation of the registration statement and prospectus and exercise the usual

meaning of Rule 5121 in connection with this offering. Goldman, Sachs & Co. will not receive any additional fees for serving as a 
qualified independent underwriter in this offering. We have agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to indemnify Goldman, Sachs 
& Co. against certain liability incurred in connection with it acting as a qualified independent underwriter in this offering, including 
liabilities under the Securities Act. Guggenheim Securities, LLC will not confirm sales to accounts in which it exercises discretionary
