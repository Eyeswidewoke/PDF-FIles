short period that the air strikes have taken place, =hey've predictably generated the usual reports of "collateral 
=amage," including 17 civilians in Talbiseh at the very outset on =eptember 30. 
=p class="MsoNormal">The Russian moves, if only because they=represent something fundamentally different in a 
conflict that has ground =n for more than four years, have attracted enormous media attention. =Putin's audacity has 
even garnered something approximating grudging re=pect from across the political spectrum. His speech at the UN last 
m=nth, which heralded the more muscular Russian policy, qualified him as the="new sheriff in town" and his country as 
the "rea= powerbroker in the Middle East," according to conservative natio=al security analyst John Schindler. 
Economist contributor Edward Luc=s termed Putin's speech a "triumph" while his decisiv= intervention in Syria, in 
comparison to the blunders of the West, make th= Russian leader seem "a responsible statesman, to whom we turn in 
=esperation for help." Juan Cole, after dismissing the Obama admin=stration efforts as ineffectual, concludes that "Putin 
knows what =e wants and has an idea about how to achieve it." 
Even for some on the left, Putin continues to represent a praisewort=y counterforce to American power and the kind of 
iron-fist response to the=lslamic State that some crave. "Putin is not going to stop f=r anything or anyone," writes Mike 
Whitney at Counterpunch. 40=AO"He's going to nail these guys while he has them in his gun-=ights, then he's going to 
wrap it up and go home. By the time the Obam= crew gets its act together and realizes that they have to stop the 
bombin= pronto or their whole regime change operation is going to go up in smoke,=Putin's going to be blowing kisses 
from atop a float ambling through R=d Square in Moscow's first tickertape parade since the end of WW2.=quot; 
It's safe to say that most military interv=ntions look decisive at the beginning. That's when pundits and policym=kers talk 
of "cakewalks" and "troops home by Chri=tmas." But there's really no reason to believe that Rus=ia's military 
intervention in Syria will produce results appreciably d=fferent from what the United States and its allies have already 
(notquagmire" in Syria (though, of course, the president hasn&=39;t publicly acknowledged the quasi-quagmire into 
which he himself has ti=toed). 
It's impossible to know what Putin hopes =o achieve from this gambit other than to guarantee Russian involvement in 
=hatever happens next. Perhaps all sides will throw up their hands an= take refuge at the negotiating table, with Putin 
emerging, as he did afte= the chemical weapons compromise in September 2013, as the master diplomat= Or perhaps 
the war will continue to grind on, but with more firepow=r added to the equation and thus more casualties, more 
extremist reactions= and more desperate refugees, with Putin playing the role of master spoile= who wants to pin the 
West down in an intractable conflict. In eithe= case, Putin would earn his title as grandmaster of geopolitics. 
=span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:17.1200008392334px;font-family:Ge=rgia,serif">l suspect, however, that 
Vladimir Putin is just as foolish and=trigger-happy as any world leader with a large expeditionary force and the=itch to 
use it. Attempting to save Bashar al-Assad in Syria is tantamount =o trying to prop up Nguyen Van Thieu in South 
Vietnam in the 1960s. =he Russian government will claim success for its air war -- just as the Un=ted States and allies do
