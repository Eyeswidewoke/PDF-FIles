6. 
liability 
A. Liability for Unauthorized Use. 
i. 
Call us AT ONCE at 1 866-362-4796 if you believe that someone has transferred or may transfer money from 
your Account without your permission or if you believe your Private Wealth ID, User ID or Password has been 
compromised. You can notify the Bank by telephone at the number above, or by calling your Private Banker 
or in writing at the following address: Deutsche Bank Trust Company of Americas, Branch Operations, 
345 Park Avenue, MS NYC20-0102, New York, NY 10154. Telephoning immediately is the best way of 
keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your Account(s). 
ii. 
For consumers: If you notify us within two Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Private 
Wealth ID, User ID or Password, you can lose no more than $50.00 if someone used your Private Wealth ID, 
User ID or Password without your permission or otherwise made an unauthorized electronic funds transfer 
from your Account. If you do not tell us within two Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your 
Private Wealth ID, User ID or Password and we can show that, had you told the Bank, it could have stopped 
someone from using the Private Wealth ID, User ID or Password without your permission or making other 
unauthorized electronic transfers from your Account you could lose as much as $500.00. 
iii. For consumers: If your statement shows transfers that you did not make, tell us at once. You must notify the 
Bank within sixty (60) days after the statement was made available to you. You may not get back the money 
lost due to unauthorized transfers after those sixty (60) days if the Bank can show that your providing notice 
within those sixty (60) days could have prevented the loss. If a good reason (such as a long trip or hospital 
stay) kept you from telling the Bank, we will extend the time periods. 
iv. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement. we will not be liable or have any responsibility of any kind for 
any loss or damage incurred by you as a result, directly or indirectly, of any unauthorized person gaining 
access to, or otherwise making use of. the Internet Banking Services. 
v. 
With your agreement we may use a Security Code as a security procedure to prevent unauthorized funds 
transfers or other payments (requests for funds transfers, ACH entries, transfers between accounts, bill 
payment, other payment orders or other communications will be referred to as "Payment Orders" and each of 
which as a "Payment Order"). You acknowledge that you have been offered alternative security procedures 
and have chosen the Internet Banking Services and these procedures after consideration of the risks of loss 
faced by you due to the possibility of an unauthorized transaction occurring. We may process any Payment 
Order we receive in your name and you will be responsible for it if it was initiated using one of your Security 
Codes. If a Payment Order issued to us in your name as sender is verified as authentic using the security 
codes the Payment Order will be effective as your Payment Order whether or not authorized. This means that 
you will be deemed to have given the Payment Order, and you will be obligated on it (including to pay us the 
amount), even if it was not authorized by you. Each time you send a Payment Order through the Internet 
Banking Services, you warrant that the Security Code is a commercially reasonable method to detect an 
unauthorized transaction, based on the circumstances involved (e.g., the size, type, and frequency of your 
transfers, as well as your intemal controls). If at any time the Security Code ceases to be a commercially 
reasonable method to detect unauthorized transactions (such as by a change in your usage pattems or other 
circumstances), you agree to inform us immediately. 
vi. Except as described and set forth in this Agreement, you agree that you are responsible for and bound by any 
Payment Order that is received by us in your name if it was authorized by you, whether or not we used the 
security procedures to verify authenticity or could have prevented a loss to you by using the security 
procedures to verify the authenticity of the Payment Order. You agree that we will not be responsible for 
verifying whether a Payment Order or other communication is originated by an authorized person other than 
through the verification process contained in these security procedures. Thus, when an employee is added or 
deleted as an authorized person on the system, the Bank will treat that person as "authorized' if the security 
procedures are followed, without verifying that employee with you or otherwise investigating whether the 
employee is exercising authority granted by you or consistent with any internal limitations on activity 
established by you for that employee. Among other things, this means that you will be solely liable for any 
losses or damages resulting from your breach of this Agreement or to which your negligence contributed, or 
which resulted from unauthorized, fraudulent or dishonest acts by your current and/or former authorized 
agents (including instances where an authorized agent acted to your detriment). 
vii. You are responsible for controlling access to the Internet Banking Services and for any limitations placed by 
you on the Internet Banking Services that an authorized person may utilize. The fact that we are, or may be 
aware of, or could have discovered, any limitation on access to an Intemet Banking Service does not make us 
obligated to enforce or attempt to enforce any limitation. You understand that each authorized person may 
utilize the Internet Banking Services without regard to any restrictions otherwise applicable to an Account. 
B. Limitation on Liability 
i. 
For consumers: If we do not complete an electronic funds transfer (as defined in the Electronic Funds 
Transfer Act and Regulation E of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) to or from your Account on time 
or in the correct amount according to your instructions given in accordance with this Agreement, we will be 
liable for losses or damages proximately caused by us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not be liable for 
losses or damages that are caused by an event described in Section 6(B)(ii).
