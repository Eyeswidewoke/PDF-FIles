This is somewhat catastrophic but It's a decent read (at least it was for me)

> Hindsight is a wonderful thing, especially when it comes to explaining market crashes. Six times in the 
past 50 years US equities dropped more than 30 per cent in 12 months. After most of them investors 
looked back at glaring warning signs and were baffled that they missed them. If the S&P 500 were to 
plunge from 2,000 to 1,400 in the next year, what screaming sell signals would future generations gaze at 
in the history books and wonder at our ability to ignore the obvious? 
> * Leveraged loans to private equity are not just flashing red but have a wailing siren and a man walking 
in front waving a flag. The loans are even bothering the see-no-evil officials at the Federal Reserve, who 
have been trying to persuade banks that excessively leveraged loans are risky. 
> More than a third of leveraged loans this year have lent more than six times earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation, only slightly below the proportion at the peak of the 2007 credit 
bubble, according to S&P Capital IQ. 
> Bank exuberance is shown by loans with less lender protection than usual. The proportion of "covenant 
light", or cov-lite, loans is above 60 per cent, the highest ever. If and when things go wrong, it will be 
harder for lenders to demand their money back. 
> * Junk bonds may be known as high yield but offer an extraordinarily low yield. The benchmark Merrill 
Lynch index yields 6.3 per cent, lower than any time before April - although after a summer wobble it is 
up from the record low of 5.7 per cent in June. 
> The spread over government bonds, reflecting the extra reward for the risk of lending money to the 
companies with the lowest credit ratings, is still below 4 percentage points, too. This is not at all-time 
lows, but a rise in the default rate from its near-record low below 2 per cent towards the average since 
1993 of 4.5 per cent would be disastrous for investors. 
> Buyers of junk bonds are loosening the purse strings in a similar way to those in leveraged loans. Last 
year was the best for risky payment-in-kind bonds (where interest can be rolled up) since 2008, although 
they make up a smaller proportion of what is now a far larger junk market. 
> • A boom in flotations is running at a pace not seen since the dotcom bubble burst. Companies are 
rushing to raise money, and the quality of the protections being offered to shareholders has declined 
markedly in the hottest sectors of biotechnology and dotcoms. Friday's Alibaba offering, the biggest-ever 
US IPO, has experienced phenomenal demand for shares that give investors zero say in how the 
company is run or who it is run by. Shareholders will not even own some of the vital operating assets. 
> Typically companies choose to sell themselves when investors are overexcited. When a sector is in 
great demand, entrepreneurs find ways to create supply: more and more companies are created from 
scratch or carved out of existing businesses until prices tumble. The longer this goes on, the lower the 
quality of the new companies. Only with hindsight will we know if this has gone on too long. 
> * Alongside the IPO boom, a wave of takeovers looks similar to 2000 and 2007. Takeovers are largely 
financed by debt, as companies see bonds as even more overpriced than equity, and so easy to sell. 
> * As companies gear up to buy shares in rivals, they are also borrowing to buy shares in themselves. 
Both takeovers and buybacks reduce the share count, pushing up prices and making earnings per share 
grow faster at the expense of the balance sheet. 
> Overall, Societe Generale points out that companies are borrowing more than at the 2007 peak and 
buying back about the same, although cash flows are a little stronger now (perhaps because super-low 
rates are keeping down borrowing costs).
