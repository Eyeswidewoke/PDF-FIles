Rewards Plus Gold Card 
Membership Rewards® 
Program Point Accrual 
Change 
Rewards Plus Gold Card ("RPG") Membership Rewards® ("MR") 
Program Point Accrual Change 
MR Terms and Conditions ("T&Cs") are changing effective January 1, 2006 to 
provide that Corporate Cards ("CCs") linked to an MR account with an RPG Card 
will no longer earn 2 MR points during the first year of RPG Cardmembership and 
1.5 MR points during each succeeding year of membership for every dollar 
charged on such linked CCs with any airline or hotel having a Frequent Customer 
program participating in MR. Consumer Cards and small business Cards linked to 
the RPG Card will continue to be awarded the bonus. 
Accordingly, the last sentence of paragraph 1 of the Point Accrual section of the 
T&Cs is changing to include "consumer and Business" between "Linked" and 
"Accounts'. 
Membership Rewards® 
Plus program ("MR") Fee 
Change 
MR Terms and Conditions ("T&Cs") are changing effective 12/1/2005 to charge an 
annual fee of $150 to enroll a Corporate Card ("CC") in MR, even if it is linked to an 
MR account with enrolled charge cards other than a Centurion Card. This change 
applies to CCs enrolled in MR before that date on the next anniversary of such 
CC's enrollment date that occurs on or after that date. 
Accordingly: 
Sentence 3, paragraph 1 of the Annual Fees section of the T&Cs is changing to 
read: "The annual fee to enroll a Corporate Card is $150 unless the Corporate Card 
is linked to a Plus program account with a Centurion Card." 
The words "$35 annual fee for each Corporate Card and an additional" are being 
deleted from sentence 4, paragraph 1.
