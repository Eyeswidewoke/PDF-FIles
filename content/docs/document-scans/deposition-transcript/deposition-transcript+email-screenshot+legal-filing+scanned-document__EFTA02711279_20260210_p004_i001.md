of an entity only by decreating that entity. Invention by decreation. 
Concepts are the impersonal effect of an epoch. Names are included in conceptual exercises either to impress the reader or to 
support a notion so weak as to require a name with which to tyrannize the reader. aceThe first idea was not our own.104 Not 
one idea in this exercise is original. They are the ideas of the reader, not the author. There is no author. Not one idea in this 
exercise is original. 
The final elegance: assuming, asking the question. No answers. No explanations. accWhy do you demand explanations? If 
they are given, you will once more be facing a terminus. They cannot get you any further than you are at present.a45 The 
solution: not an explanation: a description and knowing how to consider it. 
Everything has been explained. There is nothing left to consider. The explanation can no longer be treated as a definition. The 
question: a description. The answer: not explanation, but a description and knowing how to consider it. Asking or telling: 
there isnatMt any difference. 
ficeWhy is a contradiction more to be feared than a tautologyr Success in this exercise is confusion. Knowledge is 
tautological. ficeKnowledge is the thing you know and how can you know more than you do Icnowr The decreation of 
reality: as it is known; as it is not known. The decreation of reality: the invention of reality. 
Make or do: You canairmt do other than do. Each observation destroys the bit of the universe observed, and thus supplies 
knowledge only of a universe which has already become past history. Make-create: spurious conceptions of the empirical 
notion of antecedent observation. Make-create: accretive advance from nothing to made; from nothing to created; from 
nothing to thing. Make-create: a real world taking a holiday. You canaTMt do other than do. Doing: do. Not doing: do. Make-
create: do. Not making-not creating: do. Observation and perturbation inevitably go together and the world around us is in 
perpetual flux, because we observe it. You canalMt do other than do. 
Nothing comes before performance. 
ficeConcepts which refer to distinctions beyond possible experience have no physical meaning and ought to be eliminated. 
This principle should be applied to the idea of physical continuity.a" No nature at an instant. aceAn infinitely small distance 
cannot be measured . . . we should especially emphasize the impossibility of physically defining a continuum in space and 
Sell° No accretion. It is impossible to locate a thing, stuff, etc., in space at an instant of time. No pictures. Experiments, 
measurements are what count. These keevents must be treated as the fimdamental objective constituentsa50 . . . an aceanalysis 
in terms of doings or happenings.a" No nature at an instant. ficeNature is such that it is impossible to determine absolute 
motion by any experiment whatsoever.V2 No nature at an instant: no movement; no change; no distance; no speed; no 
development; no continuity; no creation; no from; no direction; no there; no before; no accretion. 
No nature at an instant. But ficewhat can be described can also happens": the description is the thing. ficeWhere was it one
