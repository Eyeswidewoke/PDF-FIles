you or the organization you represent, as applicable, is not or ceases to be a Qualified Investor, to 
inform Skis Capital, to return or destroy any printed materials or other Confidential Information 
you have received. 
8. 
You acknowledge that certain materials included in the Confidential Information 
may have been prepared by third parties (such materials, "Third-Parry Materials"), and 
acknowledge that while such Third-Party Materials have been obtained from sources believed to 
be reliable and current, their accuracy cannot be guaranteed and in certain cases, the Information 
contained therein has not been updated through the date hereof. You understand and agree that 
neither Siris Capital nor the Fund makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to 
the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in the Third-Party Materials, and 
nothing contained therein should be relied upon as a promise or representation as to past or future 
performance of the Fund or other private funds sponsored or managed by Siris Capital (such 
private funds, together with the Fund, the "Sires Funds") or any other entity. To the extent that 
such Third-Party Materials contain references to the historical performance of Siris Capital, you 
agree to consider the information therein only in the broader context of the information prepared 
by Siris Capital. 
9. 
You understand that the Confidential Information does not constitute an offer to 
sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy an interest in any security or other investment with Skis 
Capital, and no such interest will be offered or sold to any person in any jurisdiction in which such 
offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities law of such jurisdiction. 
You understand that it is your obligation to familiarize yourself with the applicable securities laws 
of my jurisdiction. 
10.

that any other investment or Siris Funds will generate comparable returns. You understand and 
agree that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, and that a broad range 
of risk factors could cause the Fund to fail to meet its investment objectives. You understand that 
any investment with Siris Capital may yield results that are significantly different from that shown 
in the Confidential Information and that proceeding with a potential investment with Skis Capital 
may result in the loss of some or all of your invested capital. You understand and agree that prior 
to making a commitment to the Fund, you will carefully review the Confidential Information and, 
when available, any definitive documents relating to the Fund, including the "Risk Factors" section 
of the relevant private placement memorandum. 
11. 
You acknowledge that you will review Appendix A hereof titled "Legal 
Disclaimers and Other Important Information" prior to reviewing any Confidential Information 
provided to you and agree that you shall treat all Confidential Information as if all of the provisions 
of such Legal Disclaimers and Other Important Information were incorporated directly into each 
such document.
