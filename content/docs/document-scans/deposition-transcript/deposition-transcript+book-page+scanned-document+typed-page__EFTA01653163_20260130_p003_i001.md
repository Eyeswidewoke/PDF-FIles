was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate 
a US citizen." Bruce added that 'he most anticipated witness 
of the week is Gordon Sondland, the Trump mega-donor 
turned US Ambassador to the EU. Sondland has already 
revised his testimony once, admitting he personally told the 
Ukrainians that if they wanted nearly $400 million of military 
aid, they would have to publicly commit to investigate the 
Bidens." Bruce added that democrats announced Monday 
that David Holmes, who "testified he overheard one of their 
phone calls in a restaurant in Kiev," will "testify in public on 
Thursday."

Biesecker) reports that State Department officials were 
informed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky "was 
feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate

call that has led to impeachment hearings in Washington." 
According to the AP, in May, "officials at the U.S. Embassy in 
Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch," were 
told Zelensky Vas seeking advice on how to navigate the 
difficult position he was in," and Vas concerned' Trump and

the 2020 U.S. presidential race."

Sondland Call To Testify Tuesday. The CBS Evening 
News (11/18, story 2, 2:30, O'Donnell, 4.62M) reported, 
"Democrats added a new witness to the impeachment inquiry 
late today: the embassy staffer who says he overheard the 
President on the phone asking about investigations into the 
Bidens. David Holmes will be the ninth witness in a rapid-fire 
round of hearings that kick off tomorrow." The AP (11/18) 
reports Holmes "overheard Trump talking about the 
investigations on a phone call" with US Ambassador to the 
EU Gordon Sondland. The Washington Post (11/18, 
Zapotosky, Demirjian, Nakashima, Viebeck, 14.2M) reports 
Holmes 'told lawmakers last week that he was shocked to 
overhear" the call in which Sondland "assured President 
Trump that Ukrainian officials would pursue an investigation 
of interest to the U.S. commander in chief — a probe which 
the diplomat later suggested was of former Vice President 
Joe Biden. Holmes "also testified that the Ukrainians 
'gradually came to understand that they were being asked to 
do something in exchange' for a White House meeting or 
military aid." 
Vindman To Appear Before Impeachment Panel 
Tuesday. 
The Washington Post (11/18, Hamburger, 
Leonnig, Bade, 14.2M) reports, "The House impeachment 
hearing Tuesday is set to feature one of the Democrats' star 
witnesses: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Purple Heart 
recipient who is expected to testify about his alarm at 
President Trump's request that Ukraine investigate his 
political opponents." Republicans "are also seizing on 
Vindman's testimony as an opportunity, signaling that they 
plan to try to discredit one of the key witnesses in the inquiry 
by questioning his motives and his loyalty to the president." 
The Post says the "high-stakes appearance could provide 
some of the most contentious moments in the public 
hearings."

Fire Impeachment Witnesses. Anderson Cooper said on

witnesses who have testified against him in the impeachment 
hearings, prompting his aides to consider moving those

their home departments within the government." 
McConnell Predicts Impeachment Trial Will Carry 
Into 2020. Politico (11/18, Everett, 4.29M) reports Senate 
Majority Leader McConnell said Sunday that the House will 
likely be considering impeachment until Christmas, which will 
push a trial in the Senate into 2020. McConnell told reporters 
in Louisville, "It looks to me like the House is going to be on 
this until Christmas, then it comes over to the Senate. It 
displaces all other business. ... I don't know how long 
senators will want to continue the trial, but I'm pretty confident 
that in the end impeachment will not lead to ouster." Politico 
says that timeline means the trial "is almost certain to conflict 
with the efforts of a half-dozen Democratic senators to win 
the party's nomination for president." 
How House Staffers Learned US Aid To Ukraine 
Was Frozen And What They Did Next. NBC News (11/18, 
6.14M) reports on the events that led to the discovery that 
financial assistance to Ukraine had been frozen and actions 
taken to get the money released. Two days after "a 
whistleblower secretly filed a complaint about President

congressional staffers arrived in Kyiv on a routine business 
trip that ended up setting off alarm bells on Capitol Hill.' The 
aides "work for the Democratic leadership of the House 
Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for federal 
spending.' They had been "dispatched to make an on-the-
ground assessment of the cash Congress has been pumping 
into former Soviet states — including Moldova, Georgia and 
Ukraine — to aid their defenses against Russian aggression." 
But after traveling from Chisinau, the staffers 'were shocked 
to learn from US embassy officials that there was no new 
money coming into Ukraine." 
Witnesses Offer First-Hand Accounts Of 
Trump-Zelensky Call. According to the AP (11/19), 
"Republicans have consistently criticized 
the House 
impeachment inquiry by saying witnesses didn't have 
firsthand knowledge of" President Trump's "role in trying to 
persuade Ukraine to investigate a chief political rival." 
However, the AP says that after today's public hearing, -that 
posture is suddenly more difficult to maintain" because "the
