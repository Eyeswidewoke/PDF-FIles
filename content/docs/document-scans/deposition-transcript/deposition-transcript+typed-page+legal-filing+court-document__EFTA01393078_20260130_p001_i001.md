Important: Please read this appendix (continued) 
10. Notices. Notices and other communications may also be provided to Client verbally. Such notices and other 
communications left for Client on Client's answering machine, voice mail, electronic mail or otherwise, are considered 
to have been delivered to Client whether actually received or not. Transactions entered into Client's Account shall be 
confirmed by DBSI in writing where required by law or regulation. DBSI will not send separate confirmations for the 
following transactions: (a) dividends or distributions credited or reinvested, or transactions effected pursuant to a 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan, (b) shares of money market funds that are purchased or redeemed, or are part of the Cash 
Sweep Options, or (c) transactions effected pursuant to a periodic plan or an investment company plan. Clients periodic 
account statements will reflect these transactions. Notices concerning all matters related to Account(s) usually will go 
through DBSI although Pershing may send notice(s) directly to Client with a duplicate to DBSI should market conditions, 
time constraints or other circumstances so require. 
11. Conflicts of Interest. Seivices and recommendations that DBSI provides to Client may differ from the services and 
recommendations provided to other Clients or by other individuals or groups at DBSI and/or affiliates of Deutsche Bank AG, 
whether acting as principal or agent. DBSI provides investment advice, portfolio management and execution services for many 
Clients and, in addition, acts as principal in various markets. Given these different roles, individuals and groups at DBSI and 
affiliates of Deutsche Bank AG are seldom of one view as to an investment strategy and may pursue differing or conflicting 
strategies. Employees of DBSI shall have no obligation to recommend to Client, or inform Client of, strategies being pursued 
by DBSI or other Clients. Further, (a) DBSI end its affiliates may provide services for a fee to or solicit business from companies 
whose securities are recommended by DBSI, (b) DBS€ and its affiliates may be paid fees by investment companies registered 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other investment vehicles, including, without limitation, fees for acting as 
investment advisor, administrator, custodian and transfer agent, which fees may increase when DBSI clients invest in such 
investment vehicles, giving DBSI a financial incentive to recommend such investment vehicles to Client, and (c) DBSI and its 
affiliates act as brokers, principals andlor market makers in certain markets and may do so in transactions with Client. DBSI 
may recommend securities or strategies that are issued, underwritten, implemented or advised by DBSI or one or more of its 
affiliates. DBSI may receive compensation, in addition to the compensation Client pays DBSI, in the form of Rule 126-1 fees, 
distribution fees finder's fees, fees based upon fund management fees and cash or non-cash payments that are paid by mutual 
funds (out of fund assets in the case of Rule 12b-1 fees) or by the managers and other service providers to the funds (not out 
of fund assets), all or some of which tees or payments are ultimately borne by investors in the funds. DBSI also participates 
in a program offered by Pershing, under which DBSI shares in revenue received by Pershing from mutual funds offered on 
the Pershing platform. A mutual fund may offer several "classes" of shares, with each "class" charging different fees and 
costs. Please review the mutual fund's prospectus for a detailed description of the funds fees and expenses. In addition, the 
compensation payments made to DBSI as described above may vaty depending on the mutual fund share "class" held in a 
Client's account, which presents a conflict of interest because DBSI has a financial incentive to recommend a share class that 
pays relatively higher compensation to DBSI instead of a share class that pays relatively lower compensation to DBSI. All of 
these compensation payments may also vary based on sales volume or a mutual fund's assets under management. In addition, 
DBSI may receive trail compensation in connection with sales of auction rate securities. Finally, when considering and making 
recommendations of privately offered pooled investment vehicles (such as hedge funds, private equity funds or real estate 
funds) to you, we will consider and recommend only those vehicles that agree to pay to us fees (or "retrocessions) that are 
based on the amount you and other clients invest in those vehicles. In all cases we will disclose to you prior to your investment in 
a privately offered pooled investment vehicle the terms of our compensation arrangements with that vehicle. 
12. Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). DBSI provides SIPC coverage through Pershing and/or as a 
member of SIPC. For additional information on this coverage see www.SlPC.org or cal€ the SI PC public information 
number (202) 371.8300. Client will refer to the Annual Disclosure Statement, at http://deutschewealth.com/americas/en/ 
annualdisclosurestatement.html for additional information regarding SIPC and excess of SIPC coverage. 
13. Tax-Exempt Entities. Charitable remainder trusts, foundations, pension plans and other tax-exempt entities may be deemed to 
receive unrelated business taxable income (LIST!) as a result of investing in certain securities, borrowing monies under a margin 
loan, investing in a partnership or limited liability company that generates UBTI or other leverage or loan arrangements. 
Tax-exempt entities should consult with their tax adviser before making an investment or entering into such arrangement. 
14. Lost Securities. If Client's periodic Account Statement indicates that any Securities were forwarded to Client and Client has 
not received them, Client should notify DBSI immediately. If notification is received within 120 days after the mailing date, as 
reflected on Client's Account Statement, replacement will be made free of charge. Thereafter, a fee for replacement may apply. 
15. Note to Holders of Bank Bonds, Receivables from Credit Institutions and Bank Shares. Shares, bank issued securities (including 
interest bearing bank bonds and certificates) as well as other receivables from credit institutions are subject to specific legal 
provisions. These provisions can negatively affect investors and contracting parties of a credit institution in the event of a 
resolution of a credit institution. For further details please refer to litips:thwirw.db.00micompanyientinfor motion-on-bank-
