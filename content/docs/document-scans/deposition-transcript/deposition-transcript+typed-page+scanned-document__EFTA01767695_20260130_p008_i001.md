ideological experts who are balanced out by Brotherhood-affiliated deputy ministers. "We have more than one 
[Brotherhood] candidate for each cabinet position, and some of those might be deputies," Brotherhood parliamentary 
leader Saad al-Husseini told me. "And we might nominate someone from a technocratic [background] or ask the other 
parties for nominations." 
The Brotherhood's promise to nominate a Christian and female vice president is also more about symbolism 
than genuine power sharing. Brotherhood sources have suggested that Morsi may appoint up to five vice presidents, 
thereby watering down the influence of the Christian and female deputies. Moreover, to prevent Morsi from being 
succeeded by either a woman or a Copt in the event of his death, the Brotherhood will seek to maintain the current 
constitutional clause mandating that the speaker of the parliament -- currently Brotherhood leader Saad al-Katatny --
assume the presidency. "A state with a Muslim majority can't be ruled by a non-Muslim," Brotherhood Guidance Office 
leader Mahmoud Hussein told me, citing a sharia principle. The second prong of the Brotherhood's strategy for 
temporary calm involves its coordination with the military. "This relationship was established from the first day," Deeb, 
the Brotherhood parliamentarian, told me. "No clash, no total agreement." In the week leading up to the announcement 
of Morsi's victory, Brotherhood leaders Katatny and Khairat al-Shater, among others, met frequently with SCAF generals, 
apparently hashing out a deal to ensure Morsi's election while tabling other areas of disagreement. The existence of 
these meetings, which now include Morsi, have led to a shift in the Brotherhood's rhetoric. After months of accusing the 
SCAF of seeking to engineer the presidential elections and stage a coup, Brotherhood leaders are now praising the 
SCAF's stewardship. At an inaugural event on Saturday, Morsi declared, "The SCAF has fulfilled its promises and the oath 
it made, to not be an alternative to popular will." The Brotherhood has also signaled that it will now accept several key 
SCAF demands that it had previously opposed. In this vein, immediately after his electoral victory was announced, Morsi 
stated that he would only be sworn in before the parliament, thereby pressuring the SCAF to reverse the parliament's 
dissolution. Yet he ultimately agreed to be sworn in before the Supreme Constitutional Court, which implicitly 
recognized the validity of the SCAF's constitutional declaration. Brotherhood leaders have also intimated that they can 
live with the power that the SCAF appropriated to itself via the constitutional declaration, at least for now. "The 
constitutional declaration doesn't give the SCAF full power -- just the right for legislation," al-Husseini, the Brotherhood 
parliamentary leader, told me. "The president has veto power." The Brotherhood even seems willing to accept SCAF's 
autonomy over military budgets, a key SCAF demand, so long as a small civilian committee is briefed on the details. "I 
can't bring the military budget in front of the parliament and discuss it publicly," Brotherhood parliamentarian Azza al-
Garf told me. "It should be discussed among a few people in parliament secretly." As a result, the military's vast business 
holdings, which are said to encompass between 15 and 40 percent of the Egyptian economy, appear safe for the time 
being. 
The Brotherhood's arrangement with the SCAF is not surprising. It is consistent with the organization's long-held 
strategy of avoiding confrontation with more powerful authorities by negotiating the extent of its political activities. In 
fact, Morsi was the Brotherhood's point man in these negotiations during the last five years of Mubarak's rule, using the 
dealings to coordinate the Brotherhood's participation in parliamentary elections and limited interaction with various 
protest movements. As a cohesive, 84 year-old society, the Brotherhood typically places organizational goals, such as 
achieving power incrementally, over broader societal goals, such as ending autocratic rule more immediately. "Our 
program is a long-term one, not a short-term one," Morsi told me in August 2010. "If we are rushing things, then I don't 
think that this leads to a real stable position." This hardly means, however, that the Brotherhood intends to 
accommodate the military indefinitely. Last November, for example, the SCAF and the Brotherhood struck a deal in 
which the Brotherhood agreed to avoid violent Tahrir Square protests in exchange for the SCAF's agreement to hold 
parliamentary elections on time. But the pact broke down in March, when the SCAF first threatened to dissolve the 
parliament and the Brotherhood suddenly dropped its promise that it would not run a presidential candidate. Moreover, 
the Brotherhood appears unlikely to accept long-term limits on the authority that it has won in the elections. "The army 
is owned by the people," said Brotherhood parliamentarian Osama Suleiman told me. "[Civilian oversight of the military] 
is the popular will -- and nobody can stop popular will." In short, the long-anticipated confrontation between the SCAF 
and Brotherhood has been delayed -- and, for that, many Egyptians are thankful. After all, Cairo seemed on the brink of 
disaster a few weeks ago, when tens of thousands of mostly Islamist protesters packed Tahrir Square, some declaring 
themselves ready to die if Shafik was named president. But the current calm, and the Brotherhood's attempt to appear
