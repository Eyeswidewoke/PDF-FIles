Regarding whether we want to do a merger or asset purchase, I will next forward 
Catherine's feedback. Our bid is lower than the competing bid to begin with but 
originally I was told their's was for equity. I don't know that we have enough 
details to know whether an asset sale structure could prompt the board to take 
the other bid. if an asset purchase, we would want all assets but technology 
would be most important. I will speak with Keith on this in the morn and give you 
his thoughts. 
Most importantly, please give your read on the Series A and B docs and whether we 
are clear on whether the investors that are coming out of all this with nothing, 
in fact, have no voice. I will forward what we have gotten related to the loan 
docs too. 
Thanks.

move straight to a short acquisition agreement? 
Sonia has already started an 
agreement that contemplates a merger but could be flipped easily into an asset 
sale as the approvals, most of the representations, etc are the same. It does 
appear that it would not be too difficult to effect the transaction as an asset 
sale, and this would to some extent insulate us from any seller-related 
liabilities that Jeffrey appears to be worried about. If we go this route it will 
be important for you to let us know which are the assets that have real value to 
you, so that we can confirm that they can be transferred without a problem.

> After the call Friday morning I followed up with Catherine to assure her we 
really want to get the deal done. I also specifically requested more color on why 
an asset sale is not practical instead of a merger. Early in the dialog we had 
been told it was because of all the contracts that would have to be reassigned. 
On the call it sounded like that was not necessarily a huge issue. She said it 
reflected the board's sentiment but she was not really sure of the rationale. She 
has not come back on this yet. Secondly, I stressed the importance of our seeing 
complete chronological detail on sources (principally loans) and uses of cash. 
She has supplied the detailed info on flow from loans. There were additional 
bridge loans taken post July 25 balance sheet we had. this has been a real 
lesson for me on how these vc firms take care of themselves! She has used some of
