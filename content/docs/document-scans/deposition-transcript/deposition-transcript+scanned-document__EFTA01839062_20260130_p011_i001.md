operator recorded the time as 1:31 PM, which was just over one hour after Diallo had first 
reported that she had been assaulted by the client in the presidential suite. 
The call can be heard in its entirety on a 911 tape [Appendix F]. After giving the address of 
the hotel, Branch reported only that a "room attendant" had been assaulted in a `sexual manner" 
by as hotel guest. When the 911 operator asked him if an ambulance should be sent, he replied 
that it was unnecessary because the victim had "no sustained injuries." Even though the records 
were available at the hotel, the security officer provided a time line that was falsely minimized the 
amount of time that had elapsed before the 911 call was made. He stated that the incident had 
taken place "30 or 40 minutes ago," when in fact it had occurred 80 minutes earlier, and that the 
guest had checked out of the hotel "20 minutes ago," when in fact DSK, had checked out 64 
minutes earlier. In any case, The 911 operator said she would dispatch a "squad car" at about 
1:32 PM. So the police were now on their way. 
By this time, the head engineer who was on and off his cell phone had received another text 
message from Sheehan. He briefly went outside then returned just as the 911 call was concluding. 
At 1:34:40, he walked by May, who then followed him through a door leading to the loading 
area. 
Here Yearwood and May were observed by another CCTV camera [See CCTV Tape F]. Both 
men speak briefly for a moment. Then they high-fived each other, clapped their hands, and 
danced so exuberantly that the security guard lifted actually the head engineer off the floor. These 
gyrations looked like the sort of victory dance seen in a football game after a winning goal is 
scored. [See CCTV Tape G]. 
Chapter IV 
The Arrest 
While the celebratory dance was taking place at the Sofitel, DSK was lunching 7 blocks away at 
McCormick & Schmick, a restaurant on 52nd Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenue. When 
he left the hotel at 12:28 PM, he had caught a taxi which then became delayed by heavy traffic 
and a street fair on Sixth Avenue. By the time he got there, as the restaurant's CCTV camera 
showed, it was 12:54 PM. His daughter Camille and her boyfriend were already there. Because it 
was to be a short lunch , he deferred to his daughter's request that he not to use his cell phone. At 
2:15 PM, DSK hailed a taxi to go to the airport. Almost immediately, when he sought to make a 
call, he discovered that his IMF BlackBerry was missing. It was the phone he had arranged just 
that morning to have examined for bugs when in Paris and it was the phone that contained the 
earlier text message warning him about the interception of his messages. 
At 2:16 PM he called Camille, who had also just left the restaurant, on one of his spare 
BlackBerry. He had her go back to the restaurant to search for his missing phone. CCTV footage 
at the restaurant shows her crawling under the table. At 2:28 PM she sent him a text message 
saying that she could not find the phone. Meanwhile. As DSK continued on to the airport, he still 
was attempting to locate the missing phone. At 3:01 PM, DSK was by calling it from his spare 
phone. He received no answer. 
What DSK did not know was that his phone had remained at the Sofitel after he left the hotel. 
As late as 12:51 PM, which was 23 minutes after DSK left the hotel„ the GPS on the phone 
showed it was still at the Sofitel, according to the records of the BlackBerry company Research In
