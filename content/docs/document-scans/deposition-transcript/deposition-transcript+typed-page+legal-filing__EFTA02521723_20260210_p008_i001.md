law- Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escap=ng her conclusion as Senator in 2007 that these schoolbooks along with 
oth=r media "profoundly poison(s) the minds of these children..=9D It is most important that we do not succumb to 
this type of use of symm=try that distorts the profound differences between us and the enemy. 
Essentially, we are not clear as a nation, participating in a world with=international rules, how to best fight this 
enemy. The first act of any rehab is to acknowledge that we d= not know how nor are we yet competent to stop our 
addictions. This i= not a book about policy. In fact, the "right" policies ar= unlikely to emerge until a critical mass has 
meaningfully dealt with thei= Control Factors and share a common perspective. We like to look at our hi=tory and 
assume a single perspective throughout but the truth is that we h=d to learn how to respond to Pearl Harbor, the Nazis, 
the Cold War etc. Th= same applies here. Our press promotes "elites" who are ta=ked with acting as if they possess the 
"true wisdom" to de=I with our threats but the truth is we do not know nor are we equipped to =arshal enough of our 
population to agree just yet. The sooner we learn, ho=ever, the less we will suffer. Mirroring has always been a key 
compon=nt of those lessons. 
I have been encouraged by some recent acts that have begu n to nip at the asymmetry. For years, the language 
of "feeling s" had been reserved for our enemy while we were limited to that of="action;" we would do terrible acts that 
would cause bad f=elings in the enemy which would then serve to justify whatever response it=made. It had always 
been a question of the harsh insensitive acts<=u> Westerners do against Muslims and the resulting hurt, lossshame etc. 
that Muslims experience. The Ground Zero Mosque i=cident, however, broke new ground because all of a sudden non-
MuslimsQ=804> feelings became the focus and were cast as resulting from Musli= acts. Another example was seen in 
how quickly the attempt to blame t=e Benghazi murders on the video about Mohammad fell apart. Just =s large 
corporations eventually learned to turn away from shakedown attemp=s from race baiters, we are beginning to learn to 
demand symmetry through =irroring. A word of caution: When enablers change their behavior and deman= symmetrical 
rules for the addict, the latter typically initially erupts with great resistance= This is a stage we must be prepared to 
tolerate and fully withstand as it=creates the only real chance for the addict to finally change. It is =ritical, therefore, 
that when we finally engage in mirroring that we be pr=pared to see it through completion. 
FP: What if we fail to engage in our own Inner Jihad and the Control Factor stays firmly in place? 
Siegel: Critic=l to the Inner Jihad is the realization that our civilization is fragile; =ot to be taken for granted. Our 
demands for multi-culturalism and diversit= have bumped heads with the simple paradox that tolerating the intolerant 
=eads to extinction. Tolerating the intolerant is perhaps the most crystall=ne version of asymmetry we have accepted. 
Seriously engaged Muslims M=ST place the Koran above all law while in America, the Constitution ranks =upreme. As 
Omar Ahmad , founder of CAIR, reputedly said, "Islam isn't in Amer ica to be equal to any other faith, but to become 
dominant. The Koran is th= highest authority in America and Islam is the only accepted religion on Errth." Who makes 
law- the people or Allah? While the Control Factor=constantly seeks for some accommodation between the two, this 
conflict CAN=NOT be negotiated. Only one can survive not because we have declared 4>=804>war" but because our 
Islamic Enemy has. That is, perhaps, therlesson we will most need to fully learn, one way or another. We will event=ally 
hit a Turnaround Moment as a nation and if enough of us are=not truly prepared to fight and continue to be controlled 
by our delusions= we will lose. If we truly seek to win, it is better to get there sooner w=ile we have advantages than 
later.
