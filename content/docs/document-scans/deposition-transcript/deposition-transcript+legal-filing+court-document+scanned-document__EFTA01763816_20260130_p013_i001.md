average U.S. vehicle in an average year accounts for more th=n 5 tons. The full carbon footprint of the average thrice-
weekly cheesebur=er: half a ton a year. One roundtrip cross-country flight: one ton. 
Each of these tons =f carbon dioxide causes

dix15a.pd=> at least $20 worth of damage in adverse health effects, flooded coastlines= and other effects of climate 
change. By mid-century, that figure will ris= to at least $50. And a truly catastrophic event caused by a warmer climat=, 
like Antarctic ice sheets collapsing long ahead of schedule or Arctic methane bubbling up at precipitous rates,=resulting 
in runaway global warming, could increase those costs by a facto= of 10 or more. How do you put a price tag on even a 1 
percent risk <http://wsl.ad.economics.harvard.edullaculty=weitzman/files/GHGTargetsInsuranceAgainst.pdf> of 
altering the climate so much that it could destroy civilization as we k=ow it? 
Few of us are payin= our fair share for the damage that we're doing to the planet. For example= airlines don't 
add $20 to ticket prices in order to pay for the damage caused per passenger by flying back and for=h across the 
country. That decreases costs up front, but it also comes at =normous cost to society down the road. The world's 
population -- led by th= one bi=lion or so global high emitters 
chttp://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/07/040905232106.abstract> -- are doing many hundreds of billions of 
dollars of damage to the planet,=and in the near future the costs will skyrocket into the trillions. 
"Free riding&q=ot; also plagues relations between countries. Some, like the European Unio= have a cap or tax 
on carbon pollution. Most are still waiting on the sidelines. Why should any single country cut its carbon emi=sions when 
it knows that its reductions will only be a drop in the bucket =oward solving climate change -- and other nations aren't 
asking their citi=ens to pay their fair share? Blame it on short election cycles, partisanship, or fossil energy interests, 
the=political will often doesn't exist -- whether in Washington or the latest =lobal environment gathering in Rio de 
Janeiro. 
Sitting in the driv=r's seat 
"Free riders&q=ot; are only half the problem. "Free drivers" may be as importan=. The allure of geoengineering 
derives from the simple fact that - given what little we know about it at the moment - it appears to be a co=paratively 
cheap way to combat climate change. And it doesn't take a globa= agreement to act. It takes one actor - one country - in 
the driver's seat= 
If, for example, th= very existence of an island, nation, city, or agricultural region is thre=tened by global 
warming, the question among its leaders will no longer be whether geoengineering is an option, but wha= the effects, 
positive and negative, might be and how it could be carried =ut. That's also where the science stands today, and the 
economics points i= the same direction. 
One option that wil= inevitably come under consideration is the possibility of shooting reflec=ing particles into 
the upper atmosphere to create an artificial sun shield for the planet. Blocking some of the sun's=rays from hitting the 
planet may sound like science fiction or hubris, or =oth. But geoengineers are already looking at which particles would 
work be=t, and how to deliver them: Planes, balloons or multiple mile-long hoses are all contenders. 
All these options h=ve one thing in common: They are cheap - at least from the narrow perspect=ve of those 
doing the geoengineering. Hence the "free" in "free driver." 
In fact, the price =ag of these geoengineering strategies is likely to be negligible relative =o the purported 
benefits: Columbia University's Scott =arrett <http://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/dire=tory/sb3116-fac.html> 
among others, has calculated that it would cost pennies to offset a ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. By 
comparison, it c=sts dollars per ton to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the first place.
