It is simple..you were leaving on thursday. She couldn't travel commercial and she could not travel with 
you on thursday anymore because it was her due date. ( You didn't even know this as you told me you 
thought the due date was was my birthday which would have made it ok to travel) I had this confirmed by 
a great vet who has been seeing her since I got her, loves her and has her best interest in mind and you 
called some office and asked a stranger who told you it could be ok if she flies. I chose to do what was 
safer for her. Then last night you asked me to come to NYC with you and leave her here for the day.. I 
decided not to go and be here in case it started during the day. It did. I followed the vets directions and 
brought her to the ER he recommended, he spoke to the doctors in the middle of the night, they did an 
ultrasound and we decided it was best to keep her there as the puppies might get stuck and i wouldn't 
know what to do. I only left her for 3 hours, went back and she delivered the pups under my vets 
supervision, with the other doctors help and me in the office to comfort her. She is doing well..

I had asked you repeatedly to let me bring her to new york , where there is staff, fcailities the best 
animal medical care , i told you the animal medical center was on 61 and the river, I had called 
them and they said no problem flying privately with balle. you had repeated over and over no, 
you would not travel because you wanted to stay with her. Knowing your love for that dog, i let 
you do as you pleased. you take it to an emergency facility in west palm, without knowing 
anything about the place or people. after weeks of talking about this , you tell me thatMand 
you, Mwho told you she knows nothing about these things , and as is your right you change 
your mind and leave the dog with strangers. it is your right to do as you please with your dog. I 
had asked that you come with me to new york , you told me you couldnx when i asked merely 
asked what happened , you kept saying why do you want to know, why did i want to know that 
after weeks of planning , and caring for the most important living thing in your life, you decide 
to leave it in a facility you know nothing about with people you know nothing about, because they 
are an animal center is so far from anything i can understand, so I aksed if you are ok, as i am 
trying to figure out why ,and what happended and all you do is keep asking why i want to know.
