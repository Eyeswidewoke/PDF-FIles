which recognizes Correa's "exceptional performance and unwavering commitment to the Joint Task Force, which

Sheriff's Office says the Director's Certificate is awarded to individuals who exemplify high standards of 
performance and commitment to the FBI's mission. 
Idaho Man Led FBI Case That Inspired 'The Order' Film 
The Coeur a'Alene Post Falls Press (11/20, Weeks) reported that death and danger were closer than FBI Special 
Agent Wayne Manis knew when he was embroiled in a 36-hour standoff on Whidbey Island, Wash., in early 
December 1984. According to the article, Manis and his team were in a shootout with Bob Mathews, who founded 
the white supremacist domestic terrorist group The Order in 1983. The Order's members had conducted armored 
truck robberies, murdered Jewish talk show host Alan Berg, and were building up their army to overthrow the 
government to create a whites-only America. The article stated that "The Order" starring Jude Law, a film inspired 
by the true events that took place in the Northwest, will be released Dec. 6. The film is based on journalist Kevin 
Flynn's nonfiction book "The Silent Brotherhood," on which Flynn closely worked with Manis. Manis also wrote 
about his experience in his book, "The Street Agent." This was the FBI's largest domestic terrorism investigation 
prior to the Oklahoma City Bombing. 
Opinion: Weaponizing of DOJ Was a Hatchet Job Against the American People — And the New Trump 
Admin Must Restore Trust 
An opinion piece by the New York Post (11/20, Devine) stated that the first priority of the Trump administration's 
new attorney general and FBI director will be to dismantle the ideological weaponization of the DOJ and FBI that 
has crushed the best people, forced the rest into silence and betrayed the American people. The author added that 
there are few better examples of how this malign machine works than the case of senior FBI Supervisory 
Agent Zach Schoffstall, who was forced out of the FBI after 16 years of exemplary service because he refused to go 
along with a domestic terrorism prosecution. According to the author, the story begins in the small town of Coeur 
d'Alene, Idaho, on June 11, 2022, where local police got a tip off that a "little army" of masked men was in a U-Haul 
truck en route to disrupt the annual Pride parade. They pulled the truck over and arrested 31 young men from the 
white nationalist group Patriot Front, dressed near-identically in navy tops, chinos and COVID masks, and carrying 
flagpoles and flags. The men, including the group's 2S-year-old founder, Thomas Rousseau, were charged with 
conspiracy to riot, a misdemeanor, and thrown in jail overnight to cool off. The author noted that Schoffstall was 
the FBI's supervisory senior resident agent at the time, he recalls pressure from Washington to find domestic 
terrorism in his region because of its sordid history with neo-Nazis such as the Aryan Nations group that had set up 
a compound near Coeur d'Alene two decades ago. Schoffstall believes the local community is still very sensitive to 
accusations of white supremacy, but the FBI couldn't just make up crimes that didn't exist. The author mentioned 
that when the Patriot Front turned up in Coeur d'Alene that Saturday, Attorney General Merrick Garland's DOJ 
seized on the opportunity to turn the case into proof of the domestic terrorism threat they had been itching to 
prosecute. But the local FBI agents refused to sign the warrants, says Schoffstall, because they deemed that there 
was no evidence that the Patriot Front guys were planning to riot and no justification for the over-the-top 
allegations in the search warrant since the 31 men had no guns, were not violent, had nothing to do with J6 and 
were a "lawful group formed for a legitimate activity." The agents' boss, Schoffstall, examined the evidence and 
backed his agents. The author quoted Schoffstall, who said, "I brought embarrassment to the Bureau. I refused to 
take a knee to the machine, agents should not be forced to lie under oath — that's our bread and butter. I would 
never bend the truth or make up evidence to get to the desired end. But I failed to read the room that this was 
going to happen whether I liked it or not." 
Opinion: The Right's Triumph Over Social Media 
An opinion piece by the New York Times (11/20, Angwin) stated that the red tide that swept across the nation in 
our recent election marked many things. One of them was a right-wing triumph over social media. Under heavy 
pressure from the right, and with the help of X owner Elon Musk, the leading tech platforms opened the 
floodgates for propaganda to spread unchecked. The result was a flood of lies and distortions flowing through our 
social media feeds. That led to possibly the most misinformed electorate we've ever seen. According to the author, 
many voters headed to the polls convinced that border crossings are higher than ever before, violent crime rates 
are rising and inflation is soaring. The author added that the wave of fake news was so bad that in the days leading 
up to this month's election, the FBI issued five press releases warning the public about lies circulating online —
including fake claims about FBI election monitoring activities and two rare joint statements with other intelligence
