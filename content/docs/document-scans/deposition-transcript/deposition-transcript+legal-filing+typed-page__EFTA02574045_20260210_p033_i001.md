"There is a lovely body=called Caring Friends in Bombay, where a few hundred people meet informall=. It's not an NGO, 
the two people who started it incubate NGOs which are new from their own money, and after a few years when they 
become=credible, bring it to the others and ask for money from them." 
Amit Chandra is managing =irector of Bain Capital and responsible for the firm's India initiative.=He is also chairperson of 
the Akanksha Foundation that works in the field of education for less privileged children. 
"Even though I came fro= a lower middle class family, we were always taught as children to give an= share whatever we 
had. For me the big inflection points were as I was working at DSP Merrill Lynch and I rose through the ranks, I got 
=uccess relatively early. I was running the firm before I was 35 but there =as still a sense of unease that I had with 
everything I saw around me. I t=ink the unease was on two counts, one was that by virtue of running what was the 
largest investment bank at =hat time I got to work with a lot of families and I realized that wealth d=d not necessarily 
translate into happiness when you really got to know a l=t of these people individually. 
"In fact, wealth built = sense of entitlement amongst the next generation, it built a sense of ext=eme bitterness amongst 
siblings, and it often was a source of great degree of unhappiness. And another thing, having had the opportun=ty to 
study in the West, I realized that when you look at leaders with leg=cy, a very vast percentage of leaders who had any 
degree of legacy where t=e ones who had given back to society. These issues were beginning to bother me. 
"My wife and I were ins=ired by what Chuck Feeney (Irish-American businessman and philanthropist a=d the founder of 
The Atlantic Philanthropies) did. We decided to cap the amount of wealth we wanted to have as a family, and so my wife 
=nd I walked into a lawyer's office, and I transferred how much she thoug=t was needed for her, my daughter, and to 
support my living, and we said f=om this day onwards everything else basically goes to charity. 
"What that did for us w=s actually incredible because our constraint after that point in time was =o find good causes 
that could be scaled up. That's where the Givelndia team came in extremely handy because we've set a budget every 
=ear for ourselves which is higher than the previous year with the objectiv= really being to effectively give away all our 
income every year.</=> 
"I think giving your ti=e is critical to being able to scale up giving your money. The two things =ave to go hand in hand. 
There is no substitute to actually giving time and approaching it the same way you would approach businesses =nd 
investments. The biggest network we use is the Givelndia network. Worki=g with their team allows us to screen and 
monitor, before that we were abl= to support a handful of NGOs. Now we have a reasonable portfolio across all the 
areas we are interested =n. I don't think that scale up would be able to happen if we hadn't le=eraged the Givelndia 
team."
