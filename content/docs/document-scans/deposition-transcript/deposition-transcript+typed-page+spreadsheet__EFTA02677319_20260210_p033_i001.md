2115 God's Politics: Evangelical Christianity and Social Reform 
Faculty White, Heather

10:00 AM • 11:40 AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7384 Sec A 
'This course investigates the relationship between Evangelical Protestantism and conservative 
politics. The most visible face of that relationship is the Christian Right, a network of faith-based 
advocacy organizations that have mobilized a well.knovrn vision of "family values" as a durable 
plank of the Republican agenda. Although the marriage between Evangelicalism and the 
Republican party might seem like a match ma® in heaven. it was actually a union forged through 
considerable conflict and maintained in recent years in the midst of elision and dissent among the 
practitioners and congregations the Christian Right purportedly represents. This class addresses 
the more complicated story of the contested making and maintenance of "God's Politics" in 
twentieth and twentgfirst century Protestant Evangelicalism.'
