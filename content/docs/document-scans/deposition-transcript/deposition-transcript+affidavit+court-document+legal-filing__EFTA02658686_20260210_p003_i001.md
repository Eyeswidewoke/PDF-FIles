However, =iven your assumptions, we should definitely have ironclad agreements, 
with=batteries of lawyers an notaries and witnesses, including an agreement tha= you will not contest my will, 
something that had never crossed my mind be=ore I learned about your assumptions -- which, I admit, I'm still havi=g 
trouble comprehending. 
It might be possible to work out all of thes= problems and develop a legal, specific and 
complete agreement based on th= framework you've proposed. Would you like to engage with me in =ome kind of 
process to attempt that? Other than having your lawyer t=lk to mine, do you have any suggestion about how to do so? 
Very simple. Proceed as above =/div>

My own view is different. To me the proposal=l suggested seems to be a very
