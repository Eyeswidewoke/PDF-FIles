international Deposit Account Sweep Program 
The Sweep Option for International Accounts is generally the UBS International Deposit 
Account Sweep Program (IDA). The IDA is an interest-bearing account maintained by UBS 
AG at the Cayman Islands Branch where funds are invested into short-term deposits. If 
you are eligible and choose to participate in the IDA sweep program, free cash balances in 
your Accounts are automatically deposited into a demand deposit account at the New York 
Branch of UBS AG, from which funds are then swept and re-deposited each business day 
into an overnight deposit account at the Cayman Islands branch of UBS AG. As your 
agent, UBS Financial Services Inc. will make the necessary withdrawals from the New York 
deposit account to satisfy debits or charges in your Account in accordance with the 
General Terms and Conditions. You may choose to withdraw from the IDA Program at any 
time, however, your free cash balances in your Account at UBS Financial Services Inc. will 
not earn interest or dividends. Funds on deposit in the accounts at the New York and the 
Cayman Islands branches of UBS AG are not eligible for federal deposit insurance from the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 
A full description of the IDA Sweep Program is included in the Agreements and Disclosures 
Booklet. At times, we may update or modify the terms of the IDA Sweep Program and/or 
change the Sweep Options we make available. 
UBS Visa Debit Card® 
The International RMA includes the UBS Visa Debit Card (Card). If you are eligible for the 
Card under applicable law and UBS policies and you request this feature either verbally or 
in writing, you will be issued one or more Card(s) by the Card Issuer. UBS or the Card 
Issuer will complete any transactions you initiate using the Card(s). Your use of the Card 
constitutes your agreement to the terms and conditions in the UBS Visa Debit Card 
Cardholder Agreement that is included in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. 
The Card Issuer will approve transactions up to your account's "Withdrawal Limit," as 
described in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. You agree to maintain sufficient 
available assets in your account to make payment in full and understand that transactions 
may be denied if there are insufficient assets in your account to make full payment for any 
Card transactions as they are processed. 
As your Card cash withdrawals are processed, we will deduct funds from your Account to 
reimburse the Card Issuer. Once each calendar month, we will deduct from your Account 
the amount of purchases made with the Card that have been received by the Card Issuer 
but not yet deducted from your Account. The Card Issuer may suspend or cancel Cards if 
there are insufficient assets to cover transactions. 
The features and fees of your 
International Resource Management 
Account are more fully described in 
the Agreements and Disclosures 
booklet. 
"Card Issuer" refers to UBS Bank 
USA, its successors or assigns, or 
the issuer of the UBS Card we 
appoint in our sole discretion. 
The UBS Credit Card and the UBS 
Rewards Program are not features 
of the International RMA.
