End of month. First XI v Worst XI performance update 
A quick look at performance for our global TMT top picks where we select our Alpha ideas on both the long and 
short side. We will be screening to see if any changes are necessary through June although the current state of play has 
played out well so far. The general style on the long side has reflected our top alpha ideas in eGaming, beneficiaries of 
GDPR implementation, value based MOAT and some specific stock picks. On the short sides stocks are mainly exposed to 
the OLED complex, old media, overpriced semiconductors and some specific stock picks. As a year to date proxy through 
1st of June the 'long basket' is +27% and the 'short basket' is -9.3%.

Amazon: did you know? 
US internet consumers begin their search for products on Amazon more than on search engines. Incredible.

Stand outs from the Kleiner Perkins trend report 
The annual release of Kleiner Perkins internet and digital trends report, all 294 slides of it, has some fascinating 
insights. A couple of things really stand out — such as how quickly China has risen to become a formidable global force, 
Amazon's scale is frightening (for many others), and digital/mobile based transactions are accelerating. Examples include 
how 60% of payments are done digitally, six hours a day are spent on a mobile (but mobile device volume growth is now 
basically zero), eCommerce hit 20% of China retail (and fastest growing in the world), US it is at 13%. Amazon R&D & 
Capex +45% YoY (Apple just 5%) and more than any other company and eCommerce sales growth and share is 
accelerating. 
A Few highlights: 
• 
Internet adoption: As of 2018, half the world population, or about 3.6 billion people, will be on the internet. 
That's thanks in large part to cheaper Android phones and Wi-Fi becoming more available, though individual services will 
have a tougher time adding new users as the web hits saturation. 
• 
Mobile usage: While smartphone shipments are flat and internet user growth is slowing, U.S. adults are 
spending more time online thanks to mobile, clocking 5.9 hours per day in 2017 versus 5.6 hours in 2016. 
• 
Mobile ads: People are shifting their time to mobile faster than ad dollars are following, creating a $7 billion 
mobile ad opportunity, though platforms are increasingly responsible for providing safe content to host those ads. 
Crypto: Interest in cryptocurrency is exploding as Coinbase's user count has nearly quadrupled since January 
2017 
Voice: Voice technology is at an inflection point due to speech recognition hitting 95% accuracy and the 
sales explosion for Amazon Echo which went from over 10 million to over 30 million sold in total by the end of 2017. 
Subscription services: They're seeing massive adoption, with Netflix up 25%, The New York Times up 43%, 
and Spotify up 48% year-over-year in 2017. A free tier accelerates conversion rates. 
• 
Ecommerce vs Brick & Mortar: Ecommerce growth quickens as now 13% of all retail purchases happen 
online and parcel shipments are rising swiftly, signalling big opportunities for new shopping apps. 
• 
Amazon: More people start product searches on Amazon than search engines now, but Jeff Bezos still relies 
on other surfaces like Facebook and YouTube to inspire people to want things.
