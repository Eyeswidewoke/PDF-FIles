Monarchies</span></u></b></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Christopher Davidso=</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">October 10, 2013 --=Since their modern formation in the mid-
twentieth century, Saudi Arabia an= the five smaller Gulf monarchies -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the=United 
Arab Emirates (UAE) --&nbsp;have 
been governed by highly autocratic and seemingly anachronistic regimes. Ne=ertheless, their rulers have demonstrated 
remarkable resilience in the fac= of bloody conflicts on their doorsteps, fast-growing populations at home,=and 
modernizing forces from abroad.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">One of the monarchi=s' most visible survival strategies has been 
to strengthen security ties=with Western powers, in part by allowing the United States, France, and Br=tain to build 
massive bases on their 
soil and by spending lavishly on Western arms. In turn, this expensive mil=tarization has aided a new generation of 
rulers that appears more prone th=n ever to antagonizing Iran and even other Gulf states. In some cases, gri=vances 
among them have grown strong 
enough to cause diplomatic crises, incite violence, or prompt one monarchy=to interfere in the domestic politics of 
another.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">lt would thus be a =istake to think that the Gulf monarchies are 
somehow invincible. Notwithst=nding existing internal threats, these regimes are also facing mounting ex=ernal ones --
from Western governments, 
from Iran, and each other. And these are only exacerbating their longstand=ng conflicts and inherent 
contradictions.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">The existence of su=stantial Western military bases on the 
Arabian Peninsula has always been p=oblematic for the Gulf monarchies. To their critics, the hosting of non-Ar=b, non-
Muslim armies is an affront 
to Islam and to national sovereignty. Their proliferation will likely draw=further criticism, and perhaps serve as yet 
another flashpoint for the reg=on's opposition movements.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Among the largest W=stern installations in the Gulf is al•Udeid 
Air Base in Qatar, which owes =ts existence to the country's former ruler, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-=hani. In 1999, al-
Thani told the United 
States that he would like to see 10,000 American servicemen permanently ba=ed in the emirate, and over the next few 
years, the United States duly beg=n shifting personnel there from Saudi Arabia. Today, al-Udeid houses sever=l thousand 
U.S. servicemen at a 
time and has also served as a forward headquarters of U.S. Central Command=(CENTCOM), a U.S. Air Force 
expeditionary air wing, a CIA base, and an arr=y of U.S. Special Forces teams. Nearby Bahrain

and the entire U.S. Fifth Fleet, which 
includes some 6,000 U.S. personnel. The United States recently downsized i=s force in Kuwait, but four U.S. infantry
