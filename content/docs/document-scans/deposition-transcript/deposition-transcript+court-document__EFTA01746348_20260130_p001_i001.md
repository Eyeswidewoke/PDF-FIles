I called him to ask if it was ok for him and I passed him the girl at the reception so he could 
confirm to her as well. Why didn't he say no ?

sorry again does not make any difference. if you run over a child because of your 
carelessness exageration and bullshit, do you think sorry will have any meaning, when the 
girl said she was sorry but got 5 years in jail, do you think sorry to her mother meant 
anything, you have caused an amazing amount of damage. . all because you thiniyaiself 
smart. and continue to do as you please against my advice. how crazy is it that= says 
yes to me and has accomplished much, you always say nn000 , and continue to do not 
well. . isn't it simple I tell you no photos and you give me your version of why its ok . 
do you think you know more. ? smarter? what possoible reason woudl you think its ok to 
do opposite to what i tell you the right thing to do is. . you say not well mannered to take 
a shower in a strangers room that you don't ask, . ??? after being told be careful. '21

Jeffrey, I miss understood. When I arrived at the hotel I really thought I had to leave my 
luggage in his room. I also called him to ask if it was ok for him and I passed him the girl at 
the reception so he could confirm to her as well. Why didn't he say no to me or her ? Then I 
admit it's not very polite to take a shower in someone else room but I really needed it ( I 
didn't want to smell like the plane ) and since he wasn't there I took the occasion to take a 
quick one. I don't see nothing wrong or suspicious about doing this exept the fact that it is 
not polite and well-mannered. Then, when he arrived in the room I was about to leave so I 
was dressed and the bathroom was completly in order. I told him I took a shower and that's 
it. You can tell him I am really sorry about it and I apologize for this again.
