Notice of Changes to Your Agreement 
We are making Important Changes to your American Express Cardmember Agreement ("Agreement, governing the American Express°
Card Account identified on this Notice. 
Unless otherwise indicated below, these changes become effective with billing periods beginning on or after May 1, 2005, whether or not you 
receive a billing statement. This Notice formally amends your Agreement, and any contrary or conflicting language in that Agreement is 
replaced fully and completely. Note that the terms of your Account are subject to change (Including increasing APRs/DPRs and fees, 
changing fixed APRs/DPRs to variable APRs/DPRs, and adding new terms) In accordance with the Agreement governing your Account. All 
terms of the Agreement not amended herein remain In full force and effect. 
This Is an Important Notice of changes to your Agreement We recommend that you carefully review these changes, share them with any 
Addilonal Cardmembers on your Account, and keep this Notice for future reference. If you have questions regarding.this Notice, please call 
the telephone number listed on the back of your American Express Card. 
Changes to Grace Period (Effective with billing periods beginning on or after May 4, 2005) 
We are changing the grace period applicable to your Account. A "grace period" is the period of time in which finance charges are not 
assessed on certain balances. Previously, if you paid the new balance on your prior statement in full by the payment due date, finance 
charges wou:d not be assessed on purchases during the current billing period. We are changing the grace period so that when you pay the 
prior new balance by the payment due date, finance charges will be assessed on purchases during the current billing period until the date 
that full payment of the prior new balance was received; purchases will not have a grace period for the entire billing period in this instance. 
However, if you paid the new balance on each of your two prior statements by their respective payment due dates, you will not be assessed 
finance charges on purchases for the entire current billing period. Also, if the previous balance on your billing statement is zero or a credit 
balance, no finance charges will be assessed on your purchase balance for the billing period. There is no longer any grace period for 
balance transfers. Accordingly, we are replacing subsection A of the Finance Charges section of your Agreement with the following: 
"A. Finance Charges begin to accrue for each Charge as of the date the Charge is added to the daily balance, as described below. If 
payment in full for any New Balance shown on the statement for a billing period is credited to your Account by the Payment Due Date 
shown on that statement, then Finance Charges will not accrue for Purchases from the date on which payment in full of that New 
Balance is credited to your Account until the end of the billing period in which such payment is credited to your Account. In addition. 
Finance Charges will not accrue for Purchases during a billing period if (a) the Previous Balance shown on the billing statement for that 
billing period is zero or a credit balance, or (b) payment in full for the New Balance, if any, shown on the statements covering the two 
immediately preceding billing periods is credited to your Account by the respective Payment Due Dates shown on those statements. 
For purposes of this paragraph, Purchases do not include Balance Transfers cr convenience checks.' 
Determining the Prime Rate Applicable to your Account 
We are changing the timing of when we determine the Prime Rale used to calculate the variable APRs (and corresponding DPRs) applicable 
to your Account. Accordingly, we are replacing subsection C of the Finance Charges section of your Agreement with the following: 
"C. The 'Prime Rate" Is determined once with respect to each billing period. The Prime Rate for each billing period is the Prime Rate 
published In the Money Rates section (or successor section) of The Wall Street Journal on (a) the first day of that billing period or (b) the 
day that is two days prior to the Closing Date of that billing period, whichever is higher. In each case, if such a day is not a customary 
publication day for The Wall Street Journal, we will substitute the closest preceding day that is a customary publication day. If The Wall 
Street Journal ceases or suspends publication, we may refer to the Prime Rate published in any other newspaper of general circulation 
in New York, New York, or we may substitute a similar reference rate at our sole discretion. Any increase or decrease to an APR 
resulting from a change In the Prime Rate takes effect as of the first day of the billing period. An increase in the Prime Rate means that 
the variable APRs (and corresponding DPRs) applicable to your Account will increase and you may incur higher Finance Charges and 
may have a higher Minimum Amount Due." 
Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (Effective May 8, 2005) 
As part of the changes to grace period described above, we are deleting the first sentence of the second paragraph of the Average Daily 
Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges section of your Agreement. We are also adding the following two sentences to the 
end of that section: 
"In our sole discretion, we also may round any calculations made in determining the Finance Charges on your Account in any way that 
is convenient to us. Any such rounding may apply to or cause variations in your DPRs." 
Balance Transfer Transaction Fees 
We are replacing subsection 5 of the Other Fees section of your Agreement with the following: 
"5. Balance Transfer Fee: We may assess a transaction fee for each Balance Transfer on your Account, as disclosed in the applicable 
Promotional Offer or at the time of the transaction. This fee, if assessed, is a FINANCE CHARGE.' 
Balance Transfers and Convenience Checks (Effective May 8, 2005) 
We are amending the Agreement to clarify that convenience checks we provided to you that are used for certain purposes will be treated as 
a Cash Advance. Accordingly, we are replacing the second sentence of the second paragraph of the Using the Card section of your 
Agreement with the following: 
"A convenience check that we identify as having been made payable to cash, to you, or to a bank, brokerage or similar asset account. 
or to a mortgage provider or insurance provider will be treated as a Cash Advance." 
Arbitration (Effective May 8, 2005) 
We are amencing certain subsections of the Arbitration section of your Agreement as follows (references to subsections below refer to 
those subsections in the Arbitration section of your Agreement): 
We are replacing the first sentence of the Definitions subsection with the following: 
"As used in this Arbitration Provision, the term 'Claim" means any claim, dispute or controversy between you and us arising from or 
relating to your Account, this Agreement, the Electronic Funds Transfer Services Agreement, and any other related or prior agreement 
that you may have had with us, or the relationships resulting from any of the above agreements ("Agreements"), except for the validity, 
enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Provision or the Agreements."
