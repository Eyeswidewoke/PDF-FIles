10.1 
Restrictions on Transfers of Interest. 
10.1.1 No sale, transfer, pledge, charge, hypothecation, exchange, assignment or other 
disposal of, and no creation of a derivative or security interest with respect to, any portion of a 
Member's Interest, whether directly or indirectly (each, a "Transfer"), may be made without the 
prior written consent of the Manager, which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole 
discretion of the Manager; provided however that a Transfer between a Member and its 
Affiliates shall be permitted without requiring the prior consent of the Manager (but with notice 
to the Manager). Any act by a Member in violation of this Section 10.1 shall be void ab initio and 
not be binding upon or recognized by the Fund (regardless of whether the Manager has 
knowledge thereof), unless approved or consented to in writing by the Manager. 
10.1.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Transfer of a 
Member's Interest shall be made unless the Manager has been satisfied that: 
(i) 
when added to the total of all other Transfers of Interests within the 
preceding twelve months, it would not result in the Fund being considered to have 
terminated for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 
(ii) 
it would not violate any applicable securities laws including any investor 
suitability standards applicable to the Fund or the Interest that is the subject of the 
Transfer; 
(iii) 
it would not cause the Fund to lose its status as a partnership for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes; and 
(iv) 
it would not otherwise adversely affect the status of the Fund under any 
applicable law. 
10.1.3 Each Member Transferring its Interest shall pay all reasonable expenses, 
including attorneys' fees, incurred by the Fund in connection with such Transfer, if approved as 
provided herein. 
10.1.4 The Transfer of a Member's Interest and the admission of a Substituted Member 
shall not be cause for dissolution of the Fund. 
10.2 
Assignees. 
10.2.1 The Fund shall not recognize for any purpose any purported Transfer of an 
Interest of a Member unless all the provisions of this Agreement shall have been complied with 
and there shall have been filed with the Fund a notification of such Transfer, in form satisfactory 
to the Manager, executed and acknowledged by both the Member requesting the Transfer (the 
"Transferor") and the other party to the proposed Transfer (the "Transferee"), and such 
notification (i) contains the acceptance by the Transferee of all of the terms and provisions of this 
Agreement and of the Fund's Subscription Agreement and related documents approved by the 
Manager, if applicable, and (ii) represents that such Transfer was made in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. Any Transfer shall be recognized by the Fund as effective only 
as of such date as shall be designated by the Fund as reasonably convenient for it. 
10.2.2 The Transferee of a Member's Interest, unless and until admitted as a Substituted 
Member in such Member's stead in the sole discretion of the Manager, shall not have any
