Hi Katie, I'm Ted, how are you? 
Heard a lot of wonderful things about you, and hopefully you've heard 
nothing of me. Look forward to meeting you sometime, but email will have to suffice in the meantime. 
Ghislaine made me promise that I wouldn't ask you anything about her or I wouldn't be the beneficiary 
of your wonderful services, so I absolutely will not ask you to give me any dirty details, tell me any funny 
stories, or do anything that would allow us to have a good laugh at her expense. 
I will not, you can't 
make me, etc. etc. etc. 
On a totally unrelated subject, and just so you can get to know me better, I am very good at keeping 
secrets, I have a horrible memory, and when I hear something I immediately forget it, and forget who I 
heard it from, and I do love to laugh by the way 
anyway on to the real business 
So, here's the deal. 
I'm in the process of helping to work the details of a family trip to London and 
Ghislaine told me you'd be willing to help arrange things for them; cars, meals, day trips, Sights, etc. I 
want them to be able to work directly with you, and I will pay you for your services, and I will be paying 
for all their expenses as well. 
The plan now is, my mom, Joan, my sister Cindy and her 21 year old 
son Ben, 
sister Marcia and her 18 year old daughter Stephanie, myself and potentially my 14 year old 
daughter Mil 
will be arriving in London sometime on the 6th, and they will be staying through the 12th. 
Here's some other relevant facts: 
I. They currently have rooms reserved at the Capital Hotel, I have no idea whether it's nice or 
not. Those arrangements we made by my brother. 
2. My brother and his wife Amanda will be arriving separately on or about the 4th I think. They 
have their own arrangements for the most part. 
3. My brother wants to celebrate his 50th birthday with his family while there, so we will need a 
place to do that either at the front end of the trip or the back end. 
4. My mom has some very specific things she wants to do. She also doesn't get around so well. 
She's in pretty good shape and is only 73, but she's had several surgeries that make it hard for 
her to walk long distances etc. I'll forward more details of what she wants as we progress, or 
ideally just put the two of you together via phone or email which works for everyone as well. 
Anyway, so that's enough for now. Let me know what I need to do to proceed. 
What I'd like to do, 
should you choose to accept this assignment, is then put you directly in touch with them so you can
