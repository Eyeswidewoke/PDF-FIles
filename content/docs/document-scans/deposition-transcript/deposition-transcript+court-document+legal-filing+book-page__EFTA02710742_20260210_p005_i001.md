In 2003, the Other Ones changed their name to the Dead. The Dead toured the country in 2003 
and 2004. In 2008, members of the Dead played two concerts, called "Deadheads for Obama" 
and "Change Rocks". In 2009 the Dead performed on a spring tour, and were at the Rothbury 
Music Festival on July 4, 2009. 
Following the 2009 summer reunion tour bandmates Lesh and Weir formed the band Furthur 
which debuted in September 2009.[37] Joining Lesh and Weir in Furthur are Jeff Chimenti 
(keyboard), John Kadlecik (guitar), Joe Russo (drums), Sunshine Becker (vocalist), and Jeff 
Pehrson (vocalist) Jay Lane ( percussion). 
In 2010, Hart and Kreutzmann re-formed the Rhythm Devils, and played a summer concert 
tour. 
Since 1995, the former members of the Grateful Dead have also pursued solo musical careers. B 
ob Weir & RatDog have performed many concerts and released several albums, as have Phil 
Lesh and Friends. Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann have each led several different bands and 
have also released some albums. Recently Mickey Hart has been working with his Mickey Hart 
Band and Kreutzmann has been touring with BK3, and with 7 Walkers, a band he formed with 
Papa Mali. Donna Godchaux has returned to the music scene, with the Donna Jean Godchaux 
Band, and Tom Constanten also continues to write and perform music. All of these groups 
continue to play Grateful Dead music. 
In October 2014 it was announced that Martin Scorsese will produce a yet-to-be-named 
documentary directed by Amir Bar-Lev. David Lemieux will supervise and Weir, Hart, 
Kreutzmann and Lesh have agreed to new interviews for the film. 
Scorsese quoted "The Grateful Dead were more than just a band, they were their own planet, 
populated by millions of devoted fans. I'm very happy that this picture is being made and proud 
to be involved." And the Band replied "from The Last Waltz to George Harrison: Living In The 
Material World, from Bob Dylan to the Rolling Stones, he has made some of the greatest music 
documentaries ever with some of our favorite artists and we are honored to have him involved." 
Musical style 
The Grateful Dead formed during the era when bands such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys and 
the Rolling Stones were dominating the airwaves. "The Beatles were why we turned from a jug 
band into a rock 'n' roll band," said Bob Weir. "What we saw them doing was impossibly 
attractive." Former folk-scene star Bob Dylan had recently put out a couple of records featuring 
electric instrumentation. "I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing," Garcia said. 
Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York 
City band the Lovin' Spoonful that they decided to "go electric" and look for a dirtier sound. 
Gradually, many of the East-Coast American folk musicians, formerly luminaries of the coffee-
house scene, were moving in the electric direction. It was natural for Jerry Garcia and Bob 
Weir, each of whom had been immersed in the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and 
early 1960s, to be open-minded toward electric guitars. Their first LP (The Grateful Dead, 
Warner Brothers, 1967), was released in the same year that Pink Floyd released The Piper at the 
Gates of Dawn and the Beatles released Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. 
The Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-196os) was part of the process of establishing what 
"psychedelic music" was, but theirs was essentially a "street party" form of it. They developed 
their "psychedelic" playing as a result of meeting Ken Kesey in Palo Alto, California, and
