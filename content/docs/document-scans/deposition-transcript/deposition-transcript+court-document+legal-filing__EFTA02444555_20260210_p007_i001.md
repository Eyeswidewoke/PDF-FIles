The Whitesides Lab 
606-064 
In some respects, Whitesides was considered an unusual advisor. The prestige and fame resulted 
in lots of travel and he was often not in his office. And when he was there, his time was divided 
between lab members and university colleagues all vying for face time. However, Whitesides was 
very effective with email. Lara Estroff commented, "Through emails, George ends up being much 
more than a hands-off type of advisor. I get emails from him asking whether I've done the 
experiment we talked about, asking my take on a research idea. So, even though we hardly see him, 
he ends up being a pretty hands-on advisor and it amazes me that he can keep track of everything 
that's going on in the lab." 
A lab bulletin circulated in the research group every quarter. Two bulletins contained short 
research summaries from every project: basically, the title of the projected paper, the authors, and a 
few sentences summarizing the content. Twice a year, researchers provided a more detailed 
description of their projects in the bulletins, and included data, charts, and photographs. The short 
version of the lab bulletin contained about 40 pages, while the semi-annual, long version was over 80 
pages. As Weibel noted, 
The bulletins have multiple purposes. First, they keep George abreast of what everyone is 
working on. Second, and probably just as important, they keep everyone abreast with what 
everyone else is working on, so that there is no duplication. This approach also provides an 
easy way to figure out what projects you are interested in, projects you might want to 
collaborate on and contribute to. 
From Bench Experiments to Published Research 
Whitesides had a very well-defined structure of how a research paper should be written and how 
the internal review process should work. Weibel commented, 
As soon as you have one really interesting research result with your project, you write 
what's called an outline. You write basically a three- to five-page document that has bulleted 
points with the one result in it and the corresponding figures. It is formatted just like a journal 
article. And you put a cover page on it explaining what you've done. You put it into a folder. 
You label the folder in a certain way and put it in George's mailbox. 
This paper creation cycle repeated itself over the duration of the project as new results were 
discovered and new drafts written, until the paper was published. This became the process for each 
team to report to Whitesides on a regular basis. Gudiksen explained: 
We have to prepare a draft for George that we receive back usually within one or two 
weeks with George's detailed comments. The review process is an important part of our work. 
If he has not seen a new version recently, you receive an email from George asking for it or, at 
least, for a good explanation for why the report is not yet in his mailbox. 
Each new draft was put in a standardized folder, the cover of which indicated the title of the 
project, its authors, and a list of dates to track the project's progress, and placed in Whitesides' 
mailbox outside his office (see Figure A). Usually a letter preceded the draft, explaining details of the 
project or asking specific questions for Whitesides to answer, and specifying potential outlets for the 
paper. The same folder went back to the authors a week or two later with Whitesides' comments. His 
feedback included comments on the ideas, how they were executed, and the writing (see Exhibit 7 for 
an example). Usually, around 10 iterations of this type occurred during the life of a project before the 
paper was ready to submit to a journal. Project termination was rare; when a specific research idea
