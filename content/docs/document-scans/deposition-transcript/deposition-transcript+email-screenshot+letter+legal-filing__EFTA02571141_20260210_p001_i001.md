A, 
It was a true treat to have french brie in a Japanese garden in paris with=a person who appears to understand the 
nuances of gardening and its relati=nship to real life. Your kindness was greatly appreciated. I thought I'd attempt a 
modest return of the kindness by providing you=my thoughts on our conversation. These thoughts are tailored , less 
like your bed sheets=, but more like a bath towel. more warm encompassing and hopefully=20 functional. 
I thought i might share some of my past experiences with so=e of the worlds most interesting thinkers that at I, at 
least, have found=to be beneficial. - before doing that however-, I was serious in statt=ng that I owe a signifigant debt 
to Edmonde, his principles that he so generously=shared with me 30 years ago has acted as a compass for my business 
l=fe. Aesthetics are a core factor and i try to keep them in mind =s I craft solutions to financial problems . Each 
problem has a myriad of solutions but few are truly beautiful. His ideas of the role of a " banker " was glorious. social 
respons=bity from both the top down and the bottom up. - 
Banking businesses have become similar to systems that can only =20 be compared to biology. or garden ecology. 
The entitites ea=h have what on first blush appear to have many independent , flowers, or systems, that require 
energy balance and an overall=health. Unlike the thinking of the past ,that was sculpted by the langu=ge of the 
industrial revolution . People and orgaanizations were described=in machine like terms, In essence push the button 
here and something we already expect or know to happen , will =ccur. In math , we say the outcomes were 
determined, As systems bec=me more complex, this no longer happens. We fertilize the tree as it looked unhealthy, 
but then it grew =o large and thick that the moss underneath had no light and killed the pla=ts. In biological tersm, to 
paraphrase your words -all successful=systems need to have the same DNA, HOWEVER, each bush must first grow on 
its own, . Our heart pumps blood , the liver cleans it, they dont share the same=A0 responsibilities but they must be 
independent while at the same time =orking for the benefiit of the system, Asking finance people to become 
philanthropists and philanthropists financia= enginneers , is usually if evolution is a guide, a sub optimal soluiton ., It 
works in small businesses, or a singel flower=pot but as the many divisions get larger and more autonomous, 
speciailizaation, ( again biological system). is the way millions of years of trial and error have proven most effective. 
If you were once again to focus on being the banker to the=20 world leaders, giving them what they themselves 
require, help, guidance , expertise, it is my experience that they are always more agr=eable to then helping their own 
people. Entrepeneurs do not exist in Africa, we disagree, I be=ieve they are merely agents of large foreign companies, 
it is almost impossible to find a new disruptive technology that has come out of the enitre continent. =AO ( I as you 
might already know have had the privledge to sit on=the Trilateral commission for years when the Rockefeller focus 
and dream was for Latin America t= develop on its own, . ) Davids idealism was strong but inversely proportional to the 
results. It took new, young thinking from the outside to bring Columbia and Brazil to their p=tentials. I would sugggest 
that the unique scope of your reach, and the worlds most exclusive financail brand ,=can go a long way to making 
posiitive change, in many places, but I beli=ve keeping in mind that hope should guide a strategy , not dictate it. 
As you are a senstive soul you realize I , like you, spe=k my mind, directly . Edmonds caution to me re his own family 
and what =e believed to be its future complications have proven prescient. 
W=en I am next in europe , if you think you might find it interesting and fun I am more than happy to spend more time 
to talk gardening ,shooting biology, =( ill stay away from tech ). 
I remain, the idealistic gard=ner,
