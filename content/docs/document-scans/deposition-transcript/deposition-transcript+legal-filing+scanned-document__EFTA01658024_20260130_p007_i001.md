Wolf: Joint Federal-Local Policing Has "Worked Fairly Well" In Portland. 
Appearing on Fox News' Fox & Friends (7/31, 831K), Wolf said the developments in Portland 
"worked fairly well. What we saw is we saw a robust contingent of Oregon State Police come 
into the area yesterday afternoon together with Portland Police Bureau. They cleaned out the 
parks across the street from the courthouse and what we saw overnight is almost little to no 
criminal activity. And that really is how it should be. It reinforces the principle if you work with 
federal state and local law enforcement work together we can protect our communities. We can 
secure our communities. We can secure federal properties and protect law enforcement officers. 
This is what we have been asking for or over 60 days and I'm glad Oregon and Portland has 
finally accepted up to the challenge."
