Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) revealed that the Trump administration identified a backlog of 
65,000 reports filed by workers about children in custody or their sponsors who warranted concern. The article 
noted that last year, Grassley drew attention to HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement's poor vetting of sponsors 
who applied to take in children who had come over the border without their parents. Grassley's office reviewed 
HHS contractor records that revealed children were being placed with suspicious sponsors, such as situations that 
suggested they were being trafficked, smuggled, and exploited. Those records were provided by HHS 
whistleblowers and then forwarded to the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security 
Investigations. 
El Paso FBI Leader Talks of Immigration Enforcement, Tren de Aragua Gang and More 
The El Paso Times (05/29, Borunda) reported that the FBI's El Paso Division, led by Special Agent in Charge John S. 
Morales, has been heavily involved in immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. According to the 
article, key accomplishments of the division include the arrests of Sinaloa cartel leader Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada 
and Barrio Azteca gang leader Eduardo "Tablas" Ravelo, as well as the discovery of a cross-border tunnel. The FBI is 
working with ICE to target criminals, not immigrants seeking a better life, Morales said. The article quoted Morales, 
who said, "We are not out there just picking people up to be picking people up. We are looking to be able to take 
the bad people off the streets, the folks who are committing crimes." 
The U.S. Is Storing Migrant Children's DNA in a Criminal Database 
WIRED (05/29, Mehrotra) reported that the United States government has collected DNA samples from upwards of 
133,000 migrant children and teenagers, and uploaded their genetic data into a national criminal database used by 
local, state, and federal law enforcement, according to documents. The article noted that the records, quietly 
released by the US Customs and Border Protection earlier this year, offer the most detailed look to date at the scale 
of CBP's controversial DNA collection program. They reveal for the first time just how deeply the government's 
biometric surveillance reaches into the lives of migrant children. According to the article, the DO1 has argued that 
extensive DNA collection activity at the border provides "an assessment of the danger" a migrant potentially 
"poses to the public" and will essentially help solve crimes that may be committed in the future. Experts say that 
the children's raw genetic material will be stored indefinitely and worry that, without proper guardrails, the DNA 
dragnet could eventually be used for more extensive profiling. The DNA samples are registered in the Combined 
DNA Index System, or CODIS, a database administered by the FBI, which processes the DNA and stores the resulting 
genetic profiles. A network of criminal forensic databases, CODIS is used by local, state, and federal enforcement 
agencies to match DNA collected from crime scenes or convictions to identify suspects. 
FBI Donates Body Armor to Iowa Police Department 
KTIV (NBC-4) (05/29, McMahan) reported that agents from the FBI's Sioux City field office presented police in 
Storm Lake, Iowa, with body armor. As part of the FBI's "Legacy Body Armor program, the agency has donated 140 
pieces of armor to 15 agencies in the Siouxland area. Twelve kits went to the Storm Lake Police Department. This 
program operates on an as-needed basis, as determined by the FBI when communicating with various 
agencies. "So what we do is we reach out to the local departments, see if they have a need. If they do, then we 
reach back out to FBI headquarters, the defensive system unit, and that just starts the logistical program to get the 
pieces of armor out here," said Supervisory Senior Resident Agent Josh Lesieur. 
Larry Hoover 'Deserves to Be in Prison; Chicago FBI Boss Says of Gangster Disciples Founder as Lawyers 
Praise Trump Choice 
The Chicago Tribune (05/29, Meisner) reported that a day after Donald Trump's decision to commute the federal 
life sentence of Larry Hoover, lawyers for the Chicago-born Gangster Disciples founder were singing the president's 
praises while Chicago's new FBI boss said that Hoover "deserves to be in prison?' According to the article, President 
Trump abruptly ended Hoover's long quest to win early release under the First Step Act by granting a full 
commutation of his sentence Wednesday afternoon, directing the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to release him 
"immediately," according to a copy of the document provided by Hoover's legal team. But Hoover is still serving a 
200-year sentence for his state court conviction for murder, making him likely to stay behind bars. "The President of 
the United States has the authority to pardon whoever he wishes," FBI Special Agent in Charge Douglas DePodesta 
said during an interview on unrelated topics. "I think Larry Hoover caused a lot of damage in this city and he 
deserves to be in prison and he will continue to be imprisoned in the state system?' As of Thursday, Hoover was still 
stationed at the supermax prison compound in Florence, Colorado, that he's called home for the past two decades,
