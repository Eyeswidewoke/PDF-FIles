Meeting between Better Roads and Boyson - July 16, 2014 
Greetings Sir. 
Notes from meeting this morning between Mr. Jeffers of Better Roads and Mrs. Jackson of Boron Inc: 
Better Roads originally planned to mobilize their equipment and lighter materials on Monday. August 4. using Boyson. spend that first week prepping. 
and begin laying the asphalt the week of August 11. 
As my understanding was that you wanted them to begin the actual laying of the asphalt as soon as possible. I recommended using Big N for the 
mobilization on Monday. July 28. and complete the necessary preparations so they can begin to lay the asphalt on Monday. August 4. 
Both are in agreement. Better Roads will coordinate with LSJ on transportation needs for the week of July 28. 
Better Roads will need to move about 75-80 truckloads of asphalt in total for the project They will need 5-7 truckloads per day. Better Roads had 
planned a 5 day per week schedule. but Geyser+ asked Better Roads if they are open to working through Saturday and Sunday. as their schedule tends 
to be slower and more flexible. and it would also shorten the timeline for the project. Better Roads was receptive to this recommendation of a 6 or 7 day 
per week schedule. and will work on this option. 
Boyson can move 2.3 trucks per trip. They would require that Better Roads is al Red Hook for pickup as earty as possible to catch the high tide. Better 
Roads will be at Red Hook at 6:30 am with all 6 loads. Boyson will take the first group (2-3 trucks). turn right around and deliver the second group. and 
third group it needed. Boyson would then come back before the end of the day to return tie 6 empty trucks to STT. Better Roads will reserve the trucks 
for this job only, so that Boyson does not have to make extra runs to return empty trucks for other jobs on STT. 
Big N would be the standby vessel in the event Better Roads needs an extra load for that day. or if they needed to transport support equipment. 
To summarize. here are the tentative proposed schedules outlined for your review: 
Plan A 
Week t: July 28. August 1 Using Big N Better Roads mobilizes equipment to LSJ. begin prep work on LSJ 
Week 2: August 4-August 8 - Using Boyson - Better Roads paving (30 loads) 
Week 3: August 11.August 15 - Boyson Better Roads (30 bads) 
Week 4: August 18-August 20 - Boyson - Better Roads (20 loads) 
Plan B 
Week 1: July 28- August 1 - Using Big N - Better Roads mobilizes equipment to LSJ. begin prep work on LSJ 
Week 2: August 4-August 10: Using Boyson - Better Roads paving (42 loads) 
Week 3: August 11-August 17 - Boyson - Better Roads (38 loads) 
I will forward your preferences and concerns for Boyson and Better Roads to make the adjustments for your review. 
We plan to speak again on Monday. July 21. 
Mr. Jeffers reported that he was advised that a permit is required. He will obtain the necessary paperwork and assist with the permitting process. He 
does not anticipate any complications or delays to the start of the project on August 4. I will check with him tomorrow to make sure he has started the 
process. 
Respectfully submitted.
