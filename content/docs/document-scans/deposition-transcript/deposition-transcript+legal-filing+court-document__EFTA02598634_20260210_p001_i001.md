Dear Jeffrey, 
Thank you very, very much for=your email. I have been thinking about you for the past week, but I have h=nestly 
not wanted to disturb you as you have been very kind and generous w=th your time this autumn. 
First of all, I hope that you are well=wherever in the world you are! 
I am sincerely and very very sorr= that you think that I was un-polite when we last met. I asked the questio= to 
show my interest for Reid Hoffman and his background — NOT to =e shameless, bold, and with no other intention than to 
show him that I was=interested. I felt that it was too egoistic of me to sit there and only sp=ak about my trip to 
Zimbabwe and myself. May I kindly ask, in this particu=ar situation; what would you have advised me to talk about? 
What questions=would have been fine to ask? I must note, however, that it was such a priv=lege to meet you again and 
Reid Hoffman that morning. 
I went=to H&M the 8th of December as planned but a problem arose. I had, prio= to departure, had meetings 
with the person responsible for visas at H&=M. I had been told that all my papers were in order. However, I had not 
be=n advised that I needed an American social security number to work for the= (I have been able to use my Swedish 
one for five years). H&M acknowle=ge that it was not my fault (as I had made sure that I fulfilled their req=irements) but 
that I could not start to work until I have an American soci=l security number. As it takes about 2 - 6 weeks to get one, I 
had to retu=n home to Sweden (as it is too expensive to be in NY without a salary). =AO I will return to NYC again after 
Christmas (probable before New Years E=e). Last week I got another possibility from an investor in NYC. 
I also wanted to wish you a fantastic C=ristmas; may it be filled with much joy. 
With warmest and best r=gards,
