Hi 
I'm so =lad you caught me this morning; we're on the west coast so we =eren't open yet, but the call forwarded 
to my personal =umber. 
So to answer your question about personal =pplications, we offer a few different types of systems to our 
=ustomers. For true 360-degree digital globe displays, we work closely =ith Pufferfish Displays, the world leader in digital 
globes. They have = few models, including the flagship high-resolution "touch"=globe that functions like a spherical 
touchscreen. This is commonly =sed in museums and universities, and costs over $100k because it is a =ery customized 
product that utilizes professional-grade components (the =rojector alone is $40k). We do rent this model for special 
events, =hows, etc. at a rate of approximately $3000/day (some of our personal =lients have chosen this route). For non-
touch digital globes we do =ffer models closer to the $50k range; they are the same format/size, =ut have lower-
resolution projectors and don't include the =xpensive touch-control hardware/software. In either case, these globes 
=ome in 24", 30" and 36" sizes, and are mounted =n a pedestal-style orientation (the large projector sits underneath, 
=nside a metal cabinet). I have attached a photo below. For what it'= worth, these models are higher brightness than 
any other digital globe =n the market, so the image on the screen is bright and crisp, even when =sed in areas that have 
a decent amount of ambient light. (Poor =erformance in non-darkened environments is a common problem with other 
=rands of digital globes.) Our systems also feature control via tablet =r smartphone, which is also a feature unique to the 
Pufferfish line. =or globes larger than 36", we have many options, but I haven't =ncluded the details here since I assume 
these would be too big for your =ntended use. 
When it comes to more =ffordable options, we have two possibilities. One is our desktop-style =D globe. This 
system utilizes a special lens and a high-resolution =isplay. The lens, when coupled with our software, gives the effect of 
a =pherical globe sitting behind a piece of glass. You can digitally spin =nd tilt the globe in any direction to see a specific 
angle of the =arch, and you can play global animations and videos. Otherwise, we also =o custom hemispherical 
projection screens that mount on a wall and are =lluminated by an external projector. Because of the hemispherical 
shape =f the screen, and our proprietary display system, the effect is very =onvincing and most viewers think they are 
looking at a spherical globe. =oth of these options (desktop 3D or wall-mount hemisphere) can be =ontrolled by apps on 
an i Phone or iPad, and start at approximately =11,000. I have included pictures of both of these options below as =ell. 
I would be happy to schedule a =ollow-up call to discuss any of these products in more detail, =specially as it 
pertains to personal use. My direct line is 
, or you can let me know a good day/time to give you a =all. 
Thanks again for reaching out, 
Sincerely,
