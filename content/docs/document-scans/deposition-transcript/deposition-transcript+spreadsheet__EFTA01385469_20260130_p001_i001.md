Oxygen Furnaces (--75%) compared with EAFT's (--25%) 
For the year ended 2016 oxygen furnaces accounted for 75% of steelmaking 
processes globally versus EAF's, which made up 25%. China has -63% of the 
oxygen furnaces globally, comprising 95% of Chinese production. At 53% of 
its total output, India was the top EAF manufacturer in 2016, producing 55mn 
mt. The U.S. produced 52.6mn mt of steel through EAF's, or two-thirds of
