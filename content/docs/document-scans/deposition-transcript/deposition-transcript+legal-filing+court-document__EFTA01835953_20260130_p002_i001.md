advantageous tax structure for Jennie I need you to help me help you. Please note that at no time should you feel or 
think we are putting you at risk or jeopardizing you in any way. I respect and appreciate your position but need the two 
of us to have open lines of communication as many things are taking place or are on hold which may or may not have 
an impact on Jennies tax status. We clearly need your input and guidance on these matters. Further I believe a 
coordinated effort between Howard Lubcher, you and I should address any and all issues as they come up from time to 
time. I will attempt to address as many of the issues as I can in this e-mail and suggest we get on a call so I can 
address any questions or concerns you may have atter reading through the details. 
CORE: club Tax Returns 
Yes we are behind due to a variety of factors but this will get done within the next 120 days. I have help coming on 
board April 1 with the specific goal of accomplishing this first. If this timing somehow affects Jennie or you adversely 
please let me know. 
JS — Personal Guarantees 
Jennie has two personal guarantees: 
a.) BoA — S2.3M relating to a term loan which the club is paying back over a 7 year period. Jennie has a personal 
guarantee on this loan. To date the club has paid back approx S200k in principal. The guarantee remains in place until 
the loan is fully paid. The club began paying the term loan as of May 2010. The original line of credit issued June 
2005 was convened to a 7 year term loan at the end of 2009. 
b.) AES Loans — Jennie is a personal guarantor on loans in the amount of S7.5M issued by the co-owner and 
landlord. In July of 2010, the owner entity issued a letter at Jennie's request to conditionally release her from this 
guarantee. A copy of the letter is attached for your review; please refer to Page 2 items 1-5. Although Jennie is 
ultimately in control of most if not all these conditions I would like to understand your perspective and how this may 
impact my question to you below. 
I need to understand how you are using these guarantees (an up to what amount) as basis into the losses flowing to 
The Core Group Management LI.0 from TCC International LIE relative to Jennie's interest in the entity in order to 
reclaim payroll taxes on her earnings. Also how the delay in our filings may impact any taxes you have reclaimed to 
date. 
JS Estate Planning — Tax Structure 
In working with Howard Lubcher and Chad Yegclwel (attorney) we needed to come up with a tax structure that 
would allow Jennie to transfer her interest in TCGM to an entity while not adversely affecting control issues while 
allowing her to share her assets with her life partner. The attached outlines the proposed tax structure. Please feel free 
to comment on it as it relates to Jennie's overall tax status. We are in process of obtaining a waiver from the 
owner/landlord to move forward on this.
