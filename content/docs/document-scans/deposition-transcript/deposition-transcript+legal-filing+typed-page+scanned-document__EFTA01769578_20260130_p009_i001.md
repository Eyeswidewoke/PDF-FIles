Syrian activists an= rebels insist that the extremists are not welcome in communities that hav= long prided themselves 
on their tolerance of the religious minorities in =heir midst, including Christians, Alawites, Druze, Kurds and Ismaili 
Shiites. 
A rebel leader in n=rthern Syria who asked to be identified by his nom de guerre, Abu Mustafa,=described how he and 
his men drove out a group of about 15 radicals, all o= them Syrian but none of them local, who arrived in a northern 
village in January. Led by a commander who ident=fied himself as Abu Sulaiman, the group tried to recruit supporters for 
an=assault on the nearby town of Jisr al-Shughour. 
Abu Sulaiman "had=money, he had weapons, and he sent a guy to negotiate with me, but I refus=d," Abu Mustafa 
recalled in an interview in Turkey. "We asked him to l=ave, but he didn't, so we attacked him. We killed two of them, 
and one of our men was injured. Then he left, but I do='t know where he went." 
"The good thing i= that Syrians are against giving our country to radicals," Abu Mustafa a=ded. "But these groups have 
supporters who are very rich, and if our rev=lution continues like this, without hope and without result, they will gain 
influence on the ground." 
A largely secular r=volt 
There is a distinct=on between the naturally conservative religiosity of Syrians who come from=traditional communities 
and the radicalism of those associated with the gl=bal jihadi movement, said Joseph Holliday, who is researching the 
Free Syrian Army <http://www.understandingwar.orerepor=hyrias-armed-opposition> at the =nstitute for the Study of 
War in Washington and believes extremists are a small minority. 
"While there are =lements (in the opposition] that are very conservative, they are not the d=iving force," he said. "There 
is definitely an argument to be made tha= this will increase over time, because insurgencies often become more 
extremist over time, but for now the driving force behin= this revolution is secular." 
Adherents of the st=ict Salafi school of Islam have emerged in many Syrian communities and are=playing a role in the 
opposition, but they, too, are to be distinguished f=om the jihadis, said -Yezid Sayigh <http://carnegie-
mec.org/publications/?fa=47877> of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. 
"People who are l=cal and pious and moving in an Islamist direction and are taking up guns d=n't have the same 
organization and are not necessarily the same thing as=jihadists, who are not necessarily al-Qaeda," he said. - There's a 
range of different directions and trends." 
Many activists fear= however, that the influence of the extremists is growing as Syrian rebels=who have for months 
appealed in vain for Western military intervention loo= for help elsewhere. 
"Of course it is =rowing, because no one is doing anything to stop it," said a Syrian acti=ist who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity because he fears retribution f=om some of the radicals he has encountered while attempting to organize the 
opposition in many northern communities. =/span> 
"They have rules,=94 he said. "They say: If we give you money, you have to obey our orders=and accept our leadership. 
Some of my friends drink alcohol, and they aren=92t like this. But when they find no other way to cover their expenses, 
they join these groups and then they follow t=em."
