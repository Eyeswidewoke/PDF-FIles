As noted above, we have subpoenaed multiple airlines, but they no onger have

on commercial flights 
(beyond those on his private plane) during the earlier, relevant time periods. 
Corroboration on 
Witness Testimony 
Juan Alessi 
We have interviewed Juan Alessi, who worked as Epstein's house manager in Palm 
Beach from 1990 to 2002.5 When Alessi first began working for Epstein, he recalls that Epstein's 
girlfriend was Eva Anderson (now Eva Dubin), who he describes as having been pleasant and 
friendly. Alessi recalls that after Anderson and Epstein broke up, Epstein began dating Maxwell. 
In approximately 1993, Maxwell began coming to the house in Palm Beach, and became in charge 
of the whole house. Epstein told Alessi to go to Maxwell for his orders, and he began taking 
directions from Maxwell about house operations. Alessi described Maxwell as extremely difficult 
and unpleasant to work for. Although Alessi's previous interactions with Epstein were casual and 
informal in nature, he recalls that after Maxwell took over, the rules for house staff became strict. 
the environment became more formal, and work obligations increased. These trends slowly 
increased over the years, and Alessi recalls that the working environment changed more 
significantly in approximately 2000. At that point, Alessi was told that Epstein did not want to see 
workers in the same room with him; if Epstein entered a room, workers were required to 
immediately leave. Maxwell also told Alessi that he should not look Epstein in the eyes and should 
not speak to guests at the house. 
Alessi has a firm memory of seeing 
at Epstein's house. She made a 
strong impression because he remembers that srvas very young. very pretty. and a talented 
singer. He recalls Epstein telling him that Epstein was helping 
et her career started. 
Alessi remembers being sent by both Epstein and Maxwell to pick up 
from her house and 
drive her to Epstein's house, and he recalls thespecific neighborh 
ere 
lived. He 
si 
recalls Maxwell and Epstein spending time with 
at the Palm Beach house, and he also 
remembers being sent to buy movie tickets, and driving Maxwell, 
and Epstein to the 
movies. Although he has told us that nothing at the time alerted him tows 
going on between 
Epstein and 
behind closed doors, he does remember seeing Epstein kissing 
on the 
cheek and patting er bottom. 
Alessi's wife. Maria Alessi, also worked for Epstein part-time as housekeeper. We have 
interviewed Ms. Alessi and do not believe she has relevant information.
