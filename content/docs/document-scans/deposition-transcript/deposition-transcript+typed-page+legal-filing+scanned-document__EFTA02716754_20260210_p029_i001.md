record company. Frank Sinatra called Charles "the only true genius in show business", although Charles downplayed this 
notion. He =as blind from age seven. His best friend in music was South Carolina-born James Brown, the "Godfather of 
Sou=", and like Charles an active lifelong Republican. 
The influences upon his music were mainly jazz, blues, rhythm and blues, and country artists of the day including Art 
Tatum, Louis Jordan, Charles Brown, and Louis Armstrong, thou=h he maintained that he was most influenced by Nat 
King Cole. His playi=g reflected influences from country blues, barrelhouse and stride piano styles. Rolling Stone ranked 
Charles as number ten on its list of "100 Greatest Artists of All Time"= in 2004, and number two on their November 2008 
list of "100 Grea=est Singers of All Time". In honoring Charles, Billy Joel noted: "This may sound like sacrilege, but I think 
Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley". 
Charles possessed one of the most recognizable voices in American music. In the words of musicologist Sinatra, and 
Bing Crosby before him, had been masters of words. Ray Charles is a master of sounds. His records=disclose an 
extraordinary assortment of slurs, glides, turns, shrieks, wails, breaks, shouts, screams=and hollers, all wonderfully 
controlled, disciplined by inspired musicianship, =nd harnessed to ingenious subtleties of harmony, dynamics and 
rhythm... =t is either the singing of a man whose vocabulary is inadequate to express what is in his heart and mind or of 
one whose feelings are too intense for satisfactory verbal or conventionally melodic articulation. He can't tell it to you. 
He can't even sing it to you. He has to cry out to you, or shout to you, in tones eloquent of despair — or exaltation. The 
voi=e alone, with little assistance from the text or the notated music, conveys the message. 
In 1979, Charles was one of the first o= the Georgia State Music Hall of Fame to be recognized as a musician born in the 
state. =ay's version of "Georgia On My Mind" was made the off=cial state song for Georgia. In 1981, he was given a star 
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was one of the first inductees to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural 
ceremony in 1986. He rec=ived the Lifetime Achievement and the President's Merit Award, is a recipient of the 
Presidential Medal For the Arts, Kennedy Center Honors in 1986, Grammy Lifetime A=hievement Award in 1987 and 
France's Legion of Honor, r=ceived the NAACP Image Awards "Hall of Fame Award in 2004, =nd is one of the original 
inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
In 1991, he was inducted to the Rhyt=m & Blues Foundation. In 1993, he was awarded the National Meda= of Arts. In 
1998 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize to=ether with Ravi Shankar in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2004 he was inducted 
to the National Bl=ck Sports & Entertainment Hall of Fame. The Grammy Awards of 2005 were dedicated to Charles. He

Sing. In 2003, Charles was awarded an honorary degree by Dillard University. Upon his death, he endowe= a
