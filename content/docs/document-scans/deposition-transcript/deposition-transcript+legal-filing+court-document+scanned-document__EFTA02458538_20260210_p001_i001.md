Re: fields 
free floating probablity fields. 4>=A0 too woo--- probability . itself could enc=mpass what you are suggesting. be 
what you are looking for. why do t=ings tend toward the middle. why do red and tails eventually c=me up equally, ? 
if there are many many reds in a =ow, is it your " field" that is causing the next flips to =ost likely have more heads than 
tails. 
when soap bubblesQ=A0 form their shapes. in tha past it was believed it was due t= surface tension. not true, 
. it is du= to the fact that is the " most likely ( read , probable ) ensemble o= things . no more no less. 
I do not write =mails often so , sometimes they are a bit too short to be fully comprehens=ble to anyone but me. sorry . 
regarding the =ower laws. it is not All natural phenomeon but many, 4P=A0 zipfs law, continues to elude a derivation, 
though many have tri=d for years. but there is empirical data in wild =bundance. . creativity is part of the law, 
=C240 it says that the creative happens , and it happens only infreq=ently. . and out of the many creative things that 
do hap=en a smaller number get copied but the first ones to replicate often=form shape quicky . 
your fields 
could=C2* spring into existence quickly . 
I would ar=ue that a bell curve is the graphic representation of your field 
the=ry.

Dear Jeffrey, 
They could be probability fields thems=lves, you're right. When I first put forward this hypothesis I 
corresponded with Karl Popper, the philosopher of science, abo=t it and he thought morphic fields sounded like what he 
called propensity fie=ds, a very similar concept to your probability fields. The p=oblem is that when you propose this 
idea to people they just can't grasp the idea of free-floating prob=bility fields. They ask "What are they made of?" It's 
true that it's also ha=d to answer the question of what are quantum probability fields made of. </=pan> 
But there's a problem with trying to forc= all natural phenomena into the same shape of distribution that's 
come before. First of all, as with my own hypothesis, there's the problem of creativity: What about the first one? And 
secondly some probabilities are passive in the sense that they describe events that just happen, like coin tossing. Others 
are probability fields associated with self-organising systems, like developing plants. One kind of probability depends on 
external forces, the other on internal organisational principles.=C24,Morphic resonance only applied to the latter. <=u>
