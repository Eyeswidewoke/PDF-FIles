Getting Points 
We are changing the terms that concern the number of points that a 
Corporate Card Member earns per dollar of eligible spend (referred to in 
this paragraph as the "earn rate"). If you are a Corporate Card Member, 
effective March 6, 2020, your company will have the choice to determine 
if you earn one Membership Reward® point per dollar or one Membership 
Reward point per two dollars of eligible spend on your enrolled Card. 
Initially, your company will be able to select the earn rate until March 
31, 2020, which earn rate would be activated for you on May 1, 2020. 
Beginning in the fall of 2020, your company will be able to select the 
earn rate annually during the earn rate enrollment period in October and 
November of each year, which would be activated for you on January 1 of 
the following year. If your company does not make a selection during the 
annual enrollment period, then the earn rate will remain unchanged. If you 
are enrolled in the Membership Rewards Program you will be notified by 
American Express if your company decides to change the earn rate for its 
Corporate Card Program.
