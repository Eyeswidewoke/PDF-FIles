» =mportant for any crypto currency, the first one is that the network is =ig enough to prevent double-spending kind of 
attacks and the second one is that there's no way (I mean there is, but it's =ci-fi) to generate the private key for a 
random bitcoin identify/public =ey that is not yours. 
» A number of annoying things about bitcoin are: 
» 1) It's deflationary, not just because the amount of coins is finite 
» =ut also because people lose wallets/keys so potentially a lot of the 
» =ined coins will never see the light of the day 
» 2) You can create as many wallets/keys as you want, in theory this 
» =flows you to keep separate identities.. in practice this is not 
» =ntirely true 
» 3) A little known fact is that you can mess with the 
» =lockchain/ledger quite a lot, for instance somebody forced specific =alues into the ledger. For instance, these values 
could be virus =ignature, so antiviruses would quarantine/delete the blockchain from people =omputers. Not only that, 
but people have been storing all sort of stuff =nto the blockchain and it's permanent you cannot undo it.

» ok so here's what you do if you want to fix (1) and (2), I don't have 
» = good solution for (3) unless you change the power forces inside the 
» =etwork (eg: unless you allow a centralized unit to 'clean' the 
» =lockchain) 
» You create another crypto/alt currency that is inflationary so it =imics real money better, then you tell people: 
"everyone who has =itcoins can get them exchanged for this other currency". 
» The way this would work is that you actually require people to sign 
» =p for a *single* identify/key/wallet linked to their real identity 
» and =hen you do something called 'proof of burn', which in practice means =hat you tell people that to prove they 
'exchanged' their bitcoins they =eed to send them to a non-existent address (remember that it's =mpossible to generate 
the private key of a random bitcoin =ddress/public key, so nobody can ever claim those coins and they are lost forever). 
» On the top of that, since the bitcoin network is flexible you can use =hat blockchain to record the transactions of your 
own currency without =ny major issues (there are some technicalities involved but nothing =uch). 
» This brings to the last and probably hardest point which is: Why =eople would do it? 
» So some people do it already to get on board new currencies, so it's =ostly a speculation/ideology/belief. But if say 
you're a government, =ou can sweeten the deal saying something like "your holdings in =itcoins will not be taxed if 
moved to this other currency". 
» If you're not a govt then things are more complicated, but well.. 
» Anyway, this is in short how you go from bitcoin to another currency 
» =with the properties you care for) while preserving the bitcoin 
» network =nd its strengths. As I said, not sure if it's 
» useful/interesting but I =igured I'd share it 
» Another thing: any chance I can crash at your place in Santa Fe say
