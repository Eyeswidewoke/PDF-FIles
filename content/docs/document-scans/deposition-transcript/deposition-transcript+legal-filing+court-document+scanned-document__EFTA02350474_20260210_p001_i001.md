Thursday highlights: 
FIPE is due to release the third June preview of Sao Paulo's inflation index, and we expect 0.55%. 1BGE will release its 
employment report (PME) for May and we expect the unemployment rate to climb to 6.6% from 6.4% in April, reflecting 
the steep deceleration in job creation and deepening recession. The National Monetary Council (CMN) could decide on the 
TJLP rate for 3Q15. We expect the CMN to raise the TJLP by 50bps to 6.50%, repeating the previous two decisions, in 
line with the government's intention to curb subsidized lending. The CMN will also announce the inflation target for 2017, 
and although we expect the government to keep the 4.5% target, the local press has been discussing the possibility of a 
slight reduction in the target to 4.25%. or perhaps narrowing the tolerance band (currently plus or minus 2% around the 
center target), which would be a positive measure aimed at taming inflation expectations in our view. During the week, the 
government could release the federal tax receipts for May. and we expect BRL94bn, down from BRL I 09bn in April due to 
seasonal factors and also reflecting weak economic activity. 
Inflation Report suggests further monetary tightening, but not too much 
According to the quarterly Inflation Report published on Wednesday, the BCB's passive inflation forecast for 2015 
climbed to 9.0% from 7.9%. Despite the sharp increase in the 2015 forecast, the IPCA forecast for 2016 fell slightly to 
4.8% from 4.9% (we expected 4.7%). The "reference scenario" (passive forecast) now shows inflation converging to the 
4.5% target in 2Q17. These forecasts assumed an exchange rate of BRL3.10/1.1SD (vs. BRL3.15/USD in March) and a 
SELIC rate of 13.75% (vs. 12.75%) throughout the forecasting period. The BCB estimated administered price inflation of 
13.7% (vs. 11.0%) for 2015 and 5.3% for 2016. and revised its 2015 GDP forecast to -1.1% from -0.5%. In the "market 
scenario" based on macro parameters provided by the Focus survey (assuming a weaker FX and lower interest rates), the 
2015 forecast rose to 9.1% from 7.9%, the 2016 forecast was unchanged at 5.1%, and the 2Q17 forecast was 4.8%. 
As we expected, the Inflation Report indicated clearly that the tightening cycle is not over yet. On page 75, the authorities 
wrote that "for the COPOM. the progress obtained in the fight against inflation — as exemplified by the benign signals 
coming from the medium- and long-term expectations — are still insufficient." However, since the official forecasts are 
close to the target in 4Q16 and reach the target in 2Q17, we believe we the cycle is close to an end. While the BCB's 
assumption that the fiscal targets will be fully met in 2015 and 2016 are overly optimistic, in our view, the GDP 
contraction forecast of 1.1% is optimistic as well, and a wider output gap would make inflation converge to the target 
faster. Moreover, a decline in inflation expectations caused by the BCD's hawkish stance could also contribute to further 
lower the official inflation forecasts (as they are an input of the model). We also call attention to the Inflation Report's 
"box" on inflation persistence claiming that a shock in administered prices (which has been the main driver of inflation this 
year) is relatively short-lived, thus reinforcing the BCB's opinion that the current market consensus forecast of 5.5% 
inflation for 2016 is too high. 
All in all, we believe the BCB will deliver at least 50bps more, but no more than 75bps in hikes. We continue to expect a 
final 50bp hike in July. although we cannot rule out a scenario where the COPOM hikes by 50bps in July and finishes the 
cycle with a 25bp hike in September. Furthermore, the forecasts presented in the "market scenario" suggest that, once the 
BCB pauses, it will probably stay put for several months before cutting rates again. 
Business confidence in the industrial sector fell further in June 
According to preliminary data released by FGV, its business confidence index fell 4.7% MoM to 68.2 in May, reaching an 
all-time low. The current conditions index fell 5.4% to 70.6, and the expectations index fell 4.2% to 65.8. Capacity 
utilization fell further to 78.7% from 79.0%, the lowest level since April 2009. In our opinion, given the overall 
deterioration in this year's economic outlook, expectations of negative GDP growth, and turbulent political environment, 
business confidence will remain depressed for a while despite the potentially positive effect of the FX depreciation.
