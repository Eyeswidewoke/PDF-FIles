the July 25 phone call in which Trump prodded his Ukrainian 
counterpart to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden." 
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman testified before the House 
Intelligence Committee today that Trump's call with Ukrainian 
President Zelensky was Improper" and he considered it his 
"duty to pass along his concerns. However, the AP (11/19, 
Mascaro, Jalonick) says Republicans on the panel "tried to 
undercut the national security official with pointed exchanges 
questioning his loyalty: The AP also says Vindman "deflected 
repeated Republican efforts to divulge everyone he told about 
it — thwarting Trump allies' attempts to identify the 
anonymous whistleblower who spurred the impeachment 
probe." 
Politico (11/19, Bertrand, Forgey, Marshall, 4.29M) 
reports that Vindman 'explained that he had already 'alerted' 
White House lawyer John Eisenberg to Gordon Sondland's 
push for political investigations during a July 10 meeting at 
the White House with Ukrainian officials, and that subsequent 
to reporting the contents of that meeting to Eisenberg he was 
'invited to follow up with any other concerns.- Politico adds, 
"So he reported Trump's July 25 comments to Eisenberg 
'without hesitation,' he testified.-
The New York Times (11/19, Hakim, 18.61M) reports 
that "because [Vindman] was a key point of contact with 
Ukrainian officials, they sought his guidance on" Rudy 
Giuliani's "efforts to push the investigations." According to the 
Times, Vindman, "reflecting the National Security Council's 
policy...advised Ukrainian officials, including Mr. Zelensky, to 
steer clear of American politics." 
The AP (11/19, Mascaro, Jalonick) says the 
Republicans' lead counsel "asked at one point about an offer 
to Vindman from a Ukrainian official to become the country's 
defense minister." According to the AP, Vindman "called it 
'comical' and said he swiftly reported it up his chain of 
command." Politico (11/19, Bertrand, Forgey, Marshall, 
4.29M) reports that Vindman 'testified that Alexander 
Danyliuk, Zelensky's national security adviser, on at least 
three occasions offered him the role of Ukrainian defense 
minister." Bloomberg (11/19, 4.73M) reports that Danyiyuk 
said today that 'the suggestion 'was made in joking manner, 
which was clear by the context and tone,"' and "added that is 
was also clear that Vindman took it as a joke." 
Reuters (11/19, Zengerle, Freifeld, Landay) reports that 
"even as he was testifying, the White House's official Twitter 
account attacked [Vindman's] judgment — even though he is a 
current White House official, and the president's son Donald 
Trump Jr. assailed him in a separate Twitter post as 'a low 
level partisan bureaucrat and nothing more." 
Pence's National Security Adviser: Williams Never 
Voiced Concerns About Trump-Zelensky Call. Politico 
(11/19, Desiderio, Cheney, 4.29M) reports that Jennifer 
Williams, an adviser to Vice President Pence described the 
Trump-Zelensky phone call as "unusual" because it 'involved 
discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political 
matter,' rather than U.S. foreign policy goals in the region. 
The references to Biden 'struck me as political in nature given 
that the former vice president is a political opponent of the 
president,' Williams said, but she declined to speculate about 
Trump's motives." 
Bloomberg (11/19, 4.73M) reports that Keith Kellogg, 
Pence's national security adviser, "said in a statement 
Tuesday that he listened to Trump's July 25 phone call 
with...Zelenskiy and that he 'heard nothing wrong or 
improper.'" Bloomberg says Kellogg issued the statement 
after Williams testified that she "didn't inform him of any 
concerns after the call." Kellog said, "In fact, she never 
reported any personal or professional concerns to any other 
member of the vice president's staff, including our chief of 
staff and the vice president." 
The New York Times (11/19, Baker, Shear, 18.61M) 
reports that Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, "went on Fox 
News to make the same point. 'She said she found the call 
unusual yet she never raised any concerns with her 
supervisor General Kellogg, she never raised any concerns 
with the chief of staff, she never raised any concerns with the 
vice president,' he said." 
In a profile of Williams published before her appearance 
today, the New York Times (11/19, Shear, 18.61M) says 
Democrats are "interested in what Mr. Pence knew about the 
effort to withhold security aid in exchange for a commitment 
to investigate the Bidens." According to the Times, 'During 
the closed-door deposition, Ms. Williams told lawmakers that 
she was not aware that the vice president was involved in any 
discussions about the investigations. She said Mr. Pence did 
not mention investigations to Mr. Zelensky." 
Morrison: Trump-Zelensky Call Included Nothing 
Illegal. The New York Times (11/19, Baker, Shear, 18.61M) 
reports that Timothy Morrison, the former senior director for 
Europe and Ukraine at the National Security Council, "said he 
did not think the president's July 25 call...was inherently 
wrong or illegal, but feared it would ignite a political storm if it 
became public." Morrison is quoted as saying, "I feared at the 
time of the call on July 25 how its disclosure would play in 
Washington's dimate. ... My fears have been realized." 
Volker Says He Misunderstood Import Of Push For 
Burisma Probe. The Washington Post (11/19, Wagner, 
Itkowit, 14.2M) reports that Kurt Volker, a former envoy to 
Ukraine, testified before the House Intelligence Committee 
today that he "should have realized President Trump's true 
motives in demanding that Ukraine investigate Burisma, a 
natural gas company that employed former vice president 
Joe Biden's son Hunter." Volker is quoted as saying, "I did not 
understand that others believed that an investigation of the 
Ukrainian company Burisma, which had a history of 
accusations of corruption, was tantamount to investigating 
Vice President Biden. I drew a sharp distinction between the 
two: However, the Post says Volker's testimony is "belied by 
text messages that he tumed over to the House Intelligence
