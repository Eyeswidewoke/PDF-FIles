The brain tends to respond to new experiences in certain stereotyped ways. The prior responses to experiences determine 
response to new experience. There is a tendency for operational patterns to rigidify, inhibiting the acquisition of new 
experience. All coding, all neural imprinting, takes place in the present. The operational imprint can be said to be a measure of 
information, the adaptive change. This imprinting is continually happening. Man was never aware of it; he was never asked to 
give, and never gave, his consent to it. There was, there is, no choice. 
The most important feature of the age of electric technology is the moving of information. This is not to be confused with 
words, images. It has to do with control, with the extension of the central nervous system outside the body, into the world as 
the world. New technologies effected a change in the operation of the brain. Telephone companies, electric companies, 
construction companies, hardware manufacturers, etc., were all in the same business: moving information. Telephone 
companies based charges on time; electricity companies charged for power; television manufacturers charged for a product. 
None of them based charges on information, on the evolutionary effect of their products and services upon mankind. 
Electricity is the unitive factor that can make all brains in the world perform the same operations simultaneously. Through 
electronic technology, millions upon millions of brains can act on the same information at the same time. Information is a 
measure of a change in the brainaTMs activity, a frequency modulation. Every brain working the same way, on the same 
frequency, the same wave length, performing the same operations simultaneously. Not brotherhood, but unity. 
The past is illusion. ficeThe future is notis It is even necessary to stop talking of the present, which implies other aspects of 
the abstraction of time. Time, which cannot be directly experienced. Time, which does not exist in the neural world. 
Considerations of the interpretation of the ordering of the brainaTMs experience pertain to the world of the past. The past is 
illusion. There is no sequence. There is no specific causation. There is only the ordering and arrangement of the experience of 
the brain in a universe of simultaneous operations. The past is illusion. Sequence is simultaneity. 
The brain is a terminal machine in the process that is itself the dynamic, the reference point. This reference point is not to be 
found as a substantial basis, but in considerations of function and operations. It will be found in the process of transmission of 
neural pattern. It is through observation of operations, measurement of information, that this dynamic situation can be dealt 
with. Observation and measurement, not classification and categorization. 
The brain is constantly synchronizing with new rhythms. As such it programs itself as a self-organizing system called 
evolution. This constant transaction with new rhythms and the ordering process is the level to which attention should now be 
applied. Not sex, not unconscious urges, not iconic archetypes, not metaphysics. There is no purpose. There are no goals. 
Man always valued his identity, but knowing who he was proved only to tell him what had already happened. People are no 
longer important or worthy of any consideration. Man is dead. No more people, with their loves, fears, longings. it has been 
said that Acta man thinks he amounts to a great deal, but to a mosquito he is only something good to eat.a$6 Do not recognize 
peopleaTMs feelings. Human feelings do not exist. Respect no one. People do not exist. No more dreams, no more illusion. 
fie am in love.a The neural impulse does not necessarily bear relationship to the sensory stimulus. Stereotyped neural 
programs can be activated in any number of different situations. awl am in love.ii Faces, bodies change but the same love 
remains, the same feeling. Such stereotyped programs are established by prior experience which both encodes and rigidifies 
the operant activities of the brain, delimiting the range of potential responses. &el am in lovelt All pleasures, all love exist in
