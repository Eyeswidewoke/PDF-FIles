Credits: 0 am 6759 Sec A 
In this course. we'll delve into a range of approaches to fundamental questions raised by the 
theory that in the work of making, designers draw on 'tacit knowledge' a things known, but not 
articulated. by the knower. What are the implications of tacit knowledge, and tacit beliefs, for 
design that seeks to make and change the world(s) in which we live? And what are the impacts on 
design when these tacit Ideas are about structures of race, class. gender, sexuality, ability and 
nation, or what Ruth Wilson Gilmore. a professor of geography. calls the fatal coupling of power 
and difference"? Working through perspectives of both designers and 'non-designers; this course 
will examine the social and political locations u and the tacit and explicit ideas that shape them 
of designed objects and systems, as well as collaborative and participatory design processes and 
ways of working. We will use the emerging context of 'social design."social innovation; and 
'design for change,' In which designers from a range of fields are working locally and 
internationally to utilize design processes and create artifacts and systems intended to address 
serious social, ecological, and economic matters, as a framework, asking how differences In 
stakeholders' ideas about what constitutes design 'problems' and 'solutions' in these projects 
might both limit and expand capacities for design. The course. appropriate for anyone who makes 
or uses designed things and systems. will draw on key analyses of contemporary and historical 
relationships of power and cultural meanings, including Cultural Studies, Queer and Feminist 
Theory, Critical Prison Studies, and Visual Cultural and Design Studies, to help interpret and think 
through these questions.<div>Students must register for both the lecture and discussion section
