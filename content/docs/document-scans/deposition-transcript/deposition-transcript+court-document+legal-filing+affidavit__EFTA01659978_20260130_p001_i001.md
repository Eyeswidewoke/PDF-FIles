Subject: Issue raised by Epstein's defense team 
Date: Wed, 19 Dec 2007 17:55:37 +0000 
Importance: Normal 
On Friday, Mr. Epstein's defense team argued for the first time that the state charge contained in the Non-
Prosecution Agreement does not apply to the facts of his case. As an ethical matter, the Office does not want a 
defendant to plead guilty to a crime that he did not commit; however, we are not experts in the interpretation of 
the Florida Criminal Code, so we look to you for guidance. To assist, I have listed the statute below and 
summarize the arguments of Mr. Epstein's attorneys. I also have included the factual proffer that Ms. 
requested so you can determine whether, in your opinion, there is a sufficient factual basis for a plea. 
Fl. Stat. 796.03 states: "A person who procures for prostitution, or causes to be prostituted, any person who is 
under the age of 18 years commits a felony of the second degree . . ." 
Fl. Stat. 777.011 states: "Whoever commits any criminal offense against the state, whether felony or 
misdemeanor, or aids, abets, counsels, hires, or otherwise procures such offense to be committed, and such 
offense is committed or is attempted to be committed, is a principal in the first degree and may be charged, 
convicted, and punished as such, whether he or she is or is not actually or constructively present at the 
commission of such offense." 
Mr. Epstein's counsel state that Section 796.03 applies only to procuring a minor to engage in a sex act with a 
third party, not with the defendant himself, relying on Kobel v. State, 745 So.2d 979, 982 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999), 
and Register v. State, 715 So.2d 274, 278 (Fla. 1st DCA 1998). They also assert that a commercial motive must 
be shown. 
Please consider whether the following facts are sufficient to prove a violation of Section 796.03, when read in 
conjunction with Section 777.011: 
From at least as early as 2001 through October 2005, the defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, procured at 
least 30 identified minor females between the ages of 14 and 17 in Palm Beach County to come to 
his home in Palm Beach to engage in sexual conduct in exchange for money. In particular, the 
defendant would pay females, including minors, $200 to recruit other females, including minors, to 
come to his house to engage in sexual activity. The minors who were procured would receive 
between $200 and $1,000 depending upon the type of sexual activity that they engaged in. Several 
victims have stated that, when they were unwilling to engage in sexual activity with the defendant, 
the defendant would ask them to bring other girls instead, and promised to pay them $200 for each 
girl whom they brought. Mr. Epstein would regularly ask his recruiters to find new girls for him 
because he wanted "fresh faces." 
In some instances, the defendant did not know the correct age of the minor female who was 
procured as a prostitute, but in more than half of the instances he did. For example, the defendant 
purchased gifts for some girls for their 18th birthdays, promised to send them on trips when they 
turned 18, talked with them about activities at their high schools; and provided transportation for 
those who could not drive.
