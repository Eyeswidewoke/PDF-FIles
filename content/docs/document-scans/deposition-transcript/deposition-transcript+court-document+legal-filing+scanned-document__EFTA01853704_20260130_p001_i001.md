I told Rich and Darren that I received a phone call from one of the pilots late this aftemoon that where going 
to fly with me on the Africa trip today. Bruce Jardja and Jim Bartowski where the two gentlemen that flew to 
Palm Beach from San Diego and Minnesota respectively to fly on the Boeing with me, (extremely 
personable guys, we spent all day Tuesday together). Both pilots are contract pilots for Dave Tokoph who is 
the main connection and personal friend of the President of Ivory Coast in this deal. (I was told that Tokoph 
is a child hood friend of the President and handles all the African aviation for him, also Tokoph owns two 
airlines in Africa and is a fan of the B727,. FYI. 
Jim Bartowski (pilot) is in direct contact with Dave Tokoph, Jim asked me to inform him if and when we are 
able to get insurance and he would pass the message directly to Tokoph„ according to Jim, Dave Tokoph is 
unhappy with the replacement aircraft they are using for the trip (17 seats, short range, very UN-Presidential 
for a United Nations visit, etc), he thought we could pick up this trip from Paris next week and fly the 
President to Newark for the UN portion of the trip, then fly to Africa. Long shot, but at least I have a means 
of direct contact with Tokoph., 
I did speak to Dave Tokoph on Tuesday when we where waiting for insurance approvals, and we discussed 
fueling and flight planning. 
I know its a long shot, whether we can acquire insurance with Rich Demmicco, since he prefers me to 
present our charter deal in person with Global in New Jersey next week. I have met with Global several 
years ago when the Boeing was in Newark and gave Joe Rosenthal, Rich Demmicco and Globals team a 
tour of the Boeing and explained our operation. They where impress, this is why Demmicco is lobbying to put 
this meeting together again,. seams silly to go through this step, since timing is important. just keeping you 
updated,. 
thank you, 
Larry
