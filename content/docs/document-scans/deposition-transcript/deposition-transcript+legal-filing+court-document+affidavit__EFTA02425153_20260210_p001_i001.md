Yes, so have I. I am glad this has come to the fore, it has been a point of contention in me for 
years and it needs to be finally resolved so we can move past it without misunderstandings. 
this isn't about me expecting you to pay for me forever, i am not lazy. it is simply that i equate the 
time and energy and intention of us, and i take a look around me and note what i see. 
i am aware of my shortcomings and the places i screwed up, my goodness i am, and no matter 
how it looks, i take responsibility for those. there was always something in you with me jeffrey 
that was running away. from the beginning 
your life wasn't set up for me to be a real player in it. and I stand firm against the accusation that i 
couldn't have been that for you, i think you and i could have built an extrodinary life together. 
alas life has scurried forward, and here we are, i engage with you, without expectation, working 
with you on the island helps make sense of a huge part of my past, and my hope is that if we can 
get through this journey fine and well and without complication we can be lasting and meaningful 
friends.

I thought long and hard about our conversation this morning.. I do not want to 
have a repeat of our past misunderstandings. mistress , girlfriend„ either title. 
unlike 99% of men I know after our relationship broke, due in large part to your 
outragious behavior. you continued to receieve generousity from me. most men in 
similar circumstances never would have given you a dime. not a dime.. you failed 
repeatedly to live up to our agreements , continued on a path of your own making, 
violated almost every rule we ever agreed, and then look back , without accepting 
repsonsibility for your actions. and think , buy I got shortchanged. You cannot 
continue to beleive that no matter what you do, no matter how you behave you 
deserve to be finacilay supported. that is not the real world.. you find yourself in 
this crazy predicament soley becauase you have not done a good job, and lived up 
to your obligations. soley.. it is easy to blame others. your expecations of what 
your should get for what you do , is out of whack, I am sorry. hjowever you have 
been very responsiboel with Robert. I want there to be no misunderstandings. I 
appreciate what you are doing. I have repeatedly been there foryou. what i hear 
from you is that He /she . didn;t keep their word . this is over and over, . LEts talk 
tomorrow.
