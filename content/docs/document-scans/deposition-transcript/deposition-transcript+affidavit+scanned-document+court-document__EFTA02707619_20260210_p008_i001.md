Review of $150 mil Life Insurance purchased through Bryant Group 
Rationale for the $50mi1 life insurance policy on Leon: 
Proceeds would be available at time of death to pay off some of indebtedness related to 
your art collection 
Rationale for the second-to-die policy on Debra and Leon: 
Proceeds would be available at time of death to pay estate taxes 
These policies are owned in irrevocable life insurance trusts (the Leon D Black Insurance 
Trusts #1 and #2). The policies purchased were set up in a split-dollar structure to 
minimize gift tax. The split-dollar entity, AIF IV Management Inc (now part of BFP), 
advances the annual premiums (in lieu of compensation to Leon). Fortunately, these 
variable universal life policies were purchased from top carriers who have fared relatively 
well in the recent financial crisis. Investments in various mutual funds were elected at the 
time of the purchase of the policies by John Hannan. The goal in a structure like this is to 
have the policy assets invested in a way that they will appreciate enough to have 
sufficient equity to allow for a cash withdrawal to both repay premiums previously 
advanced by the split dollar entity(at which point the split $ arrangement is terminated) 
and cover premiums going forward. The death benefit, when ultimately paid to the Trust, 
is income tax-free and estate tax free. In 2009, you paid gift tax on a reportable income 
and gift of $90,639 compared with the full amount of $1.8 mil of premiums paid annually 
which would otherwise have been considered gifts to the trusts. 
These policies were initiated in September 1999. You have paid in $19.5 mil in premiums 
(shown in the `split-dollar advance' column on the attached 12/31/09 Summary of 
Coverage). The cash surrender value (which is tied to the underlying value of the assets 
invested) was valued at $14.2 mil at 12/31/09. This reflects a difficult decade for stocks 
generally. Also, the investment options chosen were heavily growth oriented. Think back 
to 1999 in the midst of the tech bubble in the making. At that time growth was the only 
thing working and the only thing people wanted to own. The other side of the bubble 
ie.2000-2002 was quite painful. In the period 1/1/00-12/31/09 the Russell 1000 Growth 
index declined 33% cumulatively. The original options have not been revised or 
rebalanced along the way. While in the currently slow growing economy growth style 
portfolios are likely to do well, I have a review of the funds owned on my to-do list and 
will work to add some international options and rebalance a bit from the existing funds. 
Whereas the original plan called for an equity build in the underlying assets that 
would have allowed premium recovery to begin next year, it looks as though we face 
another decade of premium payments before we begin that process. Assuming an 
average return of 9%, it will be 2020 before we get to the point of the premium advances 
being covered. The death benefits are fully intact at the $150 mil face value of the 
policies and will service their intended purposes. The terms of the structure stipulate that 
if the needed equity appreciation is not achieved before the death of the insured, the 
repayment of premiums advanced by the split-dollar entity is paid from the death benefit.
