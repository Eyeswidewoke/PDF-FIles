racketeering, six counts of bribery, five counts of money laundering, and one count each of 
structuring cash deposits to conceal bribes, making a false statement to a financial institution, 
making false statements to federal law enforcement, and tax evasion." 
City News Service (CA) (8/3) reports that Huizar "was stripped of all his committee 
assignments in November 2018, following FBI searches of his home and offices, and had scaled 
back his legislative activity before his suspension. During the search of his home, agents seized 
$129,000 in cash that was stashed in Huizar's closet and which, according to the indictment, he 
received from a Chinese billionaire and another businessperson seeking favors from him."
