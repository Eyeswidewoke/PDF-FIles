NES, LLC, Plan D, LLC 
We need your inputs on the points highlighted in red. 
Case #: 
Relationship: SOUTHERN FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP Customer Name: The 2007 Jeffrey E. Epstein Insurance Trust #3 
Customer Number: 
Reason for Rejection:10/19/2018 - Rejection Points: 
1. 
Please provide evidence of or a case comment regarding confirmation from the client that the information on 
the KYC is still accurate (i.e. ownership structure, signatories, etc. have not changed). The comment must include the 
name of the person spoken with and date this conversation occurred. (The attached internal email does not meet this 
requirement.) — Have attached the no material confirmation received by you for your reference, however we need 
more info as per the rejection point. 
Darren indyke - PE22/18 confirmed that there are no material changes 
3. Andrew Gallivan's approval is not dated on the KYC. — Please advise Andrew Gallivan to input the approval date in 
the case. 
a. 
5. The nature of business narrative for NES LLC states the entity was formed to take care of the expenses 
associated with running one of Jeffrey's homes. However, the KYC states the purpose of its DDA account is to pay for 
costs associated with Jeffrey's airplanes. Please review and ensure that information is consistent. I had taken the nature 
of business from the customer page of NES LLC which states "NES, 1.14C was formed to take care of the expenses 
associated with running one of Jeffrey Epstein's homes" and the purpose of the account that you had provided 
states "This is a simple checking account for pay for costs associated for Jeffrey Epstein's airplanes'. Please assist us as this 
seems to be inconsistent by the checker. 
Correction - NES. LLC was formed to take care of the expenses associated with running Jeffrey Epsiein's NY home 
6. The Haze Trust: 
f. Brokerage account: The signatories identified on the KYC are not consistent with the parties listed in NetX. 
Darren is the only individual tagged as a signatory on the KYC. Please ensure that the KYC is updated to include all 
authorized parties for the brokerage account and required information and documentation (including research). — Kindly 
provide this as we do not have access to NetX. 
Sec attached account resolutions:

11. Plan D LLC: 
b. Nature of business: Please confirm. Equipment rental/leasing is listed as the industry for this entity on the 
Dunn & Bradstreet report (within the due diligence searches). If this is accurate, the KYC should reflect this information. 
— We need your assistance on the accuracy on Customer page of Plan D LLC mentions "LLC created to hold funds to 
pay for costs associated with one of Jeffrey Epstein's planes" and search states "Equipment rental/leasing" in the SIC 
codes (research Is attached for your quick reference)
