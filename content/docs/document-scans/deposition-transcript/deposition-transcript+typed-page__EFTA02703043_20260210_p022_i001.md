Donaldson Toussaint L'Ouverture Byrd II (December 9, 1932 — =ebruary 4, 2013) was an American jazz and rhythm and 
blues trumpeter. A sideman for many other jazz music=ans of his generation, Byrd was best known as one of the only 
bebop jazz musicians who successfully pioneered the funk and soul genres while simultaneously remain=ng a jazz artist. 
He recorded prolifically as both a leader and sideman from the mid -'50s into the mid-'60s, m=st often for Blue Note, 
where he established a reputation as a solid stylist with a clean tone, clear articulation, and a knack for melodicism. 
Toward th= end of the '60s, Byrd became fascinated with Miles Davis' move into fusion, and started recording hi= own 
forays into the field. In the early '70s, with the help of brothers Lar=y and Fonce Mizell, Byrd perfected a bright, breezy, 
commercially potent take on fusion that was distinct from Davis, incorporating tighter arrangements and more of a 
smooth soul influence.t>=A0 As a bandleader, Byrd is also notable for his influential role in the early career of renowned 
keyboard player and compos=r Herbie Hancock. 
Byrd was born in Detroit, Michigan. His father, a Met=odist minister, was an amateur musician, and Byrd was already an 
accomplished trumpeter by the time he finished high school having performed with Lionel =ampton. After playing in a 
military band during a term in the United States Air For=e, he obtained a bachelor's degree in music from Wayne State 
University an= a master's degree from Manhattan School of Music. While still at the Manhattan School, he joined Art 
Blakey's Jazz Messengers, as replacement for Clifford Brown. In 1955, he recorded with Gigi Gryce Jackie McLean and 
Mal Waldron. After leaving the Jazz Messengers in 1956, he performed with many leading j=zz musicians of the day, 
including John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Mo=k, and later Herbie Hancock. Byrd's first regular group was a 
quintet that he co-led from 1958-61 with barito=e saxophonist Pepper Adams, an ensemble whose hard-driving 
performances are captured "live" on At the Half Note Cafe. 
In the mid-'60s, Byrd focused more of his energie= on teaching, and worked diligently to make jazz and its history a 
legitimate p=rt of the college curriculum. He taught at Rutgers, Hampton, New York Universi=y, and Howard in the late 
'60s, and the last one remained a steady associa=ion for much of the '70s. In the meantime, Byrd continued to record 
occasionall=, cutting a final spate of hard bop albums over 1966-1967 that included and Blackjack. Byrd also began to 
study African music, inspired partly by the emerging black-consciousness movement, and became interested in Miles 
Davis' efforts to woo a younger audience (includ=ng Byrd's own students) by experimenting with electronics and funk 
rhythms. Released in 1969, Fancy Free found Byrd using electric piano for the first time, with a spacy sound that 
recalled Davis' In a Silent Way. Issued in 1970, Electric Byrd had=more of a Bitches Brew flavor, and the jams on 1971's 
Ethiopian Knights=/b> were longer, funkier, and more aggressive. Byrd truly came into his own as a fus=on artist when 
he hooked up with the Mizell brothers, who began to handle production, writing, and some musical support duties. 
Their first collabora=ion was 1972's Black Byrd, an upbeat, funky blend of jazz and=R&B. 
As a side note to his musical career, Byrd finished l=w school in 1976, and went on to teach at North Carolina Central 
University. 1= 1982, Byrd received his Ph.D. from Columbia Teachers College and thentaught at a variety of 
postsecondary institutions, including Rutgers University, the Hampton Institute, New York University, Howard University, 
Queens College, Oberlin College, Cornell University, North Carolina Central University, North Texas State and Delawa=e 
State University. Byrd returned to somewhat straight-ahead jazz later in his career, releasing three albums fo= Orrin 
Keepnews' Landmark Records, and his final album Touchstone, a qui=tet. In the late '80s and early '90s, Byrd returned
