with regard to 2004-2005 time period, but you are saying 
2 
at least it's right with regard to the number of times 
3 
you went; is that correct? 
4 
A. I said I don't remember the exact dates and 
5 
years. 
6 
Q. Well, if it's 2004 and 2005, it would be at 
7 
the end of your junior year, latter part of your junior 
8 
year into your senior year, correct? 
9 
A. Yes. 
10 
Q. All right. So, and I thought you told me five 
11 
minutes ago that that time period was not correct, or 
12 
now you are not so sure again.

MR. HOROWITZ: Form. 
14 
THE WITNESS: I told you that I didn't 
15 
remember the dates. And I do remember going there 
16 
from eight to ten times, but I don't icumnbei the 
17 
exact dates of when I started going there.

BY MR. CRITTON: 
19 
Q. Okay. That's my question to you is you don't 
20 
remember the exact dates, but at least that part of the 
21 
interrogatory where it says the number of times you 
22 
went, you think that's maybe accurate? 
23 
A. Yes, it is accurate. 
24 
Q. Eight to ten times, okay. Well, you told the 
25 
police, the Palm Beach Police Department when you were

Q. The first time you went, you went with H.R., 
right? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Let me get back to my question. They seemed 
to know that you were at Mr. Epstein's home, that is, 
the police officers? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Because they had seen your car there? 
A. Yes. 
Q. All right. And so if your car was there, I 
assume you don't let other people drive your car 
generally? 
Let me ask this question. Did you ever let 
any other person drive your car to Mr. Epstein's home? 
A. No. 
Q. Okay. So you in each of those instances would 
have had to make the voluntary decision that you were 
going to go to Mr. Epstein's home, right? 
A. Yes. 
Q. All right. So you told them on the first 
occasion you went with H.R., right? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And what did you tell them who H.R. was? 
A. She was a friend in high school. 
Q. All right. So you went with H.R. She was a 
Page 59

interviewed that you only went two times, didn't you? 
2 
A. Yes, I already admitted that I did not tell 
3 
them the whole truth. 
4 
Q. I know. Well, what I'm trying to do is figure 
5 
out how many things you told them that may have been 
6 
true, that is -- well, let me strike that. 
7 
I'm trying to find out now from looking at the 
8 
police report what you told them may have been true 
9 
versus what was not true or might be a half truth or 
10 
something that you omitted. That's what I'm trying to 
11 
do here, okay? 
12 
A. Okay. 
13 
Q. Do you understand that? 
14 
A. Yes. 
15 
Q. All right. So we know it's your testimony now 
16 
that you lied to them about your age. Did you lie to 
17 
them about the number of times you went to Mr. Epstein's 
18 
home, they being the Palm Beach Police Department? 
19 
A. I told you I didn't tell them all the times I 
20 
went. I only told them two. 
21 
Q. Well, you told them you went only two times? 
22 
A. Yes. 
23 
Q. Is that a lie? 
24 
A. I told you yes. I told you at the very

friend. She was a good friend at the time? 
A. I don't remember if she was a good friend. I 
think we were fighting. Me and her like would fight a 
lot and then make up. So I don't remember if we were 
good friends at the time or just friends. 
Q. Okay. Good friend is someone you trust, have 
with your 
but
name
 would you consi 
a g 
someone that you would feel very comfortable with and 
you could trust? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Okay. And if it was just a friend, maybe you 
would trust and maybe you wouldn't? 
A. Yes. 
Q. So you go with H.R., who you have now 
described as a friend, someone you might trust or not 
trust, right? 
A. Yes. 
Q. To Mr. Epstein's home. Again, I'm going to 
get into details later. 
So you go to Mr. Epstein's home the first 
time, and what happens, or what did you tell the police, 
your best recollection? 
A. I just remember I told them that I went there 
and I saw the cooks there, I sat
