Re: Allegations 
Justin is not ideal, but given the current situation I =elieve it is necessary to have someone advising me with more 
knowledge =f rights and procedures. THey seem to flying by the seat of their pants =ere, and will need to establish what 
is proper... While I am sure he =ould like to be at the first meeting, I don't want that, but I =hink he could prepare me 
better for that meeting. I am going to =mail her with some more questions indeed.. will be peppering her =ith 
questions both before and during and after the meeting.. 
More later.

Well, this came in today, and this clarifies =ome things.. Particulary it is clear that this office is not really 
=ollowing any procedure and isn't out to deal with me in a =ay that respects my rights. (no surprise to you!). 
Statements =ike "include, but not limited to"? What the fuck =s that? Also, it seems clear that from the list of =E2 
allegations' (and note they don't explain which =nes they are actually investigating), that the list is basically the =uzzfeed 
article.. so indeed they are not restricting themselves in at =east listing just university related ones (items 4 and 5.. and 
re 5, =hat the fuck? Who the fuck cares what an employee thinks about a =onor?) 
Anyway, =t is clear to nancy and I that we need to bring Justin in, at least as =n advisor before I have my 
meeting next tues.. I was going to consider =ringing him in depending upon what I heard there, but based on this, =here 
are various jurisdictional issues, and respecting my rights issues =hat I need to be guided on. (I plan to ask specific 
=uestions now during the meetings next tues, but not give responses at =he time). 
So, at this point I plan to write to her to ask her for some =pecifics (which I don't expect her to agree to 
answer till we =eet, but we will see), and contact Justin to let him know I will pay =is retainer. I don't want him 
accompanying me to the =eeting on Tues, but I want to plug him in the loop with me, and help me =now what to ask, 
and how to be prepared to respond....
