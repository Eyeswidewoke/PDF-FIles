principal of the Fund, and actively participated in the marketing, management and 
operations of the Fund. In fact, the Fund originally operated out of offices located at 
HCM's headquarters in New York City and used HCM's personnel to provide, among 
other things, administrative support. ( REFERENCE THE SEC DEFICEINCY LETTER 
?>)In 2004, the Fund moved its offices and transferred its administrative functions to a 
separate location in New York City.

Among other things, Dubin brought early investors to the Fund. Jeffrey Epstein was one 
of the Fund's earliest investors. Over the next couple of years, Epstein's wholly-owned 
corporation, Financial Trust Company, Inc. ("FTC"), became one of the largest retail 
investors in the Fund. FTC made a series of large capital contributions to the Fund 
totaling $80 million between 2002 and 2005. Dubin was Epstein's primary contact at the 
Fund and because of what I understood to be the long-standing personal and business 
relationship between Dubin and Epstein, I consulted with Dubin on mostly all matters 
relating to FTC.

In the Fall of 2004, the Fund determined to increase the rolling "lock-up period" for Fund 
investments from two years to three years. The change was to be effective for 
investments in the Fund made as of January I, 2005 and thereafter, while investments 
made prior to that time were to remain subject to the original rolling two-year lock-up 
period. 
9. 
In December 2004, FTC was contemplating making an additional capital contribution to 
the Fund in the amount of $20 million. This investment would be effective on January 1, 
2005. However, FTC desired that a single rolling lock-up period of two-years apply to 
the total aggregate investment made by FTC from 2002 through 2005, including, but not 
limited to, this $20 million capital contribution. FTC demanded that, as a condition to 
making this additional $20 million contribution, the general partner and the Fund agree to 
apply a single rolling two-year lock-up period to all withdrawals of FTC's capital account. 
This would permit FTC to make a complete withdrawal or partial withdrawals from FTC's 
capital account with respect to FTC's entire aggregate investment in the Fund each time 
the rolling two-year lock-up period ended. Given the size of FTC's investment and its 
early commitment to the Fund, I decided that the Fund should grant this request. 
10. 
On January 11, 2005, I signed a letter agreement that gave FTC the right to make 
withdrawals of its capital account, upon 120 days prior notice, at the calendar quarter 
ending after the two-year anniversary of January 1, 2005 (lt, March 31, 2007) and at the 
end of each two-year period thereafter (i. , March 31, 2009, 2011, etc.). As the 
controlling principal of the general partner for the Fund, I understood that FTC's rights 
under the January I I, 2005 Letter Agreement allowed FTC to withdraw all or part of its 
entire capital account in the Fund at the end of these lock-up periods. It was my and the 
Fund's understanding and intention that the January 11, 2005 Letter Agreement applied to 
FTC's aggregate investment in the Fund from 2002 through 2005 and not exclusively to 
FTC's January 1, 2005 investment of $20 million. It was also my and the Fund's 
understanding and intention that the January 11, 2005 Letter Agreement allowed any 
number of "partial" withdrawals, as opposed to only one "complete" withdrawal. The 
Fund subsequently took contrary positions on the advice of counsel.
