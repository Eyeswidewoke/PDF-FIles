to topple governments. If I were Scott, I would take full page ads in every paper in America and proclaim Facebook is 
the new "right is might" against injustice not one heroic king against the Nazis. 
Harvey wanted me to stay in New York and make phone calls to every old person I court. This race is a fight to Feb. 
22 at 5:00pm and the longer the ballots stay out the more vulnerable TICS is. 
I got off the plane with two stuffed ears. They remained blocked for hours. I just woke up and they arc less blocked 
but I still have slight inner ear aches and a sore throat. I may go to a doctor this morning because I am concerned 
about flying home. Never a dull moment. Also thinking about my sick mother and feel so sad for her. 
Glad I came for networking. Spent time with Colin Firth and all the European distributors that go to Cannes. Went 
to a lame small party for The Fighter that was 100 people crowded into an upstairs room in a hotel with adorable Amy 
Adams standing around with Jim Sheridan (has a hot new film for Universal with Daniel Craig and Rachel 
Wciss...and yes he saw the whole affair on his set), Terry Gilliam and distributors. The same guys have TKS and 
Fighter in Europe and they brought 11W in. 
Then went to Erie Feiner/Working Title/Vogue dinner party and was seated next to Nick Jones. owncr of Soho 
House and right in back of Colin, Elizabeth Murdoch...yes I got her and Colin nuts with the Logue/Keith Murdoch 
letters sitting in 102 Dame Elizabeth's attic in a shoebox....and they roared when I told them I put Mark Logue onto 
Wendil 
Eric Feltner was telling me he was pissed at Harvey for jumping on his date (creating competing dinners) that he 
has had for yean...but he understood I had to leave at 10:30pm because I was getting emails from Victoria...to get over 
there. 
Eric made me introduce him to l..ucy Walker (who I asked to bring) and he is now taking her to lunch to talk about 
work. 
As chic as the Vogue party was (and I met one if Annabel Aston's daughters) once again Harvey's party was so 
much better with more film people, actors, a better mix, better room, better slightly brighter lighting, more table 
hoping and energy. Leave it to FEW to put a party together in a week that was better than the one organized in the 
beginning of January. 
(But you know I am always less impressed with well dressed fashion people than articulate show biz.) 
I am going to the Momentum Distributing lunch for their Balla nominees at noon...then resting...maybe Asprey 
cocktails but I know any party in a store is bad and Charles Finch's famous dinner. (He was at Eric's.) 
Sunday, I may go to Ginge Manor for lunch with Annabel Astor...she offend to send a car and her daughter said it's 
an hour and 15 away. 
Then Bann's, the dinner. HW's after-party and home Monday. 
Might try to do something for Emily Smith on Page Six...which 11W would love...someone told ne Emily "loves" 
me...hope that does not get around. After the double truck Geoffrey Rush story...) think it's overkill...but will probably 
write or call her anyway. 
I am very glad I came. Angus has been a doll. I met his soon to be very rich ex-wife. Mcil dc Boutton. He had 
fashion designer Oswald Boateng bring her. She was chic and very sweet. (Angus is reported to be getting about 50 
million in the settlement...wild.). The house he is renting with in walking distance of Mcil's has been rented by Trudi 
and Sting and Madonna. 
Saw everyone at HW's from Nick Halsam to old wrinkled Roger Wood to SIR Ben Kingsley who has been 
nominated for four Oscars...to Harry Potter's Emma Thompson and dizzy Rosemund Pike, Sally Hawkins and Lesley 
Manville who I introduced to Tom Hooper months ago. 
I told Amy Adams she has behaved like a lady with all the hoop-a-la going to Melissa Leo and she will win an 
Oscar very soon. She s000 appreciated that one. Met the girl from "The Dragon Tatoo" who is gorgeous in person and 
sat with 13az Bamiboye too.
