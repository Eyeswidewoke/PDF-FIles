1990 Fed. Res. Interp. Ltr. LEXIS 350 
has been changed to indicate that Sovran has twelve banking subsidiaries, and the next sentence of this 
paragraph has been changed to indicate that C&S has five banking subsidiaries. 
3. To reflect more accurately the legal names of certain C&S subsidiary banks, Items numbered 2 and 3 
of Appendix A are revised to read as follows: 
"2) The Citizens and Southern National Bank of Florida, Fort Lauderdale, Florida." and "3) The Citizens 
and Southern National Bank of S.C., Columbia, South Carolina." 
4. Appendix B of the Order has been revised to include Sovran Credit Corporation, Sovran Equity 
Mortgage Corporation, Sovran Mortgage Corporation and C&S Family Credit, Inc., as items numbered 3, 4, 7 
and 13 respectively. All of these companies conduct lending activities pursuant to section 225.25(b)(1) of 
Regulation Y (12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(1)). The other companies listed in this Appendix have been renumbered 
accordingly. These companies were not originally included in this Appendix because they engage in 
insurance activities pursuant to section 225.25(b)(8) of Regulation Y (12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(8)). To reflect the 
fact that the Board intended to consider all of the insurance activities of the subsidiaries to be acquired by 
Applicant at one time (in light of the allegations made by the Protestants about the scope and permissibility 
of various insurance activities conducted by these insurance subsidiaries), the following sentence has been 
added to the end of footnote 24 of the Order: 
"In this regard, the insurance activities conducted by Sovran Credit Corporation, Sovran 
Equity Mortgage Corporation, Sovran Mortgage Corporation and C&S Family Credit, Inc. are 
not approved by this Order, but will be considered in conjunction with Avantors applications to 
acquire the insurance subsidiaries of C&S and Sovran." 
5. To reflect the fact that Sovran Trading Company/Central South was acquired pursuant to section 
4(c)(14) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. § 1843(c)(14)) ("BI-IC Act"), and not pursuant to 
section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. § 1843(c)(8)), the reference to this company in Appendix B as item 
number 6 has been deleted. All other companies listed in this Appendix have been renumbered accordingly. 
Additionally, the following clause has been added to the last sentence in the first paragraph and the first 
sentence of the second last paragraph of the Order: 
lo acquire Sovran Trading Company/Central South pursuant to section 4(c)(14) of the BHC Act and . . ." 
These technical revisions have no substantive effect on the Board's approval issued July 24, 1990, of 
this transaction. In addition, this is to confirm that the Order was intended to include the approval of Applicant 
to acquire the intermediate bank holding companies of C&S and Sovran, namely, Citizens and Southern 
Georgia Corporation, Citizens and Southem Florida Corporation, Citizens and Southern South Carolina 
Corporation, Citizens and Southern Trust Company, Inc. and Sovran Financial Corporation/Central South.
