the University r=aching out to individuals after the Buzzfeed story who then wrote to the U=iversity. There are a host of 
questions that need to be answered. an= wiggle room with questions at or after meeting... Moreover, just because 
=omeone from Mongolia complains about me does not mean the University is em=owered to investigate that.. In any

you will see it is a long process that extends way beyond wha= I am embarking on next week. 
In any case, as a result, I am taking the following action today. l=want to 
continue listen carefully to your advice, believe it or not, but l=need to feel I have a legal expert familiar with Title IX to 
talk with as =ell, and there is no perfect person.. but Nancy and I have decided t= retain Justin, who, while perhaps too 
eager to be combative at this stage= will work for me, and not vice versa, and has extensive experience with u=iversity 
processes, including at ASU. His main interest is making th= process fair, and if it is not, holding the University 
accountable after =he fact. I think that meshes with my goal as well. I do feel much be=ter about him than I did about 
having Johnny's lawyer, which was d=lusional on my part. Plus I will be much more critical of advice, as I wil= be 
bouncing it off you as well.. I hate spending the money, but Na=cy reminds me that in the old days this is less than I 
would have received=for a single lecture. 
So, once again, I un=erstand your concerns.frustrations, knowledge, 
recriminations, etc, but th=s is what I am going to do. So, I am either going to waste $15K or g=t some useful payback 
for it, and I will either kindly accept your offer t= let me waste your $25K, or my $25K. If you feel sufficiently strong=y 
that you don't want to follow through on what you so generously =ffered before, which was to provide $25K for me to 
work with however I fel= I wanted to do, and perhaps largely for our mental health if necessary, l=will not of course 
hold it against you in any way. You have be=n so generous with your time and friendship, which in the end is so much
