problem =s that all of this stuff looks cool. Consequently there is a new cottage industry that specializes in supp=ying 
military grade weapons to police departments.

The f=tal shooting of Michael Brown in the summer of 2014 sparked a series of protests in Ferg=son, Missouri which 
quickly spread across the country. The strength of the law enforcement response in Ferguson to these protests set off a 
fierce debate about the increasing militarization of the American police force. Thomas Mo=ton goes to Ferguson at the 
height of the protests to get an in-depth look at t=e situation on the ground. He then goes to Urban Shield in Oakland, 
Californi= and talks to expert Radley Balko to learn how US SWAT teams and police are being trained and how they are 
getting military grade equipment to police t=eir local communities. Senator Rand Paul discusses the efforts being made 
in Washington to address this issue, and its underlying causes. 
Obviously =e have gone too far.... "When we dress police officers as soldiers that are going to act like soldiers." Norm 
Sta=per (former Chief of Police in Seattle during the WTO Protest in 1999), he is the guy w=o put cops in storm trooper 
uniforms on American streets in from of the eyes =f the global media, "I screwed up royally. We were totally 
overwhelmed by numbers and then we did something really, really foolish. We teargased non-threaten, non-violent 
demonstrators who si=ply wouldn't obey our orders." Remember that soldiers follow or=ers for a living. Police officers 
are asked to make decisions for a living. And when police officers start acting like soldiers we have a problem and we 
have American police departments acting like an occupational force. This creates=a cycle of protesters heavy-handed 
tactics and police react by using those ex=ct same heavy-handed tactics. This has now escalated to where now the cops 
resemble=an occupying army but civilians have gone past protesting and have begun threatening and attacking 
individual officers like insurgents under an occupation. This has forced legislators to now take notice. 
Police are=our neighbors, friends and family who have taken on the responsibly to keep us safe. And in like any 
organization or society there are some bad apples and=bad policies. But by now it is evident that bigger and bigger 
vehicles and bigger and bigger weapons and more and more intrusive searches is not working, especially when there is a 
disproportion=l effect on minority communities. Yet, people wonder why people in Ferguson and New =ork are so mad. 
Studies say that whites are using illegal drugs at the same rat= as black people. Yet you have a four times greater chance 
getting arrested for drugs and being shot be the police you have 28 times. Again something is wrong. And it is not only 
our police departments. It is our judicial system as well. And one way to stop this trend/cycle is by =e-militarizing our 
police departments and demanding that our police offers explore solutio=s before shooting. As happened on May 2, 
2015 when an unarmed mentally ill homeless suspect being subdued by four po=ice officers was fatally shot. Don't they 
have training for that? =And if four healthy Los Angeles police officer can't subdue a suspect without killing him maybe 
they shoul= be in another line of work. But what has contributed to this mindset is the militarization of police
