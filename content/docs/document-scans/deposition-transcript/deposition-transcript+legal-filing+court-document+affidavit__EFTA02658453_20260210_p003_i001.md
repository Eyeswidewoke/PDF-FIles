I imagine that pure work in a computer science lab can make some interestin= progress on challenges 2 and 3. 
Challenge 4: I don't understand enough about the context to see the=significance yet; I would think that once 
we have an SMT model of language=formation, we can learn additional operations that perform operations on t=e 
generated mental representation, based on arbitrary signals. This may re=uire us to leave an approach that attempts to 
sandbox language from genera= cognition, but why would we want to constrain SMT based models by such a =andbox? 
Challenge 5: Again, I don't understand enough of the context to und=rstand why probabilistic interpretation 
cannot fill in the gaps. A probabi=istic model will weight alternatives, and the binary Merge is the simplest= preferred 
case? 
Challenge 6: The question of the structure of individual lexical items migh= require a perspective that integrates 
mental representations beyond langurge/SMT. 
Challenge 7: Do semantic atoms refer to the external world ("refere=tial doctrine")? — This seems to be quite 
clearly false; t=ey refer to representations in the neocortex that are mutable and acquired=through learning (structure 
or reinforcement) and inference. 
Challenge 8: Noam seems to agree with my take on 7. How are semantic items =cquired? — This challenge comes 
down to the general problems of le=rning and perception, i.e. pretty much everything in cognitive science out=ide of 
language! Challenge 8 seems to be designed by a rocket scientist wh= specializes in combustion chambers and leaves all 
other parts of getting =he rocket to fly as an exercise to their grad student... 
Challenge 9: Noam suggests that meaning must be derived from innate informa=ion, and wants to study 
universals between language to identify the innate=bits. However, it is not clear if they do not stem from the properties 
of =athematics, i.e. there is a limited space of "useful simple axioma=ic systems" that can be individually explored by 
learning systems.=Kant attempted to describe this space, identified it as apriori and synthe=ic, and listed the basic 
structural categories that we would use to charac=erize the world. Sowa and a few others have made contributions to 
basic on=ologies, and perhaps it is time to revisit Kant's project? 
Challenge 10: Do music, planning, arithmetic stem from language, or do all =esult from a shared innovation of 
modern hominid brains? — Obvious=y, different answers in that space might be possible, for instance music c=uld be a 
parasitic byproduct of rewards for discovering compositional repr=sentations that our brain needs to make us interested 
in learning grammar,=while basic planning is independent, and complex planning needs language f=r structuring and 
operating on the conceptual space. This makes the questi=n extremely general. 
It also gives rise to the more general question of what exactly makes homo =apiens different from the other 
chimpanzees. I suspect that our brains are=trained layer by layer, whereby each layer has a time of high plasticity d=ring 
its primary training phase, then undergoes synaptic pruning, and has =ow plasticity later on. The duration of the training 
phases is regulated b= genetic switches. Increasing the duration will extend infancy and childho=d (i.e. increase the cost 
of upbringing), but give each layer more trainin= data. Perhaps humans outperform other apes because they get a 
magnitude m=re training data before their brains lose infant plasticity, which results=in dramatically better ability to 
generalize and abstract? 
Challenge 11: Rare constructions can be understood by children, and thus th=re should be a mechanism to 
derive them from more simple rules, despite ap=arent evidence to the contrary, which should be explained [away). 
Challenge 12: Noam suggests that the complexity of most constructions in th= face of "poverty of stimuli" means 
that I-languages are 1= very similar, 2. differences result from externalization, 3. should there=ore stem from UG. He 
wants this shown, or an alternative.
