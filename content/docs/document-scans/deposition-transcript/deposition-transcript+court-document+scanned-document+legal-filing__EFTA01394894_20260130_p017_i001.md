4.5 
Withholding Taxes. The Fund shall comply with withholding requirements under any 
applicable law (including under FATCA) and shall remit amounts withheld to and file required forms 
with the applicable jurisdictions. If requested by the Manager, each Member shall deliver to the Manager: 
(i) an affidavit in form satisfactory to the Manager that the applicable Member is not subject to 
withholding under the provisions of any U.S. federal (including under FATCA), state, local, foreign or 
other law; (ii) any certificate that the Manager may reasonably request with respect to any such laws; 
and/or (iii) any other form or instrument reasonably requested by the Manager relating to any Member's 
status under AEOI. In the event that a Member fails or is unable to deliver to the Manager an affidavit 
described in clause (i) of this Section 4.5, the Manager will withhold amounts from such Member in 
accordance with the remainder of this provision. To the extent the Fund is required to withhold and pay 
over any amounts (including under FATCA) to any authority with respect to distributions or allocations to 
any Member, the amount withheld shall be treated as a distribution in the amount of the withholding to 
that Member. In the event of any claimed over-withholding, Members shall be limited to an action against 
the applicable jurisdiction. If the amount withheld was not withheld from actual distributions, the Fund 
may, at its option, (A) require the Member to reimburse the Fund for such withholding or (B) reduce any 
subsequent distributions by the amount of such withholding. Each Member shall indemnify the Manager 
and the Fund against any losses and liabilities (including interest and penalties) related to any withholding 
obligations with respect to allocations or distributions made to it by the Fund (unless such loss or liability 
resulted from the bad faith of the Manager) and any taxes imposed on the Fund due to such Member's 
non-compliance with AEOI. The provisions contained in this Section 4.5 shall survive the dissolution of 
the Fund, the withdrawal of any Member or the transfer or assignment of any Member's Interest. 
4.6 
Liability for Certain Taxes. If the Fund is subject to any tax, interest and penalties 
under Section 6225 of the BBA Audit Rules ("Tax Liabilities"), the Manager shall allocate among the 
Members any such Tax Liability in a manner it determines to be fair and equitable by deducting amounts 
from Capital Accounts or reducing amounts otherwise distributable to the Members, taking into account 
any modifications attributable to a Member pursuant to Section 6225(c) of the BBA Audit Rules (if 
applicable). To the extent that the Manager cannot allocate such Tax Liabilities through adjustments to 
Capital Accounts or distributions to the Members and to the extent that a portion of the Tax Liabilities 
imposed under Section 6225 of the BBA Audit Rules for a prior year relates to a former Member, the 
Members and former Members shall indemnify and hold harmless the Fund for their respective share of 
such amounts as determined by the Manager in accordance with the foregoing. 
Each Member 
acknowledges that, notwithstanding the transfer or withdrawal of all or any portion of its Interest, it may 
remain liable for Tax Liabilities with respect to its allocable share of income and gain of the Fund for the 
taxable years (or portions thereof) prior to such transfer or withdrawal, as applicable, under Section 6225 
of the BBA Audit Rules. 
5. 
ALLOCATIONS OF PROFITS AND LOSSES 
5.1 
Allocation of Profits and Losses. After giving effect to the allocations set forth in 
Section 5.2, items of Fund income, gain, loss, expense or deduction for any Fiscal Year or other allocation 
period shall be allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Members in such a manner that, as of the end of 
such Fiscal Year or other allocation period, the sum of (a) the Capital Account of each Member, (b) such 
Member's share of minimum gain (as determined according to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)) 
and (c) such Member's partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (as defined in Treasury Regulations 
Section l.704-2(i)(3)) shall be equal to the respective net amount, positive or negative, which would be 
distributed to such Member or for which such Member would be liable to the Fund under this Agreement, 
determined as if the Fund were to (x) liquidate its assets for an amount equal to their book values 
determined according to the rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)) and (y) distribute 
the proceeds of liquidation pursuant to Section 11.3(iv) as of the end of such Fiscal Year or other 
allocation period. Any decision regarding allocations to the Capital Accounts of the Members shall be
