"the mess" 
In my case meaning that my life is unoptimized. I am not getting enough time to spend on 
things that matter (enjoying life and the people I want to enjoy life with) and am spending 
90% of my time running around like a crazy person doing things that are required of me based 
on my current "mess" but that are not the best use of me or my time. 
I know everyone is blaming the economic meltdown for their financial woes but in my case its 
been particularly shitty. And for fun, throw on top of that the health reform shitfest that is 
going on. Change and uncertainty make investors, CEO's, biz dev folks and customers rather 
gun shy. And we got hit from every angle possible. Our investors who have supported us 
through all of our development efforts have either come in with less or not at all in 2009. And 
if you want to lead a stressful life try running an undercapitalized business. No matter how 
promising the business is it's as if I'm trying to run with my feet stuck in cement. And then 
there are the CEO's of all of the companies that we thought might partner or potentially buy 
us in 2009-2010 whose share prices halved this year. And I watched all of the top CEO's in my 
industry having to hit the road and beg investors to hold on to their stock. And then there are 
the biz dev folks who manage the nuts and bolts of deal-making. With a major portion of 
startups either running on fumes or turning belly up, these guys sat patiently like vultures and 
waited until the end of the year to scoop up all the bargains. It was like shopping at 
Walmart. And when you're buying things at a 75% discount, who cares about quality. And 
then there are the customers who will dance to the tune of anyone who is able to pay for 
their time and fancy dinners to get them to consider you. (I don't mind this part) 
My options include, shutting the company down or hacking together a solution to not only 
keep the lights on but to build a business that will produce an exit. 
I can't simply shut the company down — there are layers and layers of complexity here. I care 
share by phone. Unfortunately its not just about me. (I have considered running away and 
becoming a yoga instructor in Hawaii!) It is about all of the people who took a risk on me. 
And if I run away right now the consequences would be extremely grave and not just in the 
financial sense. 
So what are the alternatives? 
I have solved part of the problem already. I am actively working with attorneys to re-
structure the business so that I am able to take on additional capital from institutional 
sources. I have met with multiple VC firms who are very excited about the possibility of 
investing $15-$20M in the company on different terms than are being offered. They want to 
make sure they have room to share in the upside. I feel confident that within 3-4 months we 
could be well capitalized again and then I can decide whether I want to continue in my
