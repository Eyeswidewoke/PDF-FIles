14. Will all Plan Shares that I direct the Trustee to tender be purchased? 
This depends upon the total number of Shares tendered and the price at which you tender. If you tender Shares at a 
price above the Purchase Price, your Shares will not be purchased. If you tender your Shares at or below the Purchase 
Price or you elect to tender your shares at whatever Purchase Price results from the Dutch auction process, and more 
Shares are tendered at or below the Purchase Price by all stockholders than the Company had offered to purchase, then 
the Company will purchase a pro rata portion of the Shares that you directed to be tendered. See Q&A #1 for a 
descripti=n of how proration works. 
Plan Shares held in your Savings and Retirement Plan Account that are not accepted will remain in the Limited, Inc. Stock 
Fund subject to normal Savings and Retirement Plan rules. 
15. How will I know if my Plan Shares have been purchased? 
After the Offer has expired, all tender directions will be tabulated, which may take up to two weeks. Soon thereafter you 
will be sent a statement of the number of your Plan Shares which were accepted.

but before the offer expires?

received before or during this period will be processed as soon as reasonably feasible.
