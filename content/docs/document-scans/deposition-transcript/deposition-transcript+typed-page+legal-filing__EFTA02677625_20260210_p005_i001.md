DOE program before declaring,="I'm exhausted." Their focus on those outliers in =he DOE program, however, was "both 
stale and overblown," GigaOM's Katie Fehrenbacher argues.

To CBS' credit, it has been a rocky road for some=venture capitalists in the clean technology sector, Fehrenbacher notes. 
There was a bubble, but "only in the venture capital, Silicon Valley ecosystem," she explains. "60 Minutes" did itself a 
disservice by combining the "totally separate and different" stories of venture capital and federal support for green 
technology. One problem, according to Fehrenbache= is that clean tech is a "convoluted term," that "can mean many 
things, and isn't all that helpful as an organizing group." The segm=nt makes reference to the "general cleantech area," 
while discussing biofu=ls, solar panels, electric vehicles, and other widely divergent industries. 
Critics have also noted that the words "climate change," "global warming," "greenhouse gas emissions&qu=t; or "carbon 
dioxide" were never uttered in the "60 Minutes" segment. "Si=ply put, 60 Minutes is flat wrong on the facts," U.S. 
Department of Energy spokesman Bill Gibbons said in a= emailed statement. "The clean energy economy in America is 
real =nd we are increasingly competitive in this rapidly-expanding global industry. This is=a race we can, must and will 
win."

But for me the real issue is that it is not the failu=es that make us great, it is our successes. People forget that NASA's 
first launches were disasters and that 90% of start-ups fail and that is even in Silicon Valley. I wonder how many people 
sailed west before Columbus. And the personal computer or the cell phone did not start with Apple. We have to=get 
away from this sense of immediate gratification and do what the Chinese are doing

 As for 
60 Minutes, their resent shoddy journalism makes diehards like me long for Don Hewitt to return from=the grave, but 
then even under his rein the show stumbled and one of the reason= maybe because morphing journalism into 
entertainment to achieve ratings wit=out offending sponsors and political heavyweights in itself will lead to these types 
of problems/issues. 
It seems like every week there is a new po=itical scandal ("bridge-gate") in the country that diverts everyone's attention 
from fixing the many proble=s and issues currently facing the country, with the latest is the four-day closur= last 
September of several lanes of the George Washington Bridge that connects th= states of New York and New Jersey and 
is the busiest traffic bridge in the nation — the result of what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said was polit=cal 
retribution by his staff. Not only was the decision to close access roads in Fort Lee, N.J. skullduggery, it may have 
=iolated Federal Law and the laws of both States. More importantly it caused a massive traffic jam inconveniencing 
hundreds of thousands of commuter and business traffic, as well as potentially endan=ering lives. Emails released 
earlier this week suggest that Christie's senior advisors had concocted a plan to cause a massive traffic jam in Fort Lee to 
punish t=e town's Democrat mayor, Mark Sokolich, for not endorsing Republican Christ=e's November reelection. At a 
lengthy news conference Thursday, Christie apologized for the action and said he had no idea his aides had be=n 
involved. Even if we take him for his word we should be outraged that a =roup of Americans believed that this type of 
behavior was okay.
