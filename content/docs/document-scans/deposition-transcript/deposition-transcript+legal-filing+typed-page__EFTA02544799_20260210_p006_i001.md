I would like to renew my request that you arrange for Max to resign as trustee for the marital trusts, and 
expeditiously, for reasons I will expla=n below. 
I have already spelled out some of the reasons why I cannot trust Max. =AO I hope you have read those detailed 
letters, which only tell part of the story, though it was more then enough. By now the situation has becom= completely 
intolerable. 
During the years when Max was serving as my lawyer, he saw no problem when the IRA that is my source of 
income was being depleted by distributions to 10 family members -- which alone amounted to half of the mandatory 
withd=awals -- along with payment of taxes and management fees for the entire estate.=C2 All of that exhausted the 
annual withdrawal, and the IRA was exhausted further by payments for the Wellfleet house, Alex's medical expenses, 
a=d others that you know about, compelling me to make further withdrawals just for ordinary daily expenses, and 
imposing the exorbitant taxes charged for such withdrawals. Max saw no problem with that. He never suggested any 
financial accounting from any of the beneficiaries. I trusted him, mistakenly, as in the case of the purchase of the 
apartment and the outlandish loan from the marital trust, which I assumed would be for a few weeks until the Lexington 
house was sold, not realizing -- though he surely did -- that I would receive nothing for that and would be stuck with an 
expensive apartment I could not possibly afford and a loan that I never would have agreed to had I understood. 
Now, all of a sudden, everything has changed. Suddenly, Max has all sorts of scruples and legalistic demands. 
What caused the sudden change? It is because now I am requesting that taxes be paid by the marital trust. For the first 
time, Max insists on extensive (and of course outrageous) financial surveillance, claiming that as trustee, he is concerned 
with life expectancy (I might live too long) and with the long-term effect on the trust -- matters that never concerned 
him while he watched my IRA being depleted with payment of taxes and management fees for the entire estate, in 
addition to distributions to family. No scruples, no concerns, all fine as long as it was rapidly depleting my source of 
income. 
To make this even more outrageous, the marital trust is, of course, intende= for the use of the married couple 
who established it, to be their main resource during their lifetimes, and the lifetime of the surviving spouse.=C2 That is 
the obvious intention of a marital trust, and that should end the matter, within a family. But it is even true of the 
wording, if we have to descend to legalities. Not just for taxes, which is what I am requesting, but for daily life. 
As you know, the trusts were in Carol's name for two reasons: one, we a=sumed that she would be the survivor, 
and two, for estate tax reasons, to assure that the three children would receive the maximum benefits after we both 
died. 
In addition, Max has apparently been allowing distributions from the marita= trust to children and grandchildren 
without consulting me -- and, of course= without calling for investigation of their financial circumstances. That concern 
is reserved for my request for tax payments from a trust to which, by rights, I should have full access. 
I can think of only one explanation: Max, as your lawyer, is seeking to ensure that you receive every penny 
possible: not just the trusts and educa=ional trusts of which you are the sole beneficiaries, along with the two houses, 
and almost all of my pension, but even the marital trusts that M and I established for ourselves. I can think of no other 
reason for his radical change of attitude from the time that the IRA was being exhausted before his eyes to today, with 
sudden concern about long-term potential problems with the marital trust and possible excessive life expectancy. =AO 
No doubt he can contrive various legalisms, but I hope it is clear enough why these should not even be considered in 
matters such as this. 
Plainly, this situation -- which I have only partially described -- is unacceptable. And it would be even apart from 
what I have already written to you, and you know without my spelling it out. 
To repeat, I've worked hard all my life and have been very careful to p=ovide for the needs of my children and 
grandchildren, and to ensure that they will be well cared for after my death, even abandoning my pension and main
