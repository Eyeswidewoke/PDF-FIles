purposes of this Amendment and the Security Agreement. 
(b) 
This Amendment and the Security Agreement contain the entire agreement among Agent

given. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which when taken together

force and effect. 
(f) 
This Amendment shall be binding upon Borrower and its successors and assigns and shall 
inure to the benefit of Agent and Lenders and their respective successors and assigns. Time is of the essence 
with regard to this Amendment.
