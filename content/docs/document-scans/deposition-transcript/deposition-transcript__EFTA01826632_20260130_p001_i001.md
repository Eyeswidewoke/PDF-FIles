Subject Re: 
if ,you are not to blame for what happend„ in this case„ who is?. THAT IS MY POINT> you 
cant avoid it- It is as a direct result of your many poor choices. yours and yours alone., . I am not 
disciplining you. you have not been punished, sentenced or penalized by me, I love you and it 
pains me to see this.. when people suggest you treat me with the same degree of careless reckless 
poor judgment that you have treated balle , no one suggests you are not loyal or do not love 
either. THe reality is that your view of things arc skewed,the facts of your actions and the results 
of your behavior, are i hope easier to see with Balle. I have been by your side for years , I am the 
most loyal friend you could ever hope to have, i have taken you from a girl with not even a high 
school education and did my best to guide you to adulthood. You refused to meet what i said my 
needs were,and continued to follow your own choices, nagging nagging, nagging, and continuing 
in the face of reality to fabricate an illusory , view of your actual help.. I am hoping that the BAII-
e situation clarifies your role. In her case , if you were to tell her , but last year i was loyal and 
stood by your cage when you were sick, and you know i love you. JUST look in her eyes, -you 
ignored Jefffreys advice re peabo. i know you care , but that is not enough, your actions are 
directly responsible for what has happned . your actions , not your motivations , your actions

I don't know how our recollection of events can be so different. 
In my view you offered no guidance or help with difficult decisions when Ball-c was pregnant 
and in labor. You placated me by repeating I can do what I want because it's my dog. To 
questions you responded without giving it thought with 5 contradicting answers so when I 
pick X and something goes wrong, you can then say 'I told you to do Y. 
You left to NYC and didn't answer your phone when she was giving birth while Story stayed on 
the phone with me throughout the night. I was terrified about anything going wrong and I 
made decisions not based on Story's opinion, but the vet's. I hope we can at least agree I 
absolutely wanted to do what was best for Ball-e and had no other motivation. You made no 
decisions, waited for the result of mine and then lectured me about what I did wrong. Well, at 
that point I could see it for myself and don't need anyone to point out the mistakes. Regarding 
Fatt-e you were unfortunately again not available during the critical moments and I had to 
make decisions by myself about where to take her and what to do. You clearly had no control 
over it and I am not suggesting you left me without help on purpose. You were very helpful 
and kind once you landed. I did the best I could and there was nothing irresponsible or 
reckless about my decisions. I do feel guilty for not being home for the few hours before you 
left when something happended to Fatt-e. 
For the record, I am not suggesting you are responsible for anything that happend with the dogs 
at all. They were fully my responsibility. You were not involved and I realize the mistakes that 
were made. What I am saying is that you are not in a position to discipline me about it or 
blame me for what happened
