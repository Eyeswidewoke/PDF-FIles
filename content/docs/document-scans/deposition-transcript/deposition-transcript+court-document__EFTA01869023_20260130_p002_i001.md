adds(The Sterling Companies/Sterling Centrecorp) and NPCM is a mortgage fund he founded in the 
Bahamas in 2007 and runs. He was also involved in buying a bank in the Turks and Caicos.

a hard bargain. 
Dan says that TD was very obliging in entering into an agreement (a Mortgage Subordination Agreement) but I 
read it and find it a strict subordination agreement, with several restrictions on what NPCM can do in the 
event of default. TD does give NPCM an option to buy the first for all amounts secured (including fees, 
advances and expenses) for a scant 10 days after notice of default. Nevertheless, TD asked for and got in 
exchange: a S998,000 principal paydown, a $1,041,379 interest reserve and a $137,849 tax reserve. (This 
was in January 2011.) This correlates to the use of proceeds he provided above. TD also got Dan's wife, 
Karen, as a guarantor. Dan already is a guarantor. 
Dan has discussed a refi nancing of the NPC M second with TD and says that TD would welcome it but wants 
an additional $1 million paydown plus an interest and tax reserve similar to what TD required in January. 
Dan's Finances 
I did not ask him to explain his financial condition at this stage but it seems obvious that he is illiquid from his 
'no alternative" comment and his characterization of the $1,467,000 balance of the proposed loan proceeds 
as "for Dan to live on". I also think he has a problematic net worth. 
His visible real assets seem to be: 
He has reduced the price to $64,900,000 and now owes $26,600,000. 'Survey says' a 
$40 number. Thus, Swanson's equity could range anywhere from 0 (if it doesn't sell before November) to 
sa $14,000,000. See discussion below.

$4,000,000. 
Swanson's equity in

is an older 2000 sf Bermuda house adjacent to his Phipps lots. He rents it out. He paid 
$350,000 in 1995 and owes $700,000 on a 20 yr self-amortizing mortgage. He pledged it as additional 
security for theme second held by NPCM in January 2011. It is probably worth $1,300,000. 
Interest in 
This is the spec house listed at $47 million. Jim Patterson of Louisville is his partner. 
McCann w to has e listing) says that they have had offers up to $30 million but Patterson has turned them 
down. Jim is allowed to say a deal can be made in the upper 530s but it seems there is buyer "reluctance" 
above $30. There is a $25,000,000 mortgage on it through U.S. Bank N.A. which was put in place in 
February 2011. If they could get $30M, Swanson's equity would presumably be $2,500,000 possibly less. 
(They paid $16.5M for the land in 2007.) 
This indicates Swanson's net worth from PB real estate is in the $6 million range + his equity in 
which as discussed could be zero to $14M. 
This does not account for cash, securities, other business interests, any other real estate outside PB, and 
tangibles. I do not have any information about these. I do not know of other assets and I do not think he has 
a pending project. 
He does have a endin and very active lawsuit against him by Leo Vecellio (Ranger Construction) who 
bought 
. This is a very acrimonious suit. Vecellio is seeking several million in damages for 
construction e ects and recently amended the suit to allege fraud by Dan, his wife, and his backer Dean 
DeSantis (son of Carl of Rexall-Sundown) and his wife. The fraud alleged is that Dan concealed water 
damage during construction due to hurricanes. This is well publicized and seems to be getting nastier and I 
assume very expensive to defend. 
Value of 
Dan has reduced the ask from $84 million to $64 million. Evidently appraisals were made by TD and NPCM in 
January that were in the $40s. Dan has asked that the TD appraisal be revised because of Moens sale of 
(the ex Krakoff lot) to the south for $22.7+ to Petterfy. (Swanson paid $20.6 for the land at
