magazines that i told you looked like a doctors office, you simply left month old 
magzines, for who. not me, . When I ask what did you do. , you get upset.. THIS IS 
BULLSHIT> people work , I work , I get up every day to work, YOU spend two 
hours making a soup and you feel your day is done. You serve me the shiftiest of 
bacon, why, you say because it was in the house, ? is it because you don't know 
better, didn't ask, can't read, can't see, can't taste. cant yet understand how to make 
eggs, and refuse to ask anyone who might know. Your focus is on what you get , on 
what you get, on what you get, classic0--- any thought of me ZERO, sperm on 
demand„ ---any thought of me,

Subject: sounds too familiar, this really upset me 
Women are led to have a sense of entitlement because they falsely believe they are 
owed something based on the social roles that they have taken for themselves. 
Because someone has accepted the role of being someone's girlfriend or wife, they 
feel entitled to dictate behavior , get things from the other person or, if not, sulk. 
Because someone has accepted the role of being a consumer, they feel entitled to 
be treated as they desire, though only usually performing any asked task at the 
level of bare minimum. ie. the passing grade. In short, they want to play the game 
without having to " earn " what they want, so they will make your life difficult if you 
don't give in their selfish beliefs. Learning to say" no", is the first step, not "maybe" , 
this will be taken as an eventual "yes". The sense of entitlement is accompanied by 
the confirmation of no consequences to selfish, self centered behavior, not sharing, 
withdrawing affection, complaining are the signs of non- acceptance of necessary 
required achievements.
