1992). Although the rule does not require a recitation of "every material 
detail" of the alleged fraud, it does require, at a minimum, "that 
plaintiffs support their allegations of fraud with all of the essential 
factual background that would accompany 'the first paragraph of any 
newspaper story'—that is, the 'who, what, when, where and how' of the events 
at issue." In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc., 311 F.3d at 217 (quoting In 
re Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1422). 
In Count I, plaintiffs allege that the defendants' conduct "constituted the 
making of fraudulent misrepresentations ... regarding the AIG Investment" 
that the defendants knew were materially misleading "because of their 
failure to state or disclose the additional or qualifying information 
regarding the investment banking relationship" of SSB with AIG. (Id, ¶ 46.) 
Count II vaguely states that the defendants' "statements and conducts ... 
included the expression of opinions which [the defendants] did not, in fact, 
truthfully hold." (Id. ¶ 50.) Count III claims that the defendants are 
liable to the plaintiffs for their failure to disclose this information, 
"because they knew that their nondisclosure would justifiably induce the 
Plaintiffs to proceed with the proposed investment." (Id. ¶ 52.) Finally, 
Count VI again claims that the defendants' conduct "constituted the making 
of fraudulent misrepresentations to, and/or fraudulent concealment and non-
disclosure of material facts." (Id. 1 63.) 
I agree with the defendants' assertions that Counts I, II, III, and VI do 
not meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading requirements. First, nowhere does 
the complaint state who made the alleged misrepresentations to the 
plaintiffs. See In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc., 311 F.3d at 218 
(finding that complaint failed to comply with Rule 9(b) because the 
allegation failed to identify the speaker, and "there is no indication that 
the speaker had the authority to speak on behalf of [the defendant] or that 
the employee was in regular contact with the [defendant]"). Second, the 
complaint fails to allege exactly what false statement or representation was 
made. Instead, it claims that the defendants' failure to inform them of 
SSB's relationship with AIG was fraudulent. This does not meet Rule 9(b)'s 
requirement that there be a false statement that the defendants knew was 
false. In addition, the plaintiffs' allegation that the defendants 
misrepresented their claims that they aspired to "the highest standards of 
moral and ethical conduct" is vague. Accordingly, I find that Counts I, II, 
III, and VI do not meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading requirement, and, 
therefore, I will dismiss them. I shall, however, grant the plaintiffs 
thirty days within which to amend the complaint to comport with Rule 9(b).3 
See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d at 1434 (noting that 
ordinarily, when a complaint is dismissed under Rule 9(b) for failure to 
plead fraud with the requisite particularity, leave to amend the complaint 
is granted). 
III. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, I will deny Citibank's and Citigroup's motions to 
dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, to dismiss for improper venue, 
and to transfer this matter to the United States District Court for the
