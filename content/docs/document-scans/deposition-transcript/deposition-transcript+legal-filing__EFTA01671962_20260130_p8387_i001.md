Detail of Changes to the Membership Rewards Program Terms 
This notice amends the Membership Rewards program Terms and Conditions (the "Terms and Conditions") 
as described below. We have the right to amend as described in the Terms and Conditions. Any provisions in 
the Terms conflicting with this change are replaced fully and completely. Provisions not changed by this notice 
remain in full force and effect. 
Membership Rewards Program 
Effective June 1, 2017, (1) the following two sentences are deleted from the "For Canceling Your Account" 
subsection of the "Forfeiting And Getting Points Back" section of the Membership Rewards Terms and 
Conditions: "If we reinstate the Linked Card Account within one year. these forfeited points will be returned to 
your program account. If the only Linked Card Account is a Corporate Card and has been reinstated within 
one year, you must contact Membership Rewards at 1-800-AXP-EARN to have the forfeited points returned to 
your account:, and (2) the following sentence is deleted from the "Using Pay With Points To Book Travel On 
American Express® Travel, For Products Through Membershiprewards.com, And Elsewhere" subsection of the 
"Using Points" section of the Membership Rewards Terms and Conditions: "Corporate Card Members are not 
eligible to use points for Ticketmaster or Telecharge if the Corporate Card is the only Linked Card Account." 
Effective immediately, the following language will replace the first paragraph of the "Using Your Card" subsection 
of the "Getting Points" section: 
"Most Card Members will earn one point for every dollar charged for an eligible purchase to their Linked Card 
Account. Some Card Members will earn additional points for every dollar charged for an eligible purchase to 
their Linked Card Account, as noted in the Getting Additional Points section immediately below. To use points 
you have earned, including these additional points, you must pay the amount due on your Linked Card Account 
statement on time. If its necessary for you to enroll your Card in Membership Rewards in order to participate in 
the program, you won't earn points for eligible purchases that you made before your enrollment date. As long as 
you pay the minimum amount due, you will earn points for the full amount of any charge applied to the following: 
Sign & Travel®
Extended Payment Option 
Flexible Payment Option 
Select & Pay Later 
Eligible American Express Credit Card purchases 
From time to time, we may make promotional offers of points. These offers include terms about how you can earn 
the points and when you can use them. These offer terms may differ from the terms above concerning points 
earned for charges to your Linked Card account, including when you can use the points. 
You can view your point balance by logging onto your online account at www.americanexpress.com and viewing 
your account summary page. Some points may be shown as pending points. Pending points are points you will 
be able to use after we receive timely payment of the related amount due or in accordance with the terms of the 
offer for which the promotional points are awarded."
