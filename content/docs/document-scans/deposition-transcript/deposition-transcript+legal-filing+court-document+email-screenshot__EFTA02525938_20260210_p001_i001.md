Re: Ok 
you still avoid the quesiton „ what do you do. i don't hold the fact t=at i support you over you head, i ask over and over, 
what itis that you ac=ually do.. 
with regard the mattress, its was just find out which ma=ress was where. and the details, A simple and clear question.. 
all else=is silly.. you say its silly after stopping you, that was last week, an= i reiieterate , i just want you to do as i asl to 
oprahize the fact that = ask you to do something is now controlling. is another example of b00000s=it, WHAT do you 
actuallly do.. in return for that lifestyle, which i do=believe is not that important to you. do you spend time trying to be 
helpf=l or most of your time on treatments lessons, shopping ball-e. if your ans=er is that you provide loyalty , i have 
never questioned that. yo=r loyalty however has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that you h=ve not done as i 
asked, its not dis loyal , its just not what i ask. =IF you don't make any food, its not disloyal, if you dont' buy any=hing for 
me but tons for you, its not disloayl„ its just not what i want =r need. YOU have to wake up„ you are turning into a 
spoiled brat, that th=nks the world owes you something. , your expectations, are way out of w=ck.. and if your thank 
you, at the end of your letter, is supposed to b= funny , it is. otherwise. you say you find y postiotion inconsitant. l=t me 
be clear . TO be helpful is to do what i ask. if with re sex, it m=an s keeping in shape, thats easy . if its to get shapoos 
that s easy. if =ts to meddle in things, so you can feel important. Its unhelpful . you say=when i tried to do more, it was 
no more of what i asked , it was more of w=at you thought you should do... its not helpful..

The example has little to do with our situation but I am flattered you are =omparing me to an 18 year old. 
The mattress was a perfect example. It seems you are confusing my honesty a=d having your best interests in

I was the only one to confirm with you and make sure you get what you like = and instead of a thank you I got

So without me being involved when would you find out you are sleeping on Ka=en's cheap mattress? 
At least I do my best to make sure you get what you like for your house, no= my best to do things quickly behind

Don't you thing there is slight chance there are other similar things h=ppening and the idea of my involvement 
caused such a passionate reaction b=cause you would have a much higher chance of finding out about them... 
I don't know how you can say I do very little after stopping me when I =ried to do more..
