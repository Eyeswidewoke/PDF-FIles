<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">However, the transf=rmations in the region are expected not 
only to affect the position of cou=tries, but that of the Islamist movements as well. In particular it will b= interesting to 
see how Hamas re-evaluates 
its regional relations and whether the targeting of the movement in Gaza w=II drive it to restore close relations with 
Iran.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">The region as a whore has suffered from conflict between the 
two axes for years, and this has =ed to civil wars and sectarian conflict. It is now clear that the struggle=in Syria has 
reached a critical point 
for both sides, and there will be no solution unless Iranians, Turks and A=abs can work together. As for Iraq, its 
legislative elections will be held=in a few months. Sectarian polarisation in the country is claiming hundred= of lives on a 
monthly basis. Without 
reconciling Sunnis, Shias and Kurds, Iraq too is heading for more violencer</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Conflicting axes ca=not achieve stability in the region; only co-
operative efforts of all the =arties and countries involved can hope to do that. Today this all seems a =istant hope, and 
the region may have 
to experience more turmoil and chaos before this fact is accepted.</span><=p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">October 14, 2013 --=The Middle Eastern strongmen are back. 
The counterrevolution is in full sw=ng. Islamists and secular liberals do battle. The Shiite and Sunni worlds =onfront each 
other. A two-state Israeli-Palestinian 
peace looks impossible. Freedom is equated with chaos. For this region the=e is no future, only endless rehearsals of 
the past.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Poisoned by colonia=ism, stymied by Islam's battle with 
modernity, inebriated by oil, blocke= by the absence of institutions that can mediate the fury of tribe and eth=icity, 
Middle Eastern states turn in 
circles. Syria is now the regional emblem, a vacuum in which only the viol=nt nihilism of the jihadi thrives.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Just two and a half=years after the Arab Spring, talk of the future 
— any future — seems p=eposterous. Countries build futures on the basis of things that do not exi=t here: consensus as 
to the nature of the 
state, the rule of law, a concept of citizenship that overrides sectarian =llegiance, and the ability to place the next 
generation's prosperity abo=e the settling of past scores.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Syria's Bashar al=Assad has gassed his own people. Iraq is again 
engulfed in Sunni-Shiite vi=lence. The U.S.-trained Egyptian Army has slaughtered members of the Musli= Brotherhood. 
It is hard to recall the 
heady season of 2011 when despots fell and Arabs spoke with passion of fre=dom and personal empowerment. The 
Arab security state has shown its resili=nce; it breeds extremism. As the political theorist Benjamin Barber has no=ed, 
"Fundamentalism is religion 
under siege."</span></p>
