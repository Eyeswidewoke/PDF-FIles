itself and in a report from an independent Senate investigation. But the pressures on the agency have taken on 
even greater urgency in light of what the FBI identified as another attempt on Mr. Trump's life at his golf course in 
West Palm Beach, Fla., on Sunday. The article mentioned that Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of 
Connecticut and the chairman of a Senate subcommittee investigating the security failures in Butler, said that what 
happened on July 13 was clearly preventable. "Some of the lapses," he said, "are so egregious as to be almost 
unbelievable:' Interviews with federal, state and local officials and a review of documents provide an outline of 
how the planning process left vulnerabilities that allowed a 20-year-old video game enthusiast to open fire on 
Trump. The article stated that the most glaring problem was the multiple levels of deficient and confusing 
communications between the Secret Service and the local law enforcement agencies it was working with that day. 
The most prominent of those breakdowns involve warehouses, owned by AGR International, next to the rally site. 
The gunman, Thomas Crooks of Bethel Park, Pa., climbed on the roof of one of them to shoot at Trump. The article 
noted that the Times documented in interviews a series of discussions between the Secret Service and local law 
enforcement officials about the warehouses, showing not only that the failure to secure them was avoidable but 
also that the risk was very much on the minds of the personnel charged with securing the area. On July 12, during a 
six-hour walk-through, the Secret Service was still discussing ways to prevent the warehouses from being accessed 
by the public, including the possibility of adding a police patrol or parking farm equipment nearby. Despite all the 
talk, the warehouses were left unguarded. 
A Former Officer Texted a Photo of the Bloodied Tyre Nichols to His Ex-Girlfriend 
The Associated Press (09/18, Sainz) reported that a former Memphis police officer charged in the fatal 
beating of Tyre Nichols sent his ex-girlfriend a photo of the badly injured man on the night he was punched, kicked 
and hit with a police baton following a traffic stop, according to trial testimony Wednesday. Brittany Leake, a 
Memphis officer and Demetrius Haley's former girlfriend, testified during the criminal trial that she was on the 
phone with Haley when officers pulled Nichols over for a traffic stop. She said she heard a "commotion," including 
verbal orders for someone to give officers his hands. According to the article, the call ended, but Haley later texted 
the photo in a group chat comprising Haley, Leake and her godsister, she testified. Prosecutors displayed the photo 
for the jury. It showed Nichols with his eyes closed, on the ground with what appeared to be blood near his mouth 
and his hands behind his back. The article noted that Haley, Tadarrius Bean and Justin Smith are on trial after 
pleading not guilty to charges that they deprived Nichols of his civil rights through excessive force and failure to 
intervene, and obstructed justice through witness tampering. The Memphis Police Department fired the three 
men, along with Emmitt Martin III and Desmond Mills Jr., after Nichols' death. The beating was caught on police 
video, which was released publicly. The officers were later indicted on the federal charges. Martin and Mills 
have taken plea deals. The article stated that earlier Wednesday, Martin was on the witness stand for a third day. 
Defense attorneys tried to show inconsistencies between Martin's statements to investigators and his court 
testimony. Martin acknowledged lying about what happened to Memphis Police Department internal investigators, 
to try to cover up and "justify what I did:' But Martin said he told the truth to FBI investigators after he pleaded 
guilty in August, including statements about feeling pressure on his duty belt where his gun was located during the 
traffic stop, but not being able to see if Nichols was trying to get his gun. Martin has testified that he said "let go of 
my gun" during the traffic stop. ABC News (09/18, Negussie) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: Jeffrey Epstein Accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell's Sex Crime Convictions Upheld on 
Appeal 
MSNBC (09/18, Rubin) reported that a federal appeals court upheld the sex crime convictions of Jeffrey Epstein 
accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell on Tuesday. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it found "no errors" in what it 
called a complex case, rejecting several arguments from Maxwell, including that Epstein's unusual non-prosecution 
agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida barred prosecutors from the Southern District of New York from 
bringing the case against her. According to the article, the Florida agreement, which followed state and federal 
investigations into allegations of Epstein's unlawful sexual activity, didn't bind the New York office, the three-judge 
2nd Circuit panel ruled, despite the fact that the 2007 agreement said that the United States agreed not to bring 
any criminal charges against any potential Epstein co-conspirators. The article added that the panel cited 
precedent that says plea agreements only bind the U.S. Attorney's office in the district where the plea is entered, 
unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction. There's "nothing in the NPA 
that affirmatively shows that the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts,' the panel said, referring to the non-
prosecution agreement, adding that nothing presented to the appellate judges indicated that the New York office
