FBI Arrests New Texas Man Accused of Plotting School Shooting 
San Antonio Express-News (07/01, Contreras) reported that a Texas man has been indicted on gun charges after 
someone told the FBI that he could be plotting a mass shooting. The tipster reported that Cameron Peterson, 19, 
"has severe emotional issues, idolizes violence and school shootings and that he may emulate infamous prior mass 
shooters," according to a criminal complaint affidavit. The article stated that the tipster reportedly based the 
warning on secondhand information relayed by someone close to Peterson. That person told the tipster that 
Peterson discussed plans to commit mass shootings and kept journals in which he detailed fantasies and plans for 
school shootings. The article added that the FBI followed-up on the tip and found that Peterson had tried to buy a 
shotgun from a New Braunfels pawn shop in January, but the shop did not sell it to him because of his age and the 
type of gun he was trying to buy. The article noted that the FBI interviewed Peterson on May 21 at a home in New 
Braunfels. During that interview, he allegedly said he smoked marijuana daily. The FBI did not arrest him that day 
but added him to a list of people in the National Instant Background Check System who are prohibited from buying 
guns. Ten days later, Peterson tried to buy another shotgun at a pawn shop using an old address and did not report 
that he used drugs, according to the affidavit. The shop did not sell him the weapon after seeing his name was 
flagged in the NICS system. The FBI arrested Peterson in early June, and a federal grand jury last week indicted him 
on a count of attempted purchase of a firearm, "knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the firearm 
would be used to commit a felony, that is premeditated, intentional murder." Peterson was also indicted on a 
separate charge of making false statements on a firearm-purchase application for allegedly lying about his address 
and his use of marijuana on the firearm form. KENS (CBS-5) (07/01, Lynch) also reported on the story.
