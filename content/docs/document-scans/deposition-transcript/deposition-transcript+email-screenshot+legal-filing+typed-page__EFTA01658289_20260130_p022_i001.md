The Cleveland Plain Dealer (7/30, Tobias, 895K) reports from Columbus, Ohio, "The Ohio House 
of Representatives has voted unanimously to remove Larry Householder as Ohio House speaker 
a little more than one week following his arrest on federal corruption allegations. The vote was 
90-0, with 9 members, including Householder, absent. Members approved the measure swiftly 
without debate in a Thursday morning session." Householder, "a political aide and three 
lobbyists, including former Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges, were arrested last 
Tuesday in what federal authorities described as a $60 million bribery scheme. They were 
formally indicted on Thursday. The FBI says FirstEnergy funneled the money to Householder 
and his allies, including a network of shadowy political groups, to help elect Householder as 
speaker, in exchange for a nuclear bailout bill worth more than $1 billion that Householder 
pushed through the legislature." 
The AP (7/30, Amiri) reports, "Householder, his long-time adviser Jeffrey Longstreth, 
former Ohio Republican Party chairman Matt Borges and lobbyists Neil Clark and Juan Cespedes 
could each face up to 20 years in prison if they're convicted for their alleged work to pass the 
bailout and block attempts to overturn it, according to a criminal complaint filed by the FBI. A 
federal grand jury formally indicted the five on Thursday, charging each with a single count of 
racketeering." 
Fox News (7/30, Phillips, 27.59M) reports, "The arrests were part of a yearlong 
investigation into public corruption and bribery tied to legislation that bailed out two nuclear 
power plants in the state. The former speaker and his associates are accused of accepting 
corporate money for personal and political use to pass House Bill 6 to financially bail out two 
FirstEnergy nuclear plants with over $1 billion. Householder was a key player in the legislation, 
which added a fee to every electric bill in the state and directed over $150 million a year 
through 2026 to the plants near Cleveland and Toledo." 
NBC News (7/30, Fieldstadt, Li, 6.14M) reports, "Householder is the first Ohio House 
speaker ever removed by the chamber, according to the Ohio History Connection. For now, he 
still retains his seat in the GOP-led legislature. Remaining members of Householder's leadership 
team had said he deserves the presumption of innocence but that he `lost the trust of his 
colleagues and the public' and couldn't effectively lead the House." 
The Circleville (OH) Herald (7/30, Pavloff, 19K) reports, "Prior to the indictment, 61-year-
old Householder, of Glenford, along with four other individuals and a 501(c)(4), Generation 
Now, were previously charged in a criminal complaint that was first unsealed on July 21. The 
criminal complaint document alleged the enterprise conspired to violate a racketeering statute 
through honest services wire fraud, receipt of millions of dollars in bribes and money 
laundering. Along with Householder the other four individuals charged in the indictment include 
Mathew Borges of Bexley, 48; Jeffrey Longstreth of Columbus, 44; Neil Clark of Columbus, 67; 
and Juan Cespedes of Columbus, 40. Householder's social welfare organization, Generation 
Now, was also charged in the indictment." 
The Columbus (OH) Dispatch (7/30, Ludlow, 367K) reports, "Following passage of House 
Bill 6, `the team' gathered that night to celebrate with House Speaker Larry Householder. 
Among the celebrants, according to a federal criminal complaint, was `Representative 3,' whom 
The Dispatch has identified as Republican Rep. Jamie Callender of Concord in Lake County, east 
of Cleveland. He was one of the measure's two sponsors." The Dispatch adds, "Before the 53-43 
`yes' vote on May 29, 2019, a media campaign financed by `dark money' urged voters to 
contact their representatives and tell them to support the $1 billion bailout of two nuclear 
plants along Lake Erie. FirstEnergy, whose subsidiary owned the two facilities, had wired $9.5 
million to Generation Now, a nonprofit authorities say was controlled by Householder and run 
by Jeff Longstreth, to pay for the media blitz and provide `cover' for reluctant House members, 
the complaint states."
