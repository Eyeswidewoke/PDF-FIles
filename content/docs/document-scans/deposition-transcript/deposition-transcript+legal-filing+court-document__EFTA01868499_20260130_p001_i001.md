Subject: 
Swanson and 1220 
Dan Swanson asked me to talk to you about lending money against 1220 South Ocean. 
1220 is owned by a single asset LLC owned by Dan (or in a joint tenancy with his wife, Karen). 
He is looking for a new $10 million second to refinance the existing $5.332.695.25 second mortgage loan that 
has been in place since January 2011. Before January 2011 there was no second. The new second would be 
junior to the existing first mortgage loan(s) held by TD Bank (successor to Mercantile) now totaling $21.200,000 
but which he would pay down to $20,200,000 out of the proceeds of the new second. TD extended the due date 
of the first until October 30. 2011 (when the existing second was put on) and Dan thinks TD will further extend it 
until Spring/Summer 2012 with an additional paydown. The existing second matures in January 2012. 
Basically, he is seeking another selling season. 
This is his proposed use of proceeds: 
Principal reduction on TD first 
$1,000,000 
Interest reserve for first (to July 31, 2012) 
800,000 
Reserve for 2011 real property taxes 
200,000 
Pay off existing second 
5.332.693 
Closing costs of refinancing 
200,000 
Reserve for maintenance, insurance and 
other bits for 1220 
1,000,000 
For "Dan to live on" 
1,467,307 
Obviously, there is play in this. 
We did not discuss interest rates or any other financial terms. 
The existing second mortgage lender is New Providence Capital Management Partners II Limited (NPCM), a 
Bahamian international business company, with an address in Nassau. It is controlled by David Kosoy, a 
Canadian who has been dabbling in Palm Beach real estate for 20 years and who has a piece of the Royal 
Poinciana Plaza along with Lee Munder. Dan said the interest rate is In the fives". It is due in January 2012-
academic since the first is due October 30. 2011. The subordination agreement between NPCM and TD 
prohibits any current payment of principal or interest on the second while the first is outstanding. I assume there 
was a reserve or discount to compensate for this. It does not appear that Dan personally guaranteed the 
second. 
I think (but don't know) that Dan found Kosoy through Jim McCann who has had some dealing over the years 
with Kosoy. Kosoy is a Toronto based real estate developer who buys distressed real estate and value adds(The 
Sterling Companies/Steding Centrecorp) and NPCM is a mortgage fund he founded in the Bahamas in 2007 
and runs. He was also involved in buying a bank in the Turks and Caicos. 
Dan is very uncomfortable with Kosoy. He says he regrets borrowing from Kosoy who "strung him along' "until 
he had no other altematives". I notice that he had to give NPCM a second mortgage on 210 Miraflores- a house 
and lot adjacent to the Phipps Estate lot on which Dan lives- as additional security for the second on 1220. 
Since, I don't think there is much more than $500,000 equity in 210 Miraflores, it seems that there was a hard 
bargain. 
Dan says that TD was very obliging in entering into an agreement (a Mortgage Subordination Agreement) but I 
read it and find it a strict subordination agreement, with several restrictions on what NPCM can do in the event of 
default. TD does give NPCM an option to buy the first for all amounts secured (including fees. advances and 
expenses) for a scant 10 days after notice of default. Nevertheless, TD asked for and got in exchange: a 
$998,000 principal paydown, a $1,041,379 interest reserve and a $137,849 tax reserve. (This was in January 
2011.) This correlates to the use of proceeds he provided above. TD also got Dan's wife, Karen, as a guarantor. 
Dan already is a guarantor. 
Dan has discussed a refi nancing of the NPC M second with TD and says that TD would welcome it but wants 
an additional $1 million paydown plus an interest and tax reserve similar to what TD required in January. 
Dan's Finances 
I did not ask him to explain his financial condition at this stage but it seems obvious that he is illiquid from his "no 
alternative" comment and his characterization of the $1,467,000 balance of the proposed loan proceeds as "for 
Dan to live on'. I also think he has a problematic net worth. 
His visible real assets seem to be: 
1220 South Ocean. He has reduced the price to $64,900,000 and now owes $26,600,000. "Survey says' a $40
