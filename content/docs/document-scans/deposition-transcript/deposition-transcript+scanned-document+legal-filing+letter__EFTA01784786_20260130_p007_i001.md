Oatman starts her article by explaining that fresh out of college and working as a unpaid intern for a San Francisco 
nonprofit, she paid the bills by moonlighting at an Indian restaurant in the Pacific Heights neighborhood. Her hostess 
job entailed long stretches of boredom punctuated by a cacophonous frenzy with more than the occasional icy glares 
from impatient diners and reprimands from managers for drifting from my podium. But compared with most restaurant 
workers, she was sitting pretty: 
as her hourly rate exceeded California's minimum wage and she was tipped out by the servers at the end of each shift, 
as well as receiving health care benefits — because they were a city mandate. 
But the truth is that very few of America's 11 million restaurant workers share her good fortune. Because the federal 
minimum wage is a paltry $7.25 an hour, but in 18 states servers, bussers, and hosts are paid just $2.13 =E2 which is 
less than the price of a Big Mac. This is known as the federal "'tipped minimum wage*" because, in theory, these food 
workers will make up the difference in tips. Twenty-five states and DC have their own slightly higher tipped minimums. 
The remaining seven, including California, guarantee the full state minimum wage to all workers.

*Some of the wages shown in the above map are only for large employers. 
*Oatman:* On the surface, tipping seems little more than a reward for astute recommendations and polite, speedy 
service. But the practice has unsavory roots, as Saru Jayaraman, a labor activist and author of *Forked: 
A New Standard for American Dining*, told me during a taping of Bite, the new food and politics podcast from Mother 
Jones. The origin of the word is unclear — one theory says "*tip*" is shorthand for "*to insure prom=tness*"; another 
suggests it's from 17th-century thief slang meaning "to give." In any case, European aristocrats popularized the habit of 
slipping gratuities to their hosts' servants, and by the mid-1800s rich Americans, hoping to flaunt their European 
sophistication, had brought the practice home. 
Restaurants and rail operators, notably Pullman, embraced tipping primarily, Jayaraman says, because it enabled them 
to save money by hiring newly freed slaves to work for tips alone. Plenty of Americans frowned upon the practice, and a 
union-led movement begat bans on tipping in several states. The fervor spread to Europe, too, before fizzling in the 
United States—by 1926, the state tipping bans had been repealed. 
America's first minimum-wage law, passed by Congress in 1938, allowed states to set a lower wage for tipped workers, 
but it wasn't until the '60s that labor advocates persuaded Congress to adopt a federal tipped minimum wage that 
increased in tandem with the regular minimum wage. In 1996, former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain, who was 
then head of the National Restaurant Association, helped convince a Republican-led Congress to decouple the two 
wages. The tipped minimum has been stuck at $2.13 ever since. 
This is why restaurant workers today take home some of the lowest pay offered by any industry. Seven of the 10 worst-
paying job categories tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are in food services. Real median wages for waiters 
and waitresses are down 5 percent since 2009; cooks saw a decline of 9 percent.

Sure, we occasionally hear about waiters hauling in $80K at posh urban establishments. Those are the stories that 
corporate players such as Darden, the notoriously stingy owner of the Olive Garden chain, want you to remember. The
