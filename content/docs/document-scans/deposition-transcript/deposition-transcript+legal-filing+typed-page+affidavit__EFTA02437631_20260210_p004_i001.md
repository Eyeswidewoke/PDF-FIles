international community confront a despotism that terrorizes its own people as they 
stand up for freedom? 
Will it take action against the dictators who stole an election in broad daylight and c 
down Iranian protesters who died in the streets choking in their own blood? Will the 
international community thwart the world's most pernicious sponsors and practitionr 
terrorism? 
Above all, will the international community stop the terrorist regime of Iran from de• 
atomic weapons, thereby endangering the peace of the entire world? 
The people of Iran are courageously standing up to this regime. People of goodwill 
the world stand with them, as do the thousands who have been protesting outside 
Will the United Nations stand by their side? 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
The jury is still out on the United Nations, and recent signs are not encouraging. Ra 
condemning the terrorists and their Iranian patrons, some here have condemned th 
victims. That is exactly what a recent UN report on Gaza did, falsely equating the ti 
with those they targeted. 
For eight long years, Hamas fired from Gaza thousands of missiles, mortars and ro 
nearby Israeli cities. Year after year, as these missiles were deliberately hurled at c 
civilians, not a single UN resolution was passed condemning those criminal attacks 
heard nothing — absolutely nothing — from the UN Human Rights Council, a misnan 
institution if there ever was one. 
In 2005, hoping to advance peace, Israel unilaterally withdrew from every inch of C 
dismantled 21 settlements and uprooted over 8,000 Israelis. We didn't get peace. li 
got an Iranian backed terror base fifty miles from Tel Aviv. Life in Israeli towns and 
next to Gaza became a nightmare. You see, the Hamas rocket attacks not only cor 
they increased tenfold. Again, the UN was silent. 
Finally, after eight years of this unremitting assault. Israel was finally forced to resp 
how should we have responded? Well, there is only one example in history of thou: 
rockets being fired on a country's civilian population. It happened when the Nazis rr 
British cities during World War II. During that war, the allies leveled German cities, 
hundreds of thousands of casualties. Israel chose to respond differently. Faced wilt 
enemy committing a double war crime of firing on civilians while hiding behind civil 
Israel sought to conduct surgical strikes against the rocket launchers. 
That was no easy task because the terrorists were firing missiles from homes and s 
using mosques as weapons depots and ferreting explosives in ambulances. Israel, 
contrast, tried to minimize casualties by urging Palestinian civilians to vacate the tE 
areas. 
We dropped countless flyers over their homes, sent thousands of text messages ar 
thousands of cell phones asking people to leave. Never has a country gone to such 
extraordinary lengths to remove the enemy's civilian population from harm's way. 
Yet faced with such a clear case of aggressor and victim• who did the UN Human F 
Council decide to condemn? Israel. A democracy legitimately defending itself agair 
is morally hanged, drawn and quartered, and given an unfair trial to boot. 
By these twisted standards, the UN Human Rights Council would have dragged Ro
