excluded from the Pershing lottery process. 
Pershing initiates the lottery process by identifying the accounts holding the called security. the total par value of the called securities held, and the trading unit of the security. 
Example (unit of trade = $25,000): 
Client Account: ABC-123234; Par Value: $100,000; Number of Trading Units: 4 
Client Account: DEF-325465; Par Value: $75,000; Number of Trading Units: 3 
Client Account: EDR-567433; Par Value: $150,000; Number of Trading Units: 6 
Client Account: EGT476574; Par Value: $50,000; Number of Trading Units: 2 
Client Account: EGT-888345; Par Value: $25,000; Number of Trading Units: 1 
Client Account: FRT-435234; Par Value: $25,000-, Number of Trading Unts: 1 
Client Account: FRT-658797; Par Value: $75,000-, Number of Trading Unts: 3 
In brief, the allocation process involves the following steps: 
> The number of trading units held n each account is identified. 
> A sequential number is assigned to each trading unit (e.g., account EDR-567433 would be assigned six numbers). 
> A random number is generated that will result in one of these trading units being the first unit in the selection process. 
> Thereafter, the trading units participating in the allocation are based on an incremental random number technique until the number of trading units allocated to Pershing is exhausted. 
Additional Information 
The allocation of called securities is not made on a pro-rata basis. Therefore, it is possible that a client may receive a full or partial redemption of shares held. Conversely, it is also possible that a client may not 
have any securities selected for redemption at all. 
When a partial cal is deemed favorable to the holders of the called security, Pershing wil exclude certain accounts from the lottery. Excluded accounts will include Pershing's proprietary and employee accounts, 
as well as proprietary and employee accounts of introducing broker-dealers (if Pershing carries and clears those accounts). No allocation wit be made to these proprietary and employee accounts until all other 
client positions at Pershing in such securities have been called. Wien a partial call is deemed unfavorable to holders of the called security. Pershing wil not exclude any accounts from the lottery. 
If the partial call is made at a price above the current market price as captured in Pershing's price reporting system. Pershing will generally categorize the partial call as one that is favorable to the holders of such 
security. If the partial call is made at a price that is equal to or below the current market price of the security as captured in Pershing's price reporting system, Pershing will generally categorize that call as one 
that is unfavorable to holders of the security. 
Clients have the right to withdraw uncalled, fully paid securities from Pershing at any time prior to the cutoff date and time established by the issuer, transfer agent and/or depository with respect to the partial cal. 
Clients also have the right to withdraw excess margin securities, provided that the client account is not subject to restriction under Regulation T or that such withdrawal wil not cause an under-margined condition.
