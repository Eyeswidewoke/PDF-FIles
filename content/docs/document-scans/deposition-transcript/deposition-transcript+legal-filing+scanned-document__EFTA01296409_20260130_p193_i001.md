1 We will not consider appellant's additional assignments of error presented for the first time in his reply brief. State v. tuner. 
10th Dist. No. 13AP-875, 2014-Ohio-2787. M.1. citing Hanlin•Reinaldi Constr. Corp. v. Jeepers. Inc.. 10th Dist. No. 03AP-851. 
2004-Ohio-6250. ¶ 22 ( g-IN1j '(A) reply brief is merely an opporttnity to reply to the brief of appellee. ' ' ' A reply brief may not 
raise new assignments. which were omitted from appellant's original brief, especially where leave to file a new assignment was 
not sought from this court."). 
r P71 In this assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court lacked jurisdiction to 
sentence him because his judgment of conviction did not resolve the WUD charge. We 
disagree. 
r P8] The trial court clearly had subject-matter jurisdiction to sentence appellant after the 
jury found him guilty of ["4] aggravated murder and the attendant firearm specifications. 
State ex rel. Pruitt v. Donnelly, 129 Ohio St.3d 498, 2011-Ohio-4203, ¶ 2, 954 N.E.2d 117, 
citing R.C. 2931.03; State v. Deresse, 5th Dist. No. 14-CA-31, 2014-Ohio-4234, ¶ 19. The 
only question is the significance of the trial courts failure to address the WUD charge. 
Appellant alleges that the failure renders his judgment of conviction void because it 
violated Crim.R. 32(C).2 We disagree. 
2 g-IN2] A judgment entry of conviction must follow Crim.R. 32(C) to be appealable. Stale v. Gwen. 134 Ohio St.3d 284.2012-
Ohio-5046. ¶ 20. 982 N.E.2d 626. citing State v. Baker. 119 Ohio St 3d 197. 2008-Ohio-3330. 893 N.E.2d 163. A final. 
appealable judgment entry of conviction must contain (1) the fact of the conviction. (2) the sentence, (3) the judge's signature, 
and (4) the time stamp indicating the entry upon the journal by the clerk. State v. Lester. 130 Ohio St.3d 303. 2011.Ohio-5204. 
958 N.E.2d 14Z paragraph one of the syllabus. Appellant does not dispute that his judgment of conviction satisfies these 
requirements as to his conviction for aggravated murder. 
[`P9] First, [HN3] noncompliance with Crim.R. 32(C) does not render a judgment of 
conviction void. State v. Pointer, 2d Dist. No. 24446, 2011-Ohio-5072, ¶ 22; State v. 
Staffrey, 7th Dist. No. 2011-Ohio-5760, 1127-29. Neither would it deprive the trial court of 
subject-matter jurisdiction. State v. Ervin, 8th Dist. No. 100366, 2014-Ohio-1631, 1113. 
This is so because the rule addresses the finality, not the validity, of the judgment of 
conviction. Id. Accordingly, res judicata bars appellant from raising this claim because he 
could have raised it in his direct appeal of his conviction. State v. Alexander, 5th Dist. No. 
2014CA00014, 2014-Ohio-2294, ¶ 15-16 (rejecting same argument on res judicata 
grounds). 
rioi Moreover, Crim.R. 32(C) - requires a full ("5] resolution of those counts for which 
there were convictions. It does not require a reiteration of those counts and specifications 
for which there were no convictions, but were resolved in other ways, such as dismissals, 
nolled counts, or not guilty findings."' State ex rel. Davis v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of 
Common Pleas, 127 Ohio St.3d 29, 2010-Ohio-4728, 112, 936 N.E.2d 41, quoting State ex 
rel. Davis v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, 8th Dist. No. 93814, 2010-Ohio-
1066, ¶ 8. Thus, because appellant was not convicted of the WUD charge, the trial courts 
failure to indicate the disposition of the WUD charge did not violate Crim.R. 32(C) or affect 
the finality of appellant's judgment of conviction. State v. Priest, 2d Dist. No. 25896, 2014-
Ohio-3843, 1113; State v. Moore, 7th Dist. No. 12 MA 197, 2013-Ohio-4000, ¶ 47.
