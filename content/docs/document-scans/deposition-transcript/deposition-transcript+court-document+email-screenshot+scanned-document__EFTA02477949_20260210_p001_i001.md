PLEASE READ CAREFULLY , 
In t=e spirit in which it is sent. our friendship is intact and solid , t=ough ,it has taken a hit. 
=div class="gmail_quote"> 
=C2 Mark was here this morning , the proposed transactions =re extremely complex . and would take a great deal of 
my detai=ed time. I do not know how, and even, if ,to move forward - . After =onths of hearing that you would have no 
problem paying a large fee if you =ould only ascertain value. The last transaction. a trans=ction which you saved over 
600 million in tax. declared bullet proof=by your attnys, and even if you want to disoccount for its =AO future 
realization, creating a savings of over 300 million =eal dollars. For some reason you chose to ignore our agr=ements 
verbal written and emailed -and at the very last minute , after t=e deal was complete decided that it was only worth 8 
million dollars=to you and your family. . ( assuming phaidon -richard happens.=there is a 24 m savings not including 
artspace and debt =rite down benefits- certain to come later .. IMPORTANT NOTE =br>: 
the phaidon transaction as 
currently contemp=ated will not work . WILL NOT !! 
=C2 When we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple times that i 
thought it was a very bad idea, in that I greatly preferred to have no financial=C2 interactions. I don't have many 
friends=and didn't want money in any way to interfere with our unique relationship. Reminder , = For five years you 
had the kind, but very goofy Eileen =lexandersson as the sole manager of your massive accounting , legal, investments. 
repor=ing, trusts etc. When I first told you in no uncertain terms that l=firmly believed she was incompetent you 
admonished me for " speaking out of=20 both sides of my mouth " . With regard Brad Wechsler=/span> , there has 
never been a " both sides. ". I h=ve consistantly maintained since day one that he was highly unsuited for the job. 
Wh=n you initially asked me to help convince him to take the role , promising him a position to manage mirage 
investments =AO I sent you a note saying that instead of hiring him you should pay up a=d get first class people. I have 
reiterated the same message for over a year now.. Brad , not me ,was tasked with hiring =ew people, according to his 
biz school org chart.(nauseating ) and as=you wanted him to take ownership of the staff,he conducted many interviews 
alone.. you may recall=that as late as may, you told him in my presence that though six months h=d passed he had not 
hired anyone. since then I hav= rectified errors in sales tax, use tax, income tax, fbar reporting, 1031 rep=rting, 8 
million of deductions missed errors of millions on th= returns. a cashflow that is misleading helped prepare financial
