Hi Jeremy!:) 
Yes, I think everything depends on what we feel inside of u=, how can we share love, 
kindness if we don't feel it? But sometimes i='s so hard to keep it, sometimes it's hard to find sense... What d= you think 
about it, what is the sense of your life in? Just interesting t= know:)

Hahaha...Old Man. You are funny! By the way, thank you so much for your cal=. 
I apologize for not recognizing your Russian, I'm not used to hearin= Russian being sung to me. I have another friend 
from Norway named Gunn wh= I thought it might have been since I've know her since I was 15 but t=en I heard you say 
'It is me, Karina' and my jaw almost dropped to=the floor. It was s000000 nice of you to call me and it put a smile on my 
=ace all day! :) 
The Christmas performance is going well. I have very few lines, which i= good. I 
get to start the whole thing off with a funny skit. It would be g=eat if you could see the play, it has a very important 
message in it too. = also get to be a 'wise man' who travels to Bethlehem to visit the=baby Jesus. 
Wow, it is really cold there! It is a beautiful 18 degrees C here. Plea=e don't get 
sick, that would be terrible. Take a lot of vitamins and p=enty of water!! 
Going to the gym! Sounds good. I need to start doi=g that too. My muscles are 
not strong like yours, mine are weak and small.=:( I'm sure you could beat me up if you had to. :) 
That's amazing that you went to a post-mortem examination. I'll=bet it was a bit 
strange seeing someone there who was no longer living. l&=39;m sure it does make you think about your life and what it 
all means. I =hink this is why I believe what I do in Christianity where it isn't ab=ut doing good enough to hope I will 
make it to heaven, but to accept Chris= in my heart. Because I believe Jesus died for my sins and he has already =aken 
away any of the guilt or blame in my life when he died on the cross a=d now I can live a life believing that I will go to 
heaven not because l&#=9;ve been good enough but because I accept and acknowledge Jesus as the on=y one who can 
save me from the other place I could go. It's a happy thrught to know I am saved from such a place. It's also why I love 
being = part of much church and the friends that I have there because they aren8d4=93 'trying' to be good, they are just 
full of love and encouragem=nt because they themselves have been saved. I hope I am making sense. This=is the first 
time in a long time that I have tried to describe my faith.
