The bank set a hearing for summary judgement that was continued to Oct=7 when Trent injured his hand. I gave my 
documents to trent because =he bank never told me they were changing the terms of the loan from a cons=ruction loan 
to a simple line of credit. Thye did this on the day of closi=g. This allowed Mike to take over $290,000.00 within 6 days 
of getti=g the loan, and more over the next 18 months. Trent then suggested t=ru his paralegal that bankruptcy may be 
the way to go. I met with Le=nne (paralegal) and she gave me a packet for the bankruptcy lawyer in Tren='s office. 
Everyone had been telling me that joint accounts are unto=chable, but then it was asked if they were tennets by the 
entirety. =hen I checked, my bank accounts aand Transamerica stock account were all "=oint with rights of suvivorship." 
This is neither tennets in common =r by the entirety (seems financial institutions got tired of beinf dragged into legal 
spats and created this designation). I called the=broker/advisor on the transamerica account & he said it is 100% 
access=ble in a judgement. I had him transfer the account into a tennets by=teh entirety account last week. I asked if 
there is a prohibition or=time limit on when I can transfer money before filing bankruptcy and appar=ntly no lawyer at 
Trent's office knows. I have about $300,000.00 in =ash in 2 checking accounts and 1 money market account. I wnat to 
put=in in the Transamerica account because it is tennets by the entirety now.&=bsp; Seems like a simple answer do me 
if you do bankruptcy, but appa=ently they will not answer. Now time is running out so I told Trent =o file the response 
to the summaary judgement so that we can argue for a t=ial. Otherwise, the judge will graant a summary judgement & 
they=start freezing accounts. Lawyers. If they don't know what they are doing, why don't they just say so? Would save 
a lot of=time. Also, I wouldd have converted accounts or shifted money years =go if they had not told me everything 
was safe. Hope I don't end up =osing $1.8 million in joint money now. That wipes me and Karen out.&=bsp; She doesn't 
deserve to lose everything because of me. 
We'll see. I am going to try to get bankruptcy advice today, but=l have 2 depo's that will take all morning and most of 
the afternoon so it=will be difficult. Hope I don't run out of time. 
I sent a blind copy to you so you'd know what is happening. =We may have our answer in 2 weeks whether I want it or 
not.
