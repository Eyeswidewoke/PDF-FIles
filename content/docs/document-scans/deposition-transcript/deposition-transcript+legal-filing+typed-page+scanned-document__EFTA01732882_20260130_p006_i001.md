While still a fugitive, Chalabi head=d the executive council of the INC, an umbrella Iraqi opposition group cre=ted in 1992 
for the purpose of fomenting the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.=C240 The INC received major funding and assistance 
from the United States= Chalabi was involved in organizing a resistance movement among Kurd= in northern Iraq in the 
early mid-1990s. When that effort was crush=d and hundreds of his supporters were killed, Chalabi fled the 
country4=A0 Chalabi lobbied in Washington for the passage of the Iraq Liberation Ac= (passed October 1998). This 
earmarked US$97 million to support Iraqi oppo=ition groups. During the period from March 2000 to September 2003, 
t=e U.S. State Department paid nearly $33 million to the INC, according to a=General Accounting Office report released 
in 2004, in addition to tens of =illions of black ops funding. 
Before the Iraq War (2=03), Chalabi enjoyed close political and business relationships with some =embers of the U.S. 
government, including some prominent neoconservatives w=thin the Pentagon. Chalabi was said to have had political 
contacts w=thin the Project for the New American Century, most notably with Paul Wolf=witz, a student of nuclear 
strategist Albert Wohlstetter, and Richard Perl=. He also enjoyed considerable support among politicians and politic.' 
pundits in the United States, most notably Jim Hoagland of The Washingto= Post, who held him up as a notable force for 
democracy in Iraq. He =as a special guest of First lady Laura Bush at the 2004 State of the Union=Address. 
Although the CIA was largely skeptical of C=alabi and the INC, information allegedly from his group (most famously fro= 
a defector codenamed "Curveball") made its way into inte=ligence dossiers used by President George W. Bush and 
British Prime Minist=r Tony Blair to justify an invasion of Iraq. "Curveball",=Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, fed officials 
hundreds of pages of bogus &quo=;firsthand" descriptions of mobile biological weapons factorie= on wheels and rails. 
Secretary of State Colin Powell later used thi= information in a U.N. presentation trying to garner support for the war, 
=espite warnings from German intelligence that "Curveball"=was fabricating claims. Since then, the CIA has admitted 
that the de=ector made up the story, and Powell said in 2011 the information should no= have been used in his 
presentation. 
As U.S. forces =ook control during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, Chalabi returned under their=aegis and was given a position 
on the Iraq interim governing council by th= Coalition Provisional Authority. He served as president of the coun=il in 
September 2003. He denounced a plan to let the UN choose an in=erim government for Iraq. "We are grateful to 
President Bush=for liberating Iraq, but it is time for the Iraqi people to run their affa=rs," he was quoted as saying in The 
New York Times. 1= August 2003, Chalabi was the only candidate whose unfavorable ratings exc=eded his favorable 
ones with Iraqis in a State Department poll. In a surve= of nearly 3,000 Iraqis in February 2004 (by Oxford Research 
International, sponsored by the BBC in =he United Kingdom, ABC in the U.S., ARD of Germany, and the NHK in 
Japan<Apan>), only 0.2 percent of respondents said he was the most t=ustworthy leader in Iraq. A secret document 
written in 2002 by the British=Overseas and Defense Secretariat reportedly described Chalabi as "= convicted fraudster 
popular on Capitol Hill." 
In response to the WMD controversy, Chalabi told London's Daily Tel=graph in February 2004, "We are heroes in error. 
As far as w='re concerned, we've been entirely successful. That tyrant Saddam =s gone and the Americans are in
