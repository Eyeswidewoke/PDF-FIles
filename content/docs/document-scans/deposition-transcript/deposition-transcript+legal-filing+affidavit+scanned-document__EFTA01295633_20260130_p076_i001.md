One is further left to wonder where the majority's new imagined-coercion-based rule 
comes from. Generally, the purportedly ["144] "coercive nature of the employer-
employee relationship . . . is insufficient to demonstrate that . . . [employer-employee] 
interviews were improper." Slavinski v. Columbia Ass'n, Inc., No. CCB-08-890, 2011 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 33729, 2011 WL 1310256, at *4 (D. Md. Mar. 30, 2011) (collecting cases); 
accord Maddock v. KB Homes, Inc., 248 F.R.D. 229, 237 (C.D. Cal. 2007); McLaughlin v. 
Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 224 F.R.D. 295, 298 (D. Mass. 2004); cf. Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, 452 
U.S. 89, 104, 101 S. Ct. 2193, 68 L. Ed. 2d 693 (1981) ("[T]he mere possibility of abuses 
does not justify routine adoption of a communications ban[]"). Certainly it cannot be found 
in the cases the majority cites, which all raised questions about defendants who contacted 
putative class plaintiffs after a class action had been filed. Here, Nucor investigated and 
obtained affidavits before any lawsuit was filed, so it could not have been attempting to 
break up the class -- the class did not even exist yet. The majority's cases also involved a 
level of egregious misconduct not found in this case, suggesting that those cases were 
directed at a problem that does not exist here. See, e.g., Kleiner v. First Nat'l Bank of 
Atlanta, 751 F.2d 1193, 1197-98 (11th Cir. 1985) (finding unilateral contacts improper 
where counsel violated direct court order and conducted a vast "selling job" seeking class 
opt-outs in "[s]ecrecy and haste" during "the district judge's vacation"); see also Burrow v. 
Sybaris Clubs Intl Inc., No. 13 C 2342, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148576, 2014 WL 5310525, 
at *4-5 (N.D. III. Oct 17, 2014) (summarizing many of the same cases and concluding that 
they "depict[ed] communications so extreme that they actually cut against [the ["145] 
majority's present] position"). 
We also need not speculate about "potential" coercion, as the circumstances make plain 
that Nucor did not coerce its employees into making positive statements. No employee has 
claimed that the affidavits were coercive. No employee has suggested that Nucor 
retaliated against employees who complained of discrimination. And the contents of the 
affidavits do not imply coercion either. Employees evidently felt free to speak honestly, as 
the affidavits were not universally favorable to Nucor. See, e.g., J.A. 10950 (district court 
noting that the affidavits "actually bolstered the plaintiffs' claims of a common hostile work 
environment"). Some employees also chose not to give statements at all. See, e.g., J.A. 
6911. And still other employees made handwritten corrections to their typed affidavits, 
indicating that the employees had complete control over their statements. See, e.g., J.A. 
6120. 
What is more, Nucor gave each employee a written notice explaining that the interview 
was voluntary, that the interviews were being taken on behalf of the company, that 
employees could decline to participate, and that they would not face any retaliation for 
what they said. ["146] See, e.g., J.A. 6003. In other contexts, the Court has said that 
disclosures like these prevent coercion. See, e.g., Overnite Transp. Co. v. NLRB, 280 F.3d 
417, 434 (4th Cir. 2002). Each employee who chose to participate then signed an 
acknowledgement and noted in his or her affidavit that Nucor did not coerce the employee. 
See, e.g., J.A. 6003. 
The majority nevertheless condemns Nucor for not informing the employees that the 
company might use their statements p953] in litigation. This novel requirement -- a sort of 
"civil Miranda rule" — seems an odd one given that litigation had not been filed. Instead, 
interviewees were accurately informed that "[t]here ha[d] been a few charges of
