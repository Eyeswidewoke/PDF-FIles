Subject: you should keep this email 
I have tried but not succeeded in trying to teach you, guide you, empower you. I have 
asked that you read some of the great books so that your conversation would be 
based on more than yahoo news and tv talk shows. I have not succeeded.. I had 
asked that you keep in shape and learn to cook, i have not succeeded. to learn to 
taste not only food but distingusih quality from the commonplance. The things that 
you write that have broken our relationship are not the things that you have done are 
right but the things that have been wrong. I tried to teach you a different way of life, 
beautiful things, elegant and unusual ideas. and introduced you to a life that few get 
to see. Your needs as you describe them center on what I should not do. It is pretty 
simple, without a realtionship with you. I would have been able to do more„ and 
without our relationship you would have been able to do much less. You need to 
seek advice elsewhere. Get professional guidance. I love you and hope that 
someone holds your behavior up to you so you can see for yourself.

head. with filthy blankets. to be able to see you. but jenn kissed me hello in front of 
henry , Many nights I went to jail early, to avoid more aggravation. what happened to 
laughing at silly things. playing , pleasure. all took a back seat to , Jenn, brice, 
dana, nanny, svet, the monitor. watch movies alone, no naps, no hugswith anyone 
but you. 
negative negative .. ITs all in the emails. I had to stop asking for you to 
make breakfast , seperate from the one valdson sandswich /Igor would always bring 
something, our time was very limited, and still , often you complained about 
someone. you said that I still hired dana„ did you think that dana never again 
traveled with us. nevr, why„ because you didn't want it.. if someone made me laugh, 
they were soon history.
