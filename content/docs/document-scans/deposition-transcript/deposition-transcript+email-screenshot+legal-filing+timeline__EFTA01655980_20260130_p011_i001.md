two years in prison for threatening an FBI agent he allegedly believed was not responding to crimes he

pleaded guilty in February to a charge of influencing, impeding or retaliating against a federal official by threat. The 
article mentioned that in December 2023, Howell approached FBI Special Agent Randy Copley at Copley's Pike 
County residence and told the agent he wanted to report a crime. Copley, the complaint said, told Howell to 
contact the FBI's toll-free number to report the crime and Howell thanked Copley and left his residence. However, 
according to the complaint, in March, Copley observed Howell drive by his residence and found that his mailbox 
was heavily damaged and there was a large metal pipe extending from the mailbox, along with a note which said, 
"You've got mail. Guess who. It's not a game. It's people's (lives)." The article added that the complaint said that 
Copley was able to link the note, which was on a receipt, to Howell through Howell's employer and he spoke with 
Howell, who admitted to damaging the agent's mailbox and leaving the note and pipe in the mailbox.
