after the cure period but before the actual termination of the lease, that that could 
constitute a waiver in light of the very clear nonwaiver clause in the lease." (Tr. at 39). 
I reserved decision, however, on the following issues: (1) whether the lease 
unambiguously required that OFM's consent to an assignment or sublet be in writing, in 
which case Massey could not have orally consented, as a matter of law, to Epstein's 
sublet of the Premises to Fisher, (2) whether OFM was permitted under the lease to 
unreasonably withhold consent to Epstein's consent to a sublet to Fisher, or whether it 
was bound by an implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing, and (3) whether, 
assuming the latter, OFM in fact withheld its consent unreasonably. 
*5 Finally, I ordered Epstein to pay into an escrow fund eight days' worth of the 
$15,000 rent for the month of August 1996 and an additional $15,000 for September 
1996 (because OFM had already accepted his tender of rent through August 23, 1996, 
and Epstein had collected rent from Fisher through September 30, 1996). Additionally, 
I ordered Fisher to pay into the fund $15,000 per month, beginning October 1, 1996 to 
date, and continuing for each month thereafter. 
2. The Governments Addition of the Subtenants as Defendants 
In the course of discovery on its claims for relief against Epstein and Fisher, the 
Government learned that Fisher had further sublet the Premises to the Subtenants, 
also without the prior written consent of OFM. The Government then sought leave to 
amend the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 to name the 
Subtenants as additional defendants in the action. I granted the Government's motion 
on the record at the December 17, 1997 oral argument. The Government thereafter 
filed a second amended complaint and served a copy on each of the Subtenants. 
In an effort to settle the case, I held a conference on January 28, 1998. At the 
conclusion of that conference, the Government requested permission to file a motion 
seeking partial summary judgment against the Subtenants. By stipulation and order 
dated March 5, 1998, all of the named Subtenants, except for Diane Fisher d/b/a The 
Fisher Group and Ron Soffer, agreed to be bound by any order I entered with respect 
to Fishers right to occupy the Premises. On March 13, 1998, after the Government 
submitted its motion, Diane Fisher executed the stipulation and order, also agreeing to 
be bound. To date, Soffer still has not executed the stipulation. Hence, the 
Government's motion for summary judgment against the Subtenants is still pending 
with respect to Soffer only. 
DISCUSSION 
A. Standards for Summary Judgment 
The standards applicable to motions for summary judgment are well-settled. A 
court may grant summary judgment only where there is no genuine issue of material 
fact and the moving party is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See 
Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Accordingly, the court's task is not to "weigh the evidence and 
determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for 
trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 
202 (1986). Summary judgment is inappropriate if, resolving all ambiguities and 
drawing all inferences against the moving party, id. at 255 (citing Adickes v. S.H. Kress 
& Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-59, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970)), there exists a 
dispute about a material fact "such that a reasonable jury could retum a verdict for the 
nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
