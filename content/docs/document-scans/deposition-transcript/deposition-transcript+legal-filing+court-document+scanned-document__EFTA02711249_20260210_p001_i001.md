FOREWORD: EVER BROCKMAN 
SINCE Mt 1960s, John BroclunanaTms pioneering activities have been diverse and multidirectional, marked by a fearlessness and 
fluidity of thought. He has been a writer, a literary agent, a junction-maker between science and art, a curator, an avant-garde-
film programmer, has worked in industry, for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and for the White House. He is also the founder of 
Edge Foundation and editor of Edge.org, an important platform for the exchange of knowledge between different fields that 
aims ficeto arrive at the edge of the worldaTMs knowledge.a 
Stewart Brand has called Brockman an aceintellectual enzyme . . . an adroit enabler of otherwise impossible things.fi As 
Brockman himself puts it, ace' look to . . . those who through their empirical work are changing the nature of ourselves and 
reality, whether they are scientists or not . . . people who are using technology and new communications ideologies to 
radically reboot the whole idea of human communications First and foremost, he is driven by the question: ficeWho 
. will 
take us to the epistemological crossroads where everything has to be rethought? My entire career has been in pursuit of this 
vision.ii 
Central to this approach is BrockmanaTMs fundamental opposition to the separation of art and science. Instead, he sees art as 
science and science as art. This way of thinking beyond the boundaries is a guiding theme that defines his activities, which 
focus on establishing networks ficewhose authority was derived from their persona and their ideas, not from their institutions.fi 
He ficecelebrates thinking smart versus the anesthesiology of wisdom,fi where experts ask questions not ficein front of their 
peers in their academic discipline or their field, [but] in front of people who are their equals in other areas.fi This is why, when 
I first met him in the summer of 1998 at his rural farm in Connecticut, he became one of my great inspirations, reinforcing my 
conviction that pooling knowledge across disciplines is the future. 
In one of our many conversations over the last fifteen years, Brockman remarked that ficeLife is the theatre of one chance.fi 
His life and work have been greatly informed by this idea. In 1964, he met the artist and filmmaker Jonas Mekas, who was 
running the Film-makersaTM Cinematheque for underground cinema. Brockman was already working with underground film-
makers, and video artists, which was at this time a revolutionary art genre. In 1965 Mekas invited him to take over the 
Cinematheque and to initiate an Expanded Cinema Festival there. He invited many great New York artists working in all 
fields, including Nam June Paik, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Whitman, and Claes Oldenburg, to make a 
work integrating film for a special performance. These activities led to an invitation from leading scientists in biophysics, 
computation and cybernetics to bring a group of New York artists, filmmakers and musicians to MIT in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, for what was probably the first art-science symposiumran event that would have a lasting impact on his 
thinking and methods. 
Out of his experiences in the avant-garde art world of New York, BrockmanaTMs writings were quickly evolving. His first 
book, By The Late John Brockman (1969), was introduced in 1968 as part of a six-evening avant-garde program at the 
Poetry Center at the 92nd St Y in New York. Preceding and following Brockman on the program, respectively, were 
evenings by John Cage and Jorge Luis Borges. 
This was the era of ficeThe Living Theatre,fi of Antonin AnaudaTMs ficetheatre of cruelty,fi and the management of the Poetry 
Center had trepidations about BrockmanaTMs event, and rightly so. BrockmanaTMs acereading,fi a performance piece 
orchestrated in collaboration with Ken DeweyaTMs Theatre X and artist group USCO, was an attack on the values of the 
Poetry Center itself. The evening turned into a riotous affairrenraged audience members stopped the show five times, 
closing the curtains, stealing the scripts, harassing the performers, turning off the lights. 
By The Late John Brockman, his second book, 37 (1971), and a third book intended as volume three of the trilogy, were 
published together in a paperback in 1973 under the title Afterwords. They were a response to the idea of cybernetics. The 
first looks at all human theory through the lens of information theory; the second examines HeisenbergaTMs theory of 
indeterminacy, and the third investigates the limits of words as tools for understanding. 
When Heinz von Foerster, an architect of cybernetics, along with Warren McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, and John von 
Neumann, reviewed the trilogy in 1973, he commented: 
Brockman takes the mystery of language and puts it right back into its own mystery; that is, he ex-plains the mystery of 
language by taking language out (a`ex-aTM) of the plane of its mystery, so as to become visible to all before it slips back into 
its plane. This in itself is a remarkable achievement that has been denied to almost all linguists, for they stick to the
