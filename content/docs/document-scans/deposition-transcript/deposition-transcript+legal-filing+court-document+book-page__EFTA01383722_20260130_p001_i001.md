Mobileye in accordance with applicable Dutch procedures, such that a depositary on behalf of non-
tendering Mobileye shareholders will, immediately following the consummation of the Asset Sale. 
receive the Offer Consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) (the "Second 
Step Distribution") or (b) commencing a statutory proceeding before the Enterprise Chamber 
(Ondernemingskanrer) of the Amsterdam Court of Appeals (Geredushof Amsterdam) (the "Dutch 
Court") for the compulsory acquisition (uakoopprocedure) of non-tendered shares as provided by 
Dutch law (the "Compulsory Acquisition"). If the Compulsory Acquisition is implemented. then the 
Dutch Court will determine the price to be paid for the non-tendered Shares. Although Intel and 
Purchaser will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the per Share price paid in the Compulsory 
Acquisition for the non-tendered Shares to be equal to the Offer Consideration, such price may be 
greater than, equal to. or less than the Offer Consideration. Such price may potentially be increased by 
statutory interest ("Dutch Statutory Interest") accrued at the rate applicable in The Netherlands 
(currently two percent per annum). The period for the calculation of the Dutch Statutory Interest would 
begin either (i) on the date on which the Offer Consideration became payable to Mobileye shareholders 
who tendered their Shares to Purchaser in the Offer (the 'Offer Payment Date"), provided that 
Purchaser has acquired at least 959E of Mobileye's issued capital (geplaarsr kapiutal) as of the Offer 
Payment Date or (ii) under certain circumstances. including when Purchaser has not acquired at least 
95% of Mobileye's issued capital (geplaarsr kapiraal) as of the Offer Payment Date, from the date 
when the Dutch Court renders a judgment allowing the claim for the Compulsory Acquisition against 
the non-tendering shareholders for all of their Mobileye Shares. The end of the period for the 
calculation of the Dutch Statutory Interest would be the date we pay for the Shares then owned by the 
non-tendering Mobileye shareholders.
