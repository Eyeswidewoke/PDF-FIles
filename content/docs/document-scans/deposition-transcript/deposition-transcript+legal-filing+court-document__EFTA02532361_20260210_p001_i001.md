Hi Jeffrey, 
Sometimes when I write you I feel like I am talking t= myself. It's ok, I understand that you are busy. 
I am rocking =t with real estate. I have a few deals in the works and a couple of great =deas for advertising. 
Between me and my intern we will walk all the buildi=gs in gramercy and east village and get the management company 
of every bu=lding (the phone number is legally required to be in the lobby). We will c=ll and ask tosend us listings. I will 
also have her put the flyer I create= in colleges and language schools. This should get some calls. 
I met a really great guy. His name is M. He is a millionaire and has=a real estate company. He is one of the 
nicest, most repectful, humble, in=elligent and smart people I ever met. I had a great time with him and I am=going out 
with him again tomorrow. It feels like we have know each other f=r years. 
I am also helping 
get a green card. I am very excited about it. = am happy I can do something that is very 
important to her. She is a very =pecial talented person and I want her to have the best opportunities. 
This week I am going to Life Coaching Business development seminar with=some of the people from my 
company. I am very excited. It's a seminar =y Tony Robbins. I have been following his teachings for years, that's =ow I got 
your attention. If it wasn't for his advice I would not last =ore than a week with you. It is really great than my company is 
encourengi=g me to go. I believe it up my production level by 70% or more. Great stu=f. 
I saw Henry the other day. He seems distressed and like he really needs=a hug. I wish I could do something to 
make him feel better. He has been an=amazing friend to me. Basically he made sure I was ok until you are back. = want 
to give something back to him, but I don't know what it is. 
I am really happy at work. I love the girl I am working with (). 
=he does all the annoing things I don't like to 
do and helps me close d=als. She is very warm and is great at connecting with clients. I paid for =er to go to the seminar 
with me because I thought it was crucial to our bu=iness and she send me such a nice email telling me how happy she 
was to ha=e me in her life. That made my day. 
All good with me. Pretty happy right now. I just wish I could share it =ith you, because I really think of you as my 
family. You gave me a great f=undation and I am forever grateful. 
Wish you a happy halloween! 
Big kiss
