• THE AMOUNT PAYABLE ON THE NOTES IS NOT LINKED TO THE LEVEL OF THE 
REFERENCE ASSET AT ANY TIME OTHER THAN THE 
FINAL VALUATION DATE — The Final Level will be based on the Official Closing 
Level of the Reference Asset on the Final Valuation Date, subject to 
postponement for non-trading days and certain market disruption events. Even 
if the level of the Reference Asset appreciates during the term of the 
Notes other than on the Final Valuation Date but then drops on the Final 
Valuation Date to a level that is less than the Initial Level, the Payment at 
Maturity may be less, and may be significantly less, than it would have been 
had the Payment at Maturity been linked to the level of the Reference Asset 
prior to such decrease. Although the actual level of the Reference Asset on 
the Maturity Date or at other times during the term of the Notes may be 
higher than the Final Level, whether a Knock-Out Even has occurred and the 
Payment at Maturity will be based solely on the Official Closing Level of the 
Reference Asset on the Final Valuation Date. 
• YOUR MAXIMUM GAIN ON THE NOTES IS LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM RETURN - If the 
Final Level is greater than the Initial Level, for each 
$1,000 Principal Amount of Notes you hold, you will receive at maturity 
$1,000 plus an additional amount that will not exceed the Maximum Return of 
17% 
of the Principal Amount, regardless of the appreciation in the Reference 
Asset, which may be significantly greater than the Maximum Return. YOU WILL 
NOT RECEIVE A RETURN ON THE NOTES GREATER THAN THE MAXIMUM RETURN. 
• THE NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO THE CREDIT RISK OF HSBC USA INC. — The Notes are 
senior unsecured debt obligations of the Issuer, HSBC, and 
are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. As 
further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus, 
the Notes will rank on par with all of the other unsecured and 
unsubordinated debt obligations of HSBC, except such obligations as may be 
preferred by 
operation of law. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any return 
of principal at maturity, depends on the ability of HSBC to satisfy its 
obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived 
creditworthiness of HSBC may affect the market value of the Notes and, in 
the event 
HSBC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive the amounts 
owed to you under the terms of the Notes. 
• SUITABILITY OF THE NOTES FOR INVESTMENT — You should only reach a decision 
to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your 
advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment 
objectives and the information set out in this pricing supplement. Neither 
HSBC nor any 
dealer participating in the offering makes any recommendation as to the 
suitability of the Notes for investment. 
• CERTAIN BUILT-IN COSTS ARE LIKELY TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE 
NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY — While the Payment at 
Maturity described in this pricing supplement is based on the full Principal 
Amount of your Notes, the original issue price of the Notes includes the 
placement agent's commission and the estimated cost of hedging our 
obligations under the Notes through one or more of our affiliates. As a
