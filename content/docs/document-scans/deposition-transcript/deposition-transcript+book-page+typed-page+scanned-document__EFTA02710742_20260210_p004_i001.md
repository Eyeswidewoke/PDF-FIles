back to the studio, and the next year, 1974, released another album, From the Mars Hotel. Not 
long after that album's release however, the Dead decided to take a hiatus from live touring. 
In September 1975 the Dead released their eighth studio album, Blues for Allah. Their hiatus 
was short-lived, though, as they resumed touring in June 1976. That same year, they re-signed 
with Arista Records. Their new contract soon produced Terrapin Station in 1977. Although 
things appeared to be going well for the band, problems were arising with their two newest 
members, Keith and Donna Jean Godchaux. While touring during the late 1970s the band 
began to use freebase cocaine. Donna frequently had excessive vocal issues while performing 
live, and Keith was becoming dependent on hard drugs. Both of those issues were causing 
complications with touring, and they agreed to leave the band in February 1979. 
Following the departure of the Godchauxs, Brent Mydland joined as keyboardist and vocalist 
and was considered "the perfect fit". The Godchauxs then formed the Heart of Gold Band before 
Keith Godchaux died in a car accident in 1980. Mydland was the keyboardist for the Grateful 
Dead for 11 years until his death by narcotics overdose in .July 1990435] becoming the third 
keyboardist to die. 
During the 198os the band transformed as the talents of Mydland helped power the group. 
Shortly after Mydland found his place in the early 1980s, Garcia's health began to decline. His 
drug habits caused him to lose his liveliness on stage. After kicking his drug habit in 1985, 
Garcia slipped into a diabetic coma for several days in July 1986. After he recovered, the band 
released In the Dark in 1987, which resulted as their best-selling studio album release, and also 
produced their only top-10 chart single, "Touch of Grey". Also that year, the group toured with 
Bob Dylan, as documented on the album Dylan & the Dead. 
Inspired by Garcia's improved health and a successful album, the band's energy and chemistry 
peaked in the late 1980s and 1990. Performances were vigorous and as a result, every show 
exceeded its maximum audience capacity. The band's "high time" came to a sudden halt when 
Mydland died after the summer tour in 1990. 
The band now had to rebuild; both Vince 
Welnick, former keyboardist for the Tubes, and Bruce Hornsby, who had a sucencful career 
with his own band the Range, joined the band on keyboards and vocals. Welnick joined as a 
proper member of the band and stayed with the band until Garcia's death, but he was never a 
member of the Other Ones or the Dead. He did, however, play in early incarnations of Ratdog 
with Bob Weir. Welnick died on June 2, 2006, reportedly a suicide. Hornsby was an unofficial 
member until March 24, 1992, and has participated in various post-Grateful dead projects, 
notably the Other Ones. 
Aftermath (1995 to the present) 
Following Garcia's death in August 1995, the remaining members formally decided to disband. 
Since that time however, there have been a number of reunions by the surviving members 
involving various combinations of musicians. 
In 1998, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with several other musicians, formed a 
band called the Other Ones, and performed a number of concerts that year, releasing a live 
album, The Strange Remain, the following year. In 2000, the Other Ones toured again, this time 
with Bill Kreutzmann but without Lesh. After taking another year off, the band was active again 
in 2002. With Lesh's return for this go-round, the Other Ones then included all four living 
former Grateful Dead members who had been in the band for most or all of its history.
