Amendment No. 3 to Form S-I 
Table of Contents 
Interest Rate Risk and Long-Term Debt 
We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the 
use of interest rate swaps (-Cash Flow Hedges"). Our risk management objective and strategy is to utilize these interest rate swaps to 
protect the company against adverse fluctuations in interest rates by reducing its exposure to variability in cash flows relating to interest 
payments on a portion of its outstanding debt. We believe that we are meeting our objectives of hedging our risks in changes in cash 
flows that are attributable to changes in the LIBOR rate, which is the designated benchmark interest rate being hedged (the 'hedged 
risk"), on an amount of the company's debt principal equal to the then-outstanding swap notional amount. 
Additionally, we had the Deal-Contingent Swap that was entered into on April 16, 2014 in order to reduce our exposure to 
anticipated variable rate debt issuances in connection with the Safeway acquisition. Upon consummation of the Safeway acquisition, the 
swap became effective and was designated as a cash flow hedge. In accordance with the swap agreement, we receive a floating rate of 
interest and pay a fixed rate of interest over the life of the contract. 
Interest rate volatility could also materially affect the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit 
Facilities. The interest rate we pay on future borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are dependent on LIBOR. We believe 
a 100 basis point increase or decrease on our variable interest rates would not be significant. 
See Note 7—Derivative Financial Instruments in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this prospectus, for 
additional information. 
The tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as Cash Flow Hedges, deal-contingent swaps 
and underlying debt portfolio as of February 28, 2015 (dollars in millions).

Commodity Price Risk 
We have entered into fixed price contracts to purchase electricity and natural gas for a portion of our energy needs. Contracts 
entered into as of February 28, 2015 expire from 2015 through 2034 with a combined contract value of $99.9 million. We expect to take 
delivery of these commitments in the normal course of business, and, as a result, these commitments qualify as normal purchases. We 
do not believe that these energy and commodity swaps would cause a material change to the financial position of the company.
