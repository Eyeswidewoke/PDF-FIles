that we're going to use teal names during this 
2 
deposition rather than pseudonyms. I just want to 
3 
make sure that we're all on the same page that when 
4 
the court reporter types it up, it's going to be 
5 
typed up in the transcript as the initials like we 
6 
have in previous depositions. 
7 
MR. CRITTON: That, that's fine, but keep in 
8 
mind that we need, because a number of the 
9 
individuals have multiple first initials and you 
10 
have used initials that don't even match your 
11 
clients names. 
12 
So we're going to have to — Cindy, you're 
13 
going to need to, ultimately when you finish, if 
14 
this is agreeable with everyone, I think we did 
15 
this before is type up a key and then you can give 
16 
that only to the lawyers and do that as just a 
17 
privileged or as a confidential document, so that 
18 
we can insert those 
19 
MR. EDWARDS: Along those same lines, as this 
20 
is being videotaped, I imagine in agreement amongst 
21 
the parties this will remain confidential except in 
22 
the case that there is a court order that the 
23 
videotape and her image is made public in any way. 
24 
So, if it's going to be made public in any way, 
25 
then, !just ask that it only happen by way of some 
Page 7 
1 
anonymity here. And I am not going to agree to 
2 
that, so —
3 
MR. CRITTON: Well, l can tell you I wouldn't 
4 
put a video on. I would not put a video that would 
5 
identify this individual, you're client's face. 
6 
All right. I would do nothing to identify her 
7 
face. So, her anonymity would be, quote, unquote, 
8 
preserved if that's your issue. 
9 
MIL EDWARDS: My issue is only preserving her 
10 
anonymity. So, I mean, are we in agreement that 
13. 
this is not going to be a video published in a 
12 
public forum or any way outside of use in a 
13 
courtroom to be seen by the judge? 
14 
MR. CRITTON: To the extent her picture or her 
15 
name would be used, I agree with that. Other than 
16 
that, just go to the court. And as i said, you can 
17 
file a motion with the court. if your position is 
18 
is that the deposition, again assuming there is 
19 
complete anonymity and her face is blotted out, 
20 
that the video cannot be filed with the court or 
21 
used in some other fashion, right, I agree. We're 
22 
not going to do anything that in any way impacts 
23 
the anonymity absent an order from Judge Hafele in 
24 
this particular case. 
25 
MR. EDWARDS: All right. We're in agreement 
Page 6 
1 
court order, either by way of Marra or Judge 
2 
Hafele. 
3 
MR. CRITTON: This is only being done in the 
4 
■case. And I will tell you what you can do 
5 
is 
we won't agree to that because Mr. )(Irvin 
6 
apparently gave Mr. Epstein's video to Jose 
7 
Lambiet, which was then immediately put on the 
8 
Post, and then ended up on, all over the country. 
9 
And be certainly had no issue associated with 
10 
confidentiality. So, whatever rules apply. 
11 
What I will tell you is with regard to the 
12 
video today, we'll give you whatever time you think 
13 
is necessary -- well, let's do it this way: Within 
14 
ten days fiom today you file a motion for 
15 
protective order in front of Hafele with regard to 
16 
this deposition, and we'll agree that it will 
17 
not — we won't touch it. 
18 
Mil. EDWARDS: I don't see how that's necessary 
19 
since we already have the Judge's agreed, we have 
20 
an agreed order that we can proceed anonymously. 
21 
Judge Hafele, as you know, has been very careful in 
22 
instructing yourself and everybody else in this 
23 
case that these individuals are to remain 
24 
anonymous. And obviously publishing this video in 
25 
any public forum will decrease or eliminate any 
Page 8 
1 
then. Okay. 
2 
MR- CRITTON: But, but I want to be clear, it 
3 
is to the extent that if the, you still need to 
4 
file a motion with the court to the extent that you 
5 
don't, that it's your position that even if her 
6 
face was blotted out and even if no names are used, 
7 
and you think that the video is to remain 
confidential, then you should file something with 
9 
the court. And I'll give you, like I said I will 
10 
give you ten days so you can proceed to file that 
11 
motion. 
12 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. So it's your intention to 
13 
use Ibis video, blot her face out and then post it 
14 
somewhere? 
15 
MR. CRITTON: I have no intentions at all. 
16 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 
17 
MR. CRITTON: And if you had brought this up 
18 
in a motion earlier, I would have addressed it at 
19 
the same time. 
20 
MR. EDWARDS: I think we're all on the same 
21 
page that the victims in this case are to remain 
22 
anonymous. i mean, everybody has been warned 
23 
repeatedly about using names outside of the 
24 
pseudonyms and exposing faces, things like that, to 
25 
the public outside of the court.
