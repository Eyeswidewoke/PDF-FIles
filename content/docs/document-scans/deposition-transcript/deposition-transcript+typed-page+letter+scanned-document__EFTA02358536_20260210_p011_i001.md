clichl>=A9 among stock market investors is that you should "buy on the rumor, sell on the fact" — the idea that 
investment is more ab=ut what you expect to happen in the future than the current state of play — obviously =his is the 
case with Tesla. 
While Tesla's investors believe that it is th= standard-bearer of a battery-powered future — and Ford is the archetypal 
mass-produ=tion legacy car business. That is the myth that CEO Elon Musk carefully crafted for thirty-something year 
old Wall Street analysists who can afford to buy a $100,000 car. But as someone who j=st leased a Chevy Bolt, I did so 
because it was half the price of an entry level Tesla, even though=it is fully loaded and gets the same mileage. And I 
leased because in three years every major automaker from Mercedes to Renault will be offering electric vehicles that 
get more than 250 miles =ith a single charge, so who knows what is going to be my next car. =nd in spite the setback of 
a fatal crash last year, when a Tesla on autopilot failed to tell the difference between =he side of a white lorry and a 
bright sky, the company continues to make strid=s towards a fully driverless car but so is Uber, Google and the other big 
aut=makers. 
I understand that Tesla also has a potentially lucrat=ve sideline in storage batteries for the home. The Powerwall is 
intended=to allow homes to store solar power, and Tesla is also due to start installing its first sola= roof tiles this year. I 
appreciate that Tesla's has set a goal of building 500,000 cars in 2018 and Musk ha= even raised the prospect of 
doubling that to lm by 2020— except that th=se production targets are unprecedented in the automotive industry and 
as Sams=ng last year's debacle with its Galaxy Note 7 cellphone catching fire =E2.4) pushing production delivery prior 
an exhausted testing has shown that a single defe=tive part from a supplier can kill sales and stock prices faster than 
E.coli at Chipotle. And just like McDonald's, Burger King, KFC which also had E.coli outbreaks but fared better than thei= 
smaller fast-food rival, should both Ford and Tesla suffer a similar misfor=une, I would bet on Ford coming through 
quicker. 
Yes, Tesla's new Model 3 is slated to start p=oduction this year and is intended to offer a more affordable version of 
previous models,=with a price tag around $35,000. If successful, the Model 3 could supercharge Tesla's growth by 
musclin= in on the territory of mass market rivals. But Tesla's model X crossover, while although sexy is currently not 
burning down the ho=se with sales. It's important to remember that despite the massive hype surrounding Tesla, the 
gigafactory currently nearing construction in Nevada will only allow the company to make 500,000 =nits a year by 2020. 
That would be fine if Tesla only wanted to sell cars to rich people, but CEO Elon Musk has been c=ear that the company's 
mission is to bring sustainable electric transport t= the mass market. To do that, an automaker needs scale. And to get 
scale, =esla will need to sell millions of vehicles a year and to increase production from its current lev=l to 1 million cars 
is truly wishful thinking. 
Therefore to sell more vehicles and more batteries fo= its storage business called Tesla Energy, Tesla needs more 
gigafactories. =Gigafactories currently go for about $5 billion. Elon got supplier partners to pay for about 60% of this 
one, but w= can't assume that will always be true. Tesla has incredible growth potential with vehicles and energy 
storage, but peopl= forget that this growth isn't free. On the positive side, if Tesla can continue to reduce its battery 
costs, it ha= the potential for a cost advantage that could never be overcome by internal-combustion manufacturers. 
Except again, like with vehicles, there are many other people here and abroad trying to come up with the next
