account number and check serial number to your financial instiution, unless the check is not processable electronically or a 
less costly process is available. By submitting a check for payment, you authorize us to initiate an electronic debit from your

account as soon as the same day we receive your check, and you will not receve that cancelled check with your bank or

day. Allocation of Payments and Credits: Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits 
among Features and Chaves on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sole discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature (mdudng current transactions). Different daily 
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the begin dna 
balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous biking periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, cr fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or creas, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the billing 
period, we also add an amount of Interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daly balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance format Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
bilkng period and dvide the total by the number of days in the billing period. Thisg
 
additionale AD for the Feature. If you pay 
the hlew Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avoid
 FC on features includerl in this 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADB far each Feature by the number of days in the baling period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total FC for the 
bilingperiod is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account. This method of calculating the ADB 
and FC results in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies: If you :now a Charge in a 
foreign currency, it wallas converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particularrate is 
required by applicabe law, we wtl choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency Is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, cr(b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by us from customary banking sources, on the 
conversion dare or the pnor business day, in each instance increased by 2%. This conversion rato may differ from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airfines) will be billed at the rates such 
estabfishments use. Billing Rights Summary: In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill: If you think your bill is 
incorrect, or 1 you need more information about atransaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the 
Customer Service address noted to the right. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on
