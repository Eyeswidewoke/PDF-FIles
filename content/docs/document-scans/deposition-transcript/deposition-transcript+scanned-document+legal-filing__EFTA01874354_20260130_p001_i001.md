Subject: Bell 430 claim 
Jeffrey. 
I need your guidance! I can't tell you how upset I am with Bell Helicopter warranty department. 
I received response from Bell warranty during our departure from Waco Tx regarding the EFIS tube that has the 
loose face plate. This unit is vacuum sealed and needs to be repair by HoneyWell. The EFIS tube is warranted 
by Bell 100% mainly since Bell 430 owners have complained it was a costly item and high failure rate. New unit 
is $140,000 and overhaul exchange is $71,000 This warranty program has been in effect for a couple of years 
due to its high failure rate. 
Just to recap what took place: While I was installing the new data plate with our new N number, I decided to 
install this above the EFIS tube, since this was the location of the old N number. My hand "touched" the face 
plate and I noticed it was loose,. I tried to remove the EFIS tube, but was afraid of damaging the unit further, so I 
called Edwards "David Burch" manager to assist, he sent his chief mechanic and removed the unit safely. Mr. 
Burch thought warranty would be in effect but noted, he never seen a face plate became dislodged from the 
box. At this time, Bell is accusing me of tampering with the unit and will not honor warranty. I personally spoke 
to Bell warranty the day the EFIS tube was removed, person named Guy, and he indicated that if Bell didn't 
approve of the free exchange, he would support me and bring this to the attention of his supervisor, Mr Dennis 
Wood. Our request was denied,. I explained to David Burch at Edwards that I've been a loyal Bell customer for 
over 11 years and given Bell tremendous amounts of money for repairs of our 407 and 430 helicopters. I feel 
that we should fight this matter to the fullest extent. 
The overhaul exchange of this EFIS tube is $71,000 The current deal Bell is offering me after I blew up on the 
phone with them today, they will give us a new EFIS tube with full warranty and we pay for the repair of our face 
plate at an estimated cost of $20,000 to $30,000 max cost according to Edwards. I told Bell this was 
unacceptable terms and would not agree to this deal. 
Jeffrey, I did nothing wrong, The face plate was loose, I tried to explain Bell, "for what reason or benifit would I 
have to tamper with this EFIS tube? it worked just fine,. I feel very strongly that we should fight this warranty 
claim to the max,. If it was in my power, I would never go to Bel for any repair in the future, but would not be 
a wise decision. I just don't want to give up the potential offer that is on the table without your input on how to 
proceed. This is the email I received from Bell warranty support below: 
Dave. 
I have spoken to Stuart in regards to the damaged (face plate loose) from the pictures that were provide. It 
appears that the damaged was caused by the customer trying to remove the unit, therefore there will be no 
warranty credit available against this issue. The new owner does have the option of customer repair through Bell 
if he so chooses and once repaired by Bell the display will fall into Bells warranty policy. 
Jeffrey below is the email I would like to send to Mr. Dennis Wood Manager warranty support at Bell, can you 
critique? 
Dear Mr. Dennis Wood 
like to explain fully what transpired during the findings of the loose face plate on our newly acquired Bell 430 
serial 49078 helicopter. While installing a data plate with our new N number which previously was installed 
above the EF1S tube on both captains and co-pilots side. My hand touched the face plate on the co-pilots EFTS 
tube and noticed it was loose. 1 have been a licence A & P mechanic since 1981. well qualified to remove and 
replace an indicator such as an EFTS tube. I tried to remove the Tube but was hesitant to damage since the 
face plate was very loose. I called Edwards in FXE to assist their chief mechanic Andy removed the indicator 
so we may send for repair. I have requested wan-anty exchange of this unit. Hyperion Air/ Freedom Air 
International has been a loyal Bell customer and operator for over 11 years. I feel that loyalty and customer 
support go a long way in this industry and would appreciate if you would reevaluate my claim in a favorable 
way. In the past 6 months our company has spent in excess of $300,000 in improvements to our Bell 
430 product, not to mention our expenditures while owning the Bell 407 since 2002. 
I look forward to your response.
