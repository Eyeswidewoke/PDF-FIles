Then there was Goldw=ter, "Mr. Conservative." Always first an= foremost a libertarian, he lashed out in the 1980s at 
the religious right=movement led by Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. In the 1990s, orthorox conservatives denounced 
him as a liberal for supporting environmental protections and gay rights. Indeed, it's fair to say that the =hree great 
projects of the post-1955 right — repealing the New Dea=, ultra-hawkishness (first anti-Soviet, then pro-Iraq invasion) 
and repeal=ng the sexual/culture revolution—have completely failed. Not only =hat, they are losing support among GOP 
voters. 
This =s nothing less than a failure of conservatism itself. After Buckley,=Reagan and Goldwater had jettisoned much of 
their earlier hard-edged conservatism, there should have be an intellectual reformation on the American r=ght in the 
1990s. And there were a number of candidates for a redesi=ned conservative ideology. Reagan brain truster James 
Pinkerton wrot= of a "new paradigm" that would accept the need for=government but make it more flexible. David 
Brooks and Bill Kristol =ailed for "national greatness conservatism" in the =radition of Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. A 
more populist alternative=was offered by Pat Buchanan, a mix of nativism, protectionism and 4>=9Cculture war." But 
instead of fading from the scene and opening t=e way to new thinking, old-fashioned Buckley-Goldwater-Reagan 
movement con=ervatism came back, in an even more radical form in the 2000s, catching me=(by then an ex-
neoconservative) and others by surprise. 
When George W. Bush was elected, like many others I expected him to com=ine the "kinder and gentler" domestic 
policy of his father=with the realist foreign policy symbolized by his father, Jim Baker and Br=nt Scowcroft. Instead W. 
doubled down on all the elements of the old Q=804oconservative movement" policy and left utter wreckage in his rake. 
Reagan had wrecked the budget with his tax cuts for the rich, b=t later in his two terms he presided over numerous tax 
increases. George W= Bush pushed through budget-wrecking tax cuts for the rich again, invoking=the same supply-side 
theory that had been discredited in the 1980s. =eagan left Social Security alone. George W. Bush made the partial 
privatiz=tion of Social Security—long the holy grail of the libertarian rig=t—a priority of his second term. That bombed 
with the public. 
Reagan chose his battles carefully—withdrawing fr=m Lebanon and invading tiny Grenada. Following 9/11, George W. 
Bush not on=y invaded Afghanistan but also invaded and occupied Iraq, which had nothin= to do with the Al Qaeda 
attacks and posed no serious threat to the U.S. o= its allies. The country is still paying for that mistake more than a 
deca=e later, and its reverberations have robbed neoconservatives of most of th=ir credibility. 
c=p> 
Reagan was careful to distance himse=f from the religious right while paying it lip service. George W. Bush andrKarl 
Rove chose to capitalize on hostility to gay rights and gay marriage =or partisan purposes. As president, therefore, W. 
showed far greater=fidelity to the objectives and values of movement conservatism than Reagan=himself had done. The 
result? A voter backlash inspired by the=bloody debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan that helped Democrats win back 
Con=ress in 2006 and the White House in 2008. Meanwhile, Bush's Social=Security privatization plan was so unpopular 
among Republican voters that = GOP-controlled Congress did not even bring it to a vote. What cause= this peculiar 
Indian summer of radicalized movement conservatism in the B=sh years? I think that the replacement of a unified 
conservative movement =y three parallel movements played a major role.
