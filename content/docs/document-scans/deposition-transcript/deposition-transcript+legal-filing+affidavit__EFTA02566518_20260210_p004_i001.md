language, while revisiting =hose areas that turn out to fall short. 
I would stop before language, but this may reflect a deep prejudice on =y part. I think that much of logic comes out of 
perceptual experience =ith contingencies in the world

Better yet: Have somebody actually give it to you. The actual WAIS =annot be taken on a computer or the like; it needs a

>» I agree. But I am not convinced that proper emotions are absolutely =ecessary for Intelligence (motivation might 
suffice to drive some kind =f non-emotional, serene Buddha intelligence). I am nevertheless =nterested in understanding 
and modeling them.

my computer is likely to malfunction. But from =his I cannot infer that computers cannot work without swapping. 
I believe that Richard Gregory had a version of that argument well =efore Sloman

Lesion data were the beginning, but there have been many sorts of =tudies now of the role of emotion in reasoning. The 
"social =euroscience" folks have done a lot of this stuff. I'm convinced.

I think so... I recall Kevin Ochsner years ago telling me how lousy the =ard test was, and that there were much better
