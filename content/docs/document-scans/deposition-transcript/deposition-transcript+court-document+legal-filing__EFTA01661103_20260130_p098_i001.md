We are replacing the entire Billing Statements section of the Agreement with the following new section entitled Billing Statements/Amount 
Due: 
Tilling Statements/Amount Due 
You must notify us immediately of any change in the mailing or e-mail address to which we send billing statements or notices that a 
billing statement has been posted ("Billing Address'). If you wish a Bluing Address change to apply to more than one account you 
maintain with us, you must tell us. You agree that vie may also update your Billing Address if we receive Information that your Billing 
Address has changed or is incorrect. We apply those terms of this Agreement that vary by state according to your Billing Address. 
When we receive information that you have changed your Billing Address, those terms of this Agreement that vary depending on the 
state of your Billing Address will apply to the entire balance of your Account, including existing balances. 
Each billing statement will reflect a New Balance and, if your balance includes Charges incurred on any Feature, a Minimum Amount 
Due. The "Amount Due" is the total of (I) all Charges on your Account other than those associated with Features, plus (ii) the Minimum 
Amount Due (described below) for any Charges associated with Features, plus (III) any portion of any previously billed Amount Due that 
remains unpaid. The Amount Due is due and payable once you receive the billing statement. You may pay more than the Amount Due, 
up to the total balance on your Account, at any time. 
The Amount Due for any Charges associated with Features will be the greatest of: 
• 1150m of the New Balance of all Features on the Closing Date of the billing statement (the calculation of which is rounded to the 
nearest whole dollar), 
• the current billed Finance Charges, or 
• $20 (or the total outstanding balance of all Features if it is less than $20). 
If the greatest of the three calculations immediately above is the current billed Finance Charges, then we will add $15 to the calculation 
of the Minimum Amount Due for Charges associated with the Features." 
We are replacing the last paragraph of the Payments section of your Agreement with the following: 
'Subject to appkable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits among Features and Charges on your Account In any order 
and manner determined by us In our sole discretion. In most cases, we will apply and allocate payments to the Minimum Amount Due 
on Feature balances first, then to amounts due in full. The remainder of your payment will be applied to any outstanding Feature 
balances. Amounts applied to Feature balances will be applied first to Feature balances at lower Annual Percentage Rates ("APRs") 
and then to higher APR Feature balances. In most cases, we will apply purchase credits first to the balance from which the 
corresponding debit originated. However, for servicing, administrative, systems or other business reasons, we may apply and allocate 
payments and credits among Features and to Charges on your Account in some other order or manner that we may determine In our 
sole discretion. You agree that we have the unconditional right to exercise this discretion in a way that is most favorable or convenient 
to us." 
We are adding a new section entitled Finance Charges on Features to the Agreement, reading in its entirety as follows: 
"Finance Charges on Features 
A. Finance Charges begin to accrue for each Charge as of the date it is added to the daily balance for a Feature, as described below. 
However, for Charges (other than Finance Charges) that are added to a balance automatically, no Finance Charges will accrue in any 
billing period in which the total Account balance on the Closing Date for the previous billing period is zero or a credit balance. 
B. Each Feature is subject to the same Daily Periodic Rate ("DPR"), unless we notify you otherwise. Except as provided below, the 
DPR for each Feature is based on an APR, which may vary. The APR is the Prime Rate (described below) plus 9.99%. A DPR is 
1/365th of the APR. Your DPRs and APRs appear on the accompanying supplement(s). When an APR changes, we apply it to any 
existing balance subject to that rate. 
C. The "Prime Rate' is determined once with respect to each billing period. The Prime Rate for each billing period is the Prime Rate 
published in the Money Rates section (or successor section) of The Wall Street Journal on (a) the first day of that billing period or (b) the 
day that is two days prior to the Closing Date of that billing period, whichever is higher. In each case, if such day is not a customary 
publication day for The Wall Street Journal, we will substitute the closest preceding day that is a customary publication day. If The Wall 
Street Journal ceases or suspends publication, we may refer to the Prime Rate published in any other newspaper of general circulation 
in New York, New York. or we may substitute a similar reference rate at our sole discretion. Any Increase or decrease to an APR 
resulting from a change in the Prime Rate takes effect as of the first day of the billing period. An increase in the Prime Rate means that 
the variable APRs (and corresponding DPRs) applicable to your Account will increase and you maywill incur higher Finance Charges 
and may have a higher Minimum Amount Due. 
D. The DPR (and corresponding APR) on all Features may increase to the Default Rate if during the Review Period (i) your Account is 
delinquent on the Closing Date of any three billing periods; (ii) your Account is delinquent on the Closing Date of any two consecutive 
billing periods: or (iii) on two or more occasions a payment submitted on your Account is not honored on first presentment. Your 
Account will be considered delinquent if payment of the Amount Due from a billing period is not credited to your Account by the Closing 
Date of the next billing period. The "Review Period" Is the period, constituting approximately one year, of twelve consecutive billing 
periods ending with the Closing Date of the current billing period, whether or not you received a statement for each such billing period. If 
the Default Rate Is applied, it will apply to your Account for twelve consecutive billing periods, beginning with the current billing period. 
The Default Rate will not apply to any balance for Features unless it is higher than the rate that would otherwise apply to that balance. 
The Default Rate is a DPR which corresponds to an APR equal to the Prime Rate plus 21.99%.*
