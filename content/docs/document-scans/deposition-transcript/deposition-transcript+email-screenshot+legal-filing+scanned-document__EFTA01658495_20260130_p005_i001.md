the investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign was based on insufficient evidence, saying he 
had 'no idea what on earth' the attorney general was talking about." 
USA Today (9/30, 10.31M) reports Comey "defended" the Russia investigation as 
"essential." He said, "Overall, I'm proud of the work," but he "conceded that there were 
'significant and important failings' in the bureau's repeated pursuit of surveillance authority to 
track former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, as part of the investigation." The 
Washington limes (9/30, Mordock, 492K) says Comey "took responsibility for what he 
described as 'embarrassing' errors the bureau made in the course of its investigation" into 
Page. Comey told the panel, "It's embarrassing. It's sloppy. I'm running out of words. ... There 
is no indication - and the inspector general would say it if he found it - that people were doing 
bad things on purpose, but that doesn't make it any less concerning or embarrassing." A report 
From DOJ IG "concluded the FBI's application to surveil Mr. Page was riddled with errors, 
mistakes and omissions." Comey "insisted he was unaware of the bungling, drawing scoffs from 
Republicans." 
Bloomberg (9/30, Strohm, 4.73M) reports, "Comey said the probe into whether people 
close to Donald Trump conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election was largely 
conducted 'by the book' but that specific aspects of the inquiry fell short." Bloomberg adds, 
"Pressed on Wednesday by Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, who said the probe was 
based on faulty assumptions and evidence tampering, Comey said he found the shortcomings -
which included doctoring an email from the CIA - 'deeply disturbing.' But he backed an 
inspector general's report that concluded the probe was valid and not driven by bias in the 
bureau's leadership." 
CNN (9/30, Herb, 83.16M) reports, "Comey pushed back against" Attorney General Barr's 
"attacks on the FBI's Russia investigation, arguing on Wednesday that the Justice Department's 
efforts to dismiss charges against Trump's first national security adviser Michael Flynn were 
'deeply concerning. "I have no idea what on Earth he is talking about; Comey said when asked 
to respond Barr's comments that the FBI's Russia investigation was 'abhorrent.'" Comey is 
quoted saying, "The notion that the attorney general believes that was an illegitimate endeavor 
to investigate that mystifies me." 
Reuters (9/30, Landay, Hosenball) reports, "Graham and other Republicans sought to pin 
some responsibility on Comey for the errors found in FBI applications for secret court warrants 
to monitor the communications of Carter Page, who briefly served as a 2016 Trump campaign 
advisor. 'To me this is a stunning failure of the system to work,' said Graham, a staunch Trump 
supporter." Reuters adds, "Several Republicans cited the case of a former FBI lawyer, Kevin 
Clinesmith, who pleaded guilty in August to doctoring a CIA email submitted with an application 
so that it said that Page was not an agency source, when in fact, he was. 'I know nothing about 
Mr. Clinesmith other than what I've read; Comey said." 
The Washington Times (9/30, Mordock, 492K) reports that Comey "admitted...that he 
wouldn't have signed the warrant application to wiretap former Trump campaign aide Carter 
Page. 'No. Not without a much fuller discussion about how they were thinking about their 
obligations to the court,' Mr. Comey said in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee." 
The Times adds, "Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz last year concluded 
the FBI made multiple errors when it asked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to 
approve a secret order to monitor Mr. Page in 2016 and 2017. The mistakes included multiple 
inaccuracies and omission of exculpatory evidence. That application was renewed a total of 
three times and Mr. Comey said Wednesday he signed off on the renewals." 
The Hill (9/30, 2.98M) reports, "When asked by Graham whether it was "fair to say" the 
FBI investigation was 'not done by the book; Comey replied: 'No, I don't think that is fair to 
say.' His response did little to sway Republicans, who spent the hours-long hearing quizzing him 
on the investigation and venting about the handling of warrant applications. 'God help us all if 
this was done by the book; Graham said. 'It was such an egregious violation of fairness,
