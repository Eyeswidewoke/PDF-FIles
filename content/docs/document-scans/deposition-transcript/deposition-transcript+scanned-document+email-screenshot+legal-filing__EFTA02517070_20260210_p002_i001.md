order to fulfill my obligations under our&nbsp; agreement.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; discovered fact that 
you&nbsp; in reality need an entire&nbsp; family office built from scratch has been trying &nbsp; I have&nbsp; 
aleady&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; 
de- facto to try to&nbsp; help.&nbsp; I would&nbsp;&nbsp; suggest that Phai=ons payroll and attention pales in 
importance&nbsp; to your personal structure,which has taken a back seat, Some of &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; my 
suggestions&nbsp; regarding the Eysium&nbsp; office&nbsp; are as follows&nbsp;&nbsp; you will need a budget of 3- 5 
million per year.&nbsp; CEO&nbsp; 1 million,&nbsp; new tax person to work with rich, 250.&nbsp; new 
bookkeeper&nbsp; ,200&nbsp;&nbsp; new paralegal to work with ADA Alan etc , coordinating with Apollo, Akin , paul 
weiss , new acct openings , &nbsp; sec filings, sales tax review,&nbsp; etc. 
&nbsp; $150 . art 
point person. loan , inventory, purchasing support, &nbsp; $??&nbsp; softw=re servers. video conferencing,&nbsp; tax 
oversight. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe&nbsp; You should&nbsp; rapidly address trustees&nbsp; , 
gift trust,&nbsp; succesion,&nbsp; wills of debra and children,&nbsp; ,&nbsp; monetization&nbsp; events, cash flow. 
etc &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can of course&nbsp; share my experiences with you on each issue. 
<br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
With regard&nbsp; the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am torn, as my very 
strong inclination is not to be involved at all .&nbsp; It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall 
many that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote you months ago that the quality of 
the people involved need to&nbsp; =e upgraded. ( lucky for me&nbsp; these last issues arose way before the begi=ing 
of my involvement ) &nbsp; I am also aware however&nbsp; of&nbsp; my overarching friendship&nbsp; obligations 
of&nbsp; ok, -given all the complexities&nbsp; who else can do it? problem. <br>&nbsp;Your family office needs a 
daddy.&nbsp; child=en with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking with little direction.&nbsp; As a 
stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge&nbsp; Everyone would report to him.&nbsp; 
eilee= included. He would however work for me.&nbsp; this is not, by a long shot&nbsp; my first choice as I prefer 
only&nbsp; being responsible and standing behind =y own personal&nbsp; work (&nbsp; ie the word DONE will no 
longer be transmitted to reflect status stated&nbsp; by others )&nbsp; <br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With no 
commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have&nbsp; failed&nbsp; in my attempt in&nbsp; trying to 
think&nbsp; through the problem&nbsp; creatively . My&nbsp; organizations handling of the more complex isssues I 
believe you might find&nbsp; very costly, very ! ( however many structures available&nbsp; some risk sharing, maybe 
risk caps ,etc ► but would require my teams doing the work&nbsp; , not yours.&nbsp; <span style="background-color: 
rgb(255, 255, 0);">Ada&nbsp; should be only a trust, grat administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp; not sure what role you prefer for 
Eileen as you hired her initially&nbsp; to oversee investments.&nbsp; whether Rich your controller stays or not,&nbsp; 
is not urgent.&nbsp; having Tom report to a =ew 
person,- is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> coordination with Suydam Kathy gregory, I would suggest limiting to one 
person.&nbsp; The increasing public profile needs to be tak=n into consideration. <br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp; talk 
later..<br
