Wood v. State, 750 So.2d 592 (1999) 
24 Fla. L. Weekly S240 
withheld adjudication and placed him on probation. which he 
completed in March 1992. A federal trial court subsequently 
adjudicated him guilty of drug charges and imposed an 
enhanced sentence of concurrent 240-and 120-month terms 
because his 1988 plea counted as a prior offense under federal 
law. 
In 1998 and while in federal prison, Wood filed a pro se 
petition for a writ of error 
ElNI in Florida circuit 
court, seeking to have his 1988 plea set aside. *593 He 
asserted that his lawyer did not tell him at the 
he entered 
the plea that it could be used against him in federal court as 
a "prior offense." Wood sought a writ of error 
MEI 
rather than relief under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 
3.850 because he had completed his sentence for the 1988 
convictions and no longer considered himself "in custody" as 
required under the rule. I The circuit court found that Wood 
met the "in custody" requirement, considered the petition a 
motion under ride 3.850, and denied it as —barred. The 
district court affirmed and certified conflict with Malcolm, 
wherein the court held that lujnlike the general two-year 
11M 
for filing a motion to vacate under rule 3.850 
... there is no express 
for filing a petition 
for writ of error 
M." 
605 So.2d at 949. Wood 
sought review before this Court and we appointed counsel to 
represent him on the issue of whether writs of error 
are subject to the 
contained in rule 
3.850. 
This Court in I/altman 1'. Stare. 371 So.2d 48' I I '0791, 
described the contours of the writ of error iteram non', 
an ancient writ designed to correct judgments and sentences 
based on errors of fact: 
The requirements of a writ of error gam WAS have been 
set out in numerous cases from this Court. A petition for 
this writ addressed to the appellate court must disclose fully 
the alleged facts relied on; mere conclusory statements 
are insufficient. The appellate court must be afforded a 
full opportunity to evaluate the alleged facts for itself and 
to determine whether they establish prima facie grounds. 
Furthermore, the petition should assert the evidence upon 
which the alleged facts can be proved and the source of 
such evidence. The function of a writ of error sign as 
is to correct errors of fact, not errors of law. The facts upon 
which the petition is based must have been unknown by the 
trial court, by the party, or by counsel at the IM of trial, 
and it must appear that defendant or his counsel could not 
have known them by the use of diligence. 
In considering a petition for writ of error 
the appellate court has the responsibility to determine the 
legal effect of the facts alleged upon the previously entered 
judgment. When the appellate court finds that the facts arc 
sufficient in legal effect, the next step is for the trial court 
to determine the truth of the allegations in an appropriate 
evidentiary hearing. 
The general rule repeatedly employed by this Court to 
establish the sufficiency of an application for writ of error 
Ism Mal is that the alleged facts must be of *594 such 
a vital nature that had they been known to the trial court, 
they conclusively would have prevented the entry of the 
judgment 
This traditional "conclusiveness test" in error 
Ms ins proceedings is predicated on the need for 
finality in judicial proceedings. This is a sound principle, 
for litigants and courts alike must be able to determine with 
certainty a IM when a dispute has come to an cnd. 
Id. at 484-85 (citations and emphasis omitted).
We subsequently held that rule 3.850 was patterned after the 
writ of error 
En and largely supplanted the writ for 
criminal defendants in custody: 
The rule was copied almost verbatim from its federal 
counterpart, section 2255 of Tide 28 of the United States 
Code, in effect since 1948. As this court noted in State v. 
Alatera[. 266 So.2d 661 (Fla. 1972)], "Mhe Reviser's Note 
following i,4 2755 states: `This section restates, clarifies and 
amplifies the procedure in the nature of the ancient writ 
of error IMMO Rota.' " It therefore appears that from the 
beginning this rule was intended to serve the function of a 
writ of error 
1M. 
There is no principled reason why some claims based on 
newly discovered evidence must be brought under ride 
3.850 and others must be brought under 
We believe the only currently viable use for the writ of 
error 
MN is where the defendant is no longer 
in custody. thereby precluding the use of rule 3.850 as a 
remedy. 
For these reasons, we hold that all newly discovered 
evidence claims must be brought in a motion pursuant to 
Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850, and will not be 
cognizable in an application fora writ of error 
unless the defendant is not in custody.
