Illinois Developer Pleads Guilty To Wire Fraud. 
The Chicago Sun-Times (11/13, Seidel, 875K) reports, "A developer who made secret 
recordings for the feds of former Ald. Danny Solis and House Speaker Michael Madigan pleaded 
guilty to wire fraud Friday." According to the Sun-Times, "Federal prosecutors charged See Y. 
Wong back in March, days before the coronavirus pandemic took hold in Chicago and years 
after he played a key role in a public corruption investigation that has embroiled city and state 
politics in recent years. Wong made a secret 2014 audio and video recording for the feds of 
Solis and Madigan, according to court records and sources. That recording became part of the 
investigation that persuaded Solis to then secretly record the now-indicted Ald. Edward M. 
Burke. However, Wong only helped the feds because he hoped a judge would go easy on him 
one day for a fraud that was only identified when the feds filed a seven-page charging 
document known as an information against him in March." 
The Chicago Tribune (11/13, Meisner, 2.65M) reports, "Wong was charged in a seven-page 
criminal information in March for allegedly lying to banks and buyers involved with his Canal 
Crossing building, records show. He pleaded guilty Friday during a hearing held via video 
conference before U.S. District Judge Charles Norgle. The 20-page plea agreement does not 
specifically mention the Solis probe, but calls on Wong to provide "complete and truthful" 
information in any investigation and testify if necessary. Wong agreed to have his sentencing 
delayed until his cooperation is complete. Norgle set a status hearing in the case for Feb. 5." 
FBI Arrests Texas Man On Fraud Charges. 
El Paso (TX) Inc. (11/15, Crowder, 32K) reports, "Daniel Steadley, the former head of a once-
popular health insurance-type plan in El Paso, has been indicted on 19 counts of fraud and 
arrested by the FBI after a protracted investigation involving state and federal agencies." 
According to El Paso Inc., "Gregg Sofer, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, and 
FBI Special Agent in Charge Luis Quesada announced the legal actions against Steadley on Nov. 
5, the day of his arrest. The following day Federal Magistrate Robert Castafieda set his bond at 
$50,000, and Steadley went free after posting a 10% cash deposit. If convicted, he faces up to 
20 years in federal prison." El Paso Inc. adds, "According to the Oct. 28 indictment, Steadley 
operated two companies from 2014 to 2018 that sold Unique MEC Healthcare Plans for as little 
as $99 a month to about 2,000 El Pasoans, and 'stole approximately $1.5 million in premiums 
from unsuspecting victims during his scheme." 
FBI Searching For Man Accused Of Stealing Trade Secrets From Texas Firm. 
The Houston Chronicle (11/13, Dellinger, 730K) reports, "The FBI is searching for a Chinese 
man accused of stealing and selling trade secrets from a Houston oil and gas company." 
According to the Chronicle, "Between 2019 and 2020, Lei Gao, 44, also known as "Jason," and 
others allegedly schemed to obtain trade secrets from a Houston-based manufacturer of 
advanced coiled tubing, according to the FBI. The stolen trade secrets were used to assist in the 
development of an advanced coiled tubing product, which Gao and con-conspirators introduced 
to the market for sale in 2020, the FBI said in a statement. Gao left the United States and 
returned to China in 2019 and has not returned, according to authorities."

them of $8.75 million, according to the U.S. Department of Justice." Reuters adds, "U.S.
