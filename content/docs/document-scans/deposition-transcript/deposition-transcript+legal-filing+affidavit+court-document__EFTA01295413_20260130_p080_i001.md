2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40263, * 
A. Procedural History 
On August 10, 2010, Loadman Group, L.L.C. ("Loadman Group") and Eric J. Loadman 
("Loadman") filed a complaint based on diversity jurisdiction against defendant Banco 
Popular North America ("defendant" or "Banco"). (Doc. No. 1.) The complaint alleged 
various state law claims stemming from Banco's decision not to close on a r21 Small 
Business Administration ("SBA") insured loan to Loadman and Loadman Group. (Id. at 1.) 
Loadman and Loadman Group filed an amended complaint on May 3, 2011, alleging 
claims for breath of oral and written contracts (Count 1), breach of the duty of good faith 
and fair dealing (Count 2), willful misconduct and intentional misrepresentation (Count 3), 
intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count 4), and negligent misrepresentation 
(Count 5). (Doc. No. 19.) Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, interest, 
costs, and attorney's fees. 
1 Count 1 of the amended complaint is divided into three subparts (A. B. and C). Count 1(A) alleges breach of an oral contract 
promising no undue delay in closing. (Doc. No. 19 at 155.) Court 1(8) alleges breach of an oral promise with regard to 
satisfaction of certain environmental conditions. (Id. at 156.) Count 1(C) alleges breach of a written contract arising from a loan 
commitment letter. ye at 157.) 
On July 26, 2011, Loadman filed a Voluntary Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in the 
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia: On April 2, 2012, 
Banco moved for summary judgment, arguing, in part, that in r31 light of the bankruptcy 
filing, plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue their claims in this Court. In their opposition to 
summary judgment, plaintiffs conceded Loadman no longer had standing to pursue this 
action, but argued substitution of the bankruptcy trustee would remedy the defect. 
2 In his bankruptcy, Loadman listed his co-plaintiff in this action, Loadman Group, as a corporation in which he had ownership, 
but indicated it had no assets. On Schedule B. he listed this lawsuit as an asset or potential asset of his estate. 
On June 13, 2012, the bankruptcy court granted a motion by the bankruptcy trustee to 
employ plaintiffs' counsel in this action as special counsel to the trustee to pursue 
Loadman's claims pending before this Court. (Doc. No. 48-1 at 1561.) On July 3, 2012, this 
Court granted plaintiffs' unopposed motion to substitute Tamara Miles Ogier, Trustee 
("Trustee"), as a party plaintiff in place of plaintiff Loadman and deemed the previously 
filed opposition brief to summary judgment as filed by the Trustee and Loadman Group 
(collectively "plaintiffs").' The parties thereafter completed briefing on the summary 
judgment motion, which included two additional motions by defendant: r4] one (Doc. No. 
52) to strike the affidavit of Loadman that plaintiffs attached to their opposition, and 
another (Doc. No. 53) to strike the affidavit of Frank Coco ("Coco") that plaintiffs attached 
to their opposition and the supplemental affidavit from Coco that plaintiffs sought leave to 
file. In a Memorandum Opinion and Order filed contemporaneously with this Memorandum 
Opinion and Order (Doc. No. 64), the Court granted plaintiff leave to file Coco's 
supplemental affidavit, construed defendant's motions to strike as objections pursuant to 
Rule 56, and sustained defendant's objections in part. Defendant's motion for summary 
judgment is now ripe for disposition.
