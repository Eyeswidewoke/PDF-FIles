Well, I just can't have him teasing you and would feel so much better if I could 
talk to him and make sure he's on his best behaviour. 
So, If you really wish to 
wait until the last moment before you give it to me, that's OK. 
Oh, guess I 
could call your mom and get his number, since I did happen to save it as you used 
my phone if you recall. 
A nice boyfriend would call just to say hi to her, and 
ask if it wasn't too much of a bother could she give me Kevin's number. 
By the 
way, when are we going to see her?

I'll just take your promise to behave at face value and leave it at that. I 
shall avoid any mention of you for the time being. Kevin told me I do not have 
to give a name yet - I shall avoid your name for as long as security does not 
ask for it, and by that avoid exciting Kevin's interest. 
I never do deals with 
my brother - not even over something as innocuous as teasing me - it would 
merely make matters worse. Therefore you may not haye his no.
