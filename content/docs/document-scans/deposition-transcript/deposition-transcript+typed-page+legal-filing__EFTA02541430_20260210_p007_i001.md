We have heard you express that you don't have enough money, and thi= is leading you to make big decisions 
that we're afraid could have har=ful consequences for you. Moving is exhausting, and moving twice in three years even 
more so. We would hate to=see you to leave your condo unless you somehow aren't happy there. Mov=ng out of the 
Boston area would be more disruptive still -- again, we'= happily support that if it's what you both want for yourselves, 
but you shouldn't have to do it because of m=sconceptions about money. Teaching classes could be both rewarding and 
dra=ning for you; doing it just to chase down a little bit of extra salary mon=y does not make sense in your 
circumstances. And we definitely don't want to see you drop services that are importa=t to your research and your 
legacy, like your journal subscriptions or Ant=ony's invaluable work on your publications. 
Most of all, we are concerned that you are experiencing such high level= of stress that are simply misplaced. 
We don't understand why you need to worry about money. We know that=you have several million dollars in 
your IRA and that you receive hundreds=of thousands of dollars each year in IRA distributions, as well as significant 
income from royalties and oth=r sources. Of course, many of your expenses have risen, because of some wo=derful 
changes you've made in your life: adding Valeria to the family,=moving to Cambridge, and enjoying some sightseeing as 
part of your travels. We've been thrilled to see your l=fe develop like this. We were relieved that money did not pose an 
obstacle=to you living this phase of your life in the best way possible for you, as=well as providing some long-term 
support for Valeria. 
But something else has changed very dramatically in the way your money =s flowing. Your spending has shot up, 
way out of proportion to the expense= we're aware of. It looks to us as if the money is just disappearing. You have 
enough money to support =he lifestyle you and Valeria have been living, but not enough to keep spen=ing at the rate 
you have been. 
We understand that it is distressing and even frightening to worry abou= the money running out. We can see 
why you are grasping for solutions like=considering disruptive lifestyle changes and looking for other sources of money. 
We know these decisions ar= ultimately up to the two of you to take, but they are not the solutions w= want for you. We 
don't want you to suffer the strain and dislocation;=and also we don't believe these small changes to your cash flow will 
solve the bigger problem of your startlingl= high spending rate. Some may even cost more money than they save.<=pan 
style="colorblack"> 
We believe that you two -- while you are both brilliant at so many thin=s -- have never developed the practical 
skills of money management. Your t=oubles began when you stopped working cooperatively with the professionals who 
had always succeeded in h=lping you meet your goals in the past. We want you to find some financial =rofessional who 
can help you live your lives comfortably and free of finan=ial worry. They can help you outline your goals, both as two 
individuals and as a couple; show you what resourc=s you have; figure out if you have enough to meet your goals; figure 
out i= you have been spending money faster than you need to; and suggest the lea=t painful compromises you might 
make to save money, if that proves necessary after all. They can do this w=th utmost discretion. But you need to make it 
a priority to find the right=person, communicate promptly and openly with them, and take their advice s=riously. 
It pains us to see you trying to figure it all out on your own and comi=g up with horrifying and ineffective 
solutions. You should be enjoying you= life together and feeling confident about your futures. You've earned a lot of 
money through a I=fetime of hard work -- please get the help you need to use it effectively.=/span> 
You also need to make a clear decision about the role you want the rest=of your family to have in your financial 
affairs. The three of us would be=delighted to join you and your financial advisor in discussing the whole family's 
circumstances, incl=ding the history of your estate planning and the many gifts you've giv=n us. We used to discuss this 
regularly with Max and Bainco, and they woul= help us develop unified plans to meet the whole extended family's 
needs. Meetings like this don't requir= us to share all the details of our private financial affairs with each ot=er, the way 
one does with one's individual advisor -- but the more we =hare, the more opportunities we may find to help each other. 
It is up to you whether to continue this kind of open dis=ussion with us.
