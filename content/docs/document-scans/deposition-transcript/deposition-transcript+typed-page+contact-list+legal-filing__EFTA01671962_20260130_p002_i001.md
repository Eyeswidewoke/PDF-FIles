Method to calcul2e FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (OPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature (including current transactions) Different dairy 
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADS for each feWure. we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous tilling periods) (2) add any new transactions, debts, or fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or credts. and (4) mnake any appropriate adjustments For each day after the first day of the billing 
period, sfre also add an amount of in 
t equal to the previous days daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
re
Featu . This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance tor that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, t is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
billing penod and divide the total by the number of days in the being period. Thisg Ives us the ADB for the Feature. If you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will anted additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. II you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in the tilling period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rooming. The total FC for the 
tilling _loaned is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account This method o calculabnl the ADB 
and FO results in daily oonpounding of FC. Transactions Made In Foreign Currendes: It 
incur a Charge in a 
foreign currency, it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents Unless a particular rate is
