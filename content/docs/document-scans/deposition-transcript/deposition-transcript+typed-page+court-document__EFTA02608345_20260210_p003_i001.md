The critics are wrong on =he facts and the law. They also ignore a fact going to 
the heart of fundam=ntal fairness: In the decade since paying his debt to society, =effrey Epstein has led a life 
characterized by responsible citizenship, nu=erous acts of generosity and good deeds. 
Here are the true key facts: Jeffrey Eps=ein, a successful self-made businessman 
with no prior criminal history wha=soever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounted to solicitation of p=ostitution. That 
conduct was wrong and a violation of Flor=da state law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs or the =ike were 
involved, some of the women he paid were under the age of 18= Those facts were carefully assessed by experienced 
state sex c=ime prosecutors who aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one=turned a blind eye to potential 
offenses to the public order. To the=contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensiv= fifteen-
month investigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division.=C24, Mr. Epstein was then indicted by the state grand 
jury on a single fe=ony count of solicitation of prostitution.

=span style="font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:lrem">During that int=nse 
investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed=C24>the evidence, met face-to-face with many 
of the asserted victims, con=idered their credibility — or lack thereof — and considere= the extent of exculpatory 
evidence, including sworn testimony=C24kfrom many that they lied about being eighteen years old to be allowed=into 
Mr. Epstein's home. After months of negotiations, the s=ate prosecutors believed they had reached a reasoned 
resolution of the mat=er that vindicated the public interest — a resolution entirely con=istent with that of cases 
involving other similarly-situated defendants..C24, The system worked as it should have.

Then, in came the feds. The United Sta=es Attorney's Office extensively and 
aggressively investigated whether=Mr. Epstein had engaged in a commercial human trafficking ring, targeted m=nors, or 
used the internet or traveled interstate in the process.0=A0 But that's not what this was and that's not w=at happened. 
That is precisely why the federal authorities.=8O. ultimate decision to defer prosecution to the state was th= right 
one. 
=owever, the federally-demanded resolution was not without conditions. The 
=ederal prosecutors insisted on various unorthodox requirements that M=. Epstein's experienced defense team had 
never seen imposed on any=defendant anywhere. Under the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was requ=red to request that 
the state prosecutors demand the imposition of a thirt=-month sentence that included both jail time and the strict=st 
conditions of probation: lifetime sex-offender registration. Those drac=nian measures were far more than warranted by 
the state grand jury*=8040s indictment and would not have otherwise been required under th= previously agreed-
upon state disposition. As part of this highly unu=ual deal, the government required Jeffrey to pay for a highly 
ex=erienced group of attorneys to bring claims against him on behalf of = government list of asserted victims. Jeffrey 
was required to waive the ri=ht to challenge those claims without being provided the asserted victimQ=804>s identities 
by the government until after he was incarcerated. =Importantly, the feds' decision to decline prosecution in deference 
to=the state in exchange for these extraordinary requirements =as reviewed and approved at the multiple levels of the 
U.S. Department of =ustice. Jeffrey took full responsibility, complied with th= feds' demands, served his sentence, and 
in the process was treate= exactly the same (including his time served) as any other state=incarcerated individuals. His 
conduct while in custody was exemplary= and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. =/u>
