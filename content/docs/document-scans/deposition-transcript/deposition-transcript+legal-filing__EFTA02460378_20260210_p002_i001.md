Dear Andre: 
Last night I saw OSLO and wanted to share a note of =ongratulations. JT's play; Bart's staging and =he LCT 
production are brilliant and moving and urgent. <=p> 
I'm an atheist and grew up in a Jewish house=old. We rarely went to temple. Being Jewish had a cultural 
meaning =E2 not religious — and the core cultural values were rooted =n morality and justice. It was impossible to 
speak about Israel with my parents. Some of my family died in the Holocaust=C2 and I had two relatives who lived in 
Israel and were miraculous surv=vors of Auschwitz — they married when they got out. </=> 
Arabs were monsters who wanted to push the Jews into=the sea, i.e.to <http://i.e.to> destroy =C2 Jewish 
identity and exterminate us. 
Arafat wa= a synonymous with Hitler — inhuman. Arafat --- =ike Hitler -- cowardly and 
heinously killed innocent civilians =C2 The Israelis were blameless. They didn't take la=d. They didn't make 
Palestinians second class citizens= There was a UN treaty after Hitler. =C2 The larger Arab countries fanned the fires 
of Palestinian discontent =ecause Arabs hated Jews. They were jealous of us. Anyway, I was told, the larger Arab 
countries c=uld offer the Palestinians land for a homeland. 
It was impossible to make peace with the Palestinian= as the PLO were terrorists and didn't want peace. They 
wanted o=r extermination. When I visited Israel with my parents ,it was=pointed out where such and such a battle had 
been fought; where the streets had run red with blood; where innocent children had horr=bly died. They had been 
killed horribly, but it was not mentioned wh=t happened to Palestinian children. 
</=> 
The conflict with Jews and Arabs/ Arabs and Jews was=the defining moral conflict of my growing up. Before the 
Civil=Rights movement, before Vietnam, for me, the burning questions of justice =nd injustice were made clear in the 
Palestinian -Israeli conflict. Clearly, there was no clear right and=wrong. There is injustice on both sides. Peace would 
be a canv=s for trying to work out differences and allow co-existence while th= fury on both sides would hopefully 
slowly abate. 
What I found so moving about OSLO as theatre is that=it brought alive a simple, human belief in the possibility 
of people who h=te each other; who had done mutual injustice; confronting each other=and talking. OSLO makes this 
achingly human and dramatic. The complexity of debate and negotiation =E2 words — become wonderful theatre. 
The movemen= of events works and the OSLO doesn't end -- as we kno= -- with sweetness and accord but with 
possibility and ambigui=y. A handshake. And all this was happening while there was terrible conflict happening. =C2 
No matter what we think of OSLO, people who had never talked t=gether, but only killed each other, met and spoke. It's 
a gr=at disturbing subject for theatre and art and, of course, vital for us to be reminded when we demonize the other, or 
our enemies, th=t it isn't so simple. 
Best,
