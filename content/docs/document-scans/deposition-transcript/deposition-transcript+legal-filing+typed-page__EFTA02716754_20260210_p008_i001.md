$40 billion valuation from just that. Their inv=stors are betting on a behavioral change amount where a lot of people are 
willing=to spend more than they do now to get things on demand." 
All of this=sound cool except that there is little barriers to entry for competitors, here in America such as Lyft, Zipcar or 
Ge=Taxi and abroad such as Addison Lee in London and Hailo a British new technology platform that m=tches taxi 
drivers and passengers through its mobile phone application and is fully available in New York City and has announced 
the launches of services in Madrid, the rest of Ireland, Barcelona, Washington DC, Tokyo and Osaka by t=e end of the 
year, as well as stiffening competition from loca= taxi and limousine=C2Qcompanies. Remember Groupon, the deal a 
day website that featured discounted gift certificates for restaurants, spas and other services and goods. Groupon 
launched in November 2008, and the first market for Groupon was Chicago, followed soon thereafte= by Boston, New 
York City, and Toronto. By October 2010 Groupon served more than 150 markets in North America and 100 markets in 
Europe, Asia and South America and had 35 million registered use=s. 
<=pan style="font-size:12ptline-height:107%;font-family:Georgia,serif5Th= idea for Groupon was created by now-
ousted CEO and Pittsburgh native Andrew Mason. The idea subsequently gained the attention of his former employer, 
Eric Lefkofsky, w=o provided $1 million in "seed money" to develop the idea. In April 2010, the company was valued at 
$1.35 billion. According to a D=cember 2010 report conducted by Groupon's marketing association and reported in 
Forbes Magazine and =he Wall Street Journal, Groupon was "projecting that the company is on pace to make $1 billion 
in sales faster than any oth=r business, ever". However, a report from Forrester Research in October 2011 suggested 
that the Groupon business model was a "disaster" and that the firm had become an example of how fast an Internet 
darling can fall. Since then Groupon has been acquiring as many companies as it can to stay alive as fewer and fewer 
peop=e are using its initial proposition. 
<=span> 
In fact some analysts claimed that Groupon =perates "like" a Ponzi scheme, according to interpretation of Initial public 
offering (IPO) documentation, because it has publicly disclosed that it is losing approximately US$100 million per 
quarter, has a net negative balance of $230 million, and is usi=g later investors' money to pay off earlier investors. 
But lets get back to Ube=. Because a $40 billion valuation is significantly more than that of Tesla ($28), Fiat ($16), Mazda 
($16) and Subaru ($12). It is just $14 billion les= than General Motors and two-thirds of the value of Ford ($64) which is 
havi=g its best year ever. And please explain how Uber is worth more than half of BMW ($73) and in the vicinity of half 
o= the value of Daimler/Mercedes Benz ($90). The Uber model is that it k=eps 20% of the gross revenues with its drivers 
getting the remainder. Its most optim=stic projection is that Gross Revenues in 2015 will be $10 billion, which after cost 
would leave the comp=ny netting a little north of $1.2 billion or 33 times gross. 
=p class="MsoNormal"> 
And there are already signs of that the big auto =ompanies are getting into the game as competitors to Uber. BMW, for 
example, has l=unched i Ventures, a venture-capital wing inspired by the idea that "the emerging field =f mobility 
services is in a continuous state of evolution." That branch of BMW has already put money into a location-aware city
