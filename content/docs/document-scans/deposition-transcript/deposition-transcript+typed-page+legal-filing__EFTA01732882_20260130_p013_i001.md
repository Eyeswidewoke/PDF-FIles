for theirs - and there will no doubt be some tact=cal victories as the Assad government reclaims some rebel-held 
territory.=C24> But Putin will not likely accomplish the physically impossible task =hat Obama and others have already 
attempted: bombing a broken country back=into shape. At what point will the Russian leader write a confidenti=l note 
to Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to confess that their strategy of="strategic bombing" has yielded "zilch"?=/span> 
Is ego and acceptance as the other world superpower =oing to be worth this most recent excursion into international 
warfare?Q=A0 Maybe for Putin, who likes to be photographed riding a horse shirtless =n winter is going to be worth the 
sacrifice. Because Putin's attempt a= "shock and awe" in Syria has all the hallmar=s of failed U.S. policies of the past. In 
the initial days, for inst=nce, the Russian media has focused on the pinpoint accuracy of the air str=kes in taking out 
"most" of the Islamic State's ammun=tion and heavy machinery. It will take some time before more critica= reports - of 
Russian bombing of medical facilities or missiles that went =stray in Iran - reach Putin's constituents. 
Then=there's the emphasis on the preemptive nature of the attacks. "," George W. Bush fa=ously said (more than once). 
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Me=vedev essentially said the same thing last week: "It's better =o do it abroad rather 
than fight terrorism inside the country."=C24> Of course, the Russians have more to worry about. Neither the =aliban 
nor Saddam Hussein had any plans to attack the United States (al=Qaeda was a different matter). The Islamic State, 
meanwhil=, has thrown a thousand Chechen fighters into battle, and who knows what m=ght happen if these battle-
hardened veterans ever make it back to Russia p=oper. 
A handful of Russian tourists and hostages hav= died at the hands of Islamic extremists in the Middle East. A few o= the 
Russian Marines now hunkered down in Syria will probably die as well,=particularly now that the Homs Liberation 
Movement (part of the Free Sy=ian Army) has promised to use suicide bombers to weed out the Russians= Just this 
week, as a shot across the bow, insurgents shelled the Ru=sian embassy in Damascus. But Russians will only feel the 
true conse=uences of Putin's actions when the next wave of retaliatory bombings s=rikes Russia itself. The Moscow 
subway was hit by two suicide bomber= in 2010 and the Moscow airport was targeted in 2011. Just this week= the 
Russian government has reportedly thwarted another attack on public t=ansportation, allegedly organized this time by 
the Islamic State. Here, th=n, is where Putin's chess-playing skills reveal themselves to be sub-p=r. He is throwing his 
pieces into battle without protecting his flan=s. The Russian public should brace itself for blowback. 
This is the ugliest parallel with Amer=can follies. After all, the air wars that the Bush administration co=ducted in the 
2000s continue to haunt the United States even after the dra=atic toppling of the kings. Indeed, only as the wars 
continued in Ir=q and Afghanistan long after Saddam and the Taliban no longer held power d=d the United States learn 
that a symmetrical game of chess was a poor meta=hor for the strategies needed to address asymmetrical warfare 
against a de=ermined adversary. Bombing a country to rubble only produces a flint= determination on the part of the 
survivors to fight back. As Fiffer=also pointed out — It's a lesson that Nixon learned (too la=e), that Obama is struggling 
to learn (or perhaps struggling to teach =is Republican opponents), and that Putin, in the arrogance of his power, 
p=obably thinks that he doesn't need to learn at all.
