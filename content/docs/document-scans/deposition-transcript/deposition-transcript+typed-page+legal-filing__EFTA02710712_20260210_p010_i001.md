strong likelihood that bridge would have collapsed. =hese all are tragedies waiting to happen. The I-95 bridges were 
built in the early 1960s and are now more than 50 years o=d. The same vintage as the I-35 Bridge that collapsed in 
Minnesota back in 200=, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The antiquated Skagit River Bridge in Washington State that 
collapsed last May after a truck hit one of the truss=s was even older. And it's not just bridges. According to the 
American So=iety of Civil Engineers, 32 percent of the major roads in America are now in poor condition and in need of 
major repairs. Yet the major source of revenue -- =he federal Highway Trust Fund, which gets its money from the federal 
gas tax o= 18 cents a gallon -- is almost insolvent. Former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood says it will go broke by 
next spring unless something is done. 
And the pro=lems with transportation infrastructure go well beyond roads and bridges and the gas tax. There's aviation. 
A sho=tage of airports runways and gates along outmoded air traffic control systems have made U.S. air travel the most 
congested in the world. And then there are seaports: when a new generation =f big cargo ships begin going through an 
expanded Panama Canal in another yea= or so, only two of the 14 major ports on the East Coast will be dredged deep 
enough to accommodate them. There are more than 14,000 miles of high-speed rail operating around the world, but 
n=ne in the United States. In Chicago, it can take a freight train nearly as long to go across the city, as it would for =he 
same train to go from Chicago to Los Angeles. But perhaps the most gl=ring example of neglect and inaction may be this 
sad little railroad bridge over the Hacken=ack River in New Jersey. It was built 104 years ago and is, according to Amtrak 
President and CEO Joe Boardman, criti=al to the U.S. economy. 
=p class="MsoNormal">"This is the Achilles heel that we have on the Northeast Corridor",</=>"It's almost 500 trains a 
day. It's the busiest bridge in the Western Hemisph=re for train traffic, period." "It's safe 
, but it&#=9;s not reliable. 
And it's getting less reliable. It's old. Its systems are breaking down. There's an =nability to make it work on a regular, 
reliable basis." Boardman says the Portal Bridge is based on a design from the 1840s and was already obsolete shortly 
after it was completed in 1910. It'sra swing bridge that needs to be opened several times a week so barges can pass up 
and down the river. It takes abo=t a half an hour. The problem is it fails to lock back into place on a regular basis. Joe 
Boardman: It causes trains to stack up on both sides. And actually, when a train stacks up here, it can stack up all the 
way down to Washington=and all the way back up to Boston. This is a single point of failure. That's one of the biggest 
worries we have on this corridor is these single points of failure. Amtrak's president says the bridge has to be replaced, 
the design work has already been completed, and =he project, which would cost just under a billion dollars, is shovel 
ready.40=A0 Therefore, If Congress wants to do something now, build this bridge. It's ready to be done. It's been read= 
for two years. Build it. It's tangible evidence that they can r=ally get something done. 
a class="MsoNormal">The American Society of Civil Engineers says that to protect the =ealth, safety, and welfare of the 
public, the country needs to seriously need to improve the nation's public infrastructure. And to achieve that goal it 
estimates the country needs to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020. But none of this isn't going to happen until the countr= has 
the political will to make fixing the country's infrastructure a priority. And for a reminder one of the bridges that you will 
be crossing probably has a failing grade... The goal for any great civilization is to leav= more for the descendants. 
Obviously this is not the thinking of toda='s leadership.... Everyone knew that levies in New Orleans were = problem 
prior to Katrina, just like people in Sacramento, CA know th=t their levies could easily fail as well... Why then do we have 
to w=it until the disaster happens to address the problem? <=p>
