This situation cannot continue. Oslo succeeded in bringing bac= 250,000 Palestinians from the diaspora and building the 
capacity for our =tate. The international community failed though, by granting Israel an unp=ecedented culture of 
impunity that allowed them to use negotiations as a means to continue rather than stop c=lonization. 
FP: What is the most important thing Israelis don't understand=about Palestinians? 
SE: That we are not going anywhere. As simple as that. We are not g=ing to disappear just because their government 
builds an annexation wall a=ound us. 
They should close their eyes and imagin= their state within 10 years time. What do they see? If they continue thei= 
policies, they are going to officially adopt the form of an apartheid reg=me, which I think is not what many Israelis want. 
FP: What is the most important thing Palestinians have learned abou= Israelis? 
SE: That Israelis will not take back the ships that brought them he=e to leave somewhere else. We got to understand 
that we have to live side =y side. The rules of engagement, though, cannot be those of apartheid, but those of freedom. 
FP: What do you expect from the next Israeli government on the peac= process? 
SE: I don't think there is room for optimism, but our position hasn=t changed. We don't see any other solution than a 
two-state solution. Any =sraeli government that recognizes this fact and respects what previous governments have 
agreed upon should become=a partner for peace. 
FP: Is Hamas-Fatah unity possible, and what would the impact be on =he future of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? 
SE: We expect to have progress in the near future, with Hamas allow=ng the Central Elections Commission to register 
new voters in Gaza. I beli=ve there is political agreement -- in fact, there is a signed agreement. We expect to have 
elections as soon =s possible, which is the right way to solve our differences: Let our peopl= decide, those in Palestine as 
well as our people in the Diaspora. 
Having said so, Hamas has recognized th= Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole and legitimate representati=e of 
the Palestinian people, including its mandate to negotiate a final st=tus agreement with Israel. Once that is achieved, we 
expect to hold a national referendum. 
FP: How would you describe Egypt's role in the peace process now? W=at do you expect from President Barack Obama's 
administration with regards=to the peace process? 
SE: Egypt has played a central role, and continues to do so. We tru=t that Egypt, under President Mohamed Morsy's 
leadership, will continue to=play a strong role because Palestine and Egypt have a common interest in achieving peace. 
President Obama had stated that he has = personal commitment to bring peace to the Middle East. We, the 
Egyptians,=and the rest of the Arab world tell him that we are ready for peace. We ha=e the Arab Peace Initiative. This 
goes in line with the stated U.S. national interest. Washington's failure =o explicitly say that Israel is to blame for 
choosing settlements over pea=e has contributed to Israel's culture of impunity. 
FP: Can America be an effective broker in negotiations? 
SE: If the U.S. decides to be an honest broker, it could not only b= effective but in fact could bring real peace to the 
region, a just and la=ting one. The U.S. has a moral obligation toward the Palestinian people, who have been under 
occupation and living i= exile for decades. 
FP: Is a two state solution still possible?
