I was always a listening =ar for you. You know, I remember your story of a chance meeting on a=rainy day that

why in your life you strayed to find recognition from the public and =erhaps that was your downfall, after leading such a

as to why you had such a drive in life or why you became who you are..C2* In my eyes, your mission was to free

You always said to me, "Ask yourself whether it=could hurt you". This was whenever I was unsure to take a ri=k

was able to relieve myself of bottling my exper=ences. Sometimes what we do in life affects people more than we can

I know life is short and =n the grand scheme of things and the shit we are dealt are sometimes lesso=s we need

obviously I don't know why som=times I feel so concerned, not only because I have been brought into thing= in the past, 
that you are okay. I think it is because I still care.= 
With all the experiences I was privileged to thro=gh you, I will always be grateful and I must let you know that. 
But =et me tell you, coming back to my little small reality that you could neve= understand how I provided for myself on
