viral social media phenomenon." Sunday's call came as the President "has expressed repeated 
concerns about TikTok and concerns around national security in recent weeks." In a statement, 
Microsoft said it "fully appreciates the importance of addressing the president's concerns. It is 
committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper 
economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury." 
The Washington Post (8/2, Lerman, 14.2M) and USA Today (8/2, Tyko, 10.31M), among 
other news outlets, also report the phone call, while Reuters (8/3, Roumeliotis, Wang) reports 
exclusively that the President "has agreed to give China's ByteDance 45 days to negotiate a 
sale" of TikTok to Microsoft. 
The New York Times (7/31, Isaac, Swanson, 18.61M) says lawmakers "and the Trump 
administration have increasingly questioned whether TikTok is susceptible to influence from the 
Chinese government, including potential requests to censor material shared on the platform or 
to share American user data with Chinese officials." According to the Times, TikTok "has been 
under review since late last year by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, 
a federal panel that examines foreign acquisitions of American firms for national security 
threats." However, the Washington Post (7/31, Al, Nakashima, Lerman, 14.2M) reports on its 
front page that TikTok "has continually insisted it does not hand over information to the Chinese 
government." 
USA Today (7/31, Jackson, Subramanian, Fritze, 10.31M) reports that on Friday, the 
President "threatened" to "ban TikTok from operating in the U.S. over concerns about the social 
media platform's ties with China." The President said, "As far as TikTok is concerned, we're 
banning them from the United States." 
In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal (7/31, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) calls 
Microsoft's potential move to buy US owned operations of Chinese-owned video app TikTok a 
possible example of increasing business competition while also solving a political problem. The 
Journal concludes Microsoft has the resources to go through with the investment and would 
offer competition to social media giants. 
Pompeo Criticizes China's Treatment Of Uighurs. Pompeo, on Fox News' Sunday 
Morning FuturesVi (8/2, 1.47M), also discussed China's treatment of the Uighurs, saying, "The 
risk to the people in that region has been great. I've talked about this as the greatest human 
rights violation to this date. If you want to participate in the world stage, you can't participate 
in behavior like this. We've begun to impose sanctions by companies and individuals involved in 
this. The most recent sanctions will put businesses operating there on notice, they have to 
change their behavior, stop using slave labor, stop participating in systems that have been 
connected to forced sterilization. ... We told US businesses take a real deep look into their 
supply chains and companies, some brand names in company, don't want to be connected to 
what's taking place there." 
Canadian Attorney General Says Requirements Have Been Met To Extradite Huawei 
CFO To US. 
Reuters (7/31, Warburton) reports Canadian Minister of Justice and Attorney General David 
Lametti "says the requirements for extraditing Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to 
the United States on charges of bank fraud have been met, documents submitted in a British 
Columbia court show." The documents "are a precursor to the formal hearing on committal, or 
whether Meng should be extradited to the United States. Those hearings will take place in April 
2021. 
House Votes To Allot $500M Toward Election Security. 
The Washington Times (7/31, Blake, 492K) reports the House of Representatives "voted Friday 
to allocate a half-billion dollars toward strengthening and securing U.S. elections as part of a 
giant spending bill unlikely to face similar success in the Senate." The "$500 million to be given 
out in grants made available by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, or EAC," is included in
