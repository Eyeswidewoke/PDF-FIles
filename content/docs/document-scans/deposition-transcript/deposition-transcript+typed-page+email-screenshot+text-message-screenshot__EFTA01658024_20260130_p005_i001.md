December, attorneys for Tsarnaev "had pointed to 22 Twitter posts and retweets by the jury's 
forewoman - one referring to Mr. Tsarnaev as `that piece of garbage' - that had not been 
voluntarily disclosed as part of jury screening." 
The Washington Post (7/31, Sacchetti, 14.2M) reports the case is going to return "to the 
lower court for additional hearings, but the court's overturning of the death sentences does not 
mean Tsarnaev will have an opportunity to get out of prison." The court said, "Dzhokhar will 
remain confined to prison for the rest of his life, with the only question remaining being 
whether the government will end his life by executing him." The Post adds, "Tsarnaev's federal 
defenders said in a statement Friday that they were `grateful for the Court's straightforward and 
fair decision." 
The AP (7/31, Richer) reports, "A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals ordered a new penalty-phase trial on whether the 27-year-old Tsarnaev should be 
executed for the attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. `But make 
no mistake: Dzhokhar will spend his remaining days locked up in prison, with the only matter 
remaining being whether he will die by execution,' Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson wrote in the 
ruling, more than six months after arguments were heard in the case." Prosecutors "could ask 
the full appeals court to hear the case or go straight to the U.S. Supreme Court." 
USA Today (7/31, Garrison, 10.31M) reports, "Prior to his sentencing, attorneys for 
Tsarnaev, 19 at the time of the bombings, agreed their client was responsible for the deaths but 
contended he was less culpable than his accomplice, older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was 
killed by authorities following a four-day manhunt. A fourth victim, an MIT police officer, was 
shot and killed by the Tsarnaev brothers during the manhunt. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defense 
attorneys argued during a December appeal hearing he did not receive a fair trial in Boston 
before he was sentenced to death, pointing to relentless media coverage in the city where the 
bombing occurred and city-wide trauma that `filtered' into the jury pool. They said two jurors 
lied by concealing prejudiced remarks made on social media about the case before the trial." 
Reuters (7/31, Raymond) reports that Judge Thompson "said the trial judge `fell short' in 
conducting the jury selection process and screening jurors for potential bias following pretrial 
publicity surrounding the high-profile case. Thompson said the pervasive news coverage of the 
bombings and their aftermath featured `bone-chilling' photos and videos of Tsarnaev, now 27, 
and his brother carrying backpacks at the marathon and of those injured and killed near its 
finish line. Thompson said the judge deemed jurors eligible who had `already formed an opinion 
that Dzhokhar was guilty - and he did so in large part because they answered "yes" to the 
question whether they could decide this high-profile case based on the evidence." 
The Hill (7/31, Moreno, 2.98M) reports, "Tsarnaev's lawyers have argued that his 
sentencing trial should not be held in Boston, where jurors have been exposed to heavy local 
and national media coverage of the attack and its aftermath." 
The AP (8/1, Mustian, Ring) reports, "'Boston Strong' remains a `vibrant' rallying cry more 
than seven years after the marathon bombing killed three people and injured more than 260 
others, a federal appeals court noted as it threw out the death sentence of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev," 
but "even as the ruling opened old wounds, it raised familiar questions about whether Tsarnaev 
can receive a fair hearing in the city where the bombs exploded — a community that may now 
be asked to relive unspeakable trauma." The AP adds, "The Justice Department is expected to 
appeal. Legal observers predict prosecutors will turn straight to the U.S. Supreme Court without 
asking for a hearing before the full 1st Circuit. The U.S. government recently resumed federal 
executions following a 17-year pause and, under President Donald Trump, has pursued capital 
punishment in an increasing number of cases." The Hill (8/2, Klar, 2.98M), the Springfield (MA). 
Republican (8/2, Croteau, 395K), and the Boston Globe (8/1, Crimaldi, 972K) also report. 
The Wall Street Journal (7/31, Kamp, Randazzo, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) as well 
as brief CBS Evening NewsVi (7/31, story 12, 0:19, O'Donnell, 3.97M) and NBC Nightly NewsVi 
(7/31, story 11, 0:20, Holt, 5.44M) broadcasts provided similar coverage.
