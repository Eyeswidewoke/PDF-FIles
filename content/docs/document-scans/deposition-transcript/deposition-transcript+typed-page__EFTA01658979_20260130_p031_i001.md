marry," Barrett refused to indicate whether the case "was correctly decided," and the Post says 
that her doing that "frustrated Senate Democrats and alarmed LGBTQ activists, who worry 
about her elevation to a Supreme Court that has only three justices remaining from the five-
member majority in the 2015 decision." 
Pence To Continue Campaigning Even After Top Staffers Test Positive. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/25, Bender, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Vice President 
Pence, the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, will continue to campaign on 
behalf of President Trump even though he was in close contact with Chief of Staff Marc Short, 
who tested positive for COVID on Saturday. Sources told the Journal that Pence adviser Marty 
Obst and at least three other staff in the Vice President's office have also tested positive. 
In the lead story on ABC World News TonightVI (10/25, lead story, 3:30, Llamas, 4.45M), 
Rachel Scott reported that Short "was by the Vice President's side at several campaign stops in 
the past week," including "an Ohio rally Friday." CNN (10/25, Diaz, Klein, 83.16M) reports on its 
website that according to two sources, one of the staffers who tested positive was Zach Bauer, 
"Pence's `body man,' meaning his job is to accompany Pence throughout the day and night 
helping him with a wide range of duties, putting him in close proximity to the vice president," 
but a source "told CNN that Bauer has not been in the office since Tuesday, when he went home 
to quarantine after coming into contact with Obst. Bauer tested positive Saturday." 
However, Kelly O'Donnell reported on NBC Nightly NewsVi (10/25, lead story, 2:40, Snow, 
3.43M) that aides "say [the Vice President] and the second lady tested negative again" on 
Sunday, so "he headed to North Carolina." According to O'Donnell, "Top White House officials 
defend that choice, calling candidate Pence an essential worker." O'Donnell added, "Under CDC 
guidance, essential workers should wear masks and keep distance, but are not required to stay 
home 14 days." She also reported the Vice President's aides "say he has canceled local 
interviews in order to keep distance, and also dropped the usual practice politicians have of 
what's known as a rope line, a chance to greet supporters after event events, like the rally he's 
holding now. That's been dropped as well. He will be traveling this week with stops in Minnesota 
and the Carolinas on his agenda." 
The AP (10/25, Colvin, Weissert, Miller, Madhani) reports Pence "has an aggressive travel 
schedule planned for the final days of the campaign," while CNN (10/25, Cole, 83.16M) reports 
on its website that Pence "emerged maskless from Air Force Two in Florida, running down the 
steps and jogging across the tarmac, fist pumping as he approached the podium." 
The AP (10/25, Miller, Colvin) reports President Trump "commented on Short early Sunday 
after his plane landed at Joint Base Andrews, outside Washington." Trump said, 
did hear 
about it just now." He added, "I think he's quarantining. Yeah. I did hear about it. He's going to 
be fine. But he's quarantining." 
In the lead story on the CBS Weekend NewsVI (10/25, lead story, 3:20, Yuccas, 9.26M), 
Paula Reid said that on CBS' Face The Nation, Margaret Brennan pressed National Security 
Advisor O'Brien, "who also had the virus earlier this year, on Pence's refusal to quarantine." 
O'Brien said, "The free election is foundation of our democracy, so I think campaigning and 
voting are the most essential thing we can be doing." O'Brien added, "I think is he taking all the 
precautions and my understanding is he tested negative as has the second lady." 
Chief of Staff Meadows, on CNN's State Of The UnionVi (10/25, 1.29M), said, "Obviously 
Mark Short and a couple of the key staff around the Vice President have come down with the 
coronavirus. It just goes to show you that we continue to face this enemy that came from China 
and, yet, what we also know is the one area that where we are rounding the corner is really the 
death rate. Our ability to handle this has improved each and every day and each and every 
month. When there were estimates that as many as 10% of the population that got this would 
actually experience a fatal result, you know, we are now down to 2.6%. Every death is too 
many. But hopefully we are going to get this to the point where it's not as lethal as the flu."
