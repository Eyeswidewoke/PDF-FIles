Subject: 
for your leon meeting. &nbs=; . 1. at our meeting he said he took the position that torn an= joslin knew the rules better 
than I . 2. he really had =o interest in any email document or explanation that conflicted with his self serving narrative 
3. He said he never agreed to a 50.60 m =ollar fee though their is one email after another laying out diifferent me=hods 
of paying the 60 as he was cash short. in fact one =as to keep 30 m outstanding on the credit line WHICH THEY DID ! 
No other reason to do it . Only after the transacti=n and all its details were completed By me on the phone doing it 
pe=sonally as he was on his boat did he say this is the amount i think =ou should receive. 
re Anastasia. first she cr=fted false documents. second she told the agent that she had n= time for biz as she was in 
school !!! , however only 2 months=before she had applied for a business , NOT student, visa. ! ( VERYVERY BAD ) . He 
ignores the fact that he has paid MILLIONS&n=sp; of dollars to RUSSIAN girls. and cant understand why they are 
su=picious?? 
FYI anas Crazy issues came to light&n=sp; months after the 30 million note was done ( i add- =soley 
as a favor to him to save him millions of dollars by having a 1031 ta= free exchange with ME!!. Ask him how many 
other friends woul= put up 30 m without a single document . I used my money not h=s. I bought two items that were 
supposed to be sold in 2 week= according to him and gagosian , it turned out to b= one year. no benefit at all to me 
- ZERO.! &nbs=;much bookeeping taxes to pay, all on my side. &nb=p; . Anastasias lies came to light months after 
thisv103= transaction 4 months to be precise. . . no answer for why she did anything she d=d. . if asked i will 
need to disclose the 10=1 . which will cost him more than the 30 much as it will=open up all previous 1031 s which 
are horrible &nbs=; not done by me or with my guidance. .plus plus My bet is he will say that he will pay part of 
phaidon benefi=. . and then want my help , as he does iwith Anasatasita =for free. 
i leave it to you. Good luck=nbsp;
