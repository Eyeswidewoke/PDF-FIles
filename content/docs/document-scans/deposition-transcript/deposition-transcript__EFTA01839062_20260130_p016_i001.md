fingerprints and DNA by the police. But she did not do so and the room instead of being a crime 
scene was immediately rented out. 
When a witness is untruthful under oath, and, in doing so, obstructs the investigation, 
prosecutors have a serious problem. In addition, they found she had told many other falsehoods. It 
also developed that soon after DSK had been arrested she discussed with her fiancee DSK's ample 
financial resources. Since her fiancé was in prison at the time on drug charges, the conversation 
was recorded. While a victim is entitled to recover financial damages, this conversation night by 
used by DSK's lawyers in cross-examination to suggest she had a financial motive. She was also 
vulnerable because she had made possible fraudulent statements elsewhere for financial gain. For 
example, she admitted that she repeatedly excluded her earnings from the Sofitel from her low 
cost housing applications so as to be eligible for lower rent. After extensive interviews, the 
prosecutors noted "In sum, the complainant has been persistently, and at times inexplicably 
untruthful in describing matters of both great and small significance. In our repeated interviews 
with her, the complete truth about the charged incident and her background has, for that reason, 
remained elusive." So she was not a witness whose credit ability they could recommend to a jury. 
Nor did the other evidence prove force was used. The DNA samples taken from Diallo's 
clothing and the carpet of the interior hallway in the presidential suite showed that there had been 
a sexual encounter between Diallo and DSK, but they in themselves did not show that it was 
forced. Neither did the medical examinations. Diallo claimed DSK had dragged her around the 
suite but when both parties were examined at the hospital, and scrapings were taken from under 
their finger nails, doctors could find no clear signs that force was used by DSK to overpower 
Diallo. Five weeks later, her lawyers reported that an MRI showed a "SLAP type 2 tear" in her 
left shoulder, but when the prosecutors' expert orthopedic surgeon examined the MRI, he 
concluded that the injury had not been sustained during her encounter with DSK, but well 
afterwards and in his opinion had been self-induced by "repeated overhead use of the upper 
extremity." So the prosecutor could find no medical evidence, other than an injury its own expert 
said was caused by Diallo herself after the incident, that proved the encounter was not consensual. 
By the end of July, had changed her story on this chronology at least three times leaving it 
uncertain which, if any, of these versions is true. The prosecutors came to the conclusion that they 
could not bring this case to trial. In August, the task of preparing a recommendation for dismissal 
of all the charges was given to assistant district attorneys Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, a well-regarded 
prosecutor who by June had become "second chair" to McConnell. Her initial analysis of the case 
was 74 pages in length because Illuzzi-Orbon covered areas in the case that might have been 
peripheral to the issue of dismissing the charges. As this was to be a public document, some of 
these areas might have raised additional problems for the district attorney's office. For example, 
there was DNA and saliva evidence that involved 6 people other than DSK and Diallo. Since it 
was doubtful that the enzyme marker in the saliva could survive many room cleaning, the 
implication that other similar sex acts recently had been performed in the same part of the 
presidential suite could perhaps unfairly damage reputations. According to a source in the district 
attorney's office, the report was reduced to 25 pages to minimize issues not directly connected to 
the court case. 
On August 22", the prosecutors submitted a 25-page recommendation for dismissal of all the 
charges. It was signed by Illuzzi-Orbon and McConnell, who wrote in the submitted motion,"the 
nature and number of the complainant's falsehoods leave us unable to credit her version of events 
beyond a reasonable doubt." They said that Diallo "has given irreconcilable accounts of what
