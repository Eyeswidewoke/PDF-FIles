"Mr. Steward was =ontracted to provide services as a temporary landscaper for the Island =fter the 
Hurricanes. His role was to perform needed landscape =rojects until the Island was restored back to normal. 
Accordingly =e was not brought on as a permanent employee. Rather he was =ontracted solely for the post-hurricane 
restoration =rojects" 
3. The questionnaire also includes =he following instructions: 
"Attach copies =/span>of =/span>any =ritten agreements, billing statements, applications, or contracts 
=etween the firm and the worker. If the agreement was oral, please =educe it to writing and attach. If any State or 
Federal Agency has ruled on the same job class as this worker or another =/span>of =/span>the =ame job class, attach a 
copy of the ruling. =These documents will not be returned.)" 
a Daphne proposed to include: all =heck stubs for checks issued to Kyle which generally indicate number 
of =ays worked and the daily rate. Excluding the =eparate check stub relating to the Christmas Bonus (discussed in 3b 
=elow), there are 44 check stubs relating to payments to Kyle Steward =ating back to October 2017. I think the =heck 
stubs would be requested anyway and would provide them. =hris Kroblin agrees and thinks we should provide the 
check =tubs. 
b With regard to check stubs, there =re two additional separate issues: There is a check =tub which is 
separate and states that it is a "Christmas =onus" as per JE. I suppose that providing Kyle a =hristmas Bonus could make 
it seem like Kyle is being treated as an =mployee. Not sure if you want to include the stub or delete it. =nbsp; 
c. Second check stub issue. It =s my understanding that Kyle's pay was $240 less than it =ormally is 
during one period. Apparently, Stephanie loaned him =240 to cover the shortfall out of petty cash. He had not paid the 
=oan back, so, when he was let go, there was a deduction from his pay in =he amount of that loan (silly). The check stub 
makes a reference =o the deduction for the loan repayment. Does the loan of =240 make it seem more like he is being 
treated as an employee? =nbsp; 
d. Daphne also included invoices =ssued with respect to each payment made to Kyle, but the invoices 
reflect billing at an hourly rate, rather than the daily rate reflected =n the check stubs, and the invoices were prepared 
by the office rather =han Kyle. I think that the fact that we prepared the invoices =ould come out during the process 
=e.g., if asked about invoices, Kyle would likely say he =ever prepared or gave us any invoices). Also, that the invoices 
=how payment at an hourly rate, which is different than the daily rate =n the check stubs, creates confusion and might 
cause =dditional scrutiny. I think that our preparing the invoices =ould reflect negatively and would work against us, so I 
have excluded =he invoices. 
e. Daphne also included the =ndemnity agreement that we make all contractors, vendors and suppliers 
=ign and which states that the person signing the agreement is a =ontractor, vendor or supplier. Under this agreement 
the person =ho signs it indemnifies Nautilus, Inc., Great St. Jim, LLC, LSJE, LLC =nd you for any personal injury claims 
arising out of the engagement as = contractor. It includes an assumption of the risk with respect =o dangerous 
conditions and activities on the properties, a release and = waiver of claims. I think it could cut both ways because it 
=ooks like we make people waive certain rights to work for us. On =he other hand, as Chris Kroblin indicated, the people 
who do this are =ot rocket scientists and are simply looking at the universe of =actors they have been told makes 
someone a contractor or =mployee. The document clearly states the mutual understanding =hat Kyle is a contractor, is 
responsible for his own evaluation of the =onditions on the property and for his own conduct, requires him to =aintain 
his own insurance and provides additional support for treatment =f Kyle as a contractor. Also, because we want to
