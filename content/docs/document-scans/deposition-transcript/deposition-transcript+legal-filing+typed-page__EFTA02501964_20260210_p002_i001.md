=/div>2 music , most animals make sounds.Q=A0 what does music represent. it is melody prosody, info=amtion 
both verticaland horizonal. chords melody. = as it is generated from the brain can it be reversed engineered and used 
=o probe] the workings of the machine tha creatied it. . listei=g to a flute, and its tonal quality from the sound 
analy=isi , a long empyt tube can be postualted. but thats only its =tructure, rythms are a product of the player not 
only th= structure. do german marches provide insite into a german mind.Q=A0 is it organized regulaid. beats that 
range from 30 - =2 bpm. do afro americnacs. think more like jazz.=C2* somewhat off the beat. ( humor. 
unpredictable movements =aking it harder for a german to tackle down the field.. ). Q=AO why do soldiers march 
further to music, runners run f=rther. . A symphonic structure is theme repe=ition vaitaion on the themes 
conclusion. the same dictum=given to public speakers. tell them what you are going to say,=C2. say it , tell them 
what you said. 
3. mathe=atics is the search for truth. algorithms that do not ch=nge there result with the passing of the day. . 
mathematics st=nds outside of time. the ideal of a point or line ( separte from ein=teins measuemrnt issues as the 
actaul measurement is much more diffculttA0 . requiring a beggining and and end therefore measurement lives i= 
time space. mathematics is the search for truth. =C2I> I postualte that Biology and biological systems differ from 
mathemat=cs beacuse it is needs deception to survive. biological systems only make =ense in time space. , trying to 
stay away from what is the mom=nt of life or death. . predator prey. biuoog=cal systems need free energy in order to 
maintain structure dissinte=raing from entropy, eneygy needs to be ingested inorder =o fight the slope down to 
breaking apart and returning to dust. 40=A0 . getting energy, the most basic bio requiremen=. in bio systems 
however the best way to get energy is either =rom the sun, a limtied chenical reaction or heat gradisent. the ener=y 
must come from outside. the way for systems to gain enery is=to eat it. the way not to die is to eat andnot be eaten.. 
the game =f eat or not be eaten is very sophisticated what is the =ntity . the cell. the organ , the organism . the 
community 4)=AO on and on. heirarchila nested systems. at=every level decision have to be made , is it ok to 
sacrifice a few c=lls so that the organism can live. which cells. do=they get a choice? how many when . when the 
organism is =aten by its predator. how did it try to protect itself. =amaflouge, surrounding itself in junk, mimicryy, 
misdirection, misin=ormation. etc.. qurum sensing game theory, free wi=l, bait, ants, . 
4 we have come a long way in sur=eillance and detecting and encoding and decoding communticaions betw=en people 
between computers, . we can do this beacuse we can p=ck out the words in text, embed it in a grammar space, 
4).=A0we know the language/ 
we need to do the same now=for biology, what is the language of the cells. do they 
=ommuncat with proteins, . what are they saying to each other, is teh=oanaguage encrypted , does each person have 
his onw code.Q=A0 is it chemcial or elctrical or both. or physical like=the shape of the protein fiiting in a lolck, or 
combination of all three.=C24> the protein fits. the electri is fired, etc. does the brain send a m=ssage. what does 
medicine do. does it fool the receiver =he sender. the listener. the history of telemommincaiotns inte=cepts have a 
long histroy referring to alice and bob that would like=to speak to each other, they encript their messages..=A0 so 
that a listener cannot do damge. . why not a=tack the bio language the same way as speech. 
have=nsa work on 
decrypting the differnce in signals from a cancer =ell as opposed to a helathy one. we know that cells send out 
messagest=A0 , am i in the right place. if they get no answer or t=e wrong aswer they are programeed to commit 
suicicde. when a f=reigner shows up in a neighborhhod that is hostile , he is sur=ounded. killed and moved into the 
trash. he can ma=querade as a local. how can the other cells tell. =an they ask him who won the world series. ? . 
maybe an equival=nt. friend or foe, ? decoding skills find it difficutl t= decipher if there is no repitition or action that is 
the result of =he message. the famous example separate from heil hitler=at teh end of the message ( anecdote or true 
). to break a cod= that was recieved from the germans the allies planed a bomb in thre= citie all set to blow at teh 
same time, they thoguth that the=word for bank or bomb would be in the message for the day.. or so t=e story goes. 
money what =s it . is it a mirage that disappears when you look too closely,Q=A0 can you have money without debt, 
is it an accounting =ystem. what and whys of itnerest. was it for small=communities. ? with the same currency, what 
is the dirrency beteen c=rency and money, what is the meaing of value,? cos=. market. what is a derivative, futures ,
