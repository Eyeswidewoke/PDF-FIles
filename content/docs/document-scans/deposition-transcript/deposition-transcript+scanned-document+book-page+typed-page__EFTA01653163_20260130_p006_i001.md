SEC Rethinking Plans To Alter Whistleblower 
Program, Sources Say. 
The Securities and Exchange 
Commission "is rethinking a proposal that could weaken a 
landmark whistleblower program after a pushback from 
whistleblower lawyers and advocates, people with knowledge 
of the deliberations told" Reuters (11/15, Johnson, Prentice), 
which reports the program "is widely considered a major 
success, resulting in more than $2 billion in penalties against 
firms such as JPMorgan and Bank of America and $387 
million in rewards. Weakening the program would hamper the 
agency's ability to detect and prosecute white collar crime, 
say lawyers." 
Trump Highlights Taylor, Kent Reluctance To 
Identify "Impeachable Offense." 
In a tweet 
Thursday, President Trump highlighted that in their testimony 
Thursday, Acting Ukraine Ambassador William Taylor and 
State Department official George Kent did not respond when 
Rep. John Ratdiffe (R-TX) called on them to identify the 
"impeachable offense" in his call with Ukrainian President 
Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump wrote, "@RepRatcliffe asked the 
two 'star witnesses, 'where is the impeachable event in that 
call?' Both stared straight ahead with a blank look on their 
face, remained silent, & were unable to answer the question. 
That would be the end of a case run by normal people! — but 
not Shifty!"

Against Investigating Political Rivals. The Washington 
Examiner (11/14, Gehrke, 448K) reports that Acting Ukraine 
Ambassador William Taylor and State Department official 
George Kent testified last month that a Sept. 14 meeting led 
by Kurt Volker, the State Departments lead negotiator for the 
war in Ukraine at the time, "deteriorated into an angry 
confrontation: Taylor was present at the meeting along with 
Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak. Taylor and 
Kent testified that in the meeting, 'Volker discouraged 
Ukrainian officials from investigating former President Petro 
Poroshenko, whom current President Volodymyr Zelensky 
defeated in April: Volker "argued that it is wrong to use the 
judicial system to target political rivals. But Zelensky's aide 
dismissed that rebuke by invoking Trump's desire for 
investigations into Democratic politicians." The Examiner 
says the exchange "underscores the Zelensky team's 
perception that they were being pressured to accuse Biden of 
corruption in order to help President Trump's reelection 
campaign."

Ukrainian government in an attempt to get them to get 
information on a political rival, i.e. Joe Biden.-

employee" at OMB "is expected to break ranks and testify 
Saturday in the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry,

aid to Ukraine." The Post says OMB has so far 'served as a 
bulwark for President Trump against the impeachment 
inquiry, since top officials have refused to testify." The Post

importance of Sandy's testimony and criticized" House 
Speaker Pelosi and House Intelligence Chairman Adam 
Schiff 'for calling him to testify: The official said, "With 
nothing to show after three years trying to impeach the 
President, Speaker Pelosi and Rep. Schiff have resorted to 
threatening dedicated civil servants with subpoenas and 
depositions without the ability to even have agency counsel 
present."
