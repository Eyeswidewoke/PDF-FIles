they could only find part-time work, or because business was slow—up from 4.3 million in October 2007. 
Often, low-wage workers need to be employed for a few months or years before their bosses give them 
full-time work. So workers know that quitting a low-paying, part-time job to find another will rarely yield 
a better situation. 
Although they have a job, many workers are left unable to pay the bills, and unable to better their 
situation. 
On a recent weekday, I spoke with two workers in this situation outside a Dunkin' Donuts in a town in a 
rural, eastern part of Vermont. They were on a short break, sitting in a car in the bitter cold, and agreed 
to talk to me if I didn't use their real names, since both badly need the work. One, let's call her Jessie, is 
26 and pregnant. She makes $9 an hour, $1.50 less than she made when she worked for the chain 
between 2008 and 2011. 
Jessie was working 40 hours a week all summer, but as tourist season ended, business slowed and she 
now gets only 30 hours a week. She found a second job babysitting, but it's made her employer give her 
even fewer hours, she said, since she isn't available at all times. 
"They give you a bunch of crap because you're not working with the schedule and you should be flexible 
to the needs of the company," she said. 
She still gets calls at odd hours telling her that the schedule has changed, that she is opening on Friday, 
rather than closing, for example. But she puts up with it, because she lives in a rural town, and "unless I 
want to be a professional gas station attendant, there's nothing." 
Neither Jessie nor her fellow Dunkin Donuts employee, who I'll call Leslie, had heard of Vermont's Right 
to Request law. 
"I definitely would have made a big stink about it all summer if I had known," Jessie said, about the law. 
Vermont was one of the first places in the country to try to get a handle on inconsistent scheduling. But 
more cities and states are looking into passing laws as well. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors last 
week unanimously passed the Retail Workers Bill of Rights, which would require retailers to offer extra 
hours to current, part-time employees before hiring additional employees, and would give workers extra 
pay if their schedule is changed at the last minute. And a Michigan state Senator introduced a bill last 
month that would require employers to pay workers for extra hours when they change schedules 
without notice. A federal "Schedules that Work Act," introduced in Congress this summer, seeks to solve 
some of the same problems. 
"Here's the thing: If we raise wages but don't stabilize people's schedules, what does it do for them?" 
said Liz Watson, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center, which has been pushing for laws 
that would require more predictable schedules. "This is something that folks are really conscious of right 
now, this is something we are going to be hearing more and more about." 
Protections for scheduling changes in places like Vermont and San Francisco are sending employers the 
message, she said, that they can't continue to operate with such unpredictability in hours. 
But the experience of Vermont indicates employers might not be getting the message. Even if wage-and-
hour laws change, companies still operate on the same profit margins. And store managers are even
