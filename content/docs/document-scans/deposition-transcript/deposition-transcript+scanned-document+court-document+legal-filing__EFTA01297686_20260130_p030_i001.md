denied. A court will not oppose the will of the majority stockholders on behalf of the minority stockholders unless it is 
shown that the action contemplated or taken is clearly contrary to the true interest of the corporation itself.

OPINION BY: HECHT, JR. 
OPINION 
r l033I 1**771I In this representative stockholders' action plaintiff, a holder of 750 of the outstanding 590.960 shares 
of defendant. Unitronics Corporation, applies for an injunction restraining the corporation, its officers, directors, agents 
and attorneys, from voting any shares of stock owned or controlled by them or any proxies obtained by them from 
stockholders, at the special meeting of stockholders called for September II, 1957. or any adjournment thereof, in favor 
of the proposed merger of defendant with and into The Siegler Corporation or, in the alternative. in the event of 
approval of such merger by the stockholders of defendant. from taking any action designed to effectuate or consummate 
such merger. 
The first pan of the application need not be considered inasmuch as the court did not stay the meeting of stockholders 
which took place on September I I, 1957. At this meeting. of 590,963 outstanding shares of common stock of 
Unitronics, the holders of which were entitled to vote on such proposal, 482,093 shares, constituting 82% of such 
outstanding shares, were represented by proxy or in person at such meeting. The holders I *9 *3 I of 469,726 shares. 
representing 80% of the outstanding shares voted by proxy or in person in favor of such proposal. The holders of 
12,367 shares, representing 2% of the outstanding shares, voted by proxy or in person against such proposal. 
1•10341 The test to be applied to an application of this nature was succinctly stated by Peelcham. J.. in Gamble v. 
Queens County Water Co. (123 N. Y. 91.99): me47."To warrant the interposition of the court in favor of the minority 
stockholders in a corporation or joint-stock association, as against the contemplated action of the majority, where such 
action is within the corporate powers. a case must be made out which plainly shows that such action is so far opposed to 
the true interests of the corporation itself as to lead to the clear inference that no one thus acting could 
have 1**7721 been influenced by any honest desire to secure such interests, but that he must have acted with an intent 
to subsen•c some outside purpose. regardless of the consequences to the cotnpany and in a manner inconsistent with its 
interests." 
Plaintiff lo.941 has failed to meet this test by a wide margin. Motion denied.
