2. As we all know I aint no tax guy but I read the assessment letter very carefully and my "uninformed" 
view is exactly torn and Jeffrey's first reaction (which may or may not have changed), ie, that the IRS 
found/acknowledges 378,805,695 of what they believe should be 379,707,381 or a delta of 884,006. (They also found a 
delta of 17,680 in itemized deductions.) Definitionally, these numbers have to include BRH numbers and as jeffrey said 
to me, they answered the question they posed in the initial notice. 
The "delta" in income is not a result of an audit of Leon's tax return. The "delta" is Leon's (BFP's) 
allocable share of the adjustment of BRH Holdings, LP ordinary income 
as a result of an audit of the tax return of BRH Holdings. The issue is on the BRH partnership return. 
Suzanne Wong (or someone at Apollo or Deloitte) should be able to 
provide a copy of the IRS audit report explaining the adjustment of BRH. I will not be able to speak to 
the agent about BRH specifically since I am not the tax preparer of BRH. 
When the IRS audits a partnership and makes an adjustment to the partnership's income or deductions, 
the IRS sends adjustment notices to the partners such as the one received late Friday in which they indicate the specific 
partner's allocable share of the partnership adjustment. The IRS notice also computes the additional tax and interest 
(there was no penalty) related to the adjustment of BRH income. 
The delta in itemized deductions is strictly due to the fact that Leon's gross income increased due to the 
audit adjustment of BRH Holdings, LP...no other reason. 
There was no disallowance of Leon's deductions claimed on his personal return. Total gross income 
affects the amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 
2% gross income limitation...so the amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions decreased due to 
increase in income. ..it's simple limitation calculation. 
3. In that context, my personal view is that tom tries to reach out by phone monday (after he and jeffrey 
touch base today or tomorrow morn to coordinate) to confirm that the 360k assessment is the show stopper. Brad, I 
agree with this approach. The 360 assessment as a result of the BRH audit in my opinion is the show stopper....if Leon 
were to sign off on 
adjustment and pay the assessment promptly, that is the end of this. 
4. On a parallel basis, I'd have jeffrey and tom edit the "alternate response letter" which, again, would 
set out our belief that the "assessment" ends this process, at least for 2012. If we don't hear back from the agent then 
we should submit in writing our understanding of the notice and assessment. I believe (and so does my partner Lisa 
Goldman) that this notice of adjustment of should "end the process". 
I can call first thing Monday and confirm (if the 
agent takes my call). We can discuss strategy first thing tomorrow.
