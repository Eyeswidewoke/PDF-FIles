The enclosed material is from the main investigative file(s), meaning the subject(s) of your request was 
the focus of the investigation. Our search located additional references, in files relating to other 
individuals, or matters, which may or may not be about your subject(s). Our experience has shown 
such additional references, if identified to the same subject of the main investigative file, usually contain 
information similar to the information processed in the main file(s). As such, we have given priority to 
processing only the main investigative file(s) given our significant backlog. If you would like to receive 
any references to the subject(s) of your request, please submit a separate request for the reference
