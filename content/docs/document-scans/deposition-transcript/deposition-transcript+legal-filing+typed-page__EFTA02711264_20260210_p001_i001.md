Man is dead. 
The choice is between the present and the past. The choice is between choice and no choice. There is no choice. 
Man is dead, and all the categories that created and characterized human existence must be reconsidered. The key to 
elimination of words? Ownership. Replace all words pertaining to ownership with words concerning functions, operations. 
What did man own? Consciousness, feelings, emotions, mind, egos spirit, soul, pain, etc., words resulting from centuries of 
belief, and no longer useful. 
Consciousness does not exist; indeed, there is no reason to believe that it ever did exist. Not conscious, not unconscious. If 
consciousness does not exist, there can hardly be a state of unconsciousness. 
Man is an abstraction. Human abstractions are based on the past, on behavior, not on operant considerations of what is 
happening. Considerations of the present? Patterns. Transaction. Activity. Doing. Considerations of the past? Behavior. 
Environment. Man. 
The abstractions of man characterize phenomena without regard to the operant activities of the phenomena. It is a limited 
system of classification. 
How to deal with what is happening? Search for rhythms and patterns. Man is dead. The analysis moves from the study of 
fixed entities that are capable of ownership to the transaction of the species with environmental forces. Look to the 
transaction. riceThe world about us is accessible only through a nervous system, and our information concerning it is confined 
to what limited information the nervous system can transmit.al The brain receives information and acts on it by telling the 
effectors what to do. The loop is completed as the performance of the effectors provides new information for the brain. It is a 
new feedback loop, a nonlinear relationship between output and input. 
Man always dealt with what had already happened, believing that it occurred in the present instant. What he thought was 
happening coincides approximately between steps two and three of the loop. ficeMan was aware only of the past, and never 
aware of the activities of his brain, where there are order and arrangement, but there is no experience of the creation of that 
order. Experience gives us no clue as to the means by which it is organized. If the organization were produced by a slide rule 
or a digital computer, consciousness would give no indication of that fact nor any basis for denying it. If the brain is capable 
of producing such organization, then it may be considered the organizer.a2
To understand these notions, it is necessary to explore the concept of the interval. The interval refers to the moment of the 
creation of the order of the brainaTMs activity. The activity of which man was never aware, the inaccessible present, the direct 
experience of the brain. iiceThe rest of time emerges only in signals relayed to us at this instant by innumerable stages and 
unexpected bearers. The nature of a signal is that its message is neither here nor now, but there and then. If it is a signal, it is 
a past action, no longer embraced by the tnowaTM of present being. The perception of a signal happens a'now,aTM but its
