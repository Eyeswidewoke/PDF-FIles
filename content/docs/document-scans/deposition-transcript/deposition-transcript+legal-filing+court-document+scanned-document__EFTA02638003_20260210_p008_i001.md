Ubisoft (Buy): Two positives at the beginning of June 
This weekend sees Ubisoft's latest title, The Crew 2, move into open beta. Our early tracking of social media 
suggests it is being well received. The original title, released in 2014, was described as an average, hollow racing game 
that didn't trouble rivals Forza or Need for Speed. We were impressed with the gameplay shown last year at E3 and felt 
the variety of experiences, challenges and types of vehicles (changing from a stunt plane to a speed boat on the fly for 
example) was a massive improvement. The beta shows a 'loot system' where items are awarded after finishing certain 
races and with them allowing customization of parts and performance (handling, power, speeds) could be attractive for 
gamers who increasingly like 'skins' in their gaming experience. The game is set in an open world environment which is a 
scaled down version of the United States. It is only in beta today — but the signs are good. 
Ubisoft has also confirmed, after a leak, that there is a new Assassin's Creed planned and will be showcased at 
E3. Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the latest title and the teased clip suggests it will be set in Ancient Greece with the 
Spartans in a vein similar to the movie 300. Our best guess right now is that the timing of the product could be for the 
first or second quarter of 2019 (annualised from the Far Cry 5 successful launch this year) which would leave the fall 
2018 release window open for Splinter Cell perhaps (more on this in the E3 review we will send out next week)? More 
will be revealed on Monday 11th June at Ubisoft's press presentation and investor day on June 12th. We will report back 
from both. 
DISH (Sell): no respite in sight 
Whether it is uncertainty over spectrum/wireless build out, OTT differentiation or structural cable cord cutting 
Dish remains exposed. Dish's Sling TV has taken three years to amass 2.3M subscribers. This week rival Hulu announced 
the company had signed up 800k subs within a year of launch which is impressive given the plan costs 2x as much as 
Sling. The basic plan costs $40 for 50 live channels versus $20 for 30 or $25 for 40 channels at Sling. 
Last week co-founder Charlie Ergen outlined plans to spend $500M-$18 on a phase one build out of wireless 
assets which focus on narrowband tech. A second phase would cost $10B but will wait for standards for 5G. So the hope 
that Dish would sell the spectrum assets for significant financial gains got another setback and the path if the company is 
now going to develop their own network, but it is both years behind rivals and probably subscale given the investments 
suggested. 
Dish's partners, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless, are waiting on the U.S. Supreme Court to decide if it will 
take on a case about FCC denials of small-business discounts. The decision is likely in June and Dish funded SNR and 
Northstar want the Supreme Court to hear the case which challenges the FCC decision that forced the companies to 
return a $3.36 small business discount and imposed a $516M penalty on the basis that Dish controls the companies and 
therefore the discounts shouldn't apply. 
Nintendo (Buy): Pokemon, and maybe Fortnite, can add to Switch momentum 
We expect more details of games from Nintendo at E3 but this week Nintendo has showcased significant 
software plans for the key franchise IP of Pokemon on Switch. Pokemon has the potential to be a big driver of Switch 
take up for two reasons: (1) these are the first RPG (role playing games) for the franchise (2) there is a massive installed 
base of Pokemon fans which could be drawn in. Some 227M unit sales on Nintendo's own platforms historically (see 
chart below) and 300M in total have been sold. And this isn't including the +800M downloads of Pokemon Go game in 
the first year of launch.

The announcement of Pokemon Quest wasn't expected and is coming on both Switch and smartphones. It will 
be a new free, non-core NPG, released today on Switch with a mobile version available from June. The RPG format of 
Pokemon: Let's Go Games will come out in November. "Let's Go, Pikachu!" and "Let's Go, Eevee!" will cost $60 and 
users will be able to transfer some of the characters they collect from playing Pokemon Go which still has 65M active 
MAUs. This will be co-op play emphasis and is aimed at a broader audience. There is also a brand new competitive play 
RPG Pokemon in development for release in H2 19.
