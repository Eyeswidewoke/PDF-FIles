Item 11 Disclosure Information 
No Information Filed 
No Information Filed 
In this Item, we ask for information about your disciplinary history and the disciplinary history of all your advisory affiliates. We use this information to 
determine whether to grant your application for registration, to decide whether to revoke your registration or to place limitations on your activities as an 
investment adviser, and to identify potential problem areas to focus on during our on-site examinations. One event may result in "yes" answers to more than 
one of the questions below. In accordance with General Instruction 5 to Form ADV, "you" and "your" include the filing adviser and all relying advisers under an 
umbrella registration. 
Your advisory affiliates are: (1) all of your current employees (other than employees performing only clerical, administrative, support or similar functions); (2) all 
of your officers, partners, or directors (or any person performing similar functions); and (3) all persons directly or indirectly controlling you or controlled by you. 
If you are a "separately identifiable department or division" (SID) of a bank, see the Glossary of Terms to determine who your advisory affiliates are. 
If you are registered or registering with the SEC or if you are an exempt reporting adviser, you may limit your disclosure of any event listed in Item 11 to ten years 
following the date of the event. If you are registered or registering with a state, you must respond to the questions as posed; you may, therefore, limit your 
disclosure to ten years following the date of an event only in responding to Items 11.A.(1), 11.A.(2), 11.8.(1), 11.8.(2), 11.D.(4), and 11.H.(1)(a). For purposes of 
calculating this ten-year period, the date of an event is the date the final order, judgment, or decree was entered, or the date any rights of appeal from preliminary 
orders, judgments, or decrees lapsed. 
You must complete the appropriate Disclosure Reporting Page ("DRP") for "yes" answers to the questions in this Item 11. 
Do any of the events below involve you or any of your supervised persons?
