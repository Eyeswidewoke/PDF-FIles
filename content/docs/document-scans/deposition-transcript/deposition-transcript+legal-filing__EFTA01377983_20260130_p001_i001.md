in connection with historical and future acquisitions if we are unable to.

successfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting, financial controls, management information, technology, human resources and other 
administrative systems, of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems: 
successfully identify and realize potential synergies among acquired and existing businesses; 
retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses; and 
successfully manage acquisition-related strain on our management, operations and financial resources and those of the various brands in our portfolio. 
Furthermore, we may not be successful in addressing other challenges encountered in connection with our acquisitions. The anticipated benefits of one or 
more of our acquisitions may not be realized or the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing 
unfavorable events or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges. The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We will incur some increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company. 
We expect that the obligations of being a public company, including public reporting and investor relations obligations, will require new expenditures, place 
new demands on our management and will require the hiring of additional personnel. Wile IAC will continue to provide us with certain corporate and shared 
services related to corporate functions for a period of time for negotiated fees, we also expect that we will need to implement additional systems and hire 
additional personnel to adequately function as a public company. We cannot precisely predict the amount and timing of these significant expenditures. See "—
Risks related to our ongoing relationship with IAC—The services that IAC will provide to us following the initial public offenng may not be sufficient to meet our 
needs, and we may have difficulty finding replacement services or be required to pay increased costs to replace these services if we no longer receive these 
services from IAC." 
We may not realize the potential benefits from our Initial public offering. 
We may not realize the benefits that vie anticipate from our initial public offering. These benefits include the following.
enabling us to allocate our capital more efficiently; 
providing us with direct access to the debt and equity capital markets, 
improving our ability to pursue acquisitions through the use of shares of our common stock as consideration: and 
enhancing our market recognition with investors. 
We may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our initial public offering for a variety of reasons. For example, the process of operating as an independent 
public company may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities. In addition, although we will have direct access to the 
debt and equity capital markets following this offering, we may not be able to issue debt or equity on terms acceptable to us or at all. The availability of 
tradable shares of our common stock for use as consideration for acquisitions also will not ensure that we win be able to successfully pursue acquisitions or 
that the acquisitions will be successful. We also may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from our
