Not Just About Us 
Every day the headlines from the Arab world get worse: An A= Qaeda affiliate group, aided by foreign fighters, battles 
with seven differ=nt homegrown Syrian rebel groups for control of the region around Aleppo, Syri=. The Iranian Embassy 
in Beirut is bombed. Mohamad Chatah, an enormously dece=t former Lebanese finance minister, is blown up after 
criticizing Hezbollah=92s brutish tactics. Another pro-Al Qaeda group takes control of Fallujah, Iraq= Explosions rock 
Egypt, where the army is now jailing Islamists and secular activists. Libya is a mess of competing militias. 
What's going on? Some say it=92s all because of the "power vacuum" — America has absented itself from the region. 
But this is not =ust about us. There's also a huge "values vacuum." The Middle East is a h=ghly pluralistic region —
Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds, Christians, Druze and variou= tribes — that for centuries was held together from above by iron-
fisted colonial powers, kings and dictators. But now that vertical control has broken down, before this pluralistic region 
has developed any true bottom-up pluralism =96 a broad ethic tolerance — that might enable its citizens to live together 
a= equal citizens, without an iron fist from above. 
For the Arab awakening to hav= any future, the ideology that is most needed now is the one being promoted least: 
Pluralism. Until that changes, argues Marwan Muasher, in his extremely relevant new book — "T=e Second Arab 
Awakening and the Battle for Pluralism" — none of the Arab uprisings will succeed. 
<= class="MsoNormal">Again, President Obama could have done more to restrai= leaders in Iraq, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, 
Iran or Syria from going to extremes. But, ultimately, argues Muasher, this is the Arabs' fight for their polit=cal future. If 
500,000 American troops in Iraq, and $1 trillion, could not impl=nt lasting pluralism in the cultural soil there, no outsider 
can, said Muasher= There also has to be a will from within. Why is it that some 15,000 Arabs a=d Muslims have flocked 
to Syria to fight and die for jihadism and zero have flocked to Syria to fight and die for pluralism? Is it only because we 
didn=92t give the "good guys" big enough guns?

As Muasher, a former Jordanian foreign=minister and now a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, 
put it in an interv=ew: 'Three years of the Arab uprising have shown the bankruptcy of all the ol= political forces in the 
Arab world." The corrupt secular autocrats who fa=led to give their young people the tools to thrive — and, as a result, 
trigge=ed these uprisings — are still locked in a struggle with Islamists, who also=have no clue how to deliver jobs, 
services, security and economic growth. (Tunis=a may be an exception.) "As long as we're in the this zero-sum game, the 
=um will be zero," says Muasher.
