These girls usually arrive with a promoter, someone hired by the club on a freelance basis to 
bring in a certain group of people. Indeed, nearly every job at a club is about bringing people in. 
There are hipster promoters who only bring in hipsters and model promoters who only bring in 
models, and some promoters daylight as male models. There are mosquitoes, rats, gnats, 
leeches, agents, and then you have promoters, says Steve Lewis. A promoter is a glorified pimp. 
But then, everyone's a pimp. Some promoters don't even refer to models as models. Lewis will 
often get texts that say, I'll be rolling deep with about a dozen hookers. 
Next in line are the cocktail waitressesin the nightclub glossary, they are also called bottle waitresses, 
bottle girlscarrying Grey Goose and Cristal high above their heads. If you buy two or more 
bottles at once, they will sometimes deliver them with sparklers. So if you're paying $2,400 for 
two $30 bottles of vodka, now the whole room will know. The models or near models will see 
the fireworks and float over, moths to green light. The bottle girls are so tired. You can tell 
when the sparklers light up their faces. Bottle waitresses don't get excited for two bottles and a 
sparkler. Try ten bottles and a black AmEx. 
Rachel Uchitel wants to make it very clear that she is not, nor was she ever, a bottle girl. I don't even 
know how to open a bottle. These women are commodities, the type of girl who, in Uchitel's 
opinion, might just as easily have wound up working in a strip club. They know what they're 
getting into, she says. They tell you up front, that they're staffing model positions, like the 
shirtless guys outside of Abercrombie. And there are contracts about appearance. No matter 
how beautiful, the bottle girls are told that there are thousands of girls waiting to replace them. 
They see them on the street. They see them in their clubs. 
Next: You're a bottle waitress, and that means you're half a stripper and half a pimp. 
Kim is a 26-year-old brunette and a veteran of the bottle service. She's served at a lot of Manhattan 
clubs, working her way up from third-tier places to the most exclusive ones. Kim is not her real 
name because she's worried. Everybody knows bottle girls by first name and hair color. In a 
Nolita coffee shop by daylight, she's got a gothic pallor to her. You can tell she's the kind of girl 
who at night looks totally different. 
You're a bottle waitress, and that means you're half a stripper and half a pimp, she says. If you don't 
book a client, you're fired. Most places I worked, I had to sign a confidentiality agreement 
about celebrities. I have a friend who sold pictures of a celebrity. If anyone found out, she'd 
never work in this town again. Forget that. She'd never go out in this town again. 
Bottle girls, like VIP hosts, are expected to have client lists. Early in the evening, she will text her clients. 
I'm working tonight and my favorite D.J. is spinning. Come by! They come because she is pretty 
and she has flirted with them. Hey, baby. Hey, handsome. You lost weight. Sugar honey sexy 
baby handsome. They come because she's someone whose backside they can palm, someone 
who will kiss them at 3 a.m. between tables. 
One night, Kim had two clients come in. The owner of a major sports franchise and a Middle Eastern 
royal. I couldn't entertain them both myself, so I went and grabbed two modelsshe makes a 
motion with both her hands as though she is plucking up two cats by the napes of their 
necksand I dropped them at the tables. 
At the tables, the bottle girls will up-sell their clients. They push Champagne because it goes faster than 
vodka, and they steer them away from the Veuve/Moet and toward the Krug/Cristal. Kim was 
making between $1,000 and $3,000 a night in tips. 
And that, she says, doesn't include what's going on behind the scenes. She smiles, and it is not
