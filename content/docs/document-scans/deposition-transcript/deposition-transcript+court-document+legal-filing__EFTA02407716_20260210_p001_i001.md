Isabel as we all know has a rapier wit. One time she asked to accompany her to a garage in the Brompton Rd. 
as she was interested in buying a new Mini drop head coupe. She asked me if I would kindly cal the showroom 
and make arrangements for her to inspect a car. I duly called the owner of the garage and told him I was 
bringing Sir James Goldsmith's daughter round later that aftemoon and that she would very much like to see a 
Mini drop head. As you can well image he was eager to oblige and told me that he would attend to Isabel 
himself. 
We arrived at 3:00pm to be greeted by the unctuous owner of the garage, who immediately offered Isabel a cup 
of tea. "No thank you" she replied "Just show me a Mini cabriolet". Again the owner attempted to offer her 
hospitality and once more invited her to his office to talk about specifications etc. "No" she said " I just want to 
see a car. At his third attempt to coerce her to his desk, Isabel turned to his secretary and asked with a dead 
pan voice "Is he in training??" Shocked owner of garage jaw just drops open

A couple of my favourites are as follows; 
Isabel calls me to say she is having trouble with her Portuguese domestics and as I "have a way with 
staff" would I mind dropping in to see them, which I do a couple of days later. 
I forget their names, but lets call them Jose and Paulina. I ask Jose what the matter is. He replies 
and I quote as near verbatim as i can recall; 
"Sir, its not that I mind Miss Isabel screaming at me, its not that I mind Miss Isabel screaming at me 
in front of my wife, its not that I mind Mrs Isabel slapping me. its not that I mind her slapping me in 
from of my wife, its just that I cannot accept being slapped in the street" !I! 
Another good one was when I took Isabel to Bali, Indonesia 15 yrs ago. Whilst there she did a lot of 
shopping of local artifacts and hand crafts, including ordering a large bolt of fabric specially woven to 
her instructions. She asked Ugo Gerasati, the Brazilian socialite who had a fabricshop out there at 
the time specialising in Balinese batiquesetc, how he proposed sending this to her once completed, 
as she had no intention whatsoever of being paying outrageous postage and packing charges. He 
told her that he had an excellent solution, which would involve no costs at all. He would ask the next 
English customer who happened to be in the shop when the fabric was ready, if they would mind 
taking it with them back to London. Quite a favour to ask of anyone especially when this bolt was the 
size of a large packing case. 
In any event the late Mary Howard (Lord Patrick Howard's charming wife) dropped by a few weeks 
later to visit Ugo and was tasked with taking this huge package to London which she readily agreed 
to do. 
On arrival in London, the first thing she did was to call Isabel whom she had never met. She did this 
promptly at 9:00Am in the morning, not a good time for Isabel who is a night owl and generally only 
goes to sleep around 6 and then wakes around lunchtime. The result of this call, which of course 
woke Isabel, was for her to scream at Mary "Do you know what time this is? Do you think this is an 
office?" To which Mary replied, somewhat startled at the hostility of this reaction, " I was calling to let 
you know I have brought your fabric back from Bali". Isabel, not remotely mollified, cursed her for
