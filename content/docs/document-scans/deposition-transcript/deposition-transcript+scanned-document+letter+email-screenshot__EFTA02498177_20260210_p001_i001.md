Subject: 
help/ideas for my work with at-risk kids 
Dear Jeffrey, 
I am writing to seek yo=r help and advice on the work that lam doing with at-risk children — a he=erogeneous 
population ranging in age from 4-21, and with a mix of clinical and developmental challenges. As you know, for the past 
few years I have been working with a growing number of programs that function to make the m=ntal and physical 
health of at-risk children better. What started out in 2013 as work with one school and about 80 children, has grown to 
a few thou=and kids, dozens of schools, and not only in Massachusetts, but other parts of =he US and even abroad 
(Costa Rica). Interest in both my software and consultin= is growing strongly. The reason for the success is, I believe, 
twofold. =irst, the software we have built has radically reduced the time programs invest in data entry, while providing 
t=em with more sophisticated and useful analyses, Secondly, the interventions we have developed, based on the mind 
and brain sciences, have led to significa=t gains in time on learning, while also reducing highly disruptive behaviors, 
including violence. 
Here's the iron= of this entire story. Despite the fact that these children often place the largest financial burden on 
public school district=, communities, and our country, the amount of investment into these programs =s extremely low. 
When you look at the billions of dollars going into education, very little of it is focused on special education. This is not 
only sad, but economically and socially backwards. Take one simple example. Consider adolescents with criminal 
records. A 2007 study showed that those adolescent criminals who were among the most impulsive (lowest self-
control=, were five times more likely to end up as career criminals. A career c=iminal costs society about $1.5 million. 
Since the sciences have uncovered a great deal about individual differences in self-control and the capacity to 
strengthen it, programs foc=sed on this capacity, early in life, are likely to make substantial contributio=s to not only 
individual welfare, but the economics of our country. 
When I approach schools=to take advantage of our software and our approach to strengthening capacities to l=arn and 
make good decisions, including self-control, their budgets limit what i= possible. In brief, the interest and desire to 
collaborate is strong, but f=nancial limitations minimize what is possible. 
What I am looking for a=e ways to find funds to offset costs to these programs, effectively providing them wi=h the 
software and consulting at no cost so that we can do something at a lar=e scale and show the power of this approach. 
We have the evidence: in schools where we have worked, our interventions have led to 50% increases in time o= 
learning, lowered levels of violence, improved self-control, and dramatic increases in the sophistication of evidence-
based methods. My strong belief=is that if I can get these programs off the ground by providing them with the software 
and techniques for improving learning and decision-making, that th= approach will rapidly grow. There is considerable 
interest among the public, alternative education programs with=n Massachusetts, known as Collaboratives. I am 
working with 25% of the Collaboratives, and all know about our work. I am confident that we could put in place the 
software and methods across these programs, and create a model=for how to help children in special education.
