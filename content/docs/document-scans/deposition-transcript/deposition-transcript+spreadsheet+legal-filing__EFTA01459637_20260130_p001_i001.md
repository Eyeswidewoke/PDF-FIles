US Equity Insights 
Sharp correction at Financials led by Bear market at Banks 
Banks are down -25% from their highs in mid 2015, about twice the 13% S&P 500 sell-
off. While many investors are scarred by the financial crisis, it's not normal for banks to 
suffer nearly twice the S&P's decline in corrections. Unless Banks are at the epicenter 
of trouble (late 1980s, 1994, 1998, and since 2007), their beta is usually only slightly 
above 1 and not near 2 as recently seen. Inside, we present the performance of Banks 
around prior market corrections. We realize that Bank indices have more market 
exposure than history and banks revenue continue to be challenged by persistently low 
LT yields and less income earnings assets under stricter regulations, but we see S&P 
Banks at 9x our 2016E EPS as too cheap and still like their payout upside.
