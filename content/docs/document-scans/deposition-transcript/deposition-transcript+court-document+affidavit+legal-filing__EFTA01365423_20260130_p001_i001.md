(f) 
A payment on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly 
provided for, on any Distribution Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security 
(or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the related 
Record Date. Payments of principal to Holders of the Notes of each Class shall be made in the 
proportion that the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Notes of such Class registered in the 
name of each such Holder on such Record Date bears to the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of 
all Notes of such Class on such Record Date. Payment of Defaulted Interest (and in the case of 
the Class A Notes, interest thereon) may be made in any other lawful manner in accordance with 
the Priority of Payments if notice of such payment is given by the Trustee to the Issuer and the 
Holders and such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. 
(g) 
All reductions in the principal amount of a Security (or one or more predecessor 
Securities) effected by payments made on any Distribution Date shall be binding upon all future 
Holders of such Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in 
exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, whether or not such payment is noted on such Security.

Applicable Issuer under the Securities and the obligations of each of the Co-Issuers under this 
Indenture are limited recourse obligations of each of such Co-Issuers payable solely from the 
Collateral in accordance with the Priority of Payments. Following realization of the Collateral 
and distribution of proceeds in the manner provided in the Priority of Payments, any obligations 
of the Co-Issuers and any claims of the Trustee, the Holders, any other Secured Parties and any 
third-party beneficiaries of this Indenture against the Co-Issuers shall be extinguished and shall 
not thereafter revive. No recourse shall be had for the payment of any amount owing in respect 
of the Securities or this Indenture against any Transaction Party (other than the Applicable 
Issuer) or any of the Officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents, partners, members, 
incorporators, Affiliates, successors or assigns of a Transaction Party or of the Co-Issuers for any 
amounts payable under the Securities or this Indenture. It is understood that the foregoing 
provisions of this paragraph (h) shall not (i) prevent recourse to the Collateral in the manner 
provided herein for the sums due or to become due under any obligation, instrument or 
agreement that is part of the Collateral or (ii) constitute a waiver, release or discharge of any 
indebtedness or obligation evidenced by the Securities (to the extent that they evidence debt) or 
secured by this Indenture until such Collateral has been realized and proceeds distributed in 
accordance with the Priority of Payments, whereupon any outstanding indebtedness or obligation 
shall be extinguished. It is further understood that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (h) 
shall not limit the right of any Person to name the Issuer or the Co-Issuer as a party defendant in 
any proceeding or in the exercise of any other remedy under the Securities or this Indenture, so
