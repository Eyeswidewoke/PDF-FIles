Accordi=g to Juan Zarate, who helped implement financial sanctions while serving in=George W. Bush's 
Treasury department, "Once the [other curr=ncyj becomes an alternative to the dollar, rules of the game begin to 
chang=." 
Leong Sing Chiong, As=istant Managing Director at a major central bank, said this dollar alternat=ve "is 
likely to transform the financial landscape in the next 5-10=years." 
Currency expert D=. Steve Sjuggerud warned, "I've been active in the markets f=r over two decades 
now, but I've never seen anything that could mov= so much money, so quickly. The announcement will start a domino 
effe=t, that will basically determine who in America gets rich in the years to c=me, and 
who strugg=es. 
Dr. Sjuggerud says if you ow= any US "paper' assets - and that includes stocks, bonds, o= just cash in a 
bank account — you should be aware of what'= 
about to happen a=d know how to prepare. A number of experts believe a recent spike in g=ld and 
silver prices is a direct result of the IMF's action. P=ecious metals notoriously rise when the US dollar falls. 
The Death of the US Dollar in One Frightening Graph=/div> 
For the last 600 years, there have=been six different global reserve currencies controlled by world 
superpower=. The latest — the US dollar — has dominated world currency=for over 80 years. The alarming fact is, global 
reserve currencies have collapsed every 80-90 y=ars for the last six centuries! What does this mean for 
America and the dom=nance of the US dollar? Based on recent evidence and long-standing historic.' trends, 
experts p=edict the imminent collapse of the US dollar! What's more alarming?=Many Americans aren't 
yet doing the one thing that will save their s=vings & retirement from US dollar collapse. 
Just take a look at the graph below. It shows the lifespan o= dominant currencies going back 600 years. 
Notice that the US dollar has no= been the dominant currency for 88 years, about the same length of time as i=s 
predecessors. 
It's obv=ous why experts say that the US dollar's days as the world'= reserve currency are coming to a 
climactic end. 
All Fiat Currencies Collapse 
"Fiat" currency is paper currency backed by not=ing tangible. As opposed to "sound money" which is 
backed b= gold or some other valuable commodity, a fiat currency is backed by nothin= more than faith in the 
government. The US dollar has been a fiat currency s=nce Nixon closed the gold window in 
1971 in what was the greatest heist in American history. T=e scary fact is, the average life span of a fiat 
currency is 40 years, and t=e US dollar 
has no= exceeded 40 years as a fiat currency! 
Prior to 1933 and for well over 100 years, the dollar was backed by g=Id, and $20 bought you an ounce 
of gold. But after the government stole all=US citizens' gold in 1933 for a $20 paper certificate, gold was rev=lued at 
US$35, meaning the dollar was devalued by 43% overnight and all for=ign and domestic holders of dollars were 
effectively robbed. 
After Nixon closed the gold window completely in=1971, it took $67 to buy an ounce of gold, devaluing 
the US dollar by 50% a=ain. Today, it takes well 
over a thousand US dollars to buy that same ounce of gold. Why? Beca=se 
the US dollar i= now nothing more than a fast-declining Federal Reserve note backed by a co=rupt 
government that is saddled with $18 trillion in
