"He said, 'I'd like to bring you,"' Mr. Dershowitz said. 
By any measure, Mr. Dershowitz had led an interesting life. At 28, after 
clerking for a Supreme Court justice, Mr. Dershowitz became 
the youngest professor ever hired by Harvard Law School. It was outside the 
classroom, however, where his fame grew. He handled 
celebrated cases, appeared as television commentator and wrote many books, 
fiction and nonfiction. His account of the von Bulow 
case, "Reversal of Fortune," was made into a film in 1990 in which the 
actor Ron Silver donned a bushy mustache and aviator glasses 
to play Mr. Dershowitz. 
Along with enjoying celebrity, Mr. Dershowitz has also relished excoriating 
those he considers foes. He has taken on journalists, 
chided universities for coddling students and has been relentless in his 
defense of Israel, for example, accusing the writer Alice Walker 
of bigotry for refusing to allow an Israeli publisher to translate her novel 
"The Color Purple." 
Soon after meeting Mr. Epstein, Mr. Dershowitz became drawn into his 
rarefied world. Mr. Epstein was an enigmatic figure living in an 
Upper East Side mansion once owned by Mr. Wexner, who had reportedly been 
his mentor. A college dropout who once worked for 
Bear Stearns, Mr. Epstein said he handled investments for billionaires, 
though other than Mr. Wexner, he declined to identify them. 
Along with prominent businessmen, Mr. Epstein's friends included scientists, 
socialites and celebrities. He donated $30 million to 
finance scientific research at Harvard. President Bill Clinton and the actor 
Kevin Spacey flew aboard his private jet to Africa to discuss 
AIDS policy. 
Mr. Dershowitz also traveled on Mr. Epstein's plane and was invited to join 
his chats with Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime 
minister. The men grew so close that Mr. Dershowitz solicited Mr. Epstein's 
feedback as he was writing books. 
In the interview in his Manhattan apartment, Mr. Dershowitz said Mr. Epstein 
was often surrounded by young women, but none struck 
him as underage. "I never got involved in his social life," he said. 
However, in late 2005, around the time when Mr. Dershowitz and his family 
were vacationing at Mr. Epstein's home, Palm Beach 
detectives were sifting through the trash outside. Acting on a tip, the 
authorities were investigating whether women working as 
assistants to Mr. Epstein were finding teenage girls to give him sexual 
massages. As the inquiry unfolded, detectives spoke with girls, 
some of whom were 15 or younger. 
After taking the case, Mr. Dershowitz responded, as was his way, with 
hardball tactics. He gathered information from the girls' postings 
on social media accounts, which he claimed showed they were drug users or 
had lied to Mr. Epstein about their age. He also helped 
put together a defense team that included Roy Black, the prominent trial 
lawyer, and Kenneth W. Starr, who led the investigation into 
President Bill Clinton's involvement with Monica Lewinsky. 
A local prosecutor, after meetings with Mr. Epstein's defense team, 
recommended that he be charged only with a misdemeanor.
