Washington's Kid Gloves and Egypt's Fist

November 8, 2013 --=Remember that moving passage in Barack Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo in whi=h the president 
said</=pan>, "in order to move forwa=d, we must say openly the things we hold in our hearts, and that too often=are 
said only behind closed doors"? I couldn't help thinking of that as I read Secretary of State John Kerry's agonizingl= 
circumscribed remarks during his own visit to Cairo earlier this week, wh=re he insist=d that the administration w=s 
pleased with Egypt's progress towards the restoration of democracy, and =bus that the decision to temporarily suspend 
the transfer of weapons -- jet fighters, tanks, helicopters and mi=siles -- was not meant as a "punishment." Kerry's trip 
has not, =n general, been long on candor. The secretary was probably not saying what=was in his heart when he 
traveled to Saudi Arabia and answered a question about whether Saudi women should have=the right to drive by 
awkwar=ly observing that "it'= up to Saudi Arabia to make its own decisions about its own social structu=e choices and 
timing for whatever events." But Saudi Arabia is an implacably authoritarian ally, and diplomacy betwee= Washington 
and Riyadh has always been governed by polite evasion. Indeed,=Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal returned the 
favor by denying that r=lations between the two states were "dramatically deteriorating." What is new is that the Unite= 
States now feels compelled to treat Egypt with the kid gloves usually res=rved for the Saudis. The inference I draw from 
Kerry's delicate toe-dancin= is not so much that President Obama has given up on democracy promotion in the Middle 
East, as is often alleged</=pan>, as that Egypt has changed in such a=way that Washington gains almost nothing by 
speaking the truth. In 2005, when a previous secretary of state, Condol=ezza Rice, came to Egypt, she shocked the ruling 
elite by declar=ng that "the day must =ome when the rule of law replaces emergency degrees." But Rice had 
an=audience: the activists who had taken to the streets to protest the autocratic rule of President Hosni Mubarak. And 
those activ=sts were delighted and emboldened, at least until 2007, when Mubarak sent =is thugs into the street to 
block parliamentary elections, and the White H=use of President George W. Bush said nothing. What audience would 
Kerry have been addressing if he had spo=en what one imagines -- what one at least would like to imagine -- was in =is 
heart? Those same liberal activists, having overthrown the dictator who= Rice and Bush had admonished, have 
collaborated with the military to depose the democratically elected l=aders who replaced Mubarak. Such was the 
liberals' hatred of the Muslim Br=therhood government that they have accepted, at least for now, what looks =ery much 
like an autocratic restoration. It's shocking that Kerry said nothing in Cairo about the trial of former p=esident Mohamed 
Morsy on trumped-up charges of incitement to murder, sched=led to begin the day after Kerry left. But if he had, he 
would have infurirted both the new regime and its liberal supporters. In his remarks, Kerry said as often as he could that 
E=ypt's transition to democracy must be "inclusive," which was cod= for "include Islamists." But it will be no such thing. 
Two days=after Morsy went on trial, a high court in Cairo upheld a decision to ban the Brotherhood -- in a case originally 
brought by a lib=ral secular party. Bahaa el-Din, the one senior member of the interim gove=nment who has had the 
temeri=y to call for "reconci=iation" with the Brotherhood, has been shouted down, and now claims t= have been 
misunderstood. Nor, in all likelihood, will that democracy be very democratic, since the military rulers who seiz=d 
control in the July 3 coup have virtually eliminated press freedom -- th= English-language Egyptian press which I read 
carries only the most barely=factual accounts of controversial issues -- and are planning to promulgate a law which gives 
the Interior Ministry the right to approve of dem=nstrations in advance, and to cancel or relocate them. 
To assert, as Kerry=did, that "we need to keep faith with the roadmap and the path ahead =o continue the march to 
democracy" is thus an absurdity. The path Egy=t is on is one of military rule with a civilian facade -- Pakistan, circa 2007 -
- while embittered supporters of the Mus=im Brotherhood seethe. That is a formula for instability, if not chaos. Ke=ry 
tried to change the subject by focusing on Egypt's crucial "econom=c choices," but the country's leaders won't have to 
make those choices -- so long as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and t=e UAE are prepared to funnel billions of dollars into the 
treasury. It see=s incredible to say so, but right now Egypt looks less likely than either =emen or Libya to make a 
transition towards a more liberal and democratic form of government than it had befor=. Contending groups in both of 
those countries, and in Tunisia as well, ha=e begun a process of reconciliation, or at least begun to talk about it. 1= Egypt,
