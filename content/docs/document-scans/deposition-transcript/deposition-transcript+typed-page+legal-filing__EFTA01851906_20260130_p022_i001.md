Fund Terms and Conditions 
two consecutive years and the fund advisor(s) cannot be 
contacted. The community foundation's staff will attempt to 
contact the fund advisor(s) at least three times via certified 
mail and allow 30 days for a response. If contact cannot 
be made, the community foundation's board of directors 
will advise an annual payout to support the community 
grantmaking program in accordance with the community 
foundation's spending policies. If two more years pass with 
no contact from the advisor, the fund in its entirety will be 
transferred to the Community Endowment Fund. A fund must 
have inactivity for a total of four years before being transferred 
to the Community Endowment Fund. 
Fund Closure 
A fund advisor may recommend closing a fund by granting 
up to 100% of the fund balance to a qualified charitable 
organization, including any of the community foundation's 
funds (e.g., field of interest funds, endowment funds, 
operating funds). Such recommendations must be received 
in writing and, if approved, funds will be disbursed in 
accordance with the community foundation's current 
grantmaking policies and applicable laws and regulations. 
Closing a fund by recommending a grant to another qualified 
charitable organization which is approved will occur as 
follows: 80% of the current balance will be granted within 
10 business days of the request date, barring any issues 
with the organization's status as a qualified public charity or 
equivalent. The remaining balance of the fund, including any 
residual net earnings, will be granted within the following 45 
days. Endowed funds are permanent and cannot be closed. 
Conflict of Terms 
In the event of an inconsistency between these terms 
and conditions and any terms and conditions appearing 
elsewhere in connection with any fund, these terms and 
conditions, as interpreted by the community foundation, 
shall govern, and the community foundation reserves the 
right to take any actions at any time which, in its discretion, 
it deems reasonably necessary or desirable for the proper 
administration of any fund at the community foundation or to 
comply with applicable law. 
Frequently Asked Questions 
What is a donor advised fund? 
A donor advised fund is not a separate legal entity like a 
trust or a corporation. It is a fund defined by the IRS that a 
sponsoring charity, like Silicon Valley Community Foundation, 
creates through a written agreement with a donor. The donor 
contributes assets to the community foundation which agrees 
to treat those assets as a separate fund on its books, while 
the donor retains the privilege of recommending charitable 
grants from the fund and how the community foundation 
should invest the fund's assets. 
Who owns the assets once the gift is made and the fund 
is opened? 
The law requires the community foundation to make 
clear in the agreement, and to obtain the donor's written 
acknowledgement, that the assets in a donor advised fund 
are the property of the community foundation and that the 
community foundation has discretion and control over the use 
and investment of the donor advised fund's assets. 
Why is discretion and control an issue? 
In order for a donor to take advantage of the tax benefits that 
flow from a charitable gift, the gift has to be complete—that 
is, the donor has to part with control over the donated assets. 
The appearance of donor control could put the donor's tax 
deduction in jeopardy. Therefore, fund advisors cannot make 
pledges on behalf of the fund and can only make non-binding 
recommendations about grants; they cannot control when and 
how the community foundation will make grants nor control 
decisions about which grantees will receive funding. 
What are the limits on donor benefits in connection with 
donor advised fund grants? 
Donors, fund advisors and related parties (such as family 
members or business interests) may receive only "incidental' 
benefits from a grant or investment of a donor advised fund. 
If a donor, fund advisor or related party receives more than an 
incidental benefit in connection with a donor advised grant, 
the IRS will assess a penalty of 125% of the amount of the 
improper benefit. The penalty may be assessed against either 
the person who recommended the grant or the person who 
received the benefit. (There is a separate penalty if a donor, 
fund advisor or related party receives a direct distribution from 
the donor advised fund, such compensation or an expense 
reimbursement.) 
Please contact the community foundation at donate@siliconvalleycf.org or 650.450.5444 if you have questions 
about these terms and conditions.
