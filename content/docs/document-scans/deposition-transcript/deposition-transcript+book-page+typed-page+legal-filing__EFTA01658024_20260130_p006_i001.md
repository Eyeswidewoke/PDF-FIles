Trump Demands Death Penalty For Tsarnaev. The New York Post (8/2, Sheehy, 
4.57M) reports that in a tweet Sunday afternoon, President Trump "demanded the death 
penalty for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - whose execution was taken off the 
table by an appellate court last week." Trump wrote, "Rarely has anybody deserved the death 
penalty more than the Boston Bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The court agreed that this "was one 
of the worst domestic terrorist attacks since the 9/11 atrocities". Yet the appellate court tossed 
out the death sentence. So many lives lost and ruined. The Federal Government must again 
seek the Death Penalty in a do-over of that chapter of the original trial. Our Country cannot let 
the appellate decision stand. Also, it is ridiculous that this process is taking so long!" 
Reuters (8/2, Schroeder) reports, "In a tweet, Trump said the federal government must 
challenge a Friday appeals court decision overturning the death penalty for the 2013 attack. 
`Rarely has anybody deserved the death penalty more than the Boston Bomber, Dzhokhar 
Tsarnaev,' tweeted Trump. `The Federal Government must again seek the Death Penalty in a do-
over of that chapter of the original trial." 
PROTESTS 
Portland Protests Calmer After Federal Agents Stand Down. 
The Washington Post (8/2, Taylor, Rosenberg, 14.2M) reports that after "66 straight nights," the 
protests in downtown Portland "may be reaching a turning point: The weekend brought none of 
the large-scale tear gas and firework-fueled clashes that marked the previous two months of 
unrest, a potential sign of calming tensions after the Trump administration pulled back federal 
law enforcement officers." However, it is "not clear what direction the protests in the city, which 
show no sign of stopping, will take next." 
In a similar report headlined "With No Federal Agents On Streets, Portland Protests Turn 
Largely Peaceful," the Wall Street Journal (8/2, Caldwell, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says 
that since Thursday, the first night without a visible federal law enforcement presence, protests 
have been mostly peaceful. The New York Times (8/2, Baker, 18.61M) too reports that on 
Saturday night, "the crowd saw a third consecutive night of calm since the start of a plan to 
withdraw federal agents who had brought a militarized crackdown to the city." 
The AP (7/31, Flaccus) reports that in Portland, there has been a "dramatic change in tone 
outside a federal courthouse that's become ground zero in clashes between demonstrators and 
federal agents...after the U.S. government began drawing down its forces under a deal between 
Democratic Gov. Kate Brown and the Trump administration." According to the AP, "As agents 
from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement pulled back, troopers with the Oregon State Police were supposed to take 
over." The AP says "there were no signs of any law enforcement presence outside the Mark O. 
Hatfield Federal Courthouse, however, where a protest lasted into early Friday." 
The Washington Post (7/31, Taylor, 14.2M) also reports that "as the Black Lives Matter-
inspired vigil wound down early Friday morning, there was virtually no sign of the Oregon State 
Police officers who had taken over protection of the federal buildings at the center of the 
protests." According to the Post, "Instead of being forcibly removed from downtown's Lownsdale 
Square and the adjacent Chapman Square...the crowd thinned out on its own, with many 
protesters heading home of their own accord." The Post says that "by a little after 1 a.m., only a 
relatively small crew remained, far down from the enormous crowd that had gathered four 
hours earlier to listen to speakers and chant anti-law enforcement slogans." 
Reuters (7/31, Bloom) reports that Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell "tweeted his thanks 
to protesters who stopped attempts to light fires and throw projectiles on the 63rd night of 
demonstrations, when there were no arrests." While Reuters adds that acting Homeland 
Security Secretary Wolf indicated Friday morning that DHS agents "remained on standby and 
National Guard troops could be sent in should state police be overrun," the Wall Street Journal
