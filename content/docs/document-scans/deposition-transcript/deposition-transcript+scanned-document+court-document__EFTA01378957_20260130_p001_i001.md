4. Client's Margin Loan Is a Demand Loan. As such, DBSI or Pershing has the right to demand at any time the immediate 
payment of all or any portion of a margin balance. 
5. Liens. Client hereby grants to DBSI and its Affiliates a security interest in and lien upon all Securities and Other Property in 
the possession or control of DBSI, any of its Affiliates or Pershing, in which Client has an interest (held Individually, jointly or 
otherwise) (collectively all such Securities and Other Property are referred to herein as "DB Collateral") in order to secure any 
and all indebtedness or any other obligation of Client to DBSI and its Affiliates or Pershing (collectively, all such obligations 
are referred to herein as the "DB Obligations"). Client further grants to Pershing a security interest in and lien (the "Pershing 
lien") upon all Securities and Other Property held in Client's Margin Arrrnint(s) and any associated cash account(s) ("Margin 
Collateral") to secure the indebtedness or any other obligation of Client to Pershing in this Margin Account (the "Margin 
Obligations"). Clients who are joint account holders (Joint Accountholders) acknowledge and agree that DB Collateral shall 
include Securities and Other Property held in the Account or any other account held by either Joint Accountholder with 
DBSI or its Affiliates (whether individually, jointly or otherwise) and shall secure any and all DB Obligations of each Joint 
Accountholder to DBSI and its Affiliates. With respect to the lien granted to DBSI and its Affiliates, DBSI (or Pershing, at 
DBSI's instruction) may, at any time and without prior notice, sell, transfer, release, exchange, settle or otherwisedispose 
of or deal with any or all such DB Collateral in order to satisfy any DB Obligations. In enforcing this lien, DBSI shall have the 
discretion to determine which Securities and Other Property to apply for the purposes of the foregoing. With respect to 
the Pershing Lien, Pershing may, at anytime and without prior notice, sell, transfer, release, exchange, settle or otherwise 
dispose of or deal with any or all Margin Collateral in order to satisfy any Margin Obligations. In enforcing this Pershing 
lien, Pershing shall have the discretion to determine what and how much Margin Collateral to applyfor the purposes of the 
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be deemed to grant an interest in any Account or assets that 
would give rise to a prohibited transaction under Section 4975(cX1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 
or Section 406(a)(i)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Securities and Other Property 
held in Client's retirement account(s) maintained by DBSI, which may include IRAs or qualified plans, are not subject to this 
lien and such Securities and Other Property may only be used to satisfy Client's indebtedness or other obligations related to 
Client's retirement account(s). 
6. Consent to Loan or Pledge of Securities and Other Property. Within the limitations imposed by Applicable Law, all 
Securities and Other Property now or hereafter held, carried or maintained by or in the possession of ()BSI that have 
not been fully paid for, or are held in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan, may be lent to DBSI, to Pershing 
or to others, and may be pledged, repledged, hypothecated or rehypothecated by DBSI and/or Pershing without notice 
to Client either separately or in common with other securities, commodities and other property of DBSI's or Pershing's 
other clients for any amount due in any account with DB51 in which Client has an interest, or for any greater amount, 
and OBSI and/or Pershing may do so without retaining in its possession or control for delivery a like amount of similar 
Securities and Other Property. Client understands that while securities held for Client's Account(s) are loaned out, Client 
will lose voting rights attendant to such securities. Margin securities in Client's account may be used for, amcng other 
things, settling short sales and lending the securities for short sales. Asa result, Pershing and/or DBSI may receive 
compensation in connection with these transactions. Neither Pershing, nor OBSI, will lend or pledge fully paid for 
securities without Client's written permission. 
7. Margin Maintenance, Calls for Additional Collateral, Liquidations and Covering Short Positions. In order to engage in 
margin transactions, Client will be required to maintain such Securities and Other Property in Client's Margin Account(s) 
for margin purposes as shall be required under Applicable Law or otherwise by OBSI or Pershing for any reason. Client 
may be required to post, deposit or maintain additional collateral at any time. In making these determinations, Pershing 
and DBSI may take Into account various factors including, but not limited to (I) issues as to Client's securities such as, 
among others, the liquidity of a position and concentrations of securities in an Account (ii) considerations as to Clients 
status, including but not limited to a decline in creditworthiness, (iii) the size of the Account, (iv) the general condition 
of the market, (v) considerations as to the ability of Pershing to obtain financing, end (vi) regulatory interpretations or 
guidance. In addition to the rights otherwise set forth In this Agreement, DBSI and Pershing also shall have the right to 
liquidate any Securities and Other Property held in the Margin Account whenever 06S1 or Pershing deems it necessary 
for its protection. Circumstances that may result in collateral calls or liquidations include, but are not limited to, the failure 
to promptly meet any call for additional collateral, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, the appointment of a receiver by 
or against Client, or the attachment or levy against any account with DBSI in which Client has an interest.
