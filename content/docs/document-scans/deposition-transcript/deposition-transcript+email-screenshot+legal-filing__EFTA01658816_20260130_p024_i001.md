Giuliani said on Fox News' Hannity (11/19, 535K), "It was a national conspiracy. More 
than just three states, it was 10 states. It's impossible that in Pittsburgh, and in Philadelphia, 
and Detroit, and in Milwaukee, and in Phoenix, the Democratic leaders woke up on November 3 
and said, 'We are going to shut all the Republicans out. We are going to put them in shoots. We 
are not going to let them see absentee ballots,' when for 100 years, we all look at absentee 
ballots. This had to come from someplace in the Biden campaign." USA Today (11/19, Shannon, 
10.31M), Politico (11/19, Forgey, Isenstadt, 4.29M), Breitbart (11/19, 673K), and the Fox News 
(11/19, Blitzer, 27.59M) website also cover the news conference. 
Cornyn Says Biden Not Yet President-Elect, But Says He Has Seen No Evidence Of 
Fraud. The Dallas Morning News (11/19, Gillman, 946K) reports Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) 
"said Thursday that he does not consider Joe Biden to be the president-elect, arguing that it is 
premature to apply that title until votes are certified and legal challenges are resolved. But 
Cornyn acknowledges that he is unaware of any evidence backing up [Trump's] contention that 
the election has been stolen through fraud or ballot tampering." Cornyn said, "He is not 
president-elect until the votes are certified. So the answer to that is no. And I don't know what 
basis you or anybody else would claim that he's president-elect before the votes are certified 
and these contests are resolved." 
Boston Globe's Pindell Says Trump Could Decide To Resign. James Pindell of the 
Boston Globe (11/19, 972K) writes, "The most logical ending to the Trump presidency isn't him 
hunkering down inside of the West Wing forcing a constitutional crisis. The most logical thing is 
that he just quits, possibly even a few days before Biden is sworn in. ... By quitting, he could 
make a deal with [Vice President] Pence: you get to be the 46th president for a small stretch 
and, in return, you pardon me. ... The thing about quitting is that he leaves entirely on his own 
terms. ... Sticking around or trying to use the levers of power to stay in office would be 
dramatic but is a lot less predictable. Quitting is a script he would get to write." And Trump 
"isn't acting like he is enjoying the job of president much anymore." 
CDC Urges Americans Not To Travel Over Thanksgiving. 
David Muir opened ABC World News TonightVi (11/19, lead story, 3:30, Muir, 7.26M) by 
reporting on a "blunt" new warning from the CDC "urging Americans not to travel this 
Thanksgiving. With the nation having lost more than 250,000 American lives to this and given 
what they've seen in just the last 24 hours, nearly 200,000 new cases, the numbers are simply 
accelerating too fast." Norah O'Donnell said on the CBS Evening NewsVi (11/19, lead story, 
3:40, O'Donnell, 4.28M), "In a blunt and ominous warning, the government's top health 
protection agency now says ignoring those warnings and holding gatherings could lead directly 
to family members dying from COVID-19." CBS' Kris Van Cleave: "That urgent warning not to 
travel comes as many as 50 million Americans are preparing to do just that - travel for 
Thanksgiving. The CDC is urging anybody who hasn't been home for 14 days, including college 
students coming from campus, not to participate in Thanksgiving plans unless they have 
already quarantined." 
Miguel Almaguer said on NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/19, story 3, 2:30, Holt, 5.84M), "With 
the US facing a crushing wave of patients and a growing number of fatalities, tonight at this 
critical phase, the CDC is now urging all Americans to stay home for Thanksgiving. ... As our 
nation now averages some 1,200 deaths a day, in the Midwest, home to the most dire surge in 
the nation, seven governors, Democrats and Republicans, are sharing the same message" in a 
Thursday Washington Post op-ed: "stay home." 
The Washington Post (11/19, Al, Shammas, 14.2M) reports that in the agency's "first 
news briefing in months, officials said they were alarmed to see 1 million new cases reported 
across the United States within the past week." The AP (11/19, Stobbe, Hollingsworth) says the 
CDC "pleaded with Americans on Thursday not to travel for Thanksgiving and not to spend the 
holiday with people from outside their household." According to the AP, "It was some of the
