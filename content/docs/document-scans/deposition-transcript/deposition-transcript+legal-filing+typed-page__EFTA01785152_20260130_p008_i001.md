May 10, 2013 -- In October 1995= Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin telephoned Egyptian President Hosni =ubarak to 
inform him that peace was at hand between Israel and Syria. Two weeks later, Rabin was dead, killed by a rea=tionary 
Jewish Israeli fanatic; the peace agreement that Rabin referenced =ied not long thereafter. But Israeli hopes for an 
eventual agreement with =he Assad regime managed to survive. There have been four subsequent attempts by Israeli 
prime ministers -- one=by Ehud Barak, one by Ehud Olmert, and two by Benjamin Netanyahu -- to for=e a peace with 
Syria. 
This shared history with the As=ad regime is relevant when considering Israel's strategy toward the ongo=ng civil war in 
Syria. Israel's most significant strategic goal with respect to Syria has always been a stable peace, and t=at is not 
something that the current civil war has changed. Israel will in=ervene in Syria when it deems it necessary; last week's 
attacks testify =o that resolve. But it is no accident that those strikes were focused solely on the destruction of weapons 
depot=, and that Israel has given no indication of wanting to intervene any furt=er. Jerusalem, ultimately, has little 
interest in actively hastening the f=ll of Bashar al-Assad. 
Israel knows one important thin= about the Assads: for the past 40 years, they have managed to preserve so=e form of 
calm along the border. Technically, the two countries have always been at war -- Syria has yet to officially r=cognize 
Israel -- but Israel has been able to count on the governments of =afez and Bashar Assad to enforce the Separation of 
Forces Agreement from 1=74, in which both sides agreed to a cease-fire in the Golan Heights, the disputed vantage 
point along the=r shared border. Indeed, even when Israeli and Syrian forces were briefly =ocked in fierce fighting in 
1982 during Lebanon's civil war, the border =emained quiet. 
Israel does not feel as confide=t, though, about the parties to the current conflict, and with good reason= On the one 
hand, there are the rebel forces, some of whom are increasingly under the sway of al Qaeda. On the other, th=re are the 
Syrian government's military forces, which are still under As=ad's command, but are ever more dependent on the 
Iranian Revolutionary G=ard and Hezbollah, which is also Iranian-sponsored. Iran is the only outside state with boots on 
the ground in Syria, and alth=ugh it is supporting Assad, it is also pressuring his government to more c=osely serve Iran's 
goals -- including by allowing the passage of advance= arms from Syria into southern Lebanon. The recent visit by Iranian 
Foreign Minister Ali Salehi to Damascus, durin= which he announced that Iran would not allow Assad to fall under any 
circ=mstances, further underscored the depth of Iran's involvement in the fig=ting. It is entirely conceivable, in other 
words, that a post-Assad regime in Syria would be explicitly pro=96a1 Qaeda or even more openly pro-Iran. Either result 
would be unacceptab=e to Israel. 
Of course, an extended civil wa= in Syria does not serve Israel's interests either. The ongoing chaos is=attracting 
Islamists from elsewhere in the region, and threatening to destabilize Israel's entire neighborhood, inc=uding Lebanon, 
Jordan, and Iraq. It could also cause Assad to lose control=of -- or decide to rely more on -- his stockpile of chemical 
weapons. 
Even though these problems have=a direct impact on Israel, the Israeli government believes that it should =eal with 
them in a way that does not force it to become a kingmaker over Assad's fate. Instead, it would prefer to =aintain 
neutrality in Syria's civil war. Israel does not want to tempt Ass=d to target Israel with his missile stockpile -- nor does it 
want to alien=te the Alawite community that will remain on Israel's border regardless of the outcome of Syria's war. 
Last week's attacks were a ca=e in point. Israel did not hesitate to order air strikes when it had intel=igence that arms 
were going to be funneled from Syria to Hezbollah. Although Israel took care not to assume official =esponsibility for the 
specific attack, Minister of Defense Moshe Yaalon pu=licly stated that Israel's policy was to prevent the passage of 
strategi= weaponry from Syria to Lebanon. But parallel with that messaging, Israel also made overt and covert effort= to 
communicate to Assad that Jerusalem was determined to remain neutral i= Syria's civil war. The fact that those 
messages were received in Damasc=s was reflected in the relatively restrained response from the Assad regime: a mid-
level Foreign Ministry of=icial offered a public denouncement of Israel -- and even then the Syrian =overnment offered 
only a vague promise of reprisal, vowing to respond at a=time and in a manner of its choosing.
