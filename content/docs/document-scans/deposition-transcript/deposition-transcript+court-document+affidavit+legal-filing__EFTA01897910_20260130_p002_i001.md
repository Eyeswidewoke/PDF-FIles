brothers often involve pledges in exercises of loyalty and trust. Pledges and brothers may also 
have a pledge project they work on together (building something for the house, for example) and 
be in charge of tasks like cleaning up after house parties. Pledges may do things for brothers, like 
serve as a designated driver on weekendslf the brothers feel a pledge has completed his pledge 
education to their satisfaction, he can be initiated into the brotherhood. The actual initiation 
ceremony is shrouded in mystery. It may take several hours and involve chanting, robes, 
blindfolds and candlelight. The pledge will be initiated into the secrets of the fraternity, from 
secret mottoes and grips (handshakes) to passwords and the meanings behind rituals. He will be 
sworn to secrecy. " why not follow the giving pledge with an initiation into the most select 
group, joint project etc. 
many feel that they somewhat are used as pr examples of bills success in convincing them re 
philanthropy, no credit for their choice 
DAF, estate, structured giving, ( a days discussion ) partnered giving, social good bonds.( new 
uk concept ) , govt approved special gates bonds? 
foundation /polio. . foundation to some appears overly bureaucratic, does not make use of 
its unique size reputation or bills unique skill set. 
quotes. 
I am an American, polio is not a problem here, we have our own problems, he is getting a U.S. 
tax break does not seem fair, 
(polio) this is bills deal, he has enough to fix it, why doesn't he step up to the plate instead of 
going with cup in hand asking for personal favors . the money he raised is not based on his 
polio initiatve at all , no one really reads the info, it is a personal appeal nothing more nothihg 
less. slim, bloomberg , prince tawal etc. 
he is so clever in the world of tech, why does he now want to play the role of polictican , is it 
beacause he views the foundaitn as its own govt. why doesn't he merely lobby govt and fund 
projects that are super high risk, energy , infectious disease, etc. 
private foundations could be doing things that only they can, he is getting American tax breaks 
and sending the money to Africa. does not seem right. 
his staff is second rate , and that is being geonerous, to be fair, there arc only a handful of really 
talentedpeople in this area. too much fat , only tells him things he wants to hear. in order to 
keep their jobs, Flattery was a serious crime in the old days , it should be resurrected. 
he left Microsoft and the stock hasn't moved , since he left. he is focused more on African kids, 
and malaria , then his stakeholders ,in Microsoft, shareholders . clients,. employees,  the 
engines of his own wealth. 
he needs an intervention where some wise men sit him down and say what are you doing.? He is 
too smart to be in behind the foundations floundering, it seems to be really run by Melinda and 
her band of do- gooders. why should i help him. He has taken the easy road.
