(e) 
In the case of on demand Transactions, demand for Termination shall 
be made by Buyer or Seller, by telephone or otherwise, and shall provide for 
Termination to occur after not less than the minimum period as is 
customarily required for the settlement or delivery of money or Equivalent 
Securities of the relevant kind. 
(f) 
On the Repurchase Date, Buyer shall transfer to Seller or its agent 
Equivalent Securities against the payment of the Repurchase Price by Seller 
(less any amount then payable and unpaid by Buyer to Seller pursuant to 
paragraph 5). 
4. 
Margin Maintenance 
(a) 
If at any time either party has a Net Exposure in respect of the 
other party it may by notice to the other party require the other party to 
make a Margin Transfer to it of an aggregate amount or value at least equal 
to that Net Exposure. 
(b) 
A notice under subparagraph (a) above may be given orally or in 
writing. 
(c) 
For the purposes of this Agreement a party has a Net Exposure in 
respect of the other party if the aggregate of all the first party's 
Transaction Exposures plus any amount payable to the first party under 
paragraph 5 but unpaid less the amount of any Net Margin provided to the 
first party exceeds the aggregate of all the other party's Transaction 
Exposures plus any amount payable to the other party under paragraph 5 but 
unpaid less the amount of any Net Margin provided to the other party; and 
the amount of the Net Exposure is the amount of the excess. For this purpose 
any amounts not denominated in the Base Currency shall be converted into the 
Base Currency at the Spot Rate prevailing at the relevant time. 
(d) 
To the extent that a party calling for a Margin Transfer has 
previously paid Cash Margin which has not been repaid or delivered Margin 
Securities in respect of which Equivalent Margin Securities have not been 
delivered to it, that party shall be entitled to require that such Margin 
Transfer be satisfied first by the repayment of such Cash Margin or the 
delivery of Equivalent Margin Securities but, subject to this, the 
composition of a Margin Transfer shall be at the option of the party making 
such Margin Transfer. 
Any Cash Margin transferred shall be in the Base Currency or such other 
currency as the parties may agree. 
(f) 
A payment of Cash Margin shall give rise to a debt owing from the 
party receiving such payment to the party making such payment. Such debt 
shall bear interest at such rate, payable at such times, as may be specified 
in Annex I hereto in respect of the relevant currency or otherwise agreed 
between the parties, and shall be repayable subject to the terms of this 
Agreement. 
(g) 
Where Seller or Buyer becomes obliged under subparagraph (a) above 
to make a Margin Transfer, it shall transfer Cash Margin or Margin 
Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities within the minimum period 
specified in Annex I hereto or, if no period is there specified, such 
minimum period as is customarily required for the settlement or delivery of 
money, Margin Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities of the relevant 
kind 
(h) 
The parties may agree that, with respect to any Transaction, the 
provisions of subparagraphs (a) to (g) above shall not apply but instead
