"Beef Stew" 
The man behind the tome is a former chie= technology officer for Microsoft and an inventor of hundreds of patents (=e 
invented an electromagnetic car engine and is seeking a patent for his F=ench fries treated with starch and placed in an 
ultrasonic bath). Though m=ny of Mr. Myhrvold's 51 years have been devoted to math and science—=y the age of 23, he 
held two master's degrees and a doctorate in mathemati=al physics from Princeton—in the 1990s, his passion for food 
began t= loom large. First, he got deeply into barbecue (he was on the "team =f the year" at the Memphis World 
Championship Barbecue Cooking Contes= in 1991), and then moved onto haute cuisine. 
"My=career at Microsoft really was getting in the way of my cooking," sai= Mr. Myhrvold. After leaving Microsoft in 
1999, he launched Intellectual V=ntures, an invention and patent firm, and in 2007, with help from two youn=, 
scientifically-minded chefs, Chris Young and Maxime Bilet, he began work=on the book. When publishers balked over 
the size and scope of the project= Mr. Myhrvold said, he ditched the conventional route and decided to self-=ublish 
through his publishing company, the Cooking Lab.<=p> 
To call=inventor Nathan Myhrvold's "Modernist Cuisine: The Art & Science =f Cooking," on sale next month, a 
"cookbook" is akin to cal=ing James Joyce's "Ulysses" "a story." 
Among the book's revelations: Expensive pots and pans are a waste of m=ney. Organic food is no healthier than non-
organic. Black coffee cools off=faster than coffee with cream. 
We pored over the book =nd selected some of our favorite counterintuitive nuggets of wisdom. You'l= never think about 
frying, boiling or making pizza the same way again. 
PROBLEM #1: Your pan-fried food comes 
out soggy and greasy. 
SOLUTION: Use more oil. </=:p> 
Before shallow-frying, pour oil into a pan that is equivalent=to nearly half the depth of your food. Heat it well and fry the 
food. When=done, drain on a rack and blot excess oil with paper towels. The food will=be crisp and less greasy than if 
you had skimped on the oil. 
WHAT'S GOING ON: When food heat=, water escaping from the food creates a tiny layer of steam that lifts th= food off 
the bottom of the pan. If there's not enough oil in the pan, the=food will not make contact with the oil. That means that 
instead of frying= it steams, and then merely absorbs the oil, sponge-like, upon contact. Wi=h a thick enough layer of oil 
the food will have full surface-contact with=the oil and will fry—and properly fried food does not actually absor= much 
oil. 
PROBLEM #2: The first batches of yo=r deep-fried food don't come out crispy enough. 
SOLUTION: Use a bit of old oil. 
Each time you deep fry, cool down t=e used oil and keep a couple of tablespoons in the refrigerator. Next time=you 
deep fry, add about a tablespoon of the old oil to the pot along with =resh oil, and bring it to temperature for about 10 
minutes before frying. =o:p>
