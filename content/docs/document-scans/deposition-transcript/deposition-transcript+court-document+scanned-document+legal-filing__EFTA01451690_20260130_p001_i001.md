to the tax status of any particular Limited Partner (such as the availability of tax treaty

non-U.S. status of any Partner), to be required either (i) to file an income tax return in

other taxes imposed on such Limited Partner or any of its partners by any taxing authority

which would be imposed on the General Partner or the Fund of complying with such 
request

recover for such Limited Partner any taxes withheld or paid by the Fund with respect to 
such Limited Partner, if such filings may be made or such action taken by the General 
Partner in its capacity as general partner of the Fund and may not be made or taken by 
such Limited Partner on its own behalf, provided that in determining the reasonableness 
of a request, the General Partner shall be entitled to consider the cost which would be 
imposed on the General Partner or the Fund of complying with such request For the 
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.10(d), (0 the

documentation if the General Partner determines in its sole discretion that so doing would 
create an undue burden on the Fund or the General Partner, (ii) nothing in this Section
