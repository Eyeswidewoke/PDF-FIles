OptiOpia, Inc. Business Plan for Jeffrey Epstein 
April I. 201 I 
ways to add information to markets, and reductions in market-destroying information 
asymmetries. The vast underserved market of emerging economies is very different 
from the American and European vision screening market, 
In summary: without licensed eyecare personnel, an accurate and affordable 
autorefractor in lightly regulated eyecare markets that are starved of trained 
optometrists and ophthalmologists will help improve access, quality and affordability 
of eyecare for populations with youthful demographics, which characterizes much of 
the developing world. We shall now detail the scope of the commercial opportunity in 
the developing world and the potential societal benefits of our project to these 
populations. 
In the developing world, there are two important problems in addition to vision 
screening that the low cost autorefractor seeks to address: 1) the very large number 
of people in the developing world who need glasses but don't have them, 2) the low 
quality of prescriptive accuracy in the developing world. 
In many countries — such as India, Bangladesh, and China -- eyeglass peddlers sell 
glasses with very low prescriptive accuracy. Astigmatism is frequently 
misunderstood, myopia is over-corrected, and hyperopia not properly diagnosed. 
This results in very low customer satisfaction. OptiOpia's precursor venture, Low 
Cost Eyeglasses, conducted a survey in Tamil Nadu, India, and found that 21% of 
current glasses users are highly dissatisfied with their glasses. 
The problems described above are the result of 1) the dependence upon a limited 
resource: the trained optometrist or ophthalmologist, and 2) the lack of a reliable, cost 
efficient technology to provide refraction by less trained personnel. 
The lower number of optometrists and ophthalmologists in the developing world 
enables optometrists to focus on wealthy urban customers. For example, a World 
Health Organization study of seven Anglophone countries in Africa found that the 
respective percentage of ophthalmologists who lived in their country's capital city was 
66%, 30%,100%, 50%, 65%, 78%, and 74% (IAPB, 2002), yet the majority of the 
population of Africa lives in rural and in mid-sized towns (World Bank, 2001). In 
some areas, such as in Africa and Latin America, the lack of optometrists causes a 
restriction in supply and an artificially high price given the ability to pay. In Jamaica, 
where there are fewer than one optometrist per 100,000 people (World Council of 
Optometry, 2002), and 60% of the population lives in households with a daily gross 
national income per capita of less than $6 (Branko, 1999), the cheapest pair of 
glasses available costs $56 (Low Cost Eyeglasses, 2002a, 2002b; Help The World 
See, 2002) — more than nine times the daily income, and more than 15 times the 
factory cost of the glasses. Frames and lenses themselves cost very little to produce: 
plastic frames can be bought in bulk from Chinese factories for less than $0.50, and 
glass lenses can also be bought for less than $0.50 a pair. All of the expense (and 
profit) is in the channel. To understand this situation on a global basis, our precursor 
firm Low Cost Eyeglasses, Inc. conducted a global survey in January of 2002 
(www.lowcosteveolasses.net).
