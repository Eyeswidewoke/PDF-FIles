DISH — BUY: Each time DISH bonds back up we revisit our thesis, but generally 
always come back to three tenets: it's one of the best cash generators relative 
to total debt in our coverage space (FCF / debt of nearly 10%), the concerns 
around the industry and specifically DISH's business model are overdone, and 
there's an asset on Network's balance sheet (spectrum) that we believe will 
also help propel forward the legacy DBS side of the house. 
It's a mature business and management has been very vocal and honest about 
that, but as we mentioned in our Cable / Pay-TV overview, the inevitable 
acceleration of the decline in linear-TV hasn't materialized in the way bears 
predicted. Additionally, the DBS industry has been quick to transition to take 
advantage of the growing demand for OTT services and has created two of the 
best services in the industry. They're lower margin subs absolutely, but it 
stems the impact of outright losing all the cash from the churned DBS 
subscribers. Given the maturity of the business, we also expect the Restricted 
Group to de-lever, particularly as DISH exists its spectrum accumulation phase 
and pivots towards one of spectrum commercialization. At nearly 7% we think 
DISH remains cheap. 
DISH 7.75% Sr Notes due 2023: $105.50, 6.89%, 440 bps 
Intelsat - BUY Longer-Dated Jackson: It's been another whirlwind year for 
Intelsat - a failed Softbank deal, liability management exercises, potential 
monetization of spectrum assets, multiple Epic satellite launches, industry 
multiple contraction amongst its peer group. While the fundamentals of the 
business remain in flux with the ex-mobility growth in Network Services yet to 
turnaround, an approaching media renewal cycle that will have a hit to 
revenues, and -20% of government contracts up for renewal in 2018, we still 
think there is value at Jackson with additional value to be had in the longer-
dated '23s and '25s. 
Despite near-term headwinds, Intelsat has gone through certain various capital 
structure activities to extend the maturity wall, effectively buying the company 
more time to prove the use case for the next gen HIS works. Guidance for 
2018 is now widely expected to be flat to down from an EBITDA perspective (a 
phenomenon that can be seen explained via the recent moves in Lux bonds), 
but management remains confident that the only issue up for debate is one of 
timing on when growth will return. As we progress through 2018 and the 
company becomes more positive about the trajectory of the business into 
2019, we think the Jackson box certainly rallies. Further, as the industry 
overall begins to trend closer towards the inflection point in HTS vs legacy 
services, we think industry valuations will improve, providing further cushion 
to the Jackson story.
