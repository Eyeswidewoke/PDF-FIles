Turning to your letter, about the fa=ily relationship, we can put that aside. That's stable, enduring, permanent.=font 
size="3"> 
The rest of the letter, however, I f=nd puzzling. I'll explain. And these are matters we ought to clear up. 
You say that there is "some major disagreement about what the basic facts are" and that there is a difference of 
perspectives. That&=39;s what I find puzzling. I don't know of any disagreement about the basic facts, and I know of 
only one perspective: the one I outlined in my letters. I reported what the facts are -- will review the matter briefly 
again below -- and outlined my perspective, based on the only relev=nt facts I know of, which to my knowledge are 
complete. I'm not awa=e of any other relevant facts, hence see no basis for any other perspective (whatever that 
perspective may be). 
If I'm missing some facts, basic or not, I'd of course like to be a=are of them, and also of the source for them so that I can 
check and discover on what the picture is based. But since I haven't heard of any ot=er facts beyond those I outlined 
(and more that simply fill out the same pictu=e), I don't understand the disagreement and don't see any alternative 
p=rspective. And I don't understand the suggestion about an outside "expert."=C2 In fact, find the suggestion very 
strange, and would even if there were some factual basis for it. Even stranger when there is no factual basis, as far as I 
am aware -- and if there is, again, I'd like to know what i= is and, crucially, what is the source. So far I haven't seen 
anyt=ing. 
To review the basic facts briefly, M=mmoy and I worked out the estate planning a long time ago, with Eric Menoyo and 
(later) Palmer Dodge when he moved there. Our general plan at that time, about 20 years ago, was for everything to go 
to you after the two of us died. We took for granted that M would survive me. Therefore, putting aside the trusts 
designated specifically for you, the rest (apart from IRAs) was put in trusts in M's name for her to acc=ss for the rest of 
her life. The intention, of course, was that these would be accessible to the survivor — and we took for granted that = 
would survive me. 
Things didn't turn out as we=expected. It turned out, contrary to our assumptions, that I was the survivor, not M. And 
when I remarried, things changed again. Because the pension went almost entirely into M's trust, what remains of the 
pe=sion is very small, actually less than Social Security. And, importantly, it doesn't go to Valeria after my death. And I 
have no access to the tr=sts, only to one IRA (and another small one). 
I wasn't paying much attention, =ut we discovered that until last year, the one IRA to which I have access was being used 
to distribute money to the family, up to the legal limit, which amounts to about half the annual required withdrawals 
from the IRA. Furthermo=e, taxes and management fees for the whole estate, most of which we have no access to, 
were being withdrawn from our IRA, carrying us well beyond the required withdrawal. In addition there were other 
expenses, like Wellfleet ($50,00O annually), Alex's annual medical bills, Max's bi=ls, and others. That has all led to rapid 
depletion of the IRA -- again, the only source we have access to in the estate. We were therefore compelled to make 
extra withdrawals, since there is almost no other source of income and we have other regular expenses (like Anthony). 
The family distributions along with full taxes and management fees for the whole estate, exhausting the IRA, made no 
sense, but it was my fault=C2 for not paying attention and simply assuming that sensible decisions were being made. 
Wrongly it turns out.
