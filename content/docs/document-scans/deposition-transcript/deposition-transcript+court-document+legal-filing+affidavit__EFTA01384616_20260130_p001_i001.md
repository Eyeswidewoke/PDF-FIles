(g) The General Partner shall give at least 15 days' prior written notice to 
each Limited Partner that is a BHC Limited Partner (as defined below) of any proposal to 
distribute property in kind to such Limited Partner and the proposed date of such 
distribution, and shall not make any such distribution in kind to the extent that such 
Limited Partner advises the General Partner at least five days prior to the date set forth in 
such notice for such distribution that such distribution in kind could reasonably be 
expected to cause it to violate the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the 
"BHCA"). A "BHC Limited Partner" shall mean any Limited Partner that is, or is an 
affiliate of, a bank holding company (as defined in Section 2(a) of the BHCA) that is 
subject to the provisions of Regulation Y issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System. 
Sec. 5.06 
Effective Date of Withdrawal. Unless otherwise specified herein, 
the effective date of a Partner's withdrawal shall mean (i) the Withdrawal Date in the case of a 
withdrawal pursuant to Sec. 5.02(a) or the last day of the first fiscal quarter ending three months 
after the Notice Date in the case of a withdrawal pursuant to Sec. 5.03, or (ii) the date determined 
by the General Partner if such Partner shall be required to withdraw from the Partnership 
pursuant to Sec. 5.04. In the event the Withdrawal Date of a Partner shall be a date other than 
the last day of a fiscal year of the Partnership, the Capital Account of the withdrawing Partner 
shall be adjusted pursuant to Sec. 3.05(a) as if the Withdrawal Date of such Partner's withdrawal 
were the last day of a fiscal year. 
Sec. 5.07 
Limitations on Withdrawal of Capital Account. 
(a) The right of any Partner or its legal representatives to withdraw any 
amount from its Capital Account and to have distributed to it any such amount (or any 
portion thereof) pursuant to this Article V is subject to the provision by the General 
Partner for all Partnership liabilities in accordance with the Act and for reserves or 
holdbacks for contingencies (even if such reserves or holdbacks are not in accordance 
with GAAP procedures) and estimated accrued expenses and liabilities in accordance 
with Sec. 3.08. In addition, no withdrawal shall be permitted that would result in a 
Capital Account having a negative balance. The unused portion of any reserve shall be 
distributed to the Partners to which the reserve applied, with interest, as determined by 
the General Partner, after the General Partner shall have determined that the need therefor 
shall have ceased. 
(b) The General Partner may suspend the offering of Interests, withdrawal 
rights and the payment of withdrawal proceeds, in whole or in part, (i) during any period 
when any stock exchange or over-the-counter market on which the Master Fund's or the 
Old Domestic Fund's investments are quoted, traded or dealt is closed, other than for 
ordinary holidays and weekends, or during periods in which dealings are restricted or 
suspended; (ii) during the existence of any state of affairs as a result of which, in the 
opinion of the General Partner, disposal of investments by Master Fund or the Old 
Domestic Fund, or the determination of the value of the withdrawing Limited Partner's 
Capital Account would not be reasonably practicable or where permitting withdrawals or 
paying the withdrawal proceeds would, in the opinion of the General Partner, be seriously 
prejudicial to the non-withdrawing Limited Partners; (iii) during any breakdown in the
