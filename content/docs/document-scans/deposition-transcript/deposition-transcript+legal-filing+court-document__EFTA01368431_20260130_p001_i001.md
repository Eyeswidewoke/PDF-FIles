(a) 
On or as soon as practicable following a Data Delivery Date, each party shall perform a 
Data Reconciliation against SDR Data to the extent that such SDR Data relates to 
Material Terms that would otherwise be delivered by the other party as Portfolio Data 
To the extent that either party does not have access to such SDR Data or determines that 
it is not technologically or operationally practical for such party to obtain such data from 
the relevant swap data repository in a manner that permits the conduct of a timely Data 
Reconciliation, such party shall notify the other party by or as soon as practicable after 
the relevant Data Delivery Date. 
(b) 
Neither party shall be obligated to deliver Portfolio Data to the other party on a Data 
Delivery Date to the extent that such Portfolio Data consists of Material Terms data 
reported to a swap data repository, provided, however, that if a party has notified the 
other party that it is not able to conduct a timely Data Reconciliation against 
corresponding SDR Data, the parties shall provide for the delivery of the relevant 
Portfolio Data, as applicable, as soon as reasonably practicable. 
(c) 
If either party identifies a Discrepancy in SDR Data, such party shall immediately notify 
the other party of such Discrepancy. Each party agrees to consult with the other in an 
attempt to resolve any such Discrepancy in a timely fashion. 
(d) 
DB agrees to notify Client, upon reasonable request, of (0 the swap data repository to 
which DB has reported Material Terms data with respect to swaps between DB and 
Client and (ii) any changes to the swap data repositories that must be accessed to obtain 
such data. 
Either party may provide written notice to the other party to terminate the reconciliation 
procedures described in this Part Upon the effective date of such written notice, these 
procedures shall have no further force or effect and the parties will each be released and 
discharged from all further obligations hereunder. The parties agree that the effective 
date of any such notice is the second Joint Business Day following the date on which 
such notice is delivered.

OTHER PORTFOLIO RECONCILIATION PROCEDURES 
6.1 
In the event that the parties have agreed to multiple Data Delivery Dates with a frequency 
specified in a Required Reconciliation Date Notice, DB shall notify Client if, at any time during 
the period that such Data Delivery Dates are in effect, it is no longer required to conduct portfolio 
reconciliations with the specified frequency. Such notice shall specify (i) the new frequency with 
which portfolio reconciliations are believed by DB to be required and (ii) the new applicable Data 
Delivery Dates. Upon delivery of such a notice, the parties obligations to deliver Portfolio Data 
on the previously agreed Data Delivery Dates shall terminate, and such notice shall be a new 
Required Reconciliation Date Notice for purposes of these procedures. 
6.2 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Protocol, the parties may in good faith agree to 
any other procedure for (i) the exchange, delivery and/or reconciliation of Portfolio Data, and/or 
(ii) the resolution of any discrepancy between them, in either case whether in addition to or in 
substitution of the procedures set out herein.
