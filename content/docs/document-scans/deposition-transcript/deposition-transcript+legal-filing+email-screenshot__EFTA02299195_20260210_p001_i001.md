Fwd: Cleaning of apartment 10N today 
OK so I have spoken to best Home Services and they can go into 11P for an h=ur from 5 until 6 to do the bathroom. 
Karyna the amount that=will now need to go into the envelope marked for Mary will be 5100.=A0 I would like you to 
meet the cleaning lady, Lenore, in the lobby at 2.=0pm. To give her the envelope with the money, the laundry card, 
show her t=e laundry room and take her up to 10N. 
Then if you could please =o to l0N just before
 to take her to 11P. 
The code for 10N that you should give her is 
. I think you will n=ed to write it down for her as she will be going 
between the apartment and=the laundry room a few times. 
Lyn, can you=please also buy a mop and bucket for 11P and any bathroom cleaner they may=need. I know you said that 
there are cleaning products in the apartment an= it doesnt matter if they are different brands but please do purchase if 
t=ere is nothing similar to each of the items. for eg: scouring powder of wi=dow/glass cleaner.

I have a cleaning service coming today=at 2.30pm to clean 10N. Lesley can you please send me the code for l0N as = 
always use the master code to get into the apartments and I do not want t= give this to the cleaners. 
Lyn and Jojo, I know you are waiting for delivery of the mattresses,=could you please look at the list of cleaning things 
the agency has given =e and compare with what is in l0N and purchase any missing items. Can you =lso please make 
sure there is a vacuum cleaner in 10N and an ironing board=and iron. (list is at end of email) 
THis is basically the best agency I have been in contact with. THe mana=er is very precise and has phoned me about 5 
times to confirm things, and =he sent me an email with cleaners name and all the details which I have no= had with any 
of the others. 
She told me they will come in, strip the beds, take the towels and bedd=ng straight down to the laundry, put them in the 
washer, come back up and =o the kitchen and living areas, then back to the laundry to put in drier, =hen into apartment 
to do bathroom and bedroom , then last thing, get the c=ean linen and make the bed up. 
Karyna I would love to ask for your help and have checked with J= that it is ok, so unless he has given you something else 
to do since then=it would be great if you could help with the following. We need to leave m=ney in a sealed envelope in 
the apartment with Mary Cavanaugh, Best Home S=rvices written on the envelope. I will confirm the exact amount with 
you s=ortly. It is approximately $80, so if you could collect from Bella that wo=ld be great. Alternatively you could use
