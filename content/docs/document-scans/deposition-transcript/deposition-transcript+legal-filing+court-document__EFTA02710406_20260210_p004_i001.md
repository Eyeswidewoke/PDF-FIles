brain as a computer? as silly as artificial in=elligence., The simple example I teach re quantum is whe= 
i try to decide should i order fish or meat. for the moment before I order ( as you an I agree ms before i even am 
concious of ordering. ) both choices like schroedingers cat exist as a superpostioned wave func=ion that collapses and a 
choice is made. . yes i a= taking liberties.. the students you referred to you suggest are working on computers, not 
very odd that they might see you I lan=uage conforming to their pre perceptions

I will take your word that you share my thick skin f=r criticism and share a strange pleasure in 
learning, even if it mea=s having to accept that some formerly closely held beliefs might need strong correction. I 
have no particular knowl=dge re politics or history, so I will never offer an opinion. =owever re mathematics and or 
money, I feel on strong ground. =hat being said, thought puzzles in the paper are brilliant and=insightful. the 
mathematical descriptions lack rigor , and the metaphors suffer =rom the common science limitation of trying to 
describe things using the e=gineering metaphors or the tools of the moment.ex. The =uman or its brain as a computer 
., set theory . It was popular in the early 20th as you know to describe the body as an elect=ic machine.. the 
mathematics used today in quantum show =ore promise , as it attempts to describe things that appear counter
