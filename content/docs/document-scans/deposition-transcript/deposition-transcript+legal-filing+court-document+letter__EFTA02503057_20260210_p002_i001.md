flooding or leak from the roof. I HAVE TO GO WITH ALTERNATIVE =ESTORATION. I am presuming Mr. Epstein loves the

with time create spots. Oak contains iron, which in turn will create =n the surface dark spots. Right now, we have 
thousands tiny dark spots, =hich can be eliminated. The darkening of the wood can be confirmed by =11 the peoples 
witnessing to it. 
> I am coming with the solution to this problem. I will strip and =ash all the wood.. I will emphasize the 
grain of the wood but than I =ill seal it may be even two times and finish with varnish (satin) =inish. Once this is sealed 
and finished, I will rub the surfaces with =he steel wool and apply the wax finish. I could apply liming-wax finish =s well.

moisture from environment and uses it =or its own purpose.

finish the rest of the Library in =he same way.

lasting restoration.
