HEADLINE: HARVARD TO KEEP EPSTEIN GIFT 
BYLINE: CAROL BEGGY & MARK SIIANAHAN 
BODY: 
Harvard has decided it'll hold onto the fat check it received from  Jeffrey 
Epstein , the 
billionaire financier who was:  Charged over the summer with soliciting sex frail prostltutes. While 
some others, notably New York gubernatorial candidate Eliot Spitzer and New Mexico Governor Bill 
Richardson , have returned his gifts, the World's Greatest University has concluded that returning 
Epstein's 56.5 million donation would do more harm than good. "Mr. Epstein's gift is funding 
important research using mathematics to study areas such as evolutionary theory, viruses, and 
cancers," a Harvard spokesman told us yesterday. "Harvard has no plans to return the gift." (Epstein 
has pledged up to $30 million to support the research being done by Harvard mathematical biologist 
Martin Nowak .) Epstein was charged with solicitation in July after several teenage girls told the 
Palm Beach police they'd given the silver-haired money manager massages in exchange for cash. 
Epstein, who's being defended by Harvard law professor Alan DershowItv , has pled not guilty. In 
1979, Harvard prez Derek Bok explained his rationale for accepting controversial gifts this way: "I 
would be inclined to accept such donations on the ground that the tangible benefits of using the 
money . 
. should overcome the more abstract, symbolic considerations that might lead us to turn 
down such benefactions." 
KYRA'S GAME FOR ROLE OPPOSITE ROCK 
It'll be Kyra Sedgwick not Bebe Neuwirth playing opposite Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson when Disney 
finally begins: zhoot tug ^The Game Plan^ later this: month. ^The Rock^ plays: a fictitious: NFL 
quarterback in the big-budget football flick, and Sedgwick is his hard-nosed agent. (The movie was 
supposed to shoot in Boston over the summer, but had to be postponed when "The Rock" ruptured hi:: 
Achilles tendon preparing for the role.) Neuwirth, who is returning to Broadway in the musical 
"Chicago," dropped out because of scheduling conflicts, according to published reports. Previously 
announced cast members, including Madison Pettis , Roselyn Sanchez , Morris Chestnut , Gordon Clapp 
, and Boston funnyman Lenny Clarke , all are still expected to appear in the film, which is being 
directed by Andy Fickman . Judging from a Q&A in the new issue of Entertainment Weekly, it would 
appear "The Rock" can't wait to return to the area. Asked what he'd eaten to put on 30 pounds, the 
onetime pro wrestler responds: "Large cheese pizza and doughnuts. The pizza needs to be from 
Avellino's near Boston." . . . In other movie news, Acton's own Steve Carell will provide the voice 
for the mayor of Whoville in the animated version of "Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who" starring Jim 
Carrey as Horton.
