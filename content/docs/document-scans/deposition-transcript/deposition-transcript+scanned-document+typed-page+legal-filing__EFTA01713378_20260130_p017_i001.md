the Urban League, Harlem Children's Zone, and UCLA, among others. Some portion of the other half of his 
life is spent being glamorous. He's invested in Scoop, the fancy boutique chain, and has anonymously 
underwritten model enthusiasms, like his $200,000 contribution to Petra Nemcova's charity benefit for 
tsunami victims. His stunning home in Los Angeles, Green Acres, is the most exceptional charity-event space 
in the city—Wo million has been raised there in the past year, with $1 million at a recent Clinton event. This 
fall, when the California governor asked his help, he flew the Dalai Lama from New York and back. 
It's difficult to live in the public eye while keeping full control of your image, even for a billionaire, as Burkle 
found when he made the acquaintance of a "Page Six" writer of questionable wardrobe and integrity named 
Jared Paul Stern. Burkle caught Stern on tape allegedly trying to shake him down—but possibly in this case 
the cure.was worse than the disease, with Burkle, by many accounts an ordinary guy who does his own 
laundry, suddenly as famous as Brad Pitt. 
To defend his zone of privacy, Burkle has put together a fearsome, cloak-and-daggerish security apparatus, 
including crisis manager Mike Sibick (who was brought in to quiet things down when hedge-fund manager 
Bruce McMahan was accused of conducting an affair with his own daughter) and Frank Renzi (who was in 
President Clinton's Secret Service detail). 
His wife—who petitioned for alimony of $410,000 per month but eventually received S40,000—provided a 
sobering view of the end of billionaire romance: "My husband is enormously wealthy, a billionaire, has his 
own 7S7 jet, and literally could track me down anywhere in the world," she testified. "He is used to exerting 
control over all the people he comes into contact with, including myself ... He cannot stand losing—
anything!" 
It may not always be this way with billionaires. The new crop of Internet billionaires seem to have learned 
from the example of their forerunners and are determined to live life differently in the "Gooveau Riche" era. 
Sergey Brin and Larry Page guard their privacy so closely that little is known about where they live other than 
it's in Palo Alto, and the most impressive cars they own are Priuses. When Brin and Page met with the 
Stanford grad students who started YouTube to negotiate the deal earlier this week, it was for lunch at a 
Denny's. They do, however, own their own Boeing 767 jet, which includes two bedrooms and hammocks hung 
from the common-room ceiling. 
Hammocks may not be the style of billionaire Roustam Tariko, the Russian banking and vodka tycoon, but he 
has a similarly freewheeling approach to life. Tariko had one of the city's most incredible parties at the foot of 
the Statue of Liberty, to toast his new brand of vodka. Over a thousand people, dressed in their finest bling, 
gathered there to eat borscht and caviar under the lit statue. I remember Tariko running around, slightly 
flushed in a pressed suit with a crisp white collar, greeting everyone from Helena Christensen to Donna 
Karan as Duran Duran played their old hits onstage. 
More recently, it was rumored he'd bought Picasso's Dora Maar With Cat for $95 million. Tariko told Lillian 
Ross that he had done nothing of the sort. "Not me," he said. "Art dealers from all over the world arc now 
asking me to buy Picassos, other Impressionists. I prefer Renaissance, Caravaggio. But I do not buy them. I'd 
rather invest in my freedom, rather than in my walls."
