Climate Groups Were Counting on $20 Billion. President Trump Won't Let Them Access It. 
The New York Times (03/04, Friedman, Brown, Savage) reported that two weeks after their bank accounts were 
frozen amid a swirl of investigations by the Trump administration, nonprofit organizations that were supposed to 
receive $20 billion to help curb climate change are still unable to withdraw money, raising concerns about their 
ability to pay staff. According to the article, the accounts were frozen by Citibank, which holds the money, after Lee 
Zeldin, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, suggested there was potential fraud and the FBI and 
DOJ launched investigations. Those inquiries went forward despite the determination by a top federal prosecutor 
that there was not enough evidence to open a grand jury criminal probe. The article stated that Zeldin has criticized 
the policy and the structure of the program that was created by Congress and run by the Biden administration. He 
called for the money to be returned to the federal government. This week, he asked for a third, concurrent 
investigation by his agency's acting inspector general. Breitbart (03/04, Moran) also reported on the story. 
Dozens of Canadians Are Charged in $21 Million 'Grandparent Scam' 
The New York Times (03/04, Sanders) reported that more than two dozen Canadians defrauded hundreds of 
vulnerable Americans out of $21 million over three years in what the authorities called a "Grandparent Scam." The 
article added that on Tuesday, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Vermont announced that 25 Canadian nationals had 
been charged with conspiring to defraud Americans in 45 states. All of those accused are from Ontario or Quebec, 
and 23 had been arrested in Canada as of Tuesday afternoon, prosecutors said. According to prosecutors, the 
conspirators placed phone calls from centers in and near Montreal between the summer of 2021 and June 4, 2024, 
as part of the scheme. The 25 Canadians whose indictments were unsealed on Tuesday joined nine Americans who 
had previously been charged in the "Grandparent Scam;' the authorities said. The article mentioned that the 
FBI warned that grandparent schemes targeting older adults are common. A DOJ press release noted that the case 
was investigated under the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF). OCDETF identifies, disrupts, 
and dismantles the highest-level criminal organizations that threaten the United States using a prosecutor-led, 
intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach. NBC News (03/04, Romero) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: Search for Missing Two-Year-Old Boy Dane Paulsen in Oregon Now Focuses on River 
ABC News (03/04, Forrester) reported that a massive search continues for an Oregon toddler who was reported 
missing on Saturday afternoon, according to the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department. At a news conference 
Tuesday, authorities said they are now concentrating their search for 2-year-old Dane Paulsen along the Siletz River 
near his home, saying the evidence now indicates the toddler was at the river's edge before his disappearance. The 
boy was reported missing at approximately 4:25 p.m. Saturday and was last seen playing in the front yard of his 
family's Siletz, Oregon, home, "out of sight of his parents," the sheriffs department said in a statement on Sunday. 
The article mentioned that the Lincoln County Major Crime Team and the FBI are also assisting with the 
investigation and any new leads, authorities said. The FBI's Victim Service Division is also providing resources to 
Paulsen's family, officials said. As of Tuesday, at least 195 tips have been investigated, according to the sheriff's 
department. KATU (ABC-2) (03/04, Slaughter, Aljobory), and the Daily Mail (03/04, Gable) also reported on the 
story. 
Rep. Kiley Calls for FBI to Investigate California High-Speed Rail Project 
KCRA (NBC-3) (03/04, Weber) reported that California Congressman Kevin Kiley on Tuesday formally requested that 
Director Patel open an investigation into the state's high-speed rail project. Shortly after, the California High-Speed 
Rail Authority responded, saying it welcomed the investigation. According to the article, in a letter shared on social 
media platform X, Kiley called the high-speed rail project an issue that deserves Director Patel's attention. The 
request for an investigation comes one month after President Donald Trump called it the "worst managed 
project" he's ever seen and said he would also investigate it. The U.S. Secretary of Transportation also announced a 
review of the project last month. The bullet train between San Francisco and Los Angeles was originally passed by 
voters as Proposition 1A in 2008 with an estimated $33 billion price tag. It has since swelled to a cost of more than 
$120 billion, and most of the money needed to complete it has yet to materialize. To date, $13 billion has been 
spent, according to the state. The article quoted Kiley, who said, "Because the project has consumed billions in 
federal funding, the FBI has both the authority, and I would argue the responsibility, to pursue these questions and 
deliver answers to the American people. The Public Integrity Division is uniquely qualified to root out any
