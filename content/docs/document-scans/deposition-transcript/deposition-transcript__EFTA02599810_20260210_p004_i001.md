1. 
As a starting point, let me note that I t=ink you and Rich may have misunderstood (at least initially) 
the terms of =he settlement that Harry proposed through his attorney. Rich and I discussed this in a call about 10 days 
ago and I'm hopi=g that misunderstanding has been cleared up, but as I'm not a part= to your exchanges (and Rich's 
exchanges) with Harry's att=rney I can't be sure. I'm also not certain whether t=e terms of the proposed settlement 
have changed. All I can say for sure is that=characterizing the offer as one in which distributions to you cannot excee= 
$100K per year is not consistent with my understanding of what has been o=fered. 
The reason why the proposal is too outrageous=to discuss has nothing to do with the technicalities of 
the handout that H=rry is graciously offering. I'll review the background, once again. 
</= iv> 
As I've discussed before, the Marital Tru=t was established in Carol's name for tax purposes. The 
obvious =ntention, clearly understood by Carol and me, and of course Eric Menouya, was that it would be available to 
the survivor -- Carol we assumed -- and =hen what remains would go to the beneficiaries. The idea that we int=nded 
that Carol would control "her" funds and I would control &q=ot;mine" is too ludicrous to discuss, though I understand 
the legalistic conjuring that can be adduced to reach this conclusion.Q=A0 As you note, I was not working with you at 
the time=you and Carol drew up your wills and trusts, but what you describe is not =onsistent with Eric's notes (which I 
have), nor with the facts as I understand them. You are right that tax savings were = major driver to the planning (and 
the plan did in fact result in substantial savings of both estate and income =axes) but it was not drafted with the 
expectation that Carol would survive=you.

color:rgb(255,255,255);text-decoration-style:initial;text-decora=ion-colorinitial">The question of who would be the 
survivor is irrelevant= Carol and I assumed that she would be the survivor, but there was n= reason to tell anyone, and it 
has no bearing at all on the fact that our =ntention was that the principal would be available to the survivor, then g=ing 
to the children 
=/div> 
The decision to fu=d Carol's trust with both financial assets and your Cape and Lexin=ton homes was 
made whet 
as already ill and (as far as the notes indicate) with th= expectation that she would predecease you. 
=/div> 
<=iv> 
This is quite surprising, and=I would like some clarification. Most important, I don't see how=any 
significant decisions could have been made during those years, who cou=d have made them, or why it was done. 
Obviousl
could not have=done so. She had to undergo massive brain radiation as soon as the b=opsy was taken, 
and serious cognitive and physical decline was immediate.=C240 Nor could I have been involved. I very much wanted to 
keep her=at home, rather than the only alternative -- a nursing home. I manag=d to do so for two years, until the end, 
but it required 24-hour care, and=l was in no position to think about such matters. If I had been info=med -- I don't 
recall anything of the sort -- I couldn't have paid=any attention or granted truly informed consent. So I would like to 
=earn more about these decisions. 
Secondly, I don't understand them. How could=the Cape and Lexington homes fund the Trust? Did the 
funds from sell=ng the Lexington house go to the Trust? How was it funded before.40=A0 Would appreciate clarification 
on this. 
Of course we knew by then that she would =redecease me. It was a medical miracle that she was able 
to survive =hat long, on experimental drugs, as a last resort.
