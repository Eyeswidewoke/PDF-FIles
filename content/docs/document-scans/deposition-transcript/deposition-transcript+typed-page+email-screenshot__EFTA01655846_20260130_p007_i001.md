Florida Prosecutors Knew Epstein Raped Teenage Girls Two Years Before Cutting Deal, Transcript Shows 
The Associated Press (07/01, Spencer) reported that Florida prosecutors knew the late millionaire and 
financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually assaulted teenage girls two years before they cut a plea deal that has long been 
criticized as too lenient and a missed opportunity to imprison him a decade earlier, according to transcripts 
released Monday. The article added that the 2006 grand jury investigation was the first of many by law 
enforcement over the past two decades into Epstein's rape and sex trafficking of teenagers — and how his ties to 
the rich and the powerful seem to have allowed him to avoid prison or a serious jail term for over a decade. The 
article noted that Circuit Judge Luis Delgado's release of approximately 150 pages on Monday came as a surprise 
since there was a scheduled hearing next week over unsealing the graphic testimony. Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed 
a bill in February allowing the release on Monday or any time thereafter that Delgado ordered. Florida grand jury 
transcripts are usually kept secret forever, but the bill created an exemption for cases like Epstein's. The article 
mentioned that the transcripts show that the grand jury heard testimony that Epstein, who was then in his 40s, had 
raped teenage girls as young as 14 at his Palm Beach mansion, often paying them so he could commit statutory 
rape or assault. The teenagers testified and told detectives they were also paid cash or rented cars if they found 
him more girls. Fox News (07/01, Vacchiano, Ruiz), the Times (07/01, Hurley, Pavia), New York Post (07/01, Reyes),

The Karen Read Murder Case Ends in a Mistrial. Prosecutors Say They Will Try Again 
The Associated Press (07/01, Casey) reported that a judge declared a mistrial Monday after jurors deadlocked in 
the polarizing and much-watched case of Karen Read, a woman accused of striking her Boston police officer 
boyfriend with her SUV and leaving him to die in a snowstorm. The article stated that prosecutors say they intend 
to retry the case in which the defense asserted that Read had been framed by police. On the fifth day of 
deliberation, jurors sent Judge Beverly Cannone a note saying they remained at an impasse in the case involving 
the January 2022 death of John O'Keefe. According to the article, Read, a former adjunct professor at Bentley 
College, faced second-degree murder and other charges in the death of O'Keefe, a 16-year member of the Boston 
police who was found outside a Canton home of another Boston police officer. An autopsy found O'Keefe died of 
hypothermia and blunt force trauma. Prosecutors said Read and O'Keefe had been drinking heavily before she 
dropped him off at a party at the home of Brian Albert, a fellow officer. They said she hit him with her SUV before 
driving away. The article noted that the defense sought to portray Read as the victim, saying O'Keefe was actually 
killed inside Albert's home and then dragged outside. They argued that investigators focused on Read because she 
was a "convenient outsider" who saved them from having to consider other suspects, including Albert and other 
law enforcement officers at the party. The Washington Post (07/01, Bellware, Sunman) reported that the defense 
was bolstered by reports from an FBI probe into O'Keefe's death that said his injuries did not appear to be from a 
vehicle strike, and by damaging testimony from Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, a lead 
investigator in the case. The Guardian (07/01, Oladipo), Fox News (07/01, Eberhart), Boston Globe (07/01, Cotter),

MS-13 Gang Member Wanted for Murder in El Salvador Arrested in NYC After Entering U.S. Illegally 
Fox News (07/01, Price) reported that an MS-13 gang member wanted for murder in El Salvador was apprehended 
by New York City U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents after entering the U.S. illegally as a 
gotaway, according to authorities. The article noted that on June 20, NYC-based ICE deportation officers arrested 
27-year-old Melvin Orlando Hernandez Villanueva. According to authorities, Hernandez Villanueva is a Salvadoran 
MS-13 gang member with an Interpol Red Notice for two counts of aggravated homicide in El Salvador. He was 
arrested in Queens and had marijuana and a loaded handgun on him, authorities said. The article mentioned 
that Salvadoran authorities issued an arrest warrant for Hernandez Villanueva on March 28, 2019. On Oct. 12,
