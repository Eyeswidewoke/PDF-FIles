Re: not sure hat happened to my cut and paste 
but here is what i meant to write ,„, 
last convo i had with Nathan was the same day we spoke where he wanted to know if we could do all the fun exciting 
stuff together without him buying Aby out 
i said no because Aby has all the control and influence over our future and 
that for the 6 million we have a clean slate and completely owen NYC and ALL IP and ALL future deals if ANY SORT ...he 
said ok and that we will see each other on the 20th in NYC .... based on ur advice i had my lawyers speak to his team and 
the summary is the following ....from our lawyers ..Hi. Just a quick download from the call Kristina and I had with Nick 
Dykstra from Nathan's family office. The call went fine. Told him about our commitment to structure this so that neither 
Nathan or is trust would be subject to third party liabilities. We also told him we were flexible to accommodate their tax 
issues as to the structure (e.g. their using an LLC). Finally, we discussed what Jennie told us as to her call with Nathan as 
to the problems with leaving the 55th St location and structure "as is" (why this would be problematic going forward). 
He appreciated our comments and said they were helpful. He also mentioned how Daniel had been very helpful .So, 
good stuff.  
LOVE YOU JEFFREY ! Next step is my lunch with Nathan Oct 20th ...can catch up any time ....LOVE U
