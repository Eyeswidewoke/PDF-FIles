questions. 
COUTURIER stated that on the flight back he grew 
increasingly uncomfortable. Although he did not see any of the 
young girls that EPSTEIN was talking about he was not sure if he 
could do this job for him. COUTURIER added that every time he met 
with EPSTEIN he had his assistants there who are all very 
attractive young women and others unknown to him but all appeared 
to be over the age of 18 
EPSTEIN also showed COUTURIER his home on 71th street in 
Manhattan, NY as he wanted him to decorate that place also. 
COUTURIER showed him a massage room where he had photographs 
("artistic renditions' according to COUTURIER) of young women in 
the nude, ranging from age 15 through 20 all hanging from the walls 
of this massage room. COUTURIER did not ask him any questions 
about this room and moved on to the rest of the house. 
COUTURIER then came back to New York and started out 
drawing plans and although he did not have a contract, EPSTEIN did 
give him a check for $50.000.00 as a deposit for his services. 
COUTURIER stated that his plans went back and forth 
between his offices and EPSTEIN'S people but EPSTEIN never seemed 
happy. COUTURIER sent some of his associates back to the USVI to 
take measurements and adjust his plans and EPSTEIN was pleased in 
some aspects but was still highly critical. 
COUTURIER then decided that this was not the right job 
for him. COUTURIER staled that in the back of his mind, he wanted 
to have 'a way out" should he decide that he could not work with 
EPSTEIN which was why he did not have a formal contract signed. 
EPSTEIN was very difficult to work with and COUTURIER found that 
EPSTEIN had not changed his pattem of behavior obviously If he was 
having the home in the USVI decorated for girls to stay with him. 
This did not sit well with COUTURIER. He then wrote EPSTEIN a note 
apologizing for not being able to take on this job. COUTURIER 
stated that he could not just drop everything or any of his 
projects whenever EPSTEIN wanted him at the site (USVI). EPSTEIN 
was very persistent but COUTURIER was firm in his decision. 
In July 2010. EPSTEIN tried to sue him for his deposit 
and he has many attorneys at his disposal who are very aggressive. 
COUTURIERS attorney stated that If they decided to litigate this 
case, it was going to be a long process. COUTURIER decided to 
settle and returned $15.000.00 to EPSTEIN to save himself the 
hassle of litigation. 
COUTURIER stated that EPSTEIN and 
were a couple but 
had broken up. At one point COUTURIER had spoken to 
about her break-up with EPSTEIN. She told him, "I have seen him do 
horrific things' but did not elaborate. 
is still his 
assistant and they are on fnendly terms. COUTURIER stated he 
believed that 
although very pretty, was now too old for
