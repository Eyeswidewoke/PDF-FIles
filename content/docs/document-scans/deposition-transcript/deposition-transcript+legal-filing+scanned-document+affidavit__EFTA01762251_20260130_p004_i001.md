Obama said, "Turkey is going to play an important ro=e as we bring representatives of the regime and opposition 
together in the=coming weeks." He went on: "We both agree that [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad needs to go. He 
needs to transfer=power to a transitional body. That is the only way that we're going to res=lve this crisis. And we're 
going to keep working for a Syria that is free =rom Assad's tyranny; that is intact and inclusive of all ethnic and religious 
groups; and that's a source of=stability, not extremism, because it's in the profound interest of all our=nations, 
especially Turkey." 
In the questions and answers <http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/201405/16/president-obama-and-prime-minister-
erdogan-turkey-hold-press-confer=nce> , Obama explained that "Geneva 2" did not mean reducing support =o the 
opposition by saying: "There's no magic formula for dealing w=th an extraordinarily violent and difficult situation like 
Syria's. If t=ere were, I think the prime minister and I already would have acted on it and it would already be finished. 
And instead, what we ha=e to do is apply steady international pressure, strengthen the opposition.=l do think that the 
prospect of talks in Geneva involving the Russians and=representatives about a serious political transition that all the 
parties can buy into may yield results.=94 These were the words that best explained Obama's position. 
Let's see what Prime Minister Erdogan said: 
"Syria was at the top of our agenda. And we have views =hat overlap, as the president has just said. But let me tell you 
tha= ending this bloody process in Syria and meeting the legitimate demands of the people by establishing a new 
government are =wo areas where we are in full agreement with the United States. To prevent=Syria from becoming an 
area of operations for terror organizations is amon= our priorities." 
In the Q&A, Erdogan outright referred to the Geneva p=ocess. He said: "As I said before, our views do overlap, and with 
our=discussions this evening, we will continue to explore what we can do together, what we can consider as parts of a 
road m=p looking at Geneva and beyond. Russia and China being part of this proces= is very important, and this is 
important in the context of the permanent =embers of the UN Security Council. Their participation in this process will 
certainly add greater impetus.&qu=t; 
It is possible to conclude from Erdogan's remarks that =e is committed to the Geneva process. This also shows that the 
validity of=Ankara's understanding of a military solution is no more. 
Political logic requires us to think that the Americans a=ked Ankara to persuade the opposition groups (that Ankara is 
close contact=with) to engage in the Geneva process. Furthermore, we will have to accept that from now on any military 
assistan=e to the opposition will serve not as a military solution but to keep the =ressure on the regime that has been 
lately gaining militarily in the field= 
It is interesting fthat Erdogan declares that he is "ag=inst terrorist organizations using Syria." Of course, what is 
importa=t here is what Erdogan understands of "terror organizations." Until now, we have not heard him or his 
government say a=word about considering Syria's al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra <http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-
cia-qatar-and-the-creation-of-s=rias-jabhat-al-nusra/S335453> as a terror organization. He probably was referring to 
=he PYD, the PKK's Syrian extension. If so, there is nothing interesting =n what he says. But if he meant Jabhat al-Nusra, 
we will see. 
Another important development was his announcing for the =irst time that he will also be visiting the West Bank 
alongside Gaza in Ju=e. It was known that the Obama administration was not delighted with Erdogan visiting only Gaza. 
It is understood that E=dogan responded favorably to suggestions from the White House. 
The result is: The Ankara government that until yesterday=was pursuing an extremist, illusionary and ideological Syria 
policy as of =ay 16 has come close to a moderate and rational mainstream policies. =/span>
