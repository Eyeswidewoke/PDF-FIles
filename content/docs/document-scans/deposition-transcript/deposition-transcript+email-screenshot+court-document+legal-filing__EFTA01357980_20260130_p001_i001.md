WEST PALM BEACH 
A former Palm Beach Community College student who police say procured underage girls to give Jeffrey Epstein sexual massages at his 
Palm Beach mansion, and Epstein's personal assistant have been sued along with Epstein over their alleged conduct. 
The girl behind the lawsuit was 14 years old when she contends he engaged in sexual conduct with her after she went to his waterfront 
home in 2005 to give him a massage. Her lawsuit, filed under the name Jane Doe. seeks unspecified damages from Epstein for sexual 
assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
She also sued Epstein. 
of Loxahatchee and 
of New York City on grounds of conspiracy and civil racketeering. 
'We just want a full measure of justice for this girl,' said her attorney, Ted Leopold. 
who attended Palm Beach Community College, was paid by Epstein to bring girls to his mansion for massages and more, 
according to Palm Beach police. "I'm like a Heidi Fleiss," they said she told them. Her attorney could not be reached immediately for 
comment 
was an Epstein personal assistant who arranged the encounters, even escorting the girls to his massage room, police alleged. 
"These two conspired with him to help with the criminal enterprise," Leopold said. 
Jane Doe. through her father and stepmother. filed a federal lawsuit against Epstein in January. She dismissed it after her mother said she 
wasn't consulted about the litigation and sought to intervene. The mother is acting on her daughters behalf in the latest lawsuit. 
Epstein's lawyer has denied the girl's allegations and said her family is simply attempting to get money from a very rich man. Epstein, 55, 
is a Manhattan money manager who has homes there, in New Mexico and the Virgin Islands, in addition to his 58.5 million Palm Beach 
mansion. 
Two other Jane Does have sued Epstein in federal court this year, making similar allegations to those of the first Jane Doe. Those cases 
remain active. 
Also pending against Epstein in state court is a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution arising from the same alleged incidents with 
several girls. That case is set for trial in July. two years after he was indicted. 
Jane Doe's new lawsuit filed in Palm Beach County Circuit Court, is the most explicit in detailing Epstein's alleged misconduct. It is the 
only suit to include 
and 
as defendants, and the only one to make conspiracy and racketeering allegations. 
Jane Doe will turn 18 in May She Irves with other family members in Palm Beach County, is nearing graduation from high school and is 
working part time. Leopold said.
