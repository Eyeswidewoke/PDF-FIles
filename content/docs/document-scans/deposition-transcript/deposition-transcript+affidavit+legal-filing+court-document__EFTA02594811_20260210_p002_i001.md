I dealt with relationship management people at GS and JPM and asked them who we should talk to. I 
found myself talking to derivatives and wealth management people. Nice, but not helpful. Would be extremely grateful 
for names.

good news on the sale of the g 5. . 1 I read your memo of aug 30 to leon. . 1 made me laugh, first. 
there is no gs or JPM there are people whose names should always be attached, ( as per our last correspondence ), 
saying that you spoke to jpm and they dont know of a derivative in similar circumstanes , says little to me, who did 
you speak with. ? . what structures did you propose. ? 2 The Clat is an easy one I merely asked you to ask them if 
they have ever seen one of size above say 500m. . I doubt it. . if not . why? . 3. I have yet to hear that there is a 
dialogue with tax planiing with either 16 or 17. . as these are usually weeks long with complex questiohs. I assume 
somoene has been doing that. . 
Separate and aprt from past fees. and their issue of deductibility. . there is both an issue of past fees 
not yet settled and if you guys want my current or future advice. you will need to pay for it. not complicated. and the 
fees will need to be agreed beforehand. . BRH TRA restructure as a small example.. 
"Happy new year if i dont speak to you before
