their government should have been thrown out of office. I mean, every time that a Canadian 
shows up in a uniform, it's doing us a favor? How's that work?" 
Kushner Touts Administration's Mideast Peace Strategy. 
Asked on Politico Playbook (8/27, 4.31M) about the Administration's Mideast peace strategy, 
White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner said, "President Trump has laid out a great vision for 
them," including "a proposal on the table for Palestinian state from Israel," which has "never 
been done before in the history of the negotiation." Kushner added, "We've built a full business 
plan that could take their economy and double their GDP, create a new, million new jobs, and 
reduce their poverty by 50%," adding that "if they show courage and if they're willing to take a 
little bit of risk, I think under this President, he's shown that by doing things in an 
unconventional way, incredible things are possible." 
US, China Trade Jibes As Military Tensions Escalate. 
Reuters (8/27, Blanchard) reports the US and China "traded jibes as military tensions grow" 
between the two nations, with Defense Secretary Esper vowing not to "cede an inch" in the 
Pacific and "China saying Washington was risking soldiers' lives." During talks with US allies in 
Hawaii, Esper said, "To advance the CCP's agenda, the People's Liberation Army continues to 
pursue an aggressive modernisation plan to achieve a world class military by the middle of the 
century." This, he added, "will undoubtedly involve the PLA's provocative behaviour in the South 
and East China Seas, and anywhere else the Chinese government has deemed critical to its 
interests." China's Defense Ministry "shot back," saying "certain U.S. politicians" damaging Sino-
US ties in the run-up to the November election for their own gain. 
The Washington Examiner (8/27, Mahshie, 448K) reports that in Hawaii, Esper "met 
virtually with the chiefs of defense from 29 Pacific nations, and in a public shift, the defense 
secretary has begun to speak of building partnerships with smaller and further dispersed Pacific 
nations." Said Esper, "We are also looking to expand our engagement with new and emerging 
partners throughout South and Southeast Asia. Assisting countries across the region to develop 
their national security policies, strategies, plans, and laws is critical." 
China Fires Missiles Into South China Sea. The New York Times (8/27, Myers, 
Bradsher, 18.61M) reports China on Wednesday "fired a barrage of medium-range missiles 
across considerable distances into the South China Sea, Beijing's latest move to demonstrate its 
strategic dominance and sovereignty over the disputed waters, an American defense official 
said." Senior Col. Wu Qian, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, "did not 
mention the missiles on Thursday but confirmed that China had carried out long-planned drills 
over an area that stretched from Qingdao in northeastern China to disputed islands in the 
South China Sea known as the Spratlys." Col. Wu said, "The above exercises are not directed at 
any country." 
The Washington Times (8/27, Glenn, 492K) reports the Chinese maneuvers drew criticism 
Thursday from the Pentagon, which called them "the latest in a long string of actions to assert 
unlawful maritime claims." 
WPost: China Not Interested In Preserving Online "Freedom." The Washington
Post (8/27, 14.2M) editorializes that when China imposed "a sweeping new national security 
law, onlookers wondered whether President Xi Jinping would impose his digital authoritarianism 
on the island state - or whether some sort of compromise would emerge leaving online life less 
free than before, but still free enough to use the word 'freedom:" Now, the Post says, "we have 
an answer: China is not interested in compromise." Hong Kong, it argues, "is the latest frontier 
in a fight over Internet freedom that is occurring around the world."

The Wall Street Journal (8/27, Simmons, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that Russian 
prosecutors said that they are not planning to investigate the poisoning or illness of Alexei
