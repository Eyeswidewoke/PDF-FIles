16,000 police officers.7 
At the height of the 2011 London riots, which seem to be known as Britainbs "intifada of 
the underclass," one of Prime Minister David Cameronbs former advisors pointed out 
that the rioting youth "have nothing 
to lose and nothing to gain. "8 British rioters believed that their lives were going 
nowhere because they were "further than ever from the sort of wealth that makes them 
adults. A career, a home of your ownbike Minas that can be ruined by notsbare out of 
sight "9 One woman who carried a television out of a store justified her action by 
stating. "Ibm taking my taxes back "10 
According to an editorial in the Financial Times in early August 2011, the government 
"lost control of En9landbs streets. (The unrest] has exploded into an orgy of arson, 
looting and feral violence which has 
spread through the capital and to other English cities. . . The government must now 
do what is necessary to regain control of the nationbs streets."11 Cameron tackled the 
threat of social media, stating during an emergency parliamentary session: "Everyone 
watching these horrific actions will be struck by how they were organized via social 
media." noting the govemmentbs need to "stop people communicating via these Web 
sites and services when we know they are plotting violence, disorder and criminality. . . 
. Free f low of information can be used for good. But it can also be used for ill. And 
when people are using social media for violence, we need to stop them. "12 According 
to Cameron, the British government would not be deterred by "phoney human rights 
concerns. "13 
Beyond such declarations, one mainstream British publication observed that the 
London rioters were able to "terrorize" their own countrymen, and that the government 
considered deploying the British army into the streets.14 
Thus. Saudi Arabiabs security policy on communication including the Internet and 
social media may need to evolve in this direction as well, with contingency plans for 
Saudi military deployment to protect the 
people and in support of the Kingdombs other security and law enforcement 
institutions. At the same time. it is crucial to note that in early 2011, before the protests 
broke out in Israel and Great Britain. the Kingdom announced $35 billion in government 
spending 
for unemployment benefits, housing subsidies, and other social programs. With these 
developments in mind, Saudi policies continue to address economic securityrdbv*mal

appear to be roughly analogous to conclusions reached by Israel and Great Britain. 
Ultimately. Western leaders do not want to see "social media" sources organize large 
protests erupting in Riyadh or downtown Beijing. The serious risk is that Western oil 
traders and other Western financiers 
could get nervous due to miscalculations of risktrus"*°°"`"*sky*cke.band Western 
economies could finally collapse. According to a report, curiously entitled "America 
Fears the Great Brawl of China." there are an "estimated 18.000 riots, strikes 
and protests that break out in China" each year.15 Consider the global economic 
destruction if such unrest were to become much more organized through social media 
or other Internet facilities.16 According to one Western media dispatch on China. "Since 
the 
nationwide student-led protests of 1989. the educated urban elite has mostly been 
politically Quiescent But the party fears them far more than it does unruly farmers or 
migrants. Beijingbs center was flooded with police earlier this year when calls for an 
Arab-style b iasmine revolutionb circulated on the internet "17 
A postscript on developments in Libya makes clear that economic deprivation is at the 
root of instability and may not necessarily alter circumstances by simply changing 
regimes. According to Anthony Cordesman, 
"We need to recognize that Libyabr,ke as only other States that have become increasingly unstable since Of* 20110is
