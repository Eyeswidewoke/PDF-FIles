Gymboree Corp 
Still Waiting For The Turnaround 
knday the 13th came a day uatly with fiscal 3O I:: rusultt; yusturcick: 
We were surprised and disappointed by the dismal results from Gymboree as 
the company took a step backwards on its turnaround effort. With new 
management installed in January 2013, admittedly there was little that could 
be done by them to refine committed designs for the fall and holiday seasons 
but the quarter was also beset by increased promotional activity and a 
fulfillment issue on the e-commerce platform. Modest silver linings on strong 
inventory control and a $25 million bond repurchase were encouraging but not 
nearly enough to turn investor sentiment on the credit. 
We recognize that the competitive environment in children's apparel is very 
challenging but feel that management is on the right path with its inventory 
control and a revised design aesthetic slated for the Spring 2014 season. With 
positive free cash flow and potential for additional bond repurchases, full 
access to the revolver as of the earnings call, no meaningful maturities until 
2018 and attractive yield, we maintain our long-term positive view on the term 
loan and our BUY recommendation on the bonds. 
Getting design light 
We've heard a lot this year from the new management about needing to have 
clearer points of view on design, providing fresh takes on classic looks and 
continuing to stream new flow through the stores while still reducing the SKU 
proliferation but the major disappointment is that very little of these critical 
action items were actually actionable for the fall and holiday seasons. With 
nine month lead times in design the fall season was already done when 
management came on board and holiday was nearly complete as well. 
C1O/1" 8 paie:,e 
The Janie & Jack and Gymboree banners outperformed the company's value 
oriented growth concept Crazy 8 for the quarter, which we believe is a good 
reason to take a pause in the hereto rapid growth of the brand. With 383 
stores at quarter end, the Crazy 8 banner should be the outperforming concept 
in our opinion given the cautious consumer. Our sense from the earnings call 
is that management may scale back its Crazy 8 openings, roughly 85 this year, 
further in 2014, along with cap ex, as it works to get the assortment of basics 
and key items aligned with its target demographic.

The transition to a new 3rd party DC for web fulfillment in the quarter did not 
go smoothly as management was forced to scale back promotions so as to not 
overwhelm the system. 
In addition to missed top-line opportunities, the 
company paid S1 million in additional expenses to remedy customer orders. 
Management noted that it's on-line "Black Friday" promotions were handled 
correctly by the system and that while not yet 100%, they are continuing to 
make progress on this important part of the go to market strategy. 
Rsks 
We remain cautious on competitive pressure, promotional environment, gross 
margin, inventory, input costs, e-commerce platform, capital expenditures, 
store openings, management changes and execution on design.
