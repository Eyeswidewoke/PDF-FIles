sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the 
Russian economy, but also could be disruptive to the global 
economy." 
Russian stocks traded in New York fell the most in more 
than two weeks after obama's announcement. The Bloomberg Russia-
u.s. Equity index of the most-traded Russian shares in the U.S. 
dropped 3.3 percent to 80.10 at 4 p.m. in New York. 
standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Russia to negative 
because of the risks posed by the conflict, affirming Russia's 
credit rated at BBB, the second-lowest investment grade. 
Russia's Reaction 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was surprised 
by some of the names on today's list, and considers the use of 
sanctions unacceptable. It's not true that Putin is an investor 
in Gunvor as the u.s. alleges, he said. 
In retaliation for the new u.s. sanctions, the Russian 
government barred entry of nine u.s. officials, including House 
Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee Chairman Robert menendez of New Jersey. 
"The speaker is proud to be included on a list of those 
willing to stand against Putin's aggression," Boehner's 
spokesman, Michael steel, said in an e-mail. 
Edward J. Krauland, a partner at the law firm Steptoe & 
Johnson who's a specialist on international sanctions, said 
targeting individuals probably won't have a big an impact on 
Russia's actions. Hitting Russian economic sectors would. 
"I don't even think if they targeted Putin it would bring 
Mr. Putin to the table," Krauland said. "If you can isolate 
particular sectors of a country's economy that are significant, 
disproportionate parts of the economy, you're going to impose a 
hurt on that country." 
EU Debate 
The Eu, with closer economic ties to Russia, hasn't gone as 
far as the u.S. The 28-nation bloc saddled 21 Russian and 
Crimean officials with asset freezes and visa bans on March 17, 
and may widen that list to include close Putin associates at a 
summit in Brussels today and tomorrow. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Russia's biggest EU 
trading partner, said it's too early to start economic 
retaliation. "we will make very clear that in the case of 
further escalation we will be ready to introduce economic 
sanctions," Merkel told reporters before the EU summit. 
sanctions require the agreement of all EU governments, a 
consensus-building process that can't match Putin's speed in 
mobilizing troops in Crimea, staging the secession referendum 
and moving toward annexation. 
Ukraine Tensions 
Tensions continue to rise in the region. The government in 
Kiev said yesterday it plans to reinforce its eastern border 
with Russia and withdraw troops from Crimea, ceding control of 
the Black sea peninsula. obama said Russia's continuing military 
movements carry "dangerous risks of escalation." 
u.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Nagel spoke by phone today 
with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to clarify Russia's 
intentions for its troops amassed along the border with Ukraine, 
Rear Admiral John Kirby, Hagel's spokesman, said at a news 
conference. 
Shoigu told Hagel that Russian troops are arrayed along the 
border only for military exercises, Kirby said. Russian troops 
won't cross the border into Ukraine and "would take no 
aggressive action," Kirby said Hagel was told. 
"It was a lengthy call, lasting about an hour, and I think 
it's fair to say that at times it was direct," Kirby said of 
the exchange.
