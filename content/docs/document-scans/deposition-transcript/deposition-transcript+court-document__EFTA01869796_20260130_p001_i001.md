Jeffrey Epstein's loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously lenient. They 
insist that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and essentially harmless. As the 
police records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could "set no" at an time

in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that 
MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein's private jets. 
It's true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily several 
times—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of the contact, 
particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this case—judging by 
arrangements at the Palm Beach house—is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organized his life 
around 
compulsion in an open and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law.

soap in the shape of sex organs, and various sex toys, such as a "twin torpedo- vibrator and creams and

not be charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their 
other duties, worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily "massages" was stocked with 
fresh recruits. Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who 
was for many years Epstein's live-in partner, also recruited young girls. 
Since his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen 
lawsuits brought b undera e irls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled 
trial: 
n amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.
The victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often 
gave them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named 
Lupita, who was a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage 
sessions, picking up soiled towels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with 
the pope hung next to one of him with a young girl.
