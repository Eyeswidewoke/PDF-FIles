Following the drawings, the interviewers showed a modest increase in detection accuracy for the false 
stories only, but the overall discrimination of true from false stories now was statistically reliable (p < . 
05). The drawing task improved the detection of deception by revealing some time-consuming difficulties 
(see Table 2) on the part of deceptive subjects. During the debriefing session at the conclusion of the 
study, the interviewers reported unanimously that the subjects whom they thought were being deceptive 
failed to include significant elements from their narratives in their drawings whereas truthful subjects 
tended to add a few new details in their drawings. Deceptive subjects frequently needed to start over with 
their drawings due to inconsistencies, and they tended to change and/or correct elements of their stories. 
Overall then, deceptive subjects required more time to complete their illustrations even though it was the 
truthful subjects who tended to add some new details during this stage. 
Following the follow-up questioning, the discrimination of the true from false stories improved fur-
ther through modest increases in detection accuracy for both true and false stories (p < .05). As predicted 
from past research, the follow-up questioning for the true stories was significantly longer than the follow-
up questioning for the false stories (see Table 2). 
Following the use of the reverse-order technique, detection accuracy improved substantially for both 
the true and false stories (p < .01). Thus, asking for the narrative in reverse order had significant diagnos-
tic value beyond simply asking follow-up questions. Requiring the subject to tell the story backward im-
proved the detection of deception by revealing time-consuming difficulties (see Table 2) on the part of 
deceptive subjects. During the debriefing session at the conclusion of the study, the interviewers reported 
that the subjects whom they thought were being deceptive tended to require prompts to keep them from 
making significant leaps backward in time and reverting to forward-order recall ("What happened right 
before that?"). 
Following the challenge stage, maximum discrimination accuracy was observed for both true and 
false stories, but the additional gain was achieved through greater accuracy for true stories only (p < .05). 
This is because, by the time of the challenge stage, most interviewers already had decided that most of the 
deceptive subjects were in fact deceptive (see Table 1). During the debriefing session at the conclusion of 
the study, all six interviewers agreed on the following differences between the subjects whom they be-
lieved to be truthful and the subjects they believed to be deceptive: When asked to clarify unresolved in-
consistencies in their stories, truthful subjects most often offered explanations that involved miscommu-
nication ("I wasn't clear before, let me explain...") whereas deceptive subjects most often offered expla-
nations that involved claims of faulty memory ("I was mistaken before, it was this way..."). When asked 
if the subjects wanted to add anything, deceptive subjects tended to either say "No" quickly or they sim-
