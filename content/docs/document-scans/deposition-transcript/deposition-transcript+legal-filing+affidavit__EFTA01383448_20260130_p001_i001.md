' Noncovered under the cost basis rules as defined below. 
Generally, securities acquired before 2011, in retirement accounts or held by Non-U.S. entities are not subject to the cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and are marked as "noncovered". Securities marked as "covered", were identified as securities potentially subject to the cost 
basis reporting rules and may be reported to the IRS on form 1099-B for the applicable tax year in which the securities are disposed 
Note: In the event where we cannot easily determine the taxability of an account, we may mark the account as noncovered. However, if the account does not receive a 10998, the cost basis 
will not be reported to the IRS. 
This Schedule may not reflect all cost basis adjustments necessary for tax reporting purposes, especially for noncovered securities. Adjustments to cost basis may have been made for prior 
income received and subsequently reclassified by the issuer as a return of capital. In addition, corporate action events may require adjustments to your original cost basis. Return of capital 
information and cost basis information, as it relates to corporate actions, has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. 
Adjustments to cost basis can be made after year-end, in particular, for return of capital adjustments, but may also include adjustments for corporate action events. Therefore there may be 
differences in cost basis reflected on your monthly client brokerage statement at year end versus any subsequent reports, including your 1099-8 or online displays you may have available to 
you. 
W hen you report your cost basis on your tax return, it should be verified using all of your own records. In particular, there may be other adjustments which you need to make, but are not 
required to be made by Pershing as it relates to H.R. 1424. You should consult with your tax advisor in order to properly report your gain or loss for tax purposes. Pershing shall not be 
responsible for and makes no representations or warranties with respect to the accuracy of any information that you report to the IRS or other taxing authorities, and, accordingly, disclaims 
any and all liability that may arise with respect to your use and reliance on the information provided herein for such reporting. 
Please refer to the Your Account Information Section in your brokerage account statement for your account's existing tax-lot disposition method. The disposition method is the method which 
you have selected to use in the disposal of each tax lot of the securities held in your account. If you do not select a method, your account will be defaulted to First In, First Out (FIFO). Your 
account's selected tax lot method will be used to determine the cost basis for calculating gain and/ or loss, unless another method was selected at the time of the security disposal, and this may 
be reported on the IRS Form 1099-B. 
M essages 
Please note the following information for Pershing's 2018 IRS Form 1099 (B, DIV, INT, M ISC and 0lD): Your Form 1099 will be delivered as early as possible, beginning January 31, 
2019. By February 15, you will be mailed either your Form 1099 or a special Pending 1099 Notice. The Pending 1099 Notice will be sent if we have not received and processed final 
information from issuers and trustees of securities that you hold by the as of date of the February 15 1099 mailing. You will also be sent the notice if your information is still being 
reviewed and finalized. The notice will inform you of the securities that are pending final reporting and provides the anticipated mail date of your 199. Your 199 will be mailed no 
later than M arch 15, 201. 
Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual fund. Shares 
of a money market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds credited to your brokerage 
account. Please see the money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional information. Pursuant to SEC 
Rule 10b-10(b)(1) confirmations are not sent for purchases into money market mutual funds processed on the sweep platform.
