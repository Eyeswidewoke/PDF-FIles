JE states that the fwd cabin monitor is bad. He states that in turbulence the monitor picture distorts / blinking. 
He states that the monitor is Plasma. Monitor is in fact LCD — verified this morning. Larry / JE. please 
expand on this discrepancy..... 
Fwd Monitor blinks, Blue colors especially while in Airshow mode, the slightest turbulence causes colors to 
blink darker then lighter. Monitor 'appears" to be a Plasma type,. if you touch the screen with your finger, the 
colors darken,. the DU885 screens in the cockpit are LCD, they do not change color when you touch the 
screen. 
Entertainment System -
Upon turning on the system, there is a whining sound (NO — it's not Larry!) — what channel was it on (apple tv 
or dvd selected?) 
Questioning how we wired the system — something to the effect of AMP — sub out? 
Getting low end bass coming through the psu mid range tweeters, so maybe a problem with the cross overs? 
Jay & Dan, please comment on this as it relates to our discussion this morning about Apple TV and Blue 
Tooth for listening to music. 
-Entertainment System: 
—Hissing noise / interference static is heard in speakers, the noise goes away when you select speakers to 
"OFF", Need to investigate what Power Buss your are utilizing to obtain Power for the amps? 
"'Please explain why we are not using the SUB OUT control on receiver again? there is Low 
frequency/BASS heard in PSU speakers. 
***Battery back still does not work. Settings are lost during power down of aircraft. 
Air Gaspers -
There are approximately six (6) air gaspers in the cabin that do not seat 100%, therefore at altitude, the 
pressure causes a very annoying 'hissing sound' as the pressurized air leaks" out. These units will most 
likely have to go back to be stripped and replated then tested 100% on their benches AND ours with proper 
air pressure to insure they are closing air tight prior to reinstallation. JE will mark the air gaspers that are 
leaking on his next flight. 
-Air Gaspers leaking- ALL cabin Gaspers do not seal completely, Hissing noise is heard when fully closing 
any cabin gasper,. (Especially the R/H gasper above aft facing Conference seat. (We invested $57,970 for 
plating, I hope the company you used will step up and offer a solution or replace of gaspers that seal properly 
The fwd gasper over the divan/bed is too far fwd and blows on the back of the passengers head. Need to 
relocate the gasper aft to direct air "in front of the passenger — not the back of his head). 
12/H #2 VIP Master Switch Panel-
When the aircraft comes back, send the master panel out to MCC to have it reprogrammed to control the 
shades "ALL UP" and 'ALL DOWN'. Larry please contact MCC and see what their scheduling is like and 
discuss with Jay so that we are all on the same page. 
VIP master switch panel - last week I contacted the same person Jay spoke to, work in progress. 3 week min 
lead time for software engineering.
