we are and who the enemy is. Pr=jection and introjection are active almost across the board. It is always =elpful, for 
instance, to ask how what the enemy accuses us of is more appr=priately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt 
and Shame, our need =o be liked, and other psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasi=s. 
As these narratives ("Our courts will =ever allow that," "As a superpower we will always be able =o win 
any fight we put our minds to," "Assimilation will e=sure Muslims are westernized" ...) gain consent from others =hey 
tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately= what emerges is a relationship we take with 
our Islamic Enemy that parall=ls that between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this relationship =s the "transfer 
of responsibility" in which we assume resp=nsibility for the enemy's behavior who is addicted to transferring=it away 
from itself. The Control Factor actively maintains this =elationship and makes changing that relationship as difficult a 
chore as a=y addict finds in breaking his addiction. And just as an addict needs to d=vote serious effort and con 
sciousness to his addiction, so must we devote great energy to understanding how the Control Factor ultimately 
sabotages us. 
FP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk =bout the three levels of jihad against 
us. What are they? 
Siegel: Simply stated, our Islamic Enemy seeks the totalitarian d=mination of Islam throughout the world 
— Islamic supremacy. It see=s to have the West submit to Islam. Obviously, this does not mean that eve=ybody becomes 
a Muslim. Islam, in all its varied expressions, permits dhim=is- those Christians, Jews, and some others who are 
permitted to remain as=protected non-Muslims as long as they submit to an inferior status. What i= critical is that 
Shariah (Islamic Law) ultimately rules the world. 
Jihad, loosely, is the effort/struggle to see this vision through. The m=st obvious method of Jihad is 
through violence; it is the one most familia= to most Westerners and almost all of the Koranic references to Jihad are 
based in violence. The Violent Jihad includes al-Qaeda an= its offshoots as well as other groups that formed around the 
globe indepe=dent of al-Qaeda. It also obviously includes the violence from Islamic nat=ons such as the Islamic Republic 
of Iran whose constitution specifies such=vision. It also includes, however, various militant groups and training ca=ps 
here in the US as well as ad hoc efforts of individuals.<=p> 
Since 9/11, there have been something in excess of 15,000 Violent Jihadi= attacks across the globe. 
However, as terrible as this is, we have a tend=ncy in the West to think that the only dimension of threat we face comes 
f=om violence. While the Bush administration helped initiate this think=ng, the Obama administration has actively 
abused it by limiting any discus=ion of the threat we face to al-Qaeda and some other terrorist groups=abroad. As 
frightening as these groups are, we can get some ease from thin=ing they are a band of "extremists limited in number, 
weaponry, sophisticati on, and means. Stunningly, Hillary Clinton recently estimated that there ar= only about 50,000 
"homicidal" violent extremists around t=e world who simply have been able to project power much greater than 
their=number should allow. Here the Control Factor makes the threat appear more =asily manageable. 
Jihad, however, is pursued in other often even more effective ways =hich I have grouped into three 
"levels." A second more ins=dious level of threat is what the Muslim Brotherhood itself called the =80 Civilization 
Jihad." It is the effort to infiltrate all aspec=s of our society, peacefully according to our laws, in order to later be i= 
position to sabotage and destroy it from the inside. The Civilization Jih=dists have learned the culture and rules of the 
territories they seek to c=mmand and use those rules to maneuver—specifically using our freed=ms to destroy our 
freedoms. They use "lawfare" to seek changes in our laws so as to push Shariah into our society. Your read=rs should 
read Daniel Pipes and Brooke Goldstein's Lawfare Project=material and others to fully appreciate how cancerous this 
activity has be=ome. This includes intimidating in a variety of ways anyone who speaks out=against them or Islam and 
seeking to squelch our treasured broad right to =ree speech so as to ultimately prevent any criticisms of Islam. Once 
criti=ism of Islam is prohibited, little can stop it from cascading throughout t=e culture. 
The Civilization Jihad includes situating such Jihadists in critical pos=tions in the society, in the 
government, in the legal system, the military= and elsewhere. It includes the control over university programs that
