Jeff, first I would be happy to go over and get all the things that you want done, it's not a big 
deal and I think I can do it in a very efficient manner. You have some good people over there 
that need some direction. But I need to ask some questions first; 
• What is the scope of the work you want completed now. They are talking about 
roads, walls, permanent engineering facilities, etc. 
• I need access to all staffing guides that have been prepared. 
• Are there any budgetary guidelines in place. 
• Who is going to stay on the Island when the project is completed ( will it be Brice and 
his wife). 
• Do we have contracts for your HVAC and mechanical plants? 
You may not know all these answers, but as long as everyone knows that is what I need to 
know when I go down there I will be fine. I was introduced to you by an friend and 
representative of Tom Pritzger, of which both I have the highest esteem for, but you must 
understand I am presently gainfully employed and at the present had no intention of leaving my 
present position, unless something drastically changed the direction that I am going in. With 
that being said I will make arrangements with Cecile to go to the Island next Friday and 
Saturday and sort through everything. I will probably bring two professionals (landscaping and 
engineering with me) to look at the project while I work with your team to get you the 
answers you are looking for. The professionals will be free because everyone in Puerto Rico is 
looking for work and all I am looking to get from them is an appraisal of what needs to be 
done to get this job done and run efficiently going forward. 
For me to make it simple I would charge $225 an hour (that's what I pay my accountant) plus 
a plan ticket from San Juan to Saint Thomas, and if you could put me up at the house it would 
be great. Also my son is a Junior at Brandeis University studying international finance and 
if you would consider him interning a couple of weeks at Christmas with your group that 
would be appreciated. 
If this all works for you I will call Cecile this afternoon and make the appropriate 
arrangements. Also keep in mind I am not a builder, but I have opened numerous hotel 
properties in the Isalnds and know whom to reach out to for help. 
Warm regards, 
Rich
