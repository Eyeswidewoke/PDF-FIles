Secondly, = don't understand them. How could the Cape and Lexington homes =und the Trust? Did the 
funds from selling the Lexington house go =o the Trust? How was it funded before. Would appreciate =larification on 
this. 
Of =ourse we knew by then that she would predecease me. It was a =edical miracle that she was able to 
survive that long, on experimental =rugs, as a last =esort. 
The records that I have seen do not =ndicate what your expectations (or Carol's) were as to how the 
=arital Trusts were to be made available to you after Carol was gone 40=93 for that the independent trustee of the trusts 
(whether me or my =uccessor) has to rely on the terms of the trusts themselves, the information that's given by the 
trust =eneficiaries, and the law surrounding such =rusts. 
=/div> 
I'd be interested, of =ourse, in knowing about the records you have seen, but it would hardly =e 
surprising if there is no explicit record of what is obvious simply =o common sense. We were a married couple who 
cared for each other =nd for our children, putting a Trust in Carol's name for tax =urposes. What sort of lunacy would it 
to set up a Trust for one =f us to have access to but not the other? So of course you are =nlikely to find notes about it. If 
Harry forces this to =itigation, all of this will have to come up, either in court or in =ublic in some other manner. 
<=div> 
When I appointed Harry to replace me as =rustee, I took for granted that he would handle the trust as I 
=ad. His behavior since, and this latest proposal, make it very =tear how wrong that assumption was. This proposal calls 
for him to be =n complete charge, which means, as he has shown, that I can only plead =or some funds by accepting 
conditions that he knows I will not =ccept. You recall, I presume, that this was true even when I faced an enormous tax 
bill because my IRA was being depleted for =he benefit of the family. 
To refresh your memory, let me repeat =gain what was happening with my IRA until I learned about it. 
=here is a mandatory withdrawal. Half was being distributed to =amily. The other half was being used for taxes and 
management fees for the =ntire estate. In order to payMnedical expenses, and to pay =50,000 a year for rent and 
upkeep on the house in Wellfleet that we had =iven to the children and that I was barely using, I had to withdraw extra 
funds from the IRA, with the onerous tax =urden. The same when I withdrew something to live on. Under =hese 
circumstances, Harry refused to release funds from the Trust for =ax relief without onerous and humiliating conditions 
that he knew I would not accept. Easy to predict what might happen =nder less extreme conditions. It was not until 
2017 that I was =ble to overcome the accumulated burden of these actions. 
=/span> 
In the previous paragraph you offer to "refresh=my memory" and in the prior paragraph you say "You 
=ecall, I presume 
". Without going into detail, = have to note that my recollection of the events you describe is not 
consistent with yours (though it may not be =ntirely consistent with Harry's either — I am not =ure). 
In =y case it is not recollections. When I began to understand what =as happening, I looked into the 
matter, and have the documents at hand, =ncluding the mail interchanges about Harry's refusal. The rest is 
=traightforward and unambiguous documents. 
adiv> 
Since my own recollections may be the subject =f testimony in the legal proceeding that Harry has 
initiated, or in one =hat you may commence, I think it better that I not recite my own recollections =ere.
