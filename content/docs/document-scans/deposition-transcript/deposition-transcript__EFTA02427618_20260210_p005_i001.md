superseding indictments. 
The following is a list of the dates and number of counts of the superseding indictments: 
First Indictment November 13, 2008 3 Counts Second Superseding Indictment November 20, 2008 
12 Counts Third Superseding Indictment December 11. 2008 13 Counts Fourth Superseding 
Indictment January 15, 2009 97 Counts Fifth Superseding Indictment March 31, 2009 79 Counts 
Sixth Superseding Indictment May 14, 2009 142 Counts Seventh Superseding Indictment July 16, 
2009 163 Counts 
The basic charges of immigration-law violations and bank fraud remained the same 
throughout this entire series of indictments. In the Third Superseding Indictment the prosecutors 
added the request that the entire Agri business be forfeited to the United States. That demand - for 
the forfeiture of an entire business because some of its employees were illegal immigrants - was not 
made in any other case involving violation of the immigration laws. 
The Fourth Superseding Indictment added the allegation under 7 U.S.C. § 195 that 
Rubashkin had failed to make prompt payments to cattle owners in violation of an Agriculture 
Department regulation because his payments were, on occasion, several days late. This was the 
first time in the history of federal law enforcement that such a criminal charge has ever been made. 
The number of charges was increased by the Iowa prosecutors not because any new 
offenses were discovered. Rather, the basic bank fraud allegation was multiplied because each of 
the bank's advances of funds to Agri under the $35 million line of credit and each month's report to 
the bank by Agri was charged as a separate offense. Money laundering was also alleged to have 
been committed when Rubashkin deposited some funds received from customers to the accounts of 
a local kosher grocery store and religious school that Agri was maintaining in Postville. 
The effect of this deliberate fragmentation of charges was that Rubashkin was ultimately 
tried before a jury not on one basic charge of submitting false reports to the bank regarding the 
security for the bank's loan, but on 91 counts of bank fraud, money laundering, and failure to pay 
cattle dealers. The jury found him guilty on 86 counts. 
5. Why Did Prosecutors Bring in Immigration-Law Violations at the Bank-Fraud Trial 
Recognizing that the jury would be prejudiced against Rubashkin in considering the bank-
fraud allegations if it heard evidence regarding immigration-law violations, the District Judge 
severed the trial of the 72 immigration violations in the Seventh Superseding Indictment from the 91 
bank-fraud charges. Nonetheless, contending that he committed bank fraud when he represented to 
the bank that Agri was complying with the law, the Iowa prosecutors presented more than two days 
of highly inflammatory testimony regarding the immigration allegations during the bank-fraud trial. 
The District Judge denied repeated defense requests for a mistrial. 
6. Why Was Rubashkin Denied Release on Bail Pending Sentencing? 
During the almost ten months between his pretrial release (after 76 days in prison), 
Rubashkin complied punctiliously with all the bail conditions. His probation officer even testified that 
on one occasion, when his electronic ankle bracelet became dislodged, "he alerted her immediately 
to allow for its expedient repair." The District Judge found "that Defendant took great pains to 
comply with the terms of his pretrial release." 
Nonetheless, when the jury retumed a guilty verdict, Rubashkin was immediately remanded 
to prison. In a hearing on the Iowa prosecutors' request that he be denied release pending 
sentencing, the defense offered to post as security approximately $8 million in the equity of 43 
supporters of Mr. Rubashkin and to pay for a 24-hour armed guard that would prevent him from 
leaving his home without prior authorization. The District Judge granted the Iowa prosecutors' 
request, and Rubashkin has now been in the Linn County Jail for more than 130 days, in addition to 
the 76 days he spent in prison between November 2008 and January 2009. 
The law regarding release pending sentencing (the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. § 
3143(a)) does not authorize the pre-sentencing imprisonment of a defendant who is not a danger to 
the community if he is not a "flight risk" and his future presence can be assured by any conditions of 
release. The District Judge stated no reason for imprisoning him other than her unsupported 
concluding statement that he is a "flight risk." The Court of Appeals denied bail also without stating
