him. A specific suggestion was put to him that on 22nd September he sent a text to the prosecutors saying "I 
have not talked to my client since I talked to you". He checked his mobile phone and at first said he did not 
have the message as he does not keep them that far back. He was encouraged to check his inbox, and there was 
an adjournment for that purpose. He then confirmed that on 22nd September 2010 at 16.46 he has a message 
from Ms Ny saying: "Hello — it is possible to have an interview Tuesday". Next there was a message saying: 
"Thanks for letting me know. We will pursue Tuesday 28'h at 1700". He then accepted that there must have 
been a text from him. "You can interpret these text messages as saying that we had a phone call, but I can't say 
if it was on 21" or 22nd". He conceded that it is possible that Ms Ny told him on the 21" that she wanted to 
interview his client. She requested a date as soon as possible. He agrees that the following day, 22nd, she 
contacted him at least twice. 
Then he was then cross-examined about his attempts to contact his client. To have the full flavour it may be 
necessary to consider the transcript in full. In summary the lawyer was unable to tell me what attempts he made 
to contact his client, and whether he definitely left a message. It was put that he had a professional duty to tell 
his client of the risk of detention. He did not appear to accept that the risk was substantial or the need to 
contact his client was urgent. He said "I don't think I left a message warning him" (about the possibility of 
arrest). He referred to receiving a text from Ms Ny at 09.11 on 27th September, the day his client left Sweden. 
He had earlier said he had seen a baggage ticket that Mr Assange had taken a plane that day, but was unable to 
help me with the time of the flight. 
Mr Hurtig was asked why he told Brita Sundberg-Wietman that Ms Ny had made no effort to interview his 
client. He denied saying that and said he has never met her. He agrees that he gave information to Mr Alhem. 
He agrees that where he had said in his statement (paragraph 51) that "I found it astonishing that Ms Ny, having 
allowed five weeks to elapse before she sought out interview", then that is wrong. He had forgotten the 
messages referred to above. They must have slipped his mind. There were then questions about DNA. It was 
suggested to him that a reason for the interrogation taking place in Swcdcn was that a DNA sample may be 
required. He seemed to me to at first agree and then prevaricate. He then accepted that in his submissions to 
the Swedish court he had said that the absence of DNA is a weakness in the prosecution case. He added "I can't 
say if I told Ms Ny that Julian Assange had no intention of coming back to Sweden". He agrees that at least at 
first he was giving the impression that Mr Assange was willing to come back. He was asked if Julian Assangc 
went back to Sweden and replied: "Not as far as I am aware". 
In re-examination he confirmed that he did not know Mr Assange was leaving Sweden on 27th September and 
first learned he was abroad on 29th. He agreed that the mistakes he had made in his proof were embarrassing 
and that shouldn't have happened. He also agreed that it is important that what he says is right and important 
for his client that his evidence is credible.
