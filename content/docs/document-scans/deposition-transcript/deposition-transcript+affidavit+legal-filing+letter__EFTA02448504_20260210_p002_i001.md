From day ze=o a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction=20 just completed . though this 
amount was already sub=tantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was never tol= that this was out of 
range. in fact, alternative methods of paymen= . plane -in-kind etc, were discussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of 
=AO fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a detailed =C2 step by step execution plan and reviewed all 
documents that i was given acce=s to. ( Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in order to make my=many corrections . I was 
then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount . Even in the best of l=ght , though it is beyond question that 
not one-,not -one time in th=ee years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common 
idea,) and =ets say he made a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a 
large amount unless they w=re wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the=deal was known . It had 
both sent in writing and spoken about =n the phone numerous times , a detailed execution plan was provided . =A0 
then and only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after = number of conversations with brad karp 
that only 20m would be paid , (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I feel It 
was rema=kably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? =AO I called him and he said he was never 
told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to sen= him this 
email, with your consent of course. If the transactio=s were never consummated , i would not be owed a dime, 
however , the price=20 was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and=20 overseen by me, the 
price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily discounted, out of friendship, 
=AO from our agreement . I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly left me felling quite uneasy= 
since you asked since la=t nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens drawer.. 
went through cash flows for phaidon shwoing that john murph= is not an accountant. redid your gagosian contract , . 
=AO organized structure in case of divorce. set up gift trust. stopped ada from including multiple times things not in your 
interest. dealt wit= bad sales tax use tax income tax . created 8 millino in deductions=C2 ,500k in mistakes , found 
bank of scotland fbar problems, .. reorg bad art purchases, funds taken„ charibale decustions , helped with fincnacrl 
sttment gamoing commions fling.. boat deductions, rescued stock from grats. . may 1 after months of brad not finding 
anyone i =ent an email saying you would have to pay more.. on april 15. I sent =n email detailing payments owed if i 
could figure out the basis issue, =C2 please see attached, . 
questions you might ask your team=C2 ask them to provide a balance sheet or p&I for REgan=arts. . doesnt exist 
ask . either wechsler or haperin to tell you what brh is, or how the tra=20 works. . . ? as bronstein to tell you why the 
proposed phaidon=20 transaction DOES not work. . as them to give you a plan for the=plane. ? ask them to show you 
the cash mgmt for over 100 million doll=rs. . ask them to show you the IT system progress after one year.. the=20 
approval process for payables. . the cash flow projections? assumptions? ask for a comparative review of investments. 
ask h=perin to describle to you in any detail BRH , the major asset of his two biggest clients. tax basis, disposiotion in 
the estate.. etc. ask br=d to show you the liquidation of the inteveing art space cos? . 
Last year you asked , for my help I told you I preferred not =s we would be better off having no financial intereactions. 
the risk was n=t worth it. You told me that as my friend i had to do it =AO I agreed., here we are in what I find to be 
an awkward situation. t=e transactions that i decvised were used , our agreement was ignored. a=d im not sure how 
to respond.
