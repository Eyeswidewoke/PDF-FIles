Re: 
Very sorry, it has been a "busy" week. Depo went 
hmmm, do depos ever go "well"? 
Bottom line, I seemed to do a very good job of pissing them off, since I repeatedly asked them questions they had to 
answer, which no Lawyer wants to be answering questions in THEIR depo of another person. 
Every time they would tell me to just answer the question I would point out their question could be read several ways 
(such as the sentence "to serve man"). So they were caught in a tricky situation since if they did not answer me the 
Depo could be used against them (and it will) to make them out to be the assholes they are. 
I also would have the stenographer read back things the lawyer had said, after pointing out he had said the wrong thing 
(or even asked the wrong thing). This REALLY pissed him off. But the record stands (I happen to love being recorded, it 
is one of the rare times I can prove my self so quickly). 
I was tag teamed Depoed, and what was interesting was they both acknowledged, begrudgingly, although on their own, 
that I was clearly being honest with them, and actually trying to help. Did I mention 
these guys are assholes? They spent the whole day depoing me, 
learned NOTHING, and anything they really wanted to know I could have emailed them. But, hey, they got paid, and I 
paid for the pleasure of their company. 
While in South Florida I had a very interesting meeting with a local 
http://www. hankasher.com/Hank_Asher_Wi kipedia. htm I 
He has access to a lot of data power. He did a back ground check of me in front of me, and seemed sufficiently 
impressed with what he saw. 
The meeting turned into an all day and night thing. He made me a job offer several times. Not sure I want to work for 
him, but I do like what he is doing, and planning on doing. He used to run drugs (he is a pilot), which is where some of 
his early money came from. He is honest about it, which is cool. 
One of my friends flew me on his plane down the Keys. Uh, er, I don't understand the attraction of the Keys, but 
perhaps I will when I'm 95, and have no urge to live any more. Maybe I'm jaded by Maui. 
Not that we talked about what I actually spend my time doing, but on that front I had a great week. I'm working on a 
new tool for Lawyers and working on a large deal with Thompson Reuters (well, large for me, not for you), and they 
"get" what I'm planning, and are starting to get excited about it. There are 1.2 million lawyers in America, I look forward 
to every fucking one of them paying me monthly. LOL 
I'm back in LA right now for a week or so. I have been asked to do another N show (I have no idea what is up with this, I 
feel like there is someone pulling a practical joke on me). So I'm going to shoot a little test for them in the next few days 
(second one they asked for).
