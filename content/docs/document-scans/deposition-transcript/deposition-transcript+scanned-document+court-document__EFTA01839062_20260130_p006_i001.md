dressed man then returned to the sidewalk and continued speaking and gesturing to the doorman, 
who then walked down 441h street (out of the range of the CCTV camera) then ran back with 
DSK's cab. Perhaps a coincidence, but just 4 seconds after DSK entered the hotel at 7:10:23 PM, 
the well-dressed man appeared from the entrance way, where he had been standing, and followed 
DSK's path to the lobby lounge, where he stopped at a doorway looking towards the reception 
desk. At 7:11 PM, while DSK provided his passport to the reception clerk, the well-dressed 
man can be seen framed in the lounge doorway looking towards him. When at 7:12:16 PM, 
DSK, accompanied by the reception clerk, walked to the elevator lobby. Three seconds later, the 
well-dressed man came out of the doorway, walked past the reception desk , again following 
DSK's route, and, as he passed the elevator lobby, he turned his head to the right towards where 
DSK would be waiting for the elevator. 
The well-dressed man is Brian Yearwood, the head of engineering at the Sofitel. (According to 
the Internet site Linkedin is the hotel's "Director of Engineering Design.") He is a large, muscular 
former prison guard, who had been employed by the Sofitel since 2005. Before that he had 
worked as a corrections officer at the Mid Orange Correction Center in Warwick, New York for 
17 years. According to Solitel records, he was supposed to be off that weekend, but his schedule 
had apparently been changed since his car can be seen on 45"' street all night on the CCTV 
camera. On the film, shortly before DSK goes anywhere, Yearwood seems to appear, and as soon 
as DSK leaves, he seems to follow the same route. These near encounters with DSK, which 
would continue the next day, may have been pure coincidence. Or he may have been assigned by 
the hotel the task of making sure that DSK's arrival— and his departure the next day-- went 
smoothly. Such as task could be a perfectly proper precaution since DSK, a possible future 
president of France, was one of the hotel's most important clients. But if he was assigned that 
role, how did he, or the person on the telephone, know DSK's cab was arriving? (I requested an 
interview with Yearwood, but he, like all other Sofitel employees I approached, declined to speak 
to me.) DSK does not recall ever noticing Yearwood. 
Later that evening DSK went out for dinner, and did not return to the hotel until 1:53 AM, 
according to the key records. He had a guest with him, a blond female. She is shown exiting the 
elevator on the ground floor at 3:56 AM, ending a long day for the 62 year old managing director 
of the IMF . 
SATURDAY MAY 14 
Chapter II 
The Encounter 
May 14, 2011, was a horrendous day for Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Waking up in the 
presidential suite of the Sofitel New York hotel that morning, he could not have known that by 
late afternoon he would, instead of flying to Paris, be imprisoned in New York on a charge of 
sexual assault. He would then be indicted by a grand jury on seven criminal counts, including 
attempted rape, sexual assault, and unlawful imprisonment, spend two nights in the Rikers Island 
jail, placed under house arrest for over a month, and, two weeks before all the charges were 
dismissed by the prosecutor on August 23,2011, sued for sexual abuse by the alleged victim. 
The day began normal enough. The room service waiter knocked on the door of the four 
room suite shortly after 9:30 AM and brought the breakfast he had ordered to the dining room on
