J.P. Morgan 
Global Asset Allocation 
09 November 2012 
The J.P. Morgan View 
Do US elections change anything? 
• Asset allocation — The equity market has priced out the Romney win scenario, 
but from these levels, our economic and market outlook and risks arc 
unchanged. Thcsc keep us medium-term overweight equities and credit, despite 
the likely volatility as the fiscal cliff is negotiated. Within equities, we stay 
underweight the US, and move most of the overweight into EM Asia. We have 
moved some of our credit overweight from the US to Europe. 
• Economics — The data flows continue to confirm that June/July was likely the 
bottom in global activity growth, and that we arc gently lifting from those 
levels, even as it will take well into next year before growth returns to trend. 
• Fixed Income — Look for yields to head higher, but focus more risk on spread 
compression trades. 
• Equities — We focus our overweights on EM Asia, Cyclical stocks and US 
Home builders. 
• Credit — We see the current dip as an opportunity to add risk. 
• Currencies — Be long the dollar during the fiscal cliff negotiations. 
• Commodities — A further set of better Chinese economic data keeps us long 
base metals. 
• Equity markets are taking the Obama victory quite badly. with US stocks 
down some 4% on Wednesday and Thursday. This has pushed up global bond 
markets, and credit spreads are wider, but commodities are largely ignoring this 
turmoil. We don't think an Obama victory truly changes the economic outlook, 
or risks, but it does eliminate the Romney hope that appeared to have been in 
market pricing. 
• By definition, the Romney scenario is now priced out of the market. The US 
elections confirm the status quo in Washington. and to us, they do so also for 
the broad economic and market outlook, from current levels. Hence, we do not 
see much reason to change our investment allocations, and remain medium-term 
overweight both credit and equities against cash, government debt, and 
commodities. We do so on the basis of value — still high risk premia — fading 
risks on fiscal policy in the US into next year; an expected rebound in global 
growth; and super easy monetary policy, with more QE coming if growth were 
to disappoint. 
• In recent weeks, we have switched out of our long-standing US risk overweight, 
into an underweight, on the argument that the US had the most committed 
central banker, its growth has been least disappointing, and its fiscal risks were 
further into the future. This relative risk has changed, with Chinese economic 
data confirming that its economy is rebounding, while the ECB now creating a 
period a relative financial "peace". The US. in contrast, is at the start of intense 
negotiations on how to avoid a fiscal-cliff induced recession next year. Neither 
side of the aisle has an interest in being blamed for a recession. But markets will 
still be buffeted by a steady news flow on wide gaps between each side's 
position.
