S-1/A 
Outside the United States, we provide localized versions of some of our services to customers through various foreign 
subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in 
which they operate. In Canada, Square Register is the sole payments service we offer, and we are not required to hold a license to 
offer it. We remain in close contact with Finance Canada. which has regulatory authority over payments issues, among other areas. 
Square Register is the sole payments service we offer in Japan and we are not required to hold a license to offer it. We remain in 
close contact with Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, which has regulatory authority over payments issues, among 
other areas. 
Our payments services may be or become subject to regulation by other authorities, and the laws and regulations applicable 
to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are always subject to interpretation and change.

Consumer Financial Protection 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal, local, state, and foreign regulatory agencies regulate financial 
products, including credit, deposit, and payments services, and other similar services. These agencies have broad consumer 
protection mandates, and they promulgate, interpret, and enforce rules and regulations that affect our business. 
Anti-Money Laundering 
We are subject to anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. We have 
implemented an AML program designed to prevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist 
financing, and other illicit activity. Our program is also designed to prevent our network from being used to facilitate business in 
countries, or with persons or entities, included on designated lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of 
Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent foreign authorities. Our AML compliance program includes policies, procedures, reporting 
protocols, and intemal controls, including the designation of an AML compliance officer, and is designed to address these legal and 
regulatory requirements and to assist in managing risk associated with money laundering and terrorist financing. 
Protection and Use of Information 
We collect and use a wide variety of information to help ensure the integrity of our services and to provide features and 
functionality to our customers. This aspect of our business, including the collection, use, and protection of the information we 
acquire from our own services as well as from third-party sources, is subject to laws and regulations in the United States and 
elsewhere. Accordingly, we publish our privacy policies and terms of service, which describe our practices concerning the use, 
transmission, and disclosure of information. As our business continues to expand in the United States and worldwide, and as laws 
and regulations continue to be passed and their interpretations continue to evolve, additional laws and regulations may become 
relevant to us. 
Communications Regulation 
We send texts, emails, and other communications in a variety of contexts, such as when providing digital receipts. 
Communications laws, including those promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, apply to certain aspects of this 
activity in the United States and elsewhere. 
Additional Developments 
Various regulatory agencies in the United States and elsewhere continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could 
impact our business, including products liability, import and export compliance, accessibility for the disabled, insurance, marketing, 
privacy, and labor and employment matters. As our business continues to develop and expand, additional rules and regulations may 
become relevant. For example, if our Square Capital program shifts from an MCA model to a loan model, state and federal rules 
concerning lending could become applicable. Similarly, if we choose to offer Square Payroll in more jurisdictions, additional 
regulations, including tax rules, will apply.
