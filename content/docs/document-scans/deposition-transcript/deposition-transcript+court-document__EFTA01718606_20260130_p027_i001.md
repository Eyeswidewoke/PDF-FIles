I informed you that I selected Mr. 
because he was a friend and classmate of two people 
whom I respected, and that I had never met or spoken with Mr. 
rior to contacting him about 
this case. All of those facts are true. I still have never met Mr. 
and, at the time that he and 
I spoke about this case, he did not know about my relationship wt 
is friend. You su gest that I 
should have ex licitly informed you that one of the referrals came from my 
rather than 
simply a 
' which is the term I used, but it is not my nature to iscuss my personal 
relationships wi opposing counsel. Your attacks on me and on the victims establish why I wanted 
to find someone whom I could trust with safeguarding the victims' best interests in the face of 
intense pressure from an unlimited number of highly skilled and well paid attorneys. Mr. 
was that person. 
One of your letters suggests a business relationship between Mr. 
d my 
This is patentl untrue and neither my 
nor I would have received any financial bene t 
from Mr. 
appointment. Furthermore, after Mr. 
learned more about Mr. Epstein's 
actions (as escri 
below), he expressed a willingnes•andle the case pro bono, with no 
financial benefit even to himself. Furthermore, you were given several other options to choose from, 
including the Podhurst firm, which was later selected by 
M. 
You rejected those other 
options. 
You also allege that I improperly disclosed information about the case to Mr. 
I 
provided Mr.
with a bare bones summary of the agreement's terms related to his appointment 
to help him deci e whether the case was something he and his firm would be willing to undertake. 
I did not provide Mr 
with facts related to the investigation because they were confidential 
and instead recommen 
at he "Google" Mr. Epstein's name for background information. When 
Mr;varig 
asked for additional information to assist his firm in addressing conflicts issues, I 
fo 
those questions to you, and you raised objections for the first time. I did not share any 
further information about Mr. Epstein or the case. Since Mr. 
had been told that you 
concurred in his selection, out of professional courtesy, I inform 
of the Office's 
decision to use a Special Master to make the selection and told him that the 
ce ad made contact 
with •. 
We have had no further contact since then and I have never had contact with 
understand from you that Mr. 
contacted 
. You criticize his 
ecision to o so, yet you feel that you and your co-counsel were entit 
to contact 
to 
try to "lobby" him to select someone to your liking, despite the fact that the N
on 
Agreement vested the Office with the exclusive right to select the attorney representative. 
Another reason for my surprise about your allegations regarding misconduct related to the 
Section 2255 litigation is your earlier desire to have me perform the role of "faci litator" to convince 
the victims that the lawyer representative was selected by the Office to represent their interests alone 
and that the out-of-court settlement of their claims was in their best interests. You now state that 
doing the same things that you had asked me to do earlier is improper meddling in civil litigation. 
Much of your letter reiterates the challenges to Detective 
investigation that have
