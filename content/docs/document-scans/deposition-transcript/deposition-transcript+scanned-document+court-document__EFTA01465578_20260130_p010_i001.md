urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible 
implications of this recently enacted legislation on their investment in the 
Notes. 
For a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your 
investment in a Note, please see the discussion under "U.S. Federal Income 
Tax 
Considerations" in the accompanying prospectus supplement. 
Selected Risk Considerations 
An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the 
Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Currency. 
These 
risks are explained in more detail in the "Risk Factors" section of the 
accompanying prospectus supplement. 
• SUITABILITY OF THE NOTES FOR INVESTMENT — You should only reach a decision 
to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with 
your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment 
objectives and the information set out in this pricing supplement. Neither 
HSBC 
nor any dealer participating in the offering makes any recommendation as to 
the suitability of the Notes for investment. 
• THE AMOUNT PAYABLE ON THE NOTES IS NOT LINKED TO THE SPOT RATE OF THE 
REFERENCE CURRENCT AT ANY 
TIME OTHER THAN ON THE FINAL VALUATION DATE — The Final Spot Rate will be 
based on the Spot Rate of the Reference Currency 
on the Final Valuation Date, subject to postponement and certain market 
disruption events. Even if the Spot Rate of the Reference Currency 
appreciates prior to the Final Valuation Date but then drops on the Final 
Valuation Date to a level that is below the Barrier Level, the Payment at 
Maturity will be less, and may be significantly less, than it would have 
been had the Payment at Maturity been linked to the Spot Rate of the 
Reference Currency prior to such drop. Although the actual Spot Rate of the 
Reference Currency on the Maturity Date or at other times during the 
term of the Notes may be higher than the Final Spot Rate, the Payment at 
Maturity will be based solely on the Final Spot Rate on the Final Valuation 
Date. 
• YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES MAY RESULT IN A LOSS — The Notes do not 
guarantee any return of principal. The return on the 
Notes at maturity is linked to the performance of the Reference Currency and 
will depend on the extent to which the Reference Currency appreciates 
or depreciates. If the Reference Currency has depreciated against the U.S. 
Dollar, compared to the Initial Spot Rate, by more than 15%, then the 
benefit provided by the Barrier Level will terminate. IN THAT SITUATION, YOU 
MAY LOSE UP TO 100% OF YOUR INVESTMENT. 
• THE MAXIMUM RETURN ON THE NOTES IS LIMITED — The payment on your Notes is 
limited to $1,285.00 for each $1,000 Principal 
Amount of Notes. This will be the case even if the Reference Currency has 
appreciated against the U.S. Dollar by more than 28.50%. 
• THE NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO THE CREDIT RISK OF HSBC USA INC. — The Notes are 
senior unsecured debt obligations of the Issuer, 
HSBC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third
