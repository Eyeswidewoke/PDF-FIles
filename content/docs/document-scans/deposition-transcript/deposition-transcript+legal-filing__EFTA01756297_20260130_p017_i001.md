and its priorities through the early period of its existence. What is so f=scinating about these two movements is that, for 
all their transformative =uccess, they have both failed to complete their missions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The =ibbutzim didn't 
turn Israel into a socialist 
paradise, and the hubris and shortsightedness of the Labor elite, which sp=ung from the kibbutz movement, brought 
Israel low in October 1973.</span><=p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">And the religious-n=tionalist settlement movement has 
succeeded in moving hundreds of thousand= of Israelis into the biblical heartland, but it has never been able to co=vince 
the majority of Israelis that 
the absorption of the West Bank into a "Greater Israel" represents the=r country's salvation, rather than a threat to its 
existence. The thwart=d utopianism of these two movements is the subject of "Like Dreamers,"=which is a magnificent 
book, one of the two 
or three finest books about Israel I have ever read. Halevi tells the stor= of seven men -- paratroopers who participated 
in the liberation of Jerusa=em in 1967 -- who became leaders and archetypes of Israeli's competing u=opian 
movements.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">When I met Halevi i= New York recently, I was filled with 
questions about what this history au=ured for Israel's future. The first one to cross my mind: How did the Orth=dox 
settlers so easily supplant the 
leftist kibbutz elite as the nation's pioneering vanguard?</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">"The left lost it= vigor at precisely the moment that religious 
Zionism discovered its own v=gor," Halevi told me. "The key here is 1973. After 1967, not much happ=ned. There were a 
couple of settlements, 
but the Labor government kept everyone on a tight leash, and the religious=Zionists were intensely frustrated. The 
empowering moment for religious Zi=nists was due to Labor's failures in the Yom Kippur War. A generation of=young 
kibbutznikim came out of 1973 
deeply demoralized. People like Porat realized that the left had lost the =lot."</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Halevi went on, "=n Israel, you never naturally evolve from one 
state of thinking to another= We careen. So we careened toward religious Zionism and the settlement 
mov=ment."</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">But in your book, I=said, you suggest that the settlers have failed 
to gain legitimacy for the=r movement among the mass of Israelis. How did they fail? 'The settlemen= movement failed 
during the first Palestinian 
uprising. Israelis realized then the price of the occupation, that there w=s no such thing, as settler leaders promised, as 
a benign occupation. That=kind of illusion went in the late 1980s."</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Halevi noted one sm=ll irony here: If the first Palestinian uprising 
dispelled the idea that I=rael could occupy the Palestinians cost-free and in perpetuity, the second=Palestinian uprising -
- which began 
after the peace process failed in 2000, dispelled the left-wing argument t=at territorial compromise with the 
Palestinians would be easily achieved o=ce Israel opened itself to the possibility of peace.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">'The second upris=ng was the end of the dream of the Peace 
Now movement, because the worst t=rrorism in Israel's history happened after we made the offer for real te=ritorial 
compromise at Camp David, and 
after the Clinton proposals, and after we offered to redivide Jerusalem, b=coming the first country in history to 
voluntarily offer shared sovereignt= in its capital city." 
</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">So, reality has dis=redited both the right and left. What comes 
next? The next great ideologic=l movement in Israeli history is centrism, Halevi said. "The Israeli cen=rist believes two 
things: A. the Arab 
world refuses to recognize our legitimacy and our existence; and B. we can=92t continue occupying them. I believe 
passionately that the left is corre=t about the occupation, and I believe the right is correct in its understa=ding of the 
intentions of the Middle 
East toward the Jewish state."</span></p>
