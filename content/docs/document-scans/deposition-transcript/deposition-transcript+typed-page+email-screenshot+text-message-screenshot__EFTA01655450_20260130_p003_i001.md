FBI Cuts Ties With Anti-Defamation League, Director Patel Says 
Reuters (10/01, Zilber) reported that the FBI announced it had cut ties with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) after 
criticism from conservatives over the group's inclusion of Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA in its glossary on 
extremism. Director Patel stated in a social media post that the bureau "won't partner with political fronts 
masquerading as watchdogs," prompting the ADL to respond that it has "deep respect" for the FBI. According to 
the article, the FBI had historically partnered with the ADL, with records showing collaboration as far back as the 
1940s, and former FBI Director James Comey once highlighted the bureau's joint work with the ADL on civil rights 
and hate crime training for state and local law enforcement. The article explained that Director Patel's 
announcement came after right-wing backlash, including from Elon Musk, leading the ADL to remove the glossary 
entirely from its website. The article noted that the decision reflects both political pressure following Kirk's 
assassination and the broader debate over the ADL's role in documenting extremism, antisemitism, and anti-Israel 
rhetoric. Director Patel posted a statement on X: "James Comey wrote 'love letters' to the ADL and embedded FBI 
agents with them - a group that ran disgraceful ops spying on Americans. That era is OVER. This FBI won't partner 
with political fronts masquerading as watchdogs." Additional reporting on the story was provided by Daily Mail 
(10/01, Lepore), Fox News (10/01, Wolf), Jewish Insider (10/01, Deutch), Just the News (10/01, Severi), National 
Review (10/01, Lynch), New York Post (10/01, Nava), Newsweek (10/01, Silverman), Politico (10/01, Pellish), Raw

COUNTERTERRORISM 
Trump's Approach to Drug Boats 'Mirrors War on Terror Tactics' 
The Independent (10/01, Croft) reported that the Trump administration has launched military strikes in the 
Caribbean against suspected drug boats after designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, with Director 
Patel telling the Senate that "we must treat them like the al-Qaeda of the world because that's how they're 
operating." According to the article, Director Patel defended the use of lethal force, saying the U.S. must 
"eliminate" the drug trade using war authorities and intelligence agencies, echoing manhunting strategies from the 
War on Terror. The article noted that experts have warned such strikes may constitute extrajudicial killings since the 
cartels do not pose the same imminent threat as al-Qaeda, while critics stressed that, unlike past interdictions that 
focused on arrests and seizures, the new approach kills suspects without due process. 
ISIS Supporter Pleads Guilty to Material Support of Terrorism 
BNO News (10/01, Robles) reported that a Minnesota man, Abdisatar Ahmed Hassan, pleaded guilty to attempting 
to provide material support to ISIS after repeatedly trying to travel overseas to join the group. According to the 
article, the FBI began investigating after receiving a tip about social media accounts linked to Hassan that praised 
terrorist attacks, displayed ISIS symbols, and shared propaganda in support of both Al Shabab and ISIS. The article 
noted that investigators discovered Hassan's communications with an ISIS recruiter, files on sniper training, 
explosives manuals, and a homemade ISIS flag, with federal agents later seizing his phones, extremist materials, 
and weapons during his arrest. Hassan admitted to supporting ISIS and believing in the establishment of a 
caliphate, and prosecutors emphasized that his actions demonstrated a desire to kill Americans. He pleaded guilty 
to one federal terrorism charge and now awaits sentencing. "Today's guilty plea reflects many hours of hard work 
by agents and analysts from the FBI," said FBI Minneapolis Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston Sr in the press 
release. "Keeping Minnesota safe from those who support Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations like ISIS and
