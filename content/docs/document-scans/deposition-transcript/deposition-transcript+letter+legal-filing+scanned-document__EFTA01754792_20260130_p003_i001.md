ret=eat of the Americans would serve as a reminder to the rebellion that the powers aren't done with him, that the 
West won=92t redeem and arm the rebels. 
In a flash, Assad w=s willing to sign and ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. A hermetical=y sealed realm, he 
declared, would now be open for international inspector=. That pledge needn't worry him: It was a reasonable bet that 
the crisis would blow over, that the Americans w=uld weary of the matter of Syria. Let the foreign inspectors scour the 
chi=ken coops in the country, let them search the remote Alawite hamlets where=stockpiles could be stored and hidden. 
Assad will have lived to fight another day. 
Obama brought to th=s crisis a willingness to live with a good measure of second-guessing and =idicule. His bet was that 
the country had changed, that the time-honored n=tions of American "credibility" no longer held sway. He had been 
elected to end wars, not to start them, he h=d declared time and again. The traditions of rescue of nations in distress= 
he seemed to imply, have died out in American thought and practice. 
He is a diminished =igure after this debacle. But his devotees never tire. They see wisdom and=prudence in the retreat. 
It is enough for them that Obama isn't George W. Bush chttp://topics.bloomberg.com/george-w.-bush/> , and that Syria 
isn't about to become an American =urden.

The Man With =ink Hair 
Thomas L. Friedman<=span> 
September 17 - I wa= at a conference in Bern, Switzerland, last week and struggling with my co=umn. News of Russia's 
proposal for Syria to surrender its poison gas was=just breaking and changing every hour, forcing me to rewrite my 
column every hour. To clear my head, I went for a=walk along the Aare River, on Schifflaube Street. Along the way, I 
found a=small grocery shop and stopped to buy some nectarines. As I went to pay, l=was looking down, fishing for my 
Swiss francs, and when I looked up at the cashier, I was taken aback: He h=d pink hair. A huge shock of neon pink hair —
very Euro-punk from the =9290s. While he was ringing me up, a young woman walked by, and he blew he= a kiss 
through the window — not a care in the world. Observing all this joie de vivre, I thought to myself: "Wo=, wouldn't it be 
nice to be a Swiss? Maybe even to sport some pink hair?=94 Though I can't say for sure, I got the feeling that the man 
with pink=hair was not agonizing over the proper use of force against Bashar al-Assad. Not his fault; his is a tiny country= 
I guess worrying about Syria is the tax you pay for being an American or =n American president — and coming from the 
world's strongest power tha= still believes, blessedly in my view, that it has to protect the global commons. Barack 
Obama once had black hai=. But his is gray now, not pink. That's also the tax you pay for thinkin= about the Middle East 
too much: It leads to either gray hair or no hair, =ut not pink hair. 
Well, bring on the =recian Formula, because our leaders will need it. My big take-away from th= whole Syria imbroglio is 
that — with Europe ailing, China AWOL and the =rab world convulsing — for an American president to continue to lead
