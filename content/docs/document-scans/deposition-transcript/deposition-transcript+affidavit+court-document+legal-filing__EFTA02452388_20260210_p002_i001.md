You have a=ked me to make a prescription without seeing the patient. In medical=terms that would be 
malpractice. but . as I have great respect and f=ndness for my new friends . I will do my best , though it must be ke=t in 
the forefront of your mind that changes will be necessar= according to the details and priorities of the Kingdom. 
prono=nced by them , not by my interpretation. 
=C2 1 . Aramco. . the kingdom is being treated =s one of the many wealthy but unsophisticated investors. 
wall stree= and consultants look upon this opportunity as taking a cow to slaug=ter. 
The Kingdom in my 
understanding would like to diversify=its economy and be Money rich , to give it flexibility and security. =AO taking the 
co public is an idea of 25 years ago. it =s silly, 
shareholders are the last thing the kingdom needs. =C2 they are 
eventual weapons in any attack. world wide regulation= banking securities etc have tilted the balance of power in their 
fa=or , at least for the time being , having a public co.=C2 comes with many unnecessary constraints, future lawsuits. 
=AO ( U.S. 9/11 only the beginning. ). etc. 
=AO Having money, financial power is not equal to having a public vehicle=C2 with reams of disclosures. legal 
minefields . all good f=r lawyers and bankers but certainly not the best path for a SOVEREIG=. 
a) money needs .=C2 -- domestic and int'l =AO / should the kingdom consider its own internal currency 
=AO in addition to world currency. like the IMF , specia= depository receipts. these SDRs wer= created for a specific 
purpose. the equivalent can be created for =A internal use. note any solution that does not take i=to account the 
vast increases in computer power and Internet =span>ie the public offering of Aramco should be immedi=tely 
suspicious. The military would never use weapons of the 60s in =oday's battles , so it should not use antiquated 
solutions to th= financial problems of today. 
b. =AO the kingdom can issue debt backed by oil, currency e=changeable into oil. ? it would be the 
strongest currency quickly a= most countries today are merely fiat. 
=c. investment in infra structure MUST take into account=that are now living in a ZERO interest rate 
environment. =Saudi , china and Russia , could begin to use other complementary currenci=s that would stay outside of 
the US banking system, a system t=at is often used as a hammer. 
2 . =cting as a large sovereign wealth fund, is antiquated. there i= not shortage of huge amounts of capital 
and merely competing with hundred= of the most sophisticated investors is a losing game. H=WEVER the country is a 
SOVEREIGN. this is the bigg=st asset. not its wealth alone. Sovereign nations are the only=entities that can issues 
world wide accepted currencies . most=nations that have considered this are asset poor , so the currency is virt=ally 
worthless. SA presents a unique opportunity.=C2 
What will the money be used for? =C2 why have the same 
money for military equipment from another co=ntry as the money the local Jeddah resident uses=to buy milk/ 
3 operational , I =ould not take Aramco public. I however would use it to r=ise money. . 
=AO 
=C2 
I would take whatever step= necessary to bring the high knowledge base in tech, 
medicine, education t= the Kingdom. physically bring people there will NOT wor=. there is no need to have 
geographic limitations. =C2 ie the Chinese have seeded many people and=cos in their drive to bolster their seat at the 
world financial tabl=. SA can do the same. Knowledge is the mobile valuable c=mmodity, exchange oil for land, 
knowledge and currencies.
