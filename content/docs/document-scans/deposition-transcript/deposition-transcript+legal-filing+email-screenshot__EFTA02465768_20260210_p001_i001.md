Dear Je=frey, I would appreciate if you could answer some of these questions in or=er for us to be on the same 
page and clarify some doubts we have: 
1. We understand that master retreat should have a small &=uot;owner's kitchen" nearby for eventual light 
snacks and light c=oking. Should this kitchen be part of the master retreat (same level) for =our personal use or can the 
ladies' kitchen service you and them? 
2. Should the ladies kitchen be completely enclosed or=can it be open or semi-open into their living/dining room 
areas? 
3. Will you eventually visit the ladies' living areas o= it is exclusively for their use? Seating/Dining in their area 
should be c=nsidered only for four people? 
4. I am aware you =entioned that the master retreat windows will not be opened so we will mak= sure to use 
fixed panels and nothing sliding but Im a bit confused about =our expectation for this room's facade. Should it be more 
mass than wi=dows like your current bedroom or should it be more glass and light like t=e image in the presentation? 
5. During our =ast visit we discussed about putting the ladies' residence where the e=isting pool deck is; 
however, as we discussed today, it might still be too=close to the master retreat. We are exploring the possibility to 
send them=up to where the existing solar panels are, in order to have more privacy b=t to keep the driving distance 
short. Does this make sense to you? 
6. Do you like the concept of having 4 identical rooms su=rounding a new small pool/sunbathing area for the 
ladies' private use?=Or do you prefer that each room is somewhat unique? 
7. We will design much nicer/open bathrooms that the ones you saw drawnr=however, do you want them to 
have open showers/tubs? Or everything should =e indoors?
