Reminder Message from JEE: 
90 percent right. most work really great some ,unfortunatley mostly my f=ult - bad. some ,(divan ) others just 
overlooked . fyi it appears t=mp fan in back got disconnected, hot in cabin over the atlantic, not much f=n. but .. it 
happens. 
1. the sides of the cabin door in front are two different colors. ? very=ugly 
2 'Phone charger not good for flying. not solid. Shakes, 
3 I suggest we inset leather on drink rails, cover cup holders and make the= smaller. for voss. and find magnetic charger 
so phone is secure. 
4. my captain chair needs a side pouch low hidden for glasses and pens. w= might make the arms wider on just this 
chair 5. footrests. need adjustment, they are currently useless. we should mak= a small ottoman. 
6. Pronto remote works well and should be installed in place of small screen=behind the panels on the window line. 
7. the table mechanism needs to be re-cut. Some magnets taken out. and sti=fened where it meets the verical panel. 
which had a lot of rattles larr= has video 
8. I think we should put a stictch on the leather insert tray table tops. t=ey look a little like placemats. without 9. the 
Pilots seat arm rest needs more foam on top arm rest to be taller, Pi=ots arm does not reach the arm rest, even when 
extended to tallest position= maybe wider foam arm rest as well, so when stored they don't shake/Rattle,=and 
taller/thicker foam to meet pilots arm., 10. the chairs in the cabin were shaking quite a bit on take off 11. the psu in the 
galley which looks great should be changed to white and m=re down wash lights installed. 
12. credenz top should be white to match the galley, and seats like the GIV.=13. we should cover aft bulkhead and lay 
door with fabric 14. many of the doors and latches were rattling 15. shelf for food storage with proper size top opening 
bag. 
16. In rear LAV the entrance to Baggage compartment has a Head Bumper over t=e baggage door we left the old leather, 
change to white. 
17. the psu over the sink should be white and cut back and made shorter, I k=pt banging my head when brushing my 
teeth 
18 some type of cover for toilet paper 
19. more cushion on potty seat. PLENTY of room 
20 new potty seat. not nice 
21. L/H Rear bulkhead Aft magazine holder that houses Aft Cabin Temp fan sho=ld be covered as well in fabric.
