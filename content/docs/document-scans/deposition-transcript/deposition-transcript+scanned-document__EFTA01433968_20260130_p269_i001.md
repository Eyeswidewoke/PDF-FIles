RIN II - 094 Alpha Group Capital LLC 
Tax Treatment of the Issuer 
The Issuer will elect to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income 
tax purposes. The Issuer intends to operate so as 
not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income. In this 
regard, the Issuer will receive an opinion of tax counsel 
to the effect that, if the Issuer and the Portfolio Advisor comply with the 
applicable Facility documentation and the Portfolio 
Advisory Agreement, including the tax guidelines referenced therein (the 
"Tax Guidelines") and certain other assumptions 
specified in the opinion are satisfied, although no authority exists that 
deals with situations substantially similar to those of 
the Issuer, the contemplated activities of the Issuer will not cause the 
Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business 
within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes under current 
law. Failure of the Issuer or the Portfolio Advisor 
to comply with the Tax Guidelines or the applicable Facility documentation 
may not give rise to a default or an Event of 
Default under the applicable Facility documentation or the Portfolio 
Advisory Agreement and may not give rise to a claim 
against the Issuer or the Portfolio Advisor. In the event of such a failure, 
the Issuer could be engaged in a trade or business 
within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
In addition, in certain circumstances the Tax Guidelines 
permit the Issuer to receive an opinion or written advice from other 
nationally recognized U.S. tax counsel to the effect that 
any changes in its structure and operations will not cause the Issuer to be 
engaged in a trade or business within the United 
States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of tax counsel will 
assume that any such advice will be accurate in 
all 
respects. The opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS or the 
courts. Moreover, a change in law or its 
interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a 
trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a 
net income basis. If it is determined that the 
Issuer is engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has 
taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or 
business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to 
the regular U.S. federal corporate income tax (currently, 21%) on its 
effectively connected taxable income, possibly on a 
gross basis, and possibly to a 30% branch profits tax and state and local 
taxes as well. The remainder of this discussion 
assumes that the Issuer is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net 
income. 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Issuer, and not the Co-Issuer, 
will be treated as the issuer of the Preferred 
Shares.
