A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of 
information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer 
reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell 
information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a 
summary of your major rights under FCRA. For more information, including information 
about additional rights, go to www.consumerfinance.govilearnmore or write to: Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552. 
• You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses 
a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, 
insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and 
must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the 
information. 
o You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the 
information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your "file disclosure"). You 
will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security 
number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if: 
• a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report; 
• you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file; 
▪ your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud; 
• you are on public assistance; 
• you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days. 
In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request 
from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting 
agencies. See www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore for additional information. 
o You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your 
credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score 
from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential 
real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will 
receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender. 
• You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify 
information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting 
agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See 
www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore for an explanation of dispute procedures. 
o Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or 
unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information must be 
removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may 
continue to report information it has verified as accurate. 
o Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most 
cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than 
seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old. 
o Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about 
you only to people with a valid need - usually to consider an application with a creditor, 
insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for 
access.
