I see a young girl genuinaly happy enjoying every moment of=her Life. Tell me what should i change ? What do 
you want from me? You com= into my life, you disappear, you always make me feel as if there is somet=ing wrong, it 
seems that you want to punish me for anything. This is the w=y I am. Everyday I grow and learn something new, 
dicovering new places, ne= cultures, new people. Life is a continuous discovery and should be fun. N=t a pain in the ass. 
If you really are my friend you should accept me=the way I am and not try to change me all the time in things that I am 
not= However, I am happy to learn anything that can help me grow in a better p=rson. Goodnight

me think I'm =ot such a horrible person as you say.
