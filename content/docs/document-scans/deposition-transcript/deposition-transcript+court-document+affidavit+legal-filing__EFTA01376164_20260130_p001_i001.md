(a) 
it is an obligation of a debtor-in-possession as described in Section 1107 of the 
Bankruptcy Code or a trustee (if appointment of such trustee has been ordered pursuant to 
Section 1104 of the Bankruptcy Code) (a "Debtor") organized under the laws of the United 
States or any State therein; 
(b) 
it is paying interest on a current basis; 
(c) 
its terms have been approved by an order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the U.S. 
District Court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, the enforceability of which order is 
not subject to any pending contested matter or proceeding (as such terms are defined in the

(i) 
it is secured by liens on the Debtor's otherwise unencumbered assets 
pursuant to Section 364(cX2) of the Bankruptcy Code; 
(ii) 
it is secured by liens of equal or senior priority on property of the Debtor's 
estate that is otherwise subject to a lien pursuant to Section 364(d) of the Bankruptcy 
Code; 
(iii) 
it is secured by junior liens on the Debtor's encumbered assets (provided 
that it is fully secured based upon a current valuation or appraisal report); or 
(iv) 
if it or any portion of it is unsecured, its repayment retains priority over all 
other administrative expenses pursuant to Section 364(cX1) of the Bankruptcy Code and 
Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained; 
(d) 
unless Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained from S&P, it has a rating 
from S&P no lower than "CCC" (which rating shall have been confirmed by S&P since the most

related to its restructuring or amendment will be forwarded to each Rating Agency.

consecutive days. Any Collateral Obligation that would otherwise be considered a Discount 
Obligation but that is purchased with the proceeds of a sale of a Collateral Obligation that was 
not a Discount Obligation at the time of purchase will not be considered a Discount Obligation if 
such Collateral Obligation (a) together with all such Collateral Obligations excluded from the
