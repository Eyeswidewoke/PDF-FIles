a. 
Broken "Sex Toss" in Mr. Epstein's Trash. The Police Report details the police 
finding in Mr. Epstein's trash what is described as broken pieces of a "sex toy" and 
that this "discovery" purportedly corroborated witness statements. Omitted from both 
the Police Report and the Probable Cause Affidavit is the filet that during the course 
of executing the search warrant in Epstein's home, the police discovered the other 
piece of that key "sex toy" and realized it was in Iitct only the broken handle of a 
salad server. Though "sex toys" play a prominent role in the Police Report and 
Pmbable Cause Affidavit. the Ma: Report was never amended to reflect the 
discovery of this new and highly relevant evidence. 
4. 
Failure to Consider Exculpatory or Impeaching Evidence. Other exculpatory and 
impeaching evidence known by the PBPD was omitted from the Police Report and 
Probable Cause Affidavit by. in our view, manipulating the date the investigation was 
allegedly dosed. 
According to the Police Report (at $5). Detective 
"explained Ito MA Belohlavek) that the PBPD had concluded its ease in Deccm ler 
of 2005". That assertion, which is false. conveniently resulted in the omission of all 
information adduced subsequent to that date. Thus, though the Police Report in fact 
contains information obtained after December 2005. the PBPD purported to justify its 
refusal to consider, or even to include, in the Police Report, the Probable Cause 
Affidavit or what it released to the public, all the exculpatory• and evidence 
impeaching the witnesses submitted on behalf of Mr. Epstein. most or which was 
provided alter December 2005. That evidence is listed below. 
5. 
unreported Criminal Histories and Mental Health Problems of the Witnesses 
Relied on in the Police Report and Probable Cause Affidavit. Evidence obtained 
concerning the wimesses relied upon to support the Probable Cause Affidavit casts 
significant doubt on whether these witnesses are sufficiently credible to support a 
finding of probable cause, let alone to sustain what would be the pmseention's burden 
&proof at a trial .4 Though such evidence was submitted to the MD. none or it was 
included in the Police Report or the Probable Cause Affidavit. 
• 
While the 
t e Report (at 57) and the Probable Cause Affidavit (at 
_ 
contain assertions by 
which allegedly support bringing a criminal charge. 
the evidence revealing 
evident mental instability; prior criminal conduct 
against 
stein; and bias towards Epstein is notably omitted. As detailed above, in 
2001, 
was filmed taking money from Epstein's home. Ma being caught an 
videotape unlawfully entering Epstein's home and stealing cash from a briefcase,
