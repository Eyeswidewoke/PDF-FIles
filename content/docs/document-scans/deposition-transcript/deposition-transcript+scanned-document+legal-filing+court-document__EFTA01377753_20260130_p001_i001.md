repurchased by us due to failure to vest, the unissued shares (or for awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights, 
the forfeited or repurchased shares) will become available for future grant or sale under the 2015 Plan. With respect to stock 
appreciation rights, the net shares issued will cease to be available under the 2015 Plan and all remaining shares will remain 
available for future grant or sale under the 2015 Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or satisfy the tax 
withholding obligations related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under the 2015 Plan. To the extent an 
award is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment will not result in a reduction in the number of shares available for 
issuance under the 2015 Plan. 
Plan Administration. 
The compensation committee of our board of directors will administer our 2015 Plan. In the case of 
awards intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the committee 
will consist of two or more "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m). The administrator will have the power to 
administer our 2015 Plan, including but not limited to, the power to interpret the terms of our 2015 Plan and awards granted under 
it, to create, amend, and revoke rules relating to our 2015 Plan, including creating sub-plans, and to determine the terms of the 
awards, including the exercise price, the number of shares subject to each such award, the exercisability of the awards, and the 
form of consideration, if any, payable upon exercise. The administrator also has the authority to amend existing awards, to allow 
participants the opportunity to transfer outstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the 
administrator, and to institute an exchange program by which outstanding awards may be surrendered in exchange for awards of 
the same type which may have a higher or lower exercise price or different terms, awards of a different type, and/or cash. 
Stock Options. 
Stock options may be granted under our 2015 Plan. The exercise price of options granted under our 2015 
Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. The term of an incentive 
stock option may not exceed ten years, except that with respect to any participant who owns more than 10% of the voting power of 
all classes of our outstanding stock, the term must not exceed five years and the exercise price must equal at least 110% of the 
fair market value on the grant date subject to the provisions of our 2015 Plan. The administrator will determine the methods of 
payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, cash, shares, or other 
property acceptable to the administrator, as well as other types of consideration, subject to the provisions of our 2015 Plan. After 
the termination of service of an employee, director, or consultant, he or she may exercise his or her option for the period of time 
stated in his or her option agreement. Generally, if termination is due to death or disability, the option will remain exercisable for 12 
months. In all other cases, the option generally will remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. An 
option may not be exercised later than the expiration of its term. However, if the exercise of an option is prevented by applicable 
laws, the exercise period may be extended under certain circumstances. 
Stock Appreciation Rights. 
Stock appreciation rights may be granted under our 2015 Plan. Stock appreciation rights allow 
the recipient to receive a payment equal to the appreciation in the fair market value of our Class A common stock between the 
exercise date and the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights may not have a term exceeding ten years. After the termination of 
service of an employee, director, or consultant, his or her stock appreciation right will be subject to the same exercise limitations 
that apply to stock options described above. Subject to the provisions of our 2015 Plan, the administrator will determine the other 
terms of stock appreciation rights, including when such rights become exercisable and whether to pay any amount of appreciation 
in cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, except that the per share exercise price for the shares to 
be issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right must be no less than 100% of the fair market value per share on 
the date of grant.

Restricted Stock. 
Restricted stock may be granted under our 2015 Plan. Restricted stock awards are grants of shares of 
our Class A common stock that vest in accordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator. The administrator 
will determine the number of shares of restricted stock granted to any employee, director or consultant and, subject to the 
provisions of our 2015 Plan, will determine the terms and conditions of such awards. The administrator may impose whatever 
conditions to vesting it determines to be appropriate (for example, the administrator may set restrictions based on the achievement 
of specific performance goals or continued service to us): and may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time at which any 
restrictions will lapse or be removed. Recipients of restricted stock awards generally will have voting rights but not dividend rights
