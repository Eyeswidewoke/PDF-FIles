now but it seems obvious that leading by example or just being kind is a more constructive way to 
communicate than attacking each other...

yes, I read them and its all about what i do , it took a year of arguing before you gave in, 
you mean i didnt give in as quickly. and you take that to be a bad thing, it is your belief that 
I should succumb to petty ,behavior based on nothing more than childish jealousies. while 
all the time ignoring the fact that you do not do much but complain.

Sorry but you didn't do any of those things the way you did this one.,it took a year of arguing to explain to 
you every one of those issues and it is still a compromise,M after 2 years still lives at 301, still comes 
to florida, you hired IM after I wanted her to leave, moved her to 301 and she still visits as well, you 
took hundreds of naps with 
after we already talked about it and watched movies in the office every 
night hugging and being affectionate to these people...all of that knowing it was painful for me and i 
needed something from you that you didn't find justifiable or important enough. I know you were not 
trying to hurt me and I had to deal with the fact you are just going to do what you want. I obviously can't 
force you to do anything. 
With this email you actually took my needs into consideration without fighting me (well, until now) , I 
appreciated it, I realized how much nicer it is and I should do that for you too. ( this would be the point 
where i am dealing with my own actions and i am not content with them ) 
I don't see why we are arguing now...are you actually reading my emails?

All I needed to see was you actually taking a step to do what was important to me .. no naps no 
movie watching, no 
, no 
, these are all the same , just this one thing. , jeffrey 
doing something he detests just to demonstrate to 
that he is willing to give up what 
he believes in. no matter how little he recieves in return.. It is just one more thing. no 
more no less. you seem content not to deal with your actions. only mine. it is not helpful 
constructive or fair.
