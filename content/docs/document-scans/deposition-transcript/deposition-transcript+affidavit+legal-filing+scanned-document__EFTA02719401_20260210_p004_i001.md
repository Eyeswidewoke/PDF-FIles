elimination of certain inequities and administrative problems, the mirror system ought to continue 
as the territory's tax system. Finally, the Virgin Islands viewed the Tax Reform Act as a vehicle for 
the expansion of its financial services industry-- specifically, that it should contain provisions 
authorizing the establishment of tax exempt companies in the territory. 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contained three major substantive changes relating to the Virgin 
Islands: the loophole closing provisions referred to above, a new code section substantially 
eliminating most of the adverse effects of the mirror system on individuals, while retaining the 
mirror system generally, and the provision authorizing the establishment of the U.S. Virgin Islands 
exempt company. Of major importance to the Virgin Islands Government was the fact that it would 
be permitted to continue to administer its own tax system without federal interference, and that the 
system would still be the mirror, but now an "improved" mirror. Unlike the treatment accorded the 
other territories, the maintenance of the mirror system was seen by the Virgin Islands as a means of 
continuing a familiar (albeit admittedly complex) system, with familiar forms, regulations, and 
rulings, and without the need to endure the political and economic upheaval that could be wrought 
by having to write a new tax code. 
The first mirror improvement is that for the purposes of individual taxation, the United States is 
deemed to include the Virgin Islands and the Virgin Islands is deemed to include the United States. 
This change alone eliminated a substantial portion of the administrative and interpretative 
headaches for both taxpayers and the respective tax administrations. For example, prior to the 
enactment of these deeming provisions, U.S. citizens had been treated for Virgin Islands tax 
purposes (disadvantageously, in most instances) as if they had been non- resident aliens, but the 
new provision restored their "tax citizenship." 
The other most significant mirror system improvement was the provision authorizing exempt 
companies: The strict mirror rule that a Virgin Islands taxpayer must pay the same amount of tax as 
his counterpart in the United States, was eliminated for the first time since 1960 in respect to 
income from sources outside the Virgin Islands and not effectively connected with a trade or 
business in the Virgin Islands. This broad authorization of tax reductions for non-U.S. source 
income, was designed to provide a new "product" to stimulate the growth of the financial services 
sector in the U.S. Virgin Islands and to provide the Virgin Islands government with a potential 
source of new revenue. 
The section of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 providing the authorization for Virgin Islands exempt 
companies could only become effective upon the effective date of an implementation agreement 
between the Virgin Islands and the United States. As with the implementation agreements to be 
adopted by the other three territories, the Virgin Islands implementation agreement is designed to 
facilitate the sharing of tax information and the elimination of double taxation, and to end tax 
evasion or improper avoidance. As the Virgin Islands was particularly eager to begin its exempt 
company program, it was the first of the four territories to negotiate and approve an 
implementation agreement. The Virgin Islands implementation agreement, along with the exempt 
company federal authorization provision, became effective on February 24, 1987.
