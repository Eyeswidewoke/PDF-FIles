Jeffrey, I had no idea what was reality before. You started by sending me=an

of money ending up doing stupid things and not taking li=e seriously. Even if I was told, everything seemed very abstract 
in my min=. Now that I collapsed I know. Now that I find myself in this situation, t=at I've started working and earning 
some, I understand how hard it is =nd how much work there is behind and wish everyday I knew this before... I=don't 
earn a house and the money I earn doesn't even cover the ren= even though I'm working. Jeffrey, I did understand the 
lesson. I beg =ou, please forgive me. I need your help. I'm drowning, I'm not abl= to support myself all alone.
