is better in =onversation. Not simple answer. I'll get you the details you =sked when I get back. Think of it roughly like 
this. I paid 3.75/share. =he current round is closing at 16/share and IPO roughly 18.50. Can sell =f we want 6month later. 
I haven't tried to sell my shares but =f I wanted to I could have sold to Perceptive Advisors at that price in =ast round. 
3. Yes it will to finish. I have this modeled out and can get =ou exact numbers when back to office. It will take 
about 75% of the =emaining cash from refinancing. 
4. Completely agree. This is my biggest =eakness in business and it's the most important. I will get on =his ASAP. 
5. = have spent a lot of time in factory and with management team and =mployees. It's a good management 
team. Prior to investment and =fter. Also at trade shows with doctors and KOL's. The top =OL's has left Allergen and 
Mentor to EL. Also visited London =ospital Group that has most experience with EL. I have spent time with =effries team 
as well many times. Michael Robinson Managing Director of =ealthcare Investment Banking and Benjamin Lorello Global 
Head of =nvestmwnt Banking are running point on IPO. They were the ones that set =he expected valuation and time 
table. Shooting for June right =ow. 
All the =est,

only as a result of you asking for my =dvice. I suggest the following. 1 =eal numbers are needed. 
real market =umbers. ie put the apt on the markeet to see =hat bids you get. ? ex ask for 10m = see what happens. 
2. re the only other main asset. =stablishment lab. - the " they" that you refenced that =refer you not share numbers

investment of =m. 
there have been multiple financings in =etween and more to come. so . establish how many 
=hares you actually own now. how many total shares there are =n a diluted basis... valutation models mean little .. 
=hen have someone do a comp on silmilar cos based in costra =ica. . to detiremine possible future value. but =rankly 
hihgly unlikely in the next 18 months. , in the =lternative m, ask to see how much one of the others w0ould =ay for your 
current positoin. . lm 5m? . then =ubrtract taxes on gain. 3. the new york apt. =ill also require more capital . as it 
always does.. 4. =ake some accounting courses and financila reporting classes.. 5 =ts all about numbers. i see 
establishments PR is geared =owards hype and not substance.. its financing of 55m was =eported, but said partial debt. 
if someone told =ou that Jeffries is thining about taking it public CHECK =or yourself. call the person at Jeffries. the 
=ey -accurate numbers and NO SECOND hand info.. hard to =elieve that the team doesnt have better photos to put on 
their =eb and reports. very odd
