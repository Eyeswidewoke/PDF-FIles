• Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting 
entity at the measurement date 
• Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
• Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable 
inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability 
at measurement date. 
On August 21, 2015, the Company amended its payment processing agreement with Starbucks such that, as of October 1, 
2015, the Company is no longer Starbucks' exclusive payment processing provider. Starbucks can terminate the agreement upon 
30 days' prior notice, and any payment processing volumes will be subject to increased rates beginning on October 1, 2015. As 
part of this amendment, the previously unvested warrants related to processing targets in the United Kingdom and Japan have 
been canceled. Additionally, the Company agreed to facilitate the sale of 2.269,830 shares of Series D preferred stock held by 
Starbucks to a third party. If the aggregate purchase price in a sale to a third party of the Series D preferred stock is less than $37 
million, then the Company will pay Starbucks the difference. This obligation terminates upon the expiration of any applicable lock-
up period following an initial public offering. In the event that such obligation has not terminated, and the shares have not been 
sold, by October 30, 2016, the Company is obligated to repurchase the shares for an aggregate purchase price of $37 million. 
The Company has designated this obligation as a derivative instrument initially valued at $1.5 million to be measured at fair 
value on a recurring basis, categorized as a Level 3 measurement. The Company used a Monte Carlo pricing model to determine 
the fair value of this derivative instrument as of September 30, 2015. The Monte Carlo pricing model considers various inputs such 
as the fair value of the preferred shares, the probability of completing an initial public offering, and the probability of identifying a 
third party investor. Adjusting significant inputs would not have a material impact to the fair value of this instrument. To the extent 
this obligation remains outstanding, the Company will measure the fair value of this derivative instrument on a quarterly basis with 
incremental increases or decreases in its value, if any, recorded as changes to Starbucks transaction revenue in the applicable 
quarter.
