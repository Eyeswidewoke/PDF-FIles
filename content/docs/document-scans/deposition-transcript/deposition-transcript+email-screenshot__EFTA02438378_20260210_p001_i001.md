First I want to express my gratefulness for remarks you've gave it to me. I work hard to break the 
ice I've lived in and danced in...I do admit, it is not easy...I have to think about completely 
different style and motions they teach me in the conservatoire and in the same time dance as a 
wind! "Open" as you told! I am trying to move widely with my look up! oh. Dear Jeffrey, I have 
so much to do in the class and in my life! I am so appreciate that you guiding me on my journey. 
As you know I didn't know exactly where I was going, but the conservatoire seems much better 
as we thought... that place is the second school after opera de Paris school! The masters of dance 
are very famous dancers. 
I am just very lucky! I have the best chance to learn from the bests! the moment when I get the 
opportunity to make some pictures I will send to you right the way! The studios are huge, 
beautiful! Jeffrey in the ballet class they play piano and violin! Alive music! That's so 
wonderful... so I attend ballet, Alterie, Contemporary, repertoire classes...it is exact school I 
needed to be at that moment. 
Recently I feel weak...there are almost tree weeks I have a flue. its my fault, because I don't eat 
enough food which helps my body to be strong. But that's the student life! To buy at 
bargain...But today I went in the pharmacy to get some vitamins otherwise people won't stop 
asking what's wrong with me! Feels like I've used all the energy I had! Honestly I look ugly like 
never before! I think is also tension, anxiety...Definitely I couldn't avoid maladies...my packed 
which I sent from Lithuania to Lyon with all the things I needed, was picked and just taken. I 
was so upset...I am missing my new point shoes, honey, new boots, tempox ( unbelievable! who 
needs tempox! )and many other things which I bought... I know it is just the things, but still...I 
paid for that... how people can take something what do not belong to them! I claim for 
compensation...i wrote a letter telling what I am missing, but I haven't got the answer yet from a 
company which was responsible for my package.
