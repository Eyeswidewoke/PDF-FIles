any past or future delay. Mr. Epstein currently has four Florida Bar members on his defense team, 
so attorney scheduling is not an adequate basis for delay. 
Three weeks ago I also asked you to provide our Office with the terms of the Plea Agreement 
with the State Attorney's Office. It is now more than two months since the signing of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement and we have yet to see any formal agreement, or even a list of essential terms 
of such an agreement. 
Next, let me address your allegation that attorneys in our office and agents of the FBI have 
leaked information to the press in an effort to affect possible civil litigation with Mr. Epstein. This 
is untrue. There has been no contact between .any member of the press and any employee of our 
office or the FBI since you incorrectly accused investigators of telling "Vanity Fair" about Mr. 
Starr's employment by Mr. Epstein several months ago. We intend to continue to refrain from 
commenting or providing information to the press. We would ask that your client and all of his 
representatives do the same. 
I also want to address your interpretation of several statements that were included in 
correspondence — at your insistence — as proof that the designated victims have invalid claims. Let 
me make clear that each of the listed individuals are persons whom the Office identified as victims 
as defined in Section 2255, that is, as persons "who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of 
section . . . 2422 or 2423 of this title." In other words, the Office is prepared to indict Mr. Epstein 
based upon Mr. Epstein's "interactions" with these individuals.' This conclusion is based upon a 
thorough and proper investigation — one in which none of the victims was informed of any right to 
receive damages of any amount prior to the investigation of her claim. The Office.agrees that it is 
not a party to, and will not take a role in, any civil litigation, but the Office can say, without 
hesitation, that the evidence demonstrates that each person on the list was a victim of Mr. Epstein's 
criminal behavior. Mr. Starr's letter also suggests that the number of victims to whom Mr. Epstein 
is exposed by the Agreement is limitless. As you know, early drafts of the Agreement contained a 
numerical limit of 40 victims, which was removed at your request. The Office repeatedly confirmed 
that the number would not exceed 40; and the list is significantly shorter than that. Once the list is 
provided to you, if you have a good faith basis for asserting that a victim never met Mr. Epstein, we 
remain willing to listen and to modify the list if you convince us of your position. 
Finally, let me address your objections to the draft Victim Notification Letter. You write that 
you don't understand the basis for the Office's belief that it is appropriate to notify the victims. 
Pursuant to the "Justice for All Act of 2004," crime victims are entitled to: "The right to reasonable, 
accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding . . involving the crime" and the "right 
'Unlike the State's investigation, the federal investigation shows criminal conduct by Mr. 
Epstein at least as early as 2001, so all of the victims were minors at the time of the offense.
