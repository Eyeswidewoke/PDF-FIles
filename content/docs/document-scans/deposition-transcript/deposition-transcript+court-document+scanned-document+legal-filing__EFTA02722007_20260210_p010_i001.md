went beyond the simple forms of support extended to Masud, with whom it had a complex 
relationship. Iran's support encompassed all the actors of this coalition. And this support was 
essential, as at the time divisions ran deep inside the group. The Iranians made sure that the 
Shiites in the Northern Alliance would always be strong enough to defend their interests.'" 
Iran also supported the Uzbek groups in the Alliance, at a time where they were divided 
between Rashid Dostum and Abdullah Malik.42 Indeed, Russia and India were also helping 
the anti-Taliban coalition, and the Russians seemed to have persuaded the Americans, after 
9/11, to ally with Masud to better destroy the Taliban's regime. But the Iranians were by far 
the most active43 players and were the ones who were 'closer' to the US policy, without any 
particular `secret' agenda at the time.44 These strong links were essential to persuade the 
Northern Alliance that the Americans could be trusted allies. After all, Washington had, 
before 9/1 1, criticised Tehran for its support of the Northern Alliance. The Iranians were also 
of great help to the White House, when the Northern Alliance had to be convinced that it 
should work with those Pashtuns who were equally opposed to the Taliban.45 With such 
information, it seems clear that, without Iran, the initial US campaign against the Taliban 
could have run into many more obstacles, and Afghanistan could have been much more 
destabilised by the post-9/I I foreign intervention from the start. 
What confirms this line of argument is the fact that, during the American campaign against 
the Taliban, the Iranians have been very active in helping in the fight against the common 
enemy. For example they opened the Chah Bahar port to facilitate humanitarian help for the 
Afghans. They gave critical and very reliable intelligence to the Americans, offered access to 
Iranian airfields near the Afghan borders, and arrested numerous Taliban and Al Qaeda 
fighters who were trying to escape through Iran. These actions were proof of an Iranian 
foreign policy focus on regional stability above anything else, as Tehran did not make this 
support conditional on America changing its long-term policy towards the Islamic Republic 
of Iran. In fact the Iranian elites were thinking, at the time, that such a responsible choice 
would dissipate the American preconceptions about Iran.3/4 This responsible attitude, focusing 
on regional stability, explains Iran's positive policy towards Afghanistan at the very
