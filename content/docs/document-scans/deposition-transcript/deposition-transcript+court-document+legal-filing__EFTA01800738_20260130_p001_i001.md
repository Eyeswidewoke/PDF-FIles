I miss you. You rock. You have no idea how much good stuff you gave me. It's amazing. I just wake up and have 
money fall on me. I don't feel like I am working at all. I am very excited to work though. Its fun. I love the people in my 
life. It would be nice if you were one of them, but maybe when you get organized we can spend more time together. 
I think I met my match, a guy I work with. I want to mary him. He is the only person that is not intimidated by me 
and I can pitch and catch with. I also met an amazing guy in. 
he is very much like you. The only difference is 
he talks! How cool is that? And I can eat him for breakfast. He is totally crazy about me. He said the way he feels when 
he is with me is more close than with his wife of 15 years. He is shocked that someone is able to understand and connect 
with him. I love it. To me its like a nice carrot for you. The best part is that I found a replacement to meet my needs that 
is very kosher. 
I have one more guy. He is a player and seems like a jerk but is actually an amazing guy. I gave him my date w 
destiny notebook and he was so grateful. He told me he completely redid his personal and business goals. That is so 
awesome. 
Ok One more guy. He is russian and we had the best sex ever. His name is 
I thought I really liked him, 
but then he started playing hard to get. That turns me off. I want guys who are crazy about me and appreciate me, not 
the ones I have to run after. I had enough of that. The poor man is driving himself nuts. He is trying to get hard to get, 
but is playing all by himself because I really don't care. It's amusing. Well at least he can introduce me to cute girls. His 
behavior reminds me of 
He became so uncomfortable after I cut him off. He feels like he has no hold on me 
whatsoever and he doesn't know what I will do in the future, if I will give him the same attention or not. 
So this is the game plan... I think I found the husband. I know what I want in terms of work. This year I will try to 
perfect my deal closing system, find out what I need to open a brokerage and set up referral streams. Get
