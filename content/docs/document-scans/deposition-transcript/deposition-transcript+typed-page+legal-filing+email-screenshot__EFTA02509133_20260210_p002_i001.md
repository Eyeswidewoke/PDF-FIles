having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordinat=on with Suydam Kathy Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one 
pe=son. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into considerat=on. 
TODAY 
With your=consent , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as c=nduit directly to me) , she continued to provide 
bad info to both =AO you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) =and me. and each time with my many 
annoying calls to you that she was g...=.y !! No one was hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no =ne was 
even interviewed and even now , Brad is not full=time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him 
. and=new staff. Eileen followed your instructions. not mine. in fact she=C2 continued to ignore mine saying " but Leon 
" its on&=uot; Leon's desk etc " , You would become =rustrated when i pointed out each instance. of her obfuscation. 
ori=inally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose=C2 not to hire my team . I was hired to do the 
architecture, you =ept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions w=re given by me, detailed but ignored by 
her. ( except in the insta=ces where I inserted myself and personally had to do the weeks of gr=nt work ),ex. jpm 
morgan acct still not i= use? that being said If you do the cold calculation sta=ting from where you were, to where you 
are currently . =ou had made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating down my =AO original amount requested , calling upon 
our friendship and =suggesting that the Carlyn mess was partially my fault. =AO ( though in that specific example , I had 
never been asked to do more t=an merely provide you the name of the most highly recognized =C2 atty in the field, not 
consulted,nor asked ag=in for my guidance along the way. ). I accepted=C2 the discount as your friend. ( by the 
way „suggesting =ow, that your Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, fra=kly is a bit much,-). however -
that is all in the past. =br> 
In order to move forward 
I wou=d ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business =AO is only comprised of my personal attention and 
my personal time=C2 . time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your va=ious issues last year. . As you are my 
very close friend I wil= not have you participate in a bidding process that I will have =AO this year for my time . 
(hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) =C2 I would also ask that you keep in mind that though our deal ex=ired months 
ago. (ekeeping in mind , that your understanding of the final=C2 terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we 
finished it up y=ur way. ) I have answered every call Brad , joslin, Ada =AO or you, have made . reviewed docs over and 
over/ until once=again, I was forced to insert myself strongly as I t=ought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar 
and time concession= last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some=of your concerns , but I 
am, under no circumstances , none, =AO willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carl=n's mess , 
which was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . =C2 We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
fou=d yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousne=s. and those very circumstances I took extra 
care in our negotiation= . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position =o be in with my very close 
friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are =ot very careful ,in the near future, another barrel will appear of your ow= 
design ) 
I heard you when you said you believe= i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art partne=ship 
has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all m= obligations. ( FYI Carlyns art par=nership that you 
referenced is only similar in only title. )4=pan>You will also recal= that you required that my payments be at the end 
of my work not at the be=inning as everyone else.( my work was never to include hours upon ho=rs of training your 
staff). I eventually agreed, this of=course should make clear that the 2014 tax year that wil= close Oct 2015 is not 
covered by our past agreement at all. I point=d this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreeme=t 
right out of the box. you said you preferred not. As you sai= ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of =ven my 
own exalted opinion of my projections. I have devoted a monumental =mount of my limited amount of time-- way, way 
in excess of our agree=ent. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still=outstanding from last year if that helps 
.. However, As my bes= student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing=most, if not all, of the required work 
yourself. I can p=t my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories=. share moments ideas 
etc.. I am of course always avai=able to guide you as a friend if you choose that route .. It will take a g=eat deal of 
your time , but you will not have to spend any mor= money on mine . 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , =A0I leave at 5 am sat morning.
