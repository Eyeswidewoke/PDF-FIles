Syria is Iran's main regional ally, and the longer the Syrian =ivil war rages the more disorder spreads in the region. Late 
last month Is=ael bombed a convoy carrying heavy weapons into Lebanon to help Israel's enemy and Iran's Shiite proxy, 
Hezbollah. A =uicker victory for the rebels backed by the U.S. two years ago might have =ut off Syria as a conduit for 
Iranian arms to Hezbollah and thus reduced t=e threat to Israel. 
The Petraeus-Clinton proposal speaks well of Mr. Obama's first=term security team but also raises more alarm about his 
second-term choice=. John Kerry, Chuck Hagel and John Brennan all lack the independent standing of Mrs. Clinton, Mr. 
Panetta and former =eneral Petraeus. They aren't likely to challenge Mr. Obama with views he d=esn't want to hear. 
U.S. military actio= other than drone warfare isn't in favor these days, but Syria is showing =ow doing nothing has costs 
of its own. In overruling his advisers, Mr. Oba=a has prolonged Syria's civil war, increased regional instability, and 
delivered a strategic gift to Iran, th= main enemy of Israel and the U.S.

February 10, 2013 -= Two years ago, on Feb. 11, 2011, the Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak 
chttp://topics.wsj.com/person/M/Hosni-Mubarak/6479> stepped aside, overwhelmed by 18 days of protes=s. Silent 
and remote, he had ruled for three decades. He had offered his countrymen—and powers beyond—the sol= gift of 
stability. He was a gendarme on the banks of the Nile. Now his co=ntry was done with him, and the vaunted stability of 
his near 30-year reig= was torn asunder. 
Yet it is only against the backdrop of the sordid political la=dscape of today's Egypt—the hooliganism of the young, the 
lawlessness, t=e fault line between a feeble secular camp and a cynical Muslim Brotherhood bent on monopolizing 
political power—th=t the true work of the Mubarak tyranny can be fully appreciated. The "=deep state" he presided 
over—a Ministry of Interior with nearly two=million functionaries, a police force that ran amok—is Mubarak's true 
legacy. 
The disorder today in Egypt's streets is taken by some as proo= that the despot knew what he was doing, and that 
Egyptians are innately g=ven to tyranny. But that view misses the damage that this man and his greedy family and 
retainers inflicted on = nation of more than 80 million people that once had nobler ideas of its p=ace in the world. 
Grant the Egyptian =eople credit for their mercy and forbearance. The Pharaoh was deposed and =is two sons, who sat 
astride the country's economy and politics, were haul=d off to prison, but they were spared the gruesome end that was 
meted out next door to Moammar Gadhafi. A sickly=Mubarak was humbled, wheeled into court on a gurney. But he was 
not sent t= the gallows. True, some of the families of victims struck down during the=upheaval howled for his blood. But 
the day of his reckoning was deferred as the judiciary let the matter =un in the hope that the aged former ruler would 
succumb to a natural death=
