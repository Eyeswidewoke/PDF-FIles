As I said earlier, the Control Factor is "active" and "continuous" so we must constantly monitor 
and combat it. Like "Whack-a-Mole," just as we may think we have addressed it, another variation pops right up. I use 
the terms "addict" and "enabler" because we truly need a form of rehab to break the habitual power of the Control 
Factor and because our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a typical addict and his 
enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler act essentially addicted to his 
behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship involves the transfer of responsibility for our 
Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant actions onto us with our response framed essentially as an effort to do what we can 
to try to address the Enemy's grievance. (Your book, United in Hate <http://www.amazon.com/United-Hate-Romance-
Tyranny-Terror/dp/1935071602/ref=sr_1_12s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357362028&sr=1-1&keywords=united+in+hate> , 
describes this addiction to hate in detail. 
The key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and 
resultant actions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can about the 
enemy. We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are not. We 
must speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are consistent with our 
principles. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its intrusion. This is an individual endeavor 
as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book gives plenty of examples of each maneuver discussed but 
it is important for each of us to discover the unique workings of his own mind. That takes the work of the Inner Jihad. 
FP: Share with our readers what you mean by the "Turnaround Moment." 
Siegel: There is a moment in typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed 
to their limit. They then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthless as the threat they face. No more 
moral high ground; no more futile attempts to ignore or change the threat's essence. As Lee Harris described in The 
Suicide of Reason <http://www.amazon.com/Suicide-Reason-Radical-Islams-
Threat/dp/B001G7R9NW/ref=sr_l_l?s=books&ierUTF8&qid=1360128507&sr=1-
1&keywords=lee+harris+suic%20ide+of+reason> , it is the willingness o r license to be (not necessarily actually being) as 
ruthless that is critical. It is a mental state that sheds all the prior counter-productive efforts at denial to finally clearly 
focus on the threat faced. Part of the Inner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner rather than later. 
FP: You suggest that "mirroring" should be used as part of our arsenal. Tell us about it. 
Siegel: Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict responsibility that we 
have been inappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict/enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like the addict, the enemy 
uses a less limiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates aggression while we respond only. Mirroring 
means that we demonstrate our willingness to act symmetrically, to be governed by the same rules. It is stunning how 
much is accomplished when one's attitude simply is clear that he will do what is necessary; often not much else is 
needed as the addict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally changed. But other times action is absolutely needed. 
Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat the enemy as it treats us carries great meaning. Imagine (international law 
aside) if Israel announced that from now on it will mirror Hamas such that if civilian populations are targeted by bombs 
from Gaza, Israel will do the same (it is accused of such anyway). The population might finally rethink and take 
responsibility for its privilege of voting its leaders. As stated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we mirror we 
teach the other the effects of his behavior. 
Conversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases where it is 
necessary to highlight our differences with the enemy. Just this week, an disingenuous report was issued by an NGO 
drawing an equivalence between Palestinian and Israe li schoolbooks claiming that both sides have their relativistic " 
narratives." Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch <http://www.palwatch.org/>'s website has demonstrated for years, 
there is nothing in the West anywhere comparable to the hatred spewed daily by the Palestinian Authority, including 
through its education system. It is interesting to note that while the US State Department initially funded the "study,"- in 
what appears to be an attempt to sanitize the PA's record so that the US can continue to fund the PA against the spirit of 
US law- Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escaping her conclusion as Senator in 2007 that these schoolbooks along with
