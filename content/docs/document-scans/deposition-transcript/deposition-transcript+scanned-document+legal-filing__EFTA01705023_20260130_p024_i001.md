Points Advance 
Effective July 3, 2007, the Points Advance feature will become available. Through a Points Advance, eligible Cardmembers may obtain and 
use points in advance of accruing them in their program accounts. Accordingly, on that date the following new section is added to the program 
Terms & Conditions: 
'Points Advance 
1. Through a Points Advance, you may obtain and use up to 60,000 points in advance of accruing them in your program account. You 
may request a Paints Advance only in connection with a conversion of points to a participating Frequent Customer Program or 
redemption of points for a reward. You may obtain a Points Advance only for your own program account. We may decline any request 
for a Points Advance. 2. Linked Accounts or Cards that are eligible to obtain Points Advance are referred to in this section as Points 
Advance-eligible Linked Accounts." Corporate Cardmembers and Additional Business Cardmembers having only those Cards enrolled 
in the program are not eligible to obtain a Points Advance. You must have had a Card account for at least 6 months, and all of your 
Linked Accounts must be in good standing, to obtain a Points Advance. 3. You may not obtain a Points Advance in connection with the 
following transactions: payment of the federal excise tax fee disclosed in paragraph 2 of the Frequent Customer Programs section of 
these Terms & Conditions; a Redemption for Cash; transactions which may be paid with a point redemption, including Pay with Points 
and Shop Amex transactions; and any redemption for a reward subject to the Hotel Properties, Cruises and Vacation Packages section of 
these Terms & Conditions. We may advise you of additional ineligible transactions at the time you seek a Points Advance. 4. You may 
obtain a Points Advance only If you have insufficient points in your program account for your desired conversion or redemption 
transaction. The number of points you may obtain in a Points Advance Is equal to the difference between the number of points required 
for your desired conversion or redemption transaction and the number of points you have accrued in your program account, up to your 
Points Advance limit. You may obtain more than one Points Advance, provided that the total of your outstanding Points Advances may 
never exceed 60,000 points. If you wish to accomplish a redemption or conversion transaction using a Purchase Points transaction 
and/or reinstated points together with a Points Advance, you must complete the Purchase Points transaction and/or the point 
reinstatement before you request a Points Advance. 5. You must accrue points in your program account in an amount equal to a Points 
Advance within 12 months of the date that you received that Points Advance. Any portion of a Points Advance for which you have not 
accrued points within that period will be charged to a Points Advance-eligible Linked Account of yours at the rate charged for a Purchase 
Points transaction on the date that you received the Points Advance. Please remember that there is a delay between when you make 
eligible charges on a Linked Account and when you accrue points attributable to those charges in your program account. Points which 
accrue in your program account after a Points Advance maturity date will not apply toward satisfaction of that Points Advance, even if the 
charges for which those points accrue were made prior to that maturity date. If you have more than one Points Advance outstanding, 
points accrued in your program account will be applied first towards the oldest outstanding Points Advance. 6. If you return a reward for 
which you redeemed using points obtained through a Points Advance, the points you are credited in connection with that retum will be 
applied first towards that Points Advance. If you have already accrued points in an amount equal to that Points Advance, then the points 
you are credited will be applied toward your oldest outstanding Points Advance, if any. Otherwise, the points will be credited to your 
program account. 7. If you have an outstanding Points Advance at the time that your enrollment in the program is cancelled for any 
reason or that ap of your Points Advance-eligible Linked Accounts are cancelled for any reason, the portion of that Points Advance for 
which you have not accrued points will be charged to a Points Advance-eligible Linked Account of yours at the rate charged for a 
Purchase Points transaction on the date that you received the Points Advance. You will be charged for the unsatisfied portion of the 
Points Advance even if you still have Linked Accounts or Cards that are not Points Advance-eligible Linked Accounts. 8. You may be 
offered promotional opportunities to earn bonus points. There may be a delay between when you engage in the activity qualifying you to 
receive bonus points and when the bonus points are credited to your program account. Bonus points which are credited to your program 
account after a Points Advance maturity date will not apply toward satisfaction of that Points Advance, even if you engaged In the activity 
qualifying you to receive the bonus points prior to that maturity date.'
