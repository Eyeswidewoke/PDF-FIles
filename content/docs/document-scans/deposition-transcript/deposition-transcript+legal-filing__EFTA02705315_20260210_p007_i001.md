SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS 
The M600/6 is a flexible amplifier, well-suited 
for a multitude of system configurations. In 
this section. the most likely configurations are 
explained in detail. 
Once you have selected your desired 
configuration, you can use the amplifier panel 
drawing on pages 18 & 19 to mark the required 
switch positions for easy reference. 
BkAMPLIFIED SYSTEMS 
Ili-amplified systems are defined as systems 
in which separate amplifier channels drive low-
frequency (I.F) and high-frequency (HF) speakers 
and are separately filtered to send appropriate 
frequency ranges to each speaker system. 
The most common application of 
hi-amplification in marine audio is to drive a 
subwoofer system from one or more amplifiers or 
channels and component speakers from separate 
amplifier; or channels. 
The M600/6 is designed to work as the only 
amplifier in a bi-amplified system. 
System with the M600/6 
In this configuration, channels 5&6 of the 
M600/6 will drive subwoofers (stereo 75W x 2 at 
4 ohms, 100W x 2 at 2 ohms, or bridged 200W x 1 
at 4 ohms) with low-pass filtering. Channels l&2 
and channels 3&4 will drive component speakers 
in stereo (75W x 4 at 4 ohms or 100W x 2 at 2 
ohms) with high-pass filtering. 
Input connection options for a bi-amplified system 
with one M60016 arc as follows: 
A) No User Adiustabithy: 
Required: a basic source unit or processor 
with one pair of stereo outputs. 
Input Connections: a single pair of stereo source 
unit outputs is connected to the "Ch I" and "Ch 
2" inputs of the M600/6. Then, select "2 eh: on 
the M600/6's "Input Mode' switch. 
Result: the relative level of the LF and HF 
channels will be fixed by the M600/6's "Input 
Sens.' settings and will not be user adjustable 
from the helm (unless an optional HD.RLC is 
connected the "Remote Level Control' port 
and used as a subwoofer level control). 
B) Fade Front vs. Rear with no Subwoofer 
erriconuol. 
Required: a basic source unit or processor with 
two pain of stereo outputs. 
Input Connections: one pair of stereo source unit 
outputs is connected to the "CH I (Left)" and 
"CH 2 (Right)" inputs and the second pair 
of stereo source unit outputs is connected 
to the "CH 3 (Left)" and "CH 4 (Right)" 
inputs of the M600/6 (select "4 Ch: on the 
'Input Mode' switch in the "Channel 5 & 6 
Controls" section). 
Result: the relative level of the I.F and HF 
channels will be fixed by the M600/6's "Input 
Sens: settings and will not be user adjustable 
from the helm. but the user will be able to fade 
the signal from front to rear. 
An optional HD-RLC can be connected the 
"Remote Level Control' port and used as a 
subwoofer level control. if desired. 
C) Fade Subwoofer Level vs. HF Level: 
Required: a basic source unit or processor with 
two pairs of state outputs. 
Input Connections: the first stereo pair of source 
unit outputs each split with a "Y-Adaptor" 
allowing the kft signal to be sent to the 'CH 
I (Left)" and 'CH 3 (Left)" inputs and the 
right signal to be sent to the "CH 2 (Right)" 
and 'CH 4 (Right)" inputs of the M600/6. 
The second stereo pair of source unit outputs 
is connected to the "CH 5 (Left)" and "CH 6 
(Right)" inputs (select "6 Ch: on the 'Input 
Mode" switch). 
Result: in this mode. the user has the ability to 
fade or control the level of the LF channels 
relative to the HF channels via the source 
unit's fader control without exceeding the 
maximum clean output level set by each 
amplifier section's "Input Sens." controls. 
ID) Subwoofer Level Control Only: 
Required: a source unit or processor with 
one pair of stereo outputs and dedicated 
subwoofer outputs. 
Input Connections: the stereo pair of source 
unit outputs each split with a "T-Adaptor" 
allowing the kit signal to be sent to the "CH 
I (Left)" and "C113 (Left)" inputs and the 
right signal to be sent to the 'CH 2 (Right)" 
and "CH 4 (Right)" Inputs of the M60016. The 
source unit's dedicated subwoofer outputs arc 
connected to the "CH 5 (Left)" and 
"CH 6 (Right)" inputs (select "6 Ch." on the 
"Input Mode" switch in the "Channel 5 & 6 
Controls" section). 
Result: in this mode, the user has the ability to 
control the absolute level of the I.F channels 
relative to the HF channels.

Required: a source unit or processor with 
two pairs of stereo outputs and dedicated 
subwoofer outputs. 
Input Connections: one pair of stereo source 
unit outputs is connected to the "CH I (Left)" 
and "CH 2 (Right)" inputs, the second pair of 
stereo source unit outputs is connected to the 
"CH 1 (Left)" and "CH 4 (Right)" inputs and 
the source unit's dedicated subwoofer output 
is connected to the "CH 5 (Left)" and 'CH 6 
(Right)" inputs (select -6 Ch.- on the "Input 
Mode" switch. 
Result: in this mode. the user has the ability to 
control the absolute level of the LF channels as 
well as both pairs of HF channels. 
BIMPORTANT
When using a source unit's dedicated 
subwoofer output, set the "Input Sens." of any 
channels receiving input from the subwoofer 
output with the source unit's subwoofer level 
control set at 3/4 of full output. See Appendix A 
(page 14) for details. 
Crossover Setup for RI-Amplified System 
with one M600/& 
Once the input sections have been configured 
appropriately. go to the "Channels & 6 
Controls". Select "LP" (low-pass) on the "Filter 
Mode" switch and an appropriate "Filter Freq." 
(80 Hz is a good starting point). 
Next, turn your attention to the "Channel I & 
2 Controls and "Channel 3 & 4 Controls" and 
select "HP" (high.pass) on the "Filter Mode" 
switches and an appropriate "Filter Freq." (again. 
80 Hz is a good starting point). 
After proper adjustment of the "Input 
Sens." controls fa all three channel pairs 
using the method shown in Appendix A 
(page 14), you can fine tune filter frequencies 
and attenuate any pair of channels to achieve 
proper balance. For precise filter frequency 
information refer to Appendix B (page 15).
