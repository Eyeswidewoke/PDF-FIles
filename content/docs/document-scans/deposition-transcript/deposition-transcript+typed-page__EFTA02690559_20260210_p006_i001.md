religious affiliations of her extended family. They run the gamut from Sunni to 
Shia to Christian. We traveled outside of the Green Zone, into the so called Red 
Zone on several occasions. We went into the Palestine hotel (Red Zone of 
Baghdad) and had tea with the deputy general manager. 
We went into a 
convenience shop and bought cokes and stopped for bread in the store next 
door. The market was interesting because the predominant items were 
refrigerators, air conditioners and generators. This is new and suggests that 
people who can afford these things are now staying in Iraq instead of fleeing. 
We stopped in the district where nightlife used to thrive. More recently it was the 
launching pad for Al Qaeda's rockets into the Green Zone. We walked in the 
park. We found a guy working on a Friday. He explained that he was building a 
fish restaurant and was happy to show us what he was doing. He then invited us 
to lunch (we had to decline), but was clearly engaged and optimistic that he can 
make money in his new restaurant. Baghdad is now a walled city. Huge 
concrete security walls have been erected throughout Baghdad. It makes for a 
weird experience because you cannot see any cityscape. It is like living in a 
series of tunnels. These walls have been critical to our success in securing 
neighborhoods, but they must come down in order to give a sense of normalcy to 
the people of Baghdad.

Final Thoughts: What is going on in Iraq has great potential, but 
also holds great risks. The potential is for the creation of a stable Arab country 
whose population is able to hold its leaders accountable and whose leaders will 
need to focus on creating prosperity and hope for their people. Further, that 
path could bring Iraq into the big leagues (along with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Abu 
Dhabi, Russia etc.) in terms of energy production. All of that could be a game 
changer in terms of global geopolitics. There are huge risks attendant to this 
strategy. One can paint a myriad of dangerous scenarios. In addition to failing 
to pacify Iraq, one could envision our strategy resulting in the destabilization of 
Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria and others. From a risk / reward scenario, the strategy 
seems to be one of high risks, but attendant very high rewards should it 
succeed. Today, that risk / reward calculus is certainly much more attractive 
than it was in 2002 when the decision was made to go into Iraq. Real and 
tangible progress can finally be documented. There is a sense that we have 
turned the corner and that this could be a big win. This sense is only a few 
months old so no one is banking on it at this point. At the same time, it is my 
impression that the American public is lagging in their perception of the situation 
and the incredible improvements that have taken place since the beginning of 
this year. There have been material gains in three areas: i) The neighborhood. 
People now want to get rid of the insurgents and Al Qaeda. They see their 
interests in building a stable Iraq and they are increasingly supporting our 
mission. If the people continue to buy into the program of a stable democratic 
Iraq, we have accomplished a lot. ii) The Iraqi army. It is beginning to coalesce 
into a functioning force; and iii) The governance system. With three elections 
under its belt, it is beginning to feel like a national government. An important 
Sunni party just agreed to join the government. This furthers the evolution of a
