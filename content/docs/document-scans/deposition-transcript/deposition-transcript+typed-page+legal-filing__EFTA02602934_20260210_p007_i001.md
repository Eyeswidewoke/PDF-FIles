hour care, and I was in no position to think about such =atters. If I had been informed -- I don't recall anything of 
the=sort -- I couldn't have paid any attention or granted truly informed consent. So I would like to learn more about 
=hese decisions. 
Secondly, I don't understand them. H=w could the Cape and Lexington homes fund the Trust? Did the funds 
f=om selling the Lexington house go to the Trust? How was it funded be=ore. Would appreciate clarification on this. 
Of course we knew by then that she would prede=ease me. It was a medical miracle that she was able to 
survive that =ong, on experimental drugs, as a last resort. 
The records that I have seen do not indicate what your expectations (or Carol's) were as to =ow the Marital 
Trusts were to be made available to you after Carol was gon= — for that the independent trustee of the trusts (whether 
me or m= successor) has to rely on the terms of the trusts themselves, the information that's given by the trust 
beneficiarie=, and the law surrounding such trusts. 
I'd be interested, of course, in knowing abou= the records you have seen, but it would hardly be surprising if 
there is =o explicit record of what is obvious simply to common sense. We were a married couple who cared for each 
other and for our children, pu=ting a Trust in Carol's name for tax purposes. What sort of luna=y would it to set up a 
Trust for one of us to have access to but not the o=her? So of course you are unlikely to find notes about it. If Harry 
forces this to litigation, all of this will=have to come up, either in court or in public in some other manner.=/b> 
When I appointed Harry to replace me as trust=e, I took for granted that he would handle the trust as I had. His 
b=havior since, and this latest proposal, make it very clear how wrong that assumption was. This proposal calls for him 
to be in =omplete charge, which means, as he has shown, that I can only plead for so=e funds by accepting conditions 
that he knows I will not accept. You=recall, I presume, that this was true even when I faced an enormous tax bill 
because my IRA was being depleted for th= benefit of the family. 
To refresh your memory, let me repeat again w=at was happening with my IRA until I learned about it. There is 
a ma=datory withdrawal. Half was being distributed to family. The other half was being used for taxes and 
management fees for the entire=estate. In order to pay Alex's medical expenses, and to pay $50,=00 a year for rent and 
upkeep on the house in Wellfleet that we had given =o the children and that I was barely using, I had to withdraw extra 
funds from the IRA, with the onerous tax burden.=C2 The same when I withdrew something to live on. Under these 
cir=umstances, Harry refused to release funds from the Trust for tax relief wi=hout onerous and humiliating conditions 
that he knew I would not accept. Easy to predict what might happen under =ess extreme conditions. It was not until 
2017 that I was able to ove=come the accumulated burden of these actions. 
In the previous paragraph you offer to "refresh my mem=ry" and in the prior paragraph you say "You recall, I 
pres=me ". Without going into detail, I have to note th=t my recollection of the events you describe is not consistent 
with yours (though it may not be ent=rely consistent with Harry's either — I am not sure). =A0 
In my case it is not recollections. When I =egan to understand what was happening, I looked into the matter, 
and have =he documents at hand, including the mail interchanges about Harry's refusal. The rest is straightforward and 
unambiguous doc=ments. 
Since my own recollections may be the subject of testimo=y in the legal proceeding that Harry has initiated, or 
in one that you may=commence, I think it better that I not recite my own recollections here. 
Note that Harry's exhibit B, beginning wi=h section 9, is utterly false, and consciously so. All of the above has 
be=n explained to him over and over. It is not only consciously false, but is framed as a vicious and ugly attack on 
Valeria, implicitly a=cusing her of responsibility for the escalation of expenses which, as Harr= knows, was caused by the 
actions just described once again. c=span>
