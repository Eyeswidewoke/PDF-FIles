For purposes of the Portfolio Profile Test, unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise 
provided in the Portfolio Profile Test. a Synthetic Security will be deemed to have the characteristics of the related 
Reference Obligation (except that the Moody's Assigned Rating, the Moody's Recovery Rate and the S&P 
Recover Rate for the Synthetic Security will be used). 
The Coverage Tests 
The Coverage Tests will be used primarily to determine whether, on each Payment Date. principal and 
interest may be paid on the Senior Notes and distributions may be made on the Income Notes or whether funds 
which would otherwise be used to pay interest (and, in certain cases. principal) on the Senior Notes other than the 
Class A Notes and to make distributions on the Income Notes must instead be used to pay principal on one or more 
Classes of Senior Notes according to the priorities referred to in "Description of the Notes—Priority of Payments.-

Classes of Senior Notes will be performed as of each Measurement Date beginning on or. in the case of the Interest 
Coverage Test, following. the Determination Date relating to the first Payment Date following the Ramp-Up Period. 
The Overcollateralization Test and the Interest Coverage Test for a designated Class or Classes of Notes will be 
satisfied as of am• Measurement Date if the applicable Overcollateralization Ratio or Interest Coverage Ratio. 
respectively, is at least equal to the required ratio indicated below. If the Coverage Tests are not satisfied with 
respect to any applicable Payment Date occurring subsequent to the Ramp-Up Period, the Issuer will be required to 
apply available amounts on such Payment Date in the Payment Account to make payments of principal on Notes

or enter into binding agreements to purchase additional Collateral Obligations that, together with the Collateral 
Obligations purchased on or before the Closing Date (the "Initial Collateral Obligations"), satisfy as of the end of 
the Ramp-Up Period the Portfolio Profile Test, the Collateral Quality Test and the Coverage Tests and have an 
Aggregate Principal Balance of at least $450,000,000 (including any prepayments on Collateral Obligations and sale 
proceeds of Collateral Obligations that in either case have not yet been reinvested in Collateral Obligations) 
(collectively, the "Ramp-Up Period Criteria").
