RE: comments by Joerg Friese the owner of the Stella Mans Resort 
Dear Jeffrey, 
here is an answer to your concerns from Joerg Friese the owner of the Stell= Maris Resort, who had the following 
comments concerning your fears,  
Hi, Eduardo: I have to say to this the following: Stella Maris land allows utterly safe choices of locations for setting up 
anything physical — and =he right way to build will withstand hurricanes. I myself prefer to have to accept the possibility 
of occasional hurricane developments any time, befor= I would agree to contend with earthquakes, large forest fires, 
floods, and tornadoes! We have been through five "real" hurricanes over 50 years, =nd NONE of them had caused 
major damage! The damages of Long Island occurred where over hundreds of years little west-sea-side settlements and 
towns hugged what was then the 'easy' west shore, for transportation, but low-lying! It is to be hoped that this fact now 
provides a chance down Sout= for re-building where one should = on safe land! There is plenty of it! W= ourselves, as all 
of Stella Maris, had no damage — with the exception of = few roofing shingles and one part of a roof, stone-age old, 
which just sailed with the wind. The owner of this building sees this as an opportunit= to make over his house "better". 
Best regards, Joerg. 
He sees the hurricane as an opportunity to learn how to build and where to =uild, no deaths reported so far in LI as far 
as we know, really it does compare to the earthquakes in Chile for example. Valdivia was totally destr=yed in the 60s by 
an earthquake, with thousands of casualties and now hol=s a nice physics center, here in Israel we have terrorism, 
which does not =eems to be an obstacle for doing physics, California is also no stranger t= natural disasters, but there 
you have so many physics centers... 
all the best, 
Eduardo

Dear Jeffrey, 
here is an answer to your concerns from the representative of the company w= were thinking that should build the 
center, Richard Keyworth, who had th= following comments concerning your fears, 
Hi Eduardo, 
It is easy to make assumptions following the media reports on Long Island, which have focussed on the damage, 
obviously. I think we can easily allay M= Epstein's fears, once he realises the type and location of the major damage=and 
the property involved. A lot of the damage was caused by a storm surge to v=ry low lying properties. This will be of no 
concern on the land we have in min= at Stella Mans Village which is on high ground. Also the direct high wind dam=ge 
was to property with a less robust construction. The new Center, along with=all our new builds at Stella Mans Village are 
built to Category 5 hurricane standard. Our recently constructed new show home has suffered no structural damage at 
all during the storm.
