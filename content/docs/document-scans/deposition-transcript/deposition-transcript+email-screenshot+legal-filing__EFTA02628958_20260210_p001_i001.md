Books and newspaper accounts of Trump's 45 years in business were full of=his shady dealings, and the 
presidency had only helped to highlight them and to surfa=e even juicier ones. Real estate was the world's favorite 
money laundering cur.ency and Trump's perceived A -level real estate business was quite explicit,= designed to appeal 
to money launderers. What's more, Trump's own financ=al woes, and desperate efforts to maintain billionaire lifestyle, 
cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle schemes. Practically=speaking, you couldn't miss 
him, as the Mueller investigation appeared to be finding. 
In November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein= the financier later caught in a scandal involving under-age prostitutes, 
agreed=to buy out of bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, Florida for $36 million=E2 a house that had been on the 
market for two years. Epstein and Trump had been close frie=ds—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, 
with Trump always hopef=l that Epstein would provide some of his financial expertise to enabvle h8=m to survive . 
Trump was beholden to Deutsch Bank and was on the ho=k personally for 40 million dollars. 
Epstein took Trump to see the Pal= Beach house to advise him on construction issues involved with moving the 
swimmin= pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the house, an incredulous Epstein saw a s=verely cash-constrained 
Trump bid $41 million for the property, buying it through =n entity named Trump Properties LLC, ultimate owner 
unknown. . Trump, Epstein knew, had been in the buisness of leasing his name. Hotels are actual=y owned by others but 
renting the trump name would cost a percent or two.=C2 , Trump was willing to serve as a front man to disguise the 
actual ownership in a real estate transaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of Trump's basic business model 
of licensing his name for=commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furious Epstein suspected that others 
actually ow=ed the new house. then getting extensive scrutiny in Florida papers. The d=sagreement re the purchase of 
the house became all the more bitter when, two months later, the house was put on the market for $125 million. Well 
known to Trump, who often visited with Epstein at =is Palm Beach house, whose visits were confirmed in depostions of 
Epsteins houseman= It appears that Epstein was visited almost every day, by and had been for=many years, by girls who 
he paid for massages with happy endings—girls recruite=, and who often returned to his house from the local mas=age 
parlors strip clubs, and, also, Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Just as th= threats and enmity of the two friends increased over the 
house sale, Epstein found himself under investigation by local Palm Beach police. Epstein's l=gal problems vastly 
escalated but the new Trump property , with only minor impr=vements, was bought 3 years later in 08 , the time 
Trump was facing his huge debt. for $9= million by Dmitry Rybolovlev. a Russain oligarch. That is, Trump ha= either 
miraculously earned $55 million, without putting up a dime, or Rybolovlev, or someone su=h as Rybolovlev, paid Trump 
Properties, LLC—actual owner unknown =80 $96 million, thereby providing a clean payment of $55 million to someone. 
This at =he very same time that trump was into Deutsch bank for over 600 million do=lars but with a 40 millino personal
