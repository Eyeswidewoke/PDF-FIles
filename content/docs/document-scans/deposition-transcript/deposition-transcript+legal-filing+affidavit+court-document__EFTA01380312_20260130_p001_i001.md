after due inquiry and to the best knowledge and belief of Intel and Purchaser, any of the persons listed in 
Schedule I to this Offer to Purchase, on the one hand, and Mobileye or its affiliates, on the other hand. 
concerning a merger. consolidation or acquisition. tender offer. or other acquisition of any class of Mobileye's

Source and Amount of Funds. 
The Offer is not conditioned upon Purchaser obtaining financing to fund the purchase of Shares pursuant to 
the Offer and to fund the Post-Offer Reorganization. We believe the financial condition of Purchaser is not 
material to a decision by a holder of Shares whether to sell, hold, or tender Shares pursuant to the Offer because 
(a) the Offer is being made for all outstanding Shares solely for cash. (b) we will have access to unrestricted cash 
and cash equivalents of our affiliates. which we anticipate being sufficient to purchase all Shares tendered 
pursuant to the Offer and to complete the Past-Offer Reorganization, (c) the Offer is not subject to any financing 
condition, and (d) if we consummate the Offer and not all outstanding Shares are tendered pursuant to the Offer 
or during the Subsequent Offering Period (as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period). we or 
Intel may elect to effectuate or cause to be effectuated the Post-Offer Reorganization, in part, based on the 
number of Shares held by us and our affiliates following the Subsequent Offering Period (as it may be extended 
by the Minority Exit Offering Period). including (but not limited to) by (i) acquiring all assets of Mobileye in the 
Asset Sale and, following the consummation of the Asset Sale, dissolving and liquidating Mobileye in 
accordance with applicable Dutch procedures. such that non-tendering Mobileye shareholders will receive the 
Offer Consideration (without interest and Tess applicable withholding taxes) as the Second Step Distribution, or 
(ii) commencing the Compulsory Acquisition. In the event that the Compulsory Acquisition is implemented, then 
the Dutch Court will determine the price to be paid for the non-tendered Shares. Although Intel and Purchaser 
will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the per Share price paid in the Compulsory Acquisition for the non-
tendered Shares to be equal to the Offer Consideration, such price may be greater than, equal to. or less than the 
Offer Consideration. Such price may potentially be increased by the Dutch Statutory Interest. 
We estimate that the total amount of funds required for Purchaser to purchase all outstanding Shares in the 
Offer and to consummate the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and to pay related 
transaction fees and expenses. will be approximately $15 billion. We anticipate finding such cash requirements 
from available cash and cash equivalents of Intel and its subsidiaries.
