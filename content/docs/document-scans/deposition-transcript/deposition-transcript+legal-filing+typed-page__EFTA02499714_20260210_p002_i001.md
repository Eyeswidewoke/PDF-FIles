Isle of man — please see atta=hed Moore Stephens memo re Isle of Man VAT registration. I will conf=rm 
with Captain Sputh that Isle of Man was chosen for VAT registration. =AO Also attached is memo PW paralegal wrote on 
BJAV which provides br=ad summary. Captain was contacted yesterday/ afternoon a=d I will look to speak to him 
today. He is on GMT time. Attached is a sampling of invoices. No invoices have ever been sent =r mailed to 760 Park. 
All invoices come to family office via email from Captain Sputh. Sputh has had vendor relationships for many years =nd 
some date back to Carl Ichan (CCI) ownership . I will confirm with Captain Sputh how he receives invoices.=C2 I 
assembled 30 invoices for your perusal. Some invoices are cl=arly emailed only as there is no address. Some use dock 
where boat i= berthed. Some use CCI address of 767 Fifth Ave. Some use Captain South's address in Florida. Many use 
Cayman and Islerof Man addresses. A few use 760 Park. As for charters, S=uth has continued to use the same form as 
when used when captain for CCI.=C2 Generally the address used is 760 Park or 445 Park. =AO Note that CCI charters 
used CCI address on Fifth Ave. See attached page o=e for CCI charter and two recent BJAV charters. I will look to discuss 
wit= Sputh today the invoice address and the charter address. I asked EA=for color on use of 760 Park and her review of 
her files was a dead end. 
For construction of SH Meadow (bay ho=se) , we are capitalizing into basis. We value this property at 
tax basis on our books. For the townhouse we are doing same. =AO We have these invoices and as such we review each 
to determine ca=ital vs expense. For other real estate we have valued based on=valuation guidance provided by JEE 
and/ or EA/ BJW. For invoices that we have access or have collected, we have capitalized but value the p=operty rather 
than use tax basis (books). Miriam had analyzed =60 improvements based on her records over the past several years 
and she d=d not find a material amount. A more detailed review is warranted for determining gain the 760 Park coop is 
sold.=C2 A project that needs to be completed is compiling all invoices for t=e Field House construction and derive a tax 
basis. Also the in=urance reimbursement information will be needed. 
Trading — Entity was cr=ated yesterday by PW. PW/ Ada are working on LLC agreement. 
JPM has not sent all docs for trading=via an LLC. They were to send option doc last night. I also asked 
them to prefill the docs with the entity name. I am scheduling=a call with them today to go over the form completion. 
DB has sent account=opening docs for an entity with entity name pre-filled. They will come to =ur offices to review 
today. Samantha is assisting on the form completion. Plan is to submit to JPM and DB=this Wednesday with BJW 
signature. KYC will follow once LLC ag=eement is provided. ISDA/ CSA will follow account opening.=/u> 
Plane depreciation: Not completed. =AO We are putting Avioneta books FY 2014 in order to reflect a) 
chartering under 135 starting mid-year b) retro-active reimbursements from Apollo =AO c) chartring palne to Jet as part 
of 135 operations. I need to si= down with Tom to review the prior year depreciation. His initial ta=e was that he was 
not comfortable claiming depreciation for any period that there was not charter operations.=/p> 
April books — we prepare comp=site financials quarterly where we eliminate intercompany loans, roll up 
holding LLC's into a composite look thru, mark all securities a=d positions to market. For non-quarter end, we can 
provide stand alo=e financials. Let's discuss with BJW.=/u>
