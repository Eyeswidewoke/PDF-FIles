I learned a lot this weekend. It was a very dynamic seminar. I'll try to keep this short. 
One of the core things I learned is to raise my standards. Nothing can get better until you do. It's 
like a muscle, first you lift 601b and its ok then go to 100 120 140and eventually 160 is easy. It 
applies to everything business, relationships, health, how I spend my time. 
Another thing is to cut the bullshit, stop assumptions and excuses. Just state facts without the 
story, this will cut the complexity of events in half. 
Something else I learned is visualization. Your brain can't tell the difference between something 
real and imagined. For example if I see myself talking a client and closing in detail, in my brain it 
already happened. When I talk to the client in reality for me it happens for the second time so I am 
more confident. 
There were a lot of useful exercises but one of the most amazing things that I experienced is that I 
felt at home. My goal was always to be among positive high achieving people that define the odds 
and ignore bullshit. At the seminar I was in a room of thousands people like that, the energy was 
amazing. This is the kind of people I would like to be around. 
What did I take from the seminar that I can apply right away? I stopped taking medicine for 
depression and I feel great. I know you don't approve of this, but I don't need it anymore and 
there is no way I will take it just to be comfortable. I have 5 specific things I will do to improve 
my business and give it a kick in the slow winter season. I am starting to exercise finally (never 
did in my life consistently). I am very excited to do it. I figured out the way that it could be fun. I 
am going to watch my diet for the next 2 weeks and do my best to up my energy and drop 15lb 
(vegetables, low sugar fruit and fish), nothing else. I am raising my standards at work (do more 
advertising, 10 cl a day, 40 ny times, qualify differently and spend 15 to 20% on proactive stuff) 
This means going after new landlords, getting exclusives, experimenting with flyers on campuses, 
corporate and student accounts. 
I thought it might be a good idea to experiment w having a good boyfriend relationship. I really 
like this guy Gregg. I could many him. Not that 1 want to. He is great but he is a B4- I want an A 
plus. He is better than anyone I dated in year but still not quite right long term, although I really 
enjoy spending time with him. So I thought at first " he is a little boring", then I realize NO I am 
boring. If I want to make it fun, I have to bring it. I think it's good practice for the future to try to 
make a happy fun relationship. By the way I went to my mom's bday and everyone there told me I 
don't look a day over 21. I realize it's brooklyn and its more like 24 by manhattan standards, but 
regardless I look young and hot and improving. It helps that I don't take myself too seriously and 
have fun. 
So much for keeping this short... It is actually very soothing to write to you. It's like keeping a 
journal. Mostly I feel like I am doing it for myself because you don't answer! That's ok, at least I 
know you read it.
