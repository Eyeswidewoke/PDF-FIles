Republicans run rampant on their platforms." The Washington Free Beacon (10/19, Piro, 78K) 
reports Twitter and Facebook "suppressed the circulation of the New York Post's reporting about 
a trove of emails and documents from a laptop allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden." According 
to Cruz, "This poses the single greatest threat to free speech in America today. It poses the 
single greatest threat to democracy in America today." 
Former Senior US Intelligence Officials Claim Emails Have "Classic Earmarks Of A 
Russian Information Operation." Politico (10/19, Bertrand, 4.29M) reports that more than 
50 former US senior intelligence officials "signed on to a letter outlining their belief that the 
recent disclosure of emails allegedly belonging to Joe Biden's son 'has all the classic earmarks 
of a Russian information operation." Politico adds that while the signatories "presented no new 
evidence, they said their national security experience had made them 'deeply suspicious that 
the Russian government played a significant role in this case' and cited several elements of the 
story that suggested the Kremlin's hand at work." Politico adds former Trump Administration 
officials "who signed the letter include Russ Travers, who served as National Counterterrorism 
Center acting director; Glenn Gerstell, the former NSA general counsel; Rick Ledgett, the 
former deputy NSA director; Marc Polymeropoulos, a retired CIA senior operations officer; and 
Cynthia Strand, who served as the CIA's deputy assistant director for global issues." In a piece 
for Defense One (10/19, 2K), Patrick Tucker cites a number of former IC officials criticizes 
Ratcliffe's claim. 
Trump Blasts "Corrupt Press" For Failing To Cover Allegations Against The 
Bidens. The Washington Post (10/19, Al, Scherer, Dawsey, 14.2M) reports that on Monday in 
a call with his campaign staff, President Trump maintained that Joe Biden ought to be "in jail," 
and is "a criminal." According to the Post, Trump "also made repeated references to alleged 
communications between Biden's son Hunter and foreign officials that have been reported in 
the New York Post in recent days." Trump is quoted as saying, "I think Joe Biden has a scandal 
coming up that will make him almost an impotent candidate. This scandal is so big. And the 
only thing he has going is he has a corrupt press who will not write about it." Breitbart (10/19, 
Spiering, 673K) reports the President "spoke as he prepared for a campaign rally in Prescott, 
Arizona." 
Fox News (10/19, Singman, 27.59M) says Joe Biden has "remained mum on questions 
about his knowledge of his son Hunter's overseas business dealings, which were discussed in a 
series of emails purportedly found on a laptop belonging to his son." According to Fox News, 
"The former vice president is not expected to host or attend any public events until Thursday -
the date of the final presidential debate, where President Trump is expected to bring up 
allegations stemming from the emails." 
More Commentary. Michelle Goldberg writes for the New York Times (10/19, 18.61M) 
that so far, "the Hunter Biden laptop affair is a farcical retread of the Russian hack-and-leak 
operation that helped torpedo Hillary Clinton's presidential aspirations in 2016." She adds that if 
"there's an important story here, it's almost certainly about Giuliani's dirty tricks, not any 
wrongdoing by Joe Biden." 
In an op-ed for The Hill (10/19, 2.98M), former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy 
argues that the key here in this dispute is whether the laptop is what it is purported to be. 
States, Voting Districts Work With Law Enforcement To Secure Elections. 
Several states and localities are reportedly working with the FBI and US Attorneys to prepare 
for securing elections in the event of fraud or attempts to derail the vote. 
The Bangor (ME) Daily News (10/19, 198K) reports that in Maine, the "FBI will have 
agents in Portland on Election Day ready to investigate voter fraud." According to U.S. Attorney 
Halsey Frank, "Assistant U.S. Attorney John Osborn and Andrew McCormack will be in Portland 
and Bangor will handle complaints and oversee the federal response to them as part of the 
longstanding program."
