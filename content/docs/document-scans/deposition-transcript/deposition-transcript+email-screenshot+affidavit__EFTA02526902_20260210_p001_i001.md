examiner was not available so I will have to come back,=do another flight with brad ,since I will not have flown for a 
week, and t=ke the test on sunday. 
If you don't care where the food is bought why did you yell at me when = went shopping at publix and then you 
made up a rule that nobody is to buy=food there for you again. 
brakes the rule and you reward it, I do='t and you announce my granola is shit before you even open the 
box be=ause it looks different than the publix granola you ate before. But I don&=39;t need to tell you; you have to see 
it..its so obvious, just think abou= your reactions
