ext=emely aggressive federal intrusion into what would typically be considered=a quintessentially local criminal matter 
in south Florida. The=C2 offense investigated — at its core, sexual fav=rs for hire — has long been treated as a matter 
entruste= to laws of the several States, not the federal government. The cond=ct — for which Jeffrey took full 
responsibilit= — was a classic state offense and was treated exactly that w=y by able, honest prosecutors in Palm Beach 
County. Nevertheless, =A0without a request from the state prosecutors, the federal governmen= intervened. For their 
own opportunistic reasons, many are now criti=izing the federal decision-makers at the time, including now-Secretary of 
=abor Alex Acosta (then-United States Attorney in south Florida), for not g=ing far enough. 
=he critics are wrong on the facts and the law. They also ignore a fact goi=g to the heart of 
fundamental fairness: In the decade since pay=ng his debt to society, Jeffrey Epstein has led a life characterized by 
re=ponsible citizenship, numerous acts of generosity and good deeds. 
Here are the true key fact=: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made businessman with no p=ior 
criminal history whatsoever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounted=C2 to solicitation of prostitution. That conduct 
was wro=g and a violation of Florida state law. Although no coercion, violen=e, alcohol, drugs or the like were involved, 
some of the women he paid =A0were under the age of 18. Those facts were carefully assessed=by experienced state sex 
crime prosecutors who aggressively enforce state =riminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to 
the=public order. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's O=fice conducted an extensive fifteen-month 
investigation, led by the chief =f the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by the stat= grand jury on a 
single felony count of solicitation of prostitution. =AO 
During that intense investigation, the state prosecutors exten=ively gathered and analyzed the 
evidence, met face-to-face with many =f the asserted victims, considered their credibility — or lack the=eof — and 
considered the extent of exculpatory evidence, incl=ding sworn testimony from many that they lied about being 
eighte=n years old to be allowed into Mr. Epstein's home. After mon=hs of negotiations, the state prosecutors believed 
they had reached a reas=ned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest —=a resolution entirely 
consistent with that of cases involving other simila=ly-situated defendants. The system worked as it should have. 
</=pan> 
Then, in came the fe=s. The United States Attorney's Office extensively and aggressiv=ly 
investigated whether Mr. Epstein had engaged in a commercial human traf=icking ring, targeted minors, or used the 
internet or traveled inters=ate in the process. But that's not what this was a=d that's not what happened. That is 
precisely why the f=deral authorities' ultimate decision to defer prosecution to =he state was the right one. 
However, the federally-demanded resolution was not wit=out conditions. The federal 
prosecutors insisted on various unorthodo= requirements that Mr. Epstein's experienced defense team had neve= seen 
imposed on any defendant anywhere. Under the federally-forced deal, =effrey was required to request that the state 
prosecutors demand the =mposition of a thirty-month sentence that included both jail tim= and the strictest conditions 
of probation: lifetime sex-offender reg=stration. Those draconian measures were far more than warranted by th= state 
grand jury's indictment and would not have otherwise b=en required under the previously agreed-upon state 
disposition. As part of=this highly unusual deal, the government required Jeffrey to pay=for a highly experienced group 
of attorneys to bring claims agai=st him on behalf of a government list of asserted victims. Jeffrey was req=ired to waive
