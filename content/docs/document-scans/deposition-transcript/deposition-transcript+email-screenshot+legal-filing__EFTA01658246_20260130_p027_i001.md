very pleased, and those of us on the Coronavirus Task Force are very pleased to see him having 
done that." 
White House Coronavirus Task Force Response Coordinator Deborah Birx said in an 
interview with Sinclair Broadcasting GroupVi (7/29, 22K), "I think every public health official 
would love it if every single American wore a mask every single day anytime they were in public 
and frankly what I told young people and others, protect your family. If you had one of these 
indiscretions and been out in a large gathering, you should wear a mask at home." 
HUD Secretary Carson said on WEWS-TVVI Cleveland (7/29, 106K) that if people wear 
masks, perform social distancing, have good hygiene, and assume they are symptomatic 
carriers "we would depress this thing so quickly your head would spin." 
NYTimes Endorses Sanders Bill Mandating That Three Masks Be Sent To Every 
Person In US. In an editorial, the New York Times (7/29, 18.61M) recounts that Sen. Bernie 
Sanders (I-VT) "introduced legislation this week that directs the Trump administration to send 
three 'high-quality, reusable' masks to every person in the United States, and would provide $5 
billion to increase mask production. This is a good idea." While "a national campaign to 
encourage people to wear masks, including the distribution of free masks, is not sufficient to 
confront the pandemic...masks would help," and "right now, Americans need all the help they 
can get." 
Pelosi To Institute Mandatory Mask Policy For House After Gohmert Tests Positive. 
CNBC (7/29, Breuninger, 3.62M) reports on its website that House Speaker Pelosi said 
Wednesday that "she will soon be announcing a mandatory mask policy for the floor of the 
House," a development that "comes just hours" after Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) "announced 
that he had tested positive for the coronavirus." Politico (7/29, Caygle, Ferris, 4.29M) recounts 
"lawmakers are currently encouraged to wear masks in the chamber and required to wear them 
in committee rooms - although some Republicans openly defy that rule and have yet to be 
punished." Pelosi said, "Members and staff will be required to wear masks at all times in the hall 
of the House. Except that members may remove their masks, temporarily, when recognized." 
The Hill (7/29, Marcos, 2.98M) also reports the story under the headline "Pelosi To Require 
Masks On House Floor." 
The Houston Chronicle (7/29, Rosenthal, 730K) points out "Gohmert used a widely-
condemned phrase when referring to the virus in his video statement." Kristen Welker of NBC 
Nightly NewsVi (7/29, story 2, 1:00, Holt, Welker, 5.97M) showed the congressman saying, 
"I'm asymptomatic, but apparently I have the Wuhan virus." 
The AP (7/29, Fram, Jalonick) indicates that Gohmert's positive test forced him "to 
abruptly cancel his plan to travel to his home state with President Donald Trump aboard Air 
Force One." Mary Bruce of ABC World News TonightVI (7/29, story 3, 1:10, Muir, 7.22M) 
reported Gohmert "has frequently been spotted on the Hill without a mask," and "sources tell us 
his staff has even been scolded for wearing them." The Washington Examiner (7/29, Ferrechio, 
448K) reports, however, that "a top staffer in the office of...Gohmert denied an anonymous 
claim that employees in the lawmaker's DC office were berated for wearing masks and forced to 
work in dangerous conditions." Said Chief of Staff Connie Hair, "We have never discouraged 
anyone from wearing a mask." 
Gohmert said on Fox News' HannityY (7/29, 535K), "The left went nuts. They are saying, 
'Oh, I contaminate the gym.' I haven't been to the gym in months. They said I berated staff for 
wearing masks and that is a lie." 
Reuters (7/29, Cowan) also reports Gohmert "steadfastly refused to wear a mask during 
the coronavirus pandemic," and USA Today (7/29, Lalljee, Johnson, 10.31M) recalls "Gohmert 
told CNN in June he would only wear a mask if he contracted the virus." Said Gohmert, "I don't 
have the coronavirus, turns out as of yesterday I've never had it. But if I get it, you'll never see 
me without a mask. ... But I keep being tested and I don't have it. So I'm not afraid of you, but
