disclosures were made in any such pitch book, and whether those disclosures revealed 
the alleged conflict. As such, a ruling on the "bespeaks caution" doctrine is not appropriate 
at this juncture in the case because it involves deciding issues of disputed fact. 
r n31 Plaintiffs have alleged all necessary elements of fraud. They have alleged that 
defendants intentionally misrepresented material facts, through omissions and statements 
assuring the plaintiffs that they were acting in Epstein's personal best interest. They have 
also alleged that the person who made these misrepresentations, Davison, knew of the 
relationship between AIG and Citibank and that Epstein and FTC did not know of this 
relationship. Finally, plaintiffs have also alleged that "but foe' defendants misleading 
statements and omissions, plaintiff would not have proceeded with their loan and 
investment programs and would not have suffered these damages. Plaintiffs have thus 
alleged enough information to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion on their fraud claims. 
C. The Mass Mutual Investment Claims 
Although [**10] it is unclear from the second amended complaint which counts concern 
the Mass Mutual Fund, it is clear that at least some of the causes of actions allege that 
Citibank defrauded Epstein in relation to his loans and investment in the Mass Mutual 
Fund. Separately, defendants argue that the court should dismiss the claims alleging fraud 
relating to the Mass Mutual Fund for failure to plead fraud specifically under Rule 9(b) and 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) r**4411 . The 
plaintiffs basic allegation is that "because of Defendants' false assurances and omissions 
of true statements concerning their relationship with AIG and the AIG Investment, Plaintiffs 
made the investment in the Mass Mutual Fund and suffered significant losses." (Compl. P 
65.) 
Defendants essentially argue that plaintiff's loans and investment in the AIG and Mass 
Mutual funds should be viewed as two separate transactions. This view, however, belies 
the alleged conduct of Citibank. The underlying conduct alleged in the second amended 
complaint is that Citibank fraudulently induced plaintiffs into believing they had a preferred 
relationship with Citibank where Citibank was acting in [.11] Epstein's best interest in all 
of their transactions, including investing in the AIG and the Mass Mutual funds. Essentially, 
plaintiffs argue they were induced into a high stakes relationship with Citibank based on 
fraudulent statements and omissions, and but for these statements, they would not have 
enjoyed the type of relationship with Citibank to be in the position either for Citibank to 
present them an offer to loan them large sums of money to invest in the Mass Mutual fund 
or for plaintiff's to trust Citibank's investment advice. I believe that whether the underlying 
complained about conduct was two separate transactions or whether the conduct should 
be viewed as Citibank's relationship as a whole with Epstein is a matter of fact that goes to 
the issue of damages and is not appropriate for a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Therefore, I rule 
that the fraud claims should not be separated into two different types - AIG and Mass 
Mutual - and thus my previous analysis of the applicability of Rule 9(b) and Rule 12(b)(6) 
apply equally to all claims for damages alleged to occur because of Epstein's investments 
in the AIG and Mass Mutual funds.
