As usual, you ignored everything I wrote and and=are pursuing your own agenda. But this letter 
is nevertheless very h=lpful. I've been asking you repeatedly to clear the air and say =xactly what you want instead of 
evading it in one way or another, and this=does come close to that. It also finally explains clearly what I did=not want to 
believe about your refusing my request for some funds for taxe= a few years ago 
You no doubt recall the circumstances.=C2* Unknown to me, my financial advisers had 
arranged to rapidly deplete=my main source of support, my IRA, by distributing half of the mandatory w=thdrawal to 
family members and to use the rest for paying management fees =nd taxes for the entire estate. That meant that when 
I paid Alex'=s expenses, I had to withdraw over the limit, with exorbitant taxes. Same =ith any other funds for any family 
matters, and with Wellfleet payments we=l after I stopped using the house, again with exorbitant taxes. Of c=urse I also 
needed to live, so that meant more withdrawals with exorbitant=taxes. Under those conditions I requested some tax 
relief from the m=rital trust -- which, of course, was established on the understanding that=it would be available to the 
survivor. 
Your react=on, to my amazement, was to refuse, even under these remarkable circumstan=es, 
by imposing absurd conditions that no o=e with a shred of dignity could accept, no concern of yours. Of course, no=such 
questions ever were on even the remote horizon when I was trustee, be=ore choosing you to replace me, or on any 
other occasion when I arranged f=r funds to go to you, either as an ample inheritance or for regular expens=s. 
Your letter now makes your reasoning very clear. =our proposal is that you should remain in 
total control, evidently a matte= of great importance for you. And following your principles, as exhi=ited with crystal 
clarity under even the extreme circumstances just descri=ed, you can ensure that the funds in their entirety will go to 
you, though=l suppose in your kindness you might relax your strict regimen slightly wh=n the day comes, as it must, 
when I am no longer in a position to retain a=shred of dignity and to refuse an intrusive and humiliating 
interrogation.=/span> 
However, there is a simpler way to realize your objectives= even more fully. You can resign as 
trustee -- of course possible, j=st as I did when I appointed you. We can then agree that you receive=the entire funds 
right now, instead of waiting until I die, so that you ca= use them right now for whatever purposes you like. Plainly 
that'=s more efficient, and even more lucrative for you than your suggestion. 
It's true that this is one possible proposal, as you sug=est.
