The Petite Pellet Should Have Precluded Federal involvement. 
As you know, prior to negotiating the terms of (he Agreement. we requested that the 
government consider the Petite Policy and the problems associated with conducting a dual and 
successive prosecution. We stressed to your Office, on u number of occasions. that we had 
reached a final negotiated resolution with the Stale and were only being forced to postpone the 
execution of that agreement for the sake of the federal investigation. We made submissions and 
met with your Office to present analyses of the fact that federal prosecution in this matter was in 
direct conflict with the requirements of the Petite Policy. It was our contention, and remains our 
contention, that federal prosecutors had never intervened in a matter such as this one. And 
because them was no deficiency in the state criminal process that would otherwise require 
federal intervention, the express terms of the Petite Policy precluded federal prosecution 
regardless of the outcome at the state case. Since the slate investigation was thorough and in no 
way inadequate and the concerns implicated by the matter all involved local issues and areas of 
traditionally local concern. we urged your Office to contemplate whether a federal prosecution 
was appropriate. 
However, on August 3, 2007. Matthew Menehel rejected a proposed state plea which 
included that Mr. Epstein serve two years of supervised custody followed by two years of 
incarceration in a state prison, with the option of eliminating incarceration upon suctx=ful 
completion of the term of supervised custody. among other terms. Mr. Manche! stated that - the 
federal interest will not he vindicated in the absence of a two year term in state prison." Sea 
August 3.2007 letter. Such an articulation of the federal interest, we believe. misunderstands the 
Palle Policy on two grounds. First, the Office's position that the federal interest would not be 
vindicated in the absence of a jail term for Mr. Epstein. runs contrary to Section 9-2.03ID of the 
United States Attorney's Manual, because this section requires the federal prosecutor to focus 
exclusively on the quality or process of the prior prosecution. not the sentencing outcome. 
Second, the state plea agreement offered was not "manifestly inadequate" tinder U.S.A.M. § 9-
2.03ID. indeed, the only real difference hews= the state and federal plea proposals was 
whether Mr. Epstein served his sentence in jail or community quarantine. 
We formerly believed that our Petite Policy concerns were being addressed or, at least. 
preserved. hut we learned that only after reaching a final compromise with your Office as to the 
terms of the Agreement, and at the very last minute. that language regarding the Petite Policy 
was removed from the final version. The two following references to the Petite Policy had been 
included in the draft prosecution Agreements up until September 24. 2007. the day the 
Agreement was executed, at which point they were eliminated by your Office: 
IT APPEARING, alter an Met-mitigation of the offenses and Epstein 's background, that the interest 
orthe United Elates pursuant to the Mite policy will be served by the following procedure ... 
Epstein understands that the United States Attorney has no authority to require the state 
Attorney's Office to abide by any terms of this agreement. lipsicin understands that it is his
