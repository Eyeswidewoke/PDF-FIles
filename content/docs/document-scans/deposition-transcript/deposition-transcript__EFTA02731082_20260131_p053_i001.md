use money, and when she said yes, he sent her the money. 
believed Epstein was being 
generous because during their prior conversations about her financial difficulties, Epstein had 
told 
that she would always be safe and he would always take care of her. 
When asked about the Miami Herald series, 
said she was aware as early as April 
2018 that a reporter for the Miami Herald was working on a story about Epstein. 
was 
aware of the series the day it was published in November 2018, and she recalls that she received 
the email from Groff inviting her to meet with Epstein within a day or two of the series' 
publication. Although 
recalled mentioning the series when she met with Epstein in early 
December, she does not recall the details of what they discussed and did not believe the payment 
and articles were related. 
With respect to Epstein's sexual abuse, 
reiterated that Epstein first engaged in 
sexual contact with her shortly after she was hired when he directed her to take a bath with him 
and indicated that her job depended on engaging in sex acts with him. 
explained that she 
did not feel that she had a choice because she did not want to lose her job, which had finally 
helped her feel financially secure. Epstein paid for 
housing, travel, clothing, and food, 
in addition to paying her a salary, which began at approximately $35,000 per year, then increased 
annually until she was earning a bit over $100,000 per year. When Epstein went to jail, she took 
a pay cut to $75,000, which remained her salary until she left her job when she married her 
husband

period,

did not engage in some sort of sexual contact with her. Usually this contact involved Epstein 
bringing 
to a bedroom and giving her explicit instructions regarding how to touch him 
and how to position herself while he masturbated on the bed. Additionally, Epstein frequently 
snuck into 
room while she was sleeping and woke her up by fondling her. 
insisted that she had no memory of any sexual contact taking place in any massage room with 
Epstein or in the context of any massage at all. During this period,

serious boyfriends, and Epstein knew about those boyfriends but still engaged in sexual contact

did not want to engage in any sexual contact with Epstein but felt obligated 
to do so in order to keep her job. 
The sexual contact slowed sometime before Epstein went to jail and evolved into Epstein 
just asking 
to sleep in his bed but not engaging in sexual contact. As this contact slowed,

who was his 
girlfriend. After Epstein was released from jail, 
no longer slept in his bed, and they no 
longer had any sexual contact.
