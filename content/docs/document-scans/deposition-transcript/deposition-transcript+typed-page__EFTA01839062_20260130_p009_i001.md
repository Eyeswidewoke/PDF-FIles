while he was talking to the women in the pink cardigan in front of the hotel. (See CCTV Tape B) 
The call was from Renata Markozina, the head of housekeeping. At that time, according to key 
records, she was in the presidential suite, and according to police reports, she was with 
Nafissatou Diallo, the maid with whom DSK had the encounter about a half hour earlier. She had 
by now told the head of housekeeping she had been attacked in this suite. At 12:43 PM, the head 
engineer got into a guest elevator (he was still with the woman in the pink cardigan.) He was 
joined on the 28ih floor by Derek May, a security guard (and the hotel's union representative.) 
May, a large, muscular man with an ear piece, and Yearwood, appear to be working closely 
together that afternoon, since they are frequently shown together on the CCTV tapes.. 
At 12:45 pm the head engineer used his electronic key to enter the presidential suite where 
Markozina was with Diallo. About 15 minutes earlier, Diallo had encountered her another maid 
near the 28i° floor linen closet, and asked a hypothetical question about what hotel guest could do 
to a maid. After that, Diallo then said she had been sexually attacked by a guest, which led the 
this maid to call the head of housekeeping. It is not known what was said at this meeting but it 
could not have lasted long. At 12:51:56 PM, Diallo and Markozina, along with the security guard 
May, got out of the elevator on the ground floor, as recorded by the CCTV camera [See CCTV 
Tape C]. May stayed with them as far as the main lobby, and the head housekeeper and Diallo 
continued to the corridor used by employees located at the 45'h Street entrance. The hotel's 
security office is there. It had a set of Dutch doors, with the upper half opened. Behind it sat 
Adrian Branch, the Sofitel's head of security. 
Diallo stood next to a solitary bench just across the corridor from this half-opened door . She 
remained standing or sitting here for the next hour and fifteen minutes. 
The head engineer Yearwood did not immediately accompany Diallo downstairs. He remained 
behind on the 28'h floor and, according to the electronic key records, he re-entered the presidential 
suite at 12:51 PM. Whatever his reason for this second visit, it was brief. By 12:53, the CCTV 
cameras recorded him leaving the elevator on the ground floor. [See CCTV Tape D]. He 
walked briskly through the lobby to the security area, where he briefly spoke to Diallo, then 30 
seconds later, he returned to the reception area, where he rejoined the security guard May in a 
curtained office right of the reception desk. . As there was no CCTV camera in this office, we 
do not know what they did there for the next 5 minutes. Possibly, they were checking the records 
to verify Diallo's story. 
If they had consulted the hotel's computerized guest records, they 
would have seen that the client in the presidential suite was DSK, and that he had checked out at 
12: 28 PM (which Yearwood may have himself witnessed.) If they checked electronic key 
records, they would have ascertained that only two employees had entered the suite prior to his 
check out— the room service waiter Haque at 12:05 , and Diallo three time— twice at 12:06 and 
once at 12:26 PM. They would have also seen that both before and after her visit to the 
Presidential suite she had gone to another room across the hall , room 2820. [See Key record in 
Appendix A and B.] 
By I PM, both men had returned to the security area. They would spend a good part of the 
next hour there, either talking on their cell phones or inside the security booth (which was not 
covered by the CCTV cameras). At 1:03 PM, a call was made to the cell phone to John M. 
Sheehan (Sheehan's cell phone calls are a court document.). Sheehan was the director of safety 
and security at its parent company Accor, which is a part of the French-based Accor Group. He 
also had a similar position and office at the Sofitel (which is the Accor Group's only hotel in New 
York.) He was off that day at his home in Washingtonville, New York. Nevertheless, he had
