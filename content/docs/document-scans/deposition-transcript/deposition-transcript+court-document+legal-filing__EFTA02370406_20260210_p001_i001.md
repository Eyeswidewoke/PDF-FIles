Re: 
Wha= I really am looking for is a single buy out price with my willingness to =tay with the practice for no more than 
three years. I want to be don= and over with the business end and not concern myself with another buy-in=or selling 
again after two or three years. 
I am fully aware that Karyna can easily=open her own practice and do exactly what you say for just about the price=you 
predict. I believe that with the licensing changes in the very n=ar future that this kind of scenario will likely occur. The 
only dif=erence is what good will is worth which you don't seem to think is as =aluable as I. You say it can only be 
measured in hind sight yet all =ractice valuations and purchase consider good will as valuable in the pres=nt not in hind 
sight. 
I also cannot retire and be at all comfortable with a $400K sale.=C24, I may truly be pie in the sky but I would hold out 
and hope for cons=derably more when licensing opens up and what will likely be a good number=of dentists more 
willing to practice here given easier licensing. 
I have to leave the off=ce now but we can continue this later.

Hah! My very humble apologies= I have been communicating all day with another Jeffrey from the syn=gogue 
and wasn't paying attention to Jeff E which might explain my cur=ous responses to you. 
I have not given too much thought to the purchase or buy in. =e were so far apart that I truly have not thought 
about this as seriously =s I had. 
You had mentioned a couple of things that I didn't understand. =ne thing mentioned was that Karyna was only 
interested in a couple of year= and then I can sell it again. Does Karyna look at this only as the =wo years of clinical 
experience that would then allow her to qualify for t=e New York license and then she would cease working here? 
Secondly is she only intereste= in working two days a week for a six month period?
