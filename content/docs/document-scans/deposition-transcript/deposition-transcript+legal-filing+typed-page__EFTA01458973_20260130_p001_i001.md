8 December 2015 
World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
has been disappointing, with Singaporeans by and large choosing to keep 
family size small. We think that the Chinese authorities will also find that once 
set in practice, the culture and social attitude in keeping family size small is 
very difficult to reverse. Opening up to more immigration could reduce the 
headwind to aging, but that comes with its own set of political sensitivities and 
social implications. We reckon that most aging societies in Asia will have to 
accept the phenomenon and deal with recalibrating public finance, social 
safety net, and the service sector to take this into account. 
Not all economies in Asia are facing down the barrel of inexorable aging. India, 
Indonesia, and the Philippines, with 1.5bn people among them, should have 
favorable demographics dynamic for decades to come. This could create the 
potential of redistribution of growth, with the aging economies passing on the 
mantle of high growth to the relatively young ones. With the right investment 
policies, the latter economies could become that hub of regional 
manufacturing and demand. These economies also look set to maintain 
comfortable growth and interest rate differential to keep debt sustainable. All 
three are blessed with large populations and a favorable domestic demand 
dynamic that could generate satisfactory growth. 
Having a young population is no guarantee of high growth though. Not only do 
the governments need to put in place the requisite infrastructure and 
employment opportunities for the emerging workforce, they also need to 
ensure social stability that can often be challenged if population grows too fast. 
Trade stagnation 
Asia's success as a region owes much to its dynamic export sector. Over the 
past five decades, starting with Japan. followed by the Tiger economies, and 
then by China, Asian producers have supplied the bulk of manufactured goods 
consumed globally. A cost-competitive and educated workforce, business-
friendly policies, and efficient Infrastructure have combined to give global 
leadership to Asia. But maintaining global market share and manufacturing 
leadership is one thing, continuing to grow with trade is turning out to be an 
altogether different challenge. Even as US growth has picked up, Europe has 
bottomed, and consumers worldwide have been benefitting from low energy 
prices (akin to a tax cut), Asia's exporters have had a torrid year. 
So far this year, all key Asian emerging market economies have reported 
negative exports growth. Whether they are commodity or electronics exporters, 
large or small economies, those that rely on China versus those that rely on G2 
demand, the underperformance is across-the-board. Given the sharp drop in 
global commodity prices and the slowdown in China's investment cycle, it is 
easy to understand why commodity exporters like Indonesia and Malaysia will 
likely report such poor exports earnings. But the weakness among electronics 
producers seems counterintuitive. Surveys of purchasing managers in the US 
and EU show a much better environment presently for new orders than they 
have been in the past, say in 2013. Still, Asian exports are substantially weaker. 
Indeed, the tight historical relationship between Asian exports and lagged 
values of US and EU PMI has broken down over the past few years. Indeed, 
this breakdown in relationship can be seen not just with aggregate data, but 
with country-by-county analysis. The G2 cycle should have been much more 
supportive of Asian exports than has been the case. 
Our conjecture is that the recent bout of poor trade data reflects structural 
factors that will hold back exports (and export related investment) for years to 
come. The recovery in the US and EU is atypical, characterized by poor wage 
growth, low quality jobs, and greater service sector orientation than the past. 
Also, the aging dynamic in both regions is changing the pattern of 
consumption (and imports) profoundly. Furthermore, contrary to press reports
