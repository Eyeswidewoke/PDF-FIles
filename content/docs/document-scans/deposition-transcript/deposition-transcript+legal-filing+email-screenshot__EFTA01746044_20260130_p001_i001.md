Re: Artefacto's mess 
As I expect the deliveries from Artefacto were a chaotic mess that built to t=e disaster that Friday was. We started the 
deliveries on Wednesday in 2G wi=h a miss marked pair of night tables that were already delivered back in Ja=uary. 
Penn's pair of workers were great at moving Len's old furniture out a= the new pieces were coming in but we had to 
empty everything. 
The delivery company sent 4 men this time so they were able to do two apartm=nts at once which was 3M and I ran 
between floors to inspect everything before it entere= the apartments. 
We seemed to be off to a good start until the two teams began to struggle wi=h putting the beds together with multiple 
pieces and no experience in being=able to do it. They took 3 hours each and they wound up slightly damaging the one in 
2G. There also was slight dam=ge to the frame of the artwork delivered because the corner cardboard prote=tors had 
staples facing the finish! 
We did not opener her living room rug because her damaged floor had not be f=xed and it smells of mold so I didn't 
want to put a new rug on top of that.=Meanwhile I had Tessa and Leo coordinating with me and Penn's guys to get 
ah=ad of the Artefacto guys by moving the chairs from BH up to 11J and this is=through a construction site because they 
started the kitchen renovation aga=nst my recommendation to wait until after these deliveries. We also moved a=l of 
the Crate and Barrel deliveries that were in 111 while Karyna's parent= were staying there into 11B so they could be 
distributed which Tessa start=d to do. 
Thursday we picked up with the 8th floor apartment A was fine with no one th=re and it went pretty smoothly because 
we had moved out most of what need t= be the day before. The beds still proved to slow up the progress considera=ly 
as did the freight elevator because the tenants use it as much as the co=tractors. 
Apartment H was a different story with demolition and dust happening which l=put a stop to but also having to move 
the refrigerator out of the hall so we could get to t=e bedroom! 
Karyna and I spoke about 
getting her mirror dresser which was the p=an. 
Meanwhile the deliveries now started on the 10th floor in unit B which we h=d already emptied prior and I am now 
running between two floors to inspect and direct. We had t= move her existing sofa out and when they brought the new 
sectional in it w=s a miss match set of a right handed sofa and a right handed chaise, the co=tinuation of a patten of 
pieces being mislabeled. 
I had them move the chaise to 10 N which was getting the same sectional but r=versed. 
Unit F was another struggle. The old furniture from the January delivery was=still there even though Sue knew we were 
coming and apparently Jen was taki=g the sofa but that did not happen so I had Penn's guys move it to 7j along=with all 
the other old furniture. She did not want the coffee table or medi= unit that everyone had seen from the beginning and 
were custom orders so t=ey could not be returned. 
As Friday began I thought we had at least turned a corner, I was sadly mista=en. 
The beds continued to slow them up and Penn decided to install Julia's new s=ower door on the same day. She also 
decide not to want the carpet for her l=ving room so we put the bedroom carpet there. Then they opened the crate fo= 
her console and it had a major imperfection that neither of us would accep= so it went back. They opened up another 
dresser and it had the same proble=s that the ones delivered in January had so I sent that back. Then Room & B=ard 
showed up with their curbside delivery and because of intense traffic w= had to accept on the corner of 67th and 2nd! 
This is when I received a cal= from Rich that Jeffrey was not happy with the coffee tables which everyone=had seen and 
approved from the beginning of the order. 
I carried on and had Penn's guys put the boxes up on 11 so I could check the= in only to discover that all 8 boxes had the 
same manifest on them that sa=d they were all for 11j ! 
I had them put in 11B to be sorted out on Monday .
