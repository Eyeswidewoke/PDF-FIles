that you informed us of, and regarding which I await w=itten documentation from Bainco when they provide the 
materials I have requested. 
VC: There are three IRA accounts, acco=ding to the IRA/ESA Distribution Request Forms that Bainco has been sendin= us 
along the years, as I mentioned above in this letter. I would like if you could check on this. DPQ: Of course. As soon as 
we =et the materials from Bainco. 
<=LI> 
As I also explained to Avi, years ago when the estate was planne=, the prime concern of the lawyers was avoiding estate 
taxes. The in=estments were assigned to trusts in Mommy's name, since we assumed that I would die first.4>=A0 The 
intention of course was that the money would be available to the su=vivor, but things did not work out as we had 
anticipated and now, as the trusts are written, it seems that I have no access to them. OPQ:40=A0 This is not entirely 
accurate as Noam is the income beneficiary of thes= trusts and must receive all the net income annually, and he is also 
entit=ed to principal distributions as the trustees "consider advisable". At my death, =he estate goes to you. D=Q: 
Carol's trusts are left to the children at Noam's=death. Except for the small amount of assets currently in Noam4>=99s 
revocable trust (we will be updating this trust after we meet in March), Noam's es=ate is left to Valeria under the terms 
of his new will and pursuant to the=beneficiary designation of the large IRA at Bainco which I am awaiting 
doc=mentation to confirm. The term "estate" references the totality of a decedent's assets so the balance of C=rol's 
estate, i.e. the Marital Trusts, go to the children, but Noa='s estate does not. 
VC: We have not been informed that Noam has been=receiving ANY of the Trusts net income nor principal distributions. 
<=span>DPQ: Yes, this is a concern. When we receive the materials from Bainco we=should be able to determine where 
the required net income distributions ar= being deposited. Principal is paid at the discretion of the trustees.40=A0 They 
made some principal distributions to pay Noam's income taxes and estimates last year.<=> 
That leaves us with the IRA. I did not realize this, but t=ough Bainco was aware that the IRA was my only source of 
funds, and was of=course diminishing, they continued to make distributions to ten family recipients. We were al=o 
paying almost $50,000 a year for Wellfleet, and paying other expenses, l=ke Alex's medical bills. It seems that we were 
also paying taxes=for the entire estate. DPQ: I think Noam is refe=ring to Carol's Marital Trusts here. Am I correct? 
4>=A0 
VC: No, Deborah. The money for all this ha= been coming from distributions from the IRA (and most of it, if not ALL, 
=rom the one Noam has designated me as the beneficiary). DPQ:=C24, Thanks Valeria. 
Just to give you an idea of the scale, there is an automatic $30=,000 deduction a year from the IRA. DPQ: In the interest 
of being accurate the Minimum Required Distribution changes somewhat each =ear depending on market fluctuations 
and Noam's age. This is=not a deduction from the IRA, rather, this is the minimum distribution to =oam as required 
under our tax laws. This is perhaps just a semantic point. 
Distributions and taxes come close to the total deduction 
from t=e IRA, and other expenses of the kind just mentioned (plus Anthony) carry =xpenses well beyond the funds 
coming in. 
VC: Although a requirement under the tax laws, t=e distributions (withdrawals) from the IRA were being used for 
donations t= family members and other expenses that we should not be responsible for, considering that the IRA =s the 
only stable source of money left for Noam. DPQ: Agreed. 
Plainly, we cannot continue any of this while living on a diminishing IFtA.-C2. I did request that a marital trust pay the 
taxes on the IRA, but Har=y insisted on conditions that I could not possibly accept, and I was very =urprised, frankly, that 
any conditions were even considered. Perhaps that had to do with the serious miscon=eptions about our expenses, 
whatever their source.
