coy or inviting, and even though the professional photographer who had been 
tricked into taking photographs did not knowingly or intentionally exhibit chil-
dren in lewd poses; photographs displayed preadolescent girls fully nude from 
frontal view, and were arranged by defendant in order to be used to satisfy his 
sexual interests or those of other pedophiles." The court also found that corre-
spondence with the codefendant was of considerable probative value in proving 
the defendant's intent to create and market child pornography. Id. at 1047-48. 
The court also found that the codefendant actively participated in the scheme by 
processing and modifying these photographs in order to render them suitable for 
commercial distribution, and photographs of nude children were arranged by 
the defendant in order to be used to satisfy the sexual interests of himself and 
other pedophiles. During the commission of all these offenses the defendant 
himself was in custody in the state penitentiary. The court also upheld expert 
testimony about "whether Cross obtained the photos with the intention of using 
them to produce and distribute child pornography." Id. at 1050. 
If the court in the Cross decision had followed the Willard case, which it cited, 
and looked only at the photographs and photographer, they could not have found 
them to be lewd (lascivious). Without knowing the total facts of the case, which 
cannot be ascertained by just looking at the photographs, most courts and 
individuals would consider many of the photographs in the Cross case to be 
"innocent nudes" or art. 
How does the law apply to individuals who "modify" the images originally 
produced by someone else? The facts in United States. v. Arvin, 900 F.2d 1385, 
1391 (9th Cir. 1990), involve a defendant who was not the photographer. The 
court in Arvin mentions the criteria for lasciviousness of "captions on the 
pictures." Id. This determination seems to dearly imply that factors not in the 
picture or modifications made to it after it was taken can be considered in deter-
mining its lascivious nature. The importance of such subsequent modifications to 
existing images is one of the primary focuses of the CPPA of 1996. Does the 
individual who makes such modifications become the producer? What if the 
modifier/producer and the intended viewer are the same person? 
In Knox the court states, "we adhere to the view that 'lasciviousness' is an 
inquiry that the finder of fact must make using the Dost factors and any other 
relevant factors given the particularities of the case, which does -not involve an 
inquiry concerning the intent of the child subject" (32 F.3d at 747). The court in 
Knox also mentions the defendant's handwritten description on the outside of 
the film boxes as evidence that Knox was aware that the videotapes contained 
sexually oriented materials designed to sexually arouse a pedophile. Id. at 754. 
The intent of the "collector" is also referred to in United States v. Lamb, 945 E 
Supp. 441, 450 (N.D.N.Y. 1996), where, in discussing affirmative defenses it states, 
"this court presumes that Special Agent Ken Lanning, who according to the 
affidavits in the search warrants in this case is an expert in the field of child por-
nography and pedophilia, could not be subject to prosecution consonant with the 
First Amendment for violations of this statute, even if he literally transgressed its 
boundaries in the writing of his book, Child Pornography and Sex Rings." In United 
States v. Hilton, 167 F.3d 61, 75 (1° Cir. 1999), the court states that "a jury must 
decide based on the totality of circumstances."
