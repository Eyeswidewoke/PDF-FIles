demonstrate the "irreducible constitutional minimum of standing", which is informed by three 
elements: (I) that they each personally suffered some actual or threatened "injury in fact" (2) 
that is "fairly traceable" to the challenged action of the defcndants; (3) that likely "would be 
redressed" by a favorable decision in Court. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 
560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).11 The Court has examined in depth the 
charge sheets and court records of each of the three plaintiffs, which were submitted for this 
Court's in camera review: the Court is satisfied that the plaintiffs have alleged a personal stake in 
the outcome of this litigation that is traceable to defendants and II The actual injury requirement 
ensures that issues will be resolved "not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a 
concrete factual context." Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of 
Church and State, inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982). 18 
redressable by a favorable decision in Court. There is no dispute,12 and more importantly the 
record evidence establishes, that each plaintiff was convicted of one violation of La.R.S. 
14:89(A)(2), which was the prior version of the Crime Against Nature by Solicitation before it 
was reenacted as La.R.S. 14:89.2.13 The record confirms that each plaintiff is required to 
register as a result of a Crime Against Nature by Solicitation conviction; the prohibited conduct 
is also prohibited by the Prostitution statute, but without any registration requirement; the record 
also establishes that at no time were the plaintiffs required to register as a sex offender as a result 
of a conviction pursuant to those provisions where the age of the person solicited 12 By 
focusing on whether or not the plaintiffs have proven whether they solicited sex from a minor, 
the defendants appear to concede that plaintiffs were each convicted of Crime Against Nature by 
Solicitation. Whether Act 402 places this burden on the offender, as opposed to the local district 
attorney, is not an issue that is decided at this time, although it could be important in the context 
of a merits inquiry into the Equal Protection challenge. 13 La.R.S. 14:89(A)(2) provided: A. 
Crime against nature is: (I) The unnatural carnal copulation by a human being with another of 
the same sex or opposition sex or with an animal.... (2) The solicitation by a human being of 
another with the intent to engage in any unnatural carnal copulation for compensation.... 19 
would be relevant: (C).15 By showing La.R.S. 14:89.114 or La.R.S. 14:89.2(BX3) or that they 
continue to be subject to the requirements of the registry law -- which imposes such burdens as 
paying annual registration fees; requires extensive community notification obligations; inclusion 
of the words "SEX OFFENDER" prominently on their driver's licenses; and adherence to 
separate evacuation protocols in the event of a state emergency -- the plaintiffs injury. have 
shown an actual, concrete and particularized They have satisfied the first element of Article III 
standing. Second, the plaintiffs must establish that their injuries are fairly traceable, or caused by, 
the defendants' actions. As this Court previously observed, and the defendants did not dispute, 
there seems little doubt that the defendants are responsible for administering and enforcing the 
sex registry law. This places the defendants among those who contribute to the plaintiffs' 
claimed harm. Because the defendants have the authority to enforce the 14 La.R.S. 14:89.1 
singles out aggravated crimes against nature, including "when the victim is under the age of 
seventeen years and the offender is at least three years older than the victim." 15 La.R.S. 
14:89.2(B)(3) is a subsection of the Crime Against Nature by Solicitation statute; (B)(3) 
provides for harsher penalties when the victim solicited is under the age of 18 ((BX3Xa)), and 
even harsher penalties when the victim solicited is under the age of 14 ((B)(3Xb)). Subsection C 
requires sex offender registration for those convicted of Crime Against Nature by Solicitation of 
a minor (those convicted under (B)(3)). 20 registry law, they have significantly contributed to 
the plaintiffs' claim of harm and, thus, the plaintiffs' injuries are traceable to the defendants'
