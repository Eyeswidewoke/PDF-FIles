Risk Factors 1 (continued) 
LONFIDENTIAL FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 
Step-Up Interest Rate on the Senor Notes 
The Interest Rate on the Senor Notes will increase on the earlier of (i) the date that is twelve months following the Issuance Date and (ii) the date a Non-Refinancing Event occurs (the "Initial Step-Up 
Date"). Following the Initial Step-Up Date, and again if later a Non-Refinancing Event occurs. higher amounts of interest payments will be made on the Senior Nails and amounts that would otherwise 
be available to make distributions on the Preferred Shares will be reduced, which would adversely affect returns on the Preferred Shares. 
Uncertainties Concerning LIBOR 
The Interest Rate on the Senor Notes is based upon LIBOR and therefore may fluctuate from one Interest Accrual Period to another due to changes in LIBOR. Changes in LIBOR will affect the 
amount of interest payable on the Senior Notes. and will have corresponding effects on amounts available for distributions on the Preferred Shares. 
Interest Rate Risks 
There may be a timing or basis mismatch between the Senior Notes and the assets of the Issuer that are floating rate obligations. As a result of such mismatches. changes in the level of LIBOR or any 
other applicable floating rate index could adversely affect the ability of the Co-Issuers to make payments on the Senior Notes and the Preferred Shares. 
Hedge Counterparty Risks 
The Issuer is authorized to enter into hedge agreements at any time or from time to time in order to manage interest rate mismatches, timing mismatches and other risks. In the event of an insolvency 
or other default by a hedge cotnterparty. the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of each related hedge counterparty. 
Risks of Hedge Agreements 
The Issuer's obligations to make payments pursuant to any hedge agreement will rank senior to the Issuer's obligations to make payments on the Preferred Shares. 
Issuer Expenses 
Through their investment in the Preferred Shares. investors bear the cost of the Issuer's advisory fees and other ongoing expenses of the Issuer, which. in the aggregate, may be greater than if an 
investor were to directly make investments in the Issuer's assets. 
Risks of Amendments 
The consent of holders of Preferred Shares is generally not required or is only required from less than 100% of the Preferred Shares that would be materially and adversely affected by any amendment 
to the Issuer's transaction documents. 
U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment as Equity 
The Issuer intends to treat the Senior Notes as debt, and the Preferred Shares as equity, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, no ruling has been sought as to the proper classification of the 
Senior Notes and the Preferred Shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
WAS of Withholding Tax or Changes in Tax Law 
There can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, payments on the Issuers assets that were not subject to withholding 
tax when pirchased might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or that the amount or rate of withholding tax to which a payment on an asset is subject might not increase. 
Risk of U.S. Entity-Level Taxation 
The Issuer will have in effect an election to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and U.S. Holders of Preferred Shares in the Issuer will be treated as holding equity for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes. The Issuer may be engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal Income tax purposes. 
U.S. Withholding Tax and Compliance Risks under FATCA 
The Issuer may be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax pursuant to FATCA on certain U.S.-source payments received by the Issuer beginning July 1, 2014 and the proceeds of certain sales received 
by the Issuer beginning January 1, 2017 with respect to an obligation that is issued or materially modified on or after July 1. 2014 unless it has in effect an agreement with the IRS or otherwise complies 
with the provisions of an intergovernmental agreement, if any, between the United States and the Cayman Islands. 
Risks to Issuer of Non-Permitted Holder of Preferred Shares 
If the Issuer were to be engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal Income tax purposes, it would be required to pay over to the Internal Revenue Service amounts 
approximating the U.S. federal income tax owed by any non-U.S. holder of a Preferred Shares as a result of income earned from such activities. 
(1) A more detailed description of risk factors will be contained in a definitive Private Placement Memorandum of the Issuer with respect to the Preferred Shares.
