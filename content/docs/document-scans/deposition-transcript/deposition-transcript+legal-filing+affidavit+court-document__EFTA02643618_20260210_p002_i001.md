will be the trustee. As before, there will be no problem= about fiduciary responsibility, no concern about liability, no 
problem ab=ut funds that are needed, no lawyers or intrusive inquiries into finances.=/div> 
Furth=rmore, you can be assured that after I die most of the trust will be added=to your inheritance. Now that 
the radical depletion of my IRA has be=n overcome, and I have responsible financial advisers, there will be limit=d 
occasion to access the Trust, and my advisers will ensure that there are=no distributions from it without my knowledge 
and that other requirements =ill be honored with regard to interest and other matters. 
2. We can adopt your suggestion, leaving you in charge, i= which case you will ensure that the entire Trust will 
go to you. To=repeat the very simple logic, a few years ago, before I found out about it= my IRA was being very seriously 
depleted. Half of the mandatory wit=drawal was being distributed to family, the other half was being used to p=y 
management fees and taxes for the entire estate. Therefore, in ord=r to pay Alex's medical bills and expenses for 
Wellfleet, I had to mak= extra withdrawals with an onerous tax payment. And since I also nee=ed something to live on, I 
had to make still more withdrawals, with even f=rther onerous tax payments. At that point I asked Max to release som= 
funds from the marital trust for tax relief. You refused, demanding=an intrusive and insulting financial accounting that 
no one with a shred o= dignity would accept -- particularly under these remarkable circumstances= It follows that any 
request without such very clear justification w=ll also be refused. So you can be assured of receiving the entire Tr=st. I 
also suggested an improvement: you can take all of it right no= and we can dissolve the Trust. 
<=pan style="font-size:12.8px">3. We can pursue my suggestion: divid= the Trust right now and dissolve it. To 
repeat, there are some arca=e tax issues, but can easily be resolved, as your lawyer can explai= to you, with common 
consent among the beneficiaries -- which means your c=nsent. 
These appear to be the options. I hope we can settle this quickly.=C24> As I have repeatedly explained with no 
response, I cannot expect wha= my father was able to enjoy, but at least I would like to end this partic=lar horror as 
quickly as possible. Could you please, then, send me y=ur specific suggestions. 
Earlier letter below.

</=iv> 
As usua=, you ignored everything I wrote and and are pursuing your own agenda.4>=A0 But this letter is 
nevertheless very helpful. I've been askin= you repeatedly to clear the air and say exactly what you want instead of 
=vading it in one way or another, and this does come close to that. 1= also finally explains clearly what I did not want to 
believe about your r=fusing my request for some funds for taxes a few years ago 
You no doubt re=all the circumstances. Unknown to me, my financial advisers had arra=ged to rapidly deplete 
my main source of support, my IRA, by distributing =alf of the mandatory withdrawal to family members and to use the 
rest for =aying management fees and taxes for the entire estate. That meant th=t when I paid Alex's expenses, I had to 
withdraw over the limit, with =xorbitant taxes. Same with any other funds for any family matters, and wit= Wellfleet 
payments well after I stopped using the house, again with exorb=tant taxes. Of course I also needed to live, so that 
meant more with=rawals with exorbitant taxes. Under those conditions I requested som= tax relief from the marital 
trust -- which, of course, was established on=the understanding that it would be available to the survivor.
