the incorporation fee. In the case of an exempt company, this fee is $400. The incorporation papers 
must be accompanied by a consent signed by the appointed resident agent of the company. 
To be eligible for exempt company benefits, a company must also elect that status. This is most 
easily accomplished by including in the articles of incorporation a statement to the effect that the 
company shall be considered an exempt company under the Exempt Company Law. 
After organization, the directors and officers should be elected and the minimum capital of $1,000 
should be paid in exchange for the company's stock. While the identity of the stockholders is not 
required to be disclosed in the annual report or otherwise on the public record, the stockholder's 
identity my have to be revealed to the tax authorities in the Virgin Islands or the United States 
should the company ever be required to prove that at least 90% of the shares of the company are 
owned by persons who are not United States or Virgin Islands persons. Likewise, the 
implementation agreement between the Virgin Islands and the United States provides that any 
Virgin Islands corporation owned or controlled by a person whose beneficial ownership is 
undisclosed (such as through bearer shares) is to be treated as owned, to that extent, by United 
States persons. While no regulations interpreting this provision have been promulgated to date, 
regulations arc anticipated which will provide that a presumption of ownership by a United States 
person may be rebutted if a local resident agent maintains records proving that the exempt 
company is beneficially owned by persons who are not United States persons and such records are 
made available to the tax authorities on proper demand. Failure to maintain such records, or to 
make them available, could result in the loss of tax exempt status. Of course, another way to avoid 
this problem is to ensure that an exempt company is not used in a corporate structure where any of 
the companies in the tiers above the exempt company are bearer share companies. 
HI. Practical Applications 
General Considerations. 
In considering where and how to properly use a Virgin Islands exempt company it is essential to 
consider the benefits and limitations of this type of entity. The one benefit offered by an exempt 
company that can be obtained in no other jurisdiction is certainly the most important: the U.S. 
Virgin Islands exempt company is the only type of tax free entity which may be established under 
the United States flag. The need for an entity with United States nationality, therefore, will usually 
be a key factor in choosing a Virgin Islands exempt company and, as will be explained below, this 
status can prove beneficial in numerous ways. 
For some potential owners of Virgin Islands exempt companies, the most important trade off for 
United States status will be the inability to completely shield the identity of the beneficial owner. 
As explained above, while the owner's identity may be shielded from the public eye, it may be 
required to be revealed to the United States or Virgin Islands tax authorities in order to maintain 
the company's tax exempt status. Therefore, if complete secrecy is an important factor, then a 
different jurisdiction should be considered. 
The government fees for the establishment and maintenance of a Virgin Islands exempt company 
make it generally competitive with other offshore jurisdictions. For example, while it costs
