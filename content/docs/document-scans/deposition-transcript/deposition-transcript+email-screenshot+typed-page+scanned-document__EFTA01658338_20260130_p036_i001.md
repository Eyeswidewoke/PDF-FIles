Breitbart Analysis: Google "Interfering" In 2020 Election By Suppressing 
Breitbart Search Visibility. Breitbart (7/28, Bokhari, 673K) reports, "A few days after the 
2016 election, at an internal meeting later leaked to Breitbart News, top Google executives, 
including Sundar Pichai, Sergey Brin, and Kent Walker, lamented President Trump's victory," 
likening his "voters to 'extremists' and discussing their desire to make Trump's election and the 
populist movement a 'blip' in history. True to their word, four years later, Google is deliberately 
working to interfere with the reelection of Trump in 2020. There are several ways in which 
Google is interfering in the 2020 election, but this article will focus primarily on one of them: 
political search bias. Search visibility is a key industry measure of how findable a publisher's 
content is in Google search. New data shows that Google has suppressed Breitbart's search 
visibility by 99.7 percent since 2016."

The Washington Post (7/28, Rein, 14.2M) reports that a veteran, "suffering in pain and out of 
medication, turned last year to the Veterans Affairs' flagship hospital in D.C. for help. Instead of 
receiving aid," a new report by the VA inspector general released Tuesday said, "a cascade of 
failures by the medical staff resulted in him being forcibly expelled." He shot and killed himself

multiple mental health and emergency room staff, but it exposed an insensitive call by the 
emergency department's attending physician."

The Washington Post (7/28, Hudson, 14.2M) reports that in a "scathing report" about Secretary 
of State Pompeo Tuesday. Senate Democrats criticized his "management of the State 
Department, decrying the broad vacancies at the agency and high-profile resignations of career 
officials because of alleged intimidation and retribution campaigns by political appointees." The 
Post says the report "probably will provide ammunition for liberal lawmakers who are poised to 
grill Pompeo about his actions during his public appearance before the committee on Thursday." 
The New York Times (7/28, Verma, 18.61M) says the report "says Mr. Pompeo's 
department is rife with what it describes as troubling issues: vacant key department posts, a 
culture of disrespect toward career staff members and an atmosphere of political retaliation. 
Democrats say this has hampered the agency's effectiveness in pursuing diplomatic 
relationships abroad or responding to crises like the coronavirus pandemic."

guidance saying that under the Supreme Court's decision in Espinoza v. Montana Department of 
Revenue, the "Office of Justice Programs cannot exclude religious or evangelizing groups from 
eligibility for grant funding." In the case, the Court held that taxpayer-financed vouchers for 
education can be used for a Christian school. 
Census Officials Worry White House Is Pushing To Complete Count Early. 
The New York Times (7/28, Wines, 18.61M) reports census officials are concerned that the 
Administration and Senate Republicans "appear to be signaling that they want the census 
finished well ahead of schedule, pandemic or not." The Times says the Administration "took the 
Census Bureau by surprise last week," when "it asked the Senate Appropriations Committee to 
set aside $448 million in the next coronavirus relief package for a 'timely' completion of the 
census." The request, which "did not define what 'timely' meant," comes "as census workers 
and former officials say the White House and the Commerce Department, which oversees the 
Census Bureau, are asking how the bureau can compress its schedule to wrap up the count of 
households earlier than expected - perhaps by the end of September. The aim, they say, may
