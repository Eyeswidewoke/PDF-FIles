Despite this awarene=s, that insolvency was destined to hit home during a number of key moments=from the Boer War 
to post-war colonial crises to Suez. Britain suffered th=s fate in part because successive governments in London, 
although scaling back military and diplomatic commitments in a =ashion that many commentators have found to be a 
masterful example of step=ing back from global primacy,3 still could not bring themselves to make a =lean break with a 
deeply-ingrained strategic posture and fashion a more sustainable global role. Great Britai= remained continually 
overextended, and suffered the drawn-out consequence=. 
Throughout history, =ajor powers have confronted painful inflection points when their resources= their national will, or 
the global geopolitical context no longer sustain=d their strategic postures. The very definition of grand strategy is 
holding ends and means in balance to promo=e the security and interests of the state.4 Yet, the post-war U.S. approac= 
to strategy is rapidly becoming insolvent and unsustainable not only beca=se Washington can no longer afford it but 
also, crucially, because it presumes an American relationship with =riends, allies, and rivals that is the hallmark of a 
bygone era. If Washin=ton continues to cling to its existing role on the premise that the intern=tional order depends 
upon it, the result will be increasing resistance, economic ruin, and strategic failure= 
The alleged insolven=y of American strategy has been exhaustively chronicled and debated since =he 1990s. The 
argument here is that twenty years of warnings will finally =ome true over the next five to ten years, unless we adjust 
much more fundamentally than administrations of ei=her party have been willing to do so far. The forces undercutting 
the U.S.=strategic posture are reaching critical mass. This is not an argument abou= "decline" as such; the point here is 
merely that specific, structural trends in U.S. domestic governanc= and international politics are rendering a particular 
approach to grand s=rategy insolvent. Only by acknowledging the costs of pursuing yesterday's =trategy, under today's 
constraints, will it be possible to avoid a sort of halfway adjustment billed as true r=form, forfeiting the opportunity for 
genuine strategic reassessment. That =pportunity still exists today, but it is fading. 
Enduring Assumpti=ns 
The consensus of con=entional wisdom today holds several specific tenets of U.S. national secur=ty strategy dear. It is 
important to grasp the paradigm because existing t=ends are making a very specific U.S. national security posture 
infeasible. The primary elements include:=/p>

America's global role was central to=constructing the post-war order and remains essential to its stability

American military power, including t=e ability to project power into any major regional contingency, is 
predomi=ant and should remain so for as long as possible, both to reassure allies =nd to dissuade rivals;

The stability of many regions has be=ome dependent on a substantial U.S. regional presence of bases,

The United States must commit to the=force structures, technologies, nonmilitary capacities, and geopolitical

continued U.S. predominance and global power projection. In=fact, it has been central to all post-Cold War U.S. foreign 
policy doctrines. It was Bill Clinton's Secretary of Stat= who called America "the indispensable nation,"5 Clinton who 
decided to =xpand NATO to Russia's doorstep and Clinton who inaugurated the post-Cold =ar frenzy of humanitarian 
intervention.6 The George W. Bush administration embraced a strategy of primacy and dissu=ding global competition. 
As Barry Posen has remarked, the debate in post-C=ld War U.S. grand strategy has been over what form of hegemony to 
seek, no= whether to seek it.7 A variety of powerful trends now suggest that the existing paradigm is becoming
