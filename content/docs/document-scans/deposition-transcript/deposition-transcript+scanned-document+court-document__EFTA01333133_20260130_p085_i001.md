On May 10, 2006, information was received that Epstein's associate, 
Leslie Wexner, The Limited Inc, CEO's, plane had arrived in West Palm 
Beach, PBIA. The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N900LS registration, 
was on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently 
acquired the services of a new attorney, and the fact that Epstein's 
house is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may 
be in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence, 
358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting 
remodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed 
driving a Ford Ex lorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida 
registration of 
Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north 
on County Road. Det 
and I conducted surveillance on Norr. 
Norr traveled to sevel!!..struction sites and checked on certain 
jobs. Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det 
and I 
traveled to Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue 
stripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was 
visible on the bottom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane. 
We maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a 
caravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed 
several people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of 
the executive team for Limited Inc. The executives were in Palm Beach 
County for an executive meeting for the day. They arrived in Palm 
Beach County on May 9, 2006 at 9:30 pm and were scheduled to leave on 
the 10th at 5:00 pm. 
On May 12, 2006, I met with ASA 
at the State 
Attorney's Office. She explained that her boss, Barry Krischer, was 
requesting this case be taken to the Grand Jury again. I 
o 
her 
uested arrest warrants for Jeffrey Epstein, 
and 
I asked that she either issue the warrants or 
direct i e, as so much time has elapsed since the original request to 
the Grand Jury. I explained that the Palm Beach Police Department had 
concluded the case in December of 2005 and has been waiting for the 
case to go forward. 
stated the original offer was again 
offered to the new defense attorney. She was waiting for their answer 
by Friday May 19, 2006. She stated she would advise me of the answer.
