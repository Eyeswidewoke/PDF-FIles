Equity Value = Enterprise Value + net =ash (or — net debt). 
One matter of judgment =s what of the cash balance is "excess cash". Joel =as 
said he believes all the cash is due to the models. The facts =how that in the ordinary course of business the collection 
of =eceivables offsets the payables and in the past three years, the cash =alance has only fluctuated at most by $3 
million, meaning anywhere from =8-10 million on the balance sheet should be considered to be "exc=ss cash", not 
needed for day-to-day operations. I have =ttached both a three year cash balance tracker and a current balance =heet 
for your review. 
Using the above, a very =odest calculation of value would be $6.7 million of 
EBITDA x 5 multiple =a 50% discount to the market) or an enterprise value of $33.5 million =nd if we took a conservative 
view of what excess cash is at the moment =f $8 million, would result in a total equity value of $41.5 =illion. Our 42% 
would equate to $17.4 million of proceeds to =s. That is at a multiple that has been deeply discounted to the =arket 
comps that were actually paid for companies in the same =usiness. 
We are, however, willing to take much less =han this very discounted value 
calculation, as I have mentioned to you =efore. However, your proposal of $5 million of proceeds to us =epresents an 
equity value of $11.9 million ($51.42), an enterprise =alue of $3.9 million ($11.9 million - $8 million of excess cash) or an 
=BITDA multiple of 0.58x ($6.7 x 0.58 = $3.9 enterprise value), a =evel that is far too low for us to accept. 
I look forward to our =iscussion tomorrow morning.

Pretty funny =eale... 
Even the silly open gate proposal was in =ssence stepping into your shoes for 
only 6 million cash. BACK THEN =! 
Then proposing to distribute =hat they estimated to be almost the full total (14 
of the 15 million) =f cash on the balance sheet. Chris i must point out that is more =han it totals today. Then having 
Joel, Faith, etc leverage =hemselves up by borrowing at 7 percent against the entire co in =rder to make a further 
distribution of an additional 15 million which =nbsp;on paper creates a highly inflated enterprise value. He only 
=roposed 6 million cash infusion which is around the same amount that =ou are currently being offered. They valued 
faith and joels =ngoing equity (that they proposed they "keep in") silly, =t 8mm which is roughly the same as we 
suggested. Financial =ngineering done well is like lipstick.. however not done well is also =ike lipstick. :) This is a 
personal service =usiness, no more no less and suggesting that they leverage themselves =p so you that they can pay 
themselves a higher salary fails the HBS =irst year class that i am aware you have taken. Regarding =nbsp;the 18 million, 
we have distributions from Next directly to =he former shareholders of the claxon offshore entity of approx 3. 
=nbsp;Regarding the receivables you can ask millie... =orry 
PS 
Faith =nd joel will have to borrow the money to buy you out at 5.. can be 
=one, but not so easy. they have never taken out real money =rom the company in any form: salary etc.... hence they 
have =ittle net worth and current lenders are not that comfortable with the =otential liabilities....
