Update on the attached structure chart for our purchase of Phaidon by the 
Trusts: the decision was to use a UK LLP instead of the Scottish one largely 
because the setup process(ie. You need Scottish counsel and a Scottish registered 
address) is easier and the PWC man could not convince all others that there was 
enough benefit. I've been advised there is a definite advantage to having the 
trusts own this through LLCs instead of going directly in (as you read in the 
email I forwarded from Gregor) and Leon will enter through a separate LLC than 
the trusts and be the Managing Member. I'm just thinking through governance and 
who should be on what Boards. The Trustees then would be the members of the LLP. 
Bidco will be buying and own the shares of PPL. Since money for that is coming 
from the trusts I am thinking at least one of the Trustees should be on this 
Board with Leon and Debra-correct? Leon wants the kids themselves to be part of 
this too as a learning experience and as prep for one of them potentially running 
this someday-I am thinking they should only be on the Board of PPL, the actual 
company, Phaidon Press Ltd with the Exec Directors from company management and a 
few additional outsiders Leon has in mind with Publishing expertise-or 
could/should they be on the bidco board? I was advised board meetings of these UK 
cos need to take place in the UK or you can jeopardize status as a UK company. 
Leon & Debra are there frequently, the kids less so. Errors in my thought 
process so far? 
I've also been thinking through your idea of Leon lending money to the trusts in 
the name of an opportunity to forgive over time and thereby make gifts to the 
trust. One of the trusts owes Leon $20mil. I was going to use $21 mil I now have 
on hand in that trust for the purchase. I can first pay Leon back on the 
outstanding loan and then make a new loan if that makes sense. Debra has $4mi1 
left on her gift exemptio , Leon I believe has less than $2mi1. Can I make he 
loan and then forgive in December to use up the gift exemption, or is that too 
soon. If not, how should I size the loan. $20mi1 just seems large unless you do 
the forgiving over a very long period of time. 
Thanks, sorry for imposing on your Sunday, just need to go in tomorrow armed. 
Best, Eileen
