reference here should be to Carol's Marital Trusts, ju=t to be clear that the that is the children's inheritance.<=pan 
style="color:black"> 
VC: I disagree, Debora=. The reference here should be to what corresponds to reality -- =A0Noam's children will 
be taken care from his estate. Not only fr=m Carol's Marital Trust that were composed by Noam as the grantor= 
established to make use of the guarantees for the children and tax issues= but still part of Noam's estate, as we all know. 
Frankly, I always assumed that I would be able to disregard financial =oncerns in my last years, but as a result of 
careless and faulty decisions=taken long ago, and some bad recent advice, that is not the way things are turning out.

Dear Doddoy and Valeria, 
It was really nice to talk to both of you just now - we'll have to =o it more often. 
As I mentioned, I'm sending you a letter from all three of us (Avi =nd Harry in copy). 
We decided to write this letter because we are very worried about what =e've been hearing from you about 
your financial situation and the =mount of stress it is causing you. We have been worried for many months now, but the 
situation seems to be be=oming more and more dire and we feel like we can't just stand by a=d watch it happen any 
more. We want to help find solutions that might be I=ss drastic than what we understand you are considering. 
We have heard you express that you don't have enough money, and thi= is leading you to make big decisions 
that we're afraid could have har=ful consequences for you. Moving is exhausting, and moving twice in three years even 
more so. We would hate to=see you to leave your condo unless you somehow aren't happy there. Mov=ng out of the 
Boston area would be more disruptive still -- again, we'= happily support that if it's what you both want for yourselves, 
but you shouldn't have to do it because of m=sconceptions about money. Teaching classes could be both rewarding and 
dra=ning for you; doing it just to chase down a little bit of extra salary mon=y does not make sense in your 
circumstances. And we definitely don't want to see you drop services that are importa=t to your research and your 
legacy, like your journal subscriptions or Ant=ony's invaluable work on your publications. 
Most of all, we are concerned that you are experiencing such high level= of stress that are simply misplaced. 
We don't understand why you need to worry about money. We know that=you have several million dollars in 
your IRA and that you receive hundreds=of thousands of dollars each year in IRA distributions, as well as significant 
income from royalties and oth=r sources. Of course, many of your expenses have risen, because of some wo=derful 
changes you've made in your life: adding Valeria to the family,=moving to Cambridge, and enjoying some sightseeing as 
part of your travels. We've been thrilled to see your l=fe develop like this. We were relieved that money did not pose an 
obstacle=to you living this phase of your life in the best way possible for you, as=well as providing some long-term 
support for Valeria.
