Bill O'Reilly, Fox News' top•rated political =undit and talk show host, has devoted a great deal of attention to ISIS's 
atrocities a=d what he believes the West's response should be. Unfortunately, while O=#39;Reilly rightly condemns ISIS 
as evil, he frames the conflict as a "holy war" that ISIS is waging against the West, Christians, and anyone =Ise who does 
not share ISIS's extreme views. O'Reilly defined his="talking points" as "Judeo/Christian philosophy versus the Jihad." 
According to O'Reilly, =quot;this is now a so-called holy war between radical jihadists and everybody else including 
peaceful Muslims. ... The holy war is here. And unfortunately it seems the president of United States will be the last one 
=o acknowledge it." While it's a common Fox practice to turn ever=thing into a partisan issue against President Obama, 
O'Reilly is also spreadi=g a very dangerous theology. 
O'Reilly has=also said that it is "appropriate to define the worldwide conflict between Muslim fanatics and nearly 
everybody else. <=>" They "want to kill us," he says. "And there are millions of them -- period."= So O'Reilly has urged 
congregations to act, saying, "Americans of faith and goodwill must demand our federal government begin to take the 
holy war seriously," because, he says, America is the only country that has=the power to lead this fight. 
Here is the prob=em. The idea of a "holy war" is indeed what ISIS most wan=s. It's what ISIS is clamoring for and is 
deliberately trying to provoke with their sadistic and brutal cruelty.40=A0 Their highly publicized barbarity is an attempt 
to provoke a "holy war" with us as their primary enemy, which would give credence to their comp=ete perversion of the 
religion they claim -- a fundamentalist and apocalyptic interpretation of Islam. ISIS would like to be seen as the sole 
defender of true Islam in an existential battle agai=st people of other faiths and other Muslims who do not share their 
extreme beliefs. Dignifying them by accepting their language of holy war only helps legitimize ISIS and makes it easier for 
them to recruit more followers. 
Former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski =ade some excellent points in a recent discussion on MSNBC's 
Morning Joe:<=p> 
The worst thing we can=do is to become the sole combatant against the forces of evil that are operating in =hat region. 
We have to avoid any direct collision with the world of Islam, we mustn't label the enemy as Islamist, but we must work 
with those govern=ents in the region that are prepared to defend themselves.... The key point I have=in mind is that 
strategically we are not the chief protagonist in the region, because if we are, we become the inheritor of the colonial 
era, and we even become more hated in the region than is the case today. 
He also said tha= we should help those in the region who are prepared to deal with the problem, "and also in extreme 
circumstances to take care of those who kill our people, bu= beyond that I think we ought to abstain." Only when we
