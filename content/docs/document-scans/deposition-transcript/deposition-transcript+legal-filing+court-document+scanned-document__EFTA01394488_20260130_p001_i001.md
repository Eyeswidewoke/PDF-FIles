The General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transmit to each Partner, as soon as 
reasonably practicable after the close of each fiscal year (subject to the time the Partnership receives the 
relevant information from the Underlying Fund), the audited financial statements of the Partnership for 
such fiscal year. Commencing with the fiscal year in which the Initial Drawdown Date occurs and for 
each fiscal year thereafter, such financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States or another comprehensive basis of accounting, in each 
cast consistently applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement except that Partnership assets 
shall be valued in accordance with 14.3. 
14.2.2 Annual Tax Information. 
The General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transmit to each Partner, as soon as 
reasonably practicable after the close of each Partnership fiscal year (subject to the time the Partnership 
receives the relevant information from the Underlying Fund), such Partner's Schedule K-1 (Internal 
Revenue Service Form 1065) or an equivalent report indicating such Partner's sham of all items of 
income or gain, expense, loss or other deduction and tax credit of the Partnership for such year, as well as 
the status of such Partner's Capital Account as of the end of such year, and such additional information as 
such Partner reasonably may request to enable it to complete its tax returns or to fulfill any other reporting 
requirements, provided that the General Partner can obtain such additional information without 
unreasonable effort or expense: provided that it is understood that the Partnership does not expect to be 
able to deliver Schedules K-I to the Partners prior to April 15 of each year, and accordingly, the Partners 
will be required to obtain extensions for filing their federal, state and local income tax returns. 
14.2.3 Quarterly Reports. 
The General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each Limited Partner, as soon 
as reasonably practicable following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year of 
the Partnership (subject to the time the Partnership receives the relevant information from the Underlying 
Fund), quarterly reports of the Partnership for the quarter then ended; provided, however, that this 14.2.3 
shall not apply to any fiscal quarter prior to the fiscal quarter in which the Partnership invests in the 
Underlying Fund. 
14.2.4 Information Rights. 
Limited Partners will not receive all of the information or reports that are provided to direct limited 
partners of the Underlying Fund, even though the General Partner may have access to such information.
