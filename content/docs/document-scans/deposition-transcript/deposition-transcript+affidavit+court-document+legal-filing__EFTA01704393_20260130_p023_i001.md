receive a billing statement. This Notice formally amends your Agreement, and any contrary or conflicting language In that Agreement is 
replaced fully and completely. Note that the terms of your Account are subject to change (including increasing APRs/DPRs and fees, 
changing fixed APRsIDPRs to variable APRs/DPRs, and adding new terms) in accordance with the Agreement governing your Account. All

Additional Cardmembers on your Account, and keep this Notice for future reference. If you have questions regarding this Notice, please call

Determining the Prime Rate Applicable to your Account 
We are changing the timing of when we determine the Prime Rate used to calculate the variable APRs (and =responding DPRs) applicable 
to your Account. Accordingly, we are replacing subsection C of the Finance Charges section of the Sign & Traver and/or Extended 
Payment Option Agreement with the following: 
"C. The 'Prime Rate" Is determined once With respect to each billing period. The Prime Rate for each biting period is the Prime Rate 
published In the Money Rates section (or successor section) of The Wall Street Journal on (a) the first day of that billing period or (b) the 
day that Is two days prior to the Closing Date of that billing period, whichever is higher. In each case, if such a day Is not a customary 
publication day for The Wall Street Journal, we will substitute the closest preceding day that is a customary publication day. If The Wall 
Street Journal ceases or suspends publication, we may refer to the Prime Rate published in any other newspaper of general circulation 
In New York, New York, or we may substitute a similar reference rate at our sole discretion. Any increase or decrease to an APR 
resulting from a change in the Prime Rate takes effect as of the first day of the billing period. An increase in the Prime Rate means that 
the variable APRs (and corresponding DPRs) applicable to your Account will Increase and you may incur higher Finance Charges and 
may have a higher Minimum Amount Due." 
Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (Effective May 8, 2005) 
We are revising the Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges section of the Sign & Travel*  and/or Extended 
Payment Option Agreement to add the following two sentences to the end of that section: 
"In our sole discretion, we also may round any calculations made in determining the Finance Charges on your Account in any way that 
Is convenient to us. Any such rounding may apply to or cause variations in your DPRs." 
Arbitration (Effective May 8, 2005) 
We are amending certain subsections under the Arbitration section of your Agreement as follows (references to subsections below refer to 
those subsections in the Arbitration section of your Agreement): 
We are replacing the first sentence of the Definitions subsection with the following.

Payment Option Agreement, and any other related or prior agreement that you may have had with us, or the relationships resulting from 
any of the above agreements ("Agreements"), except for the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Provision or the 
Agreements' 
We are replacing the Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Administrator subsection with the following: 
"Initiation of Arbitration ProceedlngiSelectIon of Administrator; Any Claim shall be resolved, upon the election by you or us, by

referred in effect at the time the Claim Is filed (the "Code"), except to the extent the Code conflicts with this Agreement. Claims shall be

"IF ARBITRATION IS CHOSEN BY ANY PARTY WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM, NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
LITIGATE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THAT CLAIM.' 
We are adding the following two sentences to the end of the Restrictions on Arbitration subsection: 
"No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named 
party to the arbitration. Notwithstanding any other provision In this Agreement (Including but not limited to the "Continuation' provision
