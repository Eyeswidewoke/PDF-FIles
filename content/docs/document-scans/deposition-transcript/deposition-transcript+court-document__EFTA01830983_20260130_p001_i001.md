J, 
I miss you. You rock. You have no idea how much good stuff you gave me. It's amazing. I just 
wake up and have money fall on me. I don't feel like I am working at all. I am very excited to 
work though. Its fun. I love the people in my life. It would be nice if you were one of them, 
but maybe when you get organized we can spend more time together. 
I think I met my match, a guy I work with. I want to mary him. He is the only person that is not 
intimidated by me and I can pitch and catch with. I also met an amazing guy in Palm Spring, 
he is very much like you. The only difference is he talks! How cool is that? And I can cat him 
for breakfast. He is totally crazy about me. He said the way he feels when he is with me is 
more close than with his wife of 15 years. He is shocked that someone is able to understand 
and connect with him. I love it. To me its like a nice carrot for you. The best part is that I 
found a replacement to meet my needs that is very kosher. 
I have one more guy. He is a player and seems like a jerk but is actually an amazing guy. I gave 
him my date w destiny notebook and he was so grateful. He told me he completely redid his 
personal and business goals. That is so awesome. 
Ok One more guy. He is russian and we had the best sex ever. His name is Michael. I thought I 
really liked him, but then he started playing hard to get. That turns me off. I want guys who 
are crazy about me and appreciate me, not the ones I have to run after. I had enough of that. 
The poor man is driving himself nuts. He is trying to get hard to get, but is playing all by 
himself because I really don't care. It's amusing. Well at least he can introduce me to cute 
girls. His behavior reminds me of Henry. He became so uncomfortable after I cut him off. He 
feels like he has no hold on me whatsoever and he doesn't know what I will do in the future, 
if I will give him the same attention or not. 
So this is the game plan... I think I found the husband. I know what I want in terms of work. 
This year I will try to perfect my deal closing system, find out what I need to open a 
brokerage and set up referral streams. Get Paolo by the balls, I'd like to manage his life 
maybe. I'd like to do a cleanse, improve my diet and work out consistently and travel. Also I 
have so many unusual experience I like to write them down. May make good short stories.
