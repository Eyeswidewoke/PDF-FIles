thx I really appreciate it. as you=probably know terje now has to have the same procedure, that y=u were 
about to have ,when we first met met. He is very =ery stressed. 
I believe your proposal may hold promise. 1. can you prop=se a rent agreement and its terms ? lets get that 
agreed=and signed right away . 2 are there transf=r taxes or other taxes to pay on purchase. ? 3 . =C2 what are 
the normal financing ratios for homes in norway? , will the 3.5 work as equity. ? =AO . I truly understand the stress 
you are under.=C2 STAY STRONG mentally. it is doable. =AO your financail discipline needs to be accompanied by 
=alks swims. peaceful periods, othewise the money doesnt get you the constant stress does.

Facts. 
• 
There are no valid agreements re the purchase option. It has expired or=lapsed and it was never 
excersized as per its wording. the woridng is clea= and not ambiguous in any way. A lot of intentions have verbally been 
expr=ssed over some years, but the fact remains. It lapsed 2 years ago and no effort ever made to utilize it.=C2 
• 
The property is mortgaged and the lending bank i have will not cle=r the property mortgage 
unless realized at market value. The market value =s per Bank assesment is NOK 18 mill. 
• 
Terje has a tennant agreement that has expired, but he will have t=e right to rent the property 
on terms to be agreed ( reduced rent) and I w=ll not make any objection or hindrances. This we could and should do to 
fi= the situation. renew this agreement. 
However given the situation leading to your request i send you this for=discussion 
Situation: 
• 
Terje is in very urgent needs and wants to take over the property no= . if so we have to meet up 
and discuss and agree on revised terms. I simply cannot deliver as per his wishes right now, =ut i can stick to agreements 
already in place. My ambition was to work out=my other problems and then help Terje to meet his wishes. i am more 
than s=ightly embarassed by the situation now created. 
Solution: 
• 
What i can see us doing now is that he buys the property at NOK =4 mill. 
• 
i will settle the difference with the bank; difference between NOK=18 and NOK 14 mill. 
• 
The NOK 3.5 mill deposit that Terje paid, that is now in need of a=dicsussion on how to settle. it 
is as per above mentioned agreement a non =efundable. I do suggest you lend him this money and i will repay you the 
m=ney in due course. Suggest we dicsuss these terms when we meet. 
1. 
for Terje; he has to pay NOK 14 mill vrs NOK 13 mill he wants to pay. H= gets the property he 
wants despite of the inconvenience of timing.
