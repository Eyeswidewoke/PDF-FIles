guarantor, then the S&P Rating of the Collateral Obligation or Collateral Obligation will 
be one subcategory below such rating; (b) if there is not a rating by S&P on a senior 
secured obligation of the Obligor or its guarantor, but there is a rating by S&P on a senior

if an obligation of the Obligor or its guarantor is publicly rated by 
Moody's, then the S&P Rating will be determined in accordance with the 
methodologies for establishing the Moody's Rating set forth above, except that 
the S&P Rating of such obligation will be (1) one subcategory below the S&P 
equivalent of the rating assigned by Moody's if such security is rated "Baa3" or 
higher by Moody's and (2) two subcategories below the S&P equivalent of the 
rating assigned by Moody's if such security is rated "Bal" or lower by Moody's; 
provided that Collateral Obligations constituting no more than 10')/0 of the
