So sorry I did not call. 
I got in about 5:30pm and ran out to a cocktail party at 6:30pm....and was in the middle of 
dealing with a lunch for Stephen Daldry on Wed., Jan. 4th. I left my make up case on the 
plane....that's the trials of going Jet Blue...and went out with one black eye. This did not 
bother me, but freaks people out. 
Annette Tapert and Joe Allen offered to drive me to this third rate cocktail party they told me 
about and it was a bit of a nightmare. 
Annette started bragging about a recent trip to LA where she had lunch with her new best friend 
Diane Keaton. She later let it slip out that she had not met before and that Wendy Stark had 
invited her. They then had dinner with Jane Fonda (because Joe Allen went to college with 
her very weird very boring boy friend music producer Richard Perry) and Annette's own 
daughter (which meant she paid for it) gave her a cocktail party. Wendy also gave her a dinner 
and a lunch. It was inane. Celebrations in her honor for flying to LA...for doing nothing. 
Annette came from nowhere, married an idiot years ago because she thought he had money, then 
broke up Katherine Rayner's marriage to the awful and poor journalist Jesse Kombluth and 
then landed Joe Allen, a retired rich cousin of Peter Brant who he sold his share of their paper 
business to. Joe collects art, plays golf and is also beyond boring. 
They drove me to a horrible party....and drove me back to Koch's by 8:00pm...I could 
have/should have made dinner plans. They said they were tired from getting in late from LA 
the night before.. (Kochs arrive Thursday). I swear they went to another party...I don't know 
whether I was vomiting from the manufactured self glorification at bad social events (poor, 
fat, aging, drunk and totally fun Wendy Stark is hardly the arbiter of LA society anymore but 
she still thinks she is...and the most horrific aspect of the night....in the car, on the way home 
Joe started asking me about my brother. Then he asked me how much the Alpine house was 
on the market for....even though I lied by a million, I was humiliated I even answered him. 
You could hear the silent laughter. Then they asked me about Mattie...I had dinner with her 
Tuesday night in Williamsburg...and she is terrific and we are planning her third job in the art 
department of a major film....and I told them Dr. Harold Klopowitz told me if we can get thru 
24 and happy and healthy...she has a good chance of not having another "episode"....why was 
I spilling my guts to these obnoxious nosy people who don't give a shit about me. 
I think I left Palm Beach at Christmas four years ago when you started sending Mattie and me 
around the world....which changed/enriched my life.
