You know that Mr Rothstein destroyed people's lives with his fantastic and untrue suits and 
that in pursuit of his evil, greedy plans he corrupted ex policemen to create fake cases and 
forged the signatures of judges to sign off on those charges. Rothstein's plea related to, AMONGST 
OTHER THINGS, CREATING AND PROMOTING fake legal settlements AND SELLING interests in those 
settlements TO UNSUSPECTING INVESTORS. Rothstein engaged in these CORRUPT ILLEAGAL AND 
SHAMELESS SCHEMES UNDERNEATH THE UMBREALLA OF A LEGAL PRACTICE TO STEAL MONEY. HE, AND 
OTHERS IN HIS FIRM, DEMONSTRATED AN EXPLOITATION OF THE U.S. LEGAL SYSTEM THAT USED AND 
CREATED FAKE 'VICTIMS' TO PROMOTE HIS ILLEGAL AND LIFE DESTROYING , FAKE SUITS. FBI 
Investigations continue into the now defunct firm, those who worked for the firm, and many of the ex 
partners of Rothstein's firm are subject to legal and civil proceedings. You will be aware that Mr. 
Edwards himself, faces a professional investigation and serious potential charges brought by 
Mr Epstein. 
civil suit against Mr Epstein, along with her allegations in it, emerged IN THE 
PUBLIC DOMAIN at the time that Scott Rothstein was creating HIS false claims. If you write a 
balanced article, you will be bound to record that Ms Roberts has made years pReviously sexual 
harrasment claims against people other than Mr Epstein and that they were thrown out of 
court for her lack of credibility. You will also, presumably, draw attention to the fact that, prior 
to filing her civil suit against Mr Epstein, and long after she allegedly ceased to be employed by 
him as a masseuse, Ms Roberts fled the US to avoid being arrested and presumably be sent to 
jail for grand theft. Also i think it is probably fair to mention that she has been paid a large 
sum of money by at least one British national newspaper, aside from any other monies that she 
has received, which represents a further incentive to make any claims that would help keep her 
name in the public domain by attempting to link her to Prince Andrew and have what she has to 
to say be worth any money to those seeking to use her for their own means. All in all, given her 
record, which includes a number of other highly colourful events, (of which I have no doubt you 
will be aware and will reflect) I assume you will treat what she says with great scepticism. 
TO this point Ms Roberts was I believe actually 17 and living with her fiance when Mr Epstein first 
employed her as a Masseuse. When it comes to Ms Roberts allegations about her time in 
London, I can't say i remember being in London with her at all and neither can I remember 
flying with her. i fly thousands of miles a year all over the world and would be hard pushed to 
say what plane and with whom I was flying even with in the last year. Of course, I've seen the 
photograph of the Duke of York with 
but I have absolutely no recollection at all 
of the photograph being taken. 
i've met the Duke of York on a number of occasions but whenever I've seen him he has been 
fully and properly attired and I have no knowledge of naked pool parties, unless one considers 
the odd person sunbathing without a swimming costume a party, at Mr Epstein's home. 
As to my relationship with Mr Epstein, I can tell you that i do not share any homes anywhere 
with Mr Epstein; he does not support me in any way at all. For the record I had in fact, until 
very recently, been in a committed and happy relationship for the last seven years with 
someone else. Mr Epstein's imprisonment and the circumstances to which that related occurred 
many years after our relationship had ceased.
