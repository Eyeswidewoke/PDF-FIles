reality. But there can be no transcendence of realization: no distinction between observation and its object. No differentiation: 
there was never anyone but me talking to me of me. And me: I go where the words go: nowhere. There is no final perfection, 
no answer. No one. 
ficcOur kind of innovation consists not in the answers, but in the true novelty of the questions themselves; in the statement of 
problems, not in their solutions.fio What is important is not ficeto illustrate a truthror even an interrogationi"known in 
advance, but to bring to the world certain interrogations . .. not yet known as such to themselvesP 
A total synthesis of all human knowledge will not result in fantastic amounts of data, or in huge libraries filled with books. 
Therein's no value any more in amount, in quantity, in explanation. For a total synthesis of human knowledge, use the 
interrogative. Ask the most subtle sensibilities in the world what questions they are asking themselves. 
The words have no author. aceThere are words better without an author, without a poet, or having a separate author, a 
different poet, an accretion from ourselves, intelligent, beyond intelligence, an artificial man.fi6'3 The words have no author. 
The book is a lie. ItaTMs a performance: by a reader. Reader is a comfort word and the author has no intention of its meaning. 
Author is a comfort word and the author has no intention of its meaning. 
An accretion from ourselves, intelligent, by an intelligence, an artificial man. Unreal realization: ficefreedom is like a man who 
kills himself each night, an incessant butcher.a" Artificial manaTMs not himself unreal realization. He is revealed, secularized 
as a thing, an object. aceHe has lost the whole in which he was containcd.tt' He has shed his human clothes. 
Just as the ancients peopled the universe, we have set out to empty it of all life. ItaTMs a finite world of words: there is no life 
in man, there is no existence in things, there is no evolution in nature. Man is dead: ficedrowned in the depth of things (of 
himself), man ultimately no longer even perceives them: his role is soon limited to experiencing, in their name, totally 
humanized impressions and desircs.a7' But there is no depth in things. Words are what count: the word must be the thing it 
represents. Words are finite: there can be no depth, no interiority. 
TherefiTms no perfection in humanity. Man was considered the perfect center in a world of infinite things, infinite depth. But 
man has been rooted out of his human home, disallowed his humanistic habit. Man is dead: he is ficethinged,a he is artificial: 
he mocks his own meaning, heaTMs not to be believed. 
But humanism attempts ficeto recover everything, including whatever attempts to retrace its limits, even to impugn it as a 
whole.O No matter what: there is man and his nature. And ficea common nature must be the eternal answer to the single 
question of our civilizationfi"only one possible answer to everything: man.fi 
This humanistic attitude is considered the inevitable attitude of the emancipated and instructed man. But answers are no 
answer: thereaTMs no perfection in humanity. ficeMan is an extraordinarily fixed and limited animal, whose nature is absolutely 
constant.P A veritable object. ficeMan is a sick animal:fi to think he can be cured is to ficeimprison him in the disease:a—
What was an animal? It is the human that is alien, the human that has a cousin on the moon, kethe human that demands 
speech from beasts and the incommunicable mass.P
