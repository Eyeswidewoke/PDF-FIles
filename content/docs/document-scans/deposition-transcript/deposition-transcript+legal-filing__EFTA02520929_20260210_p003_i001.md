The only tool they have is money or suing me. Suing me is hard but hardly impossible. The only variable is that 
suing me means a deposition for Steve. But if they don't sue me then they have to sue everyone who leaves with me. 
That they don't prefer. 
I think: 
• $15m to me is fair and reasonable since it was comp i earned modulo the proxy bullshit which drops 125,000 
or so shares. For negotiation more than happy to say "plus 5m cash". I don't care about the timeline. Id set up an 
automatic escrow account so I don't have to go back to them. 
• Not working at apple, google until 2014 is fine 
• Cooperating and not poaching is fine 
• The timeline doesn't matter so long as jay is driving and not letting brad stall. That's new since jay is dragging 
now. 
I can say yes to Samsung with an agreement. If we don't have an agreement I will get sued going to Samsung. 
They know it and i know it. If not then tell me why not? 
I think they should agree not to sue other microsoft people who leave to the same company as me. That's new. 
That's added because of the way they structured the gag order. If I can't talk to them about stuff then i can't be 
recruiting them. If i go to Samsung they can't now declare that a competitor because of me. People can quit and join 
other companies.

no secret I texted melz. I woudl like you to succeed , which means only to get what you want, that is for you 
to decide. I think it is a sensitce negotiation, therefore even more important to decide on your persaonl prioirites. get 
it closed, is ok, but if that message comes out in the wrong way , it wil do you more harm than good . One moment you 
say it has to get closed and the next you say im not impatient. If I can help I will , It appears as if you think i am beating 
up on you , no thanks . thank you , or the merest sign of appreciation, I will play any role you choose, except for the 
villain. I will take total control and leave you out if thats what you prefer. you are too close, and worried about press, 
lawsuits, gossip, percieved slights. I actully know how difficult this is for you, and if i were a girl woudl give you a hug,. 
This is not life and death, things will be ok ,
