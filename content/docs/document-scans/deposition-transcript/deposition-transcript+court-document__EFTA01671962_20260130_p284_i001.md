Detail of Changes to Your Agreements 
We're revising agreements governing your account terms and benefits as described below. Any language in your 
agreements that conflicts with these changes is replaced fully and completely. Language not changed by this 
notice remains in full force and effect. These changes apply to existing and future balances on your account. We 
encourage you to read this notice, share it with additional cardmembers on your account, and file it for future 
reference. 
Paying Interest 
As of the effective date shown on the preceding page, the When we charge interest subsection of the About 
interest charges on Pay Over Time balances section in Part 2 of your Cardmember Agreement is replaced with 
the following: 
For transactions added to pay over time balances at your request (for example, Select & Pay 
Later), we charge interest from the date they are added to a pay over time balance until they are paid. 
For transactions added automatically to a pay over time balance (for example. Sign & Travel 
and Extended Payment Option), we charge interest from the transaction date until they are paid. 
However, we will not charge interest on these transactions if: 
. your Pay Over Time Previous Balance for the billing period is zero; or 
• you paid the Account Total Previous Balance for each of the previous two billing periods in full 
by the dosing date shown on their respective statements. 
Minimum Monthly Payment 
Effective July 1, 2012, the Adjusting your Pay Over Time Minimum Due section in Pail 2 of your Cardmember 
Agreement is deleted and the How we calculate your Minimum Payment Due section is replaced with: 
The Minimum Payment Due is the Pay In Full amount plus any Pay Over Time Minimum Due. To 
calculate the Pay Over Time Minimum Due for each statement, we start with the higher of: 
1) interest charged on the statement plus 1% of the Pay Over Time New Balance (excluding 
interest on the statement): or 
2) $35. 
Then we round to the nearest dollar and add any Pay Over Time amount past due. Your Pay Over 
Time Minimum Due will not exceed your Pay Over Time New Balance. You may pay more than 
the Minimum Payment Due, up to your entire outstanding balance, at any time. 
EXAMPLE: Assume that you have a Pay Over Time New Balance of $3,000, interest of $29.57, no 
amounts past due, and a $400 Pay In Full amount 
1) $29.57 + 1% x ($3,000 - $29.57) = $59.27 
2) $35 
The higher of (1) or (2) is $59.27, which rounds to $59.00. The Pay Over Time Minimum Due of 
$59.00 plus the Pay in Full amount of $400 together make up the Minimum Payment Due of $459.00. 
ATM Withdrawals 
Effective July 1, 2012, the Limits on withdrawals section of your Agreement for Transferring Funds Electronically 
is amended by replacing each instance of "S1,000 in a 7-day period" with "S3,000 in a 30-day period" and 
replacing each instance of "$2,500 in a 7-day period" with "$8,500 in a 30-day period". 
Membership Rewards Reinstatement Fee 
Effective July 1, 2012. in Paragraph 2 of the Point Forfeiture for Late Payment section of the Membership 
Rewards Terms 8 Conditions, 129' is replaced with "$35".
