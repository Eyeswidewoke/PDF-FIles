campaigns and candidates." Using traditional news outlets and social media, they are trying to 
"sway U.S. voters' preferences and perspectives, to shift U.S. policies, to increase discord and 
to undermine confidence in our democratic process," he said. Evanina added that "the 
coronavirus pandemic and recent protests...continue to serve as fodder for foreign influence 
and disinformation efforts in America." 
Reuters (7/24, Hosenball) reports Evanina said "it was `imperative' his agency share with 
voters some of the information about possible interference that U.S. spies have given to 
campaigns and legislators." He explained, "the American public has a role to play in securing 
the election, particularly in maintaining vigilance against foreign influence...At the most basic 
level, we encourage Americans to consume information with a critical eye, check out sources 
before reposting or spreading messages, practice good cyber hygiene and media literacy, and 
report suspicious election-related activity to authorities." 
The AP (7/24, Jalonick) reports Congressional Democrats released a letter Friday in 
response to Evanina's comments, urging the Trump Administration "to make a 'concrete and 
specific statement' to inform voters ahead of the 2020 contest." The letter "did not detail 
exactly what they want the administration to say," but "said Evanina's statement `does not go 
nearly far enough in arming the American people with the knowledge they need about how 
foreign powers are seeking to influence our political process' and falsely paints the three 
countries as equivalent in their efforts." 
China Seizes Assets Of Property Tycoon Who Criticized Xi. The New York Times 
(7/24, Hernandez, 18.61M) reports that the Chinese Communist Party has "expelled an 
outspoken and prominent property tycoon who denounced the country's authoritarian leader, Xi 
Jinping, paving the way for his criminal prosecution and escalating its efforts to quash dissent 
among the elite." According to the Times, the party "announced the expulsion of the tycoon, 
Ren Zhiqiang, late Thursday, and said that it had seized his assets for `serious violations of 
discipline and law' that included the possession of golf club memberships." The Times adds, 
"Officials also took aim at Mr. Ren's family, accusing him of `colluding with his children to 
accumulate wealth without restraint." 
Trade Becomes A Point Of Stability As US-China Relations Fray Over Corona virus, 
Accusations Of Espionage. The New York Times (7/25, Swanson, Bradsher, 18.61M) reports 
that "trade, long the most contentious part of the U.S.-China relationship, has suddenly become 
an area of surprising stability" as relations between Washington and Beijing fray "over the 
coronavirus, which the Trump administration accuses China of failing to control, as well as 
accusations of espionage, intellectual property theft and human rights violations." The article 
says, "Neither side is threatening to rip up the initial trade deal they signed in January, which 
took years of painful negotiations to complete," though "the reasons have more to do with 
politics than diplomacy. Both the Trump administration and Chinese leaders invested time and 
political capital in reaching their initial trade deal." As a result, "both sides appear to think they 
have more to lose from rupturing the agreement than they would gain." 
US, Chinese Officials Pushing Countries Toward New Era of Confrontation. In a 
front-page article, the New York Times (7/25, Wong, Myers, 18.61M) reports, "The United 
States and China are dismantling decades of political, economic and social engagement, setting 
the stage for a new era of confrontation shaped by the views of the most hawkish voices on 
both sides." With President Trump down in polls ahead of the election, "his national security 
officials have intensified their attack on China in recent weeks, targeting its officials, diplomats 
and executives. While the strategy has reinforced a key campaign message, some American 
officials...are also trying to engineer irreversible changes, according to people familiar with the 
thinking." Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping "has inflamed the fight, brushing aside 
international concern about the country's rising authoritarianism to consolidate his own political 
power and to crack down on basic freedoms. ... By doing so, he has hardened attitudes in 
Washington, fueling a clash that at least some in China believe could be dangerous to the 
country's interests."
