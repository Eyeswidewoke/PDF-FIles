The Oscar backstory that can not be told....or emailed to others. 
Here is my Oscar wrap up only sent to a few close friends....Steven, let me=know what you think...and do not think less 
of me for writing about you. 
Harvey Weinstein is a genius. 
He kept "The Artist" campaign going from a May premiere in Cannes all the w=y to February. 
His team told him he could win Best Picture back in France but he had to se= Eastwood, Spielberg, Scorsese, Daldry, 
Payne and Fincher's work. We had =ust seen Woody Allen and Terry Malick's films in Cannes, which were conten=ers for 
nominations, but not slam dunk winners.. 
Any one of those six brilliant directors could walk away with the gold...an= guess what? None of them handed in a film 
good enough to beat "The Artis=" nor could their studios run an extended convincing campaign. 
"The Artist" is just a delightful clever highly entertaining film...that wa= the best of a weak year. 
Eastwood was out of the race very early. The make-up man undermining Leo an= the production designer and/or the 
director forgetting to light the night=scenes did not help. 
"Tree of Life" has the pedigree of mysterious Malick and the Palm d'Or, but=never touched the American audience. 
"Midnight in Paris", Woody's highest grossing film ever, could have won the=Oscar in Harvey hands with Owen Wilson 
working and Woody just showing up a= the Oscars. If Woody had allowed Sony Classics to show voters the new 3 h=ur 
PBS documentary on his 40 films, he could have won best film. The docum=ntary shows you Woody's astonishing depth 
of talent. Instead, Woody insis=ed voters find the documentary on TV Thanksgiving weekend. No one noticed.=20 
Harvey would have secretly slipped the dvd under ever voters door. 
Best Screenplay was the least the Academy could do for the recluse. 
How Marty could spend 170 million on a failed visual masterpiece with no pa=ing is a crime. His DP (who won an Oscar) 
failed him by shooting and enabl=ng endless tracking shots that stalled the story. The first 25 minutes cou=d have been 
5. Film did not pick up pace till second act. Marty personally=campaigned endlessly as the revered professor of film 
history and a new au=hority on 3-D. Always bringing his adored Helen with him, who's physical =ondition tragically 
weakened everyday made everyone very sad. 
Spielberg's "War Horse" has fantastic combat footage in the middle and farm=ouse bookends that are too corny and 
slow. He told Disney to set up "epic"=film making and evoked John Ford and David Lean as his inspiration which d=d not 
register with voters. I saw the film five times and fell for it. Th= small amount of people who also saw the play were 
visually stuck with the=image of theatrical puppets and would not accept anyone's cinematic vision= Kathy Kennedy 
confessed to me last Thursday night in LA at The Hollywood=Reporter's Oscar nominee party that she and Steven 
ultimately blamed thems=lves for casting Jeremy Irvine who was too old, too pretty and could carry=the 
film....completely missing the schmaltz factor and length that did the= in. Ultimately, one boy and one horse in a brutal 
war did not ring true.=20
