Cultures unfortunately can be swept by craziness. Na=ism for example. Or the Great Awakening. We're in one of t=ose 
phases now. If there's a charge, it's true, in fact True= Any response is "mansplaining," another power play, reinf=rcing 
the charge. You've seen I'm sure what happened to Lawr=nce. Full and complete response, amounts to zero. Isn't ev=n
