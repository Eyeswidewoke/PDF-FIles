Words do not signify anything but their own reality. Words do not create the universe out of nothing but out of all. All 
possibilities exist in any: seethe whole story from Genesis to Apocalypse in any event; in any metamorphoses. Therefore it is 
important to keep changing the subject. The subject changes before our very eyes.A2')
What is: is something else. Finite man: he has no interest in what exists. He has no time for what is. No beginning, no ending. 
He lives without life: the story of life. ItaTMs over: never began. ItaTMs not a physical death, a physical end. ItaTMs simply that 
Ancto tell a story has become strictly impossible:am ItaTMs a world of words: saying is inventing . . you invent nothing!' 
Saying makes it so:" 
Beyond the world: a world of words with no beyond. No psychic walls of lands. No incommunicable mass of weitTms. A 
finite world of words: a sense of limit, a limit which does not energize subject matter, but penetrates it, dissolves it, creating 
both dream and reality, life and death. A finite world of words: you canaTMt tell where the subject is, you caning tell what 
the subject is. 
Reject the world. Metaphysical I instead: no part, but limit. Reject the world. Reject man. Be faithful to the conception of a 
limit. The new finite view of man: the rejection of humanism (doctrine that man is the measure): a complete 
anthropomorphization of the world, whether pantheism, idealism, or rationalism. Reject man. Reject the world. Reject the 
thinking subject for limit, the limit of language, a world created in what it says. acelaTMm in words, made of words, otherirms 
words ... IaTMm all these words, all these strangers.A24
Man is no longer necessary. Neither are you. Man is dead: he is totally deprived. Of himself, even of nothing. There is 
nowhere to go in the absurdity of his lifetime. Any new style, any new life, any new world, is but a god where gods are no 
longer valid. AceThe god that one so finds is but a word born of words, and returns to the word. For the reply we make to 
ourselves is assuredly never anything other than the question itselfle 
Reject world as unit. There is no phenomenal world as an external point of reference, of support. There is no possible 
communication between these illusory points. Communication is impossible: acethe thing said and the thing heard have a 
common source/Al(' And itaTMs not an inventing mind, a thinking subject. Metaphysical I instead: no part, but limit. Me: I do it 
all in my head: what head? 
ficeA world full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.a27 It points to nothing other than the fact that it is. ItaTMs not a 
metaphor. kers nothing you can believe in. It is. The moment you let it out of your head, itirms dead: itaTMs real. 
Reject life actin any number of a"worldsaTM or a`universes:TM or in trifling delusions such as a`past,aTM fpresent,aTM or 
tthwre.ATMa ItaTMs all denied. Finite man in a finite world. Or, finite man as finite world. 
The world is unintelligible. keit is impossible to include it all under one large counter such as rGodaTM or A-TruthaTm and 
other verbalisms, or the disease of the symbolic language.a2r All such words are comfort words. The world is unintelligible. 
There is no one way, no one. The world is unintelligible: the world is our intelligence. accHere, now, we forget each other and 
ourselves. We feel the absurdity of an order, a whole, a knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous, within its vital
