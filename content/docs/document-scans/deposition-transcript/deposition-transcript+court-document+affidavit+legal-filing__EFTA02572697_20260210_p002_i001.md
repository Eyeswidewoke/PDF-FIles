Our top investment recommendation remains =o be aggressively overweight equities versus cash and 
fixed income. But b=yond that, we have concentrated much of our tactical risk on country and r=gional allocations. How 
do we allocate here? What is working, or not worki=g? And where are we considering change? 
• 
Our top regional allocation has been to underweight EM against DM across asset classes. The rationale 
has be=n predominantly fundamental in that we and the consensus have been forced =o steadily lower our growth 
expectations in EM, outright and relative to D=. We do not yet have reason to change this assessment. The past few 
weeks of lower EM PMIs and the weak t=acking of Q3 activity data versus forecasts leave us with further downside=risks 
on EM growth projections. 
• 
This week alone, we cut Mexico and Russia.=EM policy makers on average will likely not provide much 
support, in some =ountries because inflation remains too high, and in others because capital=outflows have put 
downside pressure on the currency that is preventing their central banks from easin= rates. In addition, as reviewed in 
Job gains to lag global growth lift, Kasman et al., July 24, we see =ailing EM profit margins, in response to tight labor 
markets and rising wa=e costs, also depressing EM growth. 
• 
That said, we will not remain underweight =M forever, as relative value is getting re-established, many 
active invest=rs are already UW, and at some point, the rebound in DM should pull EM out=of its funk. This week's data 
dump from China is providing support for our projected rebound in gro=th from Hl*s 6.5% to 7.5% in H2. EM equities 
are still underperforming t=is week, but at a slower pace now. EM is holding itself vs. DM in credit a=d FX over the past 
month. 
• 
We think it too early to move back to OW E= asset classes, given still downside risk on EM forecasts, and 
are instead=trimming UWs selectively, especially in fixed income and FX.

Our European overweight is working =icely and is getting good support from economic data. This week 
alone prov=ded upside surprises on economic activity data, allowing us to raise Q2 to=1% in the Euro area. The 
challenge we all face on Europe, after years of crisis and recession, =s whether the rebound is a *dead cat bounce*, born
