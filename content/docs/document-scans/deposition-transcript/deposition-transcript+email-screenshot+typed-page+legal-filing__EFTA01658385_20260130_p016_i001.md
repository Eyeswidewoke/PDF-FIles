Fox News (8/27, Ruiz, 27.59M) reports, "The Marshals assisted state and local authorities 
in a number of separate cases during the operation. The federal authorities periodically assist 
police with federal resources to help clear separate missing persons cases in a single operation. 
Authorities said the missing children were at high risk of child sex trafficking, exploitation and 
abuse - and some suffered from medical and mental health conditions." Fox News adds, "The 
2015 Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act gave the Marshal's broader authority to assist state 
and local police departments tracking down missing children, regardless of whether fugitives or 
sex offenders are involved in the case, officials said." 
WGXA-TV Macon, GA (8/27, 656) reports, "The operation was made with joint efforts from 
The U.S. Marshals Service Missing Child Unit (USMS), in conjunction with the agency's 
Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children 
(NCMEC) and Georgia state and local agencies. The operation was two-weeks long and was 
conducted in August." The operation "was the culmination of several months of planning and 
coordination between the USMS, NCMEC, Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Georgia Office of the 
Attorney General, Georgia Department of Family and Children Services, Georgia Department of 
Juvenile Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta." 
WMAZ-TV Macon, GA (8/27, Plaskowsky, 138K) reports, "US Marshals Director Donald 
Washington said that over the course of the two-week operation in August, 26 missing and 
endangered children were recovered, 13 children were safely located and a total of 9 people 
were arrested. Washington said some of those arrested face charges ranging from sex

One person was taken into custody. Multiple agencies said the incident involved a shooting, but
