No one serving as the Trustee of any trust under this Agreement shall be accountable or 
responsible to any person interested in any trust hereunder for the manner in which the Trustees 
shall in good faith exercise any discretionary authority or any power of the Trustees. No one 
serving as the Trustee of any trust under this Agreement shall be liable for any loss or 
depreciation in value occasioned by reason of any negligence, error or mistake of judgment in 
entering into any transaction, in making any sale or investment, in continuing to hold any 
property, or by reason of any action or omission, whether by the Trustees or any other fiduciary, 
unless such Trustee has acted in bad faith. In the absence of proof by affirmative evidence to the 
contrary, each Trustee shall be deemed to have acted within the scope of the Trustees' authority, 
to have exercised reasonable care, diligence, and prudence and to have acted impartially as to 
all interested persons. A Trustee shall not be liable for the acts or defaults of another Trustee. 
In the event a legal action is brought against any individual serving as the Trustee of any

defense of such legal action shall be paid by such trust without court authorization; provided, 
however, that (a) no such payment shall (or shall continue to) be made if a court enters an order 
prohibiting such payment, and (b) such Trustee shall refund to the trust any such payments that 
previously had been made if a court enters an order directing that such payments be refunded, 
or if a court concludes that such Trustee acted in bad faith.
