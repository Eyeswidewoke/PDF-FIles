Re: 
understanding is a multi dimensional space =AO the language is a projection in that space. or =n arrow in category 
theory. 
the local point has hi=tory . so like the play appears different from every sea= in the theatre the 
integaration over each point=C2 projects his understanding on the language.

It yielded most of the progress we saw until recently:=chess programs, data bases, language parsers etc.
