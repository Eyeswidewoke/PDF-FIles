each band member made for a transcendence of what might be called "free form" and 
improvisation. Their concert sets often blended songs, one into the next (a segue). 
Concert sound systems 
The Wall of Sound was an enormous sound system designed specifically for the Grateful Dead. 
The band was never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played. After the Monterey 
Pop Festival, the band's crew 'borrowed' some of the other performers' sound equipment and 
used it to host some free shows in San Francisco. In their early days, soundman Owsley "Bear" 
Stanley designed a public address and monitor system for them. Bear was the Grateful Dead's 
soundman for many years; he was also one of the largest suppliers of LSD. Stanley's sound 
systems were delicate and finicky, and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical 
breakdowns. After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used 
house PM, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman. 
In 1971, the band purchased their first solid-state sound system from Alembic Inc. Studios. 
Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and 
production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed Dan Healy into the fold on a 
permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993. 
Tapes 
Like several other bands during this time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their 
shows. For many years the tapers set up their microphones wherever they could. The eventual 
forest of microphones became a problem for the official sound crew. Eventually this was solved 
by having a dedicated taping section located behind the soundboard, which required a special 
"tapers" ticket. The band allowed sharing of tapes of their shows, as long as no profits were 
made on the sale of their show tapes. Sometimes the sound crew would allow the tapers to 
connect directly to the soundboard, which created exceptional concert recordings. Recently, 
there have been some disputes over which recordings archive.org could host on their site. 
Currently, all recordings are hosted, though soundboard recordings are not available for 
download, but rather in a streaming format. 
Of the approximately 2,35o shows the Grateful Dead played, almost 2,2OO were taped, and most 
of these are available online. The Band began collecting and cataloging tapes early on and Dick 
Latvala was their keeper. Latvala is whom Dick's Pick is named. After his death in 1999, David 
Lemieux gradually took the post. Concert set lists from a subset of 1,590 Grateful Dead shows 
were used to perform a comparative analysis between how songs were played in concert and 
how they are listened online by Last.fm members. In their book Marketing Lessons from the 
Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn From the Most Iconic Band in History,[64] 
David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan identify the taper section as a crucial idea in increasing 
the Grateful Dead's fan base. 
Artwork 
Owsley "Bear" Stanley wrote that the "dancing bears" designed by Bob Thomas for History of 
the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear's Choice) are marching, not dancing. Over the years, a 
number of iconic images have come to be associated with the Grateful Dead. Many of these 
images originated as artwork for concert posters or album covers.
