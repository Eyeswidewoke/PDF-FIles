Weeks After FBI Raid, Feds File Forfeiture Action Against Rhode Island Immigration Lawyer's House 
The Providence Journal (02/05, Mulvaney) reported that weeks after agents raided his office in Providence, RI, 
federal authorities filed a forfeiture action against the $1.2 million East Greenwich home of immigration lawyer and 
former Central Falls municipal court judge Joseph Molina Flynn. Federal prosecutors on Tuesday filed the complaint

appraisal. The article revealed that Molina Flynn's lawyer noted that no charges have been filed against him and 
said he just learned of the latest federal action targeting his client's "primary" residence Tuesday. The article
