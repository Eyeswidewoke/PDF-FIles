down, but it was too late, since Sindona had also sent an anonymous letter to the Bank of Italy 
detailing the transactions. The Bank of Italy, the central bank of Italy, had no choice but to launch 
an investigation. For the next 15 months, its investigators would question Calvi about these 
transactions 
Meanwhile, the court-appointed liquidator of Sindona's banks, Mario Ambrosoli, reported 
that he had found coded evidence in Sindona's records of a $6.5 million illegal payoff to an 
"American bishop and Milanese banker." The press suggested that this referred to Bishop 
Marcinkus and Banker Calvi. Before he could go further in unraveling the code, Ambrosoli was 
shot dead at point blank range in front of his home by two unidentified men. While his evidence 
may have been problematic, his silencing further amplified the furor over the posters. 
Marcinkus' position was further weakened by a series of unfortunate events in the Vatican. 
First, Pope Paul, who had supported Marcinkus, died in August 1978. Shortly afterwards, his 
successor Pope John Paul, also abruptly died. Then the election of the first non-Italian Pope in 
seven centuries, John Paul II, left the Curia in disarray. Then Luigi Mennini, who was then was 
the chief aide to Marcinkus at the Vatican bank, was arrested in Italy for currency manipulation. 
As the pressure built, the new Pope appointed a commission of 15 cardinals to study the finances 
of the Vatican. Under these circumstances, it was becoming increasingly difficult to keep 
hidden the relationship between the Vatican bank and the Banco Ambrosiano. 
There was also little the "Milanese banker" could do to avert the Sword of Damocles 
descending on him. Calvi, after using every legal tactic to delay the investigation, was arrested 
on May 21, 1981, along with top executives at his bank, and charged with violating Italy's 
foreign exchange regulations a decade earlier. He was then taken to the medieval Lodi prison 
and put into a cell with four terrorists, who kept him awake day and night with their ravings and 
radio. Calvi, desperately seeking help from the Vatican, told Marcinkus, "This trial is called 
1OR," the Italian initials of the Vatican Bank. Marcinkus sent a message back, according to 
Calvi's son, Carlos Calvi, saying "Our problems are your problems too." 
Calvi then attempted 
suicide by slashing his wrists and swallowing an overdose of barbiturates. 
Finally, on July 201h 1981, after spending two months in Lodi, Calvi, though sentenced by a 
court to four years in prison, was released on bail while his appeal was processed. 
Within a week, he was reinstated as chairman of the Banco Ambrosiano by its Board of 
Directors. The Bank of Italy, while approving his reappointment, warned him that if he failed to 
restore the financial soundness of his bank, he would almost certainly face another harsh 
imprisonment. Yet, though the Bank of Italy did not know it, there was by now a gaping $900 
million hole in Banco Ambrosiano's books. This money was in theory owed to its the overseas 
subsidiaries by The Vatican bank but Calvi had so deeply hid the paper trail through a labyrinth 
of anonymous off-shore entities that the Vatican bank was refusing to recognize the debt. And 
even if it did, it did not have the $900 million to plug the hole. So technically both banks were 
bankrupt, but the plight of these banks was not yet known to the public. Calvi's bank indeed still 
had over $5 billion in deposits and a stock market value of nearly $3 billion. In June 1982, the 
Bank of Italy demanded to see the books of the bank's overseas subsidiaries, and his Board of 
Directors had agreed to produce them. With the legal appeal keeping him out of prison rapidly 
expiring, Calvi's clock had all but run out. Calvi had one move yet to play: He vanished.
