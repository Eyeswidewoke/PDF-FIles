S- I/A 
Table of Contrail 
On November 12. 2014. the Committee adopted amendments to the Policy, which were effective commencing on January 1, 2015. 
Under the new terms, the cash severance payment for all eligible participants is equal to one year's base pay plus the cash bonus paid to the NEO, 
if any. for the year immediately preceding the year in which the termination occurs and a prorated portion of the cash bonus paid to the NEC), if 
any, for the year immediately preceding the year in which the termination occurs based on time worked during the year of termination. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
During 2014. Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) limitations on tax deductibility of compensation did not apply to the Company as 
none of its common stock was registered or publicly-traded. The Committee has not considered Internal Revenue Code 
Section 162(m) deductibility limitations in the planning of 2015 compensation since they do not apply. 
Compensation Actions During 2015 
In January 2015. the Committee granted the following annual equity-based awards to the NEOs under the 2007 Equity Plan.

Equity-Based Grants in Connection with this Offering 
In connection with this offering, we expect to make equity-based retention grants under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan to all of our 
executive officers, including all of our named executive officers (other than Mr. Plumeri), which will provide a mix of non-qualified stock options 
and restricted stock (which restricted stock awards entitle the holder thereof to the rights and privileges of a stockholder other than dividend rights 
which do not begin to acetate until the shares are vested). Mr. Patel. who was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer on September 11, 2015, will 
also be receiving equity-based retention grants in connection with this offering. Two thirds of each grant of stock options and restricted stock will 
be subject to time-based vesting conditions and one
