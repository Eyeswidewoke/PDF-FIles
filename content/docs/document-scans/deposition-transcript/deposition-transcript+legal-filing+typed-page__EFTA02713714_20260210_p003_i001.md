Over the past 15 years, Moroccan real GDP per 
capita grew by an average of 2-3% a year. This is 
respectable, but history suggests that it could do 
much better. As Chart 4 shows, at Morocco's 
current level of income (6% of US GDP), the best 
performing EMs managed to record real GDP per 
capita growth of 5% a year. 
Morocco also has a rapidly-growing population. 
Based on projections by the UN, the country's 
working-age population is on course to expand by 
around 0.8% per annum over the next fifteen 
years. (See Chart 5.)

Putting together possible rises in output per 
worker and in the labour force, Morocco's 
economy appears to have the potential to achieve 
annual GDP growth of as much as 5-6% a year. 
Of course, even if Morocco has a fast potential 
growth rate it doesn't necessarily mean the 
economy will grow this quickly. Indeed, it failed to 
do so by a significant margin over the past four 
years. However, as we explain in the rest of this 
Focus, we think there have been promising 
developments in Morocco which make the 
economy more likely to achieve its potential over 
the coming years. 
2. Improving macroeconomic stability 
This brings us to our second reason to expect 
strong growth, which is that the country's 
macroeconomic vulnerabilities have diminished. 
Notably, the government has made significant 
progress in reducing energy subsidies, most of 
which have now been eliminated. According to 
the IMF, overall subsidy spending is likely to fall to 
less than 2.0% of GDP by 2017, from 6.6% in 
2012. This should help to rein in the budget deficit 
- we expect it fall to under 4.0% of GDP by next 
year, from a peak of 7.4% in 2012. (See Chart 6.) 
As the fiscal deficit narrows, Morocco's public 
debt ratio - which rose from 47% of GDP in 2008 
to 65% last year - is likely to stabilise.

Admittedly, the falls in global food and energy 
prices over the past year mean that the subsidy bill 
would have fallen in any case. But the key point is 
that, by reducing subsidies, the fiscal position 
won't worsen again if commodity prices spike up 
in the future. 
On top of this, a new budget law, currently 
making its way through parliament, should help to 
strengthen fiscal discipline over the medium-term. 
A key pillar of this will be the establishment of a
