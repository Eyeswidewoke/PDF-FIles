Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements 
This prospectus contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to. among other things, future 
events and our business, financial condition and results of operations. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases 
such as "may," "should: "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "will likely result." "expect." "continue," "will," "anticipate," "seek," "estimate." "intend," "plan," 
"projection: "would" and "outlook," or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-
looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and 
certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that 
any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to 
predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove 
to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
