with my own recordings ;) .... Do you have a sound file of your experiment? I'd be curious to hear... 
Interestingly, the "plumbing" work we've been doing to connect OpenCog to the Hanson robots would also enable us to 
use OpenCog for music composition / improvisation experimentation ... (i.e. we've been dealing with real-time input and 
output, which we hadn't been doing 
before) 
But at the moment (this opinion is of course subject to revision) I somewhat feel that the basic problem of "what makes 
a melody /harmony / rhythm pattern sound emotionally and cognitively appealing" has to be solved before one moves 
on to issues of symphonic structure.... 
I.e., we probably gotta solve folk music before we can solve Beethoven or Bartok ... 
Meyer's old theory of "surprising fulfillment of expectations" 
http://rhythmcoglab.coursepress.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/10/Emotion-and-Meaning-in-Music.pdf 
is basically correct IMO (if you don't know that book check it out, you'll love his classical music examples) ... but the 
subtle point is that the expectations and the surprise we experience are a subtle mix of 
-- basic mathematical music-structure factors, as in the vein of the two papers I linked above 
-- human psychology factors as modeled e.g. in Joscha's work and in the Component Process Model ( 
http://boccignone.di.unimi.it/CompAff2015_files/Phil.%20Trans.%20R.%20Soc.%208-2009-Scherer-3459-74.pdf) 
which we have introduced into the OpenCog / Hanson Robot codebase to fill in certain gaps in Psi 
-- human body-rhythm patterns, to do with the way the rhythms of different subsystems of our physical bodies overlay 
on each other, which we perceive all the time sub and semi consciously and which influence our perception of music; 
obviously even classical music without a drumbeat is highly rhythmic... 
-- more abstract cognitive pattern recognition 
So a good melody packs up "surprising fulfillment of expectations" 
where the expectation and fulfillment are assessed according to a combination of the above 4 factors ... and if you leave 
any of the above 4 factors out you're going to get lots of "false positives" ... 
All of the above factors are there in Chinese, African etc. music as well as Western music, but manifested in different 
ways... 
I can pretty clearly see how to seriously investigate the above but I can't at the moment see a "quick and dirty" way to 
make huge progress quickly ... while seemingly simple, the question of "what makes a melody appealing" actually wraps 
up a lot of issues ... BODY, EMOTION, COGNITION ... plus MATH-OF-MUSIC ... 
Fascinating stuff though ;) 
If you want to design a research programme in this direction I'd be game to participate; I don't want to drop my other 
OpenCog R&D obviously but music just fascinates me at a heart as well as head level, so I'd be willing to put some time 
into this in parallel with making the Hanson robots work... I do have a feeling that to really crack the problem of what 
makes a melody sound good, one has to crack the problem of how feeling and body and cognition work together, which 
is a key problem for AGI generally speaking...
