There is not enough money for Phil to care about and he advised to take this great deal and move on. 
He told me to think about it and call him next week. 
I think he is a dick and he did nothing for me. All of the sudden he tells me that even though my mother invaded 
my father's trust, I have NO proof that she used that money to give to Gary. This is NEW. 
I only gave Phil 25 years of her bank/financial papers and every check she wrote to my brother that he never 
looked at. And Phil was given 25 years of financial correspondence as well. Helen Keller could have seen this paper trail. 
If she took money and wrote checks to Gary....and had no other income....and was busy selling off her big 
jewelry in Dixie Hyway in Palm Beach during the last 8 years of her life....what is Phil talking about. An idiot could figure 
out she used my father's money to give to my brother. 
Phil also said my mother had other assets she could have used to pay Gary. It was like he was working for Gary. 
It was insulting. 
What do you think? 
I made over a million dollars in last 3 months. Bigger problem is Bryan still takes 20% and I pay ALL the expenses 
on 80%. He does NOT bring in business. He does Not facilitate business. He still insists on collecting the money. I am now 
getting into this and developing a relationship with the studio people who pay the invoices. My accountant Josh now 
gets a copy of payments as soon and money comes into Bryan. 
Bryan has presented us with a ridiculous agreement to sign and if I don't sign it he will keep the domain if my 
name on my email 
when he suggested he manage my company 8 years ago, he registered my name as his domain 
without telling he did this. He essentially stole my name. 
We are now Chan: in: the domain that I will own...and settin: u • a whole new email s stem 
.and the Web 
Sight too. 
So that bargaining chip Bryan holds will not exist...and he will not have access to any emails. 
We are continuing to do business with him without a contract. I am going to find someone else to negotiate my 
fees for a 10% fee instead of 20% and Josh's team will take over billing and collecting. 
It makes my skin crawl that Bryan continues to beg the studios for his own screenings to nobodys but he sells it 
on inviting academy people....which is a complete conflict of interest. That is what the studios come to me for as he also 
takes a large piece of my fee for competing with me. When I asked him not to invite academy members from sept.-jan 
he got hysterical. 
I currently have a very nice calm working relationship with him...although he gets testy when asked to change a 
plane reservation. Josh says I need a travel agent. 
He whined about firing someone today...saying it was not his job. Trying to figure out what it his job....and to 
prove his weirdness...he never laid eyes on Jenna Friedman in the one year she worked there... this is a real sickness....to 
"run" a company from his apartment and never ever come to one event or look any employee in the eye.
