and has worked with G.V.F. as a wild-
life technician since 2004. He serves 
as the site coordinator for field sam-
pling and hunter-education programs. 
The hunters had gathered early, set-
tling into couches and armchairs that 
they had dragged to the village square. 
Diffo, a husky man in blue work pants 
and a red checkered shirt, passed around 
a sheaf of photographs. The group sud-
denly became quiet. 
"Do you see that boy?" Diffo asked, 
pointing to a recent picture of a local 
child whose face and body were covered 
with the type of blistering lesions that 
for centuries were the hallmark of 
smallpox. "Why do you think he looks 
like that?" Nobody answerixl—but any 
of them could have. "His father found 
dead monkeys lying in the forest: Diffo 
continued, speaking in French. "He 
brought them home to feed his family." 
At least one of those animals had been 
infected with monkeypox, which, while 
milder and less contagious than small-
pox, can be deadly. "If you see a group 
of animals lying in the forest, do not 
pick them up," Diffo said. "Whatever 
killed them can kill you." It is a message 
that Diffo repeats constantly as he 
passes through the villages of Central 
Africa. He comes anned with gruesome 
pictures of dead primates, posters ex-
plaining the health dangers posed by 
hunting bushmeat, and bars of soap for 
people to use after killing or butchering 
their prey. 
The audience was receptive; the re-
pulsive pictures seemed to have an im-
pact. Everyone collected a large bar of 
soap, and none of the questions the 
hunters asked were hostile, exactly. 
"What can you get us to replace this 
meat?" one of them asked. Killing pri-
mates may be dangerous for society 
and ecologically ruinous, but his chil-
dren still needed to eat. "We don't have 
anything else to give them: he said. 
Diffo cast a worried glance at Wolfe, 
who was watching from the side. "We 
know that," Wolfe said. "And we're 
working on it. But there is no easy 
way out." 
N
athan Wolfe's first obsession was 
with chimpanzees. "I always 
loved them," he told me one evening, 
while we sat on the veranda of our 
hotel in Yaounde, where his Cameroo-
THE BLUE HAMMOCK 
Behind the toolshed, among the nettles, 
and rusting horseshoes, I buried the key. 
The white dog watched me, whimpering, 
as if he disapproved of what I was doing 
but when I unearthed a bone and threw it 
he bounded away, barking, into the field. 
I replaced the spade in the shed, strode off 
to the blue hammock, and climbed into it. 
Swaying from side to side, I began to hum 
the tune from the first spaghetti Western, 
where Clint raises his poncho and shoots, 
then lights up another cigarillo. Above me 
the silver birch with my initials stretched 
upward to its far-off father, the moon. 
They would never, ever find that key, and 
in the morning I would head for Lisbon, 
where I'd rent a room in hilly Alfarna, 
then translate the entire work of Brecht. 
The seagulls are huge there, and musical. 
The crows spend most time on the ground. 
nian operations are based. "I spent 
years thinking about nonhuman pri-
mates, and there came a moment, in 
college, when I realized that, no mat-
ter how often we claim otherwise, hu-
mans are not the center of the world. 
We are players in a much bigger and 
more compelling drama. A lot of my 
work is just an attempt to figure out 
what that drama looks like and where, 
exactly, we do fit in." 
In the early nineteen-nineties, 
while studying as an undergraduate 
at Stanford, Wolfe became interested 
in the self-medicating behavior of an-
imals, and the fact that, as he later 
wrote, "not all pharmacists are hu-
man." Many species use plants as 
medicine in much the same way that 
we do. Kodiak bears routinely chew 
the root of Ligustiaem, an herb more 
commonly known as bear root. They 
—Matthew Sweeney 
spit the juice onto their paws and mas-
sage it into their fur; researchers sus-
pect it acts as an antibacterial agent. 
Birds also use plants as drugs, and they 
even appear to treat themselves with 
ants, in a procedure known as "anting," 
rubbing them vigorously through their 
plumage, until the ants secrete pro-
tective chemicals. (VVolfe's interest 
in self-medicating behavior is not 
wholly dispassionate. About a year 
ago, he switched from cigarettes to the 
Ploom—a high-tech nicotine-delivery 
system. To "ploom," one drops an alu-
minum pod of tobacco into the cham-
ber of a Plexiglas cigarette holder that 
looks like it was designed for George 
Jetson. The Ploom delivers a mea-
sured, vaporized dose of nicotine, 
without tar or other cancer-causing 
chemicals. Wolfe loves to light up in 
restaurants and theatres, and since no
