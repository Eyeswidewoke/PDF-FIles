your client,=Lawrence Krauss, copied me on his February 23rd4=A0email communication to the Office 
of Equity and Inclusion. I am writing to=20 convey the University's position on its responsibility to conduct=20 
administrative investigations into allegations of conduct that would violate institutional policy, if true. Because Dr. 
Krauss has retained legal counsel, I am writing directly to you. You may forward m= communication on to your client. 
Without having first secured your permission, I did not think it was proper for me to copying him =n this reply. 
Our policy=on the Prohibition Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation (AC= 401

procedures (P20 — link to the procedures is=20 embedded in the policy document) directs the Office of Equity and 
Inclusion to conduct prompt and equitable investigations. Among the=20 points stated are that the Office accepts 
anonymous compla=nts as well as direct complaints. University employees are required to cooperate=20 with any 
investigation or allegations of violations of this policy. =20 Providing false or misleading information or failing to 
cooperate may result in disciplinary action. Individuals making a complaint or participating as a witness in an 
investigation cannot be retaliated against. Any employee who engages in retaliation will be disciplined.=C20 The Office 
of Equity and Inclusion does not make any findings until such time as it determines that it has completed its fact 
gathering. 
</=iv> 
Our courts recognize that <=ont size="6">participants in an administrative investigation have a priv=lege 
against a defamation charge. In Paro= v. Hoemako Hospital, 140 Ariz. 335, 681 P.2d 918 (Ct. App. Div. 2 1984), the court 
recognized that the employer's response to a notice of charge of discriminatio= filed with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission was absolutely privileged. In Miller v. Servicemaster by R=es, 174 Ariz. at 520, 851 P.2d 240, 
243 (Ct. App. Div. 1 1993), the court recognized the existence of a conditional privilege for employees to report 
perceived acts of sexual harassment as public policy dictated that employees must be protected from workplace sexual 
harassment. Cited approvingly, Carey v. Maricopa County, 2009 WL 750225 (D. Ariz. 2009). Both.=A0Paros and were 
cases concerning discrimination and harassment under Title VII. In=20 addition to its obligations under Title VII, the 
University must also operate its educational programs and activities to be free from gender discrimination under Title IX. 
The Office of Equity and Inclusion will proceed with its investigation as outlined in ACD 401 and P20. The 
Office will not provide y=ur client with its investigative file. We look forward to Dr. Krauss0=800s continuing 
cooperation. Regards,

Dear Naimah et al: 
Attached you will find a letter from my attorney, along with a letter he sent to Buzzfeed earlier in this 
week regarding the defamatory and false story they were planning on printing. The story was then published yesterda= 
morning. I wanted to add to his letter, to reiterate our concern about how your office was planning to follow up on the 
false and defamatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because this was initiated by an on=ine entertainment 
news outlet with a clear agenda and established record of propagating false allegations about me, rather than by any of 
the individuals they refer to as sources, this should not be considered a=20 credible allegation worthy of investigation. I 
believe that our initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. Whether or not =ou agree with this, there are two 
things I think =re important to establish. 
</=iv> 
Firstly,=C2Othat the University should not propagate what can be false allegations from such a source 
by presenting them directly to current and/or former employees or to others. To do so would be to further their 
libelous=20 agenda, as Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard, I would appreciate seeing copies of the 
correspondence you might send to current or former employees about this in the process of carrying out and concluding 
your investigation.
