said, "President Obama has betrayed Israel." A statement by the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Simon+Wiesenthal+Center> referred to the 1967 lines as "the 'Auschwitz 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Auschwitz-Birkenau>' borders." Unnamed Israelis in Netanyahu's entourage said 
Obama just doesn't understand Israel and its situation. 
A nasty U.S.-Israeli spat has erupted. It was laid bare in the unusually blunt remarks made by Netanyahu after meeting 
Obama on Friday, and is certain to impact both the President's speech today to the Americanlsrael Public Affairs 
Committee chttp://www.nydailynews.com/topics/AmericanIsrael+Public+Affairs+Committee> and Netanyahu's address 
to Congress tomorrow. 
What are we to make of the heated rhetoric in the wake of Obama's remarks? Is this about reality, politics or a little bit 
of both? Was Obama's statement a major break from previous U.S. policy or rather an incremental step forward? 
First, a brief primer on a very complicated subject. Before 1967, the dividing line between Israel and the West Bank 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/West+Bank> was the Armistice Line, negotiated between Israel and Jordan 
chttp://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Kingdom+of+Jordan> in 1949. Subsequently, Jordan annexed the West Bank but 
renounced its claim to this territory in 1988. 
Israel occupied this territory in the 1967 war. Since the Madrid peace conference 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Madrid+Conference> in 1991, Israel and the Palestinians have been negotiating 
the details of the transfer of these territories to the Palestinians. The expectation has been that the Palestinians would 
set up an independent state, and Israeli security requirements would be addressed. 
Meantime, over the course of the last few generations, Israel has built settlements in the West Bank. (Israeli settlements 
in the Gaza Strip <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Gaza+Strip> , taken from Egyptian control in 1967, were 
evacuated unilaterally by Israel in 2005.) About 500,000 Israeli settlers live in settlements in the West Bank and in 
neighborhoods of Jerusalem <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Jerusalem> considered by the international 
community to be settlements, although Israel considers those neighborhoods to be part of a sovereign united 
Jerusalem. About 80% of the Israeli settlers reside on about 5% of all settled land. 
What will happen to those settlements, some of which sit on land that Israel believes to be vital to its capacity to defend 
itself, is one of the core issues in the peace negotiations. Israel insists upon retaining settlements in major blocs around 
Jerusalem and near the former Armistice lines. The Palestinians insist on regaining 100% of the West Bank or its 
equivalent. 
Thus, we arrive at "swaps." 
Words matter in diplomacy, and the President did use a new formulation to describe American policy regarding the 
location of the border: "The borders of Israel and Palestine," the President said, "should be based on the 1967 lines with 
mutually agreeable swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states." 
But Obama's words must be seen against the backdrop of formulations used by his two predecessors, Bill Clinton 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Bill+Clinton> and George W. Bush 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/George+W.+Bush> . 
In parameters for negotiations laid out in early 2001, Clinton spoke about land swaps to bridge Israeli desires to keep 
areas heavily settled since 1967 and Palestinian desires to get all the territories occupied in the 1967 war. Clinton 
suggested percentages of land that would be involved in the swaps. 
Four years later, Bush sent a letter to then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Ariel+Sharon> that approached the issue from a different angle, but with the 
same effect. Bush said the U.S. understands it is not realistic to expect Israel to withdraw "already existing major Israeli
