and to distribute to you (or pay on =our behalf) additional monies as reasonably needed to the extent 
that your income from other sources is not =ufficient to support your reasonable expenses. 
Notwithstanding your statement that =E2404>As for the claim about concern for my later years, that has 
been =horoughly refuted" it =as not been refuted in the context of my trusteeship and it remains my =uty to consider 
distributions in light of the possibility that you will have a reasonable need for distributions from the trust for many 
more =ears, and perhaps in increasing amounts, depending on your =ircumstances in the future.

I didn't respond before but perhaps I should =ave. I will be 90 years old in a few months. I'm not going 
=o live forever. You know how much is in the Trust. You also =now my spending habits. Harry would not have millions 
of dollars =f I hadn't been working all my life and saving money for him and his =isters. Despite the ugly implications 
about Valeria in Harry's =etter, nothing material changed after our marriage beyond what I =escribed and can readily 
document, with one exception. In =exington, I was living rent-free, the mortgage having been paid years =arlier. Valeria 
and I decided that taking care of a big house with =teps everywhere and everything else that owning a house in 
Lexington =ntails -- snow removal, etc., and a difficult drive to work through New =ngland winter weather -- made no 
sense at my age, and that we =hould move to an apartment close to work with no steps or other =roblems. 
=/div> 
Not your business, but one thing that shocked =e about Harry's letter was his complaint that I 
moved from a house to a =new home" -- insinuation obvious -- in fact an apartment with no winter =riving to my office 
and convenient for someone my age.

S. 
As for the specifics of disclosure, =hat I need to consider is (a) what your income was in 
2017, since that =as the basis for the tax payments you seek to have reimbursed, (b) what your income is likely to be this 
year and going forward, (c) =hat your expenses were in 2017 and are likely to be in 2018, and (d) =hether any of your 
income (or other resources) are being used for =urposes that the trust cannot support (such as gifts to third parties). So 
far, Rich has provided me with some =ough information about your 2017 expenses. There are some gaps in =hat 
information, but nothing that can't be cleared up pretty =asily (I think). Rich has also assured me that you have not 
made any gifts that have diminished your resources and I assume you would =onfirm that to me. What I don't have at 
this point is enough information =bout your income, so that I can consider what the gap is between your =xpenses and 
your income, which is the gap the trusts might help to =lose up. With respect to your income in 2017, all I can see is that 
your income tax obligations seem to be much higher than they were =reviously. I'm assuming that reflects a jump in 
income =rom (i) the profit made on the sale of the condominium, and (ii) large =ithdrawals from your IRA. If you want to 
provide me with more information (bearing in mind what I noted in item #3, above) then =nformation about your 2017 
income and what your income is likely to be =his year is what I most need. 
There is a very simple reason for the =ncome tax obligations. The depletion of the IRA that I 
reviewed =gain above imposed a huge tax burden, which we were still attempting to deal with in 2017. After Harry's 
refusal to release some funds =rom the trust to pay the exorbitant taxes resulting from what was =appening, I of course 
had to withdraw funds from the IRA to pay taxes =n the whole estate, incurring a new exorbitant tax burden. Despite
