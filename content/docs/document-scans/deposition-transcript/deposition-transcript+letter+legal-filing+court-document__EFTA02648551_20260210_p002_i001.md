me to serve, I=E2nm looking forward to resigning as soon as the court determines how I am to do so and how my 
successor is to be selected.</=:p> 
3. = 
Given that my r=placement is impending, it might be worth waiting until my successor is in p=ace before 
responding to my requests for financial disclosure, as it's possible that my successor won't share my views as t= what 
the trustee of the trusts needs to know before making decisions about=distributions. Likewise, if my successor will be 
identified soon it m=ght make sense for me to hold off on any distributions and leave it to the new trustee to work with 
you on figuring all of this ou=. In this regard I'm kind of a "lame duck" tr=stee, wouldn't you say? 
4. = 
To the extent t=at you want to push forward while I remain the trustee, let me again state t=e basis for 
financial disclosure by you. It is that, as trustee, I owe a duty to you and I owe a duty to your children (as the r=mainder 
beneficiaries of the trusts). For the present my primary duty=is to you and it is to distribute to you all income earned by 
the trusts, n=t of expenses, and to distribute to you (or pay on your behalf) additional monies as reasonably needed 
to=the extent that your income from other sources is not sufficient to support=your reasonable expenses. 
Notwithstanding your statement that "As for the claim about concern for my later years, th=t has been thoroughly 
refuted" it has not been refuted in the context of my trusteeship and it remains my d=ty to consider distributions in light 
of the possibility that you will have=a reasonable need for distributions from the trust for many more years, 
and=perhaps in increasing amounts, depending on your circumstances in the future. 
5. = 
As for the spec=fics of disclosure, what I need to consider is (a) what your income was in 2=17, since that 
was the basis for the tax payments you seek to have reimbursed, (b) what your income is likely to be this year and=going 
forward, (c) what your expenses were in 2017 and are likely to be in 2=18, and (d) whether any of your income (or other 
resources) are being used f=r purposes that the trust cannot support (such as gifts to third parties). So far, Rich has 
pro=ided me with some rough information about your 2017 expenses. There a=e some gaps in that information, but 
nothing that can't be cleared u= pretty easily (I think). Rich has also assured me that you have not made any gifts that 
have diminished your resources and=l assume you would confirm that to me. What I don't have at this point is enough 
information about your inc=me, so that I can consider what the gap is between your expenses and your i=come, which is 
the gap the trusts might help to close up. With respec= to your income in 2017, all I can see is that your income tax 
obligations seem to be much higher than they were prev=ously. I'm assuming that reflects a jump in income from (i) t=e 
profit made on the sale of the condominium, and (ii) large withdrawals fr=m your IRA. If you want to provide me with 
more information (bearing in mind what I noted in item #3, above) then info=mation about your 2017 income and what 
your income is likely to be this yea= is what I most need. 
I hope this is helpful and w=ll wait to hear more from you and/or Rich.
