People are chopping themselves up in cable but the shorts who played the big break sub 1.3240 are still in the money 
and seem to be hiding out in eurstg longs. We favour being long the cross as we seem to be putting higher lows and use 
the 100 DMA as a pivot. We can still see stg squeezing a little higher and favour selling up to 1.3340. There really isn't 
much due out of brexit until the EU summit on the 19th of October so actively trade the cross from the long side. 
Barnier's comments on Brexit deadlock on financial settlements adding some weight this morning but 1.30 handle has 
been resilient recently — buys on dips are advised at these levels. 
JPY (Mark Salib) 
USDJPY 
Support: 111.99 (10/10 Low), 111.84 (200DMA) 
Resistance: 113.44 (6/10 high) 
EURJPY 
Support: 131.75 (26/09 low),131.09 (SSDMA) 
Resistance: 134.40 (22/09 
high) 
EURJPY the show stopper in the JPY complex as in line with broad EUR strength, the cross finally breaking to the topside 
on what was seemingly a subdued range. the FED minutes as Dovish as they may have been perceived didn't help weigh 
down the USD leg too much with the focus now on the crosses with value seemingly in the EUR cross and a hint of 
caution taken by some going into CPIs tomorrow — until then, we respect the ranges in USDJPY with current skew 
holding to the downside but big moving averages below should hold until tomorrow. 
AUD, NZD (Greg Fiori) 
AUDUSD: 
Support: .7780 then .7733 (last week's 
low) 
Resistance: .7850 
NZDUSD: 
Support: 
.7052 (this week's 
low) 
Resistance: .7159 (200 dma) 
AUD-NZD- Aud and Nzd continue in recovery phrases off last week's lows with better performances against 
Eur noted o/n. Both pairs helping to be underpinned by a risk favorable environment and further gains may be 
seen. Bias remains for lower price in both and will look to add to shorts risking price action above .7850 and 
.7160. Upcoming risk events include RBA Financial Stability review this evening and coalition decision by NZ 
First (now pushed back a few days till w/end-early next week).

Resistance: 1.2663 (Aug 31 
USDCAD has spent some time below 1.2500 the last two days, but has remained resilient above it. To me, this is shaping 
up as a transition week where the market will spend its time searching for the next major theme to grip ahold of. Over a 
more multi week horizon, I continue to like a weaker CAD as the market continues to adjust curve pricing to a more 
dovish BOC. However, for the time being, CAD is a slave to the general USD trend (or lack thereof). So what does that 
mean?....range trading! Broadly speaking, I'll abide by the 1.2500-1.2600 range of the last three trading sessions until 
an impetus to alter that plan arises. On the economic front, we have Canadian housing starts and building permit data 
this morning.
