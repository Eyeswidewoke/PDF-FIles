greater of: (1) the sum (rounded to the nearest dollar) of 1% of your New Balance plus the interest and fees we charged as shown on the bill and any past due 
amounts: or (2) $15. However, if your New Balance exceeds your Credit Limit. then at our option, we may require you to pay any amount up to the entire 
overlimit amount instead of the Minimum Payment Due. In no event will your Minimum Payment Due exceed the amount of your New Balance. We may adjust 
your Minimum Payment Due in accordance with our PayAhead Program.
