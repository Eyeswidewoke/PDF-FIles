Naturally, I want make sure that when I die, Valeria will at least hav= a place to live and something to live on. 
DPQ: I might re-word this=as it is Noam's intent as expressed to me and Gene that Valeria re=eives the totality of 
Noam's estate, and not just an amount that w=ll give her subsistence. 
VC: Again, Deborah. This i= the main and extremely important point of my letter. I might be ent=tled to receive 
whatever will be left from one of the IRA, if something wi=l be left, but not the "totality" of Noam's estate.</=> 
She came here, abandoning everything in Brazil, to be with me in my =ast years. We are very happy together, 
and care for each other. =AO It is a joy I never anticipated after Mommy died and after the years I =pent alone. 
That's the situation. It is entirely different from what you=heard. Again, I do not know what the source of your 
information is, =ut it is completely inaccurate. 
I should add, perhaps, that in earlier years, I was indeed careless ab=ut expenses, leaving it to Mommy. Valeria 
has taken over, and for th= past three years, both of us have been monitoring expenses carefully and know exactly what 
is coming in and what =s being spent. We have all the facts very clearly laid out, and are =lanning accordingly. I am glad 
that the three of you will be well ta=en care of from the estate, the way it was planned years ago. DPQ: =s above the 
reference here should be to Carol's Marital Trusts, ju=t to be clear that the that is the children's inheritance.<=pan 
style="color:black"> 
VC: I disagree, Debora.. The reference here should be to what corresponds to reality -- =A0Noam's children will 
be taken care from his estate. Not only fr=m Carol's Marital Trust that were composed by Noam as the grantor= 
established to make use of the guarantees for the children and tax issues= but still part of Noam's estate, as we all know. 
Frankly, I always assumed that I would be able to disregard financial =oncerns in my last years, but as a result of 
careless and faulty decisions=taken long ago, and some bad recent advice, that is not the way things are turning out.

Dear Doddoy and Valeria, 
It was really nice to talk to both of you just now - we'll have to =o it more often. 
As I mentioned, I'm sending you a letter from all three of us (Avi =nd Harry in copy). 
We decided to write this letter because we are very worried about what =e've been hearing from you about 
your financial situation and the =mount of stress it is causing you. We have been worried for many months now, but the 
situation seems to be be=oming more and more dire and we feel like we can't just stand by a=d watch it happen any 
more. We want to help find solutions that might be l=ss drastic than what we understand you are considering.
