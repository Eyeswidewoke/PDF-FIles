Harvard =80 s highly unusual decision to slash tuition for the next year follows =he great success of Poetry in America's

Sincerely, 
Lisa 
P.S. and thank you so much, Jeff=ey, for your amazing support , without which much of what I've managed=in the last 
few years would never have happened. My next course for =eachers,  as you'll notice, has shifted from art to 
environment--not =ecause of any less passion on my part for arts content but really be=ause of greater enthusiasm 
among others for poetry/science for the classro=m. I would like to hear more from you about what you think 
kids/schools ne=d in this area. Larry tells me you have views; as I move out of my central=areas, I will need advice

skills, as they craft medi=, curriculum, and digital architecture for this second Poetry in America c=urse for teachers.

Literature Initiative of Harvard Medical School, an= the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning at Harvard, Poetry in

of health. Content developed fo= this project has the potential to become a television episode.
