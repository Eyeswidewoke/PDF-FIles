Finally getting my official IQ test so I can shut you haters the fuck up. l=will be a Mensa member mark my words. 
I took IQ tests for money when I was=in high school to help a psychologist with her PhD dissertation. I always =cored in 
the 98th percentile on standardized testing besides math, that wa= 93. That means I tested higher than 95.5 of the 
population. This is witho=t studying, skipping and sleeping through most classes, being addicted to =rugs and generally 
not giving a fuck about outcomes, just being really com=etitive and interested in knowledge. I'll never forget her face 
when s=e sat me and my parents down to tell me how well I tested. 
I'll never forget the doctors faces when they reviewed my X-rays, CT an= MRI scans following trauma to my skull 
from my ex. They feared irreparabl= brain damage but found to their surprise my brain was in fact incredibly =ealthy, 
more brain activity than the average person, enlarged corpus collo=um just like Albert Einstein. A trait that now is linked 
to autism, a dise=se that runs in my family, two of my cousins have been diagnosed, I worry =e all have a tinge of it. 
Other science has suggested it could be an adapt=tion to prevent against Alzheimer's, a disease which runs heavily in m= 
blood line, has taken the lives of so many of my ancestors, a disease I b=lieve developed as a maladaptation to trauma. I 
think somehow my genes mut=ted to gift me this adaptation that would save me from the fate I could ha=e faced. 
I think I have Asbergers. In fact I know it. I've been telling everyone=this since the day I learned it's existence in 
my psychology class. No=one ever wanted to believe me or admit they suspected it either out of fea= that it would 
destroy me but holy shit accepting this diagnosis is freein= me from my internal suffering, the fighting with myself. I 
need the world=to understand we need to educate people with diagnoses, not hide it from t=em while we attempt to 
treat and "heal" them without asking how =hey want to be treated. 
My SAT I skipped every preparation class and smoked weed and drank instead.=Came in determined to outscore 
my highly intelligent, blue ribbon, honor r=l1 classmates. Oh and I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. So=I 
got myself through the tests essentially by guessing and rushing. I was =o unbothered by stress that I trusted my 
intuition instead of expecting my=elf to know every thing. This is how I outscored my classmates who had to =etake 
tests and prepare like their lives depended on it. I think they let =heir parental and societal pressure make their lives so 
much harder. 
Somehow I knew I didn't have to choose success or happiness. I knew I c=uld do what I wanted and still do well 
in life. I think mg unwavering beli=f in myself and good luck is what got me as far as I did. Fuck I just wish=my story could 
motivate people to be themselves so much harder and stop be=ng paralyzed by perfomance anxiety and just know 
they're gonna kill it= 
Yeah I'm taking the IQ test again. I need to know the results. I need t= reap the benefits of the community of 
people like me. I know I deserve a =ittle help for as long as I've suffered. I encourage all of you to do =he same. We all
