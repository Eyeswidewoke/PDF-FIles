Last year, in an effort to keep their jobs, workers in Sardinia barricaded themselves in front of a mine packed with 
almost 700 kilograms of explosives. One miner told the cameras, "We cannot take i= anymore. We cannot. We cannot ... 
Is this what we have to do?" And=slit his wrist on live TV. 
Mattana told Pope Francis how unemployment, "oppresses you and wears you out to the depths of your soul." 
"Where there's no work, there's no dignity." The consequence, the Pope said, of a system that has at its center an idol 
call=d money. 
At that moment, Pope Francis was not just the head of the Catholic Church. Rather, he embodied the heart of a catholic 
cry for jus=ice, small "c" catholic, a universal aspiration expressed in our coun=ry by the promise that life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness is the birthright =f every citizen. 
The richest 400 Americans are now worth a combined $2 trillion, while new figures from the Census Bureau show that 
the typical mi=dle class family makes less, less than it did in 1989, with roughly 46 million people living at or below the 
poverty line. With the exception of Romani=, no developed country has a higher percentage of kids in poverty than we 
do. =A0Yet the House of Representatives has just cut food stamps for people who don'= have enough money to feed 
themselves. 
So Pope Francis and Kumi Naidoo speak the truth, in different accents and with different metaphors, but their message 
boils dow= to this, capitalism is like fire, a good servant but a bad master. If we do='t dethrone our present system of 
financial capitalism that rewards those at t=e top who then use it to rig the rules against even the most reasonable 
check=on their excesses, It will consume us. And that fragile, thin line between democracy and a darker social order will 
be extinguished. 
Watch Jon Stewart's Shutdown Tirade 
"Did you see the Giants game =n Sunday?" he said. "They lost 31=7. Do you know what the Giants didn't say after that 
game? 'If you don't give us 25 more points by midnight on Monday, we will shut down the fucking NFL.'=94

Brilliant — Jon=Stewart on the government shutdown 
We have to ask/wonder why Republican-controlled states are doing everything they can to thwart 
implementation of the Afford=ble Care Act, AKA Obamacare especially when many of these are Southern states w=th a 
large number of poor and minority residents. The New York Times has noted that many residents of red states are 
getting royally screwed because their elected officials refuse to participate. Two-thirds of poor blacks and s=ngle 
mothers and more than half of low-wage workers who don't have insurance are being left in the cold= Scott Maxwell in 
the Orlando Sentinel has it right about the shameful behavior of Republican Florida legislators who are rejecting $51 
billion in federal dollars that would help the needy in their state. Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford said he was
