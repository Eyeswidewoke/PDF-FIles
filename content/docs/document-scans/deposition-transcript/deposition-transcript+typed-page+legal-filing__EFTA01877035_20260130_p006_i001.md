regulate and the public have no real appetite or patience for reassurances that a 
renewed rigour from supervisors will fix the problem. The proxies for culture are going 
to be pay and senior accountability, and these are the two things that ultimately 
tripped up Mr Diamond at Barclays. Although many in banking would like to argue 
that these things are beside the point, politically they are the point. 
Like much else in the current banking model, the case for remuneration levels in 
banking is based purely on the logic and discipline of the free market for financial 
services. Yet the bailouts of 2008 and the LIBOR-fixing scandal have further exhausted 
political and regulatory patience with the idea that banking exists in a free market. 
High levels of remuneration are also glaringly at odds with the wider economic context 
and the prevailing political climate. George Osborne, the British Chancellor, has tried 
to accommodate London-based investment banks by resisting the rather rigid rules 
inserted at the last minute by the European Parliament into the European CRD4 
Directive applying ratios for fixed and bonus pay at European banks. But in doing so he 
is well aware that he is badly out of step with the public mood. 
The accountability problem is as simple and blunt as politics gets. The massive market 
disruptions of 2008 and the ensuing economic crisis have created a latent political 
desire for personal accountability from the banking industry that it has so far been 
unable to meet. In part this is because the most egregiously managed institutions in 
the period leading up to 2008 have simply disappeared. The survivors are generally 
not inclined to feel implicated in the industry's wider collective problems. Mr Diamond 
always seemed to hint at the indignation of an executive whose bank had survived the 
banking crisis without direct government support and who felt he had little to answer 
for, at least until his employees' malpractice made this untenable. This is part of what 
made him such a lightning rod and figure of resentment for many politicians. 
The political fallout 
How will this play out politically? The UK's Labour opposition has clearly judged that 
there is mileage in a renewed campaign against the bankers. However, although 
Labour supports a tightening of the government's proposed rules on derivatives inside 
the ringfence for British retail banks proposed for 2013, its ultimate aim is not a 
particular regulatory outcome but something closer to a moral posture on capitalism. 
Labour leader Ed Miliband has broadly disowned the banking record of the Labour 
government before 2010 and has put a "better, improved capitalism" at the heart of 
his election platform. This is achieving some resonance in the media. His aim is to use 
a moral and ethical critique of banking as a way of differentiating himself and the 
Labour party both from its own past and the Conservative-led Coalition government. 
The Coalition government inevitably will be forced to cover the same ground. 
The Conservative party is much less inclined to make a moral issue of banking, still less 
of capitalism more widely. However, most of the very small number of genuinely 
forensic critics of the banking sector in the UK Parliament are Tories, and often 
individuals with financial services backgrounds. The Chancellor George Osborne 
currently seems more inclined to use the LIBOR issue as an opportunity to attack 
Labour's record in government, but if other banks are fined and the Parliamentary 
enquiry is highly critical, then he will have to tack to stay close enough to the public 
mood. His own backbenchers have already started to grumble that he has misjudged 
the LIBOR scandal by playing it for politics rather than a question of principle and 
policy.
