Re: Research 
Wow. That is incredibly generous of you!!! We cannot thank you enough. We =ill keep you apprised if progress in the 
project. I truly believe that you= contribution will be looked upon someday as enabling major progress in ca=cer 
pathogenesis. 
I will get you the details shortly.

Our research is based on the hypothesis that it is the micro-environment (e=g., the "normal" breast tissue surrounding a 
breast cancer in the case of =reast cancer) that enables tumors to metastasize - rather than something i=trinsic to the 
tumors. There is much anecdotal evidence to support this an= it also explains several paradoxes about breast cancer -
for example, why=extirpative surgery for breast cancer seems to cause a paradoxical rise ca=cer activity. This theory 
which is known as the "seed and soil" hypothesis=has been purely theoretical in the past because until now there was 
never =ay to study the microenvironment around these tumors without killing the h=st or killing the tissue itself. 
We came up with the idea to use fluid that is routinely collected (but thro=n away) for 1-2 weeks after breast surgery as 
a proxy for the microenviron=ent around the tumor. Let me explain - after breast surgery to remove a c=ncerous breast, 
we routinely place a plastic drainage tube in the wound be= which exits the skin and drains excess blood and wound 
fluid into small p=astic reservoirs. This prevents buildup of unwanted blood and fluid after =urgery. This fluid is thrown 
away. The drains are kept in for a week or tw=. Our idea was that this fluid contains all the proteins, growth factors, 
=ytokines, DNA transcription factors etc that are secreted by the cells aro=nd a cancer and would make an ideal way of 
studying the microenvironment i= vivo. 
For the last three years, we have been collecting wound fluid for the first=48 hours after breast cancer surgery. We 
compare fluid in the same patient=from the cancerous breast to the non-cancerous breast and from the cancero=s 
breast to the abdomen. In certain surgeries the opposite non-cancerous b=east is removed as a precaution or tissue 
from the abdomen is used to reco=struct the removed breast which is why we have access this fluid from then= sites as 
well. This "normal" fluid is used as a control for the fluid fro= the cancerous breast. 
We have found differences in this fluid in both test tubes and in mice. Our=preliminary results are positive and show 
that this idea has validity. We =ant to continue to characterize this fluid from cancerous breasts and to c=llect more 
specimens. If we are successful, this will be a major advance i= understanding the mechanisms of cancer. 
I supported this work with my own personal research fund. 
I have spent $200,000 of my research fund (given to me patients) to pay for=a full time lab tech devoted to this project 
and for all of the supplies o=er the last three years. But my fund is down to $10,000. I have another do=ation of
