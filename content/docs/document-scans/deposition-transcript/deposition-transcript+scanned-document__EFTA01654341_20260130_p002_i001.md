that they can legally refuse to carry out unlawful orders. According to the article, the lawmakers, including Senator Mark Kelly and 
Representatives Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio, Chrissy Houlahan, and Senator Elissa Slotkin, claim the FBI move is an attempt by

personnel can refuse to follow illegal orders, which President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have described as "seditious" 
acts. "The President directing the FBI to target us is exactly why we made this video in the first place: U.S. Senator Sloddn of Michigan, a former 
CIA officer, said on X. "This is not the America I know, and I'm not going to let this next step from the FBI stop me from speaking up for my 
country, and our Constitution." The Associated Press (11/25, Cappelletti, Householder) added that the FBI declined to comment Tuesday, but 
Director Patel, in an interview with Journalist Catherine Herridge, described it as an "ongoing matter" in explaining why he could not discuss 
details. Asked for his reaction to the video, Director Patel said, "What goes through my head is the same thing that goes through my head in any 
case: is there a lawful predicate to open up an inquiry and investigation, or is there not? And that decision will be made by the career agents and 
analysts here at the FBI." Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (11/25, Barr, Siegel, Murray), Al Jazeera (11/25, Rasheed),
