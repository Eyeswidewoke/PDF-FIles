had to move ton=s of stuff alone from my house without knowing where to go and still=now sleeping on a coach 
without a room on my own ( my mother rented my roo= for a year in Rome so I don't even have a real home where to 
go ) Wor=ing 12h per day as a babysitter in order to earn some money because it'=s the only paying job I found without 
a degree after asking everyone I kne=. In addition trying to keep up with the photographer.. I promise I'm =rying my best 
to be strong and stay positive but managing all this alone a= 20 years old with no moral support and a broken heart is 
hard, specially =fter I've loved you so much with every part of myself and still do now=.. (I guess this is the reason you've 
pushed me away). Anyways I don&#=9;t want to whine but just let you know that even in this hard situation I=#39;m 
doing the best I can to grow and survive. I love you
