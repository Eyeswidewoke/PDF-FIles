(2) Reflects $ 
aggregate principal amount of debentures sold to retail investors, for which the underwriters 
received an underwriting discount of S 
per debenture, and $ 
aggregate principal amount of 
debentures sold to institutional investors, for which the underwriters received an underwriting discount of 
per debenture. 
(3) Assumes all retail sales for debentures issued in connection with the exercise of the overallotment option. 
We estimate that our total expenses relating to the offering, not including the underwriting discount, will be 
approximately $0.4 million. 
The debentures are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We will apply for the listing 
of the debentures on the NYSE under the symbol "WRB PR D." If approved for listing, we expect trading of the 
debentures on the NYSE to commence within 30 days after they arc first issued. We have been advised by the 
underwriters that the underwriters intend to make a market in the debentures but arc not obligated to do so and 
may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the 
trading market for the debentures. 
In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell debentures in the open market. 
These transactions may include short sales. stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by 
short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of debentures than they are 
required to purchase in the offering. The underwriters must close out any short position by purchasing debentures 
in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may 
be downward pressure on the price of the debentures in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect 
investors who purchase in this offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the 
purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the debentures while the offering is in 
progress. 
The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the 
underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased 
debentures sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. 
These activities by the underwriters, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts. 
may stabilize. maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the debentures. As a result, the price of the 
debentures may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are 
commenced, they may be discontinued by the underwriters at any time. These transactions may be effected in the 
over-the-counter market or otherwise. 
Some of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in. and may in the future engage in, investment 
banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have 
received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Morgan Stanley &
