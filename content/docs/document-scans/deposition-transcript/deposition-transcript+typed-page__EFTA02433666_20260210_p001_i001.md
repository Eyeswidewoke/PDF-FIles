Subject: Quit bashing Dubai! Quit bashing Dubai! By Lind Heard 
Linda Heard is a british specialist free lance writer and also contributes to on line 
Attacking Dubai has become fashionable in Western circles. 
British reporters and columnists, in particular, are sinking their teeth into the Emirate like dogs chomping on a juicy bone. 
The latest news that Dubai World seeks to restructure its debt involving a six-month payment delay has triggered a host of 
salivating media hounds baying for blood. A few days ago, hysterical headlines were predicting another global economic 
crash with banks worldwide falling like ninepins. Following the doom-laden onslaught, currencies have dipped and 
markets fallcn.Countries. companies and individuals restructure their debts all the time. There has been no suggestion that 
Dubai World is about to go under or that it will leave its creditors high and dry. The fact is Dubai is getting back on its 
feet. Its true that it was more vulnerable to the global economic downturn than the rest of the Middle East but the crisis 
itself was not of its own doing.Even the finest financial brains were unable to foresee the US subprime crisis that spurred 
the global meltdown. Yet, according to an article in the Sunday Times a few days ago titled Dubai needs to stop the 
contagion fast, Dubai is a monument to the excesses that gave us this global financial crisis. Theres just one problem with 
that. The crisis resulted from greedy US mortgage lenders, unscrupulous financial houses and dodgy credit ratings 
agencies.Just in case my colleagues in the British media are too busy dreaming up new slanderous tidbits for their next 
bash-Dubai installment to think objectively, its worthwhile stressing that the emirate docsnt stand alonelt is an integral 
part of the United Arab Emirates, which, overall is doing very nicely. Just a day before the Dubai World announcement. 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was impressed by the quick recovery made by the UAE economy and the 
measures made by the leadership...There is absolutely no way that the federal government in Abu Dhabi would throw 
Dubai to the wolves, for if it did, the whole country would be dragged down with it; perhaps even the region. To prove the 
point, the countrys Central Bank has moved to guarantee Dubais debts while more liquidity is being pumped into Dubai 
banks. Some pundits are peering into their crystal balls to prophecy a quid pro quo situation whereby Dubai will end up 
having to hand its airline Emirates or other major Dubai-owned companies to Abu Dhabi.That. too, is an unlikely scenario 
because the two emirates are linked by more than money. They have ties of blood and marriage as well as a shared history. 
Thirty-eight years ago. on Dec. 2. 1971. the UAE was founded. Cementing the seven emirates that make up the UAE was 
no easy task for its founders, but they did it against all odds. Western predictions that the fledgling country would collapse 
due to infighting came to naught, just like todays gloomy forecasts will.What Dubais rulers have achieved in less than four 
decades is nothing short of incredible. I know firsthand. My first visit there was in 1975 when it was mostly sand 
interspersed with a few roads, a hospital, some schools and souks around the Creek. Its only recognizable landmark was 
the Dubai Clocktower. Its only five-star hotel was the newly-built Intercontinental. At that time, few outsiders had even 
heard of the place, whereas, today, it fills miles of column inches each year. The fact that it has gained such prominence in 
such a short time is worth applauding, even if. over the past year or so much of it has been negative.TAKE The Observer. 
for instance. During last Sunday alone, it has published a veritable slew of vitriolic articles centered on Dubai. In one day, 
there was As Dubai crashes from wonder to blunder, who will go down with it? Dubais property bonanza just wasnt built 
to last and Dubai: Bling City is dead but the desert dream lives on.What is it with these writers? llavent they got anywhere 
else to moan on about? If making their readers depressed is their thing. they could always tour some of Britain 
crime/drug/yob-ridden housing estates or mosey on over to Americas mushrooming tent cities. Why all this focus on 
Dubai?In a word: Envy. Dubais tax-free. sunshine-filled. glamorous lifestyle is the stuff of dreams for British commuters 
slogging away struggling to pay their mortgages and bills with Saturday night out down the pub the highlight of their 
week.Then there arc those who cannot stomach the fact that an Arab country, a Muslim country, has created a Utopia in 
the desert, and, worse, set itself up as a benchmark of excellence. If it consisted of clusters of thatched-roof huts with a 
luxury tourist resort or two, they would be saying how wonderfully picturesque it was.Then they could wander around, buy 
a few trinkets, throw a few coins to smiling kids and feel oh so superior. Dubai isnt humble enough for them.Thats my take 
and lin sticking to it. Johann Hari of The Independent has gone so far as to call Dubai a sinister mirage in the desert. Oh 
please! lie just cannot help envy seeping out of his every phrase. Ile is obviously offended at what he calls bragging 
Emiratis and Westerners who love Dubai because they have domestic slaves to do all the hard work. In all my 14 years 
living and working in Dubai. I never came across a single slave or the chain gangs he mentions.The people 1 met there 
from all over the world chose to come to Dubai because they could earn money to send to their families and, once they had
