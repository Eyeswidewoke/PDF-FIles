Russia and Oil's slide have caused investors to sell perceived risky investments such as commodities. The US is expected

keep interest rates near zero for a "=considerable time". Russia is expected to increase the production of base metals in 
response to the falling Ruble as metals are sold in USD. Co=per prices followed the complex but closed up on the day.
