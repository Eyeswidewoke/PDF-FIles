Subject: Judge Marra's Order re Epstein 
Date: Wed, 20 May 2009 00:15:29 +0000 
Importance: Normal 
Hi everyone — I am back and have had a chance to review Judge Marra's order, Epstein's motion to stay the civil 
litigation, and the responses from some of the plaintiffs' lawyers. 
In short, Epstein is seeking a "discretionary stay" of all of the civil litigation until the end of his term of house 
arrest when, according to Epstein's lawyers, the Non-Prosecution Agreement "expires." (I don't really agree that 
the Agreement "expires" then, but that is another issue.) According to Epstein's calculation, this would be the 
end of 2010. Epstein claims that we have the sole right to declare that the agreement has been breached and 
move forward with a prosecution. He has been asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege to answer any and all 
interrogatories or to produce any documents (including the Non-Prosecution Agreement). Normally, this would 
result in the drawing of an adverse inference against him, and, basically, an automatic finding of fault for the 
plaintiffs. As usual, Epstein wants to have his cake and eat it, too. He wants our agreement to expire and then be 
free to breach the agreement with impunity. (I note that, while Epstein has refused to provide any discovery, he 
has insisted on receiving discovery from the plaintiffs, including a list of names and phone numbers of every 
man with whom they have had a sexual relationship, beginning when the plaintiffs were 10 years' old.) 
Judge Marra has asked for our opinion on the matter. 
Here is my proposal: We respond to Judge Marra by stating that, as has been noted in the plaintiffs' pleadings, it 
was the United States' intent to place the victims in the same position where they would have been if Epstein had 
been convicted after trial. As Judge Marra noted in his initial order on Epstein's first motion to stay, Epstein has 
the keys to his own handcuffs - if he abides by the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the criminal matter will remain 
in abeyance. As to Epstein's assertion that the USAO has unfettered discretion in declaring the agreement 
breached, this is no different than any other contract. If one party believes that the other has breached, they may 
seek the remedy set forth in the contract. If the other party believes that it hasn't breached the agreement, that is 
what courts are for. I will insert some cases where a prosecution has been dismissed because of the breach of an 
agreement. 
With respect to Epstein's claim that we will "trump up" some claim of breach and then use the civil discovery to 
prosecute him, I will note that, as part of the Non-Pros Agreement, each party accepted that risk. We provided 
Epstein with the list of the victims, which we otherwise would not have been obligated to do, and he is being 
allowed extensive civil discovery of them, which he would be able to use in his defense if a criminal prosecution 
were instituted. Also, if this claim is legitimate, Epstein would have recourse during the criminal prosecution to 
try to exclude that evidence from being used against him. 
Lastly, Epstein relies on some ll th Circuit cases that say that it is unfair to draw a negative reference against a 
defendant who legitimately asserts the 5th Amendment privilege where drawing that inference would 
automatically result in the grant of summary judgment for the plaintiff For this reason, according to Epstein, the 
Court should grant a stay. I would point out that this result doesn't apply to the Epstein case. In order to succeed 
on a 2255 claim, the victim must show: (1) that she was a victim of a crime committed by Epstein; (2) that she
