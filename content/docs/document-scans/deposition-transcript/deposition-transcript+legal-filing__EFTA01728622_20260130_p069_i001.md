Child pornography, by itself, 
represents an act of sexual 
abuse or exploitation of 
a child and, by itself, 
does harm to that child. 
Preferential sex offenders with the economic means pre-
viously converted parts of their collections to videotape 
when that technology became available. They converted 
their books, magazines, photographs, and movies to video-
tape. For a seemingly ever-decreasing price, an offender 
could have his own video camera and two video recorders, 
which gave him the capability to produce and duplicate 
obscene material or child pornography with little fear of 
discovery. Although videotape still has a significant appeal, 
an ever-increasing portion of most collections is now being 
digitally stored or duplicated on computers and disks.

What the pedophile collects can be divided into two categories. They are child 
pornography and child erotica. Child pornography can be behaviorally, not 
legally, defined as the sexually explicit reproduction of a child's image and 
includes sexually explicit photographs, negatives, slides, magazines, movies, vid-
eotapes, and computer disks. In essence it is, or was, the permanent record of the 
sexual abuse or exploitation of an actual child. Child pornography, by itself, rep-
resents an act of sexual abuse or exploitation of a child and, by itself, does harm to 
that child. The online computer and Internet, however, have radically changed 
most of what could have been said about the possession and distribution of child 
pornography in the United States iri the 1980s and early 1990s. 
Legal definitions of the term "child pornography" vary 
from state-to-state and under federal law. Under most 
definitions child pornography usually involves a visual 
depiction (not the written word) of a child (a minor as 
defined by statute) that is sexually explicit (not neces-
sarily obscene unless required by state law). The federal 
child-pornography law (18 U.S.C.A. § 2256) defines a child 
or minor as someone who has not yet reached his or her 
eighteenth birthday. In contrast to adult pornography, but 
consistent with the gender preference of many pedophiles, 
there is a high percentage of boys in child pornography. 
Because true child pornography once was hard to 
obtain, some pedophiles have or had only child erotica in 
their collections (see discussion of child erotica beginning 
on page 65); however, because of online computers, child 
pornography is now more readily available in the United 
States than it has been since the late 1970s. Child pornogra-
phy is so readily available on the Internet, it is possible to 
store a collection in cyberspace and download it anytime 
one wants to view it. Because it represents his sexual fan-
tasies (e.g., age and gender preferences, desired sexual acts) 
the collection of any child molester should be carefully 
examined and evaluated. 
Previous research I conducted with Drs. Carol R. Hartman and Ann W. 
Burgess identified four kinds of child-pornography collectors. They are "closet,"
