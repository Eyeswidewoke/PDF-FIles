alienation, and possession that survived the death of the Decedent." 
"The record on appeal is sufficient for us to render a final judgment and dispose of the 
sole issue in this case without prolonging it by remand at the cost of more time and money to 
the parties." 
"[We] hold that the correct quantums of the fractional-ownership discounts applicable to 
the Decedent's pro rata share of the stipulated FMVs of the various works of art are those 
determined by the Estate's experts...." 
As you can read in the above quotes from the Fifth Circuit, this was a complete rejection of the Tax 
Court's valuation discount decision in Elkins. As a sop to the Judge in Elkins, the Fifth Circuit stated, 
"We are never comfortable in disagreeing with, much less reversing, a jurist of the experience, 
reputation, and respect enjoyed by the Tax Court judge whose work product we are called on to 
review today. Yet, our review of the court's extensiveexplication of this case and its ultimate 
conclusion that the proper discount is 10 percent, leaves us with the `definite and firm conviction that 
a mistake has been made.'"

121 The Fifth Circuit, while never addressing this issue directly, clearly considered the co-tenant agreement in its 
overturning of the Tax Court's conclusions. This author has previously faulted the Tax Court's decision in Elkins because 
the Tax Court failed to consider the exceptions to Section 2703(a) found in Section 2703(b). The co-tenant agreement 
appeared to qualify under each of the three exceptions in Section 2703(b).
