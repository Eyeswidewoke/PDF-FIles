Fourth. The federal statutes at issue in this case are far more draconian than the state 
statutes. 
Tlx: federal statutes carry far higher minimum mandatory sentences and higher 
guidelines. The courts have always required greater clarity, predictability and certainty in the 
application of harsh statutes than less harsh ones. 
Fifth. It would raise protbtmd issues of federal criminal enlintement fix your Office 
deliberately to apply a more permissive statute to its own work than to a state statute. It would 
he unconscionable not to apply at least as rigorous a standard of certainty and clarity to your 
Office's indictment than to a state statute. even one that is pail of a deal made by your Unice. It 
would he unseemly in the extreme fur your Office to apply a more permissive standard to its own 
work than to a state statute. 
We believe strongly that a dispassionate and fair review of the facts will reveal that even 
if the same standards were to he applied to the applicability Iv/ non of the state and federal 
statutes, the conclusion could not in good conscience be reached that the Florida statute is 
inapplicable, while at the same time concluding that the federal statutes arc applicable. The 
daunting standards that must be applied to federal statutes include the folluning: 
• 
The Rule of Lenity: 'the Supreme Court has long held that criminal statutes that are 
subject to differing interpretations should be construed in the defendant's favor. See 
I'usquunlino v. us 544 U.S. 349. 383 (2005) ("We have long held that, when 
confronted with 'two rational readings of a criminal statute, one harsher titan the other. 
we are to choose the harsher only when Congress has spoken in clear and definite 
language."') (citing United States v. McNally. 41O U.S. 350. 359-360 (1987): United 
Slake V. Unkerfal CIT.  Credit Corp.. 344 
218. 221-222 09529 Funhamore, the 
rule of lenity also applies to Florida state criminal law. See Register r. Slate. 715 So.2d 
274, 278 (Fla. 1st 1)C.4 1998) rib the extent that penal statutory language is indefinite 
or 'is susceptible of differing constructions.' due pn'ccss requires a strict construction of 
the language in the defendant's favor under the rule of lenity") (riling F. Stat.
775.021( I ) (1995): Perkins it State, 576 So.2d 1310. 1312 (Fla. 1991): Logan it State, 
666 So.2d 260. 261 (Fla. 4th ocA 1996)). 
• 
Plain Meaning: Commonly accepted prineiplas of statutory law require that statutes he 
given their plain and unambiguous meaning. wont: exists. Sec !ligroin v. New York 
Trust Ca. 292 U.S. 455. 469 (1934) ("Under the recognized macs of construction we

omitted).

conduct Congress has made a crime. it is appropriate. belbre we choose the harsher 
alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and
