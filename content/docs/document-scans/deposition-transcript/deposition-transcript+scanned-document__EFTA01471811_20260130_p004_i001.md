determined; 
"Margin Ratio", with respect to a Transaction, the Market Value of the 
Purchased Securities at the time when the Transaction was entered into 
divided by the Purchase Price (and so that, where a Transaction relates to 
Securities of different descriptions and the Purchase Price is apportioned 
by the parties among Purchased Securities of each such description, a 
separate Margin Ratio shall apply in respect of Securities of each such 
description), or such other proportion as the parties may agree with respect 
to that Transaction; 
"Margin Securities", in relation to a Margin Transfer, Securities reasonably 
acceptable to the party calling for such Margin Transfer; 
"Margin Transfer", any, or any combination of, the payment or repayment of 
Cash Margin and the transfer of Margin Securities or Equivalent Margin 
Securities; 
"Market Value", with respect to any Securities as of any time on any date, 
the price for such Securities at such time on such date obtained from a 
generally recognised source agreed to by the parties (and where different 
prices are obtained for different delivery dates, the price so obtainable 
for the earliest available such delivery date) (provided that the price of 
Securities that are suspended shall (for the purposes of paragraph 4) be nil 
unless the parties otherwise agree and (for all other purposes) shall be the 
price of those Securities as of close of business on the dealing day in the 
relevant market last preceding the date of suspension) plus the aggregate 
amount of Income which, as of such date, has accrued but not yet been paid 
in respect of the Securities to the extent not included in such price as of 
such date, and for these purposes any sum in a currency other than the 
Contractual Currency for the Transaction in question shall be converted into 
such Contractual Currency at the Spot Rate prevailing at the relevant time; 
"Net Exposure", the meaning specified in paragraph 4(c); 
the "Net Margin" provided to a party at any time, the excess (if any) at 
that time of (i) the sum of the amount of Cash Margin paid to that party 
(including accrued interest on such Cash Margin which has not been paid to 
the other party) and the Market Value of Margin Securities transferred to 
that party under paragraph 4(a) (excluding any Cash Margin which has been 
repaid to the other party and any Margin Securities in respect of which 
Equivalent Margin Securities have been transferred to the other party) over 
(ii) the sum of the amount of Cash Margin paid to the other party (including 
accrued interest on such Cash Margin which has not been paid by the other 
party) and the Market Value of Margin Securities transferred to the other 
party under paragraph 4(a) (excluding any Cash Margin which has been repaid 
by the other party and any Margin Securities in respect of which Equivalent 
Margin Securities have been transferred by the other party) and for this 
purpose any amounts not denominated in the Base Currency shall be converted 
into the Base Currency at the Spot Rate prevailing at the relevant time; 
"Net Paying Securities", Securities which are of a kind such that, were they 
to be the subject of a Transaction to which paragraph 5 applies, any payment 
made by Buyer under paragraph 5 would be one in respect of which either 
Buyer would or might be required to make a withholding or deduction for or 
on account of taxes or duties or Seller might be required to make or account 
for a payment for or on account of taxes or duties (in each case other than 
tax on overall net income) by reference to such payment;
