Just landed in NY. Will call as soon as I can. =e are going to hire a PR firm to help with the latest articles. I also 
nee= to hire a lawyer to make sure everything I say is OK, but I'm sick of=not saying anything. I've written down a few 
thoughts on the plane: =C2*I'm sure it's too much info, but here is first draft. </=iv> 
I vehemently deny any=allegations that I so called "helped procure" prostitutes for JE= I used to be an executive 
assistant who scheduled appointments for Mr E.;=some of these appointments were for massages. I was never privy to 
what to=k place during those massages. I never had anyone complain to me that some=hing untoward was happening, 
nor did I ever witnesses anything questionabl= take place. I had never seen any of these masseuses before until they 
arr=ved at the house of their own accord; they certainly did not look underage=to me. I knew nothing about them. I 
never spoke to them other than to sche=ule massage appointments. I'm sorry if these women now regret their ac=ions 
and professions, but I had nothing to do with it. I'm sure the al=ure of making millions off their regrettable decisions is 
enticing, especi=lly when their lawyers are willing to work for free to make a name for the=selves. I have been unfairly 
victimized by these Jane Does, whom I don'=t even know who they are, their lawyers, and by the media making up 
endles= lies about me and making up outrageous allegations all because I followed=the advice of my lawyers to plead 
the Fifth for every single question</=> asked of me, even a question as simple as "what is your name?"=I plead the Fifth 
on, in a civil suit which I was subpoenaed for. I was a =oung woman whom all of a sudden my name was caught up in 
something which l=had no involvement with. I wanted nothing more than to answer all the ques=ions asked of me by 
those unscrupulous lawyers, but felt it was best to fo=low the advice of my own lawyers to plead the Fifth; what did I 
know about=the legal system? So that's what I did and am still paying the price 9=years later. I'm tired of allowing the 
media to abuse me to sell newsp=pers and not defending myself against it. 
True, I once worked for JE and lived in an apt on 66=h St. I started my interior design business in 2006 while also 
working for=1E. Since I couldn't afford a separate office at the time, I used my h=me address for my business address. I 
no longer live at that address, nor =ave I conducted business from that address for many years.
