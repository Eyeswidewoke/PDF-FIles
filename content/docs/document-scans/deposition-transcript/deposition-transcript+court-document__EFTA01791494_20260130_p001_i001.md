opportunity for you to make a substantial amount of money. I work for a newspaper in the UK and would like the 
opportunity to speak with you to put across our offer. I have a colleague in New York now who can meet with you at 
your convenience to discuss financial details of what we can offer you. He is happy to meet confidentially to discuss this 
with you. We have seen pictures of you with Epstein and would like to speak to you about this. What do you think? Kind 
regards 
XX: Can I have a telephone number of your friend? 
Al: Sure. He's called Maz from News of the World and is on: 2016587361. l&=39;ve told him to expect your call. 
Regards. Amanda 
Svetlana : I wonder what do you mean by substantial? 
Al: Maz will be able to explain what we can offer but suffice to say we are the UKs biggest selling paper and pay 
better than anyone else. He can give you a figure that I am sure you will be more than happy with. 
Al: Hi, all ok? Maz is still waiting for your call. He's keen to explai= in detail what our offer will be. I can assure 
you that it will be a confidential discussion and he can talk about payment. There is money available here on our part 
and Maz is happy to talk it through with=20 you. If you have any queries etc he can talk them through with you. Take 
care, Amanda 
XX: What story about Charlesa do you want to make? And which magazine? I need to talk to him first to know 
that he is ok with that. 
AJ: Please speak to Maz. Just give him a call. He can explain our position. It's not about Charles. We have 
pictures of you with Jeffrey.=20 Maz will be able to explain and give you an idea of the money we are talking. 
Svetlana : Which Jeffrey? I m confused now 
AJ: Jeffrey Epstein. This is your chance to make a lot of money. You can help with the words of the story and 
have input. We will enable you to have a photoshoot, hair, make-up etc...In a nutshell this is your chance for fame and 
fortune! As I said, I'm in London but Maz is in New York,=20 awaiting your call and happy to talk to you confidentially 
about the large sum of money we will give you for your cooperation with the story. We sell millions of copies of our 
newspaper and have the resources to pay big money for stories. This is a great offer and opportunity for you. You have 
nothing to lose in talking to Maz about this. He's waitin= to hear from you. Do you have a favourite bar or restaurant? 
Money is no object he can meet you anywhere. His number is (201)6587361 <tel:%28201%296=87361> . Hear wha= he 
has to say at least. 
XX : Amanda, I ye spoken to Charles today and he said that you 1. Wanted to offer me a modeling job 2. Told 
him you knew me personally... Neither of this is true... If it wasn't about him - why would you put=20 his name at the top 
of the text? Are you his new girlfriend trying to get information from me... If so - I m the wrong person to ask now. I m 
sorry, I think our conversation is finished. To cut it short: 1. I don'= want to make story about charles. 2. I don't know 
anything about "Jeffrey" you mention. Best, XX
