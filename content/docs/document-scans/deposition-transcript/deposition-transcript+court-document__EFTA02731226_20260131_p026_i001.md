In addition, consistent with a letter filed with the Court on October 7, 2020, our office 
has obtained and reviewed for Rule 16 material agency files from the FBI's Miami Field Office, 
the Palm Beach Police Department, and the Palm Beach State's Attorney's Office. 
Also consistent with the October 7, 2020 letter, we have taken the following steps to 
obtain additional agency files to review for Brady, Giglio, and Jencks Act material. First, we have 
confirmed with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Georgia that it does not possess any substantive 
witness statements or any material regarding Ghislaine Maxwell. Second, we have obtained all 
emails from the lead AUSA who handled the USAO-SDFL investigation of Epstein, and have run 
keyword search terms through those emails to identify correspondence potentially relevant to our 
case. We are in the process of reviewing that subset of emails. Third, we are still in the process 
of loading scans of the full USAO-SDFL file into Relativity so that our team can conduct a full 
review of that file. Due to technical issues with the vendor who scanned the files in Florida and 
the vendor who handles loading the files into Relativity, this process remains ongoing. 
We have also reviewed with the following members of the prosecution team — FBI 
Special Agent 
and FBI TFO/NYPD Detective 
— the guidance under 
JM 9-5.004 reg 
ing e-communications in a federal criminal case. n particular, the following is 
our plan to preserve for later review and possible disclosure all substantive e-communications 
created or received by team members during the course of an investigation and prosecution, and 
all e-communications sent to or received from lay witnesses, regardless of content: all AUSAs 
have made it their practice to save all emails related to this case in a separate folder within Outlook. 
has saved all emails related to this case from his inbox on the share drive. 
AU As wi review t eir own emails and will divide up the review of 
emails 
for any disclosures that need to be made in advance of trial. Although it is not the team's practice 
to exchange substantive text communications regarding any case or to exchange any text messages 
at all with lay witnesses, all AUSAs will review their own text messages on their government-
provided cellphones to confirm no such text messages exist or need to be disclosed. The AUSAs 
will confer with SA 
and TFO 
and confirm that they have similarly preserved and 
reviewed all of their emails and text messages for any disclosures that need to be made. The 
AUSAs will also confirm that SA 
and TFO M
. have similarly collected and reviewed 
and made any necessary disclosuresfrom any e-communications made or received by any other 
FBI or NYPD employee, including victim-witness personnel, regarding this case or from any lay 
witness. 
This case is not a spin-off from, or a case with significant factual overlap with, another 
SDNY case. 
As discussed above, parts of this case were the subject of an investigation by the 
USAO-SDFL and the Palm Beach State's Attorney's Office. We have reviewed the PBSA file for 
disclosures and will similarly review the USAO-SDFL file once it is loaded into Relativity. 
This case is not being conducted in coordination with another prosecutor's office or 
another federal or state agency.
