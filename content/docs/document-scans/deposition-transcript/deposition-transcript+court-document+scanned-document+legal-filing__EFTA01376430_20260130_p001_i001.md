(b) 
The Calculation Agent shall be required to agree that, as soon as 
reasonably possible after 11:00 a.m. London time on each LIBOR Determination Date, but in no 
event later than 11:00 a.m. London time on the London Business Day immediately following 
each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will cause the Note Interest Rate for 
each Class of Senior Notes for the related Periodic Interest Accrual Period and the Note Interest 
Amount for such Periodic Interest Accrual Period payable in respect of each such Class of Senior 
Notes (in each case, rounded to the nearest cent, with half a cent being rounded upward) on the 
related Payment Date to be communicated to the Co-Issuers, the Trustee, each Paying Agent, the 
Collateral Manager, Euroclear and Clearstream, the Holders of Notes and, so long as any Class 
of the Senior Notes are listed thereon, the Irish Stock Exchange. In the latter case, such 
information will be published by the Calculation Agent in the Daily Official List of the Irish 
Stock Exchange as soon as possible after its determination. The Calculation Agent shall be 
required to separately notify the Irish Stock Exchange of such information. The Calculation 
Agent will also specify to the Co-Issuers the quotations upon which the foregoing rates and 
amounts are based, and in any event the Calculation Agent shall notify the Co-Issuers before 
5:00 p.m. London time on every LIBOR Determination Date that either: (i) it has determined or 
is in the process of determining the Note Interest Rate and Note Interest Amount for each Class 
of Senior Notes; or (ii) it has not determined and is not in the process of determining any such 
Note Interest Rate or Note Interest Amount together with its reasons therefor. The Calculation 
Agent's determination of the foregoing rates and amounts for any Periodic Interest Accrual 
Period will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding upon all parties. 
Section 7.17 Certain Tax Matters. 
(a) 
In the absence of controlling authority to the contrary, the Issuer shall treat 
the Senior Notes as debt of the Issuer and the Income Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes. 
(b) 
The Issuer shall provide to any Holder of an Income Note, as soon as 
practicable after the end of each tax year of the Issuer, upon written request therefor certifying 
that it is such a Holder, (i) all information that a U.S. shareholder making a "qualified electing 
fund" election (as defined in the Code) is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes 
and (ii) a "PFIC Annual Information Statement" as described in Treasury Regulation Section 
1.1295-1 (or any successor Internal Revenue Service release or Treasury Regulation), including 
all representations and statements required by such statement, and will take any other reasonable 
steps necessary to facilitate such election by a Holder of an Income Note. Upon written request 
by the Independent Accountants, the Registrar shall provide to the Independent Accountants that 
information contained in the Register requested by the Independent Accountants to comply with 
this Section. 
(c) 
The Issuer has not and will not elect to be treated as other than a 
corporation for U.S. federal, state or local income or franchise tax purposes and shall make any 
election necessary to avoid classification as a partnership or disregarded entity for U.S. federal, 
state or local tax purposes. 
(d) 
The Issuer will treat each purchase of Collateral Obligations as a 
"purchase" for tax accounting and reporting purposes.
