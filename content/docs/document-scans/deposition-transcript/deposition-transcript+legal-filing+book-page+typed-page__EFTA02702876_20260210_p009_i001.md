Fig. 13. Non-monotonic efficiency functions can lead to rich and counterintuitive behavior. We consider invasion and stability of a dominant police allele for single (n I) 
and double (n-2) mating. The baseline colony efficiency without policing is re - I. Mice other values must be specified: ri 
and r,. Moreover. we need to specify two 
values for how the presence of police workers affects the fraction of malt offspring coming from the queen; we choose Viz —0.99 and Pi — 1. A variety of behaviors can be 
realized by a very small variation in colony efficiency. (a) Policing invades for single mating but not for double mating. (b) Policing does not invade but is stable for single and 
double mating. (c) Policing invades but is unstable for single and double mating. (d) Policing does not invade but is stable for single mating. while policing invades but Is

workers). then policing can invade for n= 1.2.3 or n=2.3 or 
n=3 or not at all. 
(v) If rz reaches an intermediate minimum (which means colony 
efficiency is lowest for an intermediate fraction of police 
workers), then policing can invade with any pattern of mat-
ings. For example, it is possible that policing invades only for 
single mating but neither for double nor triple mating. Or it 
invades for single and double mating but not for triple mating. 
7.2. Evolutionary stability of policing 
(i) If rz is constant. then policing is unstable for single mating, is 
neutral for double mating, and is stable for triple mating. 
(ii) If r, is monotonically decreasing, then policing is unstable for 
single and double mating. For triple mating it can be stable or 
unstable. 
(iii) If r, is monotonically increasing, then policing either is always 
stable or is stable only for double and triple mating. 
(iv) If r, reaches an intermediate maximum, then policing can be 
stable for any pattern of matings. For example, policing can be 
stable for single mating but neither for double nor triple 
mating. 
(v) If r; reaches an intermediate minimum, then policing can be 
stable for n = 1.2.3 or n=2.3 or n=3 or not at all. 
7.3. Examples for single and double mating 
Fig. 13 gives some interesting examples for how non-
monotonic efficiency functions can influence the evolution of 
policing for single (n=1) and double (n=2) mating. In order to 
discuss the invasion and stability of a dominant police allele for 
single and double mating, we need to specify efficiency at three 
discrete values for the fraction of police workers present in a 
colony: r112. r314. and rt. Note that re, = 1 is the baseline. Moreover. 
we need to specify the fraction of male offspring coming from the 
queen at two values: P1,2 and pi. For all examples in Fig. 13, we 
assume pi/2 =0.99 and PI = 1. We show four cases: (a) policing 
invades for single mating but not for double mating; (b) for both 
single and double mating, policing does not invade but is stable: 
(c) for both single and double mating. policing invades but is 
unstable (leading to coexistence of policing and non-policing 
alleles): (d) policing does not invade but is stable for single mat-
ing: policing invades but is unstable for double mating. These 
cases demonstrate the rich behavior of the system. which goes 
beyond the simple view that multiple matings are always favor-
able for the evolution of policing. 
8. Gradual evolution of worker policing 
Our main calculation applies to mutations of any effect size. In 
this section. we calculate the limit of incremental mutation (small 
mutational effect size). Our calculations in this section are remi-
niscent of adaptive dynamics (Nowak and Sigmund, 1990; Hof-
bauer and Sigmund. 1990; 0ieckmann and Law. 1996; Metz et al.. 
1996; Geritz et al., 1998). which is usually formulated for asexual 
and haploid models. The analysis in this section applies both to the 
case of small phenotypic effect and to the case of weak penetrance. 
Mathematically, we consider the evolutionary dynamics of poli-
cing if the phenotypic mutations induced by the a allele are small. If 
an allele affecting intensity of policing is dominant, then it is intui-
tive to think of wild-type workers as policing with intensity ZA.R.
