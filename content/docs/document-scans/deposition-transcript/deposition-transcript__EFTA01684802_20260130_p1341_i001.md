Notice of Important Membership Rewards® Program Changes 
We are making changes to the Membership Rewards Program Terms & Conditions that affect OPEN Business 
Card Members. A summary of the changes appears below. The detailed changes can be found after the 
summary chart. 
Summary of Changes, effective September 9, 2016 
(Please note that these changes apply only to OPEN Business Card Members.) 
Who can use 
the program 
The Basic Business Card Member must be enrolled in the Membership Rewards program in 
order for an Additional Business Card Member to have his or her own Membership Rewards 
program account. 
If the Basic Business Card Member exits the program, we will cancel an Additional Business 
Card Member's participation in Membership Rewards and, if applicable, that Card Member's 
Membership Rewards account. 
An Additional Business Card Member who has a separate Membership Rewards account 
may not link other program-eligible Cards to that account. 
Buying points 
If an Additional Business Card Member has a separate Membership Rewards account and 
chooses to buy points for that separate Membership Rewards account, the Basic Business 
Card Member on the Business Card account will be responsible for the buying points fee. 
Reinstating 
points forfeited 
for making late 
payments 
Points forfeited for late payment on a Business Card account (including points which would 
have been awarded to an Additional Business Card Member with a separate Membership 
Rewards account) can be reinstated only by the Basic Business Card Member on the 
Business Card account. The fee for reinstating points (currently $35) will be charged to 
the Business Card account. By paying this reinstatement fee, the Basic Business Card 
Member may reinstate all points which would have been awarded to all Card Members on 
the Business Card account for a single billing period. 
Forfeiting 
and getting 
points back for 
canceling your 
account 
If the Basic Business Card Member voluntarily cancels enrollment in the program, this 
will also cancel the Additional Business Card Member's separate Membership Rewards 
account. However, if the Additional Business Card Member has at least one American 
Express Card open and in good standing, the Additional Business Card Member will have 
up to 30 days from the date of cancellation to use any points in the separate Membership 
Rewards account. If the Additional Business Card Member doesn't have any open American 
Express Cards, all points in the separate Membership Rewards account will be immediately 
forfeited. 
Excise tax 
offset fee 
We have added clarifying language confirming that the Basic Business Card Member on 
the Business Card account will be responsible for any excise tax offset fees incurred by 
Additional Business Card Members who have their own Membership Rewards accounts. 
Detail of the Changes 
This notice amends the Membership Rewards Program Terms & Conditions (the "Terms & Conditions") as 
described below. We have the right to amend as described in the Terms & Conditions. Any terms in the Terms 
& Conditions conflicting with this change are replaced fully and completely. Terms not changed by this notice 
remain in full force and effect. We encourage you to read this notice, share it with Additional Card Members on 
your account, and file it for future reference. If you have any questions about this change, please call the number 
on the back of your Card. All changes are effective September 9, 2016. See the following page(s) for the Detail 
of the Changes.
