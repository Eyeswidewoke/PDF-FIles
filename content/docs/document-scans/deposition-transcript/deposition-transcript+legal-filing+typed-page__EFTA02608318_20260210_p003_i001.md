has long been treated =s a matter entrusted to laws of the several States, not the federal govern=ent. The conduct —
for which Jeffrey took ful= responsibility — was a classic state offense and was tr=ated exactly that way by able, honest 
prosecutors in Palm Beach County. =AO Nevertheless, without a request from the state prosecutors, t=e federal 
government intervened. For their own opportunistic reasons= many are now criticizing the federal decision-makers at 
the time, includi=g now-Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta (then-United States Attorney in south=Florida), for not going far 
enough. 
<=> 
The critics are wrong on the facts and the law. They also=ignore a fact going to 
the heart of fundamental fairness: In th= decade since paying his debt to society, Jeffrey Epstein has led a life 
c=aracterized by responsible citizenship, numerous acts of generosity and go=d deeds. 
Here are =he true key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made busi=essman 
with no prior criminal history whatsoever, engaged in illegal condu=t that amounted to solicitation of prostitution. That 
=A0conduct was wrong and a violation of Florida state law. Although n= coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs or the like 
were involved, some of the=women he paid were under the age of 18. Those facts were c=refully assessed by 
experienced state sex crime prosecutors who aggressive=y enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to 
potentia= offenses to the public order. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State=Attorney's Office conducted an extensive 
fifteen-month investigation, =ed by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then ind=cted by the state 
grand jury on a single felony count of solicitation of p=ostitution. 
During that intense investigation, the state p=osecutors extensively gathered 
and analyzed the evidence, met face-to=face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility =80 or lack 
thereof — and considered the extent of exculpatory e=idence, including sworn testimony from many that they lied 
=bout being eighteen years old to be allowed into Mr. Epstein's hom=. After months of negotiations, the state 
prosecutors believed they =ad reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public =nterest — a 
resolution entirely consistent with that of cases invo=ving other similarly-situated defendants. The system worked as it 
sh=uld have. 
=hen, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office exten=ively and 
aggressively investigated whether Mr. Epstein had engaged in a c=mmercial human trafficking ring, targeted minors, or 
used the interne= or traveled interstate in the process. But that's not =hat this was and that's not what happened. That 
is prec=sely why the federal authorities' ultimate decision to defer=C2 prosecution to the state was the right one. a> 
However, the federally-demanded r=solution was not without conditions. The 
federal prosecutors insisted on v=rious unorthodox requirements that Mr. Epstein's experienced =efense team had 
never seen imposed on any defendant anywhere. Under the fe=erally-forced deal, Jeffrey was required to request that 
the state pr=secutors demand the imposition of a thirty-month sentence that included =A0both jail time and the 
strictest conditions of probation: life=ime sex-offender registration. Those draconian measures were far more=than 
warranted by the state grand jury's indictment and would=not have otherwise been required under the previously 
agreed-upon state di=position. As part of this highly unusual deal, the government re=uired Jeffrey to pay for a highly 
experienced group of attorneys=to bring claims against him on behalf of a government list of asserted vic=ims. Jeffrey 
was required to waive the right to challenge those claims wit=out being provided the asserted victim's identities by the
