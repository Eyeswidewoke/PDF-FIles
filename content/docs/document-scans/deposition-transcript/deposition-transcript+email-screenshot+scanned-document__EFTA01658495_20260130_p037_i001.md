US Sanctions More Syrians In Push For Assad To End War. 
Reuters (9/30, Psaledakis) reports the US on Wednesday "blacklisted what it called 'key 
enablers' of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, reinforcing efforts to push 
Damascus back to United Nations-led negotiations to end Syria's nearly decade-long civil war." 
The US sanctioned 13 entities and six individuals, including the governor of the Central Bank of 
Syria. In a statement, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said, "The United States will continue to 
employ all of its tools and authorities to target the finances of anyone who profits from or 
facilitates the Assad regime's abuse of the Syrian people." 
Taliban's Team Of Peace Negotiators Comprised Of "Old Guard." 
The Washington Post (9/30, George, Tassal, Khan, 14.2M) reports the Taliban negotiating team 
engaged in talks with the Afghan government "comprises 21 men, most with graying beards 
and biographies that date back to the fight against the Soviet Union." Nearly all of the 
negotiators are "pulled from the organization's old guard, and many served in the militant 
group's shadow government." Several are also "known for links to deadly attacks, including on 
civilians; others are essentially unknown outside of the group." To the Post, a "key challenge for 
the Taliban will be maintaining command of its thousands of rank-and-file fighters, as talks are 
likely to force compromises." 
North Korea Continuing Building Nuclear Capability Amid Talks With Trump. 
The Washington Post (9/30, Warrick, Denyer, 14.2M) reports on its front page that while North 
Korean leader Kim Jong-un was writing letters to President Trump in 2018, "at six of the 
country's missile bases, trucks hauled rock from underground construction sites as workers dug 
a maze of new tunnels and bunkers, allowing North Korea to move weapons around like peas in 
a shell game." Outside Pyongyang, meanwhile, "new buildings sprouted across an industrial 
complex that was processing uranium for as many as 15 new bombs, according to current and 
former US and South Korean officials, as well as a report by a United Nations panel of experts." 
While North Korea has refrained from carrying out provocative tests of nuclear weapons during 
its talks with the US, "it never stopped working on them, US intelligence officials said." In fact, 
"new evidence suggests that Kim took advantage of the lull by improving his ability to hide his 
most powerful weapons and shield them from future attacks." 
Vatican Denies Pompeo An Audience With Pope Over China Tension. 
Reuters (9/30, Pullella) reports that on Wednesday, the Vatican "said...it had denied a request 
from Mike Pompeo for an audience with Pope Francis, and accused the Secretary of State of 
trying to drag the Catholic Church into the U.S. presidential election by denouncing its relations 
with China." To Politico, the "extraordinary remarks from the two top diplomatic officials at the 
Vatican came after Pompeo accused the Church in an article and a series of tweets this month 
of putting its `moral authority' at risk by renewing an agreement with China over the 
appointment of bishops." Pompeo, "who was in Rome on Wednesday and due to meet Vatican 
officials on Thursday," nevertheless "repeated his denunciations of China's record on religious 
freedom at an event hosted by the U.S. embassy to the Holy See." 
The AP (9/30, Winfield) reports Pompeo "urged the Vatican on Wednesday to join the 
United States in denouncing violations of religious freedom in China, saying the Catholic Church 
should be at the forefront in the fight to insist on basic human rights there." Pompeo's appeal 
"took place at the same time the Vatican is entering into delicate negotiations with Beijing on 
extending their controversial agreement on nominating bishops for China." 
The New York Times (9/30, Jakes, 18.61M) reports that "to some observers on both sides 
of the tensions between the Roman Catholic Church and the Trump administration, Mr.
