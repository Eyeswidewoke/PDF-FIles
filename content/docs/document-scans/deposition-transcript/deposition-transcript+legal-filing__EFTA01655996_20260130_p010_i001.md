OTHER FBI NEWS 
FBI Seeks Tips on Gender-Affirming Surgeries for Children 
Axios (06/02, Rubin) reported that the FBI on Monday requested tips from the public on hospitals, clinics or 
practitioners performing gender-affirming surgeries to youth. "Help the FBI protect children," the FBI wrote. "As 
the Attorney General has made clear, we will protect our children and hold accountable those who mutilate them 
under the guise of gender-affirming care." The Hill (06/02, Crisp) reported that according to the independent KFF 
policy tracker, youth gender-affirming care has been outlawed in 27 states — starting with Arkansas in 2021. 
Seventeen states are facing legal challenges over the restrictions, so they have been temporarily put on hold. The 
article mentioned that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has adopted the position that it 
"rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children, by promoting their chemical and surgical 
mutilation, and to women, by depriving them of their dignity, safety, well-being, and opportunities," and 
it removed a web page on gender-affirming care from its website because it "does not reflect biological reality and 
therefore the Administration and this Department rejects it." The FBI's call for tips comes as the LGBTQ community 
celebrates Pride Month and Washington, D.C., hosts the 2025 World Pride festivities. 
Utah Teenager Located Safe and in Good Health After Going Missing in April 
The Guardian (06/02, Dunbar) reported that a 15-year-old Utah girl, who vanished in April, has been located safe 
and in good health in Colorado Springs, authorities confirmed late on Sunday night. According to Sgt Shaun Becker, 
Alisa Petrov walked into the Colorado Springs police department earlier that evening and identified herself. Officials 
stated she appeared to be unharmed and physically well. Alisa had last been seen six weeks ago on 21 April, 
captured on surveillance footage leaving a train platform in Provo. That marked the last known sighting of her until 
this week's development. Investigators have not yet disclosed how she traveled to Colorado or whether she was 
coerced or detained during her time away. The article mentioned that in a Facebook post, Nikolai Petrov shared the 
good news. "We are all really happy that Alisa is found and looking forward to seeing her!' he wrote on Facebook. 
"Special thanks to the South Jordan Police Department who worked on weekends, and to the Salt Lake City FBI who 
helped them. Thank you to all of our friends for your help and support." 
FBI Dallas Office Honors Late Specialist Bryan Myers, Reflects on Lingering Health Impacts of 9/11 
Hoodline (06/02, Dawson) reported that on the anniversary of his passing, the FBI Dallas office took a moment to 
honor the memory of Supervisory Administrative Specialist Bryan Myers, who succumbed to health complications 
tied to his exposure to toxic air during the 9/11 recovery efforts. According to the article, Myers died in 2022, and 
his sacrifice was remembered in a social media post that paid tribute to his dedication and service. The FBI Dallas's 
post, which featured a link to the FBI's Wall of Honor, recognized Myers as part of the broader community of first
