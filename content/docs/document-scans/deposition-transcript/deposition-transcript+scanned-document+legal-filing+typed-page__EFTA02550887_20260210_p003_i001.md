worn, beige cotton curtain separates the men and women who attend the service. A solitary chandelier hangs just above 
the black wooden arc that holds the borrowed Torah, which is brought weekly from the Chabad headquarters. A large 
table covered with prayer books stands in the center, and a picture of the Lubavitcher Rebbe is displayed prominently 
on a nearby wall. During Shabbat, when Jewish congregants are strictly prohibited from working, they have to rely on 
the Muslim workers at the center or on Drammeh to do simple chores such as turning on the light and switching on the 
heater. 
At first, it did not make sense, said Hana Kabakow, wife of Rabbi Meir Kabakow. "I was surprised," said the 26-
year-old congregant who was born and raised in Israel. "But when I came here I understood." The Kabakows have been 
coming to the service from Brooklyn for the last two years. 
Harriet Miller, another congregant, said she appreciated the center's accommodating the synagogue. "They are 
very sweet people," said the 79-year-old Bronx native and long-time resident of Parkchester, who added that she 
welcomes the new Muslim immigrants in her neighborhood: "We were not brought up to hate." 
Drammeh also understands the importance of teaching tolerance more broadly, and for turning the school—
which was itself founded at the nearby St. Helena Catholic Church on, of all days, Sept. 11, 2001—into a model of sorts 
for religious tolerance in New York. 
"We're not as divided as the media portrays us to be," Drammeh said. "Almost 90 percent of Jewish, Muslim, 
and Christian teachings are the same." 
His latest project involves introducing fifth-grade Jewish and Islamic school students to each other's religious 
traditions. Other participants of the program, now in its sixth year, include the Solomon Schechter School of Manhattan, 
the Al Ihsan Academy of Queens, and the Kinneret Day School of Riverdale. At the end of the program, students organize 
an exhibit that shows family artifacts of their respective cultures and religion. The principal of the Islamic school, who is 
also Sheik Drammeh's wife, said that even after the program ended, the participants became "fast friends" and would 
visit each other's homes. 
"They would have birthday parties together," Shireena Drammeh said. "When someone invites you to their 
house, I mean, that says it all right there and then." 
While the Jewish congregants are thankful for their new home, they hope that one day they can rebuild their 
own synagogue. That day may be far off: Even now that they have space to worship, they still struggle to operate. They 
don't have proper heating inside, and the portable working heater could not reach the separate area where the elderly 
women are seated, forcing them to wear their jackets during the entire service. Congregants are appealing for financial 
support from the Jewish community and other congregations. 
But Leon Bleckman and others say they now also have loftier goals, including reviving the Jewish presence in the 
neighborhood and reaffirming the positive relationship with their Muslim friends. "We are able to co-exist together side 
by side in the same building," said Assistant Rabbi Avi Friedman, 42. "That's sort of like a taste of the future world to 
come—the messianic future where all people live in peace."
