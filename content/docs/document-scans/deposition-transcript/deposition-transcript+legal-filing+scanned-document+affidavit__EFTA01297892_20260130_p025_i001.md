2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129842, * 
The plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction 
over a nonresident defendant. Meier v. Sun Intern, Hotels, Ltd., 288 F.3d 1264, 1268.69 
(11th Cir. 2002). "A prima fade case is established if the plaintiff presents enough 
evidence to withstand a motion for directed verdict." Id. at 1269 (quoting Madara v. Hall, 
916 F.2d 1510, 1514 (11th Cir. 1990)). If the defendant challenges the facts alleged in the 
complaint and submits affidavits to the contrary, the burden traditionally shifts back to the 
plaintiff to produce evidence supporting jurisdiction. Meier, 288 F.3d at 1269; Posner v. 
Essex Ins. Co., Ltd., 178 F.3d 1209, 1215 (11th Cir. 1999). If the plaintiffs complaint and 
supporting evidence conflict with the defendant's affidavits, the court must construe all 
reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Meier, 288 F.3d at 1269; Madara, 916 F.2d 
at 1514. 
A federal court must have both statutory and constitutional authority to assert jurisdiction 
over a nonresident defendant. See McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220. 223, 
78 S. Ct. 199, 2 L. Ed. 2d 223 (1957). In analyzing whether personal jurisdiction exists, the 
court must first determine whether a defendant is subject to jurisdiction under Georgia's 
long-arm statute. If so, the court must then determine if an assertion [*3] of jurisdiction 
would be constitutional. See Madara, 916 F.2d at 1514. 
The Georgia Long-Arm Statute provides, in relevant part: 
A court of this state may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nonresident or his executor or administrator as to a 
cause of action arising from any of the acts, omissions, ownership, use, or possession enumerated in this Code 
section. in the same manner as if he were a resident of the state. if in person or through an agent, he:

O.C.G.A. § 9-10-91 (2007). The long-arm statute confers personal jurisdiction to the full 
extent permitted by the Due Process Clause. Innovative Clinical & Consulting Servs., LLC 
v. First Nat'l Bank, 279 Ga. 672, 620 S.E.2d 352, 355 (Ga. 2005) (construing the first and 
second sections of the statute as reaching to the maximum extent permitted by procedural 
due process). The court, therefore, may bypass statutory analysis and proceed directly to 
an evaluation of whether exercising personal jurisdiction over defendant is consistent with 
the Due Process Clause. See Datacom Warranty Corp. v. The Phone Connection of 
Kansas, Inc., No.06-1835, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76622, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 20, 2006) 
("[I]t is permissible for courts to pass over an analysis of the long arm statute and exercise 
personal jurisdiction if the constitutional requirements are satisfied."). See also Peridyne 
Technology Solutions, LLC v. Matheson Fast Freight, Inc., 117 F. Supp. 2d 1366, 1369 
(N.D. Ga. 2000). 
"The Due Process Clause protects an individual's liberty interest in not being subject to the 
binding judgments of a forum with which he has established N] no meaningful 'contacts, 
ties, or relations."' Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 471-72, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 
85 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1985) (quoting International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 319, 
66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 (1945)). Due process contemplates two types of personal 
jurisdiction: general jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction. Helicopteros Nacionales de 
Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1984). For 
general jurisdiction, a non-resident defendant's contacts with the forum must be
