Baghdad. What was said before is not=important. The Bush administration is looking for a scapegoat."=C24> As 
Chalabi's position of trust with the Pentagon crumbled, he fo=nd a new political position as a champion of Iraq's Shi'ites 
(Chalabi himself was a Shr=te). Beginning January 2004, Chalabi and his clo=e associates promoted the claim that 
leaders around the world were illegal=y profiting from the Oil for Food program. These charges were around=the same 
time that UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi indicated that Chalabi would l=kely not be welcome in a future Iraqi government. 
Up until this time= Chalabi had been mentioned a number of times by Bush/Cheney supporters in=connection with 
possible future leadership positions. Chalabi conten=ed that documents in his possession detailed the misconduct, but 
he did no= provide any documents or other evidence. The U.S. sharply criticize= Chalabi's Oil for Food investigation as 
undermining the credibility o= its own. 
An arrest warrant for alleged counterf=iting was issued for Chalabi on 8 August 2004, while at the same time a wa=rant 
was issued on murder charges against his nephew Salem Chalabi (at the time, head of the Iraqi S=ecial Tribunal), while 
they both were out of the count=y with Chalabi returning to Iraq but was not arrested. Somehow Chala=i regained 
enough credibility to be made deputy prime minister in April 20=5 and at the same time he was made acting oil minister. 
Chalabi and other members of the INC have=been investigated for fraud involving the exchange of Iraqi currency, gran= 
theft of both national and private assets, and many other criminal charge= in Iraq. By 2010 it is=estimated that Chalabi 
had massed a personal fortune in the hundreds of mi=lions of dollars, if not billions. 
Detractors rage about his supply of fabricate= intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction that supposedly 
tricked=Washington into war. Supporters claim he was a heroic dissident who =as never given the chance to transform 
his troubled country into paradise.=C240 The former is definitely true and the later not as he played the rol= of a 
convenient enabler for the Bush/Cheney war in Iraq and if he had nev=r existed, his backers and the American neocons 
would probably have conjur=d up a replacement to serve the same function. 
With the=overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he is one of the victors of the Iraqi War.40=A0 Chalabi's legacy is a 
controversial one, serving at the cente= of the controversial WMD intelligence that justified the war, a matter th=t is 
contentious to this day. However, he played the political game =ell: As an exile who saw little chance of ever returning 
to Iraq, to dying=in his native Baghdad, all made possible by a policy establishment in DC a=l too willing to listen to his 
assessment that overthrowing Saddam would l=ad to a rosy future for Iraq. And without a doubt, Chalabi was a con 
artis= par excellence, but the stream of claims of innocence by American media a=d politicians who supported him are 
acts of shameless con artistry at best=
