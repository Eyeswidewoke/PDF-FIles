From the very =eginning, Due to Mr Epsteins wealth and prominence these reports, pleadings and 
stories have been tabloid fodder rife with exaggeratio=, omission, and outright falsehoods. Though over a decade has 
passed With the passage of time, as the story they told, which is and only ever really was a story about a wealthy Palm 
Beach =E2$4john" who frequenty solicited local prostitution a legitimate reason for a =/ins>quite colorful who got 
caug=t up in a local scandal and would have quickly for frequently soliciting local pr=stitution, becoame old news,had 
not some <=pan> financially and politically motivated private individuals, lawyers and journalists have kept the story 
alive in a financially motivated attempted time and againstrategy to br=athe new life into it.. They have fed and 
continue to feed a public accustomed to tabloid hyperbole with ever more salacious and conspiratorial allegations about 
all=ged sex trafficking, power brokering and political corruption. One of the most agrecious=C20 examples in book 
form seprate and apart fr=m allegations of underage sex with princes academics biz people world leaders 
</=pan> 
new book, TrafficKing, =irst published on July 6, 2016, irresponsibly assembles the worst of 
these allegations and fabricates even more inflammatory ones of her own in order to create a false and wildly 
=xaggerated tale, sold as non fiction about Mr. Epstein and the Plaintiffs,. S=e creates a delusion of and=ispan> their 
<=el datetime="2016-08-14106:59"> participa=ion in <=span>SEX trafficking and other detestable criminal behavior, 
that bears absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the in order to sell books . nothing more =span> truth.

So much so that in January 2015, Jean Luc Brunel, a modeling agent,=long time friend of Mr 
Epstein, who is also unfairly and falsely reviled <=pan>portrayed , without any evidence whatsoever, as a sex trafficker 
in Sarnoff's abhorrent creation, sued Epstein for =ailing to publicly renounce these false allegations leveled against 
Epstein and him, including those perpetuated by Sarnoff.ln her book She makes wild accusations against an industry 
that legitimately hires young women to model. And through her distorted lens turn evey modeling agent into a criminal. 
<=h1> 
=C* 
With Epstein's silence<=el datetime="2016.08-14T07:04"> and, for obvious reasons, a 
dearth of individuals willing to risk their own reputations to defend persons and offensive events depicted with ever 
increasing severity<=del>, a vacuum has been created to allow Sarnoff, a shameless and delusional self-promoter, to 
peddle to a voracious but unsuspecting public an infantil= distortion in the name of human rights. Sarnoff's "TrafficKing" 
is a frighteningly irresponsible compilation =f untested fantastical allegations, unsupportable assumptions, shoddily 
pieced togethe= circumstantial evidence and paranoid speculation. It is =oorly researched, carelessly sourced and 
alarmingly inaccurate. Though presented in s tyle that includes fake footnotes in most chapters. Many <=span>of 
which upon researching do not exist. 
=C* 
Pages 94 through 108 of TrafficKing <=pan>clearly establish that Sarnoff, tells a=tale of her 
having r=cently been terrified during an investigation in Mexico into true sex t=afficking and government corruption, 
was already=primed to accept as given a link between sex trafficking and government corruption. =She says she =ead a 
few articles in which the lawyers representing a few women prosecuting in </=ns>civil cases against Epstein where were 
try=ng to create public pressure on Epstein. What is clear from her narrative is that from the beginning she assumed the 
truth of every negativ= statement asserted against Epstein All the research she conducted thereafter was clearly 
informed by this pre-conceivedand her and completely erroneous notion that Epstein's wealth and power were us=d to 
insulate him and his associates from the consequences of a serious criminal activity. 
=C* 
Sarnoff's bias has made her r=cklessly indifferent to the truth in the Epstein case and 
singularly unwilling to exercise even a modic=m of critical analysis or objectivity. She draws her "facts" and conclusions 
from very obviously biase= and unreliable sources without any scrutiny, due diligence or professional journalistic 
objectivity, choosing to accept without question any and all negative allegations against Mr. Epstein and his associates 
and to fully discard any=and all evidence that demonstrates an absence of credibility of her sources or =he implausibility 
of the information they provide. 
=C* 
Consequently, in TrafficKing, Ms. Sar=off has published a fabrication riddled with blatant 
defamation, particularly relating to the P=aintiffs, their relationships with Epstein and their involvement in the matters 
givin= rise to Mr. Epstein's legal problems. In fact, Sarnoff ignored clear warnings about the problems with her book,
