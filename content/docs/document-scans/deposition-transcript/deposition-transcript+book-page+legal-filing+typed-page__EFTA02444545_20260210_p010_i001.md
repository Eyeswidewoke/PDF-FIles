We scientists do have something 
special to contribute to discussions of 
the outcomes of science. We know some 
things that will be done before they are 
done; we know some things that cannot 
be done at all; we can speculate about 
things that might be done. We can alert 
our neighbors to the possibility of 
change. and be a part of discussions 
and decisions that encourage the good. 
and avoid or forestall the bad. We can 
try to prevent fear of new ideas from 
blocking beneficial 
technology. In 
choosing to work on problems with the 
potential to change society, we should. 
ideally. accept an obligation to help 
society understand how it might benefit. 
and what it might pay, for that change. 
We can suggest what doors can be 
opened, and what might wait in the 
rooms behind them. Our neighbors will 
decide for their own reasons whether 
they would like to open these doors and 
move in. 
Finally: Is there science that must 
not be done? There are easy cases—I 
can see no redeeming virtue of publicly 
available research that develops strains 
of anthrax that are resistant to multiple 
antibiotics—but much of research is not 
easily classified as "good" or "bad". 
Chemistry contributes broadly to the 
foundations of technology, and thus it is 
particularly difficult to guess its future 
impact: a new chemical reaction might 
be used to make a cancer therapeutic or 
a chemical weapon. Some of the oppor-
tunities that seem within the reach of 
investigation, if not within the reach of 
solution—technologies that might sub-
stantially prolong life, or develop new 
forms of life, or lead to sentient systems 
that rival us in intelligence—will do both 
good and harm. At the very minimum, 
*VW. Clint,. S. Ed. 2004, 43 VA: 
those of us who pursue these problems 
should accept an obligation to explain to 
our fellow citizens fully and clearly what 
we are doing, and why, and (to the 
limited extent we can) with what possi-
ble outcomes. 
Humankind will do what it will do, 
but at least everyone should under-
stand—in so far as is possible—what 
the chokes are, and what the conse-
quences might be. Chemistry, if it takes 
more interest in (and responsibility for) 
the full scope of programs—from mol-
ecules, to applications, and to influence 
on society—may be able to use the very 
breadth of its connections to technology 
to help in this explanation. 
After that, the surprises take over. 
The last, most realistic, assumption may 
be that the law of unintended conse-
quences will ultimately apply.
