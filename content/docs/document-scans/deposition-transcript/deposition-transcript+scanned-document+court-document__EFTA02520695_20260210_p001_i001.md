Re: Private and Confidential, in response to our meeting. 
yes..=you are correct.. but even without the attorney I wanted to try =nd assert my rights.. I got shot down.. I expected 
to get shot =own, but nothing has changed in that regard. =nbsp;l have now dealt with this office twice, and they are 
aware of the =ngoing thing with Buzzfeed, and as I told you =efore, the University attorney actually warned me this was 
likely to =appen. 
So, I think all is as it was with that office and they are =oing to do what they would have done anyway, which is to 
interview my =taff.. they asked me on Friday before they =ot my note to send them the name of those who worked for 
Origins from =015 -2016 and I gave them the contact info for my business office =anager at origins, and they thanked 
me..

I wanted to add to his letter, to reiterate =ur concern about how your office was planning to follow up on the 
false and defamatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because this was initiated by an =nline entertainment 
news outlet with a clear agenda and established record of =propagating false allegations about me, rather than by any of 
the individuals they refer to as sources, this should not be considered a credible allegation worthy of investigation. I 
believe that our initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. =hether or not you agree with this, there are =font 
size="4" class="">two things I think are important to establish. =nbsp; 
Firstly, that the University should not propagate what can be false allegations from =such a source by presenting 
them directly to current and/or former employees or to others. To do so would be to further their =ibelous agenda, as 
Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard, I would appreciate seeing copies of the correspondence you might send to 
=urrent or former employees about this in the process of carrying out and concluding your investigation. 
your client, Lawrence =rauss, copied me on his February 23rd em=il communication to the Office of Equity and 
Inclusion. I am writing =o convey the University's position on its responsibility to =onduct administrative investigations 
into allegations of conduct that would violate institutional policy, if true. Because Dr. Krauss has =font size="4" 
class="">retained legal counsel, I am writing directly to you. You may =orward my communication on to your client. 
Without having =irst secured your permission, I did not think it was proper for me to copying =im on this reply.
