September 17, 2013 =- It is said that when famed Austrian diplomat Klemens von Metternich hear= of the death of the 
Turkish ambassador, he said, "I wonder what he m=ant by that?" True or not, serious or a joke, it points out a problem 
of diplomacy. In searching for the meaning b=hind every gesture, diplomats start to regard every action merely as a 
ges=ure. In the past month, the president of the United States treated the act=of bombing Syria as a gesture intended to 
convey meaning rather than as a military action intended to achieve som= specific end. This is the key to understanding 
the tale that unfolded ove= the past month. 
When President Bara=k Obama threatened military action in retaliation for what he claimed was =he use of chemical 
weapons by the Syrian government, he intended a limited=strike that would not destroy the weapons. Destroying them 
all from the air would require widespread air attacks over=an extensive period of time, and would risk releasing the 
chemicals into t=e atmosphere. The action also was not intended to destroy Syrian President=Bashar al Assad's regime. 
That, too, would be difficult to do from the air, and would risk creating a powe= vacuum that the United States was 
unwilling to manage. Instead, the inten=ion was to signal to the Syrian government that the United States was 
disp=eased. 
The threat of war i= useful only when the threat is real and significant. This threat, however= was intended to be 
insignificant. Something would be destroyed, but it wo=Id not be the chemical weapons or the regime. As a gesture, 
therefore, what it signaled was not that it was dang=rous to incur American displeasure, but rather that American 
displeasure d=d not carry significant consequences. The United States is enormously powe=ful militarily and its threats 
to make war ought to be daunting, but instead, the president chose to fram= the threat such that it would be safe to 
disregard it. 
Avoiding Military A=tion 
In fairness, it was=clear at the beginning that Obama did not wish to take military action aga=nst Syria. Two weeks ago I 
wrote that this was "a comedy in three par=s: the reluctant warrior turning into the raging general and finding his 
followers drifting away, becoming the reluc=ant warrior again." Last week in Geneva, the reluctant warrior re-app=ared, 
put aside his weapons and promised not to attack Syria. 
When he took office= Obama did not want to engage in any war. His goal was to raise the thresh=ld for military action 
much higher than it had been since the end of the C=ld War, when Desert Storm, Somalia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq 
and other lesser interventions formed an ongo=ng pattern in U.S. foreign policy. Whatever the justifications for any of 
=hese, Obama saw the United States as being overextended by the tempo of wa=. He intended to disengage from war 
and to play a lesser role in general in managing the international sys=em. At most, he intended to be part of the 
coalition of nations, not the I=ader and certainly not the lone actor. 
He clearly regarded=Syria as not meeting the newly raised standard. It was embroiled in a civi= war, and the United 
States had not been successful in imposing its will i= such internal conflicts. Moreover, the United States did not have a 
favorite in the war. Washington has a Ion= history of hostility toward the al Assad regime. But it is also hostile t= the 
rebels, who -- while they might have some constitutional democrats am=ng their ranks -- have been increasingly falling 
under the influence of radical jihadists. The creation of a nation=state governed by such factions would re-create the 
threat posed by Afghan=stan and leading to Sept. 11, and do so in a country that borders Turkey, =raq, Jordan, Israel and 
Lebanon. Unless the United States was prepared to try its hand again once again at =ccupation and nation-building, the 
choice for Washington had to be "n=ne of the above." 
Strategy and the sp=cifics of Syria both argued for American distance, and Obama followed this=logic. Once chemical 
weapons were used, however, the reasoning shifted. Tw= reasons explain this
