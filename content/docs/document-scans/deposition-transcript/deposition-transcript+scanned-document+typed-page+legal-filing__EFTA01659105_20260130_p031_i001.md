Trotta, Layne) reports, "Millions of Americans appear to be defying health warnings and 
traveling ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, likely exacerbating a surge in coronavirus 
infections before a series of promising new vaccines become widely available." 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (11/23, lead story, 4:05, Brennan, 4.43M) reported in its lead 
story that 50 million Americans are "ignoring warnings from the CDC not to travel" for the 
Thanksgiving holiday, in "a dangerous move that health experts are warning will send the 
deepening crisis into an even faster and deadly her tail spin." Some would-be travelers are 
heeding the warnings about the surge in COVID-19 infections, "causing a spike in cancellations 
at airlines and Amtrak." NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/23, story 6, 1:50, Holt, 6.1M) reported, "It's 
beginning to look a lot like typical holiday travel. Packed airports anticipating the busiest week 
since the start of the pandemic," with little social distancing. However, the Washington Times 
(11/23, Vondracek, 492K) says "many" travelers "apparently are getting tested for COVID-19 
before they leave, with several states reporting an uptick in testing." 
The New York Times (11/23, Belluck, 18.61M) reports, "Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the 
country's top infectious disease specialist, and other health experts relayed a clear message on 
Sunday morning news shows: with coronavirus cases surging to record levels across the 
country, turning nearly every state into a hot zone of transmission, the risk of getting infected, 
whether in transit or in even small indoor gatherings, is high." According to AAA, "up to 50 
million people could be traveling on roads and through airports in the United States over 
Thanksgiving this year...the biggest travel surge since the pandemic began," though the AP 
(11/23, Durbin, Koenig) reports the CDC last week "urged Americans not to travel or spend the 
holiday with people outside their household." 
According to the Washington Post (11/23, Aratani, 14.2M), the CDC "strongly 
recommended" people avoid holiday travel, and "most" locals "seem to be heeding that advice." 
Erin Sauber-Schatz, head of the CDC's Community Intervention and Critical Population Task 
Force, said, "It's been a long outbreak - almost 11 months now - and people are tired. We 
understand that." Sauber-Schatz added, "People want to see their relatives, their friends and 
[celebrate] the way they've always done it, but this year, particularly, we're asking people to be 
as safe as possible and limit their travel." A front-page Wall Street Journal (11/23, Al, Levitz, 
Passy, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) article looks at how Americans seeking to follow the 
health guidance. 
On the lead ABC World News TonightVi (11/23, lead story, 3:35, Muir, 7.2M) broadcast, 
Victor Oquendo reported officials "across the country are sounding the alarm." North Carolina 
Gov. Roy Cooper (D): "Our actions now will determine the fate of many." New York Gov. Andrew 
Cuomo (D): "These are dangerous times that we're in." Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams: 
"I'm asking Americans, I'm begging you, hold on just a little bit longer. Keep Thanksgiving and 
the celebrations small and smart this year." 
However, the New York Times (11/23, McKinley, Ferre-Sadurni, 18.61M) reports that while 
Cuomo "has been preaching a message of sacrifice during the holidays," he "announced on 
Monday...that he had invited his 89-year-old mother, Matilda, and two of his daughters to 
celebrate a very Cuomo Thanksgiving with him this week in Albany," which spurred "a barrage 
of condemnation from his most frequent critics." According to the Times, the New York 
Republican Party "was particularly unsparing, saying, `Andrew Cuomo doesn't need an Emmy, 
he needs a reality check." 
Epidemiologists Question Role Of Informal Gatherings In The Spread Of SARS-
CoV-2. The New York Times (11/23, Mandavilli, 18.61M) reports many health officials have 
said that informal gatherings are driving the spread of coronavirus. However, "many 
epidemiologists are far less certain, saying there is little evidence to suggest that household 
gatherings were the source of the majority of infections since the summer." In addition, "it has 
become much harder to pinpoint any source of any outbreak, now that the virus is so 
widespread and Americans may be exposed in so many ways." In states that collect and report 
detailed information about the spread of the virus, "long-term care facilities, food processing
