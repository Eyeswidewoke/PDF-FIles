DSK and the Euro Crisis (My Counter history) 
The Greek election this Sunday could lead to Greece's exit from the =uro, and, if that happens set off the Doomsday 
clock for the global =inancial system. Could this disaster have been averted if Dominique =trauss-Kahn had kept his 
appointment in Berlin instead of going to =ail? 
DSK: The Counter-History 
By Edward Jay Epstein 
The 1998 movie Sliding Doors illustrates the contingent nature of =eality. At the outset of the film, the character Helen, 
played by Gwyneth Paltrow, rushes to the =ubway after she's fired from her job, but when she reaches it, the =rain's 
doors slide closed. If she'd gotten there one second =arlier, she would have caught the train. The movie then splits into 
=wo separate stories. In the first, Helen slips onto the train before =he doors shut. She then gets home to find her lover 
with another =oman, which causes her to leave him, move out, and find a new lover. =n the second story, Helen misses 
the train, which causes her to have a =inor accident, and, as she gets home too late to discover her =over's infidelity, she 
stays with him. 
The Sliding Doors principle could similarly have changed the story =or those in the presidential suite at the Sofitel at 
12:06 P.M. on May 14, 2011. At =hat moment, DSK had been taking a shower. The maid, Nafissatou Diallo, was making 
her second =ntry into the suite without her cleaning equipment. If DSK had stayed in the shower for just a few =ore 
seconds, Diallo might have heard the shower or seen other signs that the suite was =ccupied. Since maids at the Sofitel 
are not supposed to clean rooms while guests are in them, she =resumably would have exited the suite before he 
emerged from the bathroom. She would then =ave returned to room 2820, where she had left her cleaning cart, and, as 
the guest in that =uite had checked out, she would have finished cleaning it. She would not have encountered DSK, =or 
would she have had a 
degrading sexual experience between 12:06 and 12:13 P.M. She would not =ave had to wait more than an hour near the 
employee entrance. She =ould not have been taken to Roosevelt-St. Luke's Hospital to be =xamined. She would not have 
testified before a grand jury, told =alsehoods under oath, or had her creditability impugned by prosecutors =nd the 
judge, who dismissed the charges against DSK. Nor would she =ave seen her photograph on the cover of Newsweek, 
been interviewed on =ood Morning America, or filed a civil suit against DSK, which, if =uccessful, could result in a multi-
million-dollar payment to her. =nstead, if the sliding shower door had opened differently, she would =ikely still be 
cleaning rooms on the 28th floor of the Sofitel. 
DSK's story would also be very different. But how? On April 13, =012, I met with him at the elegant Pavillon de la Reine 
in the Place des Vosges to discuss =hat might have happened if that sliding door had opened. He a had a very clear 
memory of what he =ad planned to do on that fateful day. He said he'd been rushing to get dressed when he opened 
=he bathroom door and 
encountered the maid. But what if he had stayed in the bathroom a few =ore seconds and not encountered the maid? I 
asked. 
He would have gotten dressed, finished packing his single suitcase, =nd left, which would have taken about five 
minutes. Since it then would have only been 12:11 =.M., he would not have been running behind schedule, so he would 
not =ave had to call his daughter Camille on the IMF BlackBerry that he =sually kept in his jacket pocket. If he had not 
called her, he might =ot have left the phone in a place from which it would go missing. He =ould have checked out, 
caught a taxi on 44th Street, and gone to the =esignated restaurant to meet his daughter and her new boyfriend. After 
=unch, he would have caught a cab to JFK in time to catch Air France =light 23, which left at 4:50 P.M. He would then 
have tried to sleep on =he transatlantic flight, since he had a busy agenda on Sunday.
