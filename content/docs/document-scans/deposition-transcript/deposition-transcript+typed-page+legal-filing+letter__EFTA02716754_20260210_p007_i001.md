Are These People =razy 
=1span> 
Are these people crazy? This was my initial respo=se when I read the article last week in the Washington Post by Nancy 
Scola — Uber'= not a $40 billion start-up. It's a mid-sized car company — and it is still my b=lief today. In its current 
round of fundraising, Uber was valued at =40 billion dollars raising $1.2 billion that it closed last week and supporters 
are claiming that this eye-popping figur= for a six-year-old ride-on-demand company isn't crazy because they claim that 
Uber8a1=9;s value is based on the bet that it will soon "become a meaningful substitute for people owning cars." 
Baffled</=pan> by this I s=oke with a knowledgeable friend of mine on Wall Street who not only agreed with me but told 
me that Goldman Sachs is telling its people that they are coming back to the market next year for more financing at an 
$80 billion valuation. Are these p=ople drinking Cool-Aid

Uber launched in 2009 in San Francisco as a high-e=d car service. It existed to serve those who wanted, in the words of 
chief executive Travis Kalanick, a "baller&quo=; way of getting around the city. But somewhat by coincidence, that 
luxury service also happened to be a perfect match for how masses of people wanted to travel. Young people in the 
=nited States aren't driving nearly as much as they once did. That has put Uber in a posit=on to suck up some of the 
billions of dollars that people might otherwise pour into cars,=gas and auto insurance. "Uber's strength is that it has 
tappe= the mobility needs of a young generation of a networked people at exactly the moment their demands =re 
changing," says Anthony Townsend, senior research scientist at NYU=#39;s Rudin Center for Transportation. 
In part, Townsend says, that has to do with the =apid rise of powerful, Internet-connected mobile phones. According to 
the Pew Rese=rch Internet Project, about 80 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 own a smartphon=, 
and "they don't want to drive because they want to stare at their screens." Add in that more you=g people in the United 
States are moving into cities, where Uber's distan=e-dependent pricing is less painful than it would be in the suburbs. 
And the reas=ning behind this astronomical valuation of $40 billion is that as long as Uber keeps its customer service 
high and prices within reason, people will find it just as economical and perhaps more enjoyable to use Uber to get 
around than owning a car. With th=t in mind, considering Uber to be worth a mid-sized car company doesn't s=em so 
far-fetched. 
And they claim that there's more. Because they say that Ub=r today isn't just about getting yourself a ride. It's about 
getting your stuff a ride to =ou. In some of the 51 countries around the globe where it operates, Uber is =ggressively 
experimenting with flipping the equation so that cars and drivers are delivering everything fr=m packages to flu shots to 
kitten snuggles. "Thinking of them as a company that transports people from one place to another is one part of the 
story," says Sundararajan, pausing our phone call to get into an arriving Uber vehicle. "But you wouldn't come up with a
