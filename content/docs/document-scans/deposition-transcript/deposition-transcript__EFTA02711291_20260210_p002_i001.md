that gives birth, gives life, while at the same time bringing separation and death. The world is a waste system of the unreal: 
nothing is left but the unreal. Just to name things. 
The death of the world: seethe icy words hail down upon me, the icy meanings, and the world dies too . . . all I know is what 
the words Icnow.fil3
Tired of the old words, the comfort words, bored with the old descriptions. All categories arc pseudo-categories. All 
categories, all concepts arc waste. Magic, myth, religion, art . . . ideology, science, literature: comfort words. There is no 
longer any possibility of objective points of support outside speech or thought. aceMeaning and necessity are preserved only 
in the linguistic practices which embody them.a" 
Thus, no meaning can be ascribed to ficeexisting world.fi It is ficeneither significant nor absurd. It is, quite simply. That is the 
most remarkable thing about it. And suddenly the obviousness of this strikes us with irresistible force. All at once the whole 
splendid construction collapses:V And the world born of the word goes back to the word. 
aceUniverse is not a very large expanding balloon with galactic light bulbs interspersed at varying distances.1 E= MC showed 
that aceUniverse is not a simultaneous assembly of things. Universe isnaTMt even iherea"in fact manaTMs invention of the 
concept reveals his terror crouching behind a facade of omniscience.P Universe: the most comprehensive world 
generalization. Universe isnaTMt there: it simply is. ItaTMs not a thing, or things: it is. ItaTMs not how things are in the world 
that is mystical, but that it exists?? 
We are deprived of our comfort words, our comfortable world. We are denied, everything is denied. Things no longer have 
any meaning. Things no longer exist. There is no longer the possibility of a universe of psychological, social, or functional 
signification. There is no longer the possibility of constructing a new objective world, even though it be more solid, more 
immediate. There is no longer the possibility of a single world, a whole world, a unified world. 
The unity is unitless: man is dead. This is a terrifying concept for man to contemplate. Absolutely terrifying. We have tried to 
force reality into a framework of space and time just as the ancients tried to place reality within a framework of emotions. It 
doesnatMt work. Witness the image of the earth as seen from the moon: night and day at the same time: all times all the time: 
no matter what the time. Times have changed. 
accEveryone talks about the Earth being round but does anyone actually believe it? Nature of roundness is that you eventually 
get back to the same placernowhere to goa"no infinity. Not condensation, but condensation of mind. We are all living 
through one of our most terrifying dream horror fantasies: WeaTMIC locked in a room, and the walls and ceilings are closing in 
on us. All the things weirmve been raised to worshipa"manaTMs limitless power, the ever-giving nature of mother eartha"all 
these infinite possibilities are beginning to seem less infinite. In fact, the infinite horizon is heading this way fastlim 
We caning even continue to talk of Earth: the place: a physical clump of dirt spinning around outer space: outside what. The 
world still goes spinning around, but itaTMs in my head. ItaTMs happening in my head. I do it all in my head. ItaTMs a finite 
world of words: ficewhere is this world . . . and what do I know of it? Where do I seize it? Where do I believe it? Where do I 
surrender myself to it entirely? Here! Or nowhere.1119
