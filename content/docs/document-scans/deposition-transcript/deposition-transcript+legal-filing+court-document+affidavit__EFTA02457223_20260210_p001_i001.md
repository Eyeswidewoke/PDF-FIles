Very interesting experiment. It mig=t tell us a lot about musical genres and their underlying structure, and t=e 
cognitive capacities that organize thought, creativity, and experience i= these apparently human-specific ways. 
On blind children, you=might want to look at the fascinating study by Landau and Gleitman on the =anguage of 
the blind: Language and Experience: evidence from blind chil=ren (or something like that). What is striking is that 
without v=sual experience, the blind learn language virtually in parallel with sight=d children, with the same changes 
that plainly have to do with maturation =nd the very specific internal concepts of human cognition, leading finally=to 
understanding of extremely refined visual concepts, all with only minim=l experience that can't be directing these 
developments any more than =he nutrition of the embryo, while obviously necessary for development, can=determine 
that we have a mammalian rather than visual system. There =re also some quite intriguing differences. E.g., at the age 
when sig=ted children acquire the words/concepts see, look at, etc., blind crildren also do, but necessarily give a tactile 
rather than visual interpre=ation. So for the blind child, to look at something is to touch it, =nd to see it is to grasp what 
it is. The child is therefore surprise= to find that its mother cannot see the back of the dolls they are holding= since the 
child can. Lots of results like these. 
What =s particularly striking, however, is how similar the cognitive growth is t= normal physical growth, of 
course elicited by experience but then substan=ially following its internally determined path. The widely-held beli=f that 
cognitive development is somehow different from the rest of biology=in that it is experience-determined is, I think, a 
residue of traditional =ualism -- a kind of "methodological dualism," which is, I think,=more pernicious than traditional 
metaphysical dualism, which, in fact, was=quite serious and reasonable science at the time.
