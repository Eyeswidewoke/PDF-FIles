trade, and technology. According to the article, the FBI currently has multiple open investigations into elite Chinese 
hacking teams, which U.S. officials describe as the greatest state-backed cyber threat to American interests. The 
article further detailed that another major firm, Wiley Rein, was also targeted earlier this year, and that 
cybersecurity experts at Mandiant and Volexity said law firms are especially vulnerable because they manage 
sensitive and high-stakes information tied to major corporations and government policy. The article noted that 
China's embassy denied involvement, reiterating that Beijing "opposes all forms of cyberattacks and cybercrime," 
while U.S. investigators continue probing the campaign's scope and impact. Reuters (10/07, Ward) and the New 
York Times (10/07, Schmidt) also reported on the story. 
DNI Tulsi Gabbard Orders US Intel Agency Leaders to Stem Leaks 
CBS News (10/07, LaPorta) reported that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard issued a memo ordering 
U.S. intelligence agencies to assess the feasibility of random polygraph exams for employees and contractors, 
emphasizing questions about leaking classified information to the press. According to the article, an ODNI official 
said the review was prompted by findings that a lack of polygraph testing had emboldened some former 
intelligence officials to spy for U.S. adversaries, while Gabbard's spokesperson cited recent unauthorized 
disclosures that could "damage U.S. strategic alliances and credibility." The article noted that both the Obama and 
Bush administrations faced criticism for using FBI investigations and the Espionage Act to target leaks and 
prosecute officials, and that Gabbard's directive has revived similar concerns about press freedom, whistleblower 
protections, and the potential chilling effect on national security reporting.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
FBI 'Summer Heat' Arrests Include 'Most Wanted' Fugitives, Gang Members 
The Center Square (10/07, Blankley) reported that the FBI and its law enforcement partners carried out "Operation 
Summer Heat," a three-month national initiative that led to 8,629 arrests targeting violent crime, fugitives, and 
gang members across all 55 FBI field offices. The operation prioritized ten major cities, including Boston, San Diego, 
Dallas, and Jacksonville, resulting in over 750 fugitive arrests, more than 30 of them wanted for murder, as well as 
the capture of several individuals on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. According to the article, FBI San Diego agents 
arrested 76 people—including a fugitive from Mexico accused of trafficking methamphetamine, fentanyl, and 
cocaine—and recovered missing children from sexual exploitation cases, while FBI Jacksonville agents arrested 120 
suspects, including Mongols motorcycle gang members and two people charged with distributing child sexual 
abuse material. FBI Dallas agents arrested high-profile fugitives Cindy Rodriguez Singh and Cesar Pascual Orozco, 
extraditing them from India and Mexico, and seized fentanyl, firearms, and child exploitation evidence, while FBI 
Boston agents made 404 arrests and recovered 27 missing children in New England operations targeting local gangs 
and drug trafficking. The article noted that, in total, the FBI seized nearly 45,000 kilograms of cocaine, 421 
kilograms of fentanyl, more than 2,200 weapons, and located over 1,000 child victims, underscoring what the 
bureau called a "whole-of-nation" crackdown on violent and transnational criminal activity. WBTS (NBC-1m (10/07, 
Margain, Fortier) quoted Ted Docks, special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston Division: "Operation Summer Heat 
is a snapshot of what our agents, task force officers, and analysts do daily to target, apprehend, and bring to justice 
the most dangerous, violent criminals wreaking havoc in our communities. We could not have done this without 
the strong partnerships we have with our state and local law enforcement agencies. Rest assured, while summer is 
behind us, your FBI is not letting up." The article also quoted Kimberly Milka, Assistant Supervisory Special Agent at 
the FBI's Boston office: "The majority of our targets were individuals who were just problematic to local 
communities." KMGH (ABC-7) (10/07, Garrison) quoted a statement from Special Agent in Charge of FBI Denver 
Mark Michalek: "The FBI Denver Field Office is fully committed to crushing violent crime across Colorado and 
Wyoming. Operation Summer Heat shows that surging resources with our state and local law enforcement 
partners, as well as our other federal partners, can have a significant impact on reducing crime." Hoodline (10/07, 
Jenkins) quoted Special Agent in Charge Mark Dargis "The results of the FBI's Summer Heat operations are proof 
that surging resources with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners can, and did, make a significant 
impact on violent crime in our region." Additional reporting on the story was provided by KDVR (Fox-31) (10/07, 
Jewett), KSNV (NBC-3) (10/07, Cruz), Patch (10/07, Hosey) (2), and WBMA (ABC-33/40) (10/07, LeBerte).
