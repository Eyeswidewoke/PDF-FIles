On January 5, 2006, I attempted to meet with Alfredo Rodriguez to 
recover the folder or journal in which he kept the notes that were 
given to him during his employ with Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. He kept this 
folder to justify what he did during his employ should the need arise 
to justify what occurred with the monies he had to keep or any 
questions as to the petty cash he withdrew from the household account 
from the bank. At approximately 10:00 pm, I attempted contact with 
Mr. Rodriguez and discovered he was assisting his wife at her place of 
employment and would not be able to meet with me. Mr. Rodriguez 
stated he would meet with me on January 6, 2006, in Broward County, in 
the morning hours. 
On January 6, 2006, at approximately 9:00 am, I received a telephone 
call from Mr. Rodriguez who advised he had the file in hand and would
