FBI Daily News Briefing 
Dailyfly (08/25, Staff Writer) reported that Kevin Lee Towner, a 61-year-old man from Selah, has been sentenced to 
5 years in federal prison for possessing child pornography. Towner pleaded guilty after investigators found over

Childhood, a nationwide Department of Justice program aimed at combating child sexual exploitation and abuse. In 
the press release, W. Mike Herrington, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Seattle field office, stated, "Child sexual 
abuse material is extremely damaging to young people, especially because it is often repeatedly shared and can be 
nearly impossible to remove from the Internet. Mr. Towner was found to possess not just some but thousands of 
these graphic images, including of very young children, and he will now face the consequences of that conduct. 
The FBI is committed to protecting child victims by holding these kinds of predators accountable and showing them 
they cannot hide their illegal online activity."
