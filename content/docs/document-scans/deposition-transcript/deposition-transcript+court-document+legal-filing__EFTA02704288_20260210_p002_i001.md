Also, locate your joke(s) in the present tense. It gives the joke an immediacy=and makes it more exciting. It's very 
subtle, I know, but true and abs=lutely necessary. And every little bit helps you. Read or listen to any of my ver=ions of 
jokes. It's always, "The barber says," never,="The barber said." 
And Remem=er 
Though sometimes you really can't dodge them, do your best=to not include any words from the punch line in the 
body of your joke. It just makes the=punch line more fun. 
You can scoot through most of the body of a longer joke, but always make sure=you're speaking slowly and clearly 
when you're giving information that*=804os especially pertinent to the outcome. 
And, very important, memorize the punch line. Know it well. Even say it out lou= a few times so you can deliver it 
flawlessly with confidence and without stammering. 
Obviously, after you've gotten your version of a joke together, you'l= never have to think about these things again. But 
use these guidelines when recalling a joke=someone told you before you re-tell it. 
Five to=20 Remember 
To remember jokes you want to tell in a series, make up a silly connector lin= or scenario involving the punch line of 
a joke and the beginning of the next=one. The more absurd the connector line or the connecting scenario, the easier=it'll 
be to remember. 
Here are five great jokes, with a short idea between each pair to aid you in remembering them in that order. The 
connector(s) can be longer, even a who=e silly scenario that links the two. After you catch on, pick five jokes tha= you 
love to tell and create your little silly in-between tales. You'll=be shocked how well it works. And how you'll never forget 
your dopey little=connectors. All you need to get started is to remember how to get started. Well, I40=99d say if you 
can't even remember the first joke, you should kill yourself. How=should you do it? Go buy some cyanide. 
A woman walks into a drug store and says to the pharmacist, "14)=99d like to buy some cyanide. I need it to poison 
my husband." 
The pharmacist says, "Don't be ridiculous. I can't giv= you cyanide to kill your husband. You'll go to jail, I'll go to jail, 
you'r= crazy." 
The woman reaches into her purse and hands the pharmacist a picture of her hus=and in bed with the pharmacist's 
wife. 
The pharmacist says, "You didn't tell me you had a prescriptio=." 
(the woman has two prescriptions in her hand: One for cyanide, and one for cond=ms ...) 
A couple has sex, and when they're finished, the woman looks in the=box of condoms and sees only six left out of 
twelve. 
She says, "What happened to the other five condoms?" 
He says, "I, uh, made balloon animals out of them for my niece.4)=9D 
That night she tells a male friend what happened, and says, "Have you=ever done that?" 
He says, "Of course. All the time." 
She says, "Really? You've made balloon animals out of condoms?=E24,*
