Subject: Re: 
more open, ?? NOT one real indication of that expression. its mere words. coming from you -
words „ no action, you have gone back to being a dental assistant„the exact same as when you 
arrived, WHAT CHANGE WHAT openess, its all words what i hear over and over from you, 
don't accept , they are wrong, don't feel good. these are the same as me saying to the boy in the 
road get out of the way„ he repsonds . i dont accept it, i think it is wrong, it doesn't feel right. , 
my parent s think , my friends think, people in my country think, where is the openess, the 
desire to learn , the recognition that change is important , the doing. the action, the behavior. I 
am aware you are grateful, and it is not a lack of thank yous" at all that i am focused on.. it is 
you refuse to actually take your life , make changes to avoid bad things. but continue to say 
"open" but act only closed. I love spending time with you, but your stubborness in refusing to 
get out of your own way is too disturbing to watch up close. I am there ,in the future gladly 
when you make real change.. not "decide to" but actually do something. With very warm regards 
and only good wishes.. JEffrey

Jeffrey, when I said 'liar' it was a joke according to that very moment, I thought you knew 
that. I don't know how many times I told you 'thank you' and how much I appreciate your 
help, but may be it was not enough then, if you don't feel that I'm really greatful to you, and it 
makes me feel bad.. I understand if you are tired to hear things, which can be so natural to 
you, but are not to me, I agree that some of them doesn't really make sence and I simply have 
to be more open, and there are also certain things which Pd not accept. and not because I think 
they arc wrong in general, but to Mtamifirally they slop:anal good. Anyway Jeffrey, it's sad 
to me that you don't want to see me anymore,because I enjoyed spending time with you, but if 
it's now difficult to you, I understand. Thank you for everything.

you , yourself ,said you saw little reason , if , after doing your best to get the kid out of the 
way of the car. there was nothing that you could do, you would not want to 
watch as the car ( "reality," in your instance ) slammed into her. Instead of a 
"thank you for helping my friend katya" , I am told " You are a liar'! you make 
me feel weird " I find that impolite, "I do not appreciate that", " but my parents 
think x, but my friends think y . However, ---- I will gladly continue to help with 
skin , as after 4- 5 months no matter how stubborn and entrenched in self 
destructive ideas you are. the results will be clear,and incontrovertible and 
though you might tell me that your parents grew up with acne , and your 
grandmothers entire generation suffered from acne and they think its ok.-- , that 
you, were able to finally do something that they could never imagine„
