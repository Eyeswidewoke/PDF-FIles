Important Changes To Your Account 
We are making changes to your Card account and benefits. A summary of the changes appears below. The 
detailed changes to your Cardmember Agreement and the relevant program terms can be found after the 
summary chart. 
Summary of Changes 
Pay Over Time 
limit on Pay 
Over Time 
features 
You may have the ability to carry a balance on your Card using a Pay Over Time feature (for 
example, Extended Payment Option). We are clarifying that we may increase or reduce the 
maximum Pay Over Time balance that you may have on your account. This amount is called Pay 
Over Time limit. Your Pay Over Time limit is $35,000. We will tell you if we change it. 
Remember, you must pay in full all charges that would cause your Pay Over Time balance to 
exceed your Pay Over Time limit. 
Application of 
Payments 
Effective with billing periods starting on or after May 3, 2013, we are changing how we apply 
payments on accounts with a Pay Over Time balance. If you have a Pay Over Time Balance, 
your statement will show a Minimum Payment Due. After this change, we will apply any amounts 
paid above your Minimum Payment Due to your highest interest rate balances first. Prior to this 
change, amounts paid above your Minimum Payment Due were applied to the lowest interest rate 
balances first and then to higher rate balances. We will continue to apply amounts paid up to the 
Minimum Payment Due to the lowest interest rate balances first. 
Late Payment 
Fee 
Effective June 1, 2013, we are changing how we calculate Late Payment fees. As a result of this 
change, the 2.99% Late Payment fee will apply only to the past due Pay In Full balance. Prior to 
this change, that fee also applied to the past due Pay Over Time Minimum Due. 
Credit Reports 
Effective immediately, we are modifying the language concerning credit reports in your 
Cardmember Agreement to clarify that you agree that we will obtain credit reports about you and 
that we will use them for any purpose, subject to applicable law. 
New OPEN 
Saving? 
Benefit Option 
If you are enrolled in the Membership Rewards' program, you now have the option of receiving 
your OPEN Savings benefit as discounts (provided as statement credits) or as additional 
Membership Rewards points. You can make your selection by going to opensavings.com or by 
calling the number on the back of your Card. If you do not make a selection, your OPEN Savings 
benefit will remain the same as when your account was opened. 
OPEN 
Savings' 
Merchant 
Changes 
Effective July 1, 2013, Courtyard by Marriott', SpringHill Suites by Marriott . Fairfield Inn & Suites 
by Marriott', Residence Inn by Marriott', and TownePlace Suites by Marriott will no longer be 
part of the OPEN Savings benefit. Any amounts that are charged to your Card account by these 
properties on or after July 1 will not be eligible for the OPEN Savings benefit. Since your Card 
account is normally charged at the end of your stay, that means that you will not receive the 
OPEN Savings benefit for any stays completed on or after July 1. 
Effective May 16, 2013, Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp will no longer be part of the OPEN 
Savings benefit. My amounts that are charged to your Card account by this merchant on or after 
this date, will not be eligible for the OPEN Savings benefit. 
Effective May 16, 2013, Microsoft Store will no longer be part of the OPEN Savings benefit. My 
amounts that are charged to your Card account by this merchant on or after this date will not be 
eligible for the OPEN Savings benefit. 
This is an additional reminder that, effective September 1. 2012, Iron Mountain was removed as 
part of the OPEN Savings benefit. My amounts charged to your Card account by this merchant 
or after this date. are not eligible for the OPEN Savings benefit.
