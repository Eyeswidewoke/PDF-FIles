HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
policies and procedures may change from time to time and may differ materially from those 
described below and exceptions from the methodology set forth below may occur from 
time to time as determined by Hudson Bay Capital. 
Hudson Bay Capital will allocate each Multi-Fund expense among the Funds that should 
bear the applicable expense (the "Applicable Funds") pro rata generally using one of the 
following metrics: (i) assets under management; (ii) number of transactions; (iii) number 
of active positions; (iv) number of lifetime positions; and (v) such other metric(s) as may 
be applicable in the discretion of Hudson Bay Capital (each a "Fund Allocation Metric"). 
Hudson Bay Capital will select the Fund Allocation Metric and the Funds that are 
Applicable Funds for each Multi-Fund Expense in a manner that jt believes to be fair and 
reasonable based upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the Multi-Fund Expense 
at issue. For example, direct investment expenses generally will be allocated based upon 
an Applicable Fund's respective participations in the relevant investments. Hudson Bay 
Capital may, from time to time, change the Fund Allocation Metric utilized for a Multi-
Fund Expense, and the Funds that are Applicable Funds for a particular Multi-Fund 
Expense, based upon new circumstances and/or considerations and/or create new Fund 
Allocation Metrics as Hudson Bay Capital deems appropriate. 
Consultants 
Certain services provided to the Funds at their expense by consultants and other 
independent contractors could, theoretically, otherwise be provided by an employee that 
Hudson Bay Capital would hire at its expense. While Hudson Bay Capital may be subject 
to a conflict in terms of deciding whether to retain a consultant or hire an employee to 
perform a task, there may be valid business reasons for a consultant to be hired (e.g., the 
limited nature of the task or the particular expertise or preference of the consultant). 
Item 6. 
Performance-Based Fees and Side-by-Side Management 
As stated in "Item 5 — Fees and Compensation" above, generally all Hudson Bay Capital 
Clients are subject to payment of a performance-based fee. As a result, Hudson Bay 
Capital does not face the conflicts of interest that may arise when an investment adviser 
accepts performance-based fees from some clients, but not others. However, to the extent 
performance-based fees paid by Clients vary, Hudson Bay Capital may have an incentive 
to favor one Client over another. Hudson Bay Capital addresses this possible conflict 
through its trade allocation policy, in which investment opportunities are allocated among 
Clients according to each Client's investment objectives and what it believes to be in a 
fair and equitable manner. 
Item 7. 
Types of Clients 
As described in "Item 4 - Advisory Business" above, Hudson Bay Capital provides 
investment advice to private investment vehicles (defined previously as the "Funds"). 
Each of the Funds is excluded from the definition of "investment company" pursuant to 
Section 3(cX7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Hudson Bay 
Capital provides investment advice directly to the Funds and not individually to the Fund
