=font color="#000000">Despite being the highest-paid black performer of t=e era, Robinson died penniless in 1949, and 
his funeral was paid for by longtime friend Ed Sullivan. Robinson is remembered for the support he gave to=fellow 
performers, including Fred Astaire, Lena Home, Jesse Owens, and the Nichol=s brothers. Both Sammy Davis, Jr. and Ann 
Miller credit him as a teacher and mentor, and Miller credits him with havi=g "changed the course of my life." Gregory 
Hines pr=duced and starred in a biographical movie about Robinson for which he won the NAACP Best actor 
Award.4>=A0 In 1989, the U.S. Congress designated May 25, Robinson's birthday, as National Tap Dance Day. 
Robinson was born in Richmond, Virginia an= raised in its Jackson Ward neighborhood. His parents were Maxwell, a 
machine-shop worker,=and Maria Robinson, a choir singer. His grandmother raised him after both parents died in 1885 
when he was 7 years =Id — his father from chronic heart disease and his mother from natural causes. Details of 
Robinson's early life are known only through legend, much of it perpetuated by Robinson himself. =e claimed he was 
christened "Luther" — a name he did not like. He suggested to his younger brother Bill that they should exchange 
names. Eventual=y, the exchange between the names of both brothers was made. The brother subsequently adopted 
the name of "Percy" and under that name achieved recognition as a musician. 
Although Robinson was successful desp=te the obstacle of racism one of his favorite anecdotes was that one day he 
seated himself in = restaurant and a customer objected to his presence. When the manager sugges=ed that it might be 
better if Robinson leave, he smiled and asked, "Ha=e you got a ten dollar bill?" Politely asking to borrow the=manager's 
note for a moment, Robinson added six $10 bills from his own wallet and mixed th=m up, then extended the seven bills 
together, adding, "Here, let'= see you pick out the colored one". The restaurant manager =erved Robinson without 
further delay. 
Despite earning and spending a fortune, his memories of surviving the streets as a child never left him, prompting many 
acts of generosity. In 1933, while in his hometown of Richmond, he saw two children caught between the heat of traffi= 
to retrieve their ball. There was no stoplight at the intersection: Robinson w=nt to the city and provided the money to 
have one installed. In 1973, a =tatue of "Bojangles", sculpted by Jack Witt, at the intersection of Adams and West Leigh 
Streets.=was established in a small park at the intersection. 
Bojangles co-founded the =ew York Black Yankees baseball team in Harlem in 1936 with financier James "Soldier Boy" 
Semler. The team was a successful member of the Negro National League until it disbanded in 1948, after Major League 
Baseball was desegregated. In 1989, a joint U.S. Senate/House resolution declared "National Tap Dance Day&qu=t; to 
be May 25, the anniversary of Bill Robinson's birth. Robinson was in=ucted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & 
Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt=Whitney Hall of Fame in 1987. Bill "Bojangles" Robinson like to say that he could run 
bac=ward faster than most men could go forward. Whether or not this is true is unimportant because the both raise the 
bar and broke do=n the racial barriers making the world the better place which is all that we should ever ask.
