These acts and edicts sound farcical, yes, but no more so than the actual=events in Washington, circa 2008. We already 
have been served up the $700=billion "Emergency Economic Stabilization Act" and the "Auto Industry Fin=ncing and 
Restructuring Act." Now that Barack Obama is in town, he will=soon sign into law with great urgency the "American 
Recovery and Reinvest=ent Plan." This latest Hail Mary pass will increase the federal budget (w=ich has already 
expanded by $1.5 trillion in eight years under George Bus=) by an additional $1 trillion -- in roughly his first 100 days in 
office= The current economic strategy is right out of "Atlas Shrugged": The more=incompetent you are in business, the 
more handouts the politicians will=bestow on you. That's the justification for the $2 trillion of subsidies=doled out 
already to keep afloat distressed insurance companies, banks, Wall Street investment houses, and auto companies --
while standing next=in line for their share of the booty are real-estate developers, the stee= industry, chemical 
companies, airlines, ethanol producers, construction=firms and even catfish farmers. With each successive bailout to 
"calm the=markets," another trillion of national wealth is subsequently lost. Yet,=as "Atlas" grimly foretold, we now 
treat the incompetent who wreck their=companies as victims, while those resourceful business owners who manage=to 
make a profit are portrayed as recipients of illegitimate "windfalls." 
When Rand was writing in the 1950s, one of the pillars of American industral might was the railroads. In her novel the 
railroad owner, Dagny Taggar=, an enterprising industrialist, has a FedEx-like vision for expansion an= first-rate service 
by rail. But she is continuously badgered, cajoled,=taxed, ruled and regulated -- always in the public interest -- into 
bankr=ptcy. Sound far-fetched? On the day I sat down to write this ode to "Atla=," a Wall Street Journal headline blared: 
"Rail Shippers Ask Congress to=Regulate Freight Prices." 
In one chapter of the book, an entrepreneur invents a new miracle metal --=stronger but lighter than steel. The 
government immediately appropriates=the invention in "the public good." The politicians demand that the 
metal=inventor come to Washington and sign over ownership of his invention or=lose everything. 
The scene is eerily similar to an event late last year when six bank presi=ents were summoned by Treasury Secretary 
Hank Paulson to Washington, and=then shuttled into a conference room and told, in effect, that they could=not leave 
until they collectively signed a document handing over percenta=es of their future profits to the government. The 
Treasury folks insisted=that this shakedown, too, was all in "the public interest." 
Ultimately, "Atlas Shrugged" is a celebration of the entrepreneur, the ris= taker and the cultivator of wealth through 
human intellect. Critics dism=ssed the novel as simple-minded, and even some of Rand's political admire=s complained 
that she lacked compassion. Yet one pertinent warning resoun=s throughout the book: When profits and wealth and 
creativity are denigra=ed in society, they start to disappear -- leaving everyone the poorer. 
One memorable moment in "Atlas" occurs near the very end, when the economy=has been rendered comatose by all 
the great economic minds in Washington.=F inally, and out of desperation, the politicians come to the heroic 
busin=ssman John Galt (who has resisted their assault on capitalism) and beg hi= to help them get the economy back on 
track. The discussion sounds much=like what would happen today: 
Galt: "You want me to be Economic Dictator?" 
Mr. Thompson: "Yes!" 
"And you'll obey any order I give?" 
"Implicitly!" 
"Then start by abolishing all income taxes." 
"Oh no!" screamed Mr. Thompson, leaping to his feet. "We couldn't do that=... How would we pay government 
employees?" 
"Fire your government employees." 
"Oh, no!" 
Abolishing the income tax. Now that really would be a genuine economic sti=ulus. But Mr. Obama and the Democrats in 
Washington want to do the opposi=e: to raise the income tax "for purposes of fairness" as Barack Obama put= it. 
David Kelley, the president of the Atlas Society, which is dedicated to pr=moting Rand's ideas, explains that "the older 
the book gets, the more tim=ly its message." He tells me that there are plans to make "Atlas Shrugged= into a major 
motion picture -- it is the only classic novel of recent de=ades that was never made into a movie. "We don't need to 
make a movie out=of the book," Mr. Kelley jokes. "We are living it right now."
