He faced a maximum of 15 years and was given 18 months. In court Friday, Edwards told U.S. District 
Judge Kenneth Marra the plea agreement "was worked out behind the victims' backs." Edwards said 
that part of the confidential agreement was that the federal government would not prosecute Epstein 
for abusing more victims if he pleaded guilty to abusing one in state court. 
"The agreement was that he could plead guilty to abusing one girl in state court so that he wouldn't be 
prosecuted in federal court for the 100 other girls he molested," Edwards told Marra. 
The two girls, identified in court papers as Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, did not testify on Friday. 
Epstein's attorneys were not present at the hearing which involved federal prosecutors. Edwards 
invoked a federal crime victims law to raise the issue in federal court, where he wanted Marra to kill the 
plea agreement. Under the law, victims have a right to confer and Edwards said they were not consulted 
about the agreement. Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee argued that the federal court did not have 
jurisdiction and Marra agreed. Epstein's attorney, Jack Goldberger, could not be reached for comment. 
Edwards said that one of his underage clients started visiting Epstein at his sprawling mansion on El 
Brillo Way when she was 13 to give him massages for $200. Police reports have said that the girls would 
be escorted to a bedroom with a massage table and that Epstein would enter wearing only a towel and 
instruct the girls to remove their clothing and massage him. These sessions escalated into touching and 
other activities, sometimes with sex toys. Edwards said that when his client turned 14, Epstein told her 
that she could make $200 for every girl she recruited for the massage sessions. She claimed she 
recruited 50. 
In court, Edwards told Marra: "Mr. Epstein is a billionaire who has sexually abused dozens and dozens of 
13- to 17-year-old girls. And because of his deviant appetites and his vast wealth, he might just be the 
most dangerous sexual predator in the world." 
Based on the above article, on July 15, 2008, I contacted Atty. Brad Edwards. Atty. Edwards explained 
he was going to contact me reference his clients. His clients have claimed that they are victims of sexual 
abuse. They allege that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused them and approximately fifty (50) others 
underage girls. Edwards explained he would reach out to the clients and schedule appointments for 
interviews. I provided Edwards with my telephone numbers and advised to call me when he is available. 
I informed him I would contact MA Belohlavek to ascertain if the plea negotiations which occurred on 
June 30, 2008, covered only the listed victims in the State v. Jeffrey Epstein case. Edwards assured me 
that his clients were not previously interviewed by our agency during the previous investigation. I 
telephoned the State Attorney's Office and left messages for MA Belohlavek to call me.
