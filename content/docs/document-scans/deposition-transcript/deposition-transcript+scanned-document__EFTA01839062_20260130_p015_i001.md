previous rape by soldiers in Guinea. She had been so convincing that she brought tears to the eyes 
of one of the prosecutors. 
After hearing the testimony of Diallo, the Grand Jury indicted DSK on May 18th. It charged 
him with two counts of criminal sexual acts, one count of attempted rape, two counts of sexual 
abuse, one count of unlawful imprisonment, one count of forcible touching. 
For his part, DSK pleaded not guilty to all the charges. He was then granted bail on conditions 
tantamount to house arrest. The case meanwhile was adjourned to July 181", 2011. 
In the interim, the prosecutors continued to subpoena records, including cell phone 
transmissions, credit card records, and CCTV tapes. However, as they gathered this evidence, the 
case became, as one person in the prosecutor's office, "curioser and curioser." On June 7th, 
Diallo's lawyer, Ken Thompson, who was a former prosecutor himself, delivered an unexpected 
bombshell. He told the prosecutors that his client had been untruthful in her interviews with the 
prosecutors in describing her background and circumstances. Specifically, he said that she had 
fabricated the story she had told them about her being raped by soldiers in Guinea. While she had 
not told this story under oath, and it had no bearing on the DSK case, it stunned the prosecutors. 
Among other things, it meant that she could provide a convincing description of a sexual 
encounter that she had invented. But why would she have been untruthful about such an 
embarrassing event? It was initially suggested that she had told this false account to support a 
similar account she had used in her immigration application. But when prosecutors then 
examined her immigration records, they found she had told no such story. When re-interviewed 
on June 8th, Diallo admitted the prior rape story was untrue. 
Then prosecutors found that she told a far more damaging untruth since it was about the DSK 
case itself. Diallo testified to the Grand Jury that immediately after she had been assaulted she 
fled the room and went to the far end of the 28i6 floor hallway. This was the story she had also 
told to police and prosecutors. When she was asked why she had not used her pass key to go into 
another room from which she could call for help, she said they all had "Do Not Disturb" signs on 
the door. But when the prosecutors obtained the electronic key records from the Sofitel hotel for 
the rooms on the 28th floor, which was not until late June, they showed that Diallo had entered 
another room, 2820. If so, she had been untruthful under oath about her whereabouts before her 
outcry. The prosecutors could not immediately re-interview her because for more than a week in 
June she refused to speak further to them, claiming she was ill. Finally, on June 281h, Diallo 
admitted that she had been untruthful about not going into 2820. She now said that she went 
directly into 2820 after running out of the presidential suite, and she then spent considerable time 
cleaning and vacuuming the room. This version would explain where she had been between 
12:13 PM and 12:30 PM (when she met the other maid). The problem here is that the key records 
show that she did not use her key to enter room 2820 until 12:26 PM, thirteen minutes after the 
encounter. When confronted with this discrepancy, one month later she changed her story yet 
again. On July 27th, in what the prosecutors describe as "version 3," she says she waited in the 
hallway for most of that time. Then, when she saw DSK leave the presidential suite, which was at 
12:26 PM, she entered 2820 to pick up her cleaning equipment, which she had left there earlier. 
And she then went back to the now empty presidential suite. 
The prosecutors now had to contend with the fact that not only had she been untruthful under 
oath to the Grand Jury about this case, but she had concealed her visit to room 2820 from the 
police which had effectively obstructed the investigation. The prosecutors noted that if she had 
mentioned her visits to 2820, it would have been declared part of the crime scene and searched for
