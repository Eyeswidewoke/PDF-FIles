JUNE 4, 2012 - We'r= not done with the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran. Given that th= current round of 
negotiations with the world's major powers will not fund=mentally change Iran's nuclear program, the question of an 
Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is likely t= return to center stage later this year. In addition to hard-headed 
diplom=cy and economic sanctions, there is an important step the United States ca= take to change Israel's calculations -
- helping the people of Syria in their battle against President Bashar al=Assad's regime. Iran's nuclear program and 
Syria's civil war may seem unco=nected, but in fact they are inextricably linked. Israel's real fear -- lo=ing its nuclear 
monopoly and therefore the ability to use its conventional forces at will throughout the Middle E=st -- is the 
unacknowledged factor driving its decision-making toward the =slamic Republic. For Israeli leaders, the real threat from 
a nuclear-armed=lran is not the prospect of an insane Iranian leader launching an unprovoked nuclear attack on Israel 
tha= would lead to the annihilation of both countries. It's the fact that Iran=doesn't even need to test a nuclear weapon 
to undermine Israeli military l=verage in Lebanon and Syria. Just reaching the nuclear threshold could embolden Iranian 
leaders to call on t=eir proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, to attack Israel, knowing that their adve=sary would have to think 
hard before striking back. 
That is where Syria=comes in. It is the strategic relationship between the Islamic Republic an= the Assad regime that 
makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel's se=urity. Over the three decades of hostility between Iran and Israel, a 
direct military confrontation has never occurre= -- but through Hezbollah, which is sustained and trained by Iran via 
Syri=, the Islamic Republic has proven able to threaten Israeli security intere=ts. 
The collapse of the=Assad regime would sunder this dangerous alliance. Defense Minister Ehud B=rak, arguably the most 
important Israeli decision-maker on this question, =ecently told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the Assad regime's fall 
"will be a major blow to the radical axi=, major blow to Iran.... It's the only kind of outpost of the Iranian infl=ence in the 
Arab world ... and it will weaken dramatically both Hezbollah =n Lebanon and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza." 
The rebellion in Sy=ia has now lasted more than a year. The opposition is not going away, and =t is abundantly clear that 
neither diplomatic pressure nor economic sancti=ns will force Assad to accept a negotiated solution to the crisis. With 
his life, his family, and his clan's future a= stake, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator's =tance. 
Absent foreign intervention, then, the civil war in Syria will only=get worse as radicals rush in to exploit the chaos there 
and the spillover into Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey=intensifies. 
U.S. President Bara=k Obama's administration has been understandably wary of engaging in an ai= operation in Syria 
similar to the campaign in Libya, for three main reaso=s. Unlike the Libyan opposition forces, the Syrian rebels are not 
unified and do not hold territory. The Arab=League has not called for outside military intervention as it did in Libya= And 
the Russians, the longtime patron of the Assad regime, are staunchly =pposed. 
Libya was an easier=case. But other than the laudable result of saving many thousands of Libya= civilians from 
Muammar al-Qaddafi's regime, it had no long-lasting conseq=ences for the region. Syria is harder -- but success there 
would be a transformative event for the Middle East. =ot only would another ruthless dictator succumb to mass popular 
opposition= but Iran would no longer have a Mediterranean foothold from which to thre=ten Israel and destabilize the 
region. 
A successful interv=ntion in Syria would require substantial diplomatic and military leadershi= from the United States. 
Washington should start by declaring its willingn=ss to work with regional allies like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey to 
organize, train, and arm Syrian rebel f=rces. The announcement of such a decision would, by itself, likely cause 
s=bstantial defections from the Syrian military. Then, using territory in Tu=key and possibly Jordan, U.S. diplomats and 
Pentagon officials could start strengthening and unifying the oppositi=n. Once the opposition knows real outside help is 
on the way, it should be=possible over time to build a coherent political leadership based on the S=rian National Council 
as well as a manageable command and control structure for the Free Syrian Army, both =f which are now weak and 
divided. This will be difficult and time-consumin=, but we should remember that the Syrian civil war is now destined to 
go o= for years, whether the outside world intervenes or not.
