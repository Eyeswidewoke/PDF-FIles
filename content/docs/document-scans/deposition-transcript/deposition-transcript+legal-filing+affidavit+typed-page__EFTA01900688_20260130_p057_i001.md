Court's subject matter jurisdiction. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(bX1). The defendants, sued in their official 
capacities, challenge this Court's subject matter jurisdiction immunity. over them, invoking the 
doctrine of sovereign The burden of proof for a Rule 12(bX1) motion to dismiss is on the party 
asserting jurisdiction. States, 281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir. 2001). Ramming v. United The Court 
may find a plausible set of facts to support subject matter jurisdiction by considering any of the 
following: "(1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts 
evidenced in the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court's 
resolution of disputed facts." Barrera-Montenegro v. United States, 74 F.3d 657, 659 (5th Cir. 
1996). B. The defendants also seek dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(bX6). The 
standard of review applicable to motions Rule to dismiss under 12(b)(1) is similar to that 
applicable to motions to dismiss under Rule 12(bX6). See Williams v. Wynne, 533 F.3d 360, 364-
65 n.2 (5th Cir. 2008Xobserving that the Rule 12(bX1) and Rule 12(b)(6) standards are similar, 
but noting that applying the Rule 12(6)(1) standard permits the Court to consider a broader 
range of materials in resolving the motion). 10 Rule 12(6)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure allows a party to move for dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim upon 
which relief can be granted. Such a motion is rarely granted because it is viewed with disfavor. 
See Lowrey v. Tex. A & M Univ. Sys., 117 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir. 1997) (quoting Kaiser 
Aluminum & Chem. Sales, Inc. v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 677 F.2d 1045, 1050 (5th Cir. 
1982)). In considering a Rule 12(bX6) motion, the Court "accepts 'all well-pleaded facts as true, 
viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff' See Martin K. Eby Constr. Co. v. 
Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464 (5th Cir. 2004) (quoting Jones v. Greninger, 188 F.3d 
322, 324 (5th Cir. 1999)). But, in deciding whether dismissal is warranted, the Court will not 
accept conclusory allegations in the complaint as true. Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Sales, Inc. v. 
Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 677 F.2d 1045, 1050 (5th Cir. 1982). Indeed, the Court must first 
identify allegations that are conclusory and, thus, not entitled to the assumption of truth. 662, 
129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009). Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. A corollary: legal conclusions "must 
be supported by factual allegations." Id. at 1950. Assuming the veracity of the well-pleaded 
factual allegations, the Court must then determine "whether they plausibly give rise to an 
entitlement to relief." Id. "'To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient 
factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to 11 relief that is plausible on its face." 
Gonzalez v. Kay, 577 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir. 2009)(quoting lqbal, (2009))(internal quotation 
marks omitted). 129 S.Ct. at 1949 "Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief 
above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true 
(even if doubtful in fact)." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quotation 
marks, citations, and footnote omitted). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads 
factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable 
for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 ("The plausibility standard is not akin to a 
'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted 
unlawfully."). This is a "context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its 
judicial experience and common sense." Id. pleads facts that are merely consistent "Where a 
complaint with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility 
of entitlement to relief" U.S. at 557Xintemal quotations Id. (citing Twombly, 550 omitted). 
"[A] plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief", thus, 
"requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause 
of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citation omitted). In deciding a motion to 
dismiss, the Court may consider 12 documents that are essentially "part of the pleadings" -- that
