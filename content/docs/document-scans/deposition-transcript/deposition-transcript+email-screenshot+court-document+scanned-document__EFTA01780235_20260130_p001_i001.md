But he is for real HAPPY! After the year =e's had he deserves it . I'm glad. 
Would like to take the SONY up but I think we need a 46 " =r 47" for the first level and even Bigger (much) for 
the DOWN "entertainment center" long wall when we have a new budget - as my husband =ells me I've already 
exceeded mine ! shock. a =shonda" (sp)
