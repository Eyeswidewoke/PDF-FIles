In the mid-1960s, The Impressions were compared with Motown acts such as The Temptations, The 
Miracles, and The Four Tops. After 1965&#=9;s "Woman's Got Soul", and the #7 pop hit "Amen", The Impressions failed 
to reach the R&B Top Ten for three more years, final=y scoring in 1968 with the #9 "I Loved and Lost". "We're a Winner", 
which hit #1 on the R&B charts that same year, represente= a new level of social awareness in Mayfield's music. 
Mayfield created his=own label, Curtom, and moved The Impressions to the label. Over the next two ye=rs, more 
Impressions message tracks, including the #1 R&B hit "Choice =f Colors" (1969) and the #3 "Check Out Your Mind" 
(1970), beca=e big hits for the group. It is said that The Impressions were a huge influence on Bob Marley and The 
Wailers and oth=r ska/rocksteady groups in Jamaica: The Wailers modelled their singing/harmon= style on them and in 
part borrowed their look, too. There are many cover= of Impressions songs by The Wailers, including "Keep On Moving", 
"Long Long Winter&q=ot; and "Just Another Dance". Pat Kelly covered "Soulful Love&qu=t; and The Heptones covered 
"I've Been Trying". No doubt the =ocial consciousness of Curtis Mayfield's lyrics appealed as well as the spectacular 
harmonies.=/p> 
After the release of the Check Out Your Mind LP in 1970, Mayfield left the group and began a successful 
solo career, the highlight o= which was writing and producing the Super Fly soundtrack. After his success with this 
soundtrack, he collaborated on the soundtracks of Claudine, Spark=e, and A Piece of the Action. He continued to write 
and produce for The Impressions, who remained on Curtom. Leroy Hutson was the first new lead si=ger for the group 
following Mayfield's departure, but success eluded The Im=ressions, and Hutson left the group in 1973. New members 
Ralph Johnson and Reggie Tor=an replaced Hutson, and The Impressions had three R&B Top 5 singles in 1974-1975: the 
#1 "Finally Got Myself Together (I'm a Changed Ma=)" (which also reached the Pop top 20), and the #3 singles "Same 
Thing i= Took" and "Sooner or Later". In 1976, The Impressions left Curtom and Mayfield behind for Cotillion Records, 
and had their final major=hit with "Loving Power". The same year, Ralph Johnson was replaced by Nate Evans, who 
remained in the group for three years, during which time Th= Impressions switched to 20th Century Records. Singles and 
albums sales continued to slip, and Evans left in 1979, reducing the group to a trio. Th= album Fan the Flames was 
released in 1981. 
With this said, I hope that you enjoy a selection of the music of Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions.
