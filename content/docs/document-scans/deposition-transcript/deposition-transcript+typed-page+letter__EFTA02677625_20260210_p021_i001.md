R=tual—in this case, as in others, a familiar hymn—had transformed an otherwise hopeless recipient o= care into 
someone quite different. At least for those few minutes, he had become a human being capable of reaching out =nd 
caring for others, a beacon of light and joy to everyone. We simply do n=t know what is transpiring in the mind of 
another person. It is all too easy to place all the blame on th= dementia patient, lamenting and even despising their 
disability. But were w= to do so, we would be letting ourselves off the hook a bit too soon. Awareness= understanding, 
and affection are not merely the outputs of some inner dynam=. They also emerge in response to what others do, say, 
and feel. In some c=ses, unresponsiveness may say less about a patient's disability than a failure on our part to offer 
someth=ng worth responding to. So if you have a friend, relative or love one suffering from dementia, although not a 
cure, keeping them engaged helps.

I recently heard=a pundit on one of the Sunday morning network news programs describe one or President Lyndon 
Johnson's signatur= achievements, the War On Poverty, as a failure when this is a= absolute distortion of the truth. In 
an Huffington Post article this week =y Jillian Berman — This Is What Poverty Would Look Like If The GOP Had Its Way —
that a new study by Columbia University researc=ers released this week — Without the War on Poverty's govern=ent 
programs such as food stamps, Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit, America's poverty rate would have jumped 
from 25 percent to 31 percent =etween 1967 and 2012. Instead, it fell from 19 percent to 16 percent during that period. 
(The chart below shows what the SPM would have been without government programs in dark blue and what it actually 
was in light blue.) 
Government programs have been especially effective at reducing what is known as the "deep poverty rate," or the share 
of people living below 50 percent of t=e poverty threshold, the researchers found. Without government programs, t=e 
deep poverty rate would have been 19.2 percent in 2012. Instead, it was 5.3 percent.=A0 "These government policies 
and programs have really kept that deep poverty rate pr=tty remarkably flat," said Chris Wimer, a research scientist at 
Columb=a University's Population Research Center and one of the authors of the s=udy. "Even as the business cycle 
goes up and down, we've been able to hold back real serious deprivation at the bottom." 
Though the War on Poverty was largely a bipart=san undertaking in its early years, Republicans -- led by Ronald Reagan -
- star=ed questioning its merits in the 1980s. In 1988, Reagan famously quipped: "In the '60s, we waged a war on 
poverty, and poverty won." Republican =arling Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) will likely continue that ideological tradition 
with a speech he is due to deliver from the LBJ Room of the Capitol on Wednesday. "After 50 years isn't it time to 
declare big government's war on poverty a fai=ure?" Rubio asked in a video released on Sunday. He went on to 
advocate "a real agenda that helps people acquire the skills they need" instead of spendin= more on government 
programs. To that end, over the past few years, Republicans have proposed cutting food stamps and Social Security 
benefits.
