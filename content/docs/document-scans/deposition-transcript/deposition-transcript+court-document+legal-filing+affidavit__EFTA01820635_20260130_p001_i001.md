Bad news is often stickler than good news. Regardless of whether it's true or not, it's something 
hat certainly holds true for the economic outlook of the Gulf. Dubai in particular has received a 
evere lashing from the international press since late 2008, with the UAE's largest city painted not 
merely as a victim of the global economic malaise but as a symbol of hubristic overreach that 
received its deserved comeuppance. 
growing number of economists say the pessimism has been overdone and that the picture for 
he Gulf is not nearly as dark as it seemed just a few months ago. Indeed, a consensus is building 
hat not only is the region headed for robust recovery, but that the silver lining may soon eclipse 
he cloud itself. 
Some experts say the Dubai crash, along with the lessons likely to be learned from it, may have 
ven been the best thing that could have happened to the UAE and its neighbors, for if the 2002-
2008 boom had continued, a number of much needed reforms might have been delayed 
ndefinitely, leading to more lasting damage further down the road. 
o be sure, those interested in the bad news have no shortage of stories to choose from. There's 
he $10 billion fraud allegation leveled against the head of Saudi conglomerate Saad Group, a 
candal that suggests lending practices at Gulf banks have been less than stringent. 
• r to take a more recent example, the "travel news" section of The Timesnewspaper recently 
reported - on tenuous grounds, citing a single unnamed property agent as its source - that 
Nakheel's landmark island chain development The World had been "canceled," the quoted source 
dding that the man-made archipelago "doesn't even look like the world" and that most of it 
resembles "a pile of muck." The suicide of the buyer of Ireland was offered as further evidence of 
he World's apparent failure. 
Never mind Nakheel's assurances, published in the Dubai daily the Khaleej Times, that it has 
ready handed over 33 islands to buyers, or the recent report inArabian Business that Safi

2008 started building on it immediately after Ramadan. The World, rightly or wrongly, has 
become yet another symbol of Dubai's folly. 
he case of Nakheel is emblematic of the rush to judgment in a situation more nuanced than mos'
boosters or detractors would have it. Like many Dubai developers, Nakheel is a troubled firm. Its 
bonds and sukuk (Islamic bond) certificates were trading at levels that resembled junk bonds 
arlier this year, with yields reaching as high as 85 percent at one point. Several developments 
have been suspended before they even began, including another man-made island chain slated to 
urround The World called - what else? - The Universe, announced at the boom's tail end in 2008. 
ther projects have been subjected to little or no scrutiny. Take Dubai Promenade, for instance, a
