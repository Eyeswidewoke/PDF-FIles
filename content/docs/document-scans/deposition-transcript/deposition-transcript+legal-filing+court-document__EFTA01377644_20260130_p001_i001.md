S-I/A 
By making our services accessible to everyone, we can build a more fair and productive system that serves instead of rules. 
This is both good for Square and the right thing to do. We're off to a strong start. 
As a public company our decisions will continue to reflect what we've done as a private one—we put our customers first. 
That means constantly asking the question: how can the financial system better serve people? Well measure ourselves by our 
commitment to take the long view and focus on building a company that creates value over decades and not just a few fiscal 
quarters out.

I believe so much in the potential of this company to drive positive impact in my lifetime that over the past two years I have 
given over 15 million shares, or 20% of my own equity, back to both Square and the Start Small Foundation, a new organization I 
created to meaningfully invest in the folks who inspire us: artists, musicians, and local businesses, with a special focus on 
underserved communities around the world. The shares being made available for the directed share program in this offering are 
being sold by the Start Small Foundation, giving Square customers the ability to buy equity to support the Foundation. I have also 
committed to give 40 million more of my shares, an additional 10% of the company, to invest in this cause. I'd rather have a smaller 
part of something big than a bigger part of something small. 
We intend to make this big! Thank you for your support and potential investment in Square.
