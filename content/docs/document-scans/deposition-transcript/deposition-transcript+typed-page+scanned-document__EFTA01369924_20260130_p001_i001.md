If the Offer is consummated. Purchaser expects that certain of the current directors of the Mobileye Board 
will resign. other than at least two independent, non-executive directors as mutually agreed upon by Purchaser 
and Mobileye (unless two of the current independent, non-executive directors do not agree to serve on the 
Mobileye Board after the Offer Closing, in which case Purchaser shall designate replacement directors who shall 
at all times be independent from Intel and Purchaser), who Purchaser expects will remain on the Mobileye Board 
until the earlier of (a) such time after the Offer Closing as Purchaser owns 1004E of the outstanding Shares and 
(b) the date the completion of the Second Step Distribution and Liquidation. Purchaser expects that, subject to 
the receipt of approval of the Governance Resolutions by Mobileye shareholders at the EGM. at least five 
designees of Purchaser will be appointed to the Mobileye Board effective upon the Offer Closing. 
After the Offer Closing. Purchaser intends to cause Mobileye to terminate the listing of the Shares on the 
NYSE (the "Delisting"). As a result, we anticipate that there will not be an active trading market for the Shares. 
In addition, after the Offer Closing. Purchaser intends to cause Mobileye to terminate the registration of the 
Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable and take steps to cause the suspension of the reporting 
obligations with respect to Mobileye's Shares with the SEC. 
In addition, you should be aware that, after amendment of Mobileye's articles of association, following the 
Offer Closing, pursuant to the Conversion Resolutions proposed to be approved at the EGM. record ownership of 
Mobileye shares can only be transferred pursuant to a notarial deed executed before a Dutch notary, which will 
require compliance with various administrative formalities under Dutch law and will require shareholders to 
incur costs for Dutch notarial fees when they transfer Mobileye shares. If such amendment to Mobileye's articles 
of association becomes effective prior to or during the Subsequent Offering Period or the Minority Exit Offering 
Period, then all transfers of record ownership of the Shares to the Purchaser during the Subsequent Offering 
Period and (if applicable) the Minority Exit Offering Period must be effected by way of a notarial deed executed 
before a Dutch notary: this will cause transfers of record ownership of Shares to the Purchaser during such 
extensions of the Offer to be substantially more expensive, cumbersome and time-consuming than transfers of 
record ownership of Shares to the Purchaser prior to the Expiration Time. Furthermore. you should be aware that 
after the second amendment of Mobileye's articles of association pursuant to the Conversion Resolutions 
following the Delisting ("Amendment No. 2"). any share acquired by a Mobileye shareholder after the date of 
Amendment No. 2 would not be transferable prior to March I, 2019. unless the Mobileye Board has approved 
such transfer. 
If you sell your Shares pursuant to the Offer (including during the Subsequent Offering Period (as it may be 
extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period)), you will cease to have any equity interest in Mobileye or any 
right to participate in its earnings and future growth. If you do not tender your Shares, but the Post-Offer 
Reorganization is consummated. you also will no longer have an equity interest in Mobileye. Similarly. after 
selling your Shares pursuant to the Offer (including during the Subsequent Offering Period (as it may be 
extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period)), you will not bear the risk of any decrease in the value of 
Mobileye. 
Post-Offer Reorganization. As promptly as practicable following the closing of the Subsequent Offering 
Period (as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period). Intel or Purchaser may effectuate or cause 
to be effectuated, at Intel's or Purchaser's election, the Post-Offer Reorganization. The Post-Offer 
Reorganization will utilize processes available to Purchaser under Dutch law to ensure that (a) Purchaser 
becomes the owner of all of Mobileye's business operations from and after the consummation of the Post-Offer 
Reorganization and (b) any Mobileye shareholders who do not tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer 
(including during the Subsequent Offering Period (as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period)) 
are offered or receive the same consideration for their Shares as those shareholders who tendered their Shares 
pursuant to the Offer (including during the Subsequent Offering Period (as it may be extended by the Minority 
Exit Offering Period)), without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 
the event that the Compulsory Acquisition is implemented. then the Dutch Court will determine the price to be 
paid for the Shares. Although Intel and Purchaser will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the per Share
