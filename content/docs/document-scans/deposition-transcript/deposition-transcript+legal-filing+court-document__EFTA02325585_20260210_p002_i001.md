Composer John Cage, author of the =amous piece of silence known as 4'33", described the paintings as landing 
=trips for invisible motes and shadows. Rauschenberg called them =locks: 
If one were sensitive enough that you could read it, =hat you would know how many people were in the 
room, what time it was, =nd what the weather was like outside. 
Many artists have tried to follow =onvincingly in Malevich's and Rauschenberg's footsteps, with little =uccess. 
Muscovite Vladimir Weisberg devoted much of his working =ife to painting ethereal, mostly geometric shapes in shades 
of white on =hite backgrounds. He explained: 
Color exists but it constrains me. =t's better when feelings, consciousness, an understanding of truth 
have = claim on me, I am not afraid to liberate myself from =olor. 
Weisberg's=work was too strange for the Soviet Union's tame official art scene, =nd his first big exhibition took 
place three years after he died, =n 1988. One white-on-white painting, =ith just a hint of shyly glimmering shapes, sold 
for $139,280 at =otheby's in London in 2006. A stitched-together white canvas by =ustralian-born Lawrence Carroll was 
valued at between $23,200 and =32,200 at a Sotheby's auction in Milan. It failed to sell. 
So what is so special about the =961 work by =merican conceptualist Robert Ryman that fetched $15 million in 
New York =his week? Or the nearly identical one below, also by Ryman, which =old for $5.2 million yesterday?

It's white in a slightly different way than his =redecessors' work, or his own previous oeuvre (he painted his first 
=hite canvasses in the 1950s), but it's still, well, white. Ryman's explanation of his fondness for the purest of all colors 
=choes Rauschenberg's: 
White has a tendency to make =hings visible. With white, you can see more of a nuance; you can see 
=ore. I've said before that, if you spill coffee on a white =hirt, you can see the coffee very clearly. If you spill it on a dark 
=hirt, you don't see it as well. 
The most probable reason for the =rice lies outside the realm of art, even defined broadly as a =ymbiosis of 
painting and explanation. Alexander Rotter, co-head of the =ontemporary art department at auction house Sotheby's, 
simply decided =hat Ryman needed a push. "I thought there was really something to be =one with the market, that's 
why it's been priced so high," the New York =bserver quoted him as saying of the untitled painting. "The =ublic needs a 
great piece to elevate the market and give it an =ndication of where it could go. The sky is the limit for this =ainting." 
Clear thinking from leading voices in business, =conomics, politics, foreign affairs, culture, and more.

If one wanted =o be poetic about this piece of marketing wisdom, one could say Rotter =s talking of the same 
sky whose lining Malevich claimed to have =vercome. I'm more inclined to call it cynical. In the end, the value of =rt is in 
the emotions it conveys, its power of holding one's eye and =ccupying one's thoughts. A white canvas may have had the 
requisite =owers in 1918 or even in 1951, because it made a radical statement. In =014, it's meaningless. The business 
decision behind the insane price is =he only true piece of art in the case of Ryman's works. 
Even in the highly unlikely =vent that certain art lovers are moved by the spectacle of =nadulterated whiteness, 
there's no need to pay millions of dollars for =he pleasure. They can simply follow Rauschenberg's advice: "Want =ne? 
Paint one."
