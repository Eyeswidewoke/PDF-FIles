About your payments 
When you must pay 
Payment of the New Balance is due upon receipt of 
your statement. If a statement includes a Pay Over 
Time balance, it will show a Minimum Payment Due. 
In this case, you must pay at least the Minimum 
Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. Each 
statement also states the time and manner by which 
you must make your payment for it to be credited as 
Make payments to us in U.S. dollars with: 
• a single check drawn on a V.S. bank. or 
• a single negotiable instrument clearable through 
the U.S. banking system, for example a money 
order. or 
• an electronic payment that can be cleared through 
the U.S. banking system. 
When making a payment by mail: 
• make a separate payment for each account, 
• mail your payment to the address shown on the 
payment coupon on your billing statement, and 
• write your Account number on your check or 
negotiable instrument and include the payment 
coupon. 
If your payment meets the above requirements, we 
will credit it to your Account as of the day we receive 
it, as long as we receive it by the time disclosed in 
II a statement includes a Pay Over Time balance, it 
will show a Minimum Payment Due. The Minimum 
Payment Due is the Pay In Full New Balance plus 
the Pay Over Time Minimum Due. 
If you have a Pay Over Time balance, we generally 
apply payments—up to the Minimum Payment 
Due—first to the Pay Over Time Minimum Due and 
then to the Pay In Full New Balance. When applying 
a payment to the Pay Over Time Minimum Due, we 
apply it first to the balance with the lowest interest 
of the same day it is received. 
Each statement also shows a Closing Date. The 
Closing Date is the last day of the billing period 
covered by the statement. Each Closing Date is 
about 30 days after the previous statement's Closing 
Date. 
How to make payments 
your billing statement. If we receive it after that time. 
we will credit the payment on the day after we 
receive it. 
If your payment does not meet the above 
requirements, there may be a delay in crediting your 
Account. This may result in late fees and additional 
interest charges (see Now Rates and Fees Work on 
page 2 of Part 1). 
If we decide to accept a payment made in a foreign 
currency, we will choose a rate to convert your 
payment into U.S. dollars, unless the law requires us 
to use a particular rate. 
If we process a late payment a partial payment or a 
payment marked with any restrictive language, that 
wit have no effect on our rights and will not change 
this Agreement.

rate and then to balances with higher interest rates. 
After the Minimum Payment Due has been paid, we 
apply payments to the remaining Pay Over Time bal-
ance. When we do this, we apply payments first to 
the balance with the highest interest rate and then to 
balances with lower interest rates. 
In most cases, we apply a credit to the same bal-
ance as the related charge. We may apply payments 
and credits within balances, and among balances 
with the same interest rate, in any order we choose. 
About your Minimum Payment Due 
How we calculate your 
The Minimum Payment Due is the Pay In Full amount 
Minimum Payment Due 
To calculate the Pay Over Time Minimum Due for 
each statement, we start with the highest of the 
following three amounts: 
(1) 2% of the Pay Over Time New Balance; or 
(2) interest charged on the statement plus 1% of the 
Pay Over Time New Balance (excluding interest 
on the statement), not to exceed 4% of the Pay 
Over Time New Balance; or 
(3)520. 
Then we round to the nearest dollar. After that we 
add any Pay Over Time amount past due. 
However, your Pay Over Tine Minimum Due will not 
exceed your Pay Over Tine New Balance. 
plus any Pay Over Time Minimum Due.
EXAMPLE: Pay Over Time Minimum Due 
Assume that your Pay Over Time New Balance 
is $3,000, interest is $29.57 (see the example on 
the next page). and you hove no Pay Over Time 
amounts past due. 
(1) 2% x 53.000 = $60.00 
(2) 529.57 
1% x (53,000 - 529.57) = $59.27 
(3) $20.00 
The highest of the three amounts is 560.0O. 
So the Pay Over Tim* Minimum Due is $60.00. 
Adjusting your Pay Over 
Time Minimum Due 
CMAEUACM0000101 
II you regularly pay more than the Minimum Payment Due described above, we may adjust the Pay Over 
Time Minimum Due in future billing periods. This may let you make a smaller minimum payment from time 
to time. But if you then do not regularly pay more than the Minimum Payment Due described above, we will 
stop making the adjustment and return to the formula above. If we start or stop making the adjustment we 
will do so for at least six billing periods in a row. To adjust the Pay Over Time Minimum Due, we will not 
add 1% of the Pay Over Time New Balance in (2). Then, if (2) is the highest (but less than 4% of the Pay 
Over Time New Balance), we will add S16.
