such jurisdiction, my Executor shall designate a successor Executor to serve in such jurisdiction. 
Such designation shall be made by written instrument delivered to such successor Executor. 
C. 
No bond or other security shall be required of any 
Executor in any jurisdiction. 
D. 
Any Executor may resign by filing a written notice 
of resignation with the Court having jurisdiction of the administration of my estate. All of my 
Executor's fees and expenses (including attorneys' fees) attributable to the appointment of a 
successor Executor shall be paid by my estate. 
E. 
My Executor shall not be accountable or 
responsible to any person interested in my estate for the manner in which my Executor in good 
faith exercises or declines to exercise any discretionary authority or power of my Executor. My 
Executor shall not be liable for any loss or depreciation in value occasioned by reason of any 
negligence, error or mistake of judgment in entering into any transaction, in making any sale or 
investment, in continuing to hold any property or by reason of any action or omission, whether 
by my Executor or any other fiduciary, unless my Executor has acted in bad faith. In the absence 
of proof by affirmative evidence to the contrary, each Executor shall be deemed to have acted 
within the scope of my Executor's authority, to have exercised reasonable care, diligence and 
prudence and to have acted impartially as to all interested persons. An Executor shall not be 
liable for the acts or defaults of another Executor. 
FOURTH: 
The following provisions shall apply to my estate and to my 
Executor, except as is otherwise specifically provided in this Will: 
(1) 
My Executor has the entire care and 
custody of all assets of my estate. My Executor has the power to do everything my Executor in 
good faith deems advisable without necessity of any judicial authorization or approval, even 
though but for this power it would not be authorized or appropriate for fiduciaries under any 
statutory or other rule of law. My Executor shall exercise my Executor's best judgment and 
discretion for what my Executor believes to be in the best interests of the beneficiaries 
hereunder. If more than two Executors are empowered to participate in the decision to exercise 
or not exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law, a majority of such Executors 
shall be empowered to make such decision. 
B. 
Except as otherwise provided herein, my Executor 
shall have the power: 
(1) 
to enter upon and take possession of the 
assets of my estate and collect the income and profits from such assets, and to invest and 
reinvest such assets in real, personal or mixed assets (including the common trust funds of a 
corporate fiduciary) or in undivided interests therein without being limited by any present or 
future investment laws; 
(2) 
to retain all or any part of the assets of my 
estate (without regard to the proportion that any one asset or class of assets may bear to the 
whole) in the form in which such assets were received or acquired by my Executor;
