Mathematics ideals are universal truths, biology is intrinsically based in=deception . Predators in search of free energy, 
would be able to decipher a=d consume, if it weren't couched in a multi layered encrypted form . Even s=lf deception 
acts as a defensive strategy. More later

He referenced "The Age Of Wo=der", by Richard Holmes, in which the first Romantic Age described by Holme= was 
centered on chemistry and poetry, while Dyson pointed out that this ne= age is dominated by computational biology. Its 
leaders, he noted, include "=iology wizards" Kary Mullis, Craig Venter, medical engineer Dean Kamen; and="computer 
wizards" Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Charles Simonyi. He poin=ed out that the nexus for this intellectual activity —
the Lunar So=iety for the 21st century — is centered around the activities of ED=E. 
> Dyson continued to articulate his vision for a new age of biology in a rel=ted review inNew York Review of Books in 
which he wrote: "...a new generati=n of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote verses, m=ght 
create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to enr=ch the ecology of our planet. Most of these 
artists would be amateurs, but trey would be in close touch with science, like the poets of the earlier Age o= Wonder. 
The new Age of Wonder might bring together wealthy entrepreneurs l=ke Venter and Kamen ... and a worldwide 
community of gardeners and farmers a=d breeders, working together to make the planet beautiful as well as fertil=, 
hospitable to hummingbirds as well as to humans."
