THE STORY BEHIND THE HLX8 
My name is David LaPoint and I am a 51 year old engineer/inventor/physicist from 
Huntington Beach, California. I have over 30 years of experience designing and building 
very complex high tech machines and processes for industry. Some of these have been 
computer controlled with hundreds of inputs and outputs monitored and controlled in 
real time. I have patents on some of these machines and processes dating back to the 
1970's. That being said I am amazed at some of the results from discoveries I made in 
December 2006. Much of it is flat out unbelievable to most people. What you are about 
to read is the truth. I will and have staked my life and entire life savings on it. 
In December of 2006 I was working on controlling the flow of ions with a very unique 
array of magnets. I was doing this because of an understanding of the structure of 
matter that is entirely different from other physicists. This understanding of the structure 
of matter led to several breakthroughs in a very short period of time in late 2006. One of 
the most outstanding developments led to the completion of a machine on December 
25, 2006. Because of this I initially called the machine the "Christmas Machine". We 
have since renamed this machine the HLX8 for marketing purposes. This machine was 
designed and built to heal the human body from outside using a structured tornado-like 
field of ions. This field of ions was then going to cause the cells within the human body 
to align to the optimum condition for health, life and treatment of many diseases. More 
specifically I designed this machine to eliminate cancer within the human body totally 
non-invasively. Well, almost unbelievably this machine has produced results that 
exceeded even my expectations. 
As soon as I finished the first HLX8 machine I began using it on myself. Although I had 
no known cancer, I did have back problems that had bothered me for years. I also 
suffered from thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) which would have my right arm and hand 
numb after using the computer for as little as one hour. This condition is caused when 
the main nerve bundle that runs down your arm is pinched by inflamed muscles and 
tendons. I probably acquired TOS from years of using computer workstations for 
designing machines in advance 3d CAD programs for many hours per day over 20 
years. My doctors had been totally unsuccessful in giving me any significant relief from 
TOS over the years. This is typical for patients with TOS. Not much relief can be 
obtained without eliminating the initial activity that brought on TOS. But after using the 
HLX8 for two hours a day for four days all symptoms of TOS were gone along with all 
my back problems. I also experienced a great increase in energy and endurance. I had 
not felt so good in over 20 years. I knew I had something big. 
I told a friend of mine about the machine and my results. He began to use the machine 
for his back problems that had plagued him for years. His name is Kyle and you can 
read his story along with others we have in our testimonials. Kyle also experienced 
dramatic results that left him feeling better than he had in years. Kyle came on board 
working with me to help get this technology out to the world in January 2007.
