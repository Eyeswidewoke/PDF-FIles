Re: Ty and 
wow. ok. I agree with you completely 
.you seem to think I don't, but I am 
on board. I do not want a looser son. Agree he lives quite well and really 
doesn't even know it. 
I think we need to all revisit this tonight.

10 chances to do the right thing. He chose to not do the right

may be a bad grade on a test. Bad grade on a test leads to bad grade in the 
class, it just keep going and leads to bad future with no prospects in life. 
Being hopeless and scared and a terrible place to be . 
> We demanded very little of him yesterday. He helped me for 15 min then left 
and spent 90 minutes with a friend, he played basketball in a fun game. he went 
and wrapped gifts for one hour by the time he got there with a bunch of his 
friends by the way. He did bottles and cans for 20 min so he has $25 to spend 
not for my or your benefit. He did a 35 min workout that was overall pretty easy 
since he was sore.

It will be hard to get into school. People will be offered jobs who 
are lesser than him for diversity. It is what it is but it is fact.

chooses not to read all weekend then he needs to get it done. if he chooses to 
go to a friend's house that is his choice. If he chooses to play video games 
until 12:30 am on Saturday and Ijamfirst thing he did when he got up is go turn 
on the video games, not go see 
not get food. Video games
