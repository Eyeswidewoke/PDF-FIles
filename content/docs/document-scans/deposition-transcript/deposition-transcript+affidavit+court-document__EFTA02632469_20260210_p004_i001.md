To move this along I would suggest the following: a r=ugh detailed draft of a 
term sheet with seller companies detailed. h=w many entities? an amount of cash left back and an amount of dolla=s 
also spread over a number of years. default suggestions and =C2* your ideas on how to deal with liablity. 40=A0 ie 
ny class action waiting to be certified.. =C24> others like paris etc. thank you.

I would add that you are selling an offshore vehicle formed under an agr=ement

The whole co is not for sal= and if so we might argue along some similar but less exagerrated

i already pointed out =urrency exchange, board fees etc. as a bad number in 
your calculations.,=A0 sorry....the other transactions that we know very well are far fr=m relevant.. if faith and joel 
walk there is NO business which is h=rdly the same idea as IMG where multi divisions exist and succession is pl=nned. I 
do not know what cash was on the balance sheet w=en you bought it. 
The open gate transaction =o summarize was a 
stepping into your shoes for only 6 million =r roughly the same as the current offer. taking out cash 14 o= the 15 mil 
which has not come out. and even on your calculation of = cash would mean 3.2 to you back then... and then leveraging

comps and can sho= mom and pop at 1 to 3 times ebitda.. 4>=A0 so lets try to short circuit a tiresome uncessary 
excercise, Q=A0 as i see it the current bid offer is 5 bid and approx 9.2 offer. =C24> open gates 6 + 3.2 from 2 years 
ago with more growth pot=ntial and lower cash out. multiples from before digital photos and a=azon. sorry 
I am 
suprised that you would inflate current Ebitda,=C2* pull multiples from many years ago to biz that are tangential. 
=leave out liabilites even of lawsuits that you know about, and then =ick a cash number to subtract for enterprise value. 
If I have misunderstoo= and you are not really sellers then I will not be insulted if you decide =o cancel our call.
