Quarterly trends 
Quarterly Direct Revenue has generally increased sequentially, driven by growth in Average PMC in most periods, partially offset by sequential decreases in 
ARPPU in a number of periods. ARPPU decreases in sequential quarters are driven largely by mix shifts to lower monetizing brands. In the three months 
ended March 31. 2015. June 30. 2015 and September 30. 2015. foreign exchange movements meaningfully affected International Direct Revenue and total 
Direct Revenue growth. But for the significant effects of foreign exchange. International Direct Revenue and total Direct Dating Revenue in the three months 
ended March 31. 2015 would have also sequentially increased. 
Our advertising spend is typically higher during the first quarter of a fiscal year. and lower during the fourth quarter. This mix is driven by the seasonally low 
cost of advertising during the first quarter, coupled with the seasonally high demand for our products at such time, and the seasonally high cost of advertising 
in the fourth quarter coupled with the seasonally low demand for our products at such time.
Adjusted EBITDA is generally increasing sequentially and on a year on year basis, but is impacted by the aforementioned selling and marketing trends, which 
drive lower or sometimes negative, year on year Adjusted EBTIDA growth in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Increased investment in Non-dating driven by 
the acquisition of The Princeton Review also negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA beginning with the three months ended September 30, 2014 through the 
second quarter of 2015. Non-dating reported positive Adjusted EBITDA for the first time in the third quarter of 2015, which is its seasonally strongest quarter.
