Fauci Says Effectiveness Of Vaccines Will Be Evident By Early December. 
Reuters (10/25, James) reports NIAID Director Fauci "said on Sunday it would be clear whether 
a COVID-19 vaccine was safe and effective by early December, but that more widespread 
vaccination would not be likely until later in 2021." Fauci told the BBC, "We will know whether a 
vaccine is safe and effective by the end of November, the beginning of December." Fauci added, 
"When you talk about vaccinating a substantial proportion of the population, so that you can 
have a significant impact on the dynamics of the outbreak, that very likely will not be until the 
second or third quarter of the year." The Hill (10/25, Choi, 2.98M) reports Fauci "made the 
remarks during a discussion on President Trump's claims of having a vaccine ready by the end 
of the year." 
Trump, Administration Officials Defend Response To Coronavirus. 
President Trump was asked in an interview with CBS' 60 MinutesVi (10/25, 8.66M) about 
increases in coronavirus cases in 40 states. Trump said, "You know why cases are up also? 
Because we do more testing. The fake news media loves to say cases are up." Trump added, 
"We have turned the corner. We understand the disease. We understand the elderly, and we are 
taking care of them like nobody's ever taken care of them. So we are taking care of our 
people." 
In an interview with Fox News' Life Liberty and Levin, Vice President Pence criticized the 
Obama Administration's response to the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic in 2009. Pence said, "In a 
very real sense, they had an utterly failed response. I mean, by the fall of 2009, when Joe 
Biden was vice president, the swine flu...had infected 60 million Americans, and if it had had 
the same fatality rate as the coronavirus does, we would have lost more than two million 
American lives." Pence contrasted that with President Trump, who, he said, took "decisive action 
to put the health of America first. And all along the way, he listened to the scientists ... I'm 
absolutely convinced that because of the President's leadership, because of our partnership with 
state health officials, because of doctors and nurses, and because of the cooperation of the 
American people, that we literally saved hundreds of thousands of American lives." 
Pence was asked in an interview with CBS' 60 MinutesVi (10/25, 8.66M) about the 
President's criticism of NIAID Director Fauci and other public health experts. Pence said, "The 
scientists who've worked around the White House Coronavirus Task Force, who will meet again 
today here at the White House have provided a great public service. They've brought the 
perspective of scientists all along the way. And I have a strong relationship with Dr. Fauci and 
Dr. Birx. But remember, the President of the United States has to consider the whole of 
America. The President's been balancing the broad interests of the country - and the health of 
the American people, and well continue to do that every day." 
Chief of Staff Meadows, on CNN's State Of The UnionVi (10/25, 1.29M), discussed the 
Trump Administration's efforts to address the coronavirus. Meadows said, "I agree it's very 
serious. We continue to test more than most other countries so the cases that we find will go 
up. If you're not testing, you're not finding it so a lot of these other countries are not testing 
near at the rate we are testing at. ... What is Joe Biden's plan for the pandemic? How is he 
going to do it? He is going to wear two masks like he does every day and suggest we skip 
Thanksgiving. He doesn't have a plan. He has rhetoric because you and I both know for 47 
years, he's talked about things and not done things. You've covered him. I know him. The 
American people should know his record." 
National Security Adviser O'Brien, on CBS' Face The NationVI (10/25, 2.68M), said, "It is 
spiking in Europe. It is running rampant through Europe. I was just in Brazil and South America 
to sign three new trade deals, and it is running rampant through Brazil. This is a terrible virus. 
At the end of the day, what we need to do is flatten the curb and protect the most vulnerable. 
We need to protect the elderly and those who are frail and have pre-existing conditions. 
Ultimately, the only thing that is going to stop this virus - there is no magic way - what will is a
