Kane County Fanns 
The Property. We acquired Kane County Farms, a commodity row crop farm in the premier corn 
producing area of North-Central Illinois, in June 2011 for a purchase price of approximately 
$17.2 million. Kane County Farms consists of 1,652 gross acres, with 1,617 tillable acres, currently 
planted with corn in rotation with soybeans on four separate parcels. We hold Kane County Farms in 
fee simple through our wholly owned subsidiary Abraham (IL) LLC. On June 30. 2015, Cochran Ag 
Services, Inc., an independent Illinois certified general real estate appraiser, concluded that the market 
value of the property was $193 million, relying most heavily on the comparable sales approach to 
valuation. We have no immediate plans to improve the property. We believe that there may be some 
potential for residential development upon disposition in the future as one parcel abuts the 54th ranked 
modern golf course, as per Golfweek's 2015 ratings, and with suburban sprawl of the greater Chicago/ 
Aurora metropolitan area. 
Demand Generators and Competition. Kane County Farms is a commodity row crop farm located in 
a premier corn-producing area of Illinois for which there is an established and highly competitive 
tenant market. Continued global growth in population and consumer income and the demand for 
biofucls (e.g., ethanol from corn) and the increasing need for feed for livestock, as well as the location 
and high-quality soils (90% Class I) of this property, should, in our opinion, continue to drive leasing 
demand for this farm.

Description of Tenants 
Our farms arc leased to 15 separate third-party tenants, of which the tenant at our Golden Eagle 
Ranch farm represented approximately 38.7% of our 2014 contractual rent. Additionally, our tenants at 
Blue Heron Farms, Kane County Farms, Pleasant Plains, Sandpiper Ranch, Sweetwater Farm and Quail 
Run Vineyard represented approximately 11.7%, 10.6%, 7.6%, 6.1%, 5.7% and 5.6%, respectively, of 
our 2014 contractual rent received through December 31, 2014, which does not include certain rent to 
be paid under 2014 participating leases that was not recognized in 2014. No other tenant represents 
greater than 5.0% of our 2014 contractual rent. 
The tenant at our Golden Eagle Ranch farm represents approximately 57.6% of our 2015 
contractual rent received through June 30, 2015, due in large part to the timing of the sale of the 2014 
harvest in 2015 as well as increased almond prices. Our tenants at Kane County Farms, Pleasant Plains 
and Blue Heron Farms represented approximately 7.5%, 5.4% and 5.2%, respectively, of our 2015 
contractual rent received through June 30, 2015, which does not include certain rent to be paid under 
participating leases that has not yet been recognized. No other tenant represents greater than 5.0% of
