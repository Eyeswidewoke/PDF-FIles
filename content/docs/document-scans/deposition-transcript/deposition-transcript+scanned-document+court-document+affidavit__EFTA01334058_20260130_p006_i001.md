MORE HEAT FOR BEL AIR BURGLAR 
New York Poet. New York, N.Y.: May 26, 2005. pg. 012 
Abstract (Document Summary) 
NOW that his romance with Serena Williams has gone south, randy director Brett Ratner seems to be settling 
down with his former gal pal. Model Alina Pascau has been flashing a massive canary-yellow diamond 
engagement ring Ratner recently gave her, we're told. Pascau, a Romanian stunner, used to date reclusive 
billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, who handles Leslie Wexner's fortune, helped land her a gig modeling for 
Wexner's Victoria's Secret brand, wehear, and paid for her to live in high style. After they broke up she and 
Ratner dated for a while before his fling with Williams. "She's beautiful, but dumb as paint," one pal of Pascau 
told us. "She never washes her hair and she always has a cellphone glued to her ear. Without Jeffrey she would 
never have gotten the Victoria's Secret job." Pascau, who likes high-profile men, also used to bed down with 
Formula I driver Eddie Irvine. Ratners rep did not retum calls. 
YOU can't watch Arthur Chi'en on WCBS/Ch. 2 any more - the reporter was fired last week for uttering the "f 
word" on-air - but you can buy a plethora of products with his face on it Cafepress.com is hawking a line of 
Chi'en-branded mugs, T-shirts, buttons, tote bags, messenger bags, barbecue aprons, teddy bears and even a 
"Chi'en Classic Thong." Some are emblazoned with the words, 'What the [bleep] is your problem, man? - the 
question Chi'en, who thought he was off the air, yelled out to twohecklers. David Yee, who is selling the Chi'en 
merchandise, said he was inspired by the popular T-shirts of revolutionary Che Guevara. "Chi'en sort of sounds 
like Che," he explained. "People are buying i17 Meanwhile, Chi'en's friend Ian Gerard, the founder of Gen Art, 
has circulated an e-mail calling the firing "ridiculous," and urging recipients to complain to various Viacom and 
Channel 2 executives. Chi'en tells us he was "devastated" by his dismissal, and says he's currently looking for a 
new job. "I've got bigger things to worry about than the shirts, basically," he said.

YOUNG Hollywood can rest easier now that police have arrested the man suspected of committing a string of 
burglaries in the Beverly Hills and Bel Air area. 
Darnell Riley, 28, was officially busted two months ago in connection with a burglary/robbery at "Girls Gone 
Wild" gazillionaire Joe Francis' home in January 2004 - but he's also being investigated for break-ins at the 
homes of Paris Hilton, baby oil heiress Casey Johnson, club promoter Tommy Alastra and other L.A. celebs. 
A source said the crime ring used a gorgeous Elite model, still at large, to infiltrate the Hollywood party scene: 
"She would befriend the men, get the security codes to their homes and then send Riley in." 
Just before the 2004 Golden Globes, Francis returned to his Bel Air home as it was being robbed. The intruder 
Francis recently identified as Riley held him at gunpoint and stole $300,000 in cash and valuables. 
Sources added that Francis was "being blackmailed" Francis would only say, "I can confirm I was robbed at 
gunpoint." 
When Hilton's home was burgled in September of 2004, it looked eerily similar to the Francis break-in. 
At the time, Hilton spokesman Elliot Mintz confirmed that a "very, very professional" gang swiped more than 
$100,000 worth of jewelry, cash, video tapes and other items from the Hollywood Hills house Paris was renting 
with her sister, Nicky. 
After the burglary, more Hilton sex tapes mysteriously appeared, and damaging reports surfaced of a tape 
where Hilton supposedly used the "n-word." 
Insiders say Hilton paid dearly to make sure the tape was never found. A source said, "She was blackmailed. 
She paid $20,000 a month to have that tape not released." Hilton told PAGE SIX via her rep, "Anyone who
