DSK arrived at the Sofitel on the evening of May Ir. At 7:13 PM, after checking in, he used 
his newly-issued electronic key to enter the presidential suite on the 28h floor. The suite had been 
prepared for him earlier in the afternoon and the maid on duty O.Y. Fong, had turned down the 
bed at 5:47 PM. Then, at 6:13 PM, just as DSK's plane was landing at the airport, a person 
entered the suite using the electronic key belonging to a Sofitel employee named A.C. 
Chowdhury. 
The hotel's personnel records, however, show that Chowdhury was not working 
that evening, If so, an unknown person had used an employee's ID to gain entry. At 6:54 PM, 
there was another unidentified entry by a person using the generic "HK I " key, kept in the house 
keeping department. This key does not identify the individual. 
The Mystery of the Double Entry 
A maid cannot clean a hotel room without the cleaning equipment on her cart. For that reason, 
a maid normally takes a cart to the room she is about to clean, and leaves it parked outside the 
door of the room while she is cleaning it. On May 14ih, however, Diallo did not have her cart 
when she went to the Presidential suite after noon. It will be recalled that she had left it in the 
room on the other side of the elevator bank, room 2820, where it remained to 12:26 PM. Yet the 
key records show that Diallo had entered the presidential suite not once but twice within a minute 
at 12:06 PM. 1 She entered the first time, according to her account, because a room service waiter 
told her it was empty Since the electronic key records do not record seconds, we do not know 
how much time she spent on her first visit or how much time she spent in the hall afterwards. 
The room service waiter, Sayed Haque, who had entered it only a minute or less before her first 
entry, may possibly have still been in the suite. He told prosecutors he had entered the suite to 
remove the breakfast dishes. These dishes were in the dining room at the far end of the suite.. 
(See Diagram A). Wherever Haque was at 12:06 PM, Diallo did not remain long on that first 
entry. It is also possible that she met someone else outside the suite between her first and second 
visit. 
If she still intended to clean the room, she needed her cart of cleaning equipment. But she did 
not get that equipment. Instead, she returned to the presidential suite without it again. Whatever 
reason she had for returning to the room, she did so without the means to clean it. 
The Mystery of Room 2820 
If the prosecutors had been given the key records on Mayl 4th, Room 2820 might have been 
less of a mystery. It would then have been made part of the crime scene. As such, it would have 
been processed for fingerprints, DNA, and other possible evidence, and an effort would have been 
made to identify who was in it. The reason it was not so processed, as the prosecutors state in a 
footnote to their report, was that Diallo initially was untruthful to the police, as well as the 
prosecutors and Grand Jury, about her presence in room 2820. It was not until late June that the 
prosecutors found out that Diallo had gone into 2820, and, by that time, the room had been rented 
out many times, and it was too late to find evidence. Prosecutors found her concealment of her 
presence "inexplicable." In doing so, she prevented the police from searching 2820. 
It was 
not only Diallo who did not provide the authorities with this information about room 2820. The 
hotel staff could have ascertained from the computerized records that Diallo had used her key to 
enter 2820 four times that day, including once after her encounter with DSK.
