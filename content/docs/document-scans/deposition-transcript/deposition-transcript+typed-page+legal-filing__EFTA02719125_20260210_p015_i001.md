at risk beca=se it deprives them of the benefit that virtually every worker in all 50 Unite= States is guaranteed by law, 
Worker's Compensation Insurance which pays=for all medical care if they get hurt on the job. Worker's compensation 
pays 10=%, just like the coaches and the guys selling peanuts in the grandstands. So why no= the student athletes who 
have the most dangerous jobs or are the most likel= to get injured? 
Many student athletes end up paying the universities that they played for as a result of the injuries sustained while 
playing for their sa=e university. This truly seems a little odd but no accident because the term student athlete was 
created by the NCAA in the 1950s in an effort to not ha=e to pay Worker's Compensation after a football player in 
Colorado was ac=ually killed during a game, and when his family pressed the school for the same survivor benefits that 
they gave their employees, the NCAA said that he was='t an employee at all. And invented a new term, student athlete. 
A term that helped give them the control of an employer without the obligations. This m=ve saved the NCAA an untold 
fortune because new research shows that former NCA= athletes often suffer physical ailments for the rest of their lives. 
An Indiana =niversity study last year found that half of them will have chronic injuries by their early 50s, a rate twice that 
of non-athletes. When you suffers spine, back or neck injury you are not just going to be out for the rest of the season. 
You are potentially going to be debilitated for the rest of your life. You are going to be restricted in your career 
opportunities. It can resul= in a catastrophic illnesses that you will carry for the rest of your life. Some injured student 
athlet=s are so debilitated (especially in football but also includes soccer, diving, swimming, water p=1o, hockey, track & 
field, eitc.) that they are prohibited from working by their doctors or even driving. They are often in such bad shape that 
the Federal Government labels them as 'leg=lly disabled' and a ward of the state with their medical bills and living 
e=penses paid by taxpayers. 
More disturbing is that because schools don't cover injur=es a number of critics believe that they are not doing the 
things normal employe=s would do to prevent injuries, which means that athletes are not just on the hook for their 
medical bills but are more likely to get injured to begin with. The whole point of Workman's Comp was to recognize that 
we want employers who are benefiting from the activit=es of their employees to bare the costs of their injuries and to 
try to take s=eps to reduce the risk of injuries. The biggest problem here is that they don&#=93 have very much 
incentive to reduce those injuries. 
These student athletes go to =allege hoping to enhance their earning potential and instead for far too many it has been 
just the opposit=. Many of these injured athletes are unable to sit or work on their feet for sustained periods making it 
impossible for th=m to do office work, work as drivers or become police officers or firemen...AO When actual 
employees get hurt on the job and lose earning potential Workmen Comp makes up most of the difference so they don't 
lose money. But since student athletes are not considered employees, they are on their own. And to add in=ult to injury 
the schools seen to not care. Few injured student athletes ever hear from their coaches or schools after leav=ng. 
Something is wrong.
