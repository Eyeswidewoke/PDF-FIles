You did not say yes, just like you did not say that although you promised to have a baby, you never 
'wanted to have one with me". Just like you promised to always take care of me and just like I never 
had to worry, just like you would always be honest...

I am sorry but you are delusional. 
I am very much in love with you. I also decided not to take the lies and abuse anymore. I watched. 
I watched how you treat other girls when they do the same or less than I do and then compared it 
to the nasty comments, hurtful jokes, embarrassing remarks in front of others, no kind words, thank 
you, hugs or smiles. It is sad. And it was the 'girls' that created tension to begin with. I am sure 
there are no arguments when you are alone. None of the bimbos are worth arguing with and your 
employees wouldn't dare say a word to
 no matter how you behave. 
I don't know what transition you are referring to. I told you in October we should think about a 
transition if you want to brake up. If thats what you want to do, then please stop masking it by 
telling me you just need a break before July, leading me on ( and wasting my youth :) 
Thank You
