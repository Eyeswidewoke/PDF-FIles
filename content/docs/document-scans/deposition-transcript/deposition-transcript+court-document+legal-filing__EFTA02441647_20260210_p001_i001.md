Anna-
You were just great tonight. You looked sensational and were totally charming, amusing and a great sport. I though Dave 
was very generous and supportive of the film showing a clip that made you want to see the film. I watched the show with 
my 21 year old niece and we both laughed and loved the segment... 
I assume RJ and/or Patrick told you about the two screenings we worked on this weekend. 
The most interesting aspect of the Nantucket screening on Friday, which was packed with 100 excited movie fans, was that 
they all got dressed up for the screening as if you were actually going to evaluate their outfits from the screen. Upscale 
couples from Boston, Conn. and New York brought their 70/80 year old mothers and 1 6/ 18 year old teenagers too. The 
film plays to three generations. Everyone just adored the film. 
Saturday night was the Hampton's screening in a private screening mom in a home attended by 110 younger. hipper 
fashionistas....some of the chic girls you usually photograph and live in the Hamptons for the summer. Grace and RJ came 
for the cocktails before the film...and again the film played to an extremely enthusiastic audience. Many came over to The 
Blue Parrot restaurant after to tell RJ how much they loved the film and what they liked best. (Andre's tennis scene is a 
favorite.) Calvin Klein came and loved the film as well. 
If you want the guest lists from both screening, we can send...and the press coverage. 
I arranged for RJ to stay at my friends boat house on Georgia' Pond for the weekend. I stayed in the main house. The wife 
of the owner. Jill Davis was a writer for Letterman for 8 years and her friend Maria Pope. EVP of the show (who pre-
interviewed you) came over Sunday and talked to RJ about your appearance. Such a small world. 
I also took RJ to Ronald Perelman's for lunch Sunday with Harvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman. After we 
congratulated Harvey on the S40 million weekend for "Inglourious Basterd" we talked about "Sept" all afternoon 
and 
Sunday night RJ went to yet another screening we did of "Taking Woodstock," where he met Ang Lee...and many other 
filmmakers. So. we both worked/networked/spread the word all weekend on the film and your behalf. 
My impression from the three screenings this week is that "The Sept. Issue" will be a big hit. There is a hugh international 
market for fashion films after "Devil" and "Valentino"....although RJ said "Valentino" did not perfonn as well in the 
suburbs. As you probably know, Roadside Attractions is making an effort to play mainstream theaters....not art houses. 
So congratualtions on a job well done. You are so compelling, smart and a sensational roll model in the film.
