only to be a young woman of slight build and soft demeanor. The following is an excerpt 
from the investigator's report detailing her extremely short but none the less pungent 
statements; 
"11.21.2005, my partner, S 
and I traveled to Orange Park 
(Jacksonville), Florida, in order to attempt to interview
 The purpose of 
havin two people present was to act as witnesses as to whatever might have been said by 
during the course of our interview. IM lives with her 18 year old boyfriend, 
and his mother and boyfriend at  
 At 
approximately 6:30pmlillarrived home. We waited about 10 minutes and approached 
the residence. I knocked on the door and a woman, who 1 now know as 
answered the door. I told her that we would like to speak with 
She said 
there was no 
there. I said there must be because her Jeep was parked out 
front. She then said, "I'm sorry, you mean = 
and I said yes. = 
then came to the 
door. The following conversation took place. 
my name is 
(as I handed her my business card) and this is my 
partner 
. We are investigators from Miami working on behalf of Jeffrey 
Epstein. 
I don't talk to fucking cops and I'm not talking to you. 
we're not cops. 
You need to leave. Get the fuck off my property, leave now. 
= 
there is no need to be hostile. We are not cops. We are just trying to learn 
the truth. 
Get the fuck off my property. What, you're still standing here?

We're leaving but we don't understand why you're so hostile. 
You have no right to be here. I moved. All that shit is behind me in another

came outside on the porch 
Ma'am we're not being hostile. We're here just to learn the truth. 
Look, III is a good girl and she left down there. We're trying to sort things 
now and hire her an attorney. 
I understand but we're not the bad guys and we're not cops. 
Okay, but she doesn't want to talk with you and you really have no right being 
ere on my property this time of night. 
I'm sorry we're here at 6:45pm but your son, M 
told us we could come back. 
He doesn't own this property. 
came back outside 
You're still here, get the fuck out. I'm calling the cops if you do not leave. 
III 
we're talking with 
and yes, we're leaving, but all we wanted was to 
earn t e truth from you about what knowledge you may or may not have." 
As you can gather from this, we believe her to be the source of your concern. 
Our other, but we believe, less likely alternative source for the potential 
misunderstanding could be a close friend of
