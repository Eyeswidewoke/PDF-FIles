CALL TO ACTION 
Late Friday afternoon the United States Attorney's office of the Northern District of Iowa filed their 
sentencing memorandum with the court and in it asked that the Court should impose a sentence 
consistent with the "guideline range calculated by the U.S. Probation Office." The Probation office 
calculated the total offense level at 45; but since the Sentencing Table caps at level 43, the 
Probation office calculated the total offense level at 43. An offense level of 43 provides for a life 
sentence under the sentencing guidelines. 
Most Jews in America today truly want to believe that Anti-Semitism is not really a problem in this 
country. We talk about the growing Anti-Semitism in Europe, in countries like France and England. 
Most responsible Jewish leaders are so afraid to use those two dirty words. They say "we can't 
prove it and we have to stop with the victim mentality". Sorry to break the news to you , Anti-
Semitism is alive and well in the United States of America . 
Prosecutors just came out with their official recommendation to the court in the sentencing of 
Sholom Rubashkin and they are asking for a sentence of Life In Prison. Those unfamiliar with the 
case might think this is a murder case, a child rape case or a case involving a repeat violent 
offender. Wrong again. This is the case of a Chasidic Jew who is a first time nonviolent offender. 
His crime submitting false reports to the bank regarding the security for the bank's loan which 
ultimately caused the bank to lose 27 million dollars. 
No one is condoning his criminal behavior. No one is above the law. If you commit the crime you 
have to do the time, however the punishment has to fit the crime. In addition, every case is 
different and the details and circumstances of the crime and the purpose and scope of the crime 
have to be part of the punishment equation. Even the prosecutors agree that Mr. Rubashkin did not 
gain personally from this crime and that the only reason why he committed the crime was to try to 
save his fathers business from going under after the govemment decimated the company with an 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid. 
To put the sentence being sought in the Rubashkin case in perspective, one can look at the case of 
Mark Turckan, the president of a St. Louis bank, pleaded guilty in early 2009 to a 21-year cover-up 
of misapplying funds. He was found to have caused a 25-million dollar loss, the prosecutors asked 
for a 63 to 78-month sentence, and he was sentenced in a Missouri federal court in June 2009 to 
one year and a day in prison! 
So you may be wondering why is it that the government is asking for life in prison in this case ? The 
answer unfortunately is the two words no one wants to hear: Anti-Semitism. Of course it is a lot 
more complicated and detailed and no one called anyone a dirty Jew or painted a swastika so of 
course there is no proof. However no one needs swastika's to know that Mr. Rubashkin is being 
treated differently because he is a Chasidic Jew living in LA.
