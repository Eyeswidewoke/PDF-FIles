It was a &=uot;material" event. Samsung is, in Steve's words, "our n=w biggest competitor". Microsoft 
depends on hardware and only two =ompanies that make hardware are executing--apple and Samsung. Lenovo st=als 
windows and all the others from hp to dell to asus are betting on andr=id big. 
I don't think I have been flip flopping or erratic.= I have been frustrated at jays lack of engagement after 
the New York me=ting. I think this is just like your frustration with his worries. = have no worries not closing but 
dragging it out isn't good for anyone=since everything that happens in public changes the negotiation. Even Wind=ws 
Blue(next release) gives Steve more confidence he doesn't need to s=gns this. 
His second concern is me stealing people. That's=why he wants a gag order. 
The only tool they =ave is money or suing me. Suing me is hard but hardly impossible. Th= only variable 
is that suing me means a deposition for Steve. But if th=y don't sue me then they have to sue everyone who leaves with 
me. T=at they don't prefer. 
I think: 
• $15m to me is fair and reasonabl= since it was comp i earned modulo the proxy bullshit which drops 
125,000 =r so shares. For negotiation more than happy to say "plus 5m cash&quo=;. I don't care about the timeline. Id 
set up an automatic escro= account so I don't have to go back to them. 
• Not working at apple, google until 2014 is fine 
=95 Cooperating and not poaching is fine 
• The timeline doesn't matter so long as ja= is driving and not letting brad stall. That's new since jay is 
draggi=g now. 
I can say yes to Samsung with an agreement. If we don't have an=agreement I will get sued going to 
Samsung. They know it and i know it.= If not then tell me why not? 
I think they shou=d agree not to sue other microsoft people who leave to the same company as=me. 
That's new. That's added because of the way they structu=ed the gag order. If I can't talk to them about stuff then i 
can t=;t be recruiting them. If i go to Samsung they can't now declare th=t a competitor because of me. People can quit 
and join other companies.=
