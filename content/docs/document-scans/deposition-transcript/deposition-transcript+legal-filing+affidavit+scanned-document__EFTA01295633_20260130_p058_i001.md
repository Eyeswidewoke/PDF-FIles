"substantial" disparities, we cannot be confident that a challenged policy produced an 
injury common to the class. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. 
As to the disparate treatment claim, "gross statistical disparities" "may in a proper case 
constitute prima fade proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination." Hazelwood Sch. 
Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 307-08, 97 S. Ct. 2736, 53 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1977); 
accord Ardrey v. United Parcel Serv., 798 F.2d 679, 683 (4th Cir. 1986) . But see Warren 
v. Halstead Indus., Inc., 802 F.2d 746, 753 (4th Cir. 1986) ("[S]tatistics cannot alone prove 
the existence of a pattern or practice ("98] of discrimination [.]"). But not every case will 
present the truly egregious and unexplained disparities that leave no room for any 
inference other than intentional discrimination. Moreover, "[i]nferring past discrimination 
from statistics alone assumes the most dubious of conclusions: that the true measure of 
racial equality is always to be found in numeric proportionality." Md. Trooper Ass'n, Inc. v. 
Evans, 993 F.2d 1072, 1077 (4th Cir. 1993).

The majority observes that Plaintiffs' evidence is "statistically significant at 2.54 standard 
deviations from what would be expected if race were a neutral factor." Maj . op. at 28. 
Statistical significance, however, is a necessary but not sufficient condition to finding a 
discriminatory practice or policy; statistical significance does not axiomatically equate with 
legal significance. [" 935] See EEOC v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Richmond, 698 F.2d 633, 
648 (4th Cir. 1983) (" [S]tatistical significance as measured by the standards of acceptable 
statistical principles will not necessarily be legally significant[.]"), rev'd sub nom on other 
grounds, Cooper v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S. 867, 104 S. Ct. 2794, 81 L. 
Ed. 2d 718 (1984). High statistical significance levels might lack practical and legal 
significance, for instance, because "a high significance level may be a misleading artifact 
of the study's design." Kadas v. MCI Systemhouse Corp., 255 F.3d 359, 362 (7th Cir. 
2001) . Thus, determining what is legally significant -- as opposed to statistically significant 
["99] -- "is a legal determination properly made by the court and not by an expert." Fed. 
Reserve Bank of Richmond, 698 F.2d at 648; cf. United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 
449 F. Supp. 2d 1, 706 n.29 (D.D.C. 2006) (criticizing one of Plaintiffs' experts for his 
undue reliance on statistical significance). 
Nevertheless, the majority seems to defer to Plaintiffs' experts and assume legal 
significance because the statistical evidence crosses the two-standard-deviation threshold, 
the threshold for statistical significance at a 95% confidence level. Yet "courts of law 
should be extremely cautious in drawing any conclusions from standard deviations in the 
range of one to three." EEOC v. Am. Nat'l Bank, 652 F.2d 1176, 1192 (4th Cir. 1981); see 
also Kingsley R. Browne, Statistical Proof of Discrimination: Beyond "Damned Lies", 68 
Wash. L. Rev. 477, 503 (1993) ("Random disparities of this magnitude are pervasive in the 
workplace and are not suggestive of a nonrandom cause, let alone an illegal one."). In 
specific cases, even higher numbers may not be enough. EEOC v. Western Electric Co., 
Inc., 713 F.2d 1011 (4th Cir. 1983), provides one example. There, we held that a district 
court clearly erred in finding a policy or practice of discrimination, even though statistics 
showed overall disparities of 4.7955 and 5.883 standard deviations. Id. at 1018-19.
