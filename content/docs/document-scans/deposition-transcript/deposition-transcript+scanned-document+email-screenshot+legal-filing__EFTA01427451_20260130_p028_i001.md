The Industry Where We Operate: Large and Attractive 
Pet food is one of the largest CPG categories in the United States. We 
estimate the U.S. pet food industry had approximately $26 
billion in retail sales in 2014. According to Euromonitor, the pet food 
industry had $49 billion in additional retail sales outside the United 
States in 2014, bringing the total size of the global pet food industry to 
over $75 billion. 
U.S. pet food retail sales grew 62% between 2004 and 2014, which represents 
a CAGR of 5%, based on data from Euromonitor. The 
industry growth over this period has been fueled by the "humanization" of 
pets, as pets are increasingly regarded as family members. This 
humanization trend has led pet parents to increasingly evaluate pet foods in 
the same way they scrutinize their own food choices. As more pet 
parents seek better, more wholesome options for themselves, they also seek 
these types of options for their pets. As a result, a significant 
number of pet parents have demonstrated a willingness to pay a premium for 
pet food that they believe will enhance the well-being of their 
pets. The higher demand for natural food products and more specialized 
formulas for different life-stages, breed sizes, special needs and diet 
types has fueled premiumization in the industry, leading to the faster 
growth of products with higher revenue per pound. This premiumization 
trend has impacted all market segments and product types in the pet food 
industry. 
The pet food industry has high penetration in the United States with 63% of 
households purchasing pet food in 2014. Virtually all 
pets in the United States are fed packaged pet foods. The continued growth 
of the industry through the worst economic recession in recent 
history is a testament to the underlying consumer demand and the strength of 
the consumer trends driving it. Pet food is also a highly branded 
industry with low rates of switching due, in part, to potential digestive 
issues that may occur when switching between different pet food 
brands. As a result, brands that build a strong relationship with a pet and 
its pet parents realize significant value over the lifetime of the pet, 
especially if the pet starts on the brand as a puppy or kitten. 
We believe the Wholesome Natural and Therapeutic market segments are 
particularly on trend as pet parents increasingly treat their 
pets like family. With market shares of 17% and 7%, these two market 
segments have become significant parts of the U.S. pet food market, 
and continue to grow faster than the rest of the market. 
In 2014, specialty channels accounted for 45% of U.S. pet food sales, with 
the Food-Drug-Mass, or FDM, channel accounting for the 
other 55%. Specialty channels include a diverse set of retailers with over 
20,000 stores (which includes national pet superstore chains (i.e., 
PetSmart and Petco), regional pet store chains (e.g., Pet Supplies Plus, Pet 
Supermarket, Petsense and Pet Valu), neighborhood pet stores, farm 
and feed stores (e.g., Tractor Supply Company and Mid-States), eCommerce 
retailers (e.g., Amazon, Chewy and Petflow, as well as websites 
of major retailers), military outlets and hardware stores) and 25,000 
veterinary clinics. BLUE is sold across all types of specialty channel
