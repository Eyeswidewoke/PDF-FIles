The Associated Press (11/05, Tucker) reported that a federal judge on Wednesday ordered prosecutors in the 
criminal case of former FBI Director James Comey to produce to defense lawyers a trove of materials from the 
investigation, saying he was concerned the DOJ's position had been to "indict first" and investigate second. 
According to the article, US Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick instructed prosecutors to produce by the end of 
the day on Thursday grand jury materials and other evidence that investigators seized during the investigation. The 
order followed arguments in which Comey's attorneys said they were at a disadvantage because they had not been 
able to yet review information that was collected years ago as part of an investigation into FBI media leaks. The 
article noted that Comey is charged with lying to Congress in 2020 in a case filed days after President Donald Trump 
appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies. 
Comey has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued that it's a vindictive prosecution brought at the 
direction of the Republican president and must be dismissed. Fitzpatrick raised his own concerns, telling lawyers on 
Wednesday, "The procedural posture of this case is highly unusual." The article pointed out that Comey's defense 
lawyers had already asked for a transcript of grand jury proceedings, citing irregularities in the process and 
potential legal and factual errors that they said could result in the dismissal of the case. Fitzpatrick on Wednesday 
ordered prosecutors to produce grand jury materials and also directed them to give defense lawyers evidence 
seized through search warrants in 2019 and 2020 from Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and 
close friend of Comey. The article explained that Comey's indictment came days after Trump in a social media post 
called on AG Bondi to take action against Comey and other longtime foes of the president. The indictment was 
brought by Lindsey Halligan, a former White House aide and Trump lawyer who was installed as US attorney after 
the longtime prosecutor who had been overseeing the investigation resigned under administration pressure to 
indict Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The DOJ in court papers earlier this week defended the 
president's social media post, contending it reflects "legitimate prosecutorial motive" and is no basis to dismiss the 
indictment. CBS News (11/05, Rosen) clarified that evidence at issue Wednesday is troves of data that the DOJ 
gathered between 2019 and 2020 in a past DOJ investigation during the first Trump administration known as "Arctic 
Haze." The New York Times (11/05, Vigdor) revealed that a Florida man was arrested on Wednesday in connection 
with a series of online threats against several of Trump's most prominent political adversaries, according to a 
criminal complaint, which said that his targets included Comey, James and Hunter Biden. Two of the posts 
appeared within a few weeks of the recent indictments of Comey and James. The man, Gregory Formicone, 58, of 
Bradenton, Fla., could face up to five years in prison if he is found guilty of making the threats, which an FBI special 
agent said in the criminal complaint had appeared on Disqus, a hosting service for online comments. NBC

Continued Reporting: Rick Scott Demands Answers From Verizon About Coughing up Phone Records for 
`Arctic Frost' Probe 
The Washington Times (11/05, Bell) reported that Sen. Rick Scott is demanding answers from Verizon about the 
telecom giant's decision to release cellphone data after revelations that the Biden DO1 spied on Republican 
lawmakers as part of its "Arctic Frost" investigation. According to the article, he said these questions are not only 
for himself, but on behalf of the millions of Americans "who believe their data is safe with Verizon." The article 
stated that Scott learned that his data was targeted and that Verizon failed to notify him or make any effort to 
protect his data from the "Arctic Frost" probe, which targeted President Trump and Republicans after Trump 
challenged the 2020 election results. In a letter to Verizon on Tuesday, the senator demanded the company explain 
why it did not file a motion to quash a subpoena for his phone records and what disciplinary measures were taken 
against those complicit in releasing data. He gave the company a Nov. 17 deadline to respond. The article explained 
that details of "Arctic Frost," which was approved by former AG Merrick Garland and former FBI Director 
Christopher A. Wray, were revealed in recently declassified DO1 documents. The broad criminal investigation 
targeted Trump, Republican lawmakers and Republican groups. Breitbart (11/05, Mastrangelo) added that Rep.
