ongoing FBI corruption probe will spread into California's governing and lobbying circles. According to the articles, the FBI, which is required by 
law to notify people after they have been surveilled, helped build a case alleging that Williamson lied to FBI agents about her role in steering a 
high•proflle harassment lawsuit against Activision Blizzard toward a settlement, and Newsom said he placed her on leave as soon as his office 
learned a year ago that there was an FBI investigation into her. The articles further reported that Williamson has pleaded not guilty, McClusIde 
and Campbell have been charged with related crimes and are expected to plead guilty, and Becem — who is running for governor — is not 
accused of wrongdoing but faces questions about why he failed to detect the misuse of his campaign funds, even as his spokesman says he 
cooperated with the Justice Department. The articles noted that the case has exposed long•running concerns about abuse of power and revolving• 
door influence in Sacramento, with critics blaming Newsom and other Democratic leaders for enabling Williamson's behavior, while some 
strategists caution against rushing to Judgment and point out that no one has yet been found guilty. 
Director Patel, Homeland Security's Noem Attend Las Vegas Grand Prix 
Reuters (11/22, Carroll) reported that Director Patel and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem attended the Las Vegas Grand Prix, appearing 
on the red carpet with Formula One's CEO before touring the paddock and McLaren's garage. According to the article, Noem praised the event and 
emphasized secure attendance, while Director Patel said he was an Fl fan who supports McLaren but may consider Cadillac when the American 
team joins next year. The article noted that security at major Las Vegas events has been heightened since the 2017 mass shooting, and that the 
race drew numerous celebrities including Beyonck, jarZ, and Cynthia Erivo. 
Continued Reporting: Director Patel Under Scrutiny for Use of SWAT Teams to Protect Ills Girlfriend 
The New York Times (11/23, Feuer, Goldman, Thrush) reported that Director Patel ordered SWAT agents to protect his girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, 
at multiple events — including the NRA convention in Atlanta — prompting internal concerns about his use of bureau resources. According to the 
article, Director Patel also used government aircraft for personal trips, deployed tactical teams on short notice to guard Wilkins in several cities, 
and faced criticism from current and former FBI officials who said such use of SWAT operators was highly unusual and potentially improper. The 
article highlighted that Director Patel's spokesperson defended the security measures by citing hundreds of threats against Wilkins. "Ms. Wilkins 
is receiving a protective detail because she has faced hundreds of credible death threats related to her relationship with Director Patel," said FBI 
spokesman Ben Williamson, adding, Thad faith criticisms of FBI travel will not deter the bureau from our mission." The Independent (11/23, 
Keane) and People (11/23, Richards) also reported on the story. 
The FBI Spied on a Signal Group Chat of Immigration Activists, Records Reveal 
The Guardian (11/21, Levin) reported that the FBI accessed a private, encrypted Signal group chat used by New York immigratlon•rights activists 
who organize "courtwatch" efforts, quoting messages in an August 2025 Joint FBI-NYPD report that labeled the participants "anarchist violent 
extremist actors." In its memo, the FBI claimed the information came from a "sensitive source with excellent access" and summarized discussions 
about monitoring federal immigration courts, collecting media of law enforcement officers, and entering courtrooms, though the report did not 
explain how the bureau obtained access to the encrypted chat According to the article, the FBI asserted that the group's organizer had previously 
used private encrypted chats to instruct protest participants to use violence, yet the memo offered no evidence for these claims and contained no 
references to bomb•making or other crimes that an NYPD spokesperson later cited when defending the broader investigation. The article 
reported that activists, civil•liberties experts, and officials such as New York City comptroller Brad Lander condemned the FBI surveillance as an 
intimidation tactic, comparing it to past FBI abuses including spying on civil•rights leaders and Muslim communities, and warning that such 
undercover monitoring chills lawful First Amendment activity. The article noted that the FBI declined to answer questions about the surveillance, 
leaving unclear whether the bureau still has access to the private group, while DHS and Justice Department officials defended broader 
immigration•enforcement priorities even as critics argued that federal agencies are increasingly criminalizing constitutionally protected speech 
and court•watching activities. Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Independent (11/21, Scott), MSNBC (11/21, Jones), New 
Republic (11/21, Rashid), New York Daily News (11/21, Crane•Newman, Rayman, Sommerfeldt), SAN (11/21, Marshall), and Wired (11/21, 
Cameron, Couts). 
A Swath of Bank Customer Data Was Hacked. The FBI Is Investigating. 
The New York Times (11/22, Copeland, Cowley, Barrett) reported that SitusAMC, a major vendor used by hundreds of banks, confirmed it was 
hacked on Nov. 12, potentially exposing sensitive residential mortgage data belonging to clients of institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, CM, and 
Morgan Stanley. According to the article, SitusAMC notified law enforcement of the breach and said it was still analyzing which data was affected, 
prompting heightened concern because the company holds extensive personal and nonpublic financial information, including Social Security 
numbers and details about banks' internal real estate risk The article noted that the incident raised particular alarm on Wall Street given the 
scale of data involved and the possibility that the breach exposed not only customer information but also confidential details about the banks 
themselves. Director Patel said in a statement: "While we are working closely with affected organizations and our partners to understand the 
extent of potential impact, we have identified no operational impact to banking services." Additional reporting on the story was provided by 
Bloomberg (11/23, Bleiberg), CNN (11/22, Lyngaas, Perez), and Reuters (11/22, Nair).
