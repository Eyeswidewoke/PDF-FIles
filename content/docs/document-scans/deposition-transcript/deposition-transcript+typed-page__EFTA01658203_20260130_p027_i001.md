News reports on the President's briefing on the state of the coronavirus pandemic cast him as 
changing his tone on the gravity of the situation - a development a number of stories attributed 
to his deteriorating poll numbers, and for which he received little credit across most of the 
coverage. To the Washington Post (7/21, Olorunnipa, 14.2M), for example, Trump's "low-key 
reappearance before reporters seemed to be a tacit admission that his previous strategy had 
not worked" and "the virus he once said would soon disappear continues to pose a grave threat 
to the country, as well as to his reelection." Yet he "continued to showcase his trademark 
boosterism with repeated praise of his administration." Politico (7/21, Forgey, 4.29M) similarly 
casts him as "seeking to repair a damaging media narrative as coronavirus infections spiral 
back out of control just over 100 days before the presidential election." 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (7/21, story 3, 2:50, O'Donnell, 4.49M) reported that Trump 
"acknowledged voters will judge him on his leadership in the handling of the pandemic," adding 
"that may explain why the President changed his tone." CBS (Jiang) showed him saying, "It will, 
probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better." USA Today (7/21, Subramanian, Fritze, 
10.31M) notes the President added, "Something I don't like saying about things, but that's the 
way it is." ABC World News TonightVi (7/21, story 3, 3:00, Bruce, 7.14M), meanwhile, showed 
Trump saying, "We're asking everybody that, when you are not able to socially distance, wear a 
mask, get a mask, whether you like the mask or not. They have an impact. They'll have an 
effect, and we need everything we can get." 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/21, lead story, 3:00, Holt, 6.23M) similarly spoke of "a remarkable 
change of tune for...Trump," who "made an unqualified call for mask-wearing, as well as voicing 
support for more testing." NBC (Welker) added that "under pressure," Trump held "his first 
briefing on the coronavirus since April, touting progress fighting COVID-19." Said the President, 
"The vaccines are coming, and they're coming a lot sooner than anyone thought possible, by 
years." The AP (7/21, Miller, Lemire) recounts that "besides declaring support for masks as a 
way to fight the pandemic, he admonished young people against crowding bars and spreading 
the disease." 
Along those lines, Reuters (7/21, Alper, Mason) referred to "a shift in rhetoric" on Trump's 
part, the Washington Examiner (7/21, Smith, 448K) says his "comments marked a shift in tone 
for the president who has, for some time, had a more positive perspective on the state of the 
pandemic," Fox News (7/21, O'Reilly, 27.59M) that he "admitted that the public health crisis is 
likely to worsen" and Politico (7/21, Oprysko, 4.29M) that he "diverged from his upbeat and 
dismissive rhetoric about the threat of coronavirus" and exercised "discipline as he read largely 
from a script and acknowledging the real scope of the virus as cases and fatalities climb to 
record levels across the country." The AP (7/21, Miller, Lemire) reports "there were no 
guarantees how long Trump's more measured tone, delivered with an eye to halting a 
campaign-season erosion of support, would last," as "along the way Tuesday, the president still 
worked in jabs at the news media and Democrats for focusing on disease-fighting shortcomings 
in the US." 
To the Washington Times (7/21, Howell, 492K), meanwhile, Trump "tried to seize control 
of the coronavirus narrative Tuesday," and "said Americans are far less likely to die from the 
disease than they had been in March and April, citing the younger age of new infections and 
pioneering drugs, but he admitted there was work to do as cases and hospitalizations surge in 
the South and West." The Los Angeles Times (7/21, Stokols, 4.64M) recounts, however, that 
"moments later...Trump responded to a question without notes and delivered his familiar 
refrain: eventually 'the virus will disappear:" Along those lines, the New York limes (7/21, 
Baker, 18.61M) reports "the president's shift had its limits," as "he again congratulated himself 
on his handling of the pandemic, admitted no missteps and made a number of specious claims." 
The Hill (7/21, Chalfant, 2.98M), CNBC (7/21, Lovelace, 3.62M), Breitbart (7/21, Spiering, 
673K), Townhall (7/21, Pavlich, 177K) and Wall Street Journal (7/21, Lucey, Restuccia, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M), among other news outlets, also cover the briefing.
