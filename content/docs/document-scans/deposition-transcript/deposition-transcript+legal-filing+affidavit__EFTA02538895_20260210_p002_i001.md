was advise= in no uncertain terms to having nothing to do with you, and not to speak =r email you, and if I did, I would 
cause more problems to both You and The=Duke and myself. So I shut down and ran away. I was broken and lost. 
So=please understand, as I do about you, that I ws broken and not the strong =erson you know, and I got completely 
obliterated too, and I saw all my chi=drens work etc disappearing.. I shut down and everyone out. I was frighten=d. The 
Palace system is frightening, and each step I turned or each action=was wrong and I did not want to hurt Andrew one 
more time. 
So Jeffrey, this email is sent with a hope you accept, and understand a lit=le of my side too. 
We are and have both been in the firing line, both blamed for stuff we have=not done, this front line attack has 
been like this for me for 22 years. Y=u would have thought I was thick skinned enough to handle it. I know there=are 2 
sides to every story, I have heard yours, please hear mine. 
I am glad you spoke to James, and James made you aware from the British med=a standpoint, that all this 
hellaciousness had been going on many days =EFORE my statement. And I was instructed to act with the uptmost speed, 
fr=m most sides, if I was to have any chance at all holding onto my career as=a childrens book author etc and a childrens 
philanthropist, and I got terr=fied. I should have taken advice from you too, before speaking to Geordie,=and taken a day 
or two to think of the ramifications of my actions, but =A0for the reasons as stated above, I was in over riding fear. I am 
sorr=. I just did not know what or where to turn. 
I know James can send you every single article from the days, weeks, lea=ing up to that Monday of the 
statement from the endless horrendous page= written about You and The Duke. So you can see why I became paralysed. 
I know you and James are going to work on a solution. 
In the meantime, I write this from the truth of my heart.
