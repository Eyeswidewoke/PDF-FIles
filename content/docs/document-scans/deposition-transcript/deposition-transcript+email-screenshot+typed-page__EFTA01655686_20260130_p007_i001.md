New York Detective Did Jobs for the Mafia on the Side, Prosecutors Say 
The New York Times (02/25, Nerkar) reported that more than a decade ago, a Nassau County detective burst into a 
nondescript shoe repair store on Long Island, flanked by colleagues intent on shutting down a backroom gambling 
operation controlled by the Genovese crime family. Federal prosecutors say the detective, Hector Rosario, Sl, was 
not on police business when he raided Sal's Shoe Repair in Merrick, N.Y. Nor were the men who joined him officers 
— prosecutors called them "associates." The detective, prosecutors say, was secretly on the payroll of the rival 
Bonanno crime family, and the raid was intended to make his second boss happy. According to the article, Rosario, 
51, was indicted in 2022 along with eight other defendants after a yearslong investigation into the Genovese and 
Bonanno families' illegal gambling businesses. The eight other defendants have all pleaded guilty to charges that 
include racketeering and running illegal gambling businesses. Rosario is charged with obstruction of justice and 
lying to FBI agents who were investigating the illicit businesses, including the one prosecutors say he raided. He has 
pleaded not guilty. On Tuesday, opening statements began in his criminal trial before Judge Eric N. Vitaliano of U.S. 
District Court in Brooklyn. The article mentioned that Anna Karamigios, a federal prosecutor, said Rosario was on 
the Bonanno family payroll while he was a Nassau County detective. "He chose the crime family over the public he 
swore to protect," she said. "When FBI agents asked him what he knew, he lied. Again and again." Organized crime 
families like the Bonanno and Genovese once exerted considerable power over unions and industries such as 
construction in the Northeast. But starting in the 1980s, aggressive prosecutions sapped their power, and the 
Bonanno family saw members convicted or cooperate with the government. Even the family's longtime boss, 
Joseph C. Massino, defected: In 2011, he became the first boss of an organized crime family to cooperate with 
federal authorities. The New York Post (02/25, Catalini, Schnitzer, Troutman), and New York Daily News (02/25, 
Annese) also reported on the story. 
Alleged Cocaine Quality Control Tester for Mexican Drug Cartel Extradited to U.S. 
Fox News (02/2S, Casiano) reported that a Mexican woman responsible for testing the quality of cocaine being 
trafficked by a drug cartel has been extradited to the United States and charged by federal prosecutors. Irma Elvira 
Cruz, known as "Huzipol" and "Madre," 60, was indicted earlier this month on federal charges of conspiracy to 
unlawfully import cocaine into the United States and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Cruz was an 
associate of an unnamed drug trafficking organization in Mexico and was allegedly responsible for the quality 
control testing of cocaine transported from Colombia to Costa Rica and Mexico, with the intent of being smuggled 
into the U.S., authorities said. A DOJ press release noted that this effort is part of an Organized Crime Drug 
Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) operation. OCDETF identifies and eliminates the highest-level criminal 
organizations that threaten the United States using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach. 
Numerous Victims Say They Lost Everything in Timeshare Purchasing Scam With Phony Business Address 
CBS News (02/25, Kozlov) reported that timeshares can go from creating happy memories to causing big headaches 
— especially if an owner wants out. That is where scammers come in — promising owners they can sell the 
timeshares at a profit, but pocketing all the cash. In August 2022, CBS News Chicago reported on an elaborate 
Chicago-focused scam in which a man lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Since then, dozens more have come 
forward saying the same happened to them. The victims' life savings, homes, and pensions were all gone — given 
to people claiming to work for a firm called Intercontinental Realty, which called the victims with a promise to sell 
their timeshares in Mexico for a profit. "The scam is the same," said private investigator Joe McGreal. "So they'll 
offer a large amount of money — a $1 million profit, a $2 million profit — just to hook them and reel them in. Once 
they're reeled in, they start charging them fees." According to the article, McGreal has been tracking the scam for 
three years. He began investigating after the victim whom CBS News Chicago talked with for the 2022 story hired 
him to get his $300,000 back from the same company. "The dozen clients that I represent, there's everywhere from 
$500,000 loss to $1.3 million," said McGreal. "The total is over $4 million — $4.3 million, give or take." The article 
stated that McGreal called the FBI, offering practically to hand the agents his case file. "The agencies involved with 
enforcing these laws are not doing anything about it," said McGreal. The FBI was one example of such an agency, 
he said. "The FBI was contacted by half a dozen clients in half a dozen states. They were informed to file a 
complaint on their website. They did that," McGreal said. "Haven't heard back in two years." The article noted that 
an FBI spokesperson said the agency cannot confirm any ongoing investigation, but did say timeshare scams like 
these are on the rise. According to the FBI, the proceeds of many of the scams go straight to help fund Mexican 
cartels.
