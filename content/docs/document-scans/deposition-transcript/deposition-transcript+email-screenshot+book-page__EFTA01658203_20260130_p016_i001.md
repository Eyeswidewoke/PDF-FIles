the ground that US protections for individual rights are not `adequate.' It manages to do this 
while acknowledging that the court and the EU have no authority to elaborate or enforce these 
rights against any of the EU's member states. ... The judges of the CJEU declare that large 
chunks of US intelligence law - such as Section 702 of FISA - are beyond the pale." He 
concludes, "The US should ask for the concessions it should have gotten last time: a binding 
assurance that US protections for individual rights are not in need of European editing and that 
data flows will never be threatened again over this issue." 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
FBI Probing Links Between Attacks On New Jersey Federal Judge, California Attorney. 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (7/21, story 5, 2:15, O'Donnell, 4.49M) reported, "Tonight, 
investigators say the man who allegedly targeted a federal judge in New Jersey is the prime 
suspect in a California murder eight days ago, and officials say the gun used in the suspect's 
suicide was the same gun in the attack that killed Judge Esther Salas's son and injured her 
husband." CBS (Oliver) added, "Tonight, authorities believe the killer was Roy Den Hollander. 
Sources say he posed as a FedEx delivery man and opened fire in broad daylight at the door of 
New Jersey federal judge Esther Salas. Den Hollander was found dead in a car from a self-
inflicted gunshot wound a day later. Investigators believe the gun recovered where he died 
matches not only the one used in the New Jersey murder, but is now being tested to see if it 
was used in the California shooting." 
ABC World News TonightVi (7/21, story 5, 1:40, Muir, 7.14M) reported, "Tonight, 
authorities uncovering disturbing twists as they investigate the attack on New Jersey federal 
judge Esther Salas's family that left her only son dead and husband in the hospital. Law 
enforcement sources revealing suspect Roy Den Hollander is also being investigated in the 
killing of Marc Angelucci this month in California." ABC (Ramos) added, "Sources say the 
gunman in Angelucci's killing was dressed similarly to Den Hollander, wearing a FedEx uniform, 
when police say he opened fire on Salas's 20-year-old son Daniel and husband Mark Anderl on 
Sunday. A 2015 case in which Den Hollander, a lawyer and self-described anti-feminist, 
represented the plaintiff was presided over by Judge Salas before another lawyer took over in 
June 2019. The names of a dozen others were found in his car, including New York state chief 
judge Janet DiFiore." 
Fox News (7/21, Gearty, 27.59M) reports, "The San Bernardino Sheriff's office was 
investigating Angelucci's murder without identifying a suspect, but the investigation is now in 
the hands of the FBI, sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Mauricio Hurtado told Fox News Monday. `The 
FBI asked to see certain things in our case to see if it's linked to their case,' he said." 
The AP (7/21, Balsamo, Dazio) reports, "Angelucci, like Den Hollander, was involved in 
lawsuits alleging gender discrimination against men. He was shot to death July 11 at his home 
in San Bernardino County, California. The official cautioned the investigation was in its early 
stages and federal officials were working with local homicide detectives. In both cases, the 
suspect appeared to pose as a delivery driver, the official said." Investigators "are also 
examining Den Hollander's financial and travel records, as well as misogynistic screeds he 
posted online, said the official, who could not discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and 
spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity." 
The Los Angeles Times (7/21, 4.64M) reports, "FBI investigators are examining Den 
Hollander's travel records and finances in the weeks before the deadly incident Sunday. His 
body was found in Sullivan County, N.Y., late Sunday. A package addressed to Salas was 
recovered with Den Hollander, along with another for a New York judge." 
NJ News (7/21, Attrino, 1.72M) reports, "Salas was the judge in a 2015 lawsuit Den 
Hollander filed in federal court claiming the Selective Service System, which requires men to
