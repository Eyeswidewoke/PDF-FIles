everyone wears a beeper.) Gates spends at least two hours a day at his desk staring into his monitor, reading and writing 
E-mail. E-mail allows Gates to run the company in his head, in a sense. While he is working, he rocks. Whether =he is in 
business meetings, on airplanes, or listening to a speech, his =upper body rocks down to an almost forty-five-degree 
angle, rocks back =up, rocks down again. His elbows are often folded together, resting in =his crotch. He rocks at 
different levels of intensity according to his =mood. Sometimes people who are in the meetings begin to rock with him. 
el think it's just excess energy," Gates said to me about his rocking. ="I should stop, but I haven't yet. They claim I 
started at an extremely =young age. I had a rocking horse and they used to put me to sleep on my =rocking horse, and I 
think that addicted me." 
Gates does not have the physical charisma of, say, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Computer. Like Lenin, Gates leads 
by sheer force of intellect. He looks like a teen-ager, but not because he actually looks younger than thirty-eight. In some 
ways, he looks older--a very old little boy. It is the oddly undeveloped quality in his pale, freckled face that makes him 
seem boyish. His hair is brown and =is almost always uncombed. He has heavy lips, which contort into odd shapes when 
he talks. His characteristic pose when he is standing is pelvis pushed forward slightly, one arm wrapped around his body, 
the other arm occasionally going up into the air as he talks--kind of flying up, almost spastically, with the palm 
outstretched, then settling again somewhere on his chest. His voice is toneless, with a somewhat weary note of 
enthusiasm permanently etched into it, and his vocabulary is bland: "stuff" is "cool," "neat," "crummy," "super," 
"supercool." 
When Gates was in his twenties, his mother color-coordinated his clothes--he had green days, beige days, blue days--
and then the job was taken over by girlfriends, and now it will presumably fall to his wife, but so far no one has really 
handled the task successfully. "A lot of his friends have said, 'Bill, come on, let's go on a shopping spree, we'll buy you 
some clothes,' but it never =works," Ann Winblad, who is now a highly respected venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, and 
was the woman in Bill's life for five years, told =me. "Bill just doesn't think about clothes. And his hygiene is not good. 
And his glasses--how can he see out of them? But Bill's attitude is: I'm in this pure mind state, and clothes and hygiene 
are last on the list." Esther Dyson, who edits a computer-industry newletter called Release 1.0., says, "I'm told that 
within Microsoft certain people are =allowed to take Bill's glasses off and wipe them, but I've never done it. You know, 
it's like--'Don't try this at home.' " 
Gates is famously confrontational. If he strongly disagrees with what you're saying, he is in the habit of blurting out, 
="That's the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard!" People tell stories of Gates spraying saliva into the face of some 
hapless employee =as he yells, "This stuff isn't hard! I could do this stuff in a weekend!" What you're supposed to do in a 
situation like this, as in encounters with grizzly bears, is stand your ground: if you flee, the bear will think you're game 
and will pursue you, and you can't outrun a =bear. I had a chance to try this approach one day in Gates' office, when I 
made a remark to him about Microsoft's antitrust problems, and he got mad at me. I had mentioned the theory that 
Anne Bingaman, who is the head of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, would not =have taken the 
highly unusual and public action of requesting the Microsoft file from the Federal Trade Commission, which had pursued 
a three-year investigation of Microsoft, if she had not felt she could make a good case against the company. (In the end, 
the F.T.C. did not file any charges.) All the soft planes in Gates' face contorted into an =expression of pure sarcasm. "I 
think you're a little confused," he said. "You're saying that before they read even a single piece of paper they =judge 
what kind of case they have?" He choked slightly on his disgust for my stupidity. "I think you're confused," he said again. 
"The Justice Department chose to get the information to decide what to do. Saying they have a pretty good case before 
they've read anything--is that how =these things work?" Going by the book, I answered that someone at the F.T.C. could 
have told someone in the Justice Department that the case =against Microsoft was strong. This seemed to make the 
situation worse. ="Look," Gates said. "The Department of Justice is looking at these files. You know? It's justice? You're 
supposed to have facts before you =decide things?" I felt a trickle of sweat run down my back. 
All the executives directly under Gates are male, and almost all are in their mid-thirties. Nathan Mhyrvold, thirty-four, 
=who as a graduate student at Cambridge University interpreted for Stephen Hawking, is in charge of new technology. 
Steve Ballmer, thirty-seven, who is Gates' best friend, runs the numbers side of the business. He and Gates met during 
freshman year at Harvard, when they lived down the hall from each other. Cramming together for an advanced-
economics exam was a determining event in their relationship. =Ballmer acted this scene out for me, pacing around the
