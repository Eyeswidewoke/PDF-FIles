ABC World News TonightVi (10/19, story 6, 1:25, Muir, 7.31M) reported Russian opposition 
leader Alexei Navalny delivered "a defiant warning tonight and a message for President Trump." 
ABC's Ian Pannell said Navalny was critical of Trump "for not joining world leaders in 
condemning the attack" on him. On NBC Nightly NewsVi (10/19, story 9, 1:30, 5.28M), Keir 
Simmons reported Navalny is demanding Trump "condemn his attempted assassination by, he 
claims, Russian President Vladimir Putin's people." Navalny: "I think it's extremely important 
that everyone, of course, including and maybe in the first of all, the President of United States, 
to be very against using chemical weapons in the 21st century." 
Retirees Demonstrate Against Lukashenko In Belarus. 
The AP (10/19) reports that for the third straight Monday, "about 3,000 retirees rallied in the 
Belarusian capital of Minsk...to demand the resignation of authoritarian President Alexander 
Lukashenko as mass protests of a disputed election continue to roil the country." In the wake of 
Aug. 9 voting that was "widely seen as rigged," retirees "marched through the streets of Minsk 
carrying flowers and chanting for Lukashenko tolGo away!" The AP Adds that some 2,000 "pro-
Lukashenko pensioners also rallied in the capital." A Wall Street Journal (10/19, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M) editorial cites the unrest in Belarus as evidence of Russian President 
Vladimir Putin's declining influence in the former Soviet Republics. 
Armenian, Azeri Leaders Both Say They Would Meet In Moscow For Peace Talks. 
Reuters (10/19, Bagirova, liovhannisyan) reports that on Monday, "a new ceasefire in the 
mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh was in jeopardy...with Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian 
forces reporting shelling and heavy fighting." According to Reuters, "The ceasefire was agreed 
on Saturday after an earlier deal brokered by Russia failed to halt the deadliest clashes in the 
South Caucasus since the 1990s." Reuters says that "so far, the main driver of diplomacy 
between the ex-Soviet enemies has been Russia." Reuters adds that Armenia's Prime Minister 
Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev "both told Russia's TASS news agency 
in separate interviews on Monday that they were ready to come to Moscow for talks." 
Morales Ally Triumphs In Bolivian Presidential Election. 
The AP (10/19, Valdez) reports that former Bolivian President Evo Morales' party "has claimed 
victory in a presidential election that appears to sharply shift Bolivia away from the 
conservative policies of the U.S.-backed interim government that took power after the leftist 
leader resigned and fled the country a year ago." According to the AP, "The leading rival of 
Morales's handpicked successor, Luis Arce, conceded defeat on Monday, as did interim President 
Jeanine Aliez, a bitter foe of Morales." The AP says Bolivian officials "released no formal, 
comprehensive quick count of results from Sunday's vote, but two independent surveys of 
selected polling places showed Arce with a lead of roughly 20 percentage points over his closest 
rival - far more than needed to avoid a runoff." The New York Times (10/19, Turkewitz, 
18.61M) says Bolivia's "voters appear to have spoken clearly: They want [Morales'] socialist 
project to go on." The Washington Post (10/19, Machicao, Faiola, 14.2M) and Reuters (10/19, 
Rochabrun, Ramos) provide similar coverage.

The AP (10/19, Peck, Blake) reports Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's government on 
Monday sought to quell growing protests "calling for the prime minister to resign by threatening 
to censor news coverage, raiding a publishing house and attempting to block the Telegram 
messaging app used by demonstrators." The Washington Post (10/19, Mahtani, Wangkiat, 
14.2M) says "young, digitally savvy Thai protesters...are at the forefront of a swelling anti-
government movement that has broken the mold in Thailand - both by shattering the long-held
