Consuming Cities 
Faculty: Salmon. Scott

10:00 AM 11:40 AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 5953 Sec A 
This course offers a global perspective on the changing character of cities and the increasing 
importance that consumption and consumer culture plays in the construction of urban life. 
Consumption has become both a means and motor of social change: an active ingredient in the 
construction of space and place: and in constructing subjectivity and social selfhood. Cities are 
simultaneously being restructured as engines of consumption - providing the contexts in which 
goods and services are marketed, compared, purchased, used, and displayed -just as they are 
themselves increasingly being commodifled and. in a very real sense, consumed. Increasingly. 
forms of spectacle have come to shape how cities are imagined and to influence their character 
and the practices through which we know them from advertising and the selling of real estate, to 
popular music and youth cultures, to the regeneration of urban areas under the guise of the 
heritage and tourist industries. Using examples of cities such as New York. Sydney. Barcelona. Rio 
de Janeiro. Toronto, London, and Johannesburg this course explores how image and practice have 
become entangled in the mutual and dynamic relationship between urban development and 
consumption. <div>This course is open to all Bachelor Level Students.<rdiv>
