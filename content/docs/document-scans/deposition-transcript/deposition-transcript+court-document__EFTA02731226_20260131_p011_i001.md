an escort service when she was about 18 years o .

only went on dates and did not engage in sex acts wit any clients during her time at the escort

admitted that she had engaged in paid 
sex acts during her time at the escort service.

as a prostitute and she did not want to admit todoing so in a room full of hostile men during her

the FBI,

up about Maxwell just so she can testify in our case.
