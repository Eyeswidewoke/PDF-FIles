Given a black tu=edo by his father, he started playing gigs when in high school. He enjoyed listening to Herb Pomeroy's 
band at the time, and had a trio that playe= Horace Silver's music at a local jazz club. He eventually decided to move to 
N=w York City, where he studied musical education for one month at Columbia Universi=y and six months at Juilliard. 
He quit after finding both disappointing, but liked the atmosphere of New York, and=the music scene became the 
starting point for his professional career. 
He picked up imp=rtant experience playing with the bands of Mongo Santamaria and Willie Bobo (1962-1963), Blue 
Mitchell (1964-1966)= Herbie Mann, and Stan Getz. He made his recording debut as a leader with 1966's Tones for 
Joan's Bones, and=his 1968 trio release (with Mirosla= Vitous and Roy Haynes) Now He Sings, Now He Sobs is considered 
a classic. After a short stint w=th Sarah Vaughan, Corea joined Miles Davis as Herbie Hancock's gradual replacement, 
staying wit= Davis during a very important transitional period (1968-1970). He was persuaded by the trumpeter to start 
playing electric piano, and was on =uch significant albums as Filles de Kilimanjaro, In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, and 
Miles Davis at the F=Ilmore. When he left Davis, Corea at first chose to play avant-garde acoustic jazz in Circle, a quartet 
with Anthony Braxton, D=ve Holland, and Barry Altschul. But at the end of 1971, he changed directions again. 
Leaving Circle, =orea played briefly with Stan Getz and then formed Return to Forever, which started out as a melodic 
Brazilian group wi=h Stanley Clarke, Joe Farrell, Airto, and Flora Purim. Within a year, C=rea (with Clarke, Bill Co=nors, 
and Lenny White) had changed Return to Forever into a pace-setting and high-powered fusion b=nd; Al DiMeola took 
Connors' place in 1974. While the music was rock-oriented, it still retained the improvisations of jazz, =nd Corea 
remained quite recognizable, even under the barrage of electronics.=C2* When RTF broke up in the late '70s, Corea 
retained the name for some big-band dates with Clarke. During the nex= few years, he generally emphasized his 
acoustic playing and appeared in a wide variety of contexts, including separate duet tours with Gary Burton and Herbie 
Hancock, a quarte= with Michael Brecker, trios with Miroslav Vitous and Roy Haynes, tributes t= Thelonious Monk, and 
even some classical music. 
In 1985, Chick Corea formed a new fusion group, the E=ektric Band, which eventually featured bassist John Patitucci, 
guitarist Frank Gambale, saxophonist Eric Marienthal, and drummer Dave Weckl. To balance ou= his music, he formed 
his Akoustic Trio with Patitucci and Weckl a few years later. When Patitucci went out on his own in the early '90s, the 
person=el changed, but Corea continued leading stimulating groups (including a quartet with Patitucci and Bob Berg). 
During 1996-1997, Corea toured with an all-star quintet (includin= Kenny Garrett and Wallace Roney) that played 
modern versions of Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk compositions. He remains an important =orce in modern jazz, and 
every phase of his development has been well documented on records. 
Solo Piano: Originals -- Corea began the 21st century by releasin= a pair of solo piano records, Solo Piano: Originals and 
Solo Piano: Standards, in 2000, followed by Past, Present & Futures in 2001. Rendezvous in New York appeared in 2003, 
followed by To the Stars in 2004. The Ultimate Adventure was released in 2006. That same year, Corea released Super
