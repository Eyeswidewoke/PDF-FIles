MR. EDWARDS: Okay. We had an issue come up 
3 
where everybody that represents Mr. Epstein decided 
4 
to chime in on a certain issue. And I know that 
5 
that was an isolated incident. I am assuming that 
6 
everybody realizes, you know, the rules here and 
7 
you have chosen your examiner, and that's going to 
8 
be the person speaking for Mr. Epstein, or on his 
9 
behalf for the reminder of the deposition. We're 
10 
not going to get double or tripled teamed. 
11 
MR. CRITTON: I get -- let me speak to that. 
12 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 
13 
MR. CRIITON: You have got five lawyers, five 
14 
to seven lawyers here on Plaintiffs on every 
15 
deposition that i have attended- I have had five 
16 
separate Plaintiff groups that all chime in on, on 
17 
everything. We arc not impacted in the deposition 
18 
with your client at all, i.e., we're not chiming in 
19 
to question her at all. 
20 
What we are is Mr. Goldberger has certain 
21 
information that I am unaware of, so he deals, 
22 
dealt only with the objection. It was a 
23 
lawyer-to-lawyer issue. There are certain 
24 
information that I have that Mr. Luttier does not 
25 
have. So that's again a lawyer-to-lawyer issue
