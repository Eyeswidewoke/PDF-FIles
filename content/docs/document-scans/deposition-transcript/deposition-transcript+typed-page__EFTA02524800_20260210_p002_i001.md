Update of the Last 10 Years 
=A0 
D=ring the last 5 years of our fight with the government, because of Landmark's high quality environmental 
record, Landmark was invited by the=20 European Union to develop the last great sand dune on the west coast of 
Ireland. We developed, on a fee basis, the Doonbeg Golf Club, which when it was opened, was rated by Golf Digest 
Because of the time spent in Ireland, we were approached to do a development in the south of Spain, where we did 
Arcos Ga=dens, chosen by some as the best new course built that year in the world and chosen by most to be the best 
new course in Spain in many years. We also developed, on a fee and carrie= ownership interest basis, Lake Presidential 
in Maryland, 14 miles due east =f the U.S. capital, and moved our corporate headquarters to Maryland. 
=A0 
A=though it was agreed that Landmark had contributed $131 million net value to the bank in 1982, and that the 
government, without cause, violated=20 their contract, Landmark received only $21 million from the Court of Claims. By 
the time it paid its lawyers, court costs, and its debt of honor to directors, etc., it had approximately $4 million net 
remaining. In 2004 we purchased South Padre Island, our joint venture with the =loyd Bentsen family in South Texas, 
from the fund run by Lewie Ranieri, and on a friendly basis, separated our relationship w=th Lewie. In 2006 we invested 
$4 million to purchase one-third of Apes Hill Club, Barbados. 
=A0 
South Padre Island proved a success in that we sold approximately 150 houses in 2005, 200 in 2=06, 170 in 2007, 
and in each of these years had cash flow of $3 million to $5=20 million net to the parent. We have developed 
approximately half of the 2,000 acres, have 1,000 homes built, an= approximately 1,200 left to be built. After Lloyd 
Bentsen's death, we bought from his estate, at a very=20 attractive price, his interest, and it is now owned 100% by 
Landmark. 
=A0 
S=uth Padre Island Development is on the right side of history in that it offers good value, in warm weather. on 
the water for middle-class pre-retirement, retirement buyers, however, with the housing crisis we only=sold 21 houses 
in 2008 and are doing only slightly better than that in 2009. Therefore, the cash flow is not coming from South Padre to 
Landmark, but cash is going from Landmark to South Padre. Recently there was some sign of optimism, but in the short 
run, this may be a false spring. In the long run, I am confident that offering homes in a good golf course community 
from $135,000 up will be in =he heart of the baby boomers retirement plan. 
=A0 
A=es Hill Club is 470 acres that overlooks both the west coast of the Caribbean and the east cost of the Atlantic. 
It has been the most successful and highest quality development I have ever be=n associated with. While at the present 
time, with the pound low against the dollar and the financial crisi= in England and Ireland at its zenith, our sales are 
slow, last year Apes Hill Club made $33 millio= net profit. However, because the cash flow was needed for continued 
development in Apes Hill, none of the money w=s brought back to Landmark. 
=A0 
O=viously, if we have a completely integrated management staff and presently no income from our two major 
developments, we have a cash flow problem. A year ago I believed that recession was on us, things would be bad, and 
Landmark would be (if I could=keep the team together) in an ideal position to take advantage of the greatest=20 
financial crisis in my lifetime. Therefore, I made the decision not to cut management back to what wa= necessary for
