Special request 
Hello my dear friend, 
As William Shakespeare said (The hardest battle in your life is wh=n people push you to be another person ). I have 
always been a career orien=ed person and a goal achiever, but I also spent a lot of time finding my tr=e self...and I am 
still on that journey trying to develop that side of me h=wever now I do it with lots fun. I will never let anyone distract 
me or swa= me away from that path. 
As I told you, I am now finally back to my normal routines, fully passionate=and focused on my 
company hoping 
my baby can become financially inde=endent, consequently giving me full financial security and stability elimin=ting the 
need to think of finding a job ever again. 
A friend of mine believes in me and my capabilities. He thinks I never had t=e opportunity to be in the right position 
even though I've had acce=s to the right circle of people. Further more he believes that I have an ad=antage being a 
female publisher, a rare phenomenon in the global 
ind=stry and non existant in the region. Another advantage is 
my background in t=e Telecom industry, where I was ranked one of the top 50 strongest women in=Middle East. 
According to my friend this gives me a competitive edge and makes his work e=sier. 
This is why he is willing to arrange meetings with whomever is interested in=the 
business in the region. By the 
way recently Saudi and Emirati go=ernments created 
I am targeting them. 
This is why currently I am spending most of my time preparing all the docume=ts to attract both governments and new 
investors that will help me build th= biggest mobile game company in the region. 
Which brings me to you my dear friend. I am seeking your advise from an inve=tor's point view. I would really appreciate 
if you humbly become my=advisor helping me achieve my goals, I am sure, I will learn a lot from you=. I know you don't 
usually give business advice for small sized com=any, it is probably not attractive and up to your level. However honestly 
y=u are the only person that I know from that caliber that already was humble=enough to listen to me, open up to me 
and support me considering your busy a=d hectic schedule. 
I am approaching you personally and asking of you such a task because I know=you religiously value friendships. I also 
believe 1 am one of your good loy=l friends. 
I will be great-full, if you accept this challenge and advise a very small b=dwin business owner with 0.1°!
genes. I will gladly fly to you and=share all the documents that I am producing for my future investors. 
If you don't have the time and you don't like the idea, plea=e please please just ignore the email, I am very 
understanding and will act=as if this email was never written and sent to you, as agreed I will visit i= minimum two 
months :-) 
I appreciate the time you took out of your busy schedule to read this length= request. 
Regards,
