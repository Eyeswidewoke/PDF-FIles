Universe: ficePhysical experiments have found no solids, no continuous surfaces or linesironly discontinuous constellations of 
individual events. An aggregate of finites is finite. Therefore, universe as experientially defined, including both the physical 
and metaphysical, is finite.ii" 
Universe: a description. AceAll physics one tautology; / If you describe things with the right tensors / All law becomes the fact 
that they can be described with them; / This is the Assumption of the description.A Assumption of the description: 
decrcation of the thing described. Assumption of the description: the compulsion to assume the existence of an entity. By 
decreating we invent the existing entity; invent the unnecessary unit in a language; invent history; invent universe; invent 
reality, nature, etc. The decreation of the thing described compels us to assume the description of the thing described. 
Activity is undifferentiable: the names, the signs of distinction, the descriptions, are a consequence of the event, the coupling 
operation. ficeProgress so far has consisted not so much in specifying what is actually observed, as in eliminating what is 
definitely unobserved and unobservablea": the assumption of the description: decreation of the thing described. ficeWe 
approach a society / Without a society.fi 
AceMost men find the final dissolution of the universe as distasteful a thought as the dissolution of their own personality, and 
manâTMs strivings after personal immortality have their macroscopic counterpart in these more sophisticated strivings after an 
imperishable universe.ri The universe is finite: there is nothing beyond, nothing outside this finiteness. Just the next 
measurement, the next word. 
No explanation, no solution, but consideration of the question. AceEvery proposition proposing a fact must in its complete 
analysis propose the general character of the universe required for the fact"' The description, the proposition: not a 
definition, but a commission. aceUnderstanding a commission means: knowing what one has got to do.aRO 
ficeThc final truth about a phenomenon resides in the mathematical description of it. We go beyond the mathematical formula 
at our own risk; we may find a model or picture helps us to understand it, but we have no right to expect this and our failure 
to find such a model or picture need not indicate that either our reasoning or our knowledge is at fault.A9-1 The description is 
the thing: AceDescription is revelation. It is not / The thing described, nor false facsimile12 Nothing to describe. 
Intention embarrasses. liceEvery phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning. / Every poem an epitaph. And any 
action / Is a step to the block.a9J Hope? But ficehope would be hope for the wrong thing.ii`n Love? But ficelove would be love 
of the wrong thing.ii Stopping or starting: intention embarrasses. 
Names: the description is the thing; the word must be the thing it represents; the most important thing is the next word. 
Getting through the history of words: Throw away the lights, the definitions, / And say of what you see in the dark / That it is 
this or that it is that / But do not use the rotted names: mind, space, time, people, place, life, death, world. 
Awkwardness: the only way to bear so much reality. Camouflage: the only way to live on the sophisticated edge of 
awareness. Confusion: the only way to live with the trivia of daily life. 
Fact: doing. Fact: events. No nature at an instant. Activity: the matter of fact. aceThe exquisite environment of fact. The final
