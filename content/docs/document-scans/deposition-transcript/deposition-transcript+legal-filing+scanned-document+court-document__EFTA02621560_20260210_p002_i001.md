An Investigation by the University of Professor Krauss' behavior at ASU has not substantiate= 
any violations of University policy warranting dismissal or further sanctions against Professor Krauss. None of his 
numerous students, faculty colleagues, or postdoctoral researcher that he has worked with during his ti=e at ASU at has 
issued any complaints against Prof. Krauss, nor were there complaints raised by any of the many participants in his 
Origins Project eve=ts over the past decade. Professor Krauss has made significant contributions to teaching, research, 
and public outreach at ASU over the pas= decade, during which he has helped significantly raised the public profile o= 
the Institution. As Director of Origins, he created a unique program t=at brought world class scientists, scholars, and 
celebrities to ASU to share th=ir insights, create new research programs and excited and educate the public ab=ut 
foundational questions of great relevance for dealing with the challenges of=the 21st century. As a Professor he helped 
build and create an outstanding research program in Cosmology at Asti, and his classes at Barrett=honors college has 
received positive reviews. Through his many efforts at public outreach, he has inspired individuals around the world to 
better appreciate the world around them. 
Nevertheless, ASU t=kes all allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and the University fulfilled 
all its legal obligations to investigate allegations of misconduct by acting promptly to ensure the safety of students, staff, 
and members of the general public following complaints originating with BuzzFeed magazine in February of this year. 
The University Office of Equity and Inclusion completed their investigation in July and determined that the =80 
preponderance of the evidence' available at the time of their Investigation suppor=ed an allegation of inapproriate 
touching of an individual during the taking=of a 'selfie' photograph at a Skeptics event in Australia in 2016. This 
i=divdival did not think the action warranted a complaint but an bystander&nb=p; thought otherwise and filed a 
complaint As a result ASU did not r=new Prof. Krauss' appointment as Director of the Origins Project and his endowed 
appointment a= Foundation Professor. Professor Krauss continues to defend his behavior and provided what he felt 
was new evi=ence for consideration by the University after the OH Investigation concluded. Hthe University has found it 
unnecessary to reopen their i=vestigation at this time.

For these reasons,=Professor Krauss' period of administrative leave is thus lifted effective 
immediately. <=span> 
Prof. Krauss=and the University have recognized that stories regarding this now widel= 
covered issue may persist independent of their possible verity= and y concluded that w Professor Krauss may be best 
off if he conventrated on of=his remaining, research, and service activities at another instistuio= . As a result, 
Professor Krauss and the University have agreed that:

(c) Following that=period, Professor Krauss will retire from his teaching and service 
responsibilities at the University on his 66th birthday. Professor Krauss and ASU have agreed on a mutually acceptable 
severan=e package that he will receive at that time. 
(d) At that time, P=ofessor Krauss will assume Emeritus status at ASU,
