market speaks. If EL IPO / C=H income isn't what I expect this year I would either sell or rent-it. I love the place but not 
going to put us in a bad place again over thi= apartment. 
2. There are other significant =ssets. This is what I was referring to as us sitting down to look at the 
w=ole picture. 1.2cash, 1.6M in equities, 2.7m in hedge funds, lm in Covis ,=m in commerical rent generating real estate 
in NC, 1.7m in multifamily tha= pays quarterly dividends, a basket of other assets and investments. These=are rough 
numbers off top of my head during break in meetings. I can get m=re detailed when not on my phone. Been in meetings 
all morning in FLL sine= 745. Establishment Labs is probably the biggest single investment and doi=g the best. The "they" 
is better in conversation. Not simp=e answer. I'll get you the details you asked when I get back. Thin= of it roughly like 
this. I paid 3.75/share. The current round is closing =t 16/share and IPO roughly 18.50. Can sell if we want 6month later. 
I have='t tried to sell my shares but if I wanted to I could have sold to=Perceptive Advisors at that price in last round. 
3. Yes it will to finish. I have this modeled out and can get you exa=t numbers when back to office. It will 
take about 75% of the remaining cas= from refinancing. 
4. Completely agree. This is m= biggest weakness in business and it's the most important. I will =et on 
this ASAP. 
5. I have spent a lot of time in=factory and with management team and employees. It's a good 
manage=ent team. Prior to investment and after. Also at trade shows with doctors =nd KOL's. The top KOL's has left 
Allergen and Mentor to EL= Also visited London Hospital Group that has most experience with EL. I ha=e spent time with 
Jeffries team as well many times. Michael Robinson Manag=ng Director of Healthcare Investment Banking and Benjamin 
Lorello Global H=ad of Investmwnt Banking are running point on IPO. They were the ones that=set the expected 
valuation and time table. Shooting for June right now. 
All the best,

only as a result of you ask=ng for my advice. I suggest the following. 1=C240 real numbers are 
needed. real market numbers. 4>=A0 ie put the apt on the markeet to see what bids you get.Q=A0 ? ex ask for 
10m . see what happens.Q=A0 2. re the only other main asset. establishment lab. - =the " they" that you refenced that 
prefer you not share nu=bers are not your advisors. . my understanding is =hat you have an overide on the 1st 
investment of 10 percent. and an=investment of lm. 
there have been multiple financi=gs in between and more to 
come. so . establish how many =hares you actually own now. how many total shares there are on=a diluted basis... 
valutation models mean little .. then ha=e someone do a comp on silmilar cos based in costra rica. .4>=A0 to 
detiremine possible future value. but frankly hihgly unlikely =n the next 18 months. , in the alternative m, ask to see 
how m=ch one of the others w0ould pay for your current positoin. . =C24> lm 5m? . then subrtract taxes on gain. 3. 
t=e new york apt. will also require more capital . as it always does. = 4. take some accounting courses and financila 
reporting class=s.. 5 its all about numbers. i see establishments PR is=geared towards hype and not substance.. its
