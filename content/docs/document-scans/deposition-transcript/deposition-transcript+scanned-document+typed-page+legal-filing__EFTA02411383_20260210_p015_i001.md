of complex structured products such as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) and, at worst, being less than 
impartial because of the fees they got from issuing CDOs. 
Now companies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch are back in the limelight. Every time they change 
the rating of a sovereign debt they move the markets. For a while the rules of the European Central Bank seemed 
to give enormous power to just one agency, Moody's. Had it downgraded Greece, the country's government bonds 
would not have been eligible for use as collateral for loans from the ECB. (The ECB eventually amended the rules 
to accept Greece's bonds, whatever their rating.) 
More recently the agencies have been accused of being too harsh, and even of being part of an Anglo-Saxon 
conspiracy to hold down the southern European nations. Countries have been outraged by downgrades. There has 
been talk of setting up a rival European rating agency. The agencies put up a vigorous defence, pointing to the 
good record of their ratings in predicting sovereign default rates. No country rated AAA, AA or A has gone on to 
default for 15 years. Nearly 98% of countries ranked AAA were still ranked either that or AA 15 years later. 
When Standard & Poor's downgraded Greece to junk status in April, David Beers, its head of sovereign ratings, 
put the move into perspective: "We provide an independent view that investors may or may not choose to 
consider. Ratings are one of many inputs that investors look at, and they are only one of many factors that may 
affect movements in the market." 
Mr Beers argues that people may be paying too much attention to maintaining the top AAA rating: "People's 
perceptions are that a downgrade from AAA means that minutes later you default, but in fact it means only a 
slight increase in default risk." But Pierre Cailleteau of Moody's says that "because of the crisis we have to define 
the boundary between AAA and AA ratings very clearly." The agency uses three concepts: economic and 
institutional strength, government financial strength and susceptibility to event risk. 
Mr Cailleteau says the key measure is not the debt-to-GDP ratio but the proportion of government revenues 
devoted to interest payments. Once that proportion exceeds 10%, keeping the AAA rating becomes more difficult. 
But the agency will not downgrade the country if the government is committed to decisive action to reduce the 
deficit. 
But what constitutes decisive action? In judging that, the rating agencies are bound to be drawn further into 
tricky political territory. For example, they will have to weigh the new British coalition's plans to deal with its 
deficit, and assess how far EU countries are likely to go in bailing out their indebted fellow members. One thing is 
certain: the agencies will be shot at from all sides.

THERE is an old joke about a stranger who asks a local for directions and gets the cheerful reply: "If I wanted to 
go there, I wouldn't start from here." That advice sums up the dilemma the developed countries face in dealing 
with their debt. They have accumulated a mountain of it at every level, from the personal to the corporate and 
the sovereign. As this special report has shown, this was encouraged by a legal system that sheltered debtors, a 
corporate and financial sector that used debt to boost its returns and a cultural change that made it more 
respectable.
