RE: Ty's project 
VERY surprised to hear the author is a girl! She did a good job describing 
'boy behavior'! I hope Ty will WRITE me something about it. Tomorrow I think I 
will try to compose an e-mail to him about it - addressed to YOU, so then you can 
print out a copy or have him read on your screen ??? Will that work? 
Yesterday we did the same adventure you did on your bikes in Aspen. We left the 
house to walk to supper and half way there a huge storm blew in from nowhere -
Cold with Hail! Randy ran home and got soaked - I stayed on somebody's porch to 
wait for him to come back with the car - My hero! Love mom

Thank you for this mom! I meant to answer you earlier. Appreciate the advise on 
getting the updated version. Not sure if you know but the author of the book is 
actually a GIRL! And she really did write it while in high school! Very 
interesting to know the background as well. She saw a friend of hers get beat up 
and was so mad over it (greasers vs socs) she went home and started writing. It 
is certainly geared more toward boys... I look forward to watching the movie next 
week. Will try to get ty to write a little blurb in preparation for his paper. Or 
like you said- even call and have a discussion on it. Ty is supposed to compare 
and contrast the book to the movie. Love you and appreciate you Delving in to all 
of this. Including reading the entire "report" on him and all the "jargon' !! 
I'm stuck at LGA waiting for thunderstorms to pass. I'm going to Detroit to hook 
up with Paula and then pick up the boys. 
Flight was supposed to leave at 2:39. 
It's now departing 6:50! Xo. Lesley
