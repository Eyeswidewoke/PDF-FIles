Subsequ=nt to that, Buzzfeed came back with the following: 
T=ank you for sending the email from Neil Turok. We have raised this 
with the=Perimeter Institute, which has clarified its position, as follows:c/=iv> 
0u=ing the event, a sexual harassment complaint was filed with the 
administrat=on against you. 
In 2012, as part of a formal review of its inter=al policies, the institute 
made a decision that you would not be invited to=return. 
=div class="">As you can see, the original claim by Buzzfeed, which they 
c=aimed was verified 'on the record' by Perimeter, was false.= I believe this final claim is false, and I would like 
confirmation fr=m you.. It may be a fine point, but I believe it is important. Origin=lly Michael informed me immediately 
after the event that there was a compla=nt of inappropriate communication with one of the staff, something I indica=ed 
then and reiterate now, I am not aware of at all, but be that as it may,=he informed me at the time by email that with no 
further communication with=that person, the matter was closed. Several years later I was invite= to give another public 
lecture but your outreach coordinator later rescind=d the invitation, although I was reimbursed for that. As you are 
awar=, I subsequently discussed this with Neil in Vancouver in that year, and in=uired about exactly what it was all 
about, and informed him that either a f=rmal procedure to resolve any issue in which I could participate and respon= 
might be appropriate, or the matter should be dropped. Neil said he would e=plore the matter, and neither he, nor 
anyone else, ever contacted me follow=ng that. I have never been informed of anything like Buzzfeed has cl=imed. 
Indeed I have been invited back to Perimeter for scientific meetings b= various colleagues in the intervening years. 
I am very concerned by this claim be=ow, for obvious reasons. First, the 
original Perimeter source provide= false and defamatory information to Buzzfeed, changing a story only after I=provided 
counter-evidence. Second, as you are aware Perimeter has nev=r contacted me about any such proviso in the interim. 
The only docume=t I ever received was in 2009 from michael assuring me the matter was close=, whatever it was. I 
would find it highly irregular if any formal pro=edure took place with such an outcome without my knowledge or 
without any the process, and without subsequently informing me. 
I expect the correct statement, if t=ere is one, is that there was a 
complaint from someone at Perimeter about i=appropriate communication at the final party or while being driven back 
to t=e hotel after it (for all I know it may have been about religious issues), a=d that 3 years later a decision was made by 
the outreach coordinator, perha=s in collaboration with others, not to invite me back at that time for a pu=lic lecture. 
Last, it could be of course that Buzzfeed has reiin=erpeted statements 
from Perimeter staff, but if a member of your staff made=the original false allegation to Buzzfeed (violating 
confidentiality in the=process I expect) I would like you to at least be aware of this and act acc=rdingly. 
Th=nks very much for your prompt and immediate attention to this 
request.
