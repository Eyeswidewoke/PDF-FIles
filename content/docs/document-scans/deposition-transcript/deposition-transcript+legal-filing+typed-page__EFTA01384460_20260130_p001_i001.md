Long-Term Asset Return Study: The Next Financial Crisis 
and capital flows encourages more crises, likely by virtue of it encouraging 
more cross border flows which tend to be less controllable by domestic 
authorities and more susceptible to reversing course. 
After WWI saw the first truly global financial crisis, we then saw the recovery 
of the 'roaring 20s'. However this soon made way for the 1930s global 
Depression and VVVVII. After the Second World War, we saw the calm before 
the more recent storm, as the Bretton Woods system heralded in a period of 
quiet and controlled global financial markets. We'll delve into more detail later 
as to why we had calm and then why we had the storm. 
Differences between DM and EM crises and shocks through history 
There are quite major differences between the DM and EM universe over our 
study. Emerging markets seemed to be in perpetual crisis between the 1930s 
and the end of the 1990s and are therefore off cycle relative to the DM trend. 
From the 1930s to the 1990s EM Sovereign defaults were plentiful. 
Figure 15 shows the same data for EM without the influence of Sovereign 
defaults and when compared to Figure 14 highlights that a lot of the 1930s-
end 1970s issue with EM was default. However since this point default risk has 
slowly fallen to ultra-low levels with FX devaluations and inflation taking over 
as the big theme in the 1980s and 1990s - a period where debt crises across 
the universe were commonplace. From this point on, even this has been less of 
an issue.

Fiat currencies the problem, but also allow the quick fix 
Although our analysis so far shows that the post Bretton Woods financial order 
has been more crisis and shock prone then the prior 25+ years, and also that 
seen through most of observable financial history, the reality is that the current 
period of fiat currencies also arguably allows a buffer against an even greater 
number of them. So a real double edged sword. Since 1971, the global 
financial system has completely broken its ties with precious metal currencies 
systems. Prior to this period the vast majority of countries were tied to 
precious metal currencies for all but rare and short periods away from them. 
Such forced discipline massively constrained the financial system and in 
particular made it very difficult to create credit in the same way we do in 
today's economy. It also made it very difficult for governments to run large 
budget or current account deficits. Any economic system tied to Gold left
