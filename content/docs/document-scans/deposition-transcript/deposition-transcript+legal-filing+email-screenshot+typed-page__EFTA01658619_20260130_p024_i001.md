Trump, USA Today (9/22, Subramanian, 10.31M) reports, "used his speech...to level a 
withering series of attacks against China," the Washington Times (9/22, Boyer, 492K) says he 
"accus[ed] Beijing of deceiving the world about the danger," and to Breitbart (9/22, 673K) he 
"berated China." 
The New York Times (9/22, Gladstone, 18.61M) says Trump "assailed China as the 
coronavirus villain Tuesday in a strongly worded United Nations speech, extolling his own 
actions in the pandemic and demanding that the global organization hold accountable `the 
nation which unleashed this plague onto the world.'" 
The CNBC (9/22, Macias, 3.62M) website quotes Trump as saying, "The Chinese 
government and the World Health Organization, which is virtually controlled by China, falsely 
declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Later, they falsely said 
people without symptoms would not spread the disease." 
Politico (9/22, Forgey, 4.29M) reports that Trump "accused China of allowing flights of 
infected people to leave the country in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak, as well as of 
spreading false information with the help of the World Health Organization." lie "also criticized 
China's environmental policies, accusing its government of allowing overfishing of foreign 
waters, dumping trash into the oceans and producing unacceptable levels of carbon emissions." 
Trump said, "Those who attack America's exceptional environmental record while ignoring 
China's rampant pollution are not interested in the environment. They only want to punish 
America, and I will not stand for it." 
The Los Angeles Times (9/22, Wilkinson, 4.64M) says Trump's "unusually harsh speech in 
a forum that typically sticks to diplomatic niceties had two audiences." He "not only was 
speaking to the global community, but also to American voters: Anti-China rhetoric has been 
central to his campaign efforts to deflect blame for his failings in handling the pandemic, as well 
as criticism about his responses to trade deficits, climate change and China's abysmal human 
rights record." 
Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the General Assembly later Tuesday. Reuters 
(9/22, Nichols, Holland) says the Chinese leader "struck a conciliatory tone...calling for 
enhanced cooperation over the pandemic and stressing that China had no intention of fighting 
`either a Cold War or a hot war with any country:" 
Bloomberg (9/22, Sink, Liu, 4.73M) reports Xi "rebutted Trump's claims without 
mentioning the US president by name," saying "the global fight against the virus `should not be 
politicized' and warned that `no country can gain from others' difficulties." The AP (9/22, 
Anthony, Klug) similarly says Xi "took oblique potshots at the United States and its foreign 
policies...cautioning...that the world must `not fall into the trap of a clash of civilizations." Xi is 
quoted as saying, "Major countries should act like major countries." Xi also "cast the fight 
against the virus as an important exercise in international cooperation, an opportunity to `join 
hands and be prepared to meet even more global challenges." The New York Post (9/22, Feis, 
4.57M) says Xi "shrugged off responsibility for his country's disastrous handling of the 
coronavirus." 
The New York Times (9/22, Gladstone, 18.61M) says, "Taken together, the speeches by 
the American and Chinese presidents...punctuated the growing schism between the two 
superpowers during Mr. Trump's first term." 
Pompeo: US Pushing Back Against Chinese Military Activities In South China Sea. 
In an interview with the Washington Times (9/22, Gertz, 492K), Secretary of State Pompeo 
says the US is "pushing back against stepped-up Chinese military activities near Taiwan and in 
the South China Sea as a means of deterring a conflict with Beijing." Asked about China's large-
scale military exercises near Taiwan in recent days, Pompeo said, "What we have done for 
decades is we have permitted the Chinese Communist Party to engage in threatening or 
disruptive behavior, whether that is predatory economic practices and the like, and they have 
continued to expand their capacity and their footprint." Pompeo added, "The biggest risk with
