One 14-year-old girl 
took to meet Epstein led police to start the investigation of him in March 
2005. A relative of the gir called to say she thought the child had recently engaged in sex with a Palm 
Beach man. The girl then got into a fight with a classmate who accused her of being a prostitute, and she 
couldn't explain why she had $300 in her purse. 
The girl gave police this account of her meeting with Epstein: 
She accompanied 
and a second girl to Epstein's house on a Sunday in February 2005. Once 
there, a woman she thought was Epstein's assistant told the girl to follow her upstairs to a room featuring 
a mural of a naked woman, several photographs of naked women on a shelf, a hot pink and green sofa 
and a massage table. 
She stripped to her bra and panties and gave him a massage. 
Epstein gave the 14-year-old $300 and she and the other girls left, she said. She said=

whose most recent known address is in North Carolina, has not been charged in the case. 
Palm Beach police often conducted surveillance of Epstein's home, and at Palm Beach International 
Airport to see if his private jet was there, so they would know when he was in town. Police also 
arranged repeatedly to receive his trash from Palm Beach sanitation workers, collecting papers with 
names and phone numbers, sex toys and female hygiene products. 
One note stated that a female could not come over at 7 p.m. because of soccer. Another said a girl had to 
work Sunday — "Monday after school?" And still another note contained the work hours of a girl, 
saying she leaves school at 11:30 a.m. and would come over the next day at 10:30 a.m. 
Only three months before the police department probe began, Epstein donated $90,000 to the department 
for the purchase of a firearms simulator, said Jane Stnider, town finance director. The purchase was 
never made. The money was returned to Epstein on Monday, she said.
