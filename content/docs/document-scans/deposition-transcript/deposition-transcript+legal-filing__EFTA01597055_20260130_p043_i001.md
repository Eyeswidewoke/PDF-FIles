For Your Record! 
By signing below and depositing cash or securities in my accounts, I acknowledge that I have read, understand and agree with the enclosed UBS Client 
Relationship Agreement, as well as the terms, conditions and disclosures in the enclosed Agreements and Disclosures booklet. 
Margin Agreement 
I acknowledge that when I use margin privileges, UBS will hold the 
securities in my Account as collateral against the amounts I borrow. I 
agree to keep sufficient positions and margin in my Account to meet any 
margin calls UBS may be required to issue. By signing below, I agree that 
the Margin Agreement in my Client Relationship Agreement applies to 
all of my accounts, including any accounts that I may open in the future. 
Note: UBS does not extend margin for certain types of accounts (e.g., 
IRA and ERISA Plan accounts, Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, 
403(b)(7) Accounts, UGMAILITMA Estate or 529 Plan Accounts). 
Likewise, I acknowledge and agree that certain securities in my account, 
including any account I may open in the future, may be loaned to UBS or 
to other persons or entities as described in the Margin Agreement.
