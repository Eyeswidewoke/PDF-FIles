Re: Hello 
Personal/Political bias is =ne thing (I still would exploit it any and every time on cross); this was =n obsession and directly 
relevant "Stop Trump." Also, the IG made cl=ar in his testimony Strzok told him McCabe was there. McCabe is anot=er 
real character. He denies this; but he also is irreconcilably at =dds with Comey on WSJ leak. Absolutely right that taking 
emails alon= is not fair; but I would point out that it is folks like Strzok and compa=y who have ruined many a 
businesman's life based exclusively on a twisted =eading of emails sold to a jury. Flynn is an interesting case. =1 believe I 
could have gotten his plea back for him in a second based on w=at has surfaced; but he decided to go a different way. 
But as to you= underlying point that there might well be something to go after with thes= guys, I hear you; but I have 
spent my whole career fighting bullies and c=ooked, unethical prosecutors. That will remain a guiding principle f=r me, 
whether the target is popular, hated, a complete jerk, guilty, etc.&=bsp; I am doing ok, thanks. I see you really follow 
this stuff. =
