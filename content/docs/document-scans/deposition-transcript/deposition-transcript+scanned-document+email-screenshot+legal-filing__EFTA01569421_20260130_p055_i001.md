GHISLAINE MAXWELL ACCT. 
For the Period 3/1/11 to 3/31/11 
Hedge fund redemptions are generally on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis 
but can sometimes be subject to a multi-year lockup before a redemption is 
permitted. For redemptions, there is generally 
a notification period that can be a long interval before the actual 
redemption date. Redemption proceeds are generally paid 3-5 business days 
after the final NAV is issued, but can be subject to a 
holdback of a portion of the proceeds until an annual audit of the Fund has 
been completed. Please refer to the applicable hedge fund's operative 
documentation for further details. 
Global Access Portfolios share certain characteristics with hedge funds. In 
particular, an investor who withdraws from a Global Access Portfolio will 
not receive the withdrawal proceeds in their entirety 
until 30-60 days after completion of the Portfolio's audit, which may be 18 
months or longer after the redemption date. Interest may not be paid on any 
proceeds pending distribution. These restrictions 
apply even if the investor's account at JPMorgan is closed. The Confidential 
Private Placement Memorandum and applicable Supplements contain other 
important information about the Global Access 
Portfolios and are available upon request. 
For hedge funds, one of two methods will be used on this statement to report 
how incentive fees that may be owed to the General Partner or Manager are 
paid. The first method is called "Series of 
Shares and Consolidation Method" and will allocate a new series of the hedge 
fund at a par value (e.g. 1, 100 or 1000) for every subscription period 
during the year and a different NAV will be tracked 
for each series. At the end of the applicable incentive fee period 
(generally the end of the year), any series for which an incentive fee is 
payable (i.e., the fund has a net profit or is over the applicable 
"high water mark" and known as the "Consolidating Series") will be 
incorporated with and consolidated as part of the earliest series issued by 
the fund in which an investor has subscribed for which an 
incentive fee is payable (the "Lead Series"). Investors holding shares in a 
Consolidating Series will have their shares redeemed from each of the 
Consolidating Series and simultaneously be issued 
additional shares of the Lead Series (based on the NAV of the Lead Series on 
the conversion date). Any series for which an incentive fee is not payable 
(i.e. the fund has a net loss or is not over the 
applicable "high water mark") will remain as a separate series until the 
following incentive fee period ends (generally at year-end), when it will 
again be evaluated and consolidated as part of the Lead 
Series if the previously described criteria is met. 
The second method is called the "Equalization Method". "Equalization" is an 
accounting methodology used to ensure that each investor in a hedge fund is 
paying his/her equitable allocation of incentive 
fees. Unlike the Series of Shares method, shares held by all investors are 
valued at the same NAV. The "Equalization Amount" reflects an amount 
deducted from the subscription amount in order to 
"equalize" the incentive fees among investors investing to the Fund in the 
current year. The "Equalization Factor" used to determine the Equalization
