networks of communication both in the brain and between =uman beings that we don't understand yet. Shughuang has 
part of =he key, which is a way to identify these non-water soluble proteins =sing what is called a QTY conversion. Not 
sure if you're =nterested, but when we meet next, I should sit down and explain it to =ou if you don't already know. It's 
pretty fascinating. =n addition to figuring out how cells signal and how the networks of =roteins in our body work / 
environment work, this also unlocks many of =he secrets to smells.

make the non-water-soluable =embrane proteins, water-soluable by converting the certain amino acids =hich retains the 
structure but changes the solubility so O2H is sort of =E2 water reversed". O2H has all of the commercialization =ights
