identify the agency, at its request." As of Wednesday, the federation's "internal investigation 
had found that other agency funds and donor information remained unscathed."

FBI Experts Testify At Homicide Trial Of Pennsylvania Man Whose Wife Vanished In 
2012. 
The Harrisburg (PA) Patriot-News (9/2, Miller, 427K) reports, "The DNA of a Cumberland County 
woman who disappeared in March 2012 was detected in blood stains on a carpet, a rug and a 
knife police found in the home she shared with her husband, who is accused of killing her, an 
FBI specialist testified Wednesday." According to the Patriot-News, "Examiner Charity Davis said 
male DNA also was found on the knife along with the DNA of Rabihan Seiders. However, she 
said there was too little male DNA present to identify the donor. Davis was among several FBI 
forensics specialists who testified during the sixth day of the homicide trial of Hap Seiders, 66." 
Chief Deputy District Attorney Courtney Hair LaRue "claims Hap Seiders killed his 53-year-old 
wife and burned her body in the fireplace of their Silver Spring Township home. He was charged 
with homicide last year." 
LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES 
Law Enforcement In Ohio Aims To Curb Gun Violence With Operation Red-Zone. 
The Toledo (OH) Blade (9/2, Mester, Snyder, 88K) reports, "Federal, state, and local law 
enforcement agencies are banding together in a concerted effort to reduce gun violence 
through the Labor Day holiday weekend, but some residents are wary that the move could do 
more harm than good." The Blade adds, "The campaign announced by Justin Herdman, U.S. 
attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, and Toledo police Chief George Kral on Wednesday 
afternoon is a move designed to bring federal charges against individuals illegally carrying 
guns. Anyone prohibited under federal law from possessing a firearm who is found with one will 
be prosecuted in federal court pursuant to that effort, Mr. Herdman said, and anyone who 
commits a violent crime or drug-trafficking offense while possessing a firearm will also be 
charged federally." 
WTOL-TV Toledo, OH (9/2, Strock, 76K) reports, "Toledoans can expect to see a large 
police presence over the holiday weekend, as the city has seen a recent uptick in gun violence. 
Toledo Police Chief George Kral joined U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman at a press conference 
Tuesday afternoon, with a stern warning for perpetrators of violent crime. 'To the criminals and 
those who seek to commit acts of violence in the city, if you continue to break the laws and 
abuse your fellow men and women for your own selfish purposes you will soon find yourself 
behind bars in federal prison for a very long time,' Herdman said." The city "will begin 'Project 
Red Zone' this weekend. The aim is to crack down on gun violence by first tackling the issue of 
illegal gun possession. Herdman explained that if you are prohibited from having a gun and you 
possess one anyway, you'll be in the 'red zone' and could face federal charges." 
WEWS-TV Cleveland (9/2) reports that the operation "will take place in Toledo, 
Youngstown and Canton over the Labor Day holiday weekend. 'It's no secret that violent crime 
is up,' Herdman said. ATF, U.S. Marshals, FBI, DEA agents will be out in force this weekend. 'Be 
aware, if you choose to use firearms to commit crimes, ATF and our law enforcement partners 
will be there, working to hold you accountable for those acts,' said Roland Herndon, ATF Special 
Agent in Charge." WTOL-TV Toledo, OH (9/2, 76K) posts a video report on its website.
