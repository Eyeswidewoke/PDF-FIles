it is my failing not yours. the old math requires numbers . too limiting. ( we can put a metric overlay on later in the 
chain) imagine a shape in real space. it is readily apparent if a line either fits on the shape or not . how do you know. 
? you compare the line with the shape. your visual system allows the mental shape to either map onto or not onto the 
shape in a coherent manner. the shape is not an input device ,it is an object . the organizing principle of the shape is 
language, the shape is a collection of grammars. lines on the shape are either coherent or not. coherent ones are 
legitimate sentences . 
yang is flexible in his use of the term probability.. for example he in a number of papers refers to zipf as a probabiltiy 
distribution. i have checked a number of his papers after your last remark, I think it is a mistake. he means that after 
empirical measurement . for ex word frequency, . if ten times out of 100 the corpus has the word x. then he 
describes the probablility of finding the word as 10 percent . this is not correct. it is only the probablity of finding the 
word in the frequency list . but he is very accomplished at mathematical models.

Interesting image, but I don't see what it tells us about language. 
The problem looks to me like this, roughly. 
Take, say, the human visual system. There's a genetic component that determines that humans will have a mammalian 
and not an insect visual system, and much else. Same with other subsystems of the organism — "organs," "modules." 
language in particular. The technical name for this component, whatever it turns out to be, is UG. UG therefore 
determines that certain systems are possible I-languages for humans, others are not. I presume that is what the 
"biological organizing principle" for language is. It's plainly not an input system, though it determines possible input 
systems for human languages. I don't see how we improve understanding by looking at it from this perspective. 
A minor technical problem, not serious, has to do with distinguishing digital infinity from continuity, like continuous lines 
on the surface of a hemisphere. 
I think you'll find Yang interesting.

it appear to me that ""language" can be defined as the biological organizing principle that creates a shape space. 
"coherent sentences " are defined as those that fit on the shape. The projections on the sensory motors, allows 
communication. . There are an infinite digital number of sentences.that do fit on the shape , but orders of magnitude 
more, that do not fit.- to attempt a naive representation, imagine a hemisphere, ( symmetric), any continuous line 
drawn on its surface , is a sentence. there are infinite numbers of lines that can be drawn. however, trying to connect 
two points , directly without traversing the hemishpere is also infinitely possible but most solutions need to leave the 
surface. The principle that organizes the shape is NOT an input device. one can map inputs onto the shape but it is not
