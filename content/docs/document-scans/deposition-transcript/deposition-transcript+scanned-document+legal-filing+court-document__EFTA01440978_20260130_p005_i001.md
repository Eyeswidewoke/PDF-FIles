Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a 
nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce 
or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax 
treaties contain a provision known as a "saving clause." Exceptions 
specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to 
continue for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise 
become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes. 
If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception 
contained in the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption 
from U.S. tax on certain types of income, you must attach a statement 
to Form W-9 that specifies the following five items. 
1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under 
which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien. 
2. The treaty article addressing the income. 
3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the 
saving clause and its exceptions. 
4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption 
from tax. 
5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of 
the treaty article. 
Example. Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an 
exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese 
student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this 
student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in 
the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of 
the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows 
the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese 
student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese 
student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first 
protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax 
on his or her scholarship or fellowship income would attach to Form 
W-9 a statement that includes the information described above to 
support that exemption. 
If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the 
appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233. 
Backup Withholding 
What is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you 
must under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 28% of such 
payments. This is called "backup withholding." Payments that may be 
subject to backup withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, 
dividends, broker and barter exchange transactions, rents, royalties, 
nonemployee pay, payments made in settlement of payment card and 
third party network transactions, and certain payments from fishing boat 
operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup 
withholding. 
You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you 
receive if you give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper 
certifications, and report all your taxable interest and dividends on your 
tax return. 
Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if: 
1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,
