Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments 
(thus receiving these cash flows). increases in interest rates naturally lilt the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the 
higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises In inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to 
receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in asses holding limits for different types of investors), changes in fax policies, currency 
convertibility (Which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses aro also important risk factors to be 
considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depeeciation, or to specified interest rates - these 
are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index fixings may -- by construction - lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of 
the proper fixing (or mimic' is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed 
coupons. It is also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptionsl also bear the 
risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements. 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including. among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent 
on the investors' own circumstances including their tax position. their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities. and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial 
advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options. loreign or domestic. can be substantial. As a result el the high 
degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all 
investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at http://www.optionsclearing.com/abouVpublications/charactot -riskstsp. If you
