Regional Implications and Challenges. The performance of the 
Iraqi military and the Iraqi PM at the Battle of Basra and in subsequent 
successful operations throughout Iraq should have been a big deal regionally, 
yet it is not being applauded by a lot of our friends in the region. For Saudi 
Arabia, the notion of a successful Shia democracy next door is not good news. 
They are Sunni and have a Shia minority (the inverse of Iraq's demographics). 
The Shia in Saudi are saying two things. First, Sistani (the Iraqi Shia religious 
leader who endorsed democratic elections) did more for the Shia than all of 
Iran's guns, missiles and talk. Second, if Iraq can give a voice to their Sunni 
minority, why can't Saudi do the same for their Shia minority? None of this is 
good for the Saudi royals. They have displayed their unhappiness by not 
sending an Ambassador to Iraq. Add Syria and several of the other regional 
players to the list of unhappy campers if the Iraq initiative is successful. Add to 
this the possibility that Iraq pumps an incremental 4mm barrels per day of oil and 
you can see why the Saudi's are not necessarily big fans of a successful Iraq. 
Then there is Iran. An existential threat to Israel and profoundly challenging to 
the region. A successful Iraq could foment regime change in Iran as it would put 
a Shia led democracy in their back yard. A successful Iraq would create a major 
competitor at the OPEC table. . A successful Iraq would give an American ally a 
1400 mile border with Iran. Our dependence on Saudi Arabia and the threat of 
an unstable Iran are both core challenges to global stability. This is what Iraq is 
about. As shorthand, if you think of Iraq as being about Saudi Arabia and Iran, 
that is a useful window into the broader strategic implications of Iraq.

Iraq Post Invasion. . We made historic mistakes that probably set 
us back 3 years. Mistake #1 demobilizing the army with no substitute livelihood 
for those hundreds of thousand of men. So now you have the most trained, 
armed and able Iraqi men fully emasculated. Mistake #2 de-baathification. The 
Beath Party was the ruling party of Saddam. Anyone who was a party member 
was prevented from getting a meaningful job in the government. The problem is 
that Iraqi society was split into three parts: army, Baath Party members and 
those with nothing. In order to have anything (e.g. a car or property or a middle 
class job) you had to join the Beath Party. Our de-baathification program went 
far too deep. It included normal working men. So now we emasculate those 
men as well. Mistake #3 our military tactics were too limited. They focused on 
hunting down the bad guys and did not do enough to engage the local 
population and enlist them in the effort. We would clear a neighborhood and 
then hold it for a limited time. But ultimately, we would leave, return to base and 
the bad guys would return to the neighborhood and terrorize any locals who 
helped us. Petraeus came in and implemented the tactic of "clear, hold and 
build" which had been developed by a colleague in 2006. Petraeus is serious 
about doing 3/3rds of the ":clear, hold and build" strategy and it has now become 
official doctrine for our counter-insurgency tactics. 
We now go into a 
neighborhood, clear it, move our troops into the neighborhood (no going back to 
the base at the airport) and then invest reconstruction money into the 
neighborhood to build infrastructure and jobs. The result is that we now have
