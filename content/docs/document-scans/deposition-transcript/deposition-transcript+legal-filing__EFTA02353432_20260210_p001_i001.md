I certainly do hope that this time, yo= understand the finality of your "relationship" with my husband. I hope now=you 
can find true happiness without having a relationship with someone else=s husband. I really hope you do. I'm not a 
person who likes to see other pe=ple suffer, no matter what hurts they may have caused. I am not gleeful abo=t your 
loss. Reid says he always wanted to just be friends with you, but I t=ink he understands because of your (plural) behavior 
and the damage you hav= both caused to our marriage and family, that can probably never be. = hear from many 
people (who don't know what's gone on) that you and I would=be great friends. I wish I could say I hope that happens 
someday, but I'm t=e kind of woman who loves the sisterhood, not women who sleep with and fall=in love with 
someone else's husband or significant other, no matter how wil=ing the man is to have his ego stroked and no matter 
how swept away you are=by feelings of some kind of deformed mutation of love. I just don't see tha= kind of friendship 
between us in the cards. However as I told Reid b=fore he picked up the phone to call you, if he could urge you to suck 
up yo=r hurt feelings and send me a sincere apology for participating in an arran=ement that caused damage to Reid, to 
yourself, to me, and to our son. (=ho has been fighting tears all weekend because of his mother's pain and bec=use 
he sees the father figure he has admired his whole life as a weak man w=o has lied and cheated to his mother)....if you 
can find it in your heart t= ask for my forgiveness, I would want very much to forgive you and see you i= a light different 
from the one I have seen you in for years. Perhaps you a=en't aware....Reid has told me about his addiction to you 
before and has as=ed for my help to break it. He finally found the power to do it because of t=e depths of his misery and 
unwillingness to proceed through life as a disho=orable man. I hope you can find a similarly true friend who can do th= 
same for you. I wish you well, believe it or not. Had you not jumped off t=e phone as quickly as you did (which I perfectly 
well understand) he would h=ve told you this. 
Reid and I have a lot of=work to do together to fix the mess you two have caused, but our love is ve=y strong and we will 
get there. I honestly don't want to add to your hurts b= making you think you have destroyed our marriage on top of
