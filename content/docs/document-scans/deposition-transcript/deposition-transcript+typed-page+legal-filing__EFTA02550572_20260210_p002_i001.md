Daldry's film came out too late to set up his drama properly. A few found 9=1 too painful to watch and the kid's affliction 
disturbing. I personally a=ore Daldry and think he is extraordinarily talented. He has been nominated=four out of four, a 
monumental feat few have accomplished. 
"The Descendants" was actually number one or two to win for weeks. Their ca=paign fell apart after Xmas by over 
exposing George and sending a confusin= message on tv spots...first showing Clooney crying over the dying wife th=t 
was not convincing and then showing him running around in flip flops ind=cating a comedy. They never recognized that 
the key was selling Clooney as=a father....a roll on and off the screen he never played before. As smart =s George is 
about his own career he let bad advice get in the way...and he=also split votes with Brad. George has never won SAG in 
the 13 years he h=s been nominated starting with ER due to the fact starving actors think he=has it all. George was 
visibly shocked and hurt when he lost SAG to an unk=own French man. Clooney's campaign then became a vote to make 
it up to him= He is now moving into directing, where he is very talented and will be take= seriously. Next film is a thriller 
about Nazis stealing/hiding art. 
George's posing with yet another gorgeous, very nice, bombshell ex-wrestler= Stacy for months did not help his quest 
for gold either because every two=years there is a new girl. 
My heart told me George had a chance to win Best Actor on his popularity. M= mind told me voter's take evaluating 
performances seriously and they hone=tly didn't think he deserved this particular acting award. Although Cloone= knew 
going into the Kodak Theater that it was a tight race, it was hard f=r him to lose to Jean Dujardin, who barely speaks 
English. 
Also annoying to Clooney is that Jean is a one film American sensation of t=e moment. Jean has no immediate intention 
to work in the states, is not de=ermined to learn our language and is already filming in Europe. 
Dujarin, is wildly popular in his country but not well liked by some who kn=w him. Apparently he is a womanizer. (Odd 
for a French matinee idol) I f=und him charming...but of course my working contact was brief encounters s=nce 
September 
I think the fact the Jean is the George Clooney of Franc= did not help the real George deal with the race. 
Fincher's remake had a moment of Oscar buzz just as nominating ballots went=out and Rooney Mara was sprinkled with 
star dust...knocking beloved Tilda =winton out. Rooney, the elegant chic ingenue did not have the charm of Au=rey 
Hepburn on the red carpet and her sullen appearances turned the press =ff. 
Harvey worried for months about how to get Meryl the Oscar when he had prom=sed it to Michelle Williams for her 
sensational Marilyn. As much as Meryl=wanted it, she could only bring herself to do limited publicity for a bad =ilm. 
On "The Help" Disney overplayed the race card with Viola, over exposing her= She gave the same heart wrenching 
speech about her family of sharecropper= and maids, crying on cue since September. The voters finally tired of thi= 
especially when Viola went on Letterman 24 hours after losing the Bafta t= Meryl and asking Dave if he is a member of 
the academy and can he please =ote for her. I immediately emailed Harvey that she finally blew it. 
Harvey needed one more hat trick to push Meryl in and at the last minute se=t out the message that she shockingly 
hasn't won in 29 years. Literally th= ballots we still on the voter's desks on Monday, President's Day. TV spot= and 
columnists got the word out. In a day, voters instantly switched thei= love to Streep who brilliantly carried every scene. 
Every studio made a hugh effort to win this year by taking a page from Harv=y's play book and working their talent to 
the bone. They all ultimately fa=led to really ignite the emotions of the voters. That is the key, Harvey'= take on feelings, 
which is so ironic coming from a man who is so hard on =is own help. 
And in the end, it's Woody who resigned from the Academy years ago saying i='s crazy to pit talent against each other to 
evaluate each others work....=hat really says it all.
