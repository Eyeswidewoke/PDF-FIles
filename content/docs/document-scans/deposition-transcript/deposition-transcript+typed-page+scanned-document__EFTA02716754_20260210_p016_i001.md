The capital region still serves as a reservoir from w=ich patients travel to rural areas and spark fresh outbreaks, De Cock 
says4e=804eand now that the rainy season has ended, travel may pick up. In Bong County, =or instance, a few hours 
northwest of Monrovia, two big outbreaks are spreading, at least one seeded from the capital. The treatment unit in 
the district of Suakoko, run by the International Medical Corps, is full, a=d new patients are brought in daily. Sambhavi 
Cheemalapati, the unit Hs PROGRAM coordinator, says she is seeing far more patients than are accounted for in=the 
official numbers. Aid should focus on spreading prevention messages in thes= remote locales, Goffeau says. "If the 
people really unders=and what Ebola is and how to avoid infection, we might stop this epidemic," he=says. Such 
REGIONAL flare-ups make it unlikely that the Liberian epidemic will be over anytime soon, Rosling says. Still, he be=ieves 
it's possible that the country may see its first day without a single c=se as early as December. Given the cataclysmic 
projections of just 3 months ago, that would be a remarkable turnaround.

=p class="MsoNormal">GENEVA (AP) — Police brutality, military inte=rogations and prisons were among the top 
concerns of a U.N. panel's report Friday tha= found the United States to be falling short of full compliance with an 
internatio=al anti-torture treaty. The report by the U.N. Committee Against Torture, its first such review of the U.S. 
record si=ce 2006, expressed concerns about allegations of police brutality and excessiv= use of force by law 
enforcement officials, particularly the Chicago Police =epartment's treatment of blacks and Latinos. It also called for 
restricting the use of taser weapons by police to life-threateni=g situations. But it had no specific recommendation or 
reaction to a grand ju=y's decision not to indict the white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri who fatally shot a black 
and unarmed teenager. 
=br> 
The report also criticizes the U.S. re=ord on military interrogations, maximum security prisons, illegal migrants and 
solitary confinement while calling for tougher federal laws to define and outlaw torture, including with detainees at 
Guantanamo Bay and in Yemen. It also called for abolishing interrogation techniques that rely on sleep or sensor= 
deprivation "aimed at prolonging the sense of capture." "There are numerous areas in which certain things should be 
changed for the United Sta=es to comply fully with the convention," Alessio Bruni of Italy, one =f the panel's chief 
investigators, said at a news conference Friday in Ge=eva. He was referring to the U.N. Convention Against Torture, 
which took effect in =987 and the United States ratified in 1994. The U.N. committee's 10 independent experts are 
responsible for reviewing t=e records of all 156 U.N. member countries that have ratified the treaty agai=st torture and 
all "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
