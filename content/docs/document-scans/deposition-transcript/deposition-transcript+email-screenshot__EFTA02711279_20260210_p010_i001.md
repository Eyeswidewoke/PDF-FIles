Physical knowledge: observational: each item an assertion of the results of an observation. The coupling of observer-
observed: undifferentiated activity. No difference: acethe duality of choice becomes the singularity of existence; /The effort of 
virtue the unconsciousness of foreknowledge.fili° No distinctions: life-death; real-apparent; actual-hypothetical; no 
distinctions: true-false-maybe. No distinctions: past-present-future; end-beginning. Life is just a question of whatever you get 
away with. 
The only place left is nowhere. aceSo which wayams which is now no more a query / And up or downaTMs as free as heads or 
tails. / Without a center or a pull to check it / The very sense of that dimension fails: / Rise! Fall! Sinkswim? All idle 
theory
Waiting for the present. 
ficeThings fall apartitI" No other to fight. No cause for which to struggle. No ideal for which to offer sacrifice, ticeYou are a 
metaphor and they are lies.am And I. . aceNot mine this life that must he lived in me.ftm No other. No self, No manaTMs 
land. ficeDo you look into yourself in order to recognize the fury in his face? It is there as clearly as in your own breastlim No 
one: the unity is unitless. aceOne beats and bears for that which one believes, / Thatams what one wants to get near. Could it 
after all / Be merely oneself?fill6 The unity is unitless. 
DonATMt try to repeal circumstances. Try something new. iiceA people without history / Is not redeemed from time, for 
history is a pattern / Of timeless moments"' t7 accAhistory: Amen.ttm 
ficeAll time is eternally present.a"9 Not in the past, future, or present. Not before or after. Not now, then or when. Not 
anywhere. ficeHere and there does not matter / We must be still and still moving / Into another intensity / For a further union, 
a deeper communion.ttu° 
ficeThe composition we live in changes but essentially what happens does not change. We inside us do not change but our 
emphasis and the moment in which we live changes. That it is never the same moment it is never the same emphasis at any 
successive moment of existing. Then really what is repetition? It is very interesting to ask and it is a very interesting thing to 
Icnowilui What is repetition? What is insistence? What is repetition? What is insistence? What is repetition? What is 
insistence? 
ficeThe theory of description matters most. / It is the theory of the word for those / For whom the word is the making of the 
worlditm Description is the thing: nothing. 
Confusion: no-thing=thing. The incredible something of nothing. 
Things operate the waste system. Idealization or performance: AccRidiculous the waste sad time / Stretching before and 
after.am Activity is undifferentiable: no difference: no between. The performance decreates the idealization, the thing. And 
yet . . . the description of performance is itself an idealization, a thing. Confusion: Eicewe had the experience but missed the 
meaning, / And approach to the meaning restores the experience / in a different form, beyond any meaning:11"
