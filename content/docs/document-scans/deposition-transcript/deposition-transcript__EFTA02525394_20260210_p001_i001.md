Re: 
as i am walking in to my negotation that i have been preparing for , wit= little focus on anything but your self in your 
email„ i will try to make=it short.. you say i don't say thank you, but i know its not true, you =atch sue do nothing but try 
to be as helpful as she can, she is not trying=to replace you, she does what she can, as little as that might be, to be 
h=lpful.. I was not kissing sue, / i took a nap you got out of bed, if=you are concerned that others are getting more than 
you. I'm sorry, i=think you have got it backwards.. i have asked you what you would like to =o , you said you didnt know. 
you wanted to be in charge of the staff.. =ou chose not to train your dog. its been a year. your reaction is surprisi=g, 
according to you, you cater to my every whim„ but when i ask just w=at does that mean , you tell me i ask you to do 
labels and buy shampoo,=( the labels i asked two weeks ago-- you didnt do it). you criticize me=for saying thank you for 
sues stupid things. Would you prefer i not =ay thank you to her. i was originally going to ask sarh to buy her the =lothes 
( this is the correct spelling), but i thought you would get upset =f i did, I realize this time has been difficult for you as 
well as me..=A0 I warned you about turning sex into a designated task on certain days a= certain ties„ I remeber telling 
you it was dangerous„ you chose to igno=e that advice. , i lived up to our agreement.. AT some point you =ave to come 
to grips with actual reality. i ask what you have done to c=ter to my every wish no answer. i tell you that if you won"t 
d= nice things others will, It makes no sense to me. you are now jealous of =he reatment that sue receives„ jenn gets the 
credit „ nanny gets to watc= tv, and in your mind you only get jokes.. lam glad you can't live thi= way. When i get back, 
not until around 8 ,we should come to some sort of=agreemnent.. I'm not sure about the mansion comment. what is the 
point=

with me during the day, you constantly make snooty comm=nts, All your jokes are about killing me or my leaving and 
you bringing ot=er girls over. Sue walks in and you don't stop touching, hugging, kiss=ng, tickling her back and lovingly 
calling her name. You make a point to s=y thank you for the stupidest things she does and then you ask me to go bu= her 
close because she is supposedly helpful. You let your assistant buy a=mansion and put her in charge of your staff while 
you ask me to label ligh= switches and buy shampoo. 
No kiss goodbye, no thank you when I shave your neck, no I missed you, no l=am happy to see you, no movie, no 
ride to the office, no sex, no affect=on...yet you do all that with others like sue. 
I can't live this way. I need a break. I can't stand you treating m= with that cold attitude any longer while you are 
perfectly capable of bei=g nice thoughtful and a pleasure to be around
