Re: URGENT: BuzzFeed News inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment 
if he doesnt publish today. 
I wond=r whether you should nt get out in front and post your repsonses on your f=cebook 
and twitter. if you stress that false accusations=are made against you for.  
 
then when t=e next group of gilrs that 
read the news come forward you will have alread= given your view :?? not without risk , 4)=A0 the only risk that i see 
having it appear if there is a cha=ce that buzzfeed wont publish

p=ople, ranging from the false third party claims about actions involving un=nown individuals, to what at best seems to

over any extended peri=d, either professionally, or privately. 
<=iv>As to why some people might make false accusations against me, I suspec= it may be obvious: I am a high 
profile male atheist scientist who h=s made statements that are deemed provocative or controversial, and has 
de=ended sometimes unpopular causes and/or individuals. Moreover there =re a number of groups within the atheist 
community who openly seek to impu=n the integrity of well known male atheists, and others who, when they hea= 
these claims, naturally, and perhaps even innocently, tend to interpret w=atever they may witness in that light. I think 
there is reasonable =vidence, which you may already be aware of, that the false items you liste= are likely to have that 
origin. I began to see false claims about m= online in a wide variety of contexts a as my public profile raised, begin=ing 
perhaps a decade ago with the online claim that Stephen Hawking and I =ad an orgy on a Caribbean island. It is common 
knowledge that celebr=ty attracts all forms of negative attention from many different angles...A0 There is no pattern

=ome to decide in advance that there must be a conspiracy by professional o=ganizations to protect these people and 
then to seek out, cherry pick, and=if necessary distort, any claims that might then support that prejud=ce. That is not 
the way to assess evidence and test hypotheses. 
A better question is why Buzzfeed continues to try imp=y that complaints that have been found baseless by 
professional institutio=s are of sufficient seriousness to consider publishing as news. It i= demeaning for everyone. I just 
returned tonight from a bookstore si=ning in Prescott Arizona, where my spirits were raised when I saw over 
100=people in a small town come to a bookstore on a cold evening, excited to a=k questions and learn about the 
universe. It find nothing more exhil=rating than having the privilege (and it is a privilege I take=quite seriously) to excite 
and inspire people with my words and my writing=to celebrate the universe in which we live, and I relish the opportunity 
t= show respect for them and their interests when I meet with them in signin=s, lectures, or when they ask for photos 
with me. I try to raise peo=le up, and not demean them, which is why I find the false allegations you =ave suggested to 
be so repugnant. You don't know me at all, =rid yet you seem to have systematically gone about trying to find reasons
