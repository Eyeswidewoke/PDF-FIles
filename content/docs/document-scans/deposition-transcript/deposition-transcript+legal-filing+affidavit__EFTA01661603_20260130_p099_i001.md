Prince Andrew's friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, some underage girls and a very disturbing sto... Page 5 of 8 
ever closer scrutiny. 
And now one of those who witnessed Epstein's louche existence at first hand has revealed what life was 
like inside his sordid world — and her story provides a disturbing portrait of sickening seduction and the 
power of money. 
a church-going, all-American brunette, was recruited six years ago into Epstein's 
househo as an occasional home help, and was induced to perform demeaning sexual services. 
She has never before spoken about the bizarre five-year friendship with the financier — or an episode in 
which she claims she was groped by Prince Andrew, fourth in line to the throne. 
But with Epstein finally admitting that the sensational accusations against him are true after all, 
life within the Epstein camp is returning to haunt her. 
Although 21 at the time and a consenting adult, she feels she was preyed upon all the same. 
"I was groomed for it," she says. "I made a pact with the devil in exchange for excitement and glamour. 
I was only a college student. I was hard-up and foolish." 
as from a loving, church-going family in Maine, and was studying psychology at Atlantic 
o ege in Palm Beach. She hoped to become a family therapist. 
She had no reason to be suspicious when a handsome brunette in sports gear approached her as she sat 
on a bench on campus one day. That was in February 2001 and the stranger, whom she later discovered 
was Ghislaine Maxwell — daughter of the late, disgraced Robert Maxwell — had an unusual proposition: 
in return for $20 an hour, she was to answer the phones and serve occasional drinks at Epstein's home. 
She recalls: "I thought, what a great opportunity! It seemed pretty easy. I felt as if I had fallen into a pot 
of gold. All my friends were jealous of me for getting such a great job." 
Johanna's first visit to Epstein's pink mansion involved nothing more than running errands for printer 
cartridges and science magazines, but her second trip brought a surprising question. 
"Ghislaine asked me, 'Do you want to make $100 rubbing feet?' I said I would love to do that." 
Impressed with Jeffrey's knowledge of psychology — one of her college subjects — 
had already 
warmed to her new employer, and was further impressed when he and a female frien s lowed her the 
basics of massage. 
"It was fun," she says. "Really, though, I was being groomed. I really liked him, and I didn't get any 
sexual vibes from him. I viewed him as a great uncle who wanted me to be happy." 
must have learned well, because the friendship and the opportunities grew rapidly. First, at 
Easter 2001, there was a trip to his seven-storey townhouse in New York, and her first brush with 
royalty. 
She recalls: "Prince Andrew was there and Ghislaine and a couple of other girls my age. Andrew was 
very charming. I didn't know exactly who he was but felt that I knew him. She (Ghislaine) came down 
with a present for him — a latex puppet of him from Spitting Image.
