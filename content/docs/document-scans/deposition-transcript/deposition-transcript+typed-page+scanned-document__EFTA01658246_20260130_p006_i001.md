launched earlier this month in the city." 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (7/29, story 6, 2:00, O'Donnell, 4.28M) reported the 
Administration announced Wednesday that it is expanding "Operation Legend" sending 
"additional federal agents outside of Oregon, it says, to combat upticks in violence in Cleveland, 
Milwaukee, and Detroit. Detroit's chief of police welcomes the federal support to combat violent 
crime, but says he doesn't need their help with protesters." Detroit Police Chief James Craig: 
"We never requested support for any protest-related activity. We do support...anything to 
reduce violence in our city." 
The Washington Times (7/29, Chasmar, 492K) reports Chief Craig "said Tuesday his city 
isn't seeing the riots that are occurring in other major cities across the country because his 
police department is supported by the mayor and fellow Detroiters who are `fed up' with the 
`misguided radicals' fomenting chaos." 
The Washington Times (7/29, Mordock, 492K) reports Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan on 
Twitter Wednesday "assured residents his city didn't initiate the surge in federal officers." 
Duggan tweeted, "Today's announcement of additional federal agency staff was not initiated by 
the City of Detroit. So long as they are used in the continuing effort to enforce federal laws on 
illegal gun trafficking and gang violence, DPD will continue its strong partnership with those 
agencies." Meanwhile, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett last week said he was "extremely 
concerned" about the deployment. 
US Attorney Distinguishes Federal Role In Portland From Crime-Fighting 
Assistance In Other Cities. The AP (7/29, Richmond) reports that on Wednesday, federal 
prosecutors "worked...to dispel concerns that federal agents headed to a number of U.S. cities 
will be used to break up protests, insisting that the agents will work side-by-side with local and 
state investigators to solve violent crimes." President Trump "announced last week that he was 
sending agents to more U.S. cities...to combat a rise in violent crime." Matthew Krueger, the US 
Attorney in Milwaukee, "told reporters during a news conference...that the media was confusing 
agents' missions," and that "agents being sent to cities other than Portland were part of a U.S. 
Department of Justice effort to bolster manpower in high-crime cities." Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-
WI) "said that after speaking with Krueger, she is supportive of the operation in Milwaukee," but 
"faulted Trump's administration for not being clear from the outset." 
Federal Agents Headed For Detroit. 
The AP (7/29) reports from Detroit, "Federal agents being sent to Detroit by the Trump 
administration will help local authorities fight violent crime and won't interfere with protests 
against racism or excessive force by police, the region's top federal prosecutor said 
Wednesday." US Attorney Matthew Schneider "dismissed as `irresponsible rhetoric' any 
suggestion that the government wants to quash dissent in Michigan, seeking to allay fears that 
they would have a role similar to the one agents have had at protests in Portland, Oregon, in 
recent weeks. Instead, he stressed that they would be helping local law enforcement combat a 
rise in violent crime in Detroit. `The United States Department of Justice will not sit on the 
sidelines while murderers spread violence in our neighborhoods,' Schneider told reporters as he 
described a `surge' of agents and deputy marshals in Detroit." 
The Detroit News (7/29, Ferretti, 825K) reports, "Schneider told The News last week that 
he was actively working with Washington, D.C., to `bring more federal resources and more 
federal law enforcement agents to Michigan.' The effort, he noted, is an extension of Operation 
Relentless Pursuit, a program rolled out in Detroit last winter by U.S. Attorney General William 
Barr." The News adds, "The program to assist local law enforcement establish new task forces to 
track down the most violent offenders also is targeted at Memphis, Baltimore, Kansas City, 
Cleveland, Milwaukee and Albuquerque, Barr said in December when he announced the 
program alongside Craig and leaders of the FBI, ATF, DEA and U.S. Marshals Service." 
The Detroit Free Press (7/29, Baldas, 1.52M) reports, "Federal law enforcement agencies 
have a message for Detroit: We are coming to help your city fight violence, not harass or
