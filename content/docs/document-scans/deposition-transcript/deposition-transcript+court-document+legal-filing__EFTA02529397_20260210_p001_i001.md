A couple of my favourites are as follows;

Isabel calls me to say she is having trouble with her Portuguese domes=ics and as I "have a way with staff" 
would I mind dropping in to see =hem, which I do a couple of days later. 
I forget their names, but lets call them Jose and Paulina. I ask Jose =hat the matter is. He replies and I quote as 
near verbatim as i can recall; 
"Sir, its not that I mind Miss Isabel screaming at me, its not th=t I mind Miss Isabel screaming at me in front of 
my wife, its not that I mind Mrs Is=bel slapping me, its not that I mind her slapping me in from of my wife, its ju=t that I 
cannot accept being slapped in the street" !!! 
Another good one was when I took Isabel to Bali, Indonesia 15 yrs ago.=20 Whilst there she did a lot of shopping 
of local artifacts and hand crafts,=20 including ordering a large bolt of fabric specially woven to her instructions. She 
asked Ugo Gerasati, the Brazilian socialite who had a fabricshop out there at the time specialising in Balinese 
batiquesetc, how =e proposed sending this to her once completed, as she had no intention whatso=ver of being paying 
outrageous postage and packing charges. He told her that he=had an excellent solution, which would involve no costs at 
all. He would ask th= next English customer who happened to be in the shop when the fabric was re=dy, if they would 
mind taking it with them back to London. Quite a favour to as= of anyone especially when this bolt was the size of a 
large packing case. 
In any event the late Mary Howard (Lord Patrick Howard's charming =ife) dropped by a few weeks later to visit 
Ugo and was tasked with taking this h=ge package to London which she readily agreed to do. 
On arrival in London, the first thing she did was to call Isabel whom =he had never met. She did this promptly at 
9:00Am in the morning, not a good t=me for Isabel who is a night owl and generally only goes to sleep around 6 
and=then wakes around lunchtime. The result of this call, which of course woke Isabe=, was for her to scream at Mary 
"Do you know what time this is? Do you t=ink this is an office?" To which Mary replied, somewhat startled at the 
hostili=y of this reaction, " I was calling to let you know I have brought your fabric=back from Bali". Isabel, not remotely 
mollified, cursed her for waking her =p and added as an aside "Well drop it off this afternoon at 4:00pm" and=then 
slammed down the phone without so much as good bye. 
Mary, somewhat aghast by this behaviour, generous to the extreme, put =t down to a bad night and that 
afternoon turned up at 11 Tregunter Rd with th= huge parcel. She rang the door and waited and waited and waited and 
finally=20 Isabel opened the door on the chain and asked who she was. "I am Mary =oward with your fabric from Bali".
