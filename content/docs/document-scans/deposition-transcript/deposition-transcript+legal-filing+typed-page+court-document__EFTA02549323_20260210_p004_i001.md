The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic=National Committee's servers. 
But nothing in the public record sug=ests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative therefore hinges 
on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed=to help Mr. Trump's election, and that the Trump campaign 
reciproc=ted by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance an= investigation, there's still no public 
evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to sow po=itical discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to 
a lesser extent Mr. Trum=. 
Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advo=ated dovish policies. But 
so did numerous American political and academic =lites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential campaigns 
routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign pow=rs. The Clinton campaign funded the Steele dossier, 
whose British author p=id Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta Group, led by the brother=of Mrs. Clinton's 
campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for Russia's largest bank and the Europ=an Center for a Modern Ukraine, 
both with deep Kremlin ties. The Clinton F=undation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected 
businesses.=u> 
No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Muell=r has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence sugg=sts one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured to London, plied 
with the prospect of Russian information damagi=g to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to dinner, where he drunkenly bragged 
that he=E2.4>d heard about such dirt but never seen it. These circumstances not=only fail to suggest Mr. 
Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment. The source of this information, former A=stralian diplomat 
Alexander Downer, admits Mr. Papadopolous never mentione= emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a 
connection between the D=C hack and the Trump campaign. 
Crossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question= If Russia promised unspecified dirt on 
Mrs. Clinton but never delivered i=, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If anything, such 
behavior suggests an attempt to entice and pot=ntially embarrass Mr. Trump by dangling the prospect of compromising 
infor=ation and getting his aides to jump at it. 
Given the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the =BI would initiate a counterintelligence 
investigation, led by politically =iased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and subsequent 
leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI=sincerely believed Trump associates were Russian targets or agents, 
the pr=per response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he could protect =is campaign and the country. 
Mr. Trump's critics argue that the claim of political bi=s is belied by the fact that Crossfire was 
not leaked before the election.=ln fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the Trump-
Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after C=ossfire's launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr. Comey briefed =ongress, 
triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patron= embarked on a media roadshow, making their dossier 
something of an open secret in Washington. 
On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. C=mey from Senate Minority 
Leader Harry Reid, saying he'd learned of="evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government and 
Donald Trump's presidential campaign," whic= had "employed a number of individuals with significant and distur=ing 
ties to Russia and the Kremlin." On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic members of four House committees wrote a public 
letter to Mr. Comey requesting "that the FBI assess whether connections betw=en Trump campaign officials and Russian 
interests" may have contri=uted to the DNC hack so as "to interfere with the U.S. presidentia= election." On Sept. 23, 
Yahoo News's Michael Isikoff repo=ted the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier's allegations regarding =arter Page. On 
Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: 40=9Cln my communications with you and other top officials in the 
national se=urity community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and 
coordination between Donald Tru=p, his top advisors, and the Russian government."
