agreed in November to train 6,000 to 8,000 Libyan soldiers at a military ba=e in Bulgaria. This paltry effort will not be 
nearly enough to aid Libyans who oppose militancy. U.S. and NATO mili=ary forces should not enter Libya—a move we 
know from past experience will strengthen jihadists there. But a far larger training effort should be mounted outside 
Libya. 
The Muslim Brotherhood: In 2013, the biggest gamble in the region was the Egyptian army's decision i= July to violently 
crush the Muslim Brotherhood and remove that nation's first democratically elected president. The military-dominated 
government seems to announce each week a new crackdown o= the Brotherhood and other critics. But it is not clear 
that the use of force is working. The Egyptian military =ampaign against the Brotherhood has now killed more people 
than the Iranian government's 2009 crushing of the "Green Revolution." Yet Cairo has failed to s=op regular 
demonstrations by the Brotherhood. It has also failed to halt a series of car bombings by Islamic extremist group= that 
are urging Brotherhood members to take up arms. The stakes in Egypt=are enormous. The crackdown could succeed—
or drive tens of thousands (possibly hundreds of thousands) of conservative activists into t=e arms of al Qaeda. The 
reaction of Republican and Democrats to these developments? 
Collective silence. The Obama administration should suspend all U.S. military aid to Egypt and stop embracing the Saudi 
fantasy that autocrats are the region's low-risk cure=all. Over the long-term, autocrats foster instability and economic 
stagnation—=ot stability—in the Middle East.

Syria: 2013 will be viewed as the yea= that President Bashar al-Assad turned the tide in the war in Syria. As Adam 
Entous and =iobhan Gorman detailed in a Wall Street Journal story this week, "all-in" military support from Iran and 
Hezbollah allowed Assad to retake crucial territory. The Obama administration, however, blinked. Obama had vowed to 
punish Assad for any chemical weapons attacks. Yet the president held of= on air strikes or fully arming the rebels, citing 
fears of getting embroiled in another Midea=t conflict. The result is a conflict in Syria that could drag on for years. Assad 
can hold much of the country, but=not all of it. 
Jihadists, meanwhile, are taking control of the oppos=tion. Thousands of militants from Iraq, Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia 
have flocked to Syria. An estimated 1,500 to 2,000 Europ=an citizens and dozens of American citizens have joined the 
fight there as wel=. An unknown number are being radicalized. Some of these jihadists will likely return home, as it 
becomes clear that Assad will not be toppled in 2014. The Obama administration is gambling that CIA drone strikes and 
NSA surveillanc= will somehow hold them at bay. More likely, the blowback from Syria will resemble that of the 1980s 
anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan. Jihadists from that conflict sparked a decade-long ci=il war in Algeria that killed 
50,000—and, of course, carried out the 9/11 at=acks. 
The Obama administration's only remaining leverage =n Syria is its economic sanctions on Iran, Assad's primary military 
backer. Any n=clear agreement with Iran that involves a reduction in economic sanctions should include Iranian support 
for a peace settlement in Syria. The chances of =ashington agreeing on such a strategy are low. Our political elite was
