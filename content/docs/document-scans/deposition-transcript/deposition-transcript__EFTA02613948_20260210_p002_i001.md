First of all I would like to sp=cify that I fully assume the paternity of the study. No project came out o= my 
agency without my approval. I assume all the errors, the main one being that I first study the implementation of the 
blocks and=not details and I beg you to accept my apologies. This is not professional=on my part. 
I just would like to give you s=me explanation about my misunderstanding. I am happy to have a call on thurs or 
friday. 
1-The access indicated as Priva= entrance was for me a secondary access. I wanted to make a main access 
to=+15.50. The visit of the house had to understand by this level and the further we go in the house the more we are 
privative (k=owing that we are in a semi-private villa) 
Your note for the view of St Jo=n and the windy space is perfectly justified but because of the double use=of 
access this parameter seemed acceptable to me. I take note of that. Regarding the toilet again we have not done a 
detailed =ob and this is not correct on our part I thought that these minor aspects =ould be studied in the following 
phases. We are in a very preliminary phas=. 
1 the service entrrance is r=ght off the dock the first think anyone sees? if i=want to go to my room , it is silly 
to walk through the entire house= . . it shares a very steep road with servie 4 mete=s away. 
the angles views are 
ALL WRONG exce=t for the pool. not sure how this happened again. especailly =iven the current layout , dictates the 
best views. and they are NE ..C24k North is already bad and yours are worse. 
my bath faces GSJ , and=not the bvi.. 
it is low ugly and is intersected by the corner of th= library. 
2- The cinema we know perfectly=well the noise nuisance of a cinema for that it is enough to make a 
double=sealed box and to create SAS, the technical aspect in projection or retro-projection too. For the number of 
places the plan w=s more indicative. None of this was detailed and I understand your wrath. =n the other hand the 
height was taken into account since we had planned a =ateral ramp which allowed us to gain the height not necessary. \ 
The cinema makes zero =ense there are doors that open to light. doors that open to no=se there is a sitting 
room above. pipes air =on , all silly ,. . toilets opening dir=ctly into the movie area??! with both light and sound. 
=wice as many seats as requested 3 times. 
3-The 2 toilets noted, but for = pool area, hall, sitting, pool area, loggia terrace of 1500m 24)=A6. it does not 
seem extravagant to have 2 restrooms.=/p> 
1 the toilets are next to on= another in my home. no guests . and they op=n on to the sitting area directly , 
awful. =C24> i dont want to see someone come out of the toilet.. 
4-The toilet of the room we spo=e more implantation than operation. The big window totally agrees like we =id 
not study the facades, this point would have been studied with the architectural composition.
