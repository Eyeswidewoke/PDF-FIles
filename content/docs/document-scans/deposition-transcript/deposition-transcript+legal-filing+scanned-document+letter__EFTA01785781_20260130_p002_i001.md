would have been able to pus= it down even further, and off the page. WE did manage to get rid of the d=ily beast article, 
which is now far removed, inspite of their own effor=s to keep it prominent. 
Toxic suggested sea=ch engine terms that popped up automatically when you typed in your name a=e also now 
removed. 
Wikipedia was an important=victory, as it will always be at the top of the search engine results. ow =he head 
lines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile. Instead,=Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundation, Promotion 
of Scientists. We have =topped the hacking on your wiki site, and that was a major effor. Your wik= entry now is pretty 
tame, and bad stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and p=sed to the bottom. Careful editing and wording has muted the 
effect immens=ly. We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption, and now has an=entirely different photo and 
caption. This was a big success. 
=OA 
We pushed the Edge all the way up to =he front page, where it was previously buried on page 5 of google 
searc=. 
We have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, an= other pages are also filled with your material. 
=nd, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still =ew, and subject to volitility, especially if 
new original content is not a=ded on a minimum of a weekly basis. I have been forbideen to add new conte=t to the 
philanthrophic site as well as the science site, and therefore, a= a result our rating slipped down (still on the first page, 
but would have=liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push Huffington off p=ge). We also helped with you 
images, and the first images that come of you=on a google search are not of your mug shot, etc. 
<=iv>Your daily beast foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites ag=inst you in the same way that we try to 
depromote you. 
As far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I =0 not know what you wish to do. Clearly, you 
have no interest in my contin=ing. And, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the=latter, and you 
stop, eventually it will just go into the way of entropy, =nd it will return to the old form. The major work has been done, 
but it ne=ds to be maintained. For it to get better results, it needs to have consta=t input and supervision, and that 
means generating proper content, not jus= editing and grammatical fixes. Writers need to know what to write. THe 
ph=lanthrophy site is at the bottom of the page precisely because you have no= allowed us to add any content to it, and 
as a result it suffers. 
=div> 
You paid Mike $2500, which he applied for the purchasin= of his replacement servers, but his fee of $7500 
balance is now due if yo= want to continue. Please let me know what you want to do. I need to infor= him, and if you are 
not going to use him, he needs to take on his othe= clients and devote his time there. 
This needs to be contrasted with what we started with, which was a search=on your name, which had nine/10 
very toxic prominent stories, and toxic Wi=i article and headline.
