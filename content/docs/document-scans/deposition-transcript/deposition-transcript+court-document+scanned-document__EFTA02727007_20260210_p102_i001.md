Current Problem 
Earlier this morning Mr. Epstein was found by SHU staff in his cell with a string loosely tied around his neck, It is 
unclear at this time if Mr. Epstein had placed the string around his own neck. 
When Mr. Epstein was asked by this writer how he ended up on Suicide Watch, he denied remembering. He stated he 
got a drink of water last night in his cell and went back to bed. He said the next thing he remembered is hearing himself 
snore. He said he wants to know why he is on Suicide Watch. He was informed that staff stated he was found in his 
cell with a string on his neck. According to Medical records, he had been seen by Medical for this and had a rule out of 
self inflicted injuries. 
When this writer reviewed the Staff Suicide Watch Log, it noted that Mr. Epstein told the staff watching him that his 
cellmate tried to kill him, which Mr. Epstein did not tell this writer when this writer had interviewed Mr. Epstein. This 
writer was not able to ask Mr. Epstein about this, since Mr. Epstein was now in Legal. The Captain was notified about 
this notation and the Captain stated they were already aware of this statement.
