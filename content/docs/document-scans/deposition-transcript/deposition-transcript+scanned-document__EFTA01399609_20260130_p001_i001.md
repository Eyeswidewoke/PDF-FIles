Marci & Brett met with Craig's widow, Wendy Haesemeyer, to see if we could be of assistance 
and she was not ready to move forward with a trust and she was still pretty shell-shocked about the 
unexpected death of her husband. Mike McCarthy had an appointment to meet with Wendy in March and fl 
ew to Los Angeles before heading to another meeting in San Francisco. Mrs Haesemeyer cancelled their 
appointment when he reached the airport in LA. Craig Haesemeyer has passed away.
