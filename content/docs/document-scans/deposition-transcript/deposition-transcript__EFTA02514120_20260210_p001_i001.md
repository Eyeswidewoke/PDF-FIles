Just =anded in NY. Will call as soon as I can. We are going to hire a PR firm to=help with the latest articles. I also 
need to hire a lawyer to make sure e=erything I say is OK, but I'm sick of not saying anything. I've wr=tten down a few 
thoughts on the plane: I'm sure it's too muc= info, but here is first draft. 
<=iv> 
I vehemently deny any allegations that I so called "=helped procure" prostitutes for JE. I used to be an executive 
assista=t who scheduled appointments for Mr E.; some of these appointments were fo= massages. I was never privy to 
what took place during those massages. I n=ver had anyone complain to me that something untoward was happening, 
nor d=d I ever witnesses anything questionable take place. I had never seen any =f these masseuses before until they 
arrived at the house of their own acco=d; they certainly did not look underage to me. I knew nothing about them. = 
never spoke to them other than to schedule massage appointments. I'm =orry if these women now regret their actions 
and professions, but I had no=hing to do with it. I'm sure the allure of making millions off their r=grettable decisions is 
enticing, especially when their lawyers are willing=to work for free to make a name for themselves. I have been unfairly 
victi=ized by these Jane Does, whom I don't even know who they are, their la=yers, and by the media making up endless 
lies about me and making up outra=eous allegations all because I followed the advice of my lawyers to plead =he Fifth 
for every single question asked of me, even a question as =imple as "what is your name?" I plead the Fifth on, in a civil 
s=it which I was subpoenaed for. I was a young woman whom all of a sudden my=name was caught up in something 
which I had no involvement with. I wanted =othing more than to answer all the questions asked of me by those 
unscrupurous lawyers, but felt it was best to follow the advice of my own lawyers t= plead the Fifth; what did I know 
about the legal system? So that's wh=t I did and am still paying the price 9 years later. I'm tired of allo=ing the media to 
abuse me to sell newspapers and not defending myself agai=st it. 
True, I once=worked for JE and lived in an apt on 66th St. I started my 
=business in 2006 while 
also working for JE. Since I couldn't afford a =eparate office at the time, I used my home address for my business 
address= I no longer live at that address, nor have I conducted business from that=address for many years. 
Yes, I changed my l=st name because I wanted to distance myself from my family who disowned me=over not 
being the same religion as them. It was too painful for me to use=the same last name as parents and siblings who didn't 
want me to be a =art of their family anymore. If your family wasn't willing to sp=ak to you over not wanting to be a 
Jehovah's Witness, would you want t= keep the same last name as them?
