Good news and not so good news. 
On Thursday I saw the neurologist, Dr. Smallberg, who saw my neck and shoulder 
xrays. Very good news is that he now says I can skip the second cervical spine 
surgery. (Remember I actually went to the hospital to do it in April but it was 
aborted at the last minute.) He said thatl'm getting stronger and if it stays 
this way, I'm ok. As to my sore right shoulder, he doesn't think it's related to 
the cervical spine, but he didn't look at the MRI saying he doesn't have the 
expertise and that I had to deal with the shoulder doctor. 
Btw, I had dropped off a set of these xrays to the the surgeon - O'Leary but 
received no response. I am told that no news from his office is good news. 
On Friday, I got a call from Karen Schneider, the orthopedist, who I had seen two 
weeks ago about about my painful right shoulder. She had taken the x-rays of my 
neck and both shoulders. During the visit she said she didn't think surgery for 
the shoulder was in the cards, said it looked like arthritis, not a ruptured 
rotator cuff. She sent me for MRI's of both shoulders which I did this past week. 
Btw, she's the younger dr. in Bart Nissenson's office. He's one of the top 
athletic knee doctors. 
On Friday and gave me the following rundown: There is muscle atrophy (this whole 
thing started last November and I haven't been able to work out with weights 
since); there is moderate to severe arthritis, but it's not bone on bone; there 
are moderate tears to the rotator cuff but it's not completely ruptured. 
Then she told me 
(a) I could get a shoulder replacement (which I've never heard of). I told her no 
way and no thanks; 
(b) arthroscopic shoulder surgery, which is a real operation under general 
anesthesia, with same recovery time as regular surgery. She would go it and clean 
up the joint, remove spurs from the rotator cuff, etc. But she couldn't promise 
it result in relieving the pain. I said no. 
(c) I can come in and get a cortisone shot, which is what Smallberg, and also the 
physical therapist recommended. I said yes, and go in tomorrow morning at 10am. 
If ou think there's any reason not to get the shot, let me know. I'm on my cell 
Interesting that Nick Prtizker had the same surgery as me and also has a painful 
shoulder which he can't get rid of. I think my best bet is to find a more 
appropriate sports therapy place. Right now I go one on one with a woman that 
does a little manipulation and gives me exercises for home. Another place I used 
to go to is more like a gym with weights where you actually work out for an hour 
including a few minutes withthe therapist.
