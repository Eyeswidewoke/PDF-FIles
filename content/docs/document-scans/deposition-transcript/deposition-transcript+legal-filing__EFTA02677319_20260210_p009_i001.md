3325 Choreographic Research. Continued 
Faculty: Stenn, Rebecca 
TR 
11:55 AM - 01:25 PM 
Credits: 2 
CRN 4725 See A 
This is a studio practice course that approaches choreography as a practice of research and 
discovery. The course will utilize choreographic and verbal discourse to reflect on each 
participant's assumptions about choreography, as well as the assumptions of its traditions. with 
the goal of assisting each student to formulate her or his own questions, ideas and methods. 
Students will practice a basic research methodology for the creation of movement studies. 
resulting in the creation of a completed group dance at the conclusion of the course Students will 
work both collaboratively and as choreographers authoring their own works, and will learn 
methods to describe, analyze and critique each others choreographic research. Required reading 
and additional research assignments will support the students' studio practice. By design. this 
course is taught by a rotating group of artists currently practicing in the field. giving students the 
opportunity to engage with varied approaches to choreographic research as conceived and 
employed by contemporary practitioners. Course is repeatable with different instructors. 
Prerequisite: Intro to Choreographic Research or Choreography 1.

01:50 PM - 03:30 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 3963 Sec A 
This performance-based course functions as a dance-making work group in which students 
develop original dance works and produce these in a public performance. Required reading and 
additional research assignments explore debates concerning dance criticism. the idea of 
expression, and other topics related to the creative process, assisting students to describe, 
analyze. and critique each others choreographic research. Students workshop their projects in 
class, revising and showing them at least three times before a public presentation.

3020 Designing the Green Economy 
Faculty: Bancrjcc. Lopamudra 
TR 
11:55 AM 01:35 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7331 Sec A 
This seminar examines the notion of environmental sustainability from a trans-disciplinary 
perspective, and explores what designing for a green economy entails from the (often conflicting) 
viewpoints of (a) erypneers, planners. and policy makers. (b) earth scientists and social theorists. 
and (c) environmental-social-political mass movements. The seminar draws upon certain 
fundamental principles of economic analyses to evaluate the alternative designs. In particular, it 
invokes the concepts of efficiency and equity (and fairness) to evaluate the social, economic and 
environmental desirability of these designs. The theory is applied to study the cases of ecosystem 
designs (forests and oceans), structural designs (multipurpose river valley projects and nuclear 
power plants), agrarian designs (GMO crops and land use patterns), and to examine the effects of 
urban/industrial designs in generating environmental pollution. In light of these analyses, the 
seminar revisits the debate on economic growth, human welfare and ecological balance.

A sub-title for this course could have been, in very distinct sottovoce mode. 'and the emergence of 
a mathematical theory of finance'. In this case there are at least five important concepts that 
would require clarification for the course contents to be coherent evolution, finance. institutions. 
emergence, mathematical theory. Although this coherency would be attempted, the main aim of 
the course is a narrative history of the evolution of financial institutions, constructed out of the 
historical examples of the complex evolutionary nexus between capital, finance and money, in 
diverse institutional settings, from about the time of the Fuggers 0 i.C., the Renaissance • to 
modern times. Towards the end of the course, it is hoped that a natural path would have 
emerged, from the narrative history of a complex evolutionary nexus, to tell the story of the 
emergence of a mathematical theory of finance and a vision (in the sense of Schumpetert 
characterization of this notion In the History of Economic Analysis. p. 41. ff.) of the subservience of 
finance theory to a particular ideology of markets as the repository of efficiency in information 
transmission.

CRN 5802 Sec A 
This course introduces students to modem economic methods of modeling social interactions. 
Topics include game theory as a method of conceptualizing social interaction, decision theory, self-
organization of economies and coordination failures, the ideal-type of competitive markets, and its 
limitations, labor market contracts and the role of power in the workplace, and an introduction to
