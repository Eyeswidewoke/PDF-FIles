Important Changes to Your Account Terms 
We are changing the way that we determine your Minimum Payment Due. This change will take effect on October 27, 
2014. We are replacing the first three sentences in the section of your Cardm ember Agreement titled "Your minimum 
payment each month" with the following: 
Each billing cycle, you must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due shown on your monthly statement by its Payment 
Due Date. If the Statement Balance shown on your monthly statement is less than 535, your Minimum Payment Due 
(due by the Payment Due Date) will be that Statement Balance amount. Otherwise, if your Statement Balance is equal 
to or greater than 535, your Minimum Payment Due will be the greater of 535 or the total of ft )2% of the Principal 
Balance (defined as the total Statement Balance minus any interest charges, Returned Payment Fees, and Late Payment 
Fees that are incurred during the current billing cycle), plus (2) interest charges incurred during the current billing cycle 
(for this purpose, interest charges incurred do not include interest charges that accrued during prior billing cycles on a 
deferred interest balance (if there are any on your Account) that ended during the billing cycle covered by the 
statement), plus (3) any Returned Payment Fees and any Late Payment Fees incurred during the current billing cycle, 
plus (4) if your Account has an Annual Fee and if we so elect, a portion of the amount of the Annual Fee (unless you 
have already paid the Annual Fee in full), plus (5) if we so elect, any amount past due and/or amount over your credit 
line at the time of billing.

allow an Authorized User to use your Account, you will be liable for all transactions made by that person including 
transactions for which you may not have intended to be liable, even if the amount of those transactions causes your 
credit line or the spending limit of any Authorized User to be exceeded. You must notify us to revoke your permission 
to allow an Authorized User to use your Account or Card, and you must obtain possession of any Card that has been 
given to the Authorized User. Until you revoke your permission and obtain possession of any Card, you are responsible

given to the Authorized Users. If you request additional Cards for Authorized sers, checks accessing this Account may 
also be included with the Card..
