with the horrific notion of entropy, and the unsettling implication that time is not =eversible at all but, like an arrow, 
moves =nly in one direction. 
A few years ago I would find out on Facebook =hat K had died. She was still quite young. Details were not 
forthcoming =ut my sense is that substance abuse was involved, and a long, difficult =ecline. With the shift to Wall Street 
and his philanthropic engagement =ith cutting-edge scientific research Epstein, of course, travelled an =pposite 
trajectory...at least until he didn't. The images =f Epstein facing the cameras after his conviction are deeply moving, at 
=east to me, due to the horror in his eyes. I do not think any of the =littering personalities who had attended his lavish 
and audaciously =ransgressive soirees in Manhattan in the 1990s, or the annual =illionaire's Dinner hosted by the 
Epstein-supported Edge =ublication—Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Sergei Brin of Google, not =o mention Rupert Murdoch 
and scores of leading scientists in all the =isciplines—made the trek to the Florida penitentiary to pay him = visit during 
the thirteen-months of his incarceration. I very much =oubt his old friend our current president would have been taking 
his =all. But before we let this fact move us to tears, let us not forget =he lasting impact Epstein's actions had on scores 
of vulnerable =oung women. 
The close relationships Epstein cultivated with leading =hysicists and theorists only underscores how deeply 
entangled =ontemporary research is with finance capitalism in its neoliberal mode. =iewed in this context, the issue of 
time links the domains of politics =nd physics to the technological dynamism that now rages like fire. The =ituated, 
embodied fact of death, and its slow, inexorable approach, is =egitimately terrifying, but, of course, pushing it away or 
repressing =t only makes things worse. If you are a scientist and you come to =nderstand this issue as a highly political 
one, you might want ally =ourself with a good political philosopher. This is the step =hysicist Lee =molin 
<http://leesmolin.comh took in 20O6 when he began to work with the =olitical philosopher Roberto Unger 
<http://www.robertounger.com/en/> on the =olitics of time. Together these two thinkers have been exploring the =dea 
of a "singular universe" based in a non-emergent =emporality, and opposed to the "many worlds" theories =urrently in 
vogue. In many worlds theory the paradoxes of quantum wave =unction collapse are resolved by embracing the idea 
that all possible =lternative histories and futures are equally real. Unger and Smolin =mphasize instead that, whatever 
else may be true on the quantum level, =e nevertheless live in a time-bound universe that is steadily and =rreversibly 
evolving from one state to another. To Unger and Smolin =ven physical laws evolve in time, shifting from what they are 
today =oward some new set of intricate alignments, and mathematics =oes not provide us with a perfect mirror =f 
nature. The death-fearing mind recoils from such ideas—even =f mathematical certainties shift on a cosmological time 
scale of =illions of year, the domain of the timeless has been undercut, and this =annot be tolerated. Our affective bonds 
with idea of a-temporal truth =un deep, and the effort to locate the One True Story and a unified =atural law is written 
in blood and backed up by money. 
As I conceded =t the outset, a sexual encounter between K and Epstein may never have =appened—devoid of 
anything resembling evidence I am guided =olely by a sickening "6-degrees" intuition. Perhaps =t's simply how haunted I 
remain by the last time I saw K, which =as during the most challenging portion of my life. In my late twenties = was living 
in Ft. Green in Brooklyn and working for a financial =oftware company writing technical manuals—the 1980s were 
=alloping along in a direction I could not find interesting. At the end =f a long week, dressed in coat and tie, loaded down 
with documents I =arried in a satchel on my shoulder, I caught a glimpse of her in the =rowd on the platform as I 
stepped onto the D-Train, and when I glanced =ack a moment later she was looking at me with a little smile and I said 
=othing and the doors closed. Cowardice? Exhaustion? The bewilderment =nd closure of my own history of trauma? The 
moment reminds me that =egret is all about time—specifically how the arrow of time =eans we can never take it =ack. 
Regret is humbling, and therefore healthy, today most of all. =egardless of our politics we are all implicated anyway. Our 
good =ntentions mean very little. We are participants in the trashing of the =Janet, and we cannot stop because we do 
not see clearly what is driving =s. Herein lies the value of sorcery as a =etaphor for our situation. We believe =urselves to 
be in control—but this is because we =re in a spell. I'm including myself in =his, and K too across the platform too, and 
also all the business =isionaries attending the annual Billionaire's Dinner, and the =ery serious philosophers of 
computation, and the complex systems =esearchers attending too—all of us are stumbling blindly toward =he cliff. 
And what is the source of the spell that has us so firmly in its =rip? An innocuous sorcery object we interact with 
all the time—mo=ey, the coin—that generates a mode of knowing within which its =wn influence becomes invisible...a 
self-cloaking sorcery object. In a time when =oinage—the dynamic forces of money and the financial—fuel=all of our 
various problems (in the domains of politics, the =nvironment, social justice, etc.) is it too much to think the answers =o 
our collective viability as a species involves this ideational aspect =f money—its effects on thought and the secret 
promise it seems =o make? The coin, we come to see, activates psychological and social =ynamics that have drawn us
