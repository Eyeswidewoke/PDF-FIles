Edwards/Bell is no different than Gulfstream service center, neither facilities complete the project on time. 
here is the window install update as of today,. Monday this week I w=s told by Edwards we where on track for 
completion Wednesday evening and go i=to paint shop on Thursday this week. 
I need your direction, are we willing to pay two days of overtime charge for this weekend to complete Bell 430 Sunday 
night? $4,800.00 additional Edwards gave me an estimate of $11,130.00 to install both windshields=20 labor, and I was 
trying to keep to that figure, however, yesterday the=20 manager David Burch whom I've mention during the EFIS deal 
stated he wa= going request additional money for labor since its taking his mechanics longer th=n anticipated to 
complete this installation due to the fact we are installi=g heated bird resistant windshield on captains side, and only 
heated glass windshield on co-pilots side, David Burch stated its harder to shimm the=20 windows when two different 
types of windows are installed. The dual window change is by far the hardest task to accomplish on the Bell 430, plu= 
the "risk of cracking the window" on the first flight, Bell=would have to install another window at their cost, neither 
Edwards or ourselves =ant this to happen, so Edwards is taking their time and making sure the windows are installed 
properly. David Burch has assigned his three best mechanics for this install, this shop is quit small and employs only an 
estimated 11 mechanics. Bell is not willing to pay the weekend overtime, I think its most important to get the 
helicopter=20 completed and ready to fly to St Thomas asap,. here is our two options: 
option #1 
Pay additional $4,800 labor to complete the helicopter Sunday night if=20 Edwards can provide the mechanics to work 
this weekend overtime. I need one=full day for painting the window edge trim piece. 
12th Sunday night window completion, 
13th Monday paint shop, 
14th Tuesday & Wednesday fly to St Thomas arrive by Wednesday night, a lot of tropical activity off the coast of Africa, 
l&#=9;d plan two days to get the 430 to St Thomas could be one day weather dependant, .=20 Wednesday or Thursday 
fly to Zorro to be in position for ABQ/Zorro to NY flight on Saturday the 18th. 
option #2 
No additional money paid for labor to install windows, window install=20 completed on Tuesday 14th or Wednesday 
morning 15th, Paint shop Wednesday=20 night 15th, leave helicopter parked in West Palm Beach until after Gulfstream 
flight to New York. 
18th Fly Gulfstream to NY 
19th airline NY to Palm beach start heli flight to LSJ,. 
20th arrive in St Thomas, 
21st airline to NY in position for Gulfstream departure to LSJ,. 
pls advise option 1 or 2 ? 
Thank You,
