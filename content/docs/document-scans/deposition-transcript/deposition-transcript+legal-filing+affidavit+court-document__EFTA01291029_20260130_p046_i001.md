Please note that the following language supersedes previous versions of our disclosure, Pershing's Impartial Lottery Process: Partial Calls: 
Pershing's Impartial Lottery Process: Partial Calls 
When a security is subject to a partial redemption, pursuant to New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Rule 462.30, which has been incorporated into the FINRA Consolidated Rulebook Pershing must have 
procedures in place that are designed to treat clients fairly in accordance with an impartial lottery process.thlien an issuer initiates a partial call of securities, the depository holding such securities (typically, the 
Depository Trust Clearing and Corporation, or DTCC) conducts an impartial, computerized lottery using an incremental random number technique to determine the allocation of called securities to participants for 
which 4 holds securities on deposit (including Pershing). Because DTCC's lottery is random and impartial, participants may or may not receive an allocation of securities selected for redemption. 
When Pershing is notified that 4 received an allocation of called securities, Pershing conducts a similar, computer-generated random lottery. The lottery determines the accounts that will be selected and the 
number of securities in the account that wt be redeemed. Alocations are based on the number of trading units held in the account. The probability of any trading unit held by an account being selected as called 
in a partial cal is proportional to the total number of trading units held through Pershing. 
Once the lottery is complete, Pershing notifies introducing broker-dealers whose introduced accounts have received an allocation. Securities registered in the clients name, either in transit or held in custody, are 
excluded from the Pershing lottery process. 
Pershing initiates the lottery process by identifying the accounts holding the caNed security, the total par value of the called securities held, and the trading unit of the security. 
Example (unit of trade = 525,000): 
Client Account ABC-123234; Par Value: $100000; Number of Trading Units: 4 
Client Account DEF-325465; Par Value: 575,000; Number of Trading Units: 3
