Trump Supporters Defiantly Protest At Statehouses Nationwide. The Washington
Post (11/7, Knowles, Berman, Miroff, 14.2M) reports activists and other Trump supporters 
"insisted Saturday that the presidential election was not finished, displaying defiance after Joe 
Biden secured victory in the closely fought race." The Post says that from Arizona to 
Pennsylvania, Trump's supporters "echoed the president's attacks on the integrity of the 
election," as they "made baseless allegations of voter fraud and pledged to keep fighting in 
court while claiming Biden did not legitimately win." The Post adds that instead of accepting 
that the media had called the race, the "devotees" of the President "spurned them. They 
gathered at so-called 'Stop the Steal' rallies at state capitols across the country to claim, 
without evidence, that ballot counts favorable to Biden stem from a sprawling, multistate 
conspiracy to hijack the vote through fraud." 
The AP (11/7, Snow, Geller) reports that from Atlanta "and Tallahassee to Austin, 
Bismarck, Boise and Phoenix, crowds ranging in size from a few dozen to a few thousand -
some of them openly carrying guns - decried the news of Joe Biden's victory after more than 
three suspense-filled days of vote-counting put the Democrat over the top." USA Today (11/7, 
Miller, 10.31M) says the protests "were mostly peaceful in the hours after Biden's victory was 
announced. But Trump backers remained defiant." 
Similarly, the New York Times (11/7, Barry, Goodman, Kanno-Youngs, 18.61M) describes 
the President's supporters as responding to reports of Biden's victory "with a combination of 
disappointment and disbelief," although the New York Times (11/7, Barry, 18.61M) highlights 
one family of Trump supporters who "slowly realized" the election "wasn't going" in Trump's 
favor this week. 
Meanwhile, the Washington Times (11/7, Blake, 492K) reports Enrique Tarrio, the 
chairman of the Proud Boys, the group the President "recently told to 'stand back and stand 
by," on Saturday said its members "should consider that order lifted following his projected 
loss" Biden. The Times adds Tarrio "said later on Parler, a social network where he posts, that 
he was referring to protesting and that his original message was being misinterpreted to 
suggest he was calling for violence." However, Reuters (11/7, Layne) reports that more than 50 
Trump supporters this week said they are "willing to give Biden a chance." 
Media Analyses Reflect On Trump's Legacy. In an analysis, the Washington Post 
(11/7, Brockell, 14.2M) says Trump "joined history's club of one-term presidents," who were 
"rejected by the Americans they led." Another Washington Post (11/7, Bump, 14.2M) analysis 
says Trump was "the fourth president in American history to never win the popular vote in a 
presidential election," and it contends he "will leave office having never had majority support of 
any kind from the American public." 
However, the AP (11/7, Colvin, Miller) says that although the President "has fallen back to 
earth," his impact "is likely to resonate for generations in politics, governing and policy, even in 
defeat." The AP adds that until a successor "emerges to lead Republicans - likely not until the 
resolution of the 2024 Republican primary - Trump remains the de facto head of a party that he 
has reshaped in his image." 
In addition, a Washington Post (11/6, Timberg, Dwoskin, 14.2M) analysis concedes that 
Trump "will leave the White House...with a massive social media following that he could use to 
shape the nation's politics throughout his successor's administration and beyond," and Reuters 
(11/7, Tanfani) predicts that Trumpism "will outlast Trump," but Politico (11/7, Kruse, 4.29M) 
highlights that "for the first time in his life, in a public and historic way, he has lost," which will 
leave Trump "fighting against being tagged with a label that he has considered toxic to his 
brand." 
According to Reuters (11/7, Satter, Culliford, Paul), Twitter users "searching for the word 
'loser' on Saturday were greeted with" the President's account, while "searches for 'winner' in 
the same 'People' tab...pointed to the accounts of" Biden and Harris. Reuters adds that Twitter 
"said the results were automatically generated based on how people on the app were using the
