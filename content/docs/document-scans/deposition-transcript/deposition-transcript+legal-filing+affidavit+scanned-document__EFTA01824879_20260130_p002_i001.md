The anticipated diplomatic crisis is not, so far, with Dubai, but with the countries 
whose passports were used by the assassins. The United Kingdom and Ireland 
were used once again, and this time, a French connection topped it off. It is as if 
Israeli governments had never apologized to London for using British 
documentation; as if they had not promised solemnly, when passports of Her 
Majesty's subjects were found in a certain phone booth, that this would never 
happen again. 
This time, they didn't mess with feisty New Zealand. But other countries also do 
not tend to be forgiving of such insolent violations of their sovereignty. Italy, for 
instance, has engaged for the last few years in a merciless attack on the CIA. 
which abducted a suspected Egyptian terrorist on Italian soil (Mordechai Vanunu's 
abduction came decades too early), as well as on its own intelligence agencies, 
which assisted the American one. As soon as the abducted man's wife filed a 
complaint, the Italian judiciary ruled that it could not possibly avoid investigating 
and pressing charges. In Italy, like in Dubai, meticulous work was invested in 
collecting evidence against the suspects, mostly by going through cellular 
communications data and tracing credit card trails in hotels and other businesses. 
But even if whoever carried out the assassination does reach some kind of 
arrangement with the infuriated Western nations, it still has an obligation to its 
own citizens. 
This obligation was violated, thanks to the Mossad - AFMR - and the attorney 
general, whether through action or inaction. 
Using the identities of real, living, innocent Israelis for operational documentation 
is against the law. This kind of abuse also causes innocent civilians to suffer the 
evil that already plagues ministers and officers: being prevented from traveling 
abroad for fear of being arrested by Interpol on suspicion of being the Dubai 
assassins. 
Former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy pushed for a Mossad Law to be legislated 
that would enshrine the state's obligation to defend its agents caught breaking 
laws abroad. The initiative never got off the ground: A state can't legitimize 
illegality. But neither can it allow one of its institutions to arbitrarily harm civilians 
not the police, not 
the tax authority, not the Shin Bet security service and not the Mossad. 
Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein was asked yesterday whether an 
investigation will be opened following the public complaints of those whose 
identities were stolen from them, and whose lives and liberty are therefore now 
threatened. Weinstein has not yet had time to study the issue. He has some 
superficial knowledge of Dagan's character, but no prejudice. 
Netanyahu played deaf to the warnings and extended Dagan's tenure for an 
eighth year, a decision as hasty as it was unnecessary. But the Mossad, like the 
Jerusalem District Attorney's Office, cannot hinge upon one man, without whom 
everything would collapse. 
What is needed now is a swift decision to terminate Dagan's contract and to 
appoint a new Mossad chief - one of the current department heads, one of their 
predecessors, or a talented Israel Defense Forces general. There's no disease 
(AFMR) without a cure: An easel in Rosh Pina is yearning for pensioner Dagan to 
come home.
