That is terrible that ASU sent t=e report to Mel Thomson and horrible that she 
distributed it. Don'= these people have any serious battles to fight? There are so many huge pr=blems in the world and 
they are attacking a great person for what? Trivia.=lt is trivial. 
Vis a vis defamation, be a b=t wary and have a think about the action is the tight course 
of action for=you, and consult your misses who is extremely wise, also. 
</=iv> 
On the one hand if you can prove this woman lied, you may win a de=amation case 
against her. 
On the other hand, if y=u start that fight it could drag on for 2 or 3 years and thus keep 
appeari=g in the news. Worse she could make extravagant claims and make demands in=the Discovery process which 
would then get wide and repeated coverage. 
Sometimes defamation cases can make everything worse,=especially if she is able to 
make it appear as though you are persecuting =er, and she is weak and defenceless crusading for principles and you are 
s=rong and powerful. 
That would make it all worse.<=div> 
On the other hand if you can prove she is a malici=us actor who really had it in for you 
and can successfully win the PR war =s well as the legal battle then it may be worth it. 
Ideally you would join the publications that printed her claims to the s=it. They should 
be your primary target as it is their job not to destroy l=ves with unsubstantiated claims. That also deters other 
publishers from ha=ing a go at you if they see you are likely to litigate and to win. 
ASU determining against you complicates matters as people=can print what they have 
determined in their report. However they are not = court. Are you able to take legal action against ASU in a court? 
You need to appeal that decision and preferably take legal=action against ASU. I am not 
sure how or under what legislation that could=fall. But i think that universities must be bound by some sort of laws 
not=to unfairly dismiss or find against staff because their internal processes=are not courts. If laws are broken we have 
courts to deal with them. This =s extra-judicial. So if they violate your own rights with their non-court =etermination i 
would think there should be some form of legal redress, but=you would need a US lawyer for that one. 
I think =ou need to attack this issue at the root 
I would =ay nothing publicly until you have all your ducks in a row. 
=/div> 
I would first appeal the ASU verdict and hit that with everythin=. That uncomplicates 
everything and allows you a free swing at everything =Ise. 
Because these things take time, i would ask =he good defamation lawyer in Australia 
(just pay the money and get the bes= advice) about whether you can file against the publishing houses that pub=ished 
the false claims by wand then just add her on to the suit (but do=t make it about her) 
With the point about it bein= someone you had met before and not a stranger in the 
selfie, i would not =ely on this point as it is not really relevant to the case and she can jus= say "i was mistaken it wasnt a 
malicious lie" and then sh= is off the hook on that point. Just stick to the actual best points, numb=r 5 sounds promising.
