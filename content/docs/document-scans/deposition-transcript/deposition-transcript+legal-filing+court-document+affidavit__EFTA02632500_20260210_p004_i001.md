not know what =ash was on the balance sheet when you bought =t. 
The open gate transaction to summarize 
=nbsp;was a stepping into your shoes for only 6 million or roughly =he same as the current offer. taking out cash 14 of 
the 15 =il which has not come out. and even on your calculation of 8 cash =ould mean 3.2 to you back then... and then 
leveraging the bit = the liability to the buyer was no where near that to golden =ate. sorry.. . We can go back and 
forth on comps and =an show mom and pop at 1 to 3 cc-apple-data-detectors:Hi> times =bitda.. so lets try to short 
circuit a tiresome uncessary =xcercise, as i see it the current bid offer is 5 bid and =pprox 9.2 offer. open gates 6 + 3.2 
from 2 =ears ago with more growth potential and lower cash out. multiples =rom before digital photos and amazon. 
sorry 
I am suprised =hat you would inflate current Ebitda, pull multiples from many =ears ago to biz that are 
tangential. leave out liabilites even of =awsuits that you know about, and then pick a cash number to =ubtract for 
enterprise value. If I have misunderstood and you are not =eally sellers then I will not be insulted if you decide to cancel 
our =all.

Richard, 
Not funny at all, just =actual. 
I think if we are to ultimately agree on =alue it will be important we agree on a 
set of facts: 
1. 
TTM EBITDA is $6.7Million. If you =isagree, please let us know precisely 
what items you disagree with in =he number and we can discuss. 
2. 
The current cash balance for the company =s $13.1 Million. 
3. 
The past three comparable transactions for =ompanies in this market 
average an enterprise value at —10x multiple of =BITDA 
a. 
Wilhelmina: 7x (average meaningful trading =ultiple since 2010) 
b. 
Creative Artists Agency: 10x (TPG =cquisition, 2014) 
c. 
IMG: 13x (WME acquisition, =013) 
4. 
We invested $18 million for a 42% stake in =he business, implying an 
enterprise value of $42.9 million. 
5. 
We received a bona fide offer from =penGate Capital which would have 
resulted in $18 million in proceeds =or us (and in fact a $17 million distribution to Faith and Joel), and =hile they were, as 
you point out, contemplating leverage in the =It;3x EBITDA range, it is in fact a relevant data point and an =ndependent 
look at value. 
6. 
One other note that is relevant to us, is =hat when Elite Models in Europe 
contacted us with an interest in buying =he company, Faith told me to relay to them that they would not =ontemplate 
selling to Elite for less than $100 million (which at the =ime was a +10x synergy-adjusted EBITDA value). Ultimately they 
=alked based on that value requirement. 
for =alue: 
I would hope you agree =hat the following is a commonly agreed upon formula 
a. 
Enterprise value = EBITDA x Market =ultiple
