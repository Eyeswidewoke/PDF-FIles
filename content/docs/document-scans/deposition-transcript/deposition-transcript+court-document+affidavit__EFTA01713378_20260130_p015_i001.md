• Billionaires Are Free - The Money Guide -- New York Magazine 
Page 2 of 5 
Jerry Yang and David Fib came by. Another night in the fall, Sergey Brin and Larry Page were there. 
Supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle, Virgin head Richard Branson, and Steve Bing, the down-to-earth 
Democratic donor who inherited nearly a billion dollars from his real-estate-magnate grandfather, the 
developer of some of the most beautiful Art Deco buildings on Park Avenue and the West Village. Advance 
men for President Clinton. Few other guys can get in, except for a couple of model wranglers, those 
handsome, usually South American guys who round up models at their apartments and herd them to 
nightclubs. Promoter Danny A., a friend of Ron Burkle's, runs this place—he even got to go on a trip to Israel 
with President Clinton. The wranglers are the only people in here not having fun: One hand on a mojito, they 
are nervous as they text madly on the phone to more girls, more girls, more girls. 
For the rest of the city, the door is closed. A few handsome bankers wait on the sidewalk outside the club for a 
half-hour, scraping their shoes. "I guess I'm a zero-value-added person in this equation," says one, stepping 
away, disappointed. 
At the very pinnacle of the New York social scene these days is the billionaire, once a reclusive character who 
secretively moved world markets from his castle on the hill but now is more likely to be dining at a booth next 
to you. They're everywhere: This year, for the first time, everyone on the Forbes 400 list was a billionaire, up 
from thirteen billionaires in the early eighties. One can imagine them, swathed in Pyrex, looking down from 
their apartments in new designer buildings at our tenement buildings and bobbing umbrellas, as though the 
world outside were some vast boho terrarium. 
Now that it seems you need a million dollars just to stay alive, the cultural imagination has been captured by 
a billion. "I've met six billionaires!" crowed a friend of mine, counting them on his hands, and then correcting 
himself—"Seven!" Our mayor, of course, is a billionaire five times over, with seven homes, a few worth sin 
million, and a Florida estate he bought for his daughter to strengthen her equestrian training. Over brunch 
on a recent Sunday, my girlfriends and I chatted about their Saturday night out—this one talked to one of the 
Dells; that one sat next to Stewart Rahr, the pharmaceutical mogul and owner of the most expensive home in 
the Hamptons; and everyone saw Ian Schrager. 
"He's not a billionaire!" huffed one of my friends, outraged at our ignorance. 
To be a billionaire is to be radically free. You are your own galaxy. You make your own rules, hang out with 
the former• president, send tourists to space. Billionaire investor Jeffrey Epstein, who lives in the largest 
dwelling in Manhattan, a 51,00o-square-foot palace on 71st Street—though his business, naturally, is located 
on a 7o-acre private island in the Virgin Islands—was humiliated this summer when his lifestyle was made 
public. Epstein was known to be a womanizer: He usually travels with three women, who are "strictly not of 
our class, darling," says a friend. They serve his guests dinner on his private 727, and are also there for 
touching. 
But it seems that he was also interested in younger women: Over the past few years, a then-17-year-old Olive 
Garden waitress, 
, brought at least five high-school girls between the ages of 14 and 16 over to 
Epstein's house in Palm Beach to "massage" him, which meant watching him masturbate and even allegedly 
having sex. Epstein's defense seems to be that he didn't know the girls were minors, and that he is "very 
passionate about massage," as one of his lawyers says.
