Epstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four 
and 
al
-figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be 
charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties, 
worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily 'massages' was stocked with fresh recruits. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-bom press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years 
Epstein's live-in partner, also recruited young girls. 
Since his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits 
brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each 
received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth. 
The victims told police they wafted in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave 
them a bite to eat. House manager 
said in his sworn statement that a maid named 
who was 
a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled 
towels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of 
him with a young girl. 
Ironically, a 
who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced to more jail 
time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein's activities. He was fired, he says, for 
inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money. 
He saw an unfamiliar "beater" in the driveway one evening and called 911. When he left Epstein's employ, 
took away some notes and emails about massage appointments as "protection" against his own prosecution, and 
failed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation. 
Unable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, a 
later tried to sell this "golden 
nugget"—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an 
undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with 'obstruction of official proceedings" for withholding information 
that could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal. 
was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach 
county jail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal cowl in Miami for transporting firearms, 
another deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job. 
In a deposition given for the civil suits, 
testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000 in cash on 
hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as 
who brought them 
to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in 
retum was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by 
local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition, acknowledged that, In addition to earlier 
donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given 
the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The police were still researching the purchase when 
Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein's local attorneys, 
told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was "very passionate" 
about massages being "therapeutically and spiritually" beneficial. Yet victims told poke they had no massage 
training.) 
Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with 
owner 
of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida, en alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, 
and
 'deliberately engaged in a 
pattem of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in 
sexual play for money." (Which would amount to trafficking.)
