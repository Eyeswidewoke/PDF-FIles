I don't know how our recollection of events can be so different. 
In my view you offered no guidance or help with difficult decisions when Ball-e was pregnant and 
in labor. You placated me by repeating I can do what I want because it's my dog. To questions 
you responded without giving it thought with 5 contradicting answers so when I pick X and 
something goes wrong, you can then say 'I told you to do Y'. 
You left to NYC and didn't answer your phone when she was giving birth while Story stayed on 
the phone with me throughout the night. I was terrified about anything going wrong and I made 
decisions not based on Story's opinion, but the vet's. I hope we can at least agree I absolutely 
wanted to do what was best for Ball-c and had no other motivation. You made no decisions, 
waited for the result of mine and then lectured me about what I did wrong. Well, at that point I 
could see it for myself and don't need anyone to point out the mistakes. Regarding Fatt-e you 
were unfortunately again not available during the critical moments and I had to make decisions by 
myself about where to take her and what to do. You clearly had no control over it and I am not 
suggesting you left me without help on purpose. You were very helpful and kind once you landed. 
I did the best I could and there was nothing irresponsible or reckless about my decisions. I do feel 
guilty for not being home for the few hours before you left when something happended to Fatt-e. 
For the record, I am not suggesting you are responsible for anything that happend with the dogs 
at all. They were fully my responsibility. You were not involved and I realize the mistakes that 
were made. What I am saying is that you are not in a position to discipline me about it or blame 
me for what happened

I will help you with watching Balle/ It concerns me that you still have not learned that your 
responsibilities are yours „ not the people around you. I feel sorry re Fatte. it was unfortunately 
inevitable. You took my gift to you. probably the best dog i have seen, treated it carelessly or 
recklessly. I told you the moment I saw Peabo to get rid of it. you chose not to. I specifically 
told you i didnt want Balle pregnant as it would change her personality which was unique. If you 
refused to do as i asked and you had the right to breed her, but it should be with a champion 
blood line, you chose not to. I asked you to give it away to someone other than your 
grandfather, you chose not to. , You took balle and were careless with peabo around. 
Irresponsible , When she was diagosed as pregnant ,you made a big showing buying all the 
equiptmnet , so it could give birth in the house. you had gloves all the stuff you wanted, however 
when push came to shove , you told me story advised you and , you turned over the best dog to 
people you didnt know at all„ left the dog with the lowest forms of life , and the result is the 
result. you then are both carelsss and reckless with keeping the last dog under close supervision. 
you take it to a place where you dont know anyone, get sold a bullshit story , buy in like you do
