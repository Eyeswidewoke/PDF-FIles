flatten the curve. Birx said, "Your absolute case number's extraordinarily high, your rate of 
hospitalization is extraordinarily high, and we know what follows that is a high rate of fatalities. 
... We're really asking people in this moment to do everything they can to save their own life 
and the lives of those that they love." 
Asked on WISN-TVVI Milwaukee (11/12, 87K) about potential restrictions on bars and 
restaurants, Birx said, "We know that anytime people take their mask off indoors, that it can 
create a spreading event...and it's very difficult to eat and drink with a mask on, and so 
Wisconsin really needs to consider additional tightening, at least either close early, decrease 
capacity, and really, I don't know of a situation where at this point in Wisconsin that bars are 
safe." 
In an appearance on WFRV-TVVi Green Bay, WI (11/12, 28K), Birx cited superspreader 
events and a number of asymptomatic cases as major drivers of the state's spike. Birx said, 
"It's no one's fault. They don't know they're infected. I know it's difficult to comprehend that 
there's a virus out there that can cause no symptoms in some and hospitalizations and deaths 
in others, and long-term consequences in others." She "says to flatten the curve, Wisconsin has 
to stop superspreader events and...stay home." 
US COVID Infections Topped 150K Thursday; States See Surge In Hospitalizations. 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (11/12, lead story, 4:00, O'Donnell, 4.06M) reported, "America will 
soon be facing a coronavirus emergency more severe and potentially more deadly than when 
the pandemic first began. The country isn't just breaking records. It's blowing through them, 
reaching new highs again tonight in cases and hospitalizations. ... There are few words to 
describe the staggering size or depressing depth of the crisis. In just three weeks, the number 
of new infections recorded each day in the US has doubled," and "Americans are now dying 
each day at levels not seen since the worst months of the pandemic." ABC World News Tonight 
Vi (11/12, lead story, 4:50, Muir, 6.57M) reported hospitalizations also nearly doubled "in just 
two weeks." 
On NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/12, lead story, 2:30, Holt, 4.9M), Miguel Almaguer said, "As 
the US skyrockets above yet another astonishing single day record for new COVID cases, 
doctors tracking the pandemic since March are equally alarmed by the steady and seemingly 
unstoppable waves of infections, now surging off the charts. With 46 states seeing a rise in 
cases," on Thursday "the Chicago mayor issued a stay-at-home advisory," and "governors 
across the nation are also pleading for the public to take precautions." The Wall Street Journal 
(11/12, Al, Levitz, Ansari, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports the governors of New York, 
Utah, Maryland, Iowa, and Minnesota, among other states, are imposing new measures aimed 
at curbing rising COVID infection numbers. 
CNBC (11/12, Feuer, 3.62M) reports on its website that "average daily new cases are up 
by at least 5% over the last week in at least 47 states and DC as of Wednesday, according to a 
CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University." 
The New York Times (11/12, Smith, 18.61M) reports, "Eight days after 100,000 US cases" 
of COVID infections "were found in a day for the first time, the number topped 150,000 on 
Thursday." The pandemic "has risen to crisis levels in much of the nation, especially the 
Midwest, as hospital executives warn of dwindling bed space and as coroners deploy mobile 
morgues." Over "100,000 coronavirus cases have been announced nationwide every day since 
Nov. 4, and six of the last nine days have broken the previous record." Hospitalizations "also set 
a record on Thursday, climbing to 67,096, according to the Covid Tracking Project. It was the 
third straight day of record numbers, and the figure has doubled in just five weeks." 
Study Finds COVID Death Rate Down 30% Since April. The AP (11/12, Murphy) 
reports, "Deaths per day in the US have soared more than 40 percent over the past two weeks, 
from an average of about 790 to more than 1,100 as of Wednesday, the highest level in three 
months." This is "still well below the peak of about 2,200 deaths per day in late April, in what
