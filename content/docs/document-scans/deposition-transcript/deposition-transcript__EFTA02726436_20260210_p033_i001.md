' 
A. You damn right. 
3 
Q. What, what has happened to you since you filed 
4 
this lawsuit that's traumatic? 
5 
A. Psychologically messed me all up in my head. 
6 
Okay. here's, here's a young girl 13-years-old of age 
7 
going and taking myself every single day to a man's 
8 
house, okay, to show my body, to show my vagina, to show 
9 
my, my boobs, you how, that I hardly didn't even have. 
10 
Okay. 
11 
Andl would bring all these girls and I would 
12 
beg them, come on, come on, we're going to make 5200. 
13 
am psychologically fucked up in the head from that. Now 
14 
I feel so incredibly bad that 1 brought any of these 
15 
little girls there. It's sickening. 
16 
Okay. I have got to live with this for the 
17 
rest of my life. That man right there he has shown me 
18 
that later on in life, all I've got to do is show a 
19 
little bit of vagina and a little bit of fucking boobs 
20 
so I can make some money. And now for the rest of my 
21 
life,1 have got to try to keep from my son that his 
22 
mother was a prostitute to put bread and butter on the 
23 
table for him.
