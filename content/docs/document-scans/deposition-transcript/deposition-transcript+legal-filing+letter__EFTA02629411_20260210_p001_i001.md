Good morning, Sir, 
I understand that some =ssues regarding your personal space have been a disappointment. I will add=ess your 
concerns with top priority. Carlos has already been instructed to=purchase the hinges and Karen has provided 
instructions for the master. 
With little notice or direction, Mike, Patrick, and = picked up the ball and kept things moving forward the best 
we knew how. 1= a month's time we three have been doing what six people used to do an= we have made visible 
progress. I don't think we need more leadership.=We need more skilled labor and contractors. You have given us the go 
to fi=d it, so we will. With practice we expect exponential progress. We've =ot this. 
Plans are in place to address the h=nges and master straight away. We have steps in place for the tiki and 
alr=ady know what needs to be done. 
I am glad to have=met Anna. I'm happy to spend time with her and to learn from her and a=k her for help. I ask 
that you let me set the course for what she does her= so that she's not in the middle of projects we already have lined 
out= For example, she went to GSJ after she left here yesterday and upset Bria= when she interjected herself in the dock 
wood collection for the tiki pro=ect. Everything was already in place for that, but Mike had to take that p=nicked call 
from Brian and contact others to straighten it back out. Time =s precious. This was frustrating for Mike. When she pulled 
crew, a boat, a=captain, and machinery for the GSJ road project and I had NO IDEA this was=coming, it completely threw 
a wrench into everything we had already lined =ut for that week. I was EXTREMELY frustrated because I plan and work 
EFFIC=ENTLY. 
Sir, you asked me what the most chal=enging part of this job has been. It has been the lack of clarification to=all 
about who is in charge and the consequential challenge of triangulatio= that occurs. One person needs to be your 
manager. Your manager should be =t your right hand and consequently responsible for being the conduit of in=ormation 
and disseminating responsibilities with your priorities at the forefront. Regardless of who you choose long-term for this 
responsibility, th= triangulation has to stop in order for that person to be successful. This=means when people try to go
