who struggles. 
Dr. Sjuggerud says if you own any US "paper" as=ets - and that includes stocks, bonds, or just cash in a bank 
account 4>=800 you should be aware of what's 
about to happen and know how to prepare. A=number of experts believe a recent spike in gold and silver prices 
is a di=ect result of the IMF's action. Precious metals notoriously =ise when the US dollar falls. 
=he Death of the US Dollar in One Frightening Graph 
For the last 600 years, there have been six different =lobal reserve currencies controlled by world superpowers. 
The latest 0=800 the US dollar — has dominated world currency for over 80 yea=s. The alarming fact is, global 
reserve currencies have collapsed every 80-90 years for the =ast six centuries! What does this mean for America 
and the dominance of th= US dollar? Based on recent evidence and long-standing historical trends,<=div> 
experts predict th= imminent collapse of the US dollar! What's more alarming? Many Am=ricans aren't yet doing 
the one thing that will save their savings=& retirement from US dollar collapse. 
Just take a look at the graph below. It shows the lifespan of d=minant currencies going back 600 years. Notice 
that the US dollar has now =een the dominant currency for 88 years, about the same length of time as i=s predecessors. 
<=r> 
It's o=vious why experts say that the US dollar's days as the world*=99s reserve currency are coming to a 
climactic end. 
All Fiat Currencies Collapse 
"Fiat" currency is paper currency backe= by nothing tangible. As opposed to "sound money" which is=backed by 
gold or some other valuable commodity, a fiat currency is backed=by nothing more than faith in the government. The US 
dollar has been a fia= currency since Nixon closed the gold window in 
1971 in what was the greatest heist in Ameri=an history. The scary fact is, the average life span of a fiat currency 
is=40 years, and the US dollar 
has now exceeded 40 years as a fiat currency! 
Prior to 1933 and for well over 100 years, the do=lar was backed by gold, and $20 bought you an ounce of gold. 
But after the=government stole all US citizens' gold in 1933 for a $20 paper cer=ificate, gold was revalued at US$35, 
meaning the dollar was devalued by 43= overnight and all foreign and domestic holders of dollars were effectivel= 
robbed. 
After Nixon closed th= gold window completely in 1971, it took $67 to buy an ounce of gold, deva=uing the US 
dollar by 5O% again. Today, it takes well 
over a thousand US dollars to buy that=same ounce of gold. Why? Because 
the US dollar is now nothing more than a fast-declining Fed=ral Reserve note backed by a corrupt government 
that is saddled with $18 t=illion in 
unpayab=e debt — growing by $10 million per minute! 
Protect Yourself Before It's Too Late 
This "Paper Money Experiment=E2** has run its course. The Federal Reserve, the US government, and W=ll 
Street crooks have misused their power by 
mismanaging the dollar, and now there are globa= repercussions. The debt load sitting on top of the US dollar is 
unsustain=ble and will continue to crush the dollar's purchasing power until=no one wants to hold US dollars, and they 
are _no longer_ accepted for glo=al trade. The dollar's collapse means that every single one of you= paper investments 
that are dollar-backed
