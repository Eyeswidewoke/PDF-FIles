1868, p. 561)" 
"Marat collected butterflies" ... "From 
the aesthetic point of view, the tapeworm is certainly an 
undesirable boarder. The gravid segments frequently crawl out 
of a person's anal canal, sometimes in chains, and have been 
reported a source of social embarrassment." (Ann. N. Y. 
Acad. Sci. 48:558). 
What inspires you to record and collect such 
disconnected impressions and quotations? 
All I know is that at a very early stage of the novel's 
development I get this urge to garner bits of straw and fluff, 
and eat pebbles. Nobody will ever discover how clearly a bird 
visualizes, or if it visualizes at all, the future nest and the 
eggs in it. When I remember afterwards the force that made me 
jot down the correct names of things, or the inches and tints 
of things, even before I actually needed the information, I am 
inclined to assume that what I call, for want of a better term, 
inspiration, had been already at work, mutely pointing at this 
or that, having me accumulate the known materials for an 
unknown structure. After the first shock of recognition-- a 
sudden sense of "this is what I'm going to write"-- the 
novel starts to breed by itself; the process goes on solely in 
the mind, not on paper; and to be aware of the stage it has 
reached at any given moment, I do not have to be conscious of 
every exact phrase. I feel a kind of gentle development, an 
uncurling inside, and I know that the details are there 
already, that in fact I would see them plainly if I looked 
closer, if I stopped the machine and opened its inner 
compartment; but I prefer to wait until what is loosely called 
inspiration has completed the task for me. There comes a moment 
when I am informed from within that the entire structure is 
finished. All I have to do now is take it down in pencil or 
pen. Since this entire structure, dimly illumined in one's 
mind, can be compared to a painting, and since you do not have 
to work gradually from left to right for its proper perception, 
I may direct my flashlight at any part or particle of the 
picture when setting it down in writing. I do not begin my 
novel at the beginning. I do not reach chapter three before I 
reach chapter four, I do not go dutifully from one page to the 
next, in consecutive order; no, I pick out a bit here and a bit 
there, till I have filled all the gaps on paper. This is why I 
like writing my stories and novels on index cards, numbering 
them later when the whole set is complete. Every card is 
rewritten many times. About three cards make one typewritten 
page, and when finally I feel that the conceived picture has 
been copied by me as faithfully as physically possible-- a few 
vacant lots always remain, alas-- then I dictate the novel to 
my wife who types it out in triplicate. 
In what sense do you copy "the conceived 
picture" of a novel?
