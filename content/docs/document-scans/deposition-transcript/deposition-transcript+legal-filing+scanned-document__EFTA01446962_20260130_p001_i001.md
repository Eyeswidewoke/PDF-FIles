Wireless Equipment 
Signals to Noise (S2N) 
ever (strictly Android open source code with no integration into Google), but the 
strategic questions of this maneuver overshadowed any attributes that the device may 
have had. What was most worrisome, was that a cursory look around hall 7, where 
many of the Chinese-based OEMs resided, revealed smartphones that were at least as 
feature rich as any the major OEM design houses were carrying. Many even had 
wearables to go alongside them. All of this points to a market that is continually being 
commoditized, at least on the hardware side - a suggestion that has been made years 
before, but a theme that is now so palpable at the show it is hard to ignore. 
The good news for many across the globe is that smartphones are only getting cheaper. 
Firefox took this one step further, introducing a S25 smartphone at the show. The 
phone runs on a 1 Ghz application processor and has a Spreadtrum Edge baseband and 
WiFi connectivity. We were able to demo the device, which we felt was a large 
improvement on the year before, when they had the OS (which is based on HTML-5) 
running on a more expensive 800 mhz processor. Overall, we feel as though Firefox is 
moving in the right direction with this OS, towards the masses with the hope to migrate 
these initial customers to more expensive devices in the future. Just in terms of buzz, 
the Firefox booth was constantly packed with people and had moved from the 
hinterlands of hall 8 up to hall 3, where many of the bigger companies were located. It 
appears the thirst for anything non-Android or non-iOS is significant, and as long as 
Firefox continues to refine its solution, and target the low-end, we feel there should be 
an encouraging reception there. 
Ubuntu was also there as an alternative to Android or iOS. Last year, the company 
appeared to have the most complete OS offering of any of the three main alternatives - 
Tizen being the third. During the past year, the company has been able to sign up a 
number of both operators and hardware vendors, and while the OS is aimed more at 
the mid- to high-end than Firefox or Tizen, the OS is also the most unique. The buzz was 
comparable to last year, which was to say it was decent and relatively less notable than 
Firefox. Regardless, we believe it could have legs given that so many in the entire 
mobile ecosystem would like to see more players. 
The show was lacking in terms of "wow" factors from the handset side. However, there 
were a few mobile applications that caught our attention. Metaio, a company which has 
an augmented reality solution, was showing off some very interesting use cases; one 
from Ikea was demonstrating pulling items like furniture from a physical catalog, onto a 
3D imaging sensor attached to a smartphone or tablet and placing the item into your 
home (viewed through the tablet screen) so you can see what it would look like in your 
home; another, using 3D glasses, used 3D images to augment the physical world to 
walk a repairman through the steps they needed to perform to repair an air conditioner. 
The company has been in existence for almost ten years - the technology was originally 
formed at Volkswagen. The idea of the technology is becoming more mainstream and 
Metaio could be one of the key beneficiaries given how advanced the solution appears. 
The other player in this space is Qualcomm, which for some time now has promoted its 
augmented reality platform Vuforia. The difference between the two is that Metaio has 
a solution and is adapting it to customer use cases, whereas Qualcomm has a platform 
and is looking for app developers to do the consumer facing. In either case, the 
technology in general is very interesting and we think it could easily be adopted by 
consumers in significant fashion, all the while increasing demand for data across the 
network. We expect augmented reality to be one of the major themes in next years 
MWC as a major handset vendor could launch a smartphone and/or tablet with an 
integrated 3D image sensor in front of the show. 
Handset hardware appeared more iterative from our standpoint. One company we met 
with, Skycross, has developed an antenna solution for 4X4 MIMO, a seemingly simple
