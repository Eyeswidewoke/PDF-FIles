Subject: Re: taxes 
Just back from a couple of days in E=gland, packed with talks, interviews and the rest. Valeria and I had thought 
of staying on for a few days for ourselves, but we can't manage that th=se days, due to very intense commitments. 
Turning to your letter, about the fa=ily relationship, we can put that aside. That's stable, enduring, 
permanent.=font size="3"> 
The rest of the letter, however, I f=nd puzzling. I'll explain. And these are matters we ought to clear up. 
You say that there is "some major disagreement about what the basic facts are" and that there is a difference of 
perspectives. That&=39;s what I find puzzling. I don't know of any disagreement about the basic facts, and I know of 
only one perspective: the one I outlined in my letters. I reported what the facts are -• will review the matter briefly 
again below -- and outlined my perspective, based on the only relev=nt facts I know of, which to my knowledge are 
complete. I'm not awa=e of any other relevant facts, hence see no basis for any other perspective (whatever that 
perspective may be). 
If I'm missing some facts, basic or not, I'd of course like to be a=are of them, and also of the source for them so 
that I can check and discover on what the picture is based. But since I haven't heard of any ot=er facts beyond those I 
outlined (and more that simply fill out the same pictu=e), I don't understand the disagreement and don't see any 
alternative p=rspective. And I don't understand the suggestion about an outside "expert."=C24kIn fact, find the 
suggestion very strange, and would even if there were some factual basis for it. Even stranger when there is no factual 
basis, as far as I am aware -- and if there is, again, I'd like to know what i= is and, crucially, what is the source. So far I 
haven't seen anyt=ing. 
To review the basic facts briefly, M=mmoy and I worked out the estate planning a long time ago, with Eric 
Menoyo and (later) Palmer Dodge when he moved there. Our general plan at that time, about 20 years ago, was for 
everything to go to you after the two of us died. We took for granted that M would survive me. Therefore, putting 
aside the trusts designated specifically for you, the rest (apart from IRAs) was put in trusts in M's name for her to acc=ss 
for the rest of her life. The intention, of course, was that these would be accessible to the survivor — and we took for 
granted that = would survive me. 
Things didn't turn out as we=expected. It turned out, contrary to our assumptions, that I was the survivor, not 
M. And when I remarried, things changed again. Because the pension went almost entirely into M's trust, what remains 
of the pe=sion is very small, actually less than Social Security. And, importantly, it doesn't go to Valeria after my death. 
And I have no access to the tr=sts, only to one IRA (and another small one).
