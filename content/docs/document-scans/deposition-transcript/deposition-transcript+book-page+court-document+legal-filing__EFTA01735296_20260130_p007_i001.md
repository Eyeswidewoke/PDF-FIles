dialogue with the prosecutors' office voluntarily offering to undergo interrogation in a number of ways from 
London, all of which were refused. 
The lawyer also complained that it is now difficult for his client to receive a fair trial as he had not been provided 
with all the evidence against him, including important exculpatory evidence. He gives as an example the witness 
Goran Rudling, from whom the court had heard the previous day. He only knows this evidence because Mr 
Rudling has contacted the defence. Such evidence as he has seen has not been translated into English. He also 
gave evidence that the European Arrest Warrant is for "Iagforing" which means legal process and does not 
properly translate into English as "for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution". 1-le says that the 
prosecutor has consistently and repeatedly said that she has not yet decided whether to prosecute. They only 
want to hear his side of the story. He went on to give evidence about the law in Sweden as it relates to sexual 
crimes. Under Swedish law a prosecutor may investigate the case and even bring it to trial, where there is no, or 
no sufficient, evidence of lack of consent. 
The lawyer gave live evidence coveting in some detail the attempts made to secure an interview with his client. 
On 15th September Ms Ny told him there were no "force measures" preventing Julian leaving the country, i.c. he 
was allowed to leave. He asked when his client would be interrogated but was told the officer she needed for the 
investigation was sick. He phoned his client to say he was free to leave the country• to continue his work. His 
client was worried that he may be difficult to get hold of, so they agreed that when he had found a stable place 
he would contact his lawyer. On 22thd September he received a text message from Marianne Ny saying that she 
wanted to interrogate Julian Assange on 28th September. "I could not get hold of Julian, which I told Marianne 
on 27th September." He was able to speak to his client on 29th September and Mr Assange offered to return on 
Saturday 9th October for interrogation. Eventually this proposal was not accepted as the dates were too far away. 
He gives details about a proposal to hold an interrogation on 6th October, which he believes was because the 
police thought his client would be in Sweden then giving a lecture. That information was leaked to him. On 8th 
October Mr Hurtig suggested a telephone interrogation, but this was refused. He provided further detail about 
the evidence he had seen on 17th November and on 18th November before the detention hearing which was 
decided on 24th November. However there was nothing in English. He was allowed to read text messages but 
not allowed to make notes or copy them. The text messages were "not good for the claimants and spoke of 
revenge". They also spoke of gaining money from Julian Assangc. The complainant's statement is confidential. 
Therefore Mr Hurtig sought the advice of the prosecutor and then the Bar Council before disclosing it. He was 
advised that he could. In the statement the alleged victim of the rape allegation said she was half-asleep at the 
time. That is very different from the allegation in the EAW. 
In cross-examination the Swedish lawyer confirmed that paragraph 13 of his proof of evidence is wrong. The last 
five lines of paragraph 13 of his proof read: "in the following days [after 15th September] I telephoned [Ms Ny] a 
number of times to ask whether we could arrange a time for Mr Assange's interview but was never given an 
answer, leaving me with the impression that they may close the rape case without even bothering to interview 
him. On 27th September 2010, Mr Assange left Sweden." He agreed that this was wrong. Ms Ny did contact
