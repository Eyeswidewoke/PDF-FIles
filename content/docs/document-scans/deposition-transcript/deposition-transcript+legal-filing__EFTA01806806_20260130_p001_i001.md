Fw: The question i wanted to ask myla 
Hi Babe, 
Just got this mail from Laura in Virginia concerning care for her mother=in England,- I think I already mentioned it. If you 
can take a minute to r=ad thru it. I realise it is probably nearly impossible for you to or=anise anything while you are 
working even if you did know someone. Do you have any idea as to the process to ob=ain visa's or work permits for 
someone from the philippines so I can give =aura some idea of what is involved? I guess I will have to give her a repl= of 
some sort to her request. From what I understand, it would be a long, difficult process to get work clear=nce for 
someone who has never been out of the Philippines. The only other =ption I can think of is someone already outside the 
Philippines looking fo= a (probably) temporary job, most likely fairly low pay. Let me knoe if you can think of anyone. 
<=p> 
Love, Phil

Hi Phil, 
Thanks for your email & hope=everything is well with you & Myla. Did you know that Guy salvaged, if=that's the 
appropriate word, the Monitor - I think that was around Beaufor= too. 
I told you I had a question for =yla. I'm going to UK to sort out my mother, what she wants to do. She does='t want 
to go to a care home so her choices are sell her house & buy a=retirement flat or stay where she is & get a reverse 
mortgage. At the moment she has visits from a commercial care company & has a private p=rsonal assistant for 3 hrs x 6 
days a week & a personal trainer twice = week. It's all a bit unwieldy. She's 91, about 6 mths ago she became quit= weak 
& couldn't manage to stand. No one is quite sure why, kind of working on that. I have got & am gett=ng specialized 
equipment that can be used to help her stand & transfer=from chair to mobile chair to bed etc by one person. My 
thought is if she =ets a retirement flat for her to have someone live with her & take care of things during the day/part of 
the day & her have the=commercial care company visits for getting up/going to bed. 
I wanted to ask Myla if she knew=anyone back home who might have experience in caring for elderly people &a=p; 
might be interested in doing this. My cousins Thai wife was going to do=this but it is all but impossible for a Thai national 
to get a visa that would allow her to work, she is happy to do it without the visa but I am w=rried in case she gets in 
trouble & if messes up her ever getting even=ually to actually live in uk with my cousin (he doesn't make enough money 
=or her to be allowed to live with him in uk!). Apparently it is much much easier for a Philippines national to g=t a visa.. I 
want to try & find someone who is a friend of a friend so=to speak rather than find a complete stranger so I thought I'd 
ask Myla vi= you to see if this was a possibility. 
I guess you must be close to goi=g to NZ in the depth of winter!! It's been high 90's here for days, =ust had the 
usual thunderstorms with a bit of hail for good measure. 
&nb=p; 
=nbsp; 
all the very best to you both, &n=sp; Laura,
