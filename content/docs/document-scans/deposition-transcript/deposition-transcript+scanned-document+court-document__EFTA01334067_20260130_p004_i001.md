CONTROVERSY flared at the Radar launch party when Gawker founder Nick Denton was hit with a creamy 
gooey pie as he sidled up next to magazine founder Maer Roshan for a photo op. 
Gawker, a media-centric Web site which for weeks has had been needling Radar and its self promoting founder, 
sarcastically calling it, "Radar, the Greatest American Magazine Launch." 
The photo op was seen as a chance to make nice between Roshan and Denton to prove they were willing to let 
bygones be bygones, blah, blah. 
Then the peace accord was ruptured as a burly unknown person broke through the throng and smashed the 
custard pie squarely into the face of Denton and dashed out. leaving no clue as to his identity. He was wearing 
an English-soccer style shirt and a New York Knicks hat. 
Denton, his face and clothes a mess from the ambush. assumed he had been set up by Roshan. (In an early 
version of the event that he posted on his own Web site, he insisted he had only been hit with a glancing blow 
from the pie tosser, but had to retract that version when photos turned up). 
Denton then promptly dumped his glass of red wine on Roshan's head. Roshan professed to be as surprised as 
anyone (and in fact was one of several bystanders hit with splatter from the Unknown Pie Guy). They later 
retreated to Roshan's hotel suite, Roshan changed clothes and even let Denton shower. 
He also rummaged around and found a T-shirt and pants for Denton to wear for the rest of the night. 
Denton, despite the good turn done by Roshan still feels it was a set-up by event planner Nadine Johnson. 
"It is pretty clear it was one of Nadine Johnson's hires," said Denton. "It was nicely staged, but the execution left 
a lot to be desired since Maer was hit too." 
"Weal baffles me is why they would want their launch event hijacked by that kind of publicity, " asked Denton "I 
heard Mort Zuckerman slipped in the goo," said Denton. 
"He had to have the whole thing explained to him, including what a blog is." 
Daily Snooze owner Zuckerman and billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein were both on hand, but were out of
