» I think I have some idea how to extend this toy model towards =scillators with variable speed and more than two 
dimensions. It may =lso possible to show that there are reasons why stable traveling =scillators can exist in id, 2d and 3d 
but not in 4d, for similar =easons why stable planetary orbits only work in 3d. 
> To give a brief intution about a traveling oscillator as a wavelet: =hink of a wavelet as two concentric circles, one 
representing the =eviation above zero, the other one the deviation below zero. They try =o equalize, but because the 
catch up is not immediately, they just =witch their value instead. (This is the discretized simplification.) =ow displace the 
inner circle with respect to the outer one: the =rrangement starts to travel. Making the pattern stable requires =istorting 
the circles, and probably relaxing the discretization by =ncreasing the resolution. The frequency of the wavelet 
oscillation is =nversely related to how fast it can travel. 
> You can also think of a wavelet as a vortex in a traveling liquid. 
» =he vortex is entirely generated by the molecular dynamics within 
> the =iquid (which are our discrete lattice computations), and it 
» does not =issolve because it is a stable oscillator. The vortex can 
> travel =erpendicular to the direction of the fluid, which is 
> equivalent to =raveling in space. It cannot go arbitrarily fast: the 
> progression of =he liquid defines a lightcone in which each molecule 
> can influence =ther molecules, and which limits the travel of every 
> possible vortex. =lso, the faster the vortex moves sideways, the 
> slower it must =scillate, because the both translation and state

» (The contraction of a vortex =s equivalent to giving it a momentum.) 
> An observer will always have to be implemented as a stable system =apable of state change, i.e. as a system of 
vortices that interact in =uch a way that they form a multistable oscillator that can travel in =nison. From the perspective 
of the observer, time is observed rate of =tate change in its environment, and it depends on its own rate of =hange, 
which in turn depends on the speed of the observer. This gives =ise to relativistic time. Also, the observer does not 
perceive itself =s being distorted, but it will normalize itself, and instead perceive =ts environment around itself as being 
distorted. As a result, the =bserver will always have the impression to travel exactly in the middle =f its light cone. This 
model seems to recover Lorentz invariance, but =ith a slight catch: it seems to me that while speed of light is =onstant 
and there is no preferred frame of reference wrt acceleration, =he resolution of the universe changes with the speed of 
the observer. =o idea if this is a bug or a feature, or if it will be neutralized by =omething I cannot see yet before I have a 
proper simulation. 
> Obviously, all of the above is just a conjecture. I can make a =onvincing looking animation, and I am confident that 
many features like =imultaneity etc. will work out, but I don't yet know if a proper =umeric simulation will indeed work 
as neatly as I imagine.
