Dear Ms. Saadiq: 
My name is Adam Waldman, and I am Prof=ssor Lawrence Krauss' litigation counsel. Earlier this week,=I 
sent the attached letter to Buzzfeed via one of their reporters named Pe=er Aldhous. 
I am also in =eceipt of Mr. Aldhous' letter to ASU, which is a variation on defa=ation — both libel and 
slander — that Mr. Aldhous and his =olleagues have been manufacturing for at least 6 months (notably without a=y 
reporting) in a campaign with a purpose known only to them. Buzzfe=d's first method is to call or write third parties, 
posit a list o= fake, anonymous, recklessly false and malicious "allegations,Q=8040 and ask if the third party has 
anything to add. Buzzfeed.=99s second method is to seek tortious interference with Professor Krauss=E24* 
professional contracts, by writing third parties with whom Profes=or Krauss is in privity, present a similarly inflammatory 
series of anonym=us, recklessly false and malicious accusations, and then question: how can=the email's recipient allow 
such a person to serve on their board,=or speak at their conference? The letter from Buzzfeed to the Univer=ity falls 
into both categories. There will be appropriate legal consequenc=s for Buzzfeed's actions. 
It is my understanding that your office believes it is compelled by t=e above to investigate false, 
defamatory, anonymous accusations posited by=the online tabloid Buzzfeed by contacting third parties and potentially 
re=roadcasting the tabloid Buzzfeed's accusations. To be clear,=these accusations were not made to the University by 
actual human beings w=o are alleging they were victims. There is no evidence they were pre=ented to Buzzfeed by 
actual human beings. Moreover, no present or former e=ployees of ASU have made any such allegations to your office, 
or to any of=ice at ASU, to our knowledge. They are simply alleged by a tabloid, and on= that had yet published a "story" 
on the topic when they forw=rded these to you. You may propose to rebroadcast this tabloid's=libel to other third 
parties who have also made no accusation against Prof=ssor Krauss. I suggest that you consult with the University'= 
counsel before taking so rash a step as re-broadcasting hearsay defamatio= that came to you via an online tabloid under 
these circumstances.<=> 
Professor Krauss and I both recognize the =bsolute need to investigate real allegations. Some of the 
women who =ave bravely come forward with personal harassment allegations against Harv=y Weinstein are my clients 
and friends. Some of these victims have b=en advised by me. Those actual allegations are entirely distinct fro= a tabloid 
attempting to manufacture allegations to create harm. 
Sincerely, 
Adam Waldman =C24,
