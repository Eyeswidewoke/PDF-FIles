as a prosecutor, including serving as the Chief District Prosecutor in Stockholm and later as Director for the 
Regional Prosecution Authority in Stockholm. Since 2008 he has seen himself primarily as a social commentator 
on legal matters. He was concerned that the proper procedures had not been followed in Mr Assange's case in 
Sweden. The prosecution should not have confirmed to the media that Mr Mange was considered a likely 
suspect of rape. That disclosure was unlawful. He was surprised that this defendant had not been detained in 
custody pending the investigation into the rape allegation. In his view good prosecution practice requires a very 
early interview with the suspect. It is an imperative for the accused to have the opportunity to respond to the 
accusations at the earliest possible time when he still remembers the intimate details. Thus it was quite wrong, in 
his view, for the prosecutor Ms Ny to decline the opportunity to interview Mr Assange. He believed that to 
issue the European Arrest Warrant without having first tried to arrange an interrogation in England at the 
earliest possible time via a request for Mutual Assistance offended against the principle of proportionality. A 
prosecutor should not seek to arrest and extradite Mr Assange simply for the purposes of questioning as long as 
other means have not been tried, or have been tried and failed. The defendant is not accused: he is a suspect. 
He has not been indicted. He was taken to section 18 of the Swedish Appeal Code (page 58). The golden rule is 
that a party should be heard. Until then he should not be prosecuted. The last thing that happens in a 
preliminary investigation is that the suspect has the right to see all material and the opportunity to comment. 
He said that rape trials in Sweden are normally heard privately. He believes it is necessary to balance the integrity 
of the injured party against the principle of openness. Both parties might think it is a good thing that the whole 
trial is heard behind closed doors. 
In cross-examination he said his understanding of the steps taken to interview Mr Assange comes from what he 
was told by Mr Hurtig, the Swedish defence lawyer, and what he has read. [In his proof Mr Alhem said that 
"according to the information given to me, Prosecutor Ny declined the opportunity to interview Mr Assange 
after she took over the case on IR September, despite the fact he remained in Sweden until 27th September 2010 
... I understand that the prosecutor declined the offer to meet for an interview simply because the police officer 
at the time was sick ... it is catastrophic that so much time has passed without a very detailed interrogation 
having taken place.") He had not read the documentation put before the Stockholm District Court and the 
Court of Appeal. He had not seen the statements of Mr Hurtig or Ms Ny. The account given by Ms Ny as to 
the factual steps taken to interview Mr Assange were put to him. "I make no judgement between Mr Hurtig and 
Ms Ny." He added that he saw his role as giving a judgement on the ECHR, the legal issues and fairness. There 
is nothing wrong with the EAW issued for Mr Assange. If it was the case that it was not possible to hold the 
interrogation hearing with the suspect earlier then he too, when he was a prosecutor, would have issued the 
EAW. However he would have first tried to arrange the interrogation hearing in another way. He agreed that 
the evidential question as to the steps taken to interview Mr Assange is relevant and that he should have seen the 
relevant documentation before expressing his view. I Iowever even if Ms Ny's account, which he heard in court 
today for the first time, is correct then that does not change his view that an interrogation should have taken 
place in England. He made it clear that the statement of Ms Ny does not correspond with the information he 
had been given by Mr Hurtig. Ms Ny "is allowed to seek an EAW — there is no doubt about that". On the
