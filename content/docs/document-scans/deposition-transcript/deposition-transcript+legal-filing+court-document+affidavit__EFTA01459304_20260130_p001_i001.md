conjunction with the entire Account Agreement). Please call your Client Advisor with any questions or concerns 
regarding the use of margin. 
When you purchase securities, you may pay for the securities in full or you may borrow pan of the purchase price from

based on the value of fully paid securities held in the Account. If you choose to borrow funds from DBSI, you must open 
a margin account and sign the attached Margin Agreement along with the Account Agreement. If the securities in your 
account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result. DBSI can take action, 
such as issuing a margin call and/or selling securities or other assets in any of your accounts las provided in the Margin

assets in any of your accounts held at DBSI to cover the margin deficiency. You also will be responsible for any 
shortfall in the account after such a sale, including costs and interest accrued. 
3. NISI can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. Some investors mistakenly believe that a 
firm must contact them for a margin call to be valid, and that the firm cannot liquidate securities or other assets in 
their accounts to meet the call unless the firm has contacted them first. This is not the case. Generally, DBSI does 
attempt to notify its Clients of margin calls, but it is not required to do so. However, even if DBSI has contacted a 
Client and provided a specific date by which the Client can meet a margin call. DB51 can still take necessary steps to 
protect its financial interests, including immediately selling the securities without notice to the Client. 
4. You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a

sell in order to protect its interests.

advance written notice. These changes in firm policy often take effect immediately and may result in the issuance 
of a maintenance margin call. Your failure to satisfy the call may cause DBSI to liquidate or sell securities in 
your account(s).
