Jeffrey Epstein 
> 
Hello Jeffrey! 
Firstly, about jail. As you are the person with whom I should be honest, that's for 
I was at 
with 
and both of us took some clothes from the men's department and went to the women's fitting rooms to put them in the 
bag. One friend said us that this place is the most easy to take something, a long time ago. I never used to do that but 
when I recognized that I need to go home and even have nothing for my dad, brother and boyfriend I made this stupid 
thing first and last time in my life. So they put us in jail but 
vas out in the night and I moved to the prison, it was 
awful, I was sitting with 24 sick Afro-Americans till the evening of next day. I can't believe how it was for you. Then I had 
my court and my lawyer said that I can go to it when I will come back to it. Freedom is the most expensive that we have. 
Sorry for that news, I didn't expect that from myself either. 
As about going home. - I DON'T KNOW! 
I don't know Jeffrey; I'm going crazy; I am really ready to lose my head. I want to tell you everything and know how you 
think about that, because nowadays you are the only person who can tell me what is better, thinking of me, and this will 
be the most clever answer. 
I have my ticket on 11th , I called my mom, she picked up the phone at this time but is not talking with me. I just said the 
date when I come for her to know. I was happy to hear something different from "do whatever you want, as usual. If you 
come back live in you' 
owever you want and we just don't care". That's because parents are too angry on me, 
I made so many mistakes and the main thing that hurts is that my dad is even not talking with mom because of me. And 
it is very difficult to know that my dear mother is all alone and mad about everything. That's why I want to go back 
home, I didn't see them from June and want to say sorry to them and make my parents live together. 
Concerning my study, it is really good university. Despite the fact that it is i 
n li h 
r 
n 
tem and 
all m lessons are in English and in similar program. It is kind of franchise university 
I like it very much and I really want to study there. Maybe I will transfer to US university in the 
u ure u 
on wan to lose the year because I'm here. I should go home and finish the year for it. Despite the fact 
that I have nothing to pay for it, but I hope to be good with parents. 
Jeffrey but I have a lot of money that I owe to people. I know that this is stupid; I'm a lazy fuck as you usually say, but I 
really can't leave this country until I will deal with them, and moreover I owe to 
nd that is the most awful thing 
ever, because she paid for me from January for everything. I hoped to have my Jo in the end of January as a model, 
very good, but they didn't like my hair. Now she is on her way to home and every time says me "I can't go home because 
I need my money" and I understand her. I just the day before yesterday counted everything that I need to do and to 
resolve and understood that this is a huge amount of money, but there is no other choice. I can't go home without it. I 
really can't. I need to give y credit at chase which I from September I need to give 
her money, and to my 2 more 
friends also, I need to pay for my study, buy suitcases, pay for overweight, buy something home, minimum, pay for my 
study, put braces, live the first time in dormitory, because I will have my work from March at 
They took me and I can feed myself, so, this is impossible. I should wait and stay here to ave some work, and 
solve the problems. I can't go home like that in addition to that my parents are really mad on me. 
BUT. I thought about not going home, but I can't stay here. My visa expires on 16th,Ms finally going home, I'm alone. 
Nowhere to live, nothing to do. You understand that it is impossible. And moreover I should call my parents and tell 
them I was studying in the university for 
and now I even will not end my year, having nothing, I will stay in US 
without visa and do nothing, nowhere and with nobody. 
I don't know Jeffrey what is better. I m really tired. I even don't know how I could get in such situation. Oh I know, but 
then I think about how stupid I am to do that. Today is 8th, my flight is on 11th 
I am sorry for writing such a big mess 
but I wanted to tell this to somebody. You are the only who can tell me the right things, I see you are my friend and wish 
all the best for me.
