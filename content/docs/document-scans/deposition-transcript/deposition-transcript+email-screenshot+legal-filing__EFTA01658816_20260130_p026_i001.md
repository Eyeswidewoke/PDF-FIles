Fauci Concerned Misinformation Will Hobble Vaccination Effort. 
CNBC (11/19, Higgins-Dunn, 3.62M) reports on its website that on Thursday, NIAID Director 
Fauci "said...that convincing people who consider the coronavirus to be 'fake news' to get 
vaccinated against the disease could become an issue as the nation seeks to achieve so-called 
herd immunity to suppress the pandemic. 'They actually don't think that this is a problem,' 
Fauci said during a conversation with The Hastings Center." 
Carson Says He Is Taking Oleander Extract As COVID Treatment. 
In an interview with the Washington Post (11/19, Terris, 14.2M), HUD Secretary Carson said he 
is taking oleander extract as a treatment for COVID after hearing about it from MyPillow 
inventor Mike Lindell. Carson said, "I heard about the oleander extract from Mike." Carson "said 
he took the extract, which has not been approved for such purposes by the FDA and which 
experts say may be dangerous, and within hours his symptoms disappeared - to the delight of 
Lindell, who has a financial stake in the company that makes the extract." 
Trump Administration Facing Multiple Challenges Over Vaccine Distribution. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/19, story 4, 1:50, Holt, 5.84M) reported that the Trump Administration 
is facing a series of vaccine challenges going into December, and they include FDA approval and 
nationwide distribution. FDA Commissioner Hahn promised earlier on Thursday that the FDA 
would not "cut corners" on the Pfizer and Moderna emergency applications for their COVID 
vaccines. Hahn said in a statement, "I am promising you, your viewers, and the American 
people [that] we will not cut corners when it comes to our ultimate assessment of these 
vaccines." Operation Warp Speed COO General Perna said in a separate news conference, "We 
will begin distribution of the vaccine within 24 hours after emergency use authorization is 
approved." 
In an appearance on Fox News' The Story, Assistant HHS Secretary for Health Adm. Brett 
Giroir was asked to respond to Joe Biden's comments regarding distribution of vaccines. Giroir 
said, "Comparing testing to vaccination doesn't make any scientific sense. Operation Warp 
Speed has - it's incredible. We have two vaccines that are 95% efficacious, that are safe, and 
that appeared to work in elderly - we are going to have tens of millions of doses by the end of 
the year and the distribution process is sound. ... It's timed not to the hour, but to the minute." 
National Academies Publishes Plan For Vaccine Distribution. USA Today (11/19, 
Weise, 10.31M) reports that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
"has outlined a plan for fair distribution that's being used as a framework by the Centers for 
Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices," and the CDC will "make the 
final decision on when certain groups of Americans will have access to vaccine." The initial 
vaccination group "includes frontline health care workers, first responders, cleaners and 
ambulance drivers," but full vaccination "could take up to a year." 
The Los Angeles Times (11/19, Levey, 4.64M) reports that regular Americans "shouldn't 
expect to get a vaccine at their doctor's office or pharmacy for many months." Council on 
Foreign Relations Global Heath Program Director Thomas J. Bollyky said of the distribution 
risks, "If we are going to reach the levels of vaccination that we need to control the pandemic, 
which will be challenging, we have to sustain the public's confidence." He added, "If we don't 
have a fair allocation of vaccines, that could undermine the whole campaign in a way that 
would do lasting damage." 
Oxford, AstraZeneca Laud Early Vaccine Results. On ABC World News TonightVi 
(11/19, story 2, 0:35, Muir, 7.26M), Whit Johnson reported, "Oxford and AstraZeneca say new 
results show their vaccine is safe, and produce robust immune responses in healthy adults and 
people over the age of 70." The final result data is not yet released, and it joins other positive 
vaccine test data from Pfizer and Moderna.
