News from the NBAA 2004 Convention 
SSBJ Unveiled Today at NBAA Convention 
Reno-based Aerion today at NBAA unveiled a 10-passenger. Mach 1.6 twinjet that it said could enter service by 
2011. pushing aside assumptions by established business aircraft manufacturers that its not yet economically and 
technically feasible to launch a supersonic business jet (SSBJ). The company, led by business aviation veteran Brian 
Barents. believes the key elements to making the project a success are its efficient wing design and its powerplant selection—
a pair of Pratt & Whitney JTSD-219 engines, which currently power one-third of the world's airliners. Aerion is engaged in 
advanced development and has completed flight testing of a supersonic natural laminar flow (NLF) wing section (four 
years ago aboard a NASA jet fighter). Leading the startup company's venture group funding development is billionaire 
Robert Bass. Dr. Richard Tracy. Aerion's chief technology officer, is an aerodynamicist whose extensive research on 
supersonic NLF led to the present wing concept that he patented in 1994. The airplane will be fuel efficient at cruise 
speeds just below the speed of sound, according to Aerion, allowing it to perform short- and long-haul overland missions 
with the same economies as today's large business jets. A maximum range of 4,000 nm is roughly the same at both 
subsonic and supersonic speeds. Because of these attributes. the Aerion project won't hinge on whether the FAA can be 
persuaded to change FAR 91.187, which now prevents supersonic flight over the continental U.S. Over the next year and a 
half the company will have discussions with major airframe manufacturers and first-tier suppliers to establish risk-sharing 
partnerships for the 90,000-pound-mtow airplane. Estimated price is under $80 million. Tomorrow, another startup 
company is scheduled to reveal its SSBJ program. 
Delivery Forecast Sees Blues Skies Ahead 
Honeywell Aerospace's 13th annual business aviation outlook released yesterday projects increasing demand for new 
business jets, with customers expecting to purchase more than 8,300 jets valued at more than $131 billion from 2004 
through 2014. Improved order rates, established new model backlogs, continuing expansion in fractional ownership in 
North America and Europe and sustained economic recovery are key factors supporting a longer-term outlook for growth, 
said Honeywell. After a record peak in 2001 when business jet manufacturers shipped 750 aircraft, deliveries declined 
more than 30 percent over the next two years and reached a low of 506 last year. First-half deliveries of 238 turbofan 
aircraft this year represented a 2.6-percent increase over levels recorded in the first half of last year. Honeywell expects 
operators to take delivery of approximately 525 to 550 new traditional business jets this year, compared with 506 a year 
ago. and increasing to more than 650 in 2005. Deliveries in 2006 are expected to be in the range of 650 to 700 jets. A look 
back on how the annual Honeywell business jet outlooks correlate actual delivery numbers indicates a remarkable level of 
accuracy—within about plus or minus 2 percent over the history of the survey. 
Learjet 40XR to Enter Service in 2006 
Bombardier announced today at NBAA the Learjet 40XR, an enhanced performance version of the Model 40 that is 
scheduled to enter service in 2006. The new version of the Learjet 40 series will have improved hot-and-high performance, 
faster time-to-climb speeds and reduced flight time en-route. For example. according to Bombardier, taking off from 
Jackson Hole, Wyo., at 28 degrees C, carrying six passengers and with full fuel, the Learjet 40XR will be able to fly an 
additional 936 nm compared with the Learjet 40. The new aircraft will also require just 23 minutes to reach FL430 after 
takeoff from a hot and high airfield, the company said. These improvements will be enabled by powering the Learjet 40XR 
with the TFE731-20-BR, the same turbofan that has been in service on the Learjet 45XR light business jet since Junc. 
Bombardier said the Learjet 40XR will cost $400,000 more than a comparably equipped Learjet 40, which will remain in 
production. Meanwhile, Bombardier reported that the Learjet 45 family has demonstrated its ability to perform the steep 
descent angle required for approval to fly into London City Airport. The London City approval came as Bombardier 
delivered its 250th 1.earjet 45. 
Higher-performance Avanti H in Flight Test 
Piaggio Aero Industries will introduce next year a higher-performance version of its Avanti twin-turboprop pusher. 
The $5.97 million Avanti 11 will offer enhanced avionics, speed, payload and cabin comfort over the current model, which 
it will supercede. The cockpit will include the Rockwell Collins Pro Line 21 avionics suite featuring three 8- by 10-inch
