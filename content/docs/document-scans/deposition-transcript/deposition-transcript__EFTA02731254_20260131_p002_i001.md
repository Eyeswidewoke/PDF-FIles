May 15, 2012 
I am going to make the goal of writing at least twice a week, maybe more but I always say that 
and never do. But since its for trauma no one has to see it. 
At the end of my stay, I'm going to have all of the staff sign this book the right way up with the 
person I'm most able to talk to be the first. 
At first when I heard it was approved I thought Id be mil to Arizona but when they said 
was best fit because I'm able to work with 
I wanted to scream and 
cry because I haven't been back to Florida since my last time with Ghislaine and Jeffrad so 
that was so scary and I didn't want to have a man therapist even if he does know about
I 
won't be able to talk to him even though it turns out that he is super nice and understands me. 
The flight wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I felt wei 
other people since I was always on private planes but I think I I 
The flight attendant, I wish I got her name, she could tell 
to the pilot and I kept looking to make sure it wasn't one o 
ey' 
but it wasn't. During the flight she would make sure 
and drinks and when I got really scared as we 
with me. I started getting really scared once 14 
wese
terrified that maybe this was a set-up and whi I
tit t off 
Ghislaine but the flight attendant didn't 
and then helped me to find the driver 
The drive was super scary. The 
so many people drive BLAC 
And he was nice but it 
internal panic as I wa 
right to Jeffrey's h 
gross, disgusting pi 
ansi 
the roads felt the same beca 
e on a plane with so many 
better. More safe. 
sa„,fh
rst she introduced me 
is at could be co-pilot 
Notairokay3 pt giving me free snacks 
tl!t 
e looked at fun magazines 
beca se had to meet a driver and I was 
plane I'd see Mr. Juan or maybe even 
e. he walked with me to get my things 
sure he knew where he was taking me. 
e car was too much like Ghislaine's. Why do 
th windows that seem so dark. 
as trying to stop the memories and I started to have 
w dows because it looks so much like we were heading 
ed to think I'd been set up and we'd soon see his stupid, 
any time and I don't know if I am even that close to there but 
verything is so flat here. 
I couldn't manage because I was becoming more and more convinced he was kidnapping me and 
I would have to face Jeffrey against after leaving how I did so all I could make out was "yes" "no" 
"thank you" and some "uh huhs" so he probably thinks I'm so rude. It ended up being fine but it 
was super hard to keep it together. The campus is beautiful but the ool reminds me too much of 
bad things so I won't be going to that. It has changed a lot since 
so maybe they got money from that to make it so pretty. 
And. is really nice but I still wish I could have gotten a girl therapist because I know I won't 
be able to talk about any of this trauma. I don't like to go to the groups outside of the healing 
garden or the other building because I get so much panic that I think Jeffrey or Ghislaine will just 
pop up.
