of 2018 for next year's products but it would be a natural progression for Apple to shift further away from Dialog. There 
is also is a shift towards sub-PM IC 2019 on smartphones which has begun on the architecture of high end devices. Sub 
PMICs are required to effectively efficiently lay power blocks on a design closer to the functional blocks of a newer 
generation smartphone board (audio package, sensor hubs etc.) but their ASP can as little as 1/10th the ASP of a core 
PMIC. Even if Dialog was able to get a larger piece of the sub PMIC stack, it wouldn't offset main PMIC share loss (main 
PMICs ASPs are $3-$4, sub-PMIC ASPs are $0.20-$0.50. 
If this had occurred three years ago it would be likely that the current largest shareholder could be seen as a 
potential white knight or interested acquirer. After all, it happens to be Tsinghua Unigroup, the China state backed 
Goliath which is leading the charge to create a semiconductor powerhouse in China. But that is unrealistic today and 
would never get past CFIUS. There is valuation support given Dialog has $480M net cash and a lowly valuation. But if 
there is a path to Dialog losing say half of the current revenue base over the next two years then it is difficult to 
ascertain the floor with so much uncertainty. Taking a midpoint of this wide range would imply a risk of 30% to current 
consensus revenue estimates for 2019. Standing still on current (already very low) valuation metrics would imply fair 
value/floor at around €13/share. 
The bigger question here is that Apple needs to control more of the key technology building blocks for 
sophisticated designs and seeks to find ways to prevent the BOM (Bill of Materials) of the iPhone from spiking higher. 
Companies such as Dialog (7x P/E) and Cirrus Logic (12x P/E) have valuations that reflect such a risk with heavy reliance 
on Apple as a customer. Newer technologies (3D sensing, ToF) may not have the same short term risk, but ultimately the 
valuations will likely fade as the technologies become more mainstream, competitive advantages of leaders get lessened 
and Apple exerts pricing power. AMS trades on 30x 2018 P/E (with downside risk to the "E") and the huge ramp of 
volumes, design wins and market share dominance which many expect through the next two to three years may not 
transpire. 
eSports: Livestreaming explodes 
Live streamers in the U.S. on sites like Twitch (Amazon owned) are almost as influential as journalists when it 
comes to influencing purchasing intent (15% vs 16%). PayPal survey shows that 34% of livestream viewers in the U.S. 
have spent more than $50 on livestream content in the last three months (which amounts to more than a Netflix 
subscription and is similar to what is spent on a full game ($53.56). This is before we even get the new Fortnite eSports 
competition which will see $100M in prize money, 4x the size of any eSport before. By comparison the current French 
Open Tennis Grand Slam has a total prize pool of E39M.

Trade Wars and China IP curve 
Reuters report that the U.S. plan to push ahead with plans to apply a 25% tariff on $50B of Chinese goods by 
15th June, as well as an announcement of investment restrictions and enhanced export controls for Chinese persons and 
entities that "related to the acquisition of industrially significant technology" by the end of June. It echoes the 
emergency CFIUS policies considered earlier this year and goes back to the core of the battle over IP. China State press 
this morning warn that a full-scale trade war would be inevitable if the tariffs proceed. The move would also mean that 
any previous agreements reached by both sides would be rendered invalid and China would then respond with similar 
punitive measures. China doesn't want a trade war, but it seems that it is willing to go into battle and fight if required. 
Perhaps all this uncertainty explains why Apple has been stockpiling component inventory? After all the same measure 
grew 170% YoY last quarter and Apple, as the most global of corporations, would be at risk of supply chain shocks. 
Meanwhile this week it was reported this week that after three years the province in Hefei has successfully built 
out one of the fastest growing IC clusters in China; a total of 129 IC companies across foundries, fabless firms and back 
end companies have set up and created a complete local supply chain. The output value of the Hefei IC industry grew 
31% in 2017, and remember this is before the significant tax breaks for the semiconductor industry in China were 
announced earlier this year.
