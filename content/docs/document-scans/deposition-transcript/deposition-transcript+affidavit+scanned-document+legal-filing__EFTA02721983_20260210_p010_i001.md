perspective throughout but the truth is that we had to learn how to respond to Pearl Harbor, the 
Nazis, the Cold War etc. The same applies here. Our press promotes "elites" who are tasked with 
acting as if they possess the "true wisdom" to deal with our threats but the truth is we do not 
know nor are we equipped to marshal enough of our population to agree just yet. The sooner we 
learn, however, the less we will suffer. Mirroring has always been a key component of those 
lessons. 
I have been encouraged by some recent acts that have begu n to nip at the asymmetry. For years, 
the language of "feeling s" had been reserved for our enemy while we were limited to that of 
"action;" we would do terrible acts that would cause bad feelings in the enemy which would then 
serve to justify whatever response it made. It had always been a question of the harsh insensitive 
NIA Westerners do against Muslims and the resulting ham, i, 
shame etc. that Muslims 
experience. The Ground Zero Mosque incident, however, broke new ground because all of a 
sudden non-Muslims' feelings became the focus and were cast as resulting from Muslim acts. 
Another example was seen in how quickly the attempt to blame the Benghazi murders on 
the video about Mohammad fell apart. Just as large corporations eventually learned to turn away 
from shakedown attempts from race baiters, we are beginning to learn to demand symmetry 
through mirroring. A word of caution: When enablers change their behavior and demand 
symmetrical rules for the addict, the latter typically initially erupts with great resistance. This is a 
stage we must be prepared to tolerate and fully withstand as it creates the only real chance for the 
addict to finally change. It is critical, therefore, that when we finally engage in mirroring that we 
be prepared to see it through completion. 
FP: What if we fail to engage in our own Inner Jihad and the Control Factor stays firmly in place? 
Siegel: Critical to the Inner Jihad is the realization that our civilization is fragile; not to be taken 
for granted. Our demands for multi-culturalism and diversity have bumped heads with the simple 
paradox that tolerating the intolerant leads to extinction. Tolerating the intolerant is perhaps the 
most crystalline version of asymmetry we have accepted. Seriously engaged Muslims MUST 
place the Koran above all law while in America, the Constitution ranks supreme. As Omar Ahmad 
, founder of CAIR, reputedly said, "Islam isn't in Amer ica to be equal to any other faith, but to 
become dominant. The Koran is the highest authority in America and Islam is the only accepted 
religion on Earth." Who makes law- the people or Allah? While the Control Factor constantly 
seeks for some accommodation between the two, this conflict CAN NOT be negotiated. Only one 
can survive not because we have declared "war" but because our Islamic Enemy has. That is, 
perhaps, the lesson we will most need to fully learn, one way or another. We will eventually hit a 
Turnaround Moment as a nation and if enough of us are not truly prepared to fight and continue 
to be controlled by our delusions, we will lose. If we truly seek to win, it is better to get there 
sooner while we have advantages than later.
