ARTICLE IX 
REDEMPTION 
Section 9.1. 
Optional Redemption; Election to Redeem. 
(a) 
At the direction of the Required Redemption Percentage to the Issuer (with a copy 
to the Trustee), the Rated Notes shall be redeemable at their respective Redemption Prices from 
Sale Proceeds (and the net proceeds of the Pledged Collateral Obligations and Equity Securities 
representing accrued interest) and any other funds in the Collection Account and the Payment 
Account (including any proceeds from a Redemption Financing) (i) on any Distribution Date 
after the last day of the Non-Call Period; or (ii) on any Distribution Date during or after the end 
of the Non-Call Period, upon and during the continuance of a Tax Event. 
The redemption direction may specify a redemption of one or more specified Classes of 
Rated Notes (in whole but not in part) with Refinancing Proceeds (each, a "Refinancing") or, if a 
Refinancing is not specified, the Issuer will redeem each Class of Rated Notes (in whole but not 
in part) (a "Rated Notes Redemption"). On any Distribution Date on or after the Rated Notes 
have been redeemed or paid in full, the Subordinated Securities (in whole but not in part) will be 
redeemed (an "Equity Redemption") at the direction of a Majority of the Subordinated Securities 
to the Issuer (with a copy to the Trustee). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall 
continue to hold funds on deposit in the Credit Facility Reserve Account to the extent required to 
meet the Issuer's future obligations with respect to the Unfunded Amount of any Credit Facility 
and any Hedge Agreement in effect on the date of the Issuer Order directing the Optional 
Redemption may not be terminated until the later of (i) the fifth Business Day prior to the 
Redemption Date and (ii) the last date on which an Optional Redemption may be cancelled under 
Section 9.2(d). 
If the Subordinated Securities are not being redeemed on the Redemption Date for the 
Rated Notes, the Investment Manager shall direct the liquidation of only that portion of the 
Collateral as may be necessary to provide sufficient funds, together with other available funds, to 
redeem the Rated Notes. 
(b) 
To effect a Rated Notes Redemption, the Investment Manager will direct 
disposition of Collateral to extent necessary to fund such redemption; provided that the 
Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer), with the consent of a Majority of the Subordinated 
Securities, may, in lieu of directing the disposition of all or a portion of the Collateral, obtain a 
loan, credit or similar facility from one or more financial institutions or purchasers (collectively, 
"Redemption Financing"). The Issuer will provide notice to each Rating Agency at least 
10 Business Days prior to the execution of Redemption Financing and shall enter into a 
supplemental indenture pursuant to Article VIII to facilitate Redemption Financing (including, 
without limitation, to Grant a security interest to the Redemption Financing lender). 
No Rated Notes Redemption may occur unless the Investment Manager certifies to the 
Trustee that: 
(i) 
at least seven Business Days prior to the applicable Redemption Date, the 
Investment Manager shall have furnished to the Trustee (with a copy to any Hedge
