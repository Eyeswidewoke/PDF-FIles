Re: will call Monday 
I will call you in the morning. I am in Southampton. We had two events this weekend. Saturday and Sunday. The driver is 
coming at 10:00am. I am packing. Can I call you at 10:10am? Nothing surprises me. 
I do think there is a hugh difference to me personally between 1.1 million and 1.6 million. Phil was going to ask for the 
500,000 and settle for half...which did not thrill me. He says Gary's lawyers are ignoring him and not acknowledging Gary 
is in trouble. They will have to deal in Sept when they approach us to wrap up the estate. 
Remember my father's trust for Gary and me was 1.4 million and my mother left 300,000 in it...taking the money out 
illegally with out my brother's written approval. 
This is what Phil has been saying all along- Gary broke the law and would lose a court case... But we are not going to 
court...not worth it. 
Last Thursday, Aug. 9th Bryan called me from NYC. I was sitting in the London airport and he was screaming at me over 
the phone. I said I am sitting in the London airport and can not talk. He said, "I know exactly where you are. I put you 
there.". He ranted on that I am hated by everyone and contribute nothing to the business and Darin brings in all the 
sponsorship...and handles 90% of the business. He told me I was as bad as his nasty lazy ex-boyfriend who is suing him 
for his share of the Hampton house. I was shaking when I hung up and did not know where that tirade came from...must 
have been after Glenn Davis went to visit his book keeper. 
Byran runs his life from an apartment and never interfaces in person with people. He relies on voices on the phone 
telling him what's going on. He is now flying from Manila to Dubai and back for air miles to "give out" to everyone....) 
think that is his rationalization for stealing...by "taking care" of everyone's air travel. So creepy. 
Have some ideas. Peg
