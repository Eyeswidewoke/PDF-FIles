Privacy: China has a big opportunity as users there are much more willing to trade their personal 
data for product benefits than U.S. users, and China is claiming more spots on the top 20 internet

Europe v U.S. Equities 
At the index level there remains a value disconnect between the US and Europe. The charts below show 
that while Europe trades at one Standard Deviation below its trend PIE (on 11.5x) the US trades at nearly 
a one Standard Deviation premium (on 19.8x). This led our Strategy team, through their monthly 
'Compass Points Product" (let us know if you'd like a copy) to focus on the best and worst combinations 
of value creation, valuation premiums and relative earnings momentum in Europe. A full detailed 
analysis of the same is available from our team, just let us know if you want it. Within the TMT arena we 
would highlight two stocks, one good and one bad. Logitech (Buy, eGaming basket) has great relative 
earnings momentum which remains top quartile and the stock has nearly "all blue bar champion" status. 
Daniel also highlights that the Value Track screen still highlights 50% three year upside and the Value 
Layers displays continued widening of EVA margins. (For any discussions of these methodologies or 
screens do get in touch with Daniel White 
(Daniel.white@mirabaud.co.uk<mailto:Danietwhite©mirabaud.co.uk> ) for more on this. In contrast to 
Logitech comes Swisscom. Swisscom revisions remain worst in class, and the Trend PE valuation offers 
some 8% 3Y downside. Swisscom and other bond-like equities have of course been beneficiaries of ultra-
low interest rates. Further local market due diligence highlights expensive price and less than stellar 
customer feedback.

Apple supply chain: Beware the ides of Dialog 
The risk for some time to Dialog was that Apple would internally produce PMICs (Power Management 
Integrated Circuits). Dialog's statement that Apple would dual source for PMICs this year means that 
either this has come to fruition earlier than expected (2019/20 was common thinking) or that Apple is 
dual sourcing externally (Maxim or ON Semi perhaps?). But this shift is a shape of things to come. While 
the stated 5% hit to revenues in 2018 the bigger question is what happens in 2019 and beyond? Design 
shifts, technology changes and Apple's preference to reduce single vendor risk all point to lower 
opportunities for Dialog next year. If 2019 saw a shift to a three vendor strategy (one internal, two 
external) with one per iPhone design then Dialog's business could shrink substantially. If Dialog managed 
to secure more sub-PMIC (explained below) but lost 2/3rds of PMIC main design this could see a $350-
$500M hit revenue run-rate decline. 
Apple is 77% of revenues and all attempts to diversify both customers and products is slow and can't 
mask the fact that Dialog is heavily reliant on Apple business. Apple moving to dual source this year 
would probably imply that one of the iPhone configurations would be non-Dialog this year. Last month 
Dialog had completed designs for 2019 based products and was being taped out to the wafer fabs. These 
are due to be sampled and validated in the second half of 2018 for next year's products but it would be a 
natural progression for Apple to shift further away from Dialog. There is also is a shift towards sub-PMIC 
2019 on smartphones which has begun on the architecture of high end devices. Sub PMICs are required 
to effectively efficiently lay power blocks on a design closer to the functional blocks of a newer 
generation smartphone board (audio package, sensor hubs etc.) but their ASP can as little as 1/10th the 
ASP of a core PMIC. Even if Dialog was able to get a larger piece of the sub PMIC stack, it wouldn't 
offset main PMIC share loss (main PMICs ASPs are $3-$4, sub-PMIC ASPs are $0.2040.50. 
If this had occurred three years ago it would be likely that the current largest shareholder could be seen 
as a potential white knight or interested acquirer. After all, it happens to be Tsinghua Unigroup, the China 
state backed Goliath which is leading the charge to create a semiconductor powerhouse in China. But 
that is unrealistic today and would never get past CFIUS. There is valuation support given Dialog has
