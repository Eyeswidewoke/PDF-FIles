the box , and the packaging are enough for a three year old to see , its shit,,, i told you yesterday 
that breakfast on sat was disgusting„ so today, you did what„ nothing.. the refrigerator looks like 
a high school dorm room„ potatoes in styrofoam, left over sushi, open butter, its disgusting„ i 
never said you couldn't go to publix, i said you cannot send janusch„ JUST LOOK , LOOK in 
the refrig> JUST look at what olga ate. IT has no thought , attention quality„ i once again made 
my own breakfast, while you slept, and i ask you what you contribute„ YOU did get bagels..

I would have taken the checkride if you didn't start a fight. That's a fact. I had 3 short flights 
here in 2 weeks - that's I day of training on the ranch - and I am ready to take it. We wanted 
to schedule it for tomorrow but the examiner was not available so I will have to come back, 
do another flight with brad ,since I will not have flown for a week, and take the test on 
sunday. 
If you don't care where the food is bought why did you yell at me when I went shopping at 
publix and then you made up a rule that nobody is to buy food there for you again. 
Sarah brakes the rule and you reward it, I don't and you announce my granola is shit before you 
even open the box because it looks different than the publix granola you ate before. But I don't 
need to tell you; you have to see it..its so obvious, just think about your reactions

again you don't seem to understand the essence of what i am saying.. i DONT care where it is 
bought„ nor should you.. i want good quality. period„ your granola was shit„ did you taste 
it,did you taste sarahs.. it is that simple„ you serve me shit day after day„ i ask whether you 
tasted the disgusting toast. the answer was no„ though for at least 50 times I've asked you not 
to serve me garbage that you haven't tried. i realize you will then say , but O tasted the pea 
soup and it was fine.. I have no opinion where the food is bought. i don't care„ it is the food .. 
i an not sure why you find this so difficult.. the food you have made recently and bought in the 
store , sperate from the saugage and peppers , is awful... period„ I would like to say thank 
you„ tell me for what. for you offering me a la mer mask to put on my face, for you admitting 
that the omelletes you made were even in your words , not good . no you chose to serve it to 
me„ the first one was not good, so you made it a little better and served it to me „ how crazy„ 
just say„ I can't do it„ would you like something else. , you tell me the only reason you didn't 
get your check ride in new mexico was that you had two days of arguing, its been two weeeks 
since you have been back„ no check ride„ just say It appears I AM not ready , as my e mail
