OptiOpia, Inc. Business Plan for Jeffrey Epstein 
April I . 2011 
might have better success than previous attempts. Potential penetration into this 
market is hard to estimate, but could amount to 10% over 7 years, or 5,600 units in 
the U.S. Penetration may be more successful with financing packages that lower the 
initial purchase cost of the product. Additional sales to schools and national health 
services and non-specialist eyecare providers in Europe, Japan and other countries 
with strong governmental clinical care networks for primary care and vision screening 
are estimated to be about the same as the US market and, conservatively, to adopt 
at the same rate. In the pro forma financials, however, we only include sales in the 
US for this channel and do not include (due to a gap in our research on market 
sizing) expected sales elsewhere in developed world. 
Marketing, promotion, and fulfillment. Non-traditional channels will require significant 
education, awareness building, and marketing to penetrate. Although direct mail 
marketing should be tested and response rates measured, it is likely that magazine 
articles, conference speeches, and general awareness building will be required in 
addition. Furthermore, someone familiar with supporting the school market (and its 
unique purchasing approaches) will be needed. As such, the best approach will be to 
partner with a firm already selling into the education market, such as a publisher, 
book distributor, or software provider. Major publishers selling into the educational 
market include McGraw Hill ($1.1 billion), Pearson ($1.1 billion), Harcourt ($755 
million), and Houghton Mifflin ($751 million) 3, who would likely carry the product 
more to build their brand (esp. a private label option) than for the incremental sales. 
Such a partner could also access the opaque state-level and district level purchasing 
processes, introducing a scalable marketing approach. 
Expansion of the vision screening market in the US alone will involve selling to slow-
to-buy. cash-strapped state health and education agencies. We believe that meeting 
the American people's public health needs by developing this product in an American 
company like OptiOpia is best accomplished by developing a product for production 
and marketing that can benefit from economies of scale, for a global marketplace, to 
meet global needs, and to focus our best energies on entering markets with nimble 
private actors that can appreciate and act swiftly (i.e., buy) upon a pure economic 
value proposition. This market segment is attractive but will mature slowly. 
Non-Traditional Customers in Developing World: 
The hardest customers to tap will be the non-traditional customers in the developing 
world including primary health care workers, pharmacists, and micro-entrepreneur 
retailers. However, it also represents a very large potential market and the single best 
hope for reducing uncorrected refractive error globally. 
The influential book The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid by C.K. Pralahad 
persuasively emphasizes the power of entrepreneurs and private markets in 
developing countries to create wealth and customer/client/patient satisfaction in 
response to market-enablers such as lower financing costs/creative financing, new

numbers are from a document OptiOpia prepared in 2008 and may be obsolete.
