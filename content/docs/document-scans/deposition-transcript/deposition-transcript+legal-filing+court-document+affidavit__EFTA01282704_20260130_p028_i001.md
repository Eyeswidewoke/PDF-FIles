delivered to Buyer or the Transaction is terminated under paragraph 10(g)) 
to the Repurchase Date (or, if later, the date on which Equivalent Securities 
are delivered to Seller or the Transaction is terminated under paragraph 
10(h)). the difference between (A) the Repurchase Price at the relevant time 
multiplied by the applicable Margin Ratio (or. where the Transaction relates 
to Securities of more than one description to which different Margin Ratios 
apply, the amount produced by multiplying the Repurchase Price 
attributable to Equivalent Securities of each such description by the 
applicable Margin Ratio and aggregating the resulting amounts, the 
Repurchase Price being for this purpose attributed to Equivalent Securities 
of each such description in the same proportions as those in which the 
Purchase Price was apportioned among the Purchased Securities) and (B) 
the Market Value of Equivalent Securities at the relevant time. 
In each case, if (A) is greater than (B). Buyer has a Transaction Exposure for that 
Transaction equal to the excess, and if (B) is greater than (A), Seller has a 
Transaction Exposure to Buyer equal to the excess."

FATCA PROVISIONS. 
(a) 
Paragraph 5 "Income Payments" shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following: 
"5. Unless otherwise agreed: 
(a) 
where the Term of a particular Transaction extends over an Income Payment Date in 
respect of any Securities subject to that Transaction, Buyer shall on the date such 
Income is paid by the issuer transfer to or credit to the account of Seller an amount 
equal to (and in the same currency as) the amount paid by the issuer; 
(b) 
where Margin Securities are transferred from one party ("the first party") to the other 
party ("the second party") and an Income Payment Date in respect of such Securities 
occurs before Equivalent Margin Securities are transferred by the second party to the 
first party, the second party shall on the date such Income is paid by the issuer 
transfer to or credit to the account of the first party an amount equal to (and in the 
same currency as) the amount paid by the issuer, 
and for the avoidance of doubt references in this paragraph to the amount of Income 
paid by the issuer of any Securities shall be to an amount paid without any 
withholding or deduction for or on account of taxes or duties notwithstanding that a 
payment of such Income made in certain circumstances may be subject to a 
withholding or deduction, except, where a withholding or deduction for or on account 
of taxes or duties has been imposed under FATCA, to the extent an equivalent or 
greater amount of withholding or deduction for or on account of taxes or duties 
would have been imposed under FATCA in respect of Income paid by the issuer on 
such Securities (or Margin Securities, as applicable) had the Seller (or the first party. 
as applicable) retained the Securities (or the Margin Securities, as applicable)."
