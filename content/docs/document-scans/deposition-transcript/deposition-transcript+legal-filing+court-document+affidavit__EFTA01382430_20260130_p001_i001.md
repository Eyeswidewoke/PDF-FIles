in Other current liabilities, and $72.7 million and $82.8 million, respectively, recorded in Other long-term liabilities. These proceeds are 
amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated sublease term as rent income and were $12.6 million for fiscal 2014, and $12.5 
million for both fiscal 2013 and 2012. 
In addition, deferred gains have been recorded in connection with several sale-leaseback transactions and are recognized over the 
lives of the leases. The current portion of deferred gains related to sale-leaseback transactions at February 28, 2015 and February 20, 
2014 were $12.5 million and $13.4 million, respectively, recorded in Other current liabilities, with the long-term portion of $183.3 million 
and $209.6 million at February 28, 2015 and February 20, 2014, respectively, recorded in Other long-term liabilities. Amortization of 
deferred gains related to sale-leaseback transactions were $13.4 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is recorded as 
a reduction in rent expense. 
Benefit plans: Substantially all of the Company's employees are covered by various contributory and non-contributory pension, 
profit sharing or 401(k) plans. in addition to dedicated defined benefit plans for Safeway, Shaw's and United employees. Certain 
employees participate in a long-term retention incentive bonus plan. Most union employees participate in multiemployer retirement plans 
under collective bargaining agreements, unless the collective bargaining agreement provides for participation in plans sponsored by the 
Company. The Company also provides certain health and welfare benefits, including short-term and long-term disability benefits to 
inactive disabled employees prior to retirement. 
The Company recognizes a liability for the under-funded status of the defined benefit plans as a component of Other long-term 
liabilities. Actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits are recorded within Other comprehensive income (loss). The 
determination of the Company's obligation and related expense for its sponsored pensions and other post-retirement benefits is 
dependent, in part, on management's selection of certain actuarial assumptions in calculating these amounts. These assumptions 
indude, among other things, the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Pension expense for the 
multiemployer plans is recognized as contributions are funded. 
Revenue recognition: Revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale to the customer, net of returns and 
sales tax. Discounts provided to customers by the Company at the time of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products 
are sold. Discounts provided to customers by vendors, usually in the form of coupons, are not recognized as a reduction in sales, 
provided the coupons are redeemable at any retailer that accepts coupons. The Company recognizes revenue and records a 
corresponding receivable from the vendor for the difference between the sales prices and the cash received from the customer. The 
Company records a deferred revenue liability when it sells its own proprietary gift cards. The Company records a sale when the customer 
redeems the gift card. The gift cards do not expire. The Company reduces the liability and records revenue for the unused portion of gift 
cards ("breakage") after two to five years, the period at which redemption is considered remote. Breakage amounts were immaterial for 
fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
Cost of sales and vendor allowances: Cost of sales includes, among other things, purchasing, inbound freight costs, product 
quality testing costs, warehousing costs, internal transfer costs, advertising costs, private label program costs and strategic sourcing 
program costs. 
The Company receives vendor allowances or rebates (Vendor Allowances") for a variety of merchandising initiatives and buying 
activities. The terms of the Company's Vendor Allowances arrangements vary in length but are primarily expected to be completed within 
a quarter. The Company records Vendor Allowances as a reduction of Cost of sales when the associated products are sold.
