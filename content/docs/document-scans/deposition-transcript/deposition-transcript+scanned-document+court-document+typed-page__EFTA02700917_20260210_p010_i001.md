As soon as he left the gates of the Vatican, Leemans placed a telephone call to Milan which 
interrupted the tense Board of Directors meeting of the Banco Ambrosiano. "Call in 
Grandmother", Leemans said,which was the prearranged signal to ask the Bank of Italy to take 
over the bank. It was the last meeting that the Board of Directors ever held. Trading in its shares 
was immediately suspended. The 86 year old bank, founded by priests in Milan, had expired. 
While the stunned employees of the bank milled around , a grey-haired woman plummeted from 
the executive office on the top floor to her death on the pavement below. Amidst the commotion, 
the acting president interrupted a press briefing to announce "Calvi's secretary just killed herself." 
Graziela Corrocher not only had been Calvi's secretary since he had become head of the bank, 
she was the only other person at the bank that knew the his full calendar of appointments and 
meetings. She left behind a note scrawled in red that cursed Calvi. 
Later that evening at an office on the Avenue Des Citronniers in Monte Carlo, the employee on 
duty received a phone call ordering him to immediately close down what had been the European 
headquarters of Bank Ambrosiano Overseas in the Bahamas. His 11 years of night duty in this 
lonely room had consisted mainly of typing cryptic telephone messages from Milan into a telex 
machine, which had been specially constructed so that, unlike standard machines, it did not 
produce any copy on paper of its messages. There was also no paper trail of the work done here 
which, unknown to him or the other employee of this branch office, had resulted in transferring 
over $1.2 billion borrowed by the Banco Ambrosiano and its subsidiaries from banks around the 
world to a handful of anonymous corporations in Panama and Liechtenstein. 
By this time the corpse of Calvi had been cut down from under Blackfriars Bridge in London 
and the Italian counsel in London cabled Rome "They have our banker." That ended the search 
for Calvi, but there was a greater a greater mystery: the whereabouts of the money. 
The trail of money, which began at the Banco Ambrosiano in Milan and then passed through its 
subsidiary in Monte Carlo, had stopped cold in Panama. The money had been transferred there, 
and in other off-shore banking centers, to anonymous corporations. Although records indicated 
that they were owned by the Vatican, the Vatican denied that it controlled their financial 
activities. And indeed, the precise relationship between these shadowy companies and the 
Vatican was known by no more than three persons at the Banco Ambrosiano. They were Carlo 
Canesi, who had made the original arrangements with the Vatican in the late sixties, Calvi, who 
was his assistant and successor, and possibly Graziela Corrocher, the personal secretary for both 
men. And all three of them were now dead. Nor could any documents be found, except for the 
two ambiguous "letters of patronage" in the bank's records that were disputed by the Vatican. 
The problem was that Calvi had left Italy with a black attache case full of key documents but it 
had not been recovered in London. 
If the answer to the mystery could not be found in Milan or London, investigators had to seek 
it in the Vatican, a the sovereign state occupying some 108 acres in the heart of Rome. Despite 
its priceless works of art, and valuable property in Italy in the form of churches and other 
religious edifices, the Vatican had problems raising cash to meet its budget. It received no 
financial assistance from Catholic dioceses around the world, except for the annual Peter's Pence 
collection. It did have, the Vatican Bank, which, it will be recalled, Pope Pius had created in 
1942 under the guise of an "Institute for the Works of Religion." The IOR, as it is called by its 
Italian initials, allowed the Vatican, instead of commercial banks, to earn the profits on banking 
transactions. It also operated outside the purview of the Bank of Italy or any other central bank. 
Technically, because the Vatican was an independent state, the Italian government did not have
