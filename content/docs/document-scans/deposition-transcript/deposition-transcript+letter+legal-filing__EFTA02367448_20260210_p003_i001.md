On 3, there is a place for probabilities in the study of use of language (e.g., Charles Yang's 
integration of UG and learning theory in study of acquisition), but there is no indication of how they might enter into (-
language. The concepts don't seem relevant. 
As for category theory, it makes sense to appeal to it if the results obtained at this level of 
abstraction have implications for the particular system under investigation. I don't see how it would be true in this case. 
Would we, say, learn more about the roots and implications of the copy theory of displacement if we abstracted to 
category theory? I don't see how. 
I'll ask Valeria if she's gotten the book yet. Sounds like a great evening.

1. the terms - value , money ,and currency- need definition. separate and apart from an intrinsic 
worth to an individual , the hungry one . or the Indian tooth manufacturer, either can actually be consumed or 
merely stand as a store of value or medium of exchange. a piece of paper representing either is the familiar form of 
money, . a dollar bill.. as you know the US version used to say the convertible into something. ( gold silver ) . now it 
says trust me. its worth one dollar.. the trading of dollars is well known. 
I wondered whether sentences ( concepts 
without being necessarily written on paper. could be , looked at the same way. some having intrinsic value and others 
being used as exchange. I see no reason why not, does that set up an economics of sentences /concepts. .

think you might enjoy the taste of a new math. 
I read your attached paper. I would suggest that the system of analysis suffers from the use of 
early twentieth century reasoning , ie references to Merge. minimal computation ( the set notation can be misleading ) 
or modules. I think a system and notation that might, just might, help and add interesting insights is -category theory. 
fresher, more useful then either the former popular set theory or group theory of the 20th century . where for 
example mc would be contained in a larger category. ( your Merge would fall into a subcategory of operations that 
were a combination of associative , transitive operations in a space etc . One then looks at the spaces of probabilities 
and realizes that some are just much more probable than others . nothing more. these probabilities generate shapes 
only as a result of their statistical ensembles. - the age old study of soap bubbles suffered from the same handicap. . 
the shapes were analyzed by attempting to follow the mc rule. ie containing the most volume for the least area. ( a 
broader category ) now i would propose that the shape merely represents its most probable shape- nothing more. 
given the statistical space. for ex, things on the membrane , free to move but the shape not changing. 
I understand 
that language is not an input output system like vision. Shapes are not input /output devices but have very strong
