of communities boarded up. And yet our cities have been relatively quiet. 
Crime remains at its lowest point since the early 1970s, public housing 
complexes have not fallen into disrepair, and large numbers of homeless 
people have not emerged on the streets. Although it has been labeled the 
Great Recession, he says that it should be call the Private Recession, as 
hardships facing many American families have never made it onto the streets 
other than the Occupy Wall Street protests and Tea Party rallies, both 
allowing their believers to blow off steam. 
But really caught my initial interest was the article's title -'The Urban 
Fire Next time,' as it cause me to reflect on James Baldwin's brilliant and 
provocative 1963 book - *The Fire Next Time'. The book consists of two 
essays, both examining the so called "Negro Problem" 'in America in the 
early 1960's ("Negro" was the term then in use for 'African-American', 
and is used interchangeably with the term "black"' in this book. The use 
of both terms in this analysis is therefore reflective of their usage in 
the book, and of the socio-cultural-literary context in which they were 
written). Themes other than "the Negro Problem" 'explored by the book 
include an examination of the shallowness and ineffectiveness of religious 
faith, and of inter-generational influences and relationships. I was so 
taken by this book that in my early 20s I sought out James Baldwin in Paris 
and we became friends to his death in 1987.

This is a book that Mitt Romney should have read, because if he had he 
might have understood why his *47% comment was egregious and in a sense 
racist, even though the 47% included whites, but it included them in a way 
that "they are Niggers (Spics, Fags, Ragheads, Chinks, poor white trash) 
too."* Also every Republican should read, 'The Fire Next Time', including 
Latino Republicans, especially people like Marco Rubio, who like myself try 
to walk the fine line between our ethnicity and the establishment, that 
tells us that our success is because we are different from our ethnic 
brothers and sisters. And if you really want to understand why Tamerlan 
and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev became radicalized, you too should read James 
Baldwin's 'The Fire Next Time', and substitute the word 'Negro 'with *Mush= 
or 'Arab'. And to be honest, the same is true for our foreign policy, 
where the term 'American Exceptionalism* is often used in condescension 
(much like the Silent Majority, separating them from us), instead of a 
beacon of light for those who want to join. 
But getting back to Sharkey's article, 'The Urban Fire Next Time', he 
points out that the gutting of urban social programs that have kept 
minorities, the poor and the disaffected young could have grave 
consequences, and the bombing of the Boston Marathon and the Newtown 
massacre are the most recent examples - like the messages in 'The Fire 
Next Time', if heeded by the establishment might have reduced the angst 
that led to the 1960$ urban riots. How many more mass shootings and 
bombings do we have to endure before our political and business leaders 
realize, that diluting the strength of the safety net that the elderly, 
poor, minorities and the young rely on to survive and more importantly to
