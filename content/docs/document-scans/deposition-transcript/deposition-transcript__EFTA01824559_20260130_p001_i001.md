supported your decisions . though they were contrary to what i had told you would be in your

you arc right... I've tried to take the easy way because I saw all my friends out of this industry 
struggling with their jobs, not being happy, not being able to enjoy life, just being stressed of 
money and work. I didn't want to take that path yet, I felt that I can still enjoy the freedom 
that I have by doing this job. But I'm not earning so much that I can be happy about it. I 
always earn the money that I can pay for rent and food,but not more that I can afford to do 
more, or to buy things I want and I need. Now I want more and need more than before. I'm 
not a teenager that could live just with fun anymore. For the past days I wasn't able to sleep 
because all of the crazy thoughts and dreams I had. And I see people around me doing nothing 
and are so happy about it. Is it that bad to think instead of smile? or smile because u think!? 
What can I do? I want you to trust me...

yes! This is what I want. I want to move to London and try to get a real job. U 
said u might be able to help me in a way. U were saying something about 
refrigerated food industry. I want to try anything, I'm not afraid of trying and of 
change. 
I wanted to come here for my ego, and for the hot wether. I like it here, I'm not 
so stressed as I was in NY. 
I know is really difficult to get a good job, and I need your help for that. In a 
month I want to go back to London and try to do something.
