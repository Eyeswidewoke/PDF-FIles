other than harsh interrogation techniques, although =he agency concedes that it's possible. "It is impossible =o imagine 
how CIA could have achieved the same results in terms of disrupting plots, capturing othe= terrorists, and degrading al-
Qa'ida without any information from de=ainees, but it is unknowable whether, without enhanced interrogation 
techniques, CIA or non-CIA interrogators could have acquired the same information from those detainees," the rebuttal 
said. 
Still, the CIA is not advocating a return=to the use of torture during interrogations. Rather, it is most concerned with 
defe=ding itself against charges that it misled Congress and the White House about th= extent and value of the program. 
The official response vehemently cha=lenges the Senate's allegation that the spies acted outside the limits of what=the 
White House had allowed the agency to do. The agency has said that th= enhanced interrogations were part of a 
government-approved program carried out under express orders from within the Bush administration. 
<= class="MsoNormal">"The image portrayed in the Study of an organization that — on an institutional scale—
intentionally=misled and routinely resisted oversight from the White House, the Congress, the Department of Justice, 
and its own OIG simply does not comport with the record," =he agency's response said. 
Among the Senate report's 20 main conclusions are tha= the CIA misled Congress, the White House and the Department 
of Justice, that the ag=ncy ignored internal critiques of the program, and that the CIA's use of th= techniques went far 
beyond the legal authority bestowed upon it by the Bush White House. In a statement Tuesday, President Barack Obama 
said, "=he report documents a troubling program involving enhanced interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects i= 
secret facilities outside the United States, and it reinforces my long-held view that these harsh methods were not only 
inconsistent with our values as nation, they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our nati=nal security 
interests." "That is why I will continue to use my autho=ity as President to make sure we never resort to those methods 
again," Obama added. 
"In carryi=g out that program, we did not always live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves and that the 
American people expec= of us," CIA Director John Brennan said Tuesday in his official respon=e. "As an Agency, we have 
learned from these mistakes, which is why my predecessors and I have implemented various remedial measures over 
the years to address institutional deficiencies.&quo=; 
The agency says it has no intention of revamping the current version of its interrogation program, which was curbed as a 
result of directives from Obama. "It is Director Brennan's resolute intention to ensure that Agency officer= scrupulously 
adhere to these directives, which the Director fully supports," the statement continued. "CIA has owned up to these 
mistakes, learned from them, and taken numerous corrective actions over the years. Further improvements to CIA 
practices continue to be made today as a result of our review of the SSCI Study," the agency's response=noted, referring 
to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the intelligence panel's full name. 
The document's release marks the conclusion of an =xplosive, high-stakes feud that played out between the White 
House's chief sp=ing agency and its powerful Senate overseers about how much of the report to release publicly. The
