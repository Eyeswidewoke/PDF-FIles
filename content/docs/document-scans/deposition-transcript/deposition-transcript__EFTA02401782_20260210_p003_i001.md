I'm sure you might think that photography is not a real job but it=can turn into 
one if I do it well. At the beginning I will earn no money w=th it since I have to learn and I will probably need to work in a 
shop or =omething to earn some money. My question is how do I learn by assisting a =hotographer if I work in a shop all 
day ?? How can I earn money to pay my =ent and living and in the same time learn a new skill in order to grow in =hat 
specific field ? I'm not sure how I should manage this...

Ps: I am meeting with Jean Baptiste Huynh the photogra=her on Friday ( we 
went at his studio together once ). I think he is the p=rfect base to start with if I want to learn about photography 
specially fo= the use of light. He is excellent in this and I could learn a lot from hi=. I love his work

repeating the same wrong path over and over- I apol=gize for this. I will never be thankful enough. Thanks to you I've

life and myself that I can only be thankf=l with you. I want to make you happy and I'm sorry I've disappoint=d you. It's by
