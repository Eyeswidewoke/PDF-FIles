CRN 6750 Sec A 
Environmental problems that reach across borders are among the most pressing issues facing us 
today, including biodiversity loss. climate change. and ocean depletion. Yet while the scales may 
be international or global, these environmental issues are generated in highly charged local 
contexts that bring people, animals. plants. rocks, and technology into collision in unusual ways. 
The course investigates how these diverse actors come together in global environmental politics. 
using concepts of power, sovereignty. resistance, and surveillance to make sense of these 
relations. In the first part of the course, we discuss some common political ways of framing global 
environmental problems. The remainder of the course will focus on specific case studies. ranging 
from the environmental surveillance of migratory leatherback turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. to the 
changing nature of wilderness preservation, to the wolves, moose, and scientists who co-inhabit 
an isolated island in Lake Superior. <div>Students must register for both the lecture and

Cinemetrics develops observation, participation, notation and design skills for students from all 
fields as a necessary tool kit for detecting and initiating change in the environment. Cinemetrics 
combines lessons in ecological surveillance and human empathy through participatory freehand 
drawing and digital video exercises. These exercises are self-reflective methods of watching, 
participating, and recording the larger patterns of change around us in order to set In motion new 
patterns of change. Using phenomenology, semiotics and cinematographic techniques of 
perception and representation, students examine and record their own bodies, clothing, domestic 
objects, friends, strangers, interiors, and New York street life in terms of shape, form, space. 
movement and time for instance how weather patterns and traffic movements affect social life. 
The recognition of patterns of change forms a basis for developing strategies for initiating subtle 
transformations in the dynamics of the world around us. The course uses as examples three films 
by Yasujiro Ozu, Jean-Luc Godard and John Cassavetes. employing the cinema techniques of 
framing, shooting and assembling movement and time Images combined with performance, free 
hand drawing and mapping exercises. <div>Students must register for both the lecture and

From the Colonial era to the present, the most forceful political writers have also been prose 
masters who have struck a balance between argument and literary technique in their attempt to 
clarify the contradictions and tensions of American democracy. This course will examine how the 
best writers have done through close readings and discussion of selected welts, past and present-
including classics of political argument (the Federalist Papers, speeches by Lincoln, Martin Luther 
King. Jr., Barack Obama). opinion columns (from Walter Lippmann and H. L Mencken to David 
Brooks and Frank Rich), analytical essays and commentary (Richard Hofstadter. Edmund Wilson, 
Garry Wills), and narratives (James Baldwin. Joan Didion, Norman Mailer. David Remnick, Marjorie 
Williams). <div>Students must register for both the lecture and discussion section of this
