same time reinforced the point. There is a yawning gul= between a trader's pragmatic view of financial markets and a 
wider poli=ical and public audience who generally interpret the market maker's pragmatism as cynicism, detachment 
and shor= termism, especially when it results in making a lot of money. 
Banks tend to be highly impatient with this public and po=itical ambivalence. Most banks' response to 
efforts at greater regulatio= of securities markets have often been rooted in the argument that these m=rkets are 
fundamentally a forum for free trade between consenting adults and should be treated as such. It is =his argument that 
the LIBOR-scandal, with its taint of market fixing, and =he persistent flow of suggestions of contempt for customers and 
clients, d=es so much to undermine. 
The events of the last two months have succeeded in cemen=ing for good the idea that the banking 
crisis of 2008 was ultimately the r=sult of unethical, 'casino' behaviour on the trading floor. Whatever f=ilings banks 
might have exhibited in their ethical standards here, the reality is that the banking crisis had i=s roots in poor lending 
and risk standards, and poor management of loan bark funding, rather than wild gambles or duplicity in the securities 
markets= The Vickers Commission explicitly recognised this by focusing on raising capital standards at the retail ban=s 
that make up the backbone of the British credit system. 
Recent huge losses in the Chief Investment Office at 1 P =organ and conduct like that of Barclays' traders 
have made this di=tinction far too subtle to insist upon politically. This may not matter mu=h in regulatory terms —
regulators have already embarked on a wide range of securities markets reforms. But it wil= help embed the persistent 
political idea that retail banking is inherentl= 'safe' while investment banking and securities markets business is 
in=erently 'risky'. To which recent events have added the taint of suspect ethical conduct. 
For universal bank leaders who have come out of the secur=ties world, this is likely to be part of the 
challenge of dealing with pol=ticians and regulators over the next few years. Politicians actively quest=oned Mr 
Diamond's credentials to lead a retail bank when he was appointed Barclays CEO in 2011. His departu=e leaves an even 
greater burden on universal bank leaders to understand th= growing political gap between the skillset desired of retail 
bank managem=nt and the caricature of the men and women who make a living on the trading desks. Mr Diamond 
maintained a =lass office on the trading floor at Barcap even after his transition to le=dership of Barclays; a gesture 
heavy with meaning for his critics. c/=pan> 
Mr Diamond's instincts were to close this gap by champi=ning a 'citizenship' agenda for Barclays. The 
main problem with this i= not the agenda, or the work that was done by the bank in its name. It was=the persistent 
undermining of this message by the perceived conduct of the bank itself. Not just questions of culture=and character 
raised by the admission that traders had sought to manipulat= LIBOR rates for personal and institutional profit and the 
mis-selling of =ayments insurance and interest rate hedges for small businesses. But also fundamental questions over 
the =ank's business model, the way it rewards its highest earners including M= Diamond himself, its approach to its own 
tax affairs and the 'aggressiv=ness' of the tax services it provides to clients, irrespective of their legality. In this, obviously 
Barclays is=far from alone. 
Politicians are at something of a loss as to how concrete=y to address these issues of values and 
character and this poses a particu=ar challenge for banks. Culture is hard to regulate and the public have no=real 
appetite or patience for reassurances that a renewed rigour from supervisors will fix the problem. The proxies f=r 
culture are going to be pay and senior accountability, and these are the=two things that ultimately tripped up Mr 
Diamond at Barclays. Althou=h many in banking would like to argue that these things are beside the point, politically 
they are the point. 
like much else in the current banking model, the case for=remuneration levels in banking is based 
purely on the logic and discipline=of the free market for financial services. Yet the bailouts of 2008 and th= LIBOR-fixing 
scandal have further exhausted political and regulatory patience with the idea that banking exi=ts in a free market. High 
levels of remuneration are also glaringly at odd= with the wider economic context and the prevailing political climate.
