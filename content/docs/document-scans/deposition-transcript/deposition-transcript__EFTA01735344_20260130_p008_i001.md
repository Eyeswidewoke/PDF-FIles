Q. He said "Hi, how are you?" 
5 
A. Uh huh. 
6 
Q. Yes? 
7 
A. Yes. 
8 
Q. And did you, was that after you stopped going 
9 
to Mr. Epstein's house or during the time that you were 
10 
going to Mr. Epstein's house that you saw him jogging on 
11 
the beach? 
12 
A. I don't exactly remember when it was. I think 
13 
it was when I was still going. 
14 
Q. Okay. So the only time that you've ever 
15 
spoken with Mr. Epstein outside of his home would have 
16 
been the one time you saw him out jogging on the beach 
17 
and you were at the beach over in Palm Beach, correct? 
18 
MR. HOROWITZ: Form. 
19 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, I thought I saw him in Key

touch your buttocks, correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Okay. And that's all he touched was your 
buttocks, correct? 
MR. HOROWITZ: Form. Again, you are talking 
about the conversation? 
BY MR. CRITTON: 
Q. Only what you told the Palm Beach police. 
A. As to what I can remember, I'm not if you 
could show me, I don't exactly remember. 
Q. I'm asking your best recollection. I'm 
looking at the police report. 
A. Okay. 
Q. Did you also tell the Palm Beach police that 
at no time did he touch any of your private areas? 
A. I don't remember telling them that he did. 
Q. Okay. In fact, you told them he 
specifically -- they asked you, did he touch, did he 
touch you in your private area, in your vaginal area, 
and you said no, correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And they asked you whether he had touched your 
breast, and you said no, correct? 
A. I don't remember.

Q. And Mr. Epstein has never flown you or asked 
2 
you to travel anyplace, has he, where you traveled? 
3 
A. No. 
4 
Q. That's correct? 
5 
A. Yes. 
6 
Q. All right. First time, at least what you told 
7 
the police officers, your best recollection is that you 
8 
went over there with H.R., you went upstairs, and you 
9 
gave Mr. Epstein a massage, comet? 
10 
A. Yes. 
11 
Q. Okay. And during the course of the massage, 
12 
you kept your clothes on, true? 
13 
A. I believe that's what I told them. 
14 
Q. All right. And you also told the police that 
15 
at no time did he try to touch you or did he touch you, 
16 
correct? 
17 
A. I told them that he did try to touch my butt. 
18 
Q. Okay. He did try? 
19 
A. Or he did, I think I said. 
20 
Q. What's the difference between trying and 
21 
touching? 
22 
A. I don't exactly remember the words I said. I 
23 
think I did tell them that he did. 
24 
Q. So it's now your testimony that you recall 
25 
tellinehe Palm Beach Police Department that he did

statement says, that's what you would have told them. 
2 
If I ask you to assume that that's at least 
3 
the information that they have is that he did not touch 
4 
you in any, quote, unquote, private area, that would be 
5 
accurate?

areas, did you?

MR. HOROWITZ: Form. 
14 
THE WITNESS: No. 
15 
BY MR. CRITTON: 
16 
Q. In fact, in any of the visits you ever went to 
17 
Mr. Epstein's home, you never touched him in his genital 
18 
area, did you? 
19 
A. No. 
20 
MR. HOROWITZ: Form. Pm sorry, I'm doing 
21
