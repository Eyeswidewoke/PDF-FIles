served as a staging post for the international operations of the Banco Ambrosiano. Although it 
had been unprecedented for an Archbishop of the Vatican Curia to sit on the Board of Directors 
of a private bank, Marcinkus believed,as he told me in 1983, "extraordinary times called for 
extraordinary measures." The son of an immigrant window washer in Cicero,Illinois, he had 
come to the Vatican in 1950 as a 28 year old student priest, and never left. He quickly rose 
through the ranks of the bureaucracy to become the right hand of first Pope Paul and then Pope 
John Paul IL Three months before Calvi's disappearance the Pope had stood by Marcinkus' side 
at a meeting of the fifteen Cardinals on the Commission for Vatican Finances. When questions 
were raised about the Vatican's faltering income and rising deficits, the Pope had held his hand 
up to Marcinkus,and replied "If you have any problems--ask (him], he'll know how to solve 
them." The Cardinals also had no doubts about Marcinkus' loyalty to the Pope: he had,as one 
Cardinal remarked,"the fidelity of a Saint Bernard." 
When Marcinkus returned with the Pope from Geneva, he immediately met with Leemans. 
Leemans came right to the point by producing two documents that he had been sent from 
Luxembourg on the chartered jet. Marcinkus saw that they were "letters of patronage", signed 
by his deputy and initialed by him. They clearly identified the Vatican Bank as the owner of the 
key anonymous companies through which the Vatican had incurred huge debts. Leemans 
explained that the Banco Ambrosiano Group would be forced into bankruptcy in a matter of 
hours unless these debts were repaid by the Vatican. 
The Archbishop replied that the Vatican recognized no debt to the Bank Ambrosiano. He 
dismissed the letters of patronage as legally meaningless because he held a trump card --a 
"counter-letter," signed by Calvi, which released the Vatican from any responsibility proceeding 
from the "Letters of Patronage." As far as he was concerned, signing these letters of patronage 
was merely a personal mistake on his part. "I did it purely as an act of friendship to Calvi", he 
told Leemans. "I realize that I will have to pay personally for that error of judgment." 
Leemans could not accept this explanation at face value. He did not believe that these letters of 
patronage, which involved the Vatican in a debt exceeding one billion dollars,had been simply 
dashed out by Marcinkus as a token of friendship— they had not even been signed by Marcinkus . 
Moreover, before these letters had been issued, Marcinkus had sent his deputy to Lugano, 
Switzerland to see secret records held in a bank vault— a vault in which the Vatican held one key 
and the Banco Ambrosiano the other. These records confirmed that the Vatican's bank was listed 
as the owner of record of the companies in question. They also showed that these companies held 
as their main asset over ten per cent of the shares of the Banco Ambrosiano. If so, Leemans 
reasoned that the Archbishop had an interest in issuing the letters that went beyond personal 
friendship for Calvi. 
But the Vatican was a sovereign state which did not have answer to any authority other 
than the Pope. It could only be sued in a court in the Vatican with the permission of the Pope. If 
Marcinkus stood his ground and insisted that the letters, and whatever other evidence turned up, 
proceeded from his personal errors and naivety, the Vatican could not be held legally responsible 
for the huge debt . Seeing that there was no practical way around the stone wall erected by 
Marcinkus, Leemans suggested that they both work together to prevent the collapse of the Banco 
Ambrosiano with all the attendant public revelations. Specifically,he proposed raising a loan on 
the world market for the Vatican bank which would be used to save the Banco Ambrosiano. 
The Archbishop, calculating that the interest for such a loan would amount to more than a 
hundred million dollars a year, told Leemans "We just don't have that kind of money."
