Health 
Who should get tested for COVID-19? 
• 
Testing should only be used for people who need to be hospitalized for severe illness like 
pneumonia. This protects health care workers and may affect treatment options. 
• 
At this point, if you have symptoms, assume that you have COVID-19. A positive test will not 
change what a doctor tells you to do to get better. The best course of action is to stay at home. 
• 
If you are only mildly ill, you can save the life of another New Yorker by staying home to ensure 
health care resources go to those who need them the most. Take care of others by staying home. 
What should I do if I get sick with COVID-19 symptoms? 
• If you have mild to moderate symptoms, stay home. You should not seek medical care or try to 
get tested. By staying home, you reduce the possibility of transmission to others, including health 
care workers who are needed to care for the more seriously ill. 
• 
If you are over 50 years old or have chronic conditions, consult your doctor. They may want to 
monitor you more closely. 
• 
If your symptoms do not go away or get worse after three to four days, consult with your doctor. 
• 
Stay home for at least seven days after your symptoms started. Make sure that you have been 
fever-free for three days without the use of fever-reducing drugs, such as Tylenol and ibuprofen. 
Also, make sure that your cough and sore throat are better before you go back to your routine. If 
you never had a fever, stay at home for at least three days after your symptoms start improving. 
• 
If you go out to see your doctor, wear a face mask if available.lf possible, take a private car, sit in 
the back seat and roll down the window. 
• 
If you have more severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing and very high fever, go to an 
emergency department. Call 911 if you need help right away. 
What should I do if I'm sick at home? Assume you have COVID-19! 
• 
Do not leave your home except to get medical care or to address other essential needs, such as 
getting groceries. 
• 
Do not go to school or to work. 
• 
Do not take public transportation. Do not use ride shares or taxis. 
• 
Separate yourself from others in your home, as much as possible. Stay in a different room. Use a 
separate bathroom if available. If you share a bathroom, disinfect frequently touched surfaces 
after each use. 
• 
Wear a face mask if available when you need to be in areas with others. 
• 
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. 
• 
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve when sneezing or coughing. Do not use 
your hands to cover your sneeze or cough. Immediately throw out tissues and wash your hands 
afterward. 
• 
Clean surfaces that are frequently touched, such as counters, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures and 
phones. Clean them after each use or at least once every day. Use a household cleaning spray 
or wipe. 
• 
Do not share personal household items, such as glasses, cups, eating utensils and towels. 
• 
Do not have visitors come to your home. 
The NYC Health Department may change recommendations as the situation evolves.
