DUPLICATE COPY 
...continued from previous page We will do this if over six billing periods the sum of payments credited to your Pay Over lime balance is 
more than the sum of the Pay Over Time Minimum Dues (not adjusted, except any Pay Over Time amount 
past due is counted only in the first of those six periods). We will also make the adjustment if over six billing 
periods the sum of the Pay Over Time Minimum Dues (not adjusted) is not more than $120 and equals the 
sum of payments credited to your Pay Over Time balance. However, we will not make the adjustment if the 
sum of the Pay Over Time Minimum Dues is zero and we did not adjust the Pay Over Time Minimum Due 
the last time it was not zero. 
About Interest charges on Pay Over Time balances 
When we charge interest 
For charges added at your request 
We charge interest on charges that are added at 
your request to a Pay Over 'lime balance as of the 
date the charge S added. If you pay the Account 
Total New Balance on a statement by the Closing 
Date on the next statement then on that next 
statement we will not charge interest on any Pay 
Over Time portion of that Account Total New 
Balance. 
For charges added automatically 
We charge interest on charges that are added 
automatically to a Pay Over Time balance beginning 
on the transaction date. However, you can avoid 
paying interest on those charges as described 
below. 
If you pay the Account Total New Balance on a 
statement by the Closing Date shown on the next 
statement, then on that next statement we will not 
charge interest on those charges. 
If you paid the Account Total Previous Balance on a 
statement by its Closing Date, and you pay less than 
the Account Total New Balance on that statement by 
the Closing Date of the next statement then we will 
not charge interest on the portion of automatically 
added charges that we apply your payment to. But 
we will charge interest on the remaining portion of 
those charges. 
Also, we will not charge interest on automatically 
added charges shown on a statement if the Account 
Total Previous Balance on that statement is zero or 
a credit balance. 
How we calculate Interest 
CMAEUACM0002101 
We calculate interest for a billing period by first figuring the interest on each balance. Balances within each 
feature—such as Select & Pay Later, Sign & Travel and Extended Payment Option—may have different 
interest rates. 
We use the Average Daily Balance method 
(including new transactions) to figure interest 
charges for each balance. The total interest charged 
for a billing period is the sum of the interest charged 
on each balance. 
Interest 
The interest charged for a balance in a billing period. 
except for variations caused by rounding, equals: 
• Average Daily Balance (ADB) x 
• Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) x 
• number of days the DPR was in effect. 
ADB 
To get the ADO for a balance, we add up its daily 
balances. Then we divide the result by the number 
of days the DPR for that balance was in effect. If the 
daily balance is negative, we treat it as zero. 
DPR 
A DPR is I/365th of an APR. rounded to one ten-
thousandth of a percentage point. Your DPRs are 
shown in How Rates and Fees Work on page 2 of 
Part 1. 
EXAMPLE: Calculating Interest 
Assume that you have a single interest rate of 
15.99'%, your ADB is 52,250 and there are 30 
days in the biting period. 
The DPR is 15.99% * 365 days • 0.0438% 
Interest is 62.250 x 0.0438% x 30 days = 529.57 
Page S of 9 
Daily Balance 
For each day a DPR is in effect. we figure the daily 
balance by: 
• taking the beginning balance for the day. 
• adding any new charges, 
• subtracting any payments or credits; and 
• making any appropriate adjustments. 
We add a new charge to a daily balance as of its 
transaction date. 
Beginning balance 
For the first day of a billing period, the beginning 
balance is the ending balance for the prior billing 
period, including unpaid interest. For the rest of the 
billing penoct the beginning balance is the previous 
day's daily balance plus an amount of interest equal 
to the previous day's daily balance mukiphed by the 
DPR for that balance. This method of figuring the 
beginning balance results in dairy compounding of 
interest. 
When an interest rate changes, the new DPR may 
come into effect during—not just at the beginning 
of—the billing period. When this happens, we will 
create a new balance and apply the new DPR to it. 
To get the beginning balance on the first day for this 
new balance, we multiply the previous day's daily 
balance by the old DPR and add the result to that 
day's daily balance. 
Other methods 
To figure the ADB and interest charges, we may use 
other formulas or methods that produce equivalent 
results. Also, we may choose not to charge interest 
on certain types of charges.
