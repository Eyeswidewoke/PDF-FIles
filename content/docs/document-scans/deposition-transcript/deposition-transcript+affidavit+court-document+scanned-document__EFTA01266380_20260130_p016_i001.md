I. 
To register or not register such trust with the probate division of the 
Superior Court of the United States Virgin Islands or otherwise and to make all decisions which 
relate thereto; 
J. 
To give any Beneficiary of any trust hereunder a general power of 
appointment exercisable in such Beneficiary's Will over all or part of such trust, subject to any 
terms and conditions as my Trustees determine, by written notice to such Beneficiary; to 
eliminate any such power of appointment by written notice to the Beneficiary; and to irrevocably 
release the power under this paragraph to give a power of appointment or to eliminate a power of 
appointment; 
K. 
To renounce and disclaim, in whole or in part, and in accordance with 
applicable law, any assets, interests, rights, or powers (including any power of appointment) 
which are payable to (or exercisable by) such trust or over which my Trustees have any right, 
title, interest, or power; and 
L. 
To make, execute, and deliver any and all such instruments in writing as 
shall be necessary or proper to carry out any power, right, duty, or obligation of my Trustees or 
any disposition whatsoever of such trust or any asset of such trust and to exercise any and all

Section 6.5. - Restrictions on Exercise of My Trustee's Powers 
A. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a 
Trustee shall not participate in a discretionary decision to exercise or not exercise any fiduciary 
power to (1) distribute income from or principal of any trust hereunder to himself or herself; or

maintenance or education of a Beneficiary if such Trustee has a legal obligation to provide for 
the health, support, maintenance or education of such Beneficiary from such Trustee's personal 
assets. For purposes of this paragraph, a person whose interest in a trust hereunder is limited to a 
remote contingent interest (for example, a contingent remainderman whose interest depends 
upon another person failing to survive to a specified age or a person designated to receive assets 
only in the event a power of appointment is not exercised) shall not be treated as a person who is 
or may be a Beneficiary of such trust. 
B. 
A Trustee of any trust hereunder may by a written notice delivered to the 
other Trustee (or Trustees) of such trust decline to participate in the decision to exercise or not 
exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Agreement or by law. 
C. 
If a Trustee of any trust hereunder is not empowered (because of a conflict 
of interest, declination to act or otherwise) to participate in the decision to exercise or not 
exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Agreement or by law, then the remaining Trustee or 
Trustees of such trust shall be empowered to make such decision. If no Trustee or successor 
Trustee is empowered to participate in such decision, my Trustees may designate a substitute 
Trustee to serve as Trustee of such trust who shall be empowered to make such decision but has
