Re: 
Ok...tha='s helpful. You don't need to justify your decisions, it=E2 s clear to me you have enough good reasons. I only 
needed you to c=ose the door on our relationship and tell me you know what you'r= doing. Last time we spoke you were 
unable to say we were done - you sai= you didn't know. This was in October. But now it sounds like yo= finally do know 
what you want. I have no intentions of changing that so=- closed it is. Thank you, I'll start synthesizing. 
I do still need to sit=with you but we don't need to discuss this any further. There ar= obviously still practical issues that 
need to be addressed.

PS: We have been through a lot and I mean it when I say I am=0Ajust as embarrassed about my behavior as you are 
about putting up with i=. There was a lot of negativity I admit to causing, but let's no= make it more dramatic than what 
it was. My intentions were not =98devious'. I was a spoiled brat but there was no master plan to=take advantage of you 
or any "strategic and demonic" tacti= to exploit your love. My feelings for you were 100% genuine. There was =o 
strategy driving my uncooperative behavior, jealousy and selfish attem=ts to keep you all for myself. I can't justify any of 
that. But = hope you understand that my desire was not to get your money, lifestyle=or any other perks, but YOU and, 
yes, your attention. No more, no less. =/span>
