Armed Teens Who Broke Into Washington High School May Have Been Conducting 'Dry Run', FBI Now 
Involved 
KIRO (CBS-7) (06/02, Staff Writer) reported that the Enumclaw Police Department needs help identifying three 
people who broke into Enumclaw High School over the weekend. The department says the teens were masked and 
had at least one gun on them, but they didn't take anything or vandalize the school. On Monday afternoon, the 
Enumclaw police chief told the outlet they believe the visit may have been a dry run for a shooting. The FBI is now 
involved as police and federal agents continue to investigate. Chief Floyd said it's believed that one of the suspects 
who had their phone out was allegedly recording the whole thing, which is why investigators believe this was a 
rehearsal of some sort. Enumclaw High School will have increased police presence for the rest of the school year, or 
until the individuals can be identified and apprehended.
