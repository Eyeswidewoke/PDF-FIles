Sector Descriptions 
Ad Networks — Advertisers are shifting rapidly from traditional media over to online, video and mobile. 
In the first six months of 2010, they spent $627 million on video ads, up 31% from the same period in 
2009, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. Online and mobile advertising will continue to 
proliferate as more advertising dollars are spent on the web, and as new technologies are developed to 
deploy, target and track ads. We believe the investment opportunities in this sector are substantial. 
Content Related - User engagement via the mobile Internet will increasingly be driven by firms that 
succeed at making it easier to cope with the problem of exploding content (e.g. websites, services, Apps, 
commerce, etc.). Opportunities in this arena will be both horizontal and vertical. As mainstream users 
spend more time interacting with online media, monetization through advertising, direct marketing, 
subscriptions & commerce will create a $100 billion-plus marketplace over the next 5-10 years. Video 
content and related distribution platforms in particular present a wide range of opportunities. While 
legal downloading of video only started in 2008, PWC estimates that by 2014, 15% of all TV viewing will 
be Video on Demand. This will force media firms to develop new revenue models employing new 
technologies as content is delivered via broadband (wired and wireless), to TVs, computers and mobile 
devices. 
Event & Ticketing - The market for mobile ticketing transactions will double by 2012 to an estimated 
$100 billion worldwide, according to Juniper Research. The main drivers of this blistering growth are 
travel, entertainment and sporting events. We believe firms developing new technologies and business 
models in this sector can offer attractive returns for investors. 
General M&E —This sector represents investments in more traditional business models in the media and 
entertainment space. With our collective sector experience and expertise, we have superior access to 
the best new and existing media and entertainment companies. Our team members are immersed in 
the game-changing trends that are shaping the future of this still highly profitable sector. 
Mobile - The mobile Internet is poised to vastly expand user engagement through a wide range of new 
services. The breakout potential for new software applications & services is huge, especially in video 
entertainment, gaming, shopping, health care, travel, education & location-based social networking. 
Morgan Stanley predicts mobile Internet will grow to double the size of the desktop Internet in 6 years, 
with accelerating array of monetization opportunities. 
Payment Solutions — Almost overnight, digital goods have become a $16 billion-a-year business. The 
micropayment industry supporting this new form of commerce will grow substantially as media 
companies and traditional industries revamp their business models and mobile devices transform into 
digital wallets. In 2009, PayPal alone processed $2 billion in micropayment transactions. 
Social Media - The remarkable social media phenomenon continues to build, with estimated advertising 
revenues for the sector expected to reach $3.3 billion in 2010 — up 31% from just a year ago. Shares of 
Facebook trading on the secondary market indicate a company valuation of more than $30 billion. A
