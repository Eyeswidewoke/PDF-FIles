I am contributing to the briefing for incoming NY SAC and need to provide updates on any high profile cases being worked 
by the VSs. I'm thinking of the Maxwell/Epstein case for 
do you think this hate crimes case would be the 
most high profile for you right now? 
which case would you prefer I use for your AOR that would be high profile for 
a new SAC to learn about? 
Thanks for all your hard work.
