To the Honorable Patty Murray, 
Subject: Assistance and/or Resolution to a Hardship Transfer 
My name is Carol Montgomery. I am a constituent from your state currently working in 
the US Virgin Islands (USVI). I have worked for US Customs/Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) for the past 15 years. I started my federal career in Anchorage, AK, where I worked for 8 
years. I transferred to Salt Lake City, UT for 4 %z years and from there took a position and 
transferred to St Thomas, USVI where I agreed to work for 1 year minimum, after which I was 
asked to extend for one more year, which I did. I have completed the initial assignment time 
and gone beyond that for the needs of the service. 
I am currently in a situation of a personal nature, where I am having to care for two sick 
parents. As stated above, I am assigned to the Area Port of St. Thomas, USVI. In October of 
2009, I requested and was approved to take time off to vacation with my family. It was during 
this time (one week prior) that my father was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. This vacation 
may have turned out to be our family's last vacation together judging from the doctor's 
diagnosis that the cancer is terminal. It was at this time in October, that I requested a hardship 
transfer to help my mother with the care of my elderly father. Before I left St. Thomas, I was 
informed by management through Chief Murray David that the hardship transfer "should be 
approved" by the time I returned my leave was over; it was not. I was later informed that I 
needed to find my own position and If so, I would be released from current my duty station in 
St. Thomas, USVI. I went through the inquiry process a with the Seattle Office of Field 
Operation (Seattle OFO), and they assisted in finding a position within their area that is 40 
minutes from my parent's house in Stanwood at the port of Anacortes, Washington. This 
position was cleared and I was offered the position by Seattle Office of Field Operations' 
Mission Support Specialist, Jacquelyn Timme in February 2010. All that was need from the 
losing port (St. Thomas) was a release date so I could be added to the employee roles of the 
Seattle Office of Field Operations. The release would have to come form my current duty 
station St. Thomas, though the San Juan Office of Field Operations (San Juan OFO). Again, 
this did not happen. This was back in February 2010. Never did anyone from management in 
the Area Port of St. Thomas or San Juan OFO tell me why it (the hardship request) was not 
approved. I am not privy to any correspondence that was told to Seattle OFO (if any), but 
Seattle OFO went and held the position open until March 2010. Needing to fill the position, 
they (Seattle OFO) posted an opening for the Port of Anacortes, Washington, the same 
location I was offered back in February 2010. I applied for this same position again in March 
2010. This position was listed as a lateral position with no moving expenses or promotions. 
After I had applied for this position, the criteria was changed allowing for moving expenses and 
only open to those outside the USA. I was and currently am at my parent's home and would 
not need to move. I could be and I am ready to start work the next day, if allowed. I have no 
children so I will not be able to turn to my own children in my older age. I need to keep working 
and keep saving so I do not want to resign. 
I am just having a very hard time understanding why every time a request is made of me, I 
comply and another road block seems to be put in place or conjured up by either St. Thomas 
or San Juan OFO. I have tried to follow every protocol as outlined by CBP and NTEU-CBP 
booklet Your Guide to Your Workplace and done all that I have been asked to do, but nothing 
seems to satisfy whoever is denying my transfer request. I have complied in fulfilling all 
requests that have been made of me. In April of 2010, was forced into a position that I had to
