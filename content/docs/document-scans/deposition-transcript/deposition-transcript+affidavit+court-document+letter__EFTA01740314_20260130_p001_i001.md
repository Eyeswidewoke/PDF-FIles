Good evening Mr. Epstein, 
I was scheduled to go over today at 1:30 to take pictures, but Brice cancelled because of the rain 
and thunderstorms we were experiencing today. He did send out an email today to let you know. 
Brice has been cooperative in terms of getting me out to the island when pictures arc requested. 
Gary would accompany me or tell me the projects that I needed to take photos of, and of course 
if you gave a directive those photos were top priority, and then he would let me take the photos. 
Since Saturday, Brice has been the person directing me for the what projects are being worked on 
and so require photos. I was not happy with the photos I sent to you on Saturday, and neither 
were you - specifically the Blue beach photos because I did not take I) the number of photos you 
clearly requested and 2) because i took photos of the wrong areas of the beach. When I went out 
with Igala on Monday and told him your feedback on the Blue beach photos, he then explained in 
detail the areas of interest as well as what I should be looking for and reporting to you in those 
photos. 
Gary also did this when he took me to the different areas, or I followed your directives and 
feedback. Before Saturday, I was following the punch list in order, which i believed was 
somewhat working for you. It was very efficient for me in terms of having a checklist, I could use 
the list to follow up with Gary, Igala, Brice, etc. if work was done, and if photos, questions to 
you, etc. needed to be sent. i think what Marc has done with the punch list is ultimately going to 
be most beneficial for you and everyone involved in the punch list, but I still need Brice and Tom, 
who are orchestrating the daily work, to tell me what has the priority of the day, so I am not 
sending you work you have already reviewed and approved. A perfect example is your frustration 
regarding the main compound palms. I am trying to be more observant, so I apologize for not 
realizing that you had departed before all the palms presently in place were planted. But Brice did 
not realize that either until I asked him if you had seen the palms at the end of the pool, which you 
marked with his and Marc's bodies. 
Brice and Tom are concerned that the photos are at times giving you a wrong or incomplete 
perception of the particular projects, which I agree they do if I can not present to you the project 
and progress from as many angles as possible. You have always from January stated that the 
more photos you get the better. I always believed it was better to send you photos until you 
directly told me to stop taking photos of a particular project, or you take the project off the list. 
They requested to review the photos before i send them to you, which I have been doing since 
Saturday. So Brice has been directing the photos. i still wanted to take multiple photos of the 
projects he said were in progress, but he is not of the same mind. My fear is that Brice does not 
yet have a grasp on the projects that Gary does, and in limiting my photos, I am missing what you 
really want to see. 
What i do not want to continue to do is to waste your time and therefore your money, because
