"Sweetheart deal! = So goes the attack on the resolution of a long-ago federal 
=nvestigation involving our former client -- and now-friend -- Jeffrey =pstein. The attack is profoundly misplaced, 
supported neither by =he law or the facts, nor by the structure of our constitutional =epublic. To the contrary, Jeffrey 
was subjected to an aggressive =ederal intrusion into what would typically be considered a =uintessentially local criminal 
matter in south Florida. His =ffense — at its core, sexual favors for =ire — has long been treated as a matter entrusted 
to =aws of the several States, not the federal government. His =onduct — while clearly unlawful and for which he has 
=ccepted full responsibility — was a classic state =ffense and was being treated exactly that way by able, honest 
=rosecutors in Palm Beach County. Nevertheless, far from =oing "soft" on the matter and without =nvitation from the 
state, the federal government intervened. =ronically, now many for their own opportunistic reasons are criticizing =he 
federal decision-makers at the time, including now-Secretary of =abor Alex Acosta (then the United States Attorney in 
south Florida), =or not going far enough. 
The critics are wrong on the facts and the law. =nbsp; 
Here =re the true key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made =usinessman 
with no prior criminal history whatsoever (and who has never =cted as an informant), engaged in illegal conduct that 
amounts to =olicitation of prostitution. His conduct was wrong and a =iolation of Florida state law. Although no 
coercion, violence, =lcohol, drugs or the like were involved, some of the women he paid were =nder the age of 18. 
Those fads were carefully assessed by experienced =tate prosecutors who aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No 
=ne turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the public order. =o the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office 
conducted an =xtensive 15-month investigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes =ivision. Mr. Epstein was then 
indicted by a state grand jury on a =ingle felony count of solicitation of prostitution. =nbsp; 
During=that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered 
=nd analyzed the =vidence, met face-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered =heir credibility -- or lack 
thereof -- and considered the extent of =xculpatory evidence. After months of negotiations, the state =rosecutors 
believed they had reached a reasoned resolution of the =atter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely 
=onsistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated =efendants. The system worked as it should. =nbsp; 
Then, =n came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office extensively =nd 
aggressively investigated whether Mr. Epstein had engaged in a =ommercial human trafficking ring, targeting minors. 
But that'= not what this was, and the federal authorities ultimately =cknowledged that, deferring prosecution to the 
state. But not =ithout conditions. The federal prosecutors insisted on many =northodox requirements that Mr. 
Epstein's experienced defense =eam had never seen imposed on any defendant anywhere. =nbsp;Under the =ederally-
forced deal, Jeffrey was required to request that the =tate prosecutors demand the imposition of a jail sentence and
