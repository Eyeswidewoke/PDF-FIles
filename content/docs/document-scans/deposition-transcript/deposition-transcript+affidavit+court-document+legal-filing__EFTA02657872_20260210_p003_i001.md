My own view is different. To m= the proposal I suggested seems to be a very 
simple way of settling this m=tter, which to me is extremely troubling. I realize that this is jus= another case of a 
longstanding difference in the way we approach these pr=blems, a difference that has been clear ever since we were 
discussing the =nterest on the loan from the Trust and found that we could not communicate=because I mistakenly 
assumed that it was a discussion among family members=while your letters made it very clear and explicit that you saw 
it as a le=al issue to be settled among lawyers and Bainco, perhaps with a mediator i= the adversary proceeding. All 
matters I find it very hard to compre=end, and to live with, but so be it. 
So by all means consul= with your lawyer, or perhaps a battery of lawyers, to 
make sure that your=interests are properly protected. I don't need any lawyer's =dvice. The matter is perfectly clear 
and straightforward. So t=ere is no reason for me to hire a lawyer to deal with the question and to =ave a lawyer 
contact yours and initiate a discussion in which we all parti=ipate. 
The matter is very simple. We can proceed with=ut delay if you agree to settle 
the issue in the simple manner that I sugg=sted. 
As for your proposals in your letter of March 29, as = wrote you, the letter was 
so shocking that it was hard for me to bring my=elf to respond, but I did, in detail, but decided not to send it. Pe=haps I 
should. Will think about it. 
As for your propo=als, my response was the obvious one. I'm sorry for the 
stress y=u had to endure, but your efforts were a waste of time for reasons I had a=ready fully explained before you 
undertook them. As I'm sure you=recall, a few years ago, I requested tax payments from the marital trust w=en my IRA 
was being rapidly depleted by my advisers who were distributing =alf to family and using the other half to pay 
management fees and taxes fo= the entire estate, so that to pay Alex's medical expenses and the exp=nses for Wellfleet 
I had to withdraw excess funds with exorbitant taxes, a=l that before withdrawing even a cent to live on again with 
exorbitant tax=s. Your response was to refuse the request unless I agreed to intrus=ve and insulting financial 
investigations -- of a kind I never considered =hen providing funds to you for something you needed. I made it clear=and 
explicit at the time that I would not submit to this procedure. =ince your efforts and proposals simply repeat the same 
procedure, they wer= a waste of time. 
There were some things in your letter tha= were correct. You're right that 
despite what has happened, I L-=;m still a "wealthy man," with income well above the median, tho=gh lacking a pension 
and accumulated property, not at the level of my peer=. Furthermore, I can supplement my income by teaching large 
undergra=uate courses, something I'd never done and that is not that common for=people approaching 90, but 
something that I enjoy. And you too are a=wealthy man, for the same reasons: the reasons are that I've worked ha=d all 
my life, lived fairly simply (and live even more simply today), and =as therefore able to put aside enough money to 
ensure that my children and=grandchildren are very well cared for, indefinitely. 
=/div> 
But I again suggest that we put all of this aside, and deal quickly a=d simply with 
what appears to be the one outstanding issue: dividing the M=rital trust and then dissolving it, all very simple, needing 
no lawyers, a= least on my part.
