126 Part III: The Art of Giving Massage  
st,SE Tke. 
Touching Jos6 
(While volunteering at the University of Miami 
Medical Center AIDS ward, I discovered that 
you can create a caring compassionate "mas-
sage mood" anywhere, even in a sterile 
hospital room. This is the story of Jose, whom I 
met there.) 
On the -bright Christmas Eve morning that we 
entered 'his room, Jose's body was wracked 
with pain, and he was curled. into a fetal posi-
tion on his hospital bed. His family stood at the 
foot of the bed arranged like a choir — mother, 
father, aunts, uncles, siblings, and friends. All of 
-them-with their hands at their sides, standing 
several feet.away. 
Jackson Memorial Hospital did not employ Rob 
Boyte, a nurse, and me, a massage therapist 
We were volunteers with the PALMS. founda-
tion, and we were there to touch Jose. 
You see, nobody else would touch Jose 
because these were the early days of AIDS and 
everyone was still afraid, even the doctors and 
the other nurses. Even the family members of 
the victims were afraid. Everyone kept his 
distance. 
Jose had received a spinal tap the night before. 
Convulsions ran through his body, up to his head 
and back down. He could only speak in broken, 
grunted syllables. His family translated for us. 
"He says he wants the massage," said one 
relative. 
"He thinks it would feel good," said another. "Go 
ahead, try." 
We approached the bed. Both of us stood on the 
same side, facing Jose's exposed back. Rob 
gently placed one large hand on the back of 
Jose's neck, not moving it at all. I touched him, 
too. Jose didn't relax into the touch; he couldn't 
because of the convulsions. He moaned, but not 
with-pleasure either like many massage Clients 
do. Instead, he moaned with something deeper, 
almost like pain itself, and I knew immediately 
what it was. All of the family members knew 
what it was, too. 
Jose was letting out the primal moan of some-
one who had not been touched for a long time, 
atthe point in his life when he most desperately 
needed to be touched. 
Subtly, Jose pressed his back up into my hands. 
I watched the family members lean forward, lift-
ing their hands slightly, as if they too were 
touching Jose, although they-were too terrified 
to do so themselves. 
Slowly, I stroked down Jose's back, then back 
up again. His skin was cold, then hot in turns. 
The family members stared hard at our hands. 
We were not wearing rubber gloves because 
we knew AIDS was not transmitted by skin-to-
skin contact. Everyone should have known it, 
but they didn't. 
Slowly, Jose responded. His convulsions sub-
sided. He became quiet. For a few minutes, 
everyone there could see that he was all 
wrapped up in the sensation of two other 
humans, four other hands, touching him, sooth-
ing him, being with him in the way that only 
CONTACT can provide. 
Then it was time to go. The ward was filled with 
other patients on that Christmas Eve day. Rob 
and I moved to the sink where we washed our 
hands with red disinfectant soap. We smiled at 
the family, and they smiled back at the two 
strangers who had just shared such an intimate 
moment. 
We left the room and moved on. Then, a few 
minutes later, we heard a gasp, a cry, then a 
high female wail come echoing down the white
