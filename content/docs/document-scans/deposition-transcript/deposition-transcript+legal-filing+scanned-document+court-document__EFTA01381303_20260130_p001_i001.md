Our ingredients typically account for more than half of our cost of sales and primarily include animal proteins, whole grains, vegetables 
and vitamin and mineral supplements. Animal proteins (such as chicken, lamb and fish). in the form of whole meats and meat meals, make up 
almost half of ingredient spending. We have increased the percentage of ingredients contracted for our dry foods from approximately 30% of our 
forward twelve-month needs in 2009 to approximately 90% in 2014. We enter into contracts relating to the physical purchase of the majority of our 
main ingredients, including our meats and meals, grains, fruit, vegetables, starches and fibers. These contracts are focused primarily on ensuring 
availability, quality and price predictability. Depending on the nature of the ingredients. some contracts arc fixed in price while others have a 
variable component based on a pricing formula. For example, contracts for the purchase of poultry meals usually have a price adjustment 
component that follows fluctuations of soybean meal futures, but other terms, such as quantity, delivery and length of contract arc fixed and 
negotiated with the particular suppliers. The length of the contracts is fixed for a period of time, typically up to a year or for a season and/or a crop 
year. These contracts often have minimum purchase requirements and are typically renewed annually. In 2015, under our Commodity Price Risk 
Management Policy, we expect to contract approximately 90% of ow ingredients. In addition, we may enter into fixed price and/or fixed quantity 
contracts for a pre-determined amount of our ingredients to reduce short term price volatility in certain commodities. Although we do not currently 
engage in hedging activities, we expect to adopt certain hedging strategies in the future consistent with our Commodity Price Risk Management 
Policy. Historically, we have been able to pass along commodity cost increases to our customers in the form of increased prices. Over an I8-month 
period between the summer of 2011 and early 2013. we implemented three price increases while continuing to grow our volumes. 
Packaging materials for wet products and treats arc provided by our contract manufacturers and we pay for packaging as pan of the. unit 
price of the finished products. For our dry foods, our procurement team sources and purchases the packaging materials dinstly from suppliers. We 
then sell the packaging materials to our contract manufacturers as needed for production. The per unit amount paid by the contract manufacturer. 
plus an amount for allowable yield loss, is then charged back to us by the manufacturer as a component of the finished product charges. This 
arrangement puts the burden of excessive yield loss on our contract manufacturer and provides them with an incentive to reduce/eliminate 
packaging waste. 
We believe that our supplier relationships and procurement planning will he able to support ow potential capacity needs for the 
foreseeable future. 
Quality Control 
We believe that food safety and quality are paramount. We have developed, implemented and enforced a robust food safety and quality 
program. 
We have established critical control points throughout the entire supply chain from ingredient sourcing to finished goods to ensure 
compliance with our quality program. All of our contract and owned manufacturing facilities are required to have a hazard analysis critical control 
points plan that identifies critical pathways for contaminants and mandates control masons that must be used to prevent, eliminate or reduce 
relevant food-borne hazards. This includes, among other things, proper kill steps, product flow, air balance control, proper cleaning of athipment 
and affirmative release of finished goods. We require our contract and owned manufacturing facilities to maintain third-party certifications and pass 
our own quality system and food safety audits and GMPs. The third party certifications provide an independent and external validation that a 
product and/or process complies with applicable food safety regulations and standards. In addition, our quality control team conducts both 
scheduled and unannounced audits of all aspects of our supply chain to ensure that ingredients, finished goods and manufacturing processes meet 
our strict food safety and quality requirements. 
We ensure that all of our ingredients are rigorously tested prior to being approved for use in our products. Testing certifications, 
certificate of origin and certificate of analysis, which confirm that the ingredient mats our specifications as to quality and safety. must accompany 
or be on file for every shipment. In addition,
