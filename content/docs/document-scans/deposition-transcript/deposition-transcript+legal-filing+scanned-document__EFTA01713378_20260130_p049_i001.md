At the same time that Linda and her father swapped sex toys, her relationship with Schutt 
continued to deepen. 
McMahan wasn't thrilled: "I know you like him. Even though I am truly jealous, I am hardly in 
position to interfere or even realty want to interfere with that part of your life. Don't lock him out 
if he is important to you. Kisses everywhere," he wrote in an e-mail dated August 15, 1998. 
That winter, Linda and Schutt became engaged. But the sexual relationship with her father didn't 
stop. She continued to sleep with her father through the end of summer 1999 and "up until" her 
October wedding to Schutt, she testified. Then, with the ceremony approaching, Linda ended the 
sex with her dad. 
"I was in love with my fiancé... I was deeply disturbed with the relationship with my father? 
McMahan, she said, reacted with "anger, withdrawal, paranoia." 
He asked her what she wanted, what her "perfect life" would be. 
"I told him that I would like to live in Sausalito, California. I would like to have a Saab convertible. 
I would like to have a dog named Pooh, and a sailboat? 
She testified that her father answered that he could give her all of those things and financial 
security for life. But Schutt, he told her, probably couldn't provide that kind of life. 
The argument didn't persuade her. Linda and Schutt married on October 2, 1999, in Sonoma. 
During the event, McMahan gave the couple a toast. 
"He made an attempt to quote Winston Churchill... He told all the guests during his toast at my 
wedding that, This is the beginning of the end. 
McMahan was no doubt cribbing from Churchill's line from a speech he gave in 1942 at a turning 
point in WWII: "This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the 
end of the beginning." 
Linda said that McMahan never explained what he meant by it. 
McMahan moved on, starting a new romance with a Ukrainian woman who eventually became his 
fifth wife. And he did provide his daughter employment. He named Linda president and CEO of 
McMahan Center for Human Abilities, a nonprofit foundation McMahan had created to extend the 
efforts of his primary charity, the National Cristina Foundation, which provides computers to 
disabled children and is named after another of his daughters, who has cerebral palsy. Linda was 
being paid $10,000 a month to run the foundation in the spring of 2002 when family members 
gathered to have dinner in a Sonoma restaurant. 
Linda testified that she was asked in front of the others when she and Schutt planned to have 
children. "Soon," she replied. 
The next day, McMahan asked to meet her in the lobby of a hotel. When she arrived, carrying 
paperwork for the McMahan Center, she began to speak witnim about ideas for the foundation. 
But he became enraged. 
"His face became red. He clenched his fists, and he raised his voice... He told me that having 
children was not part of the plan." 
McMahan told her he was ending the foundation and no longer planned to pay her. (He did cut her 
off, but the foundation still exists.) 
"He told me that I was not able to have children and be committed to the project," she testified. 
She returned to her career in psychology and accepted a post-doctoral fellowship at the University
