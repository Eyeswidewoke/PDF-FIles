After=Greensboro, McCain went on to graduate from N.C. A&T with degrees in chemistry and biology. A year later, he 
married =ettye Davis, a Bennett College student who also had participated in the civil rights demonstrations. She died

activist for civil rights." "His presence is going to be missed," Ferguson said, "but his legacy will live on." Gov. Pat 
McCrory said McCain "made his mark on American history in 1960 with a simple act of extraordinary courage."

statement. "His death follows a life of service to his community and is a true loss for our state." In 201., McCain 
reflected on his moment in history. "That day — Feb. 1, 1960— was the best day of my life, and just for sitting on some
