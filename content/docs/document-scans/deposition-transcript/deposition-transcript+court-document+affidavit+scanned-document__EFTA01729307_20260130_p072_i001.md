recover the folder or journal in which he kept the notes that were 
given to him during his employ with Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. He kept this

to justify what occurred with the monies he had to keep or any 
questions as to the petty cash he withdrew from the household account 
from the bank. At approximately 10:00 pm, I attempted contact with
