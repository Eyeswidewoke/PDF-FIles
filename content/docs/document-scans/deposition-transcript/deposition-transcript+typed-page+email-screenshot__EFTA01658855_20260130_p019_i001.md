emergency authorization." Azar is quoted as saying, "So we could be seeing both of these 
vaccines out and getting into people's arms before Christmas." 
Azar said on Fox News' America's Newsroom (11/30, 896K), "I wish we had 330 million 
doses on day one upon approval. But even with the incredible work of President Trump and 
Operation Warp Speed and starting manufacturing in the early days of these programs, we're 
going to have maybe 40 million doses of vaccine by the end of this year. ... So, we want to 
make sure those first vaccines, the first weeks, go to those most vulnerable, those where you 
will have the biggest impact on saving lives, and also protecting those most at risk like our 
front line healthcare workers taking care of COVID patients." 
Operation Warp Speed scientific head Moncef Slaoui said on Fox Business' Mornings With 
Maria (11/30), "I'm very concerned. Clearly, the spike and the surge is happening and as has 
been said, we're probably are going to experience another surge on top of the current surge. ... 
I think the size of the surge is such that we are not able to produce as quickly as much 
treatment as needed. The vaccines I hope will be approved next week. ... However, I'd like to 
say while we've done tremendous work to make these vaccines available, we only have enough 
vaccines to immunize 20 million people in the month of December." Slaoui was also interviewed 
on Fox News' Special Report (11/30, 1.53M). 
Director of Supply, Production, and Distribution for Operation Warp Speed Paul Ostrowski 
was asked on MSNBCVi (11/30, 1.54M) when a "regular, ordinary American" can expect to 
receive a vaccine. Ostrowski said, "I would tell you that the bottom line is on that is that right 
after the first part of the second quarter. So start thinking about the April or May timeframe, we 
will have the massive amount of vaccines necessary in order to ensure the rest of America is 
covered down." 
Administration Reportedly Leaving It To States To Determine Vaccine 
Distribution. Politico (11/30, Owermohle, Roubein, Brennan, 4.29M) reports that the Trump 
Administration is "shunting to the states hard decisions about which Americans will get the 
limited early supplies of coronavirus vaccines - setting up a confusing patchwork of distribution 
plans that could create unequal access." According to Politico, "Federal and state officials agree 
that the nation's 21 million health care workers should be first in line. But there is no consensus 
about how to balance the needs of other high-risk groups, including the 53 million adults aged 
65 or older, 87 million essential workers and more than 100 million people with medical 
conditions that increase their vulnerability to the virus." Politico says the Administration "has 
told states that they have ultimate authority for determining who gets vaccinated first," and 
"has also decided to allocate scarce early doses based on states' total populations, forcing hard 
choices in states with a greater proportion of residents at high risk." 
The New York Times (11/30, Grady, Zraick, 18.61M) reports that on Monday, when "asked 
about the role of states in the distribution process," Azar "said that doses would be shipped out 
through normal vaccine distribution systems, and governors would be `like air traffic controllers' 
determining which hospitals or pharmacies receive shipments. While governors will determine 
which groups are prioritized, he said he hoped that they would follow the federal 
recommendations." Azar is quoted as saying, "Be thinking people in nursing homes, the most 
vulnerable, be thinking health care workers who are on the front lines." 
First Shipments Of Pfizer's Vaccine Have Arrived In Michigan. In the lead ABC 
World News TonightVi (11/30, 6:32 p.m. ET, story 1, Muir, 7.69M) story, Steve Osunsami said 
ABC "has confirmed that the first shipments of the Pfizer vaccine for the coronavirus have 
traveled by air from production in Belgium to a storage facility in Michigan, so that the minute 
the US government says it's okay for emergency use, those first shots will be ready to rush 
across this country." According to Osunsami, United Airlines "is flying the vaccine on chartered 
cargo flights." 
CNBC (11/30, Josephs, Lovelace, 3.62M) reports on its website that the Federal Aviation 
Administration "said it supported the `first mass air shipment' of Covid-19 vaccines on Friday, as 
pharmaceutical companies and airlines prepare networks for broad distribution." Sources told
