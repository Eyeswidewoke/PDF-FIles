<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">In this way, the ax=s of resistance was transformed into an axis 
of Iranian-Shia power, extend=ng from Tehran to Nouri al-Maliki's government in Iraq and Hezbollah in Le=anon — a 
resilient axis united by support 
for the Assad regime.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">After Morsi's elect=on, Turkey and Qatar lent Egypt financial and 
political support, forming a=new strategic alliance. Thus the coup that overthrew Morsi in July was a s=rategic 
earthquake. But it was welcomed 
by what was left of the axis of moderation: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and=lordan. The Saudi king congratulated the 
interim president of Egypt and, w=th Kuwait and the UAE, offered him a package of aid exceeding $12bn, and K=ng 
Abdullah II of Jordan was the 
first Arab leader to visit Cairo after the coup. However, Qatar and Turkey=condemned the coup. Iran, though not sorry 
to see Morsi go given his suppo=t for the Syrian revolution, was concerned to see Egypt strongly aligned o=ce more with 
Iran's enemies.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">The aftershocks of =he coup continue to affect the region. The 
countries supporting it had hop=d the military would enforce its rule in a matter of weeks, but they misca=culated: three 
months on the Egyptian 
scene hasn't settled down. There are still constant marches and protests, =s well as an imposed evening curfew. Military 
and security measures have b=en taken against the Sinai and several cities and villages opposing the co=p, and are 
driving the country 
into a state of economic paralysis.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">On a regional level= there were other miscalculations, too. The 
new axis of moderation tried t= topple the Islamist movements in Tunisia and Libya, while the Egyptian ar=y began 
destroying the tunnels linking 
Gaza and Sinai as well as launching an extensive campaign against Hamas wi=h the hope of ending its control of the 
Gaza Strip. At the same time, the =ew axis of moderation also strained its relationship with Turkey, one of t=e most 
strategically important 
countries in the region.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">However, the greate=t miscalculation the new axis made was its 
evaluation of the Russian and A=erican position on Syria. This axis hoped Basher al-Assad's regime would b= quickly 
eliminated and replaced with 
a regime aligned with the axis of moderation, while also excluding jihadis=s from the scene. Saudi and UAE diplomacy 
supported an American military s=rike against Assad. They communicated with Russia to give assurances and i=centives 
to ensure that the Russians 
would refrain from effective rejection of any strikes. However, the Russia=-American deal to disarm Syria's chemical 
weapons was a surprise. This was=then followed by the developing

style="f=nt-size:18.Opt">, which further complicated 
the situation and derailed the aims of the axis of moderation.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">The restructuring o= regional alliances is still ongoing. The two 
countries that would benefit=most from being politically close would be Turkey and Iran. Iran, burdened=by an

and Syrian crises being resolved in a manner that would guarantee the pres=rvation of its power while bringing stability 
to the region.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Meanwhile, Turkey a=so has an interest in putting an end to the 
bloodshed in Syria and Iraq be=ause of the detrimental impact the conflicts are having on Turkey's own st=bility and 
economic development. In
