RE: 
I never said I could, after you had ma=e up your mind, "tell you the truth." I had and have no kno=ledge of the truth 
(and I'm not saying that in some high philosophical sense). 
nick sent me projections, at least ten within twenty days and all based on different scenarios of where it would be shot 
and how many days after he played shrinko with the script, and dependi=g on who took what payments and in what 
waterfall order they were to be repaid and all of his projections made money though most inevitably we=e uncertain as 
they depended on events that were then futural like shooting i= gramercy park or the arts club and getting Pacino or the 
casting director to accept a lower fee or cutting the days to 28 or shooting in Louisiana or getting hig= Louisiana rebates, 
etc. There couldn't have been a truth and there couldn=#82173 even have been an estimate of it, nor can there be 
now. </=pan> 
I may have said "discuss it with=you" or maybe I said it jocularly. There is no truth in predictions of the=future. I was 
interested to get your perceptions as nick had told me that you had a=ked specialists in the field to advise you. I had no 
such experts and I n=ver would have presumed to know what would become of it. I still don't. <=:p> 
Nor did I have "intimate knowledge. Nick spent fourteen hours a day on it taking to projection=creators, possible 
finance sources, and intended acting or production participants, &=bsp;and I got a ten to twenty minute glimpse of a 
status once a day while he was in=New York and less yet while he was in la. I advised on how to deal with b=rg and 
other blackmailers, not on the finance. =/p> 
Add to all this that I was never asked=to opine on it. As it had started all around me, and I was puzzled as to=how you 
had come to an interest and nick told me that it was at your instance, = had no reason to intrude myself in rendering an 
unasked opinion. Had I be=n asked to do so I would surely have said what I do herein, namely, that I am=not in the field, 
have no experience in the vicissitudes of film equity investm=nts, and would if I were to put money into it myself not be 
doing so in prospect=of profit but rather in ambivalent solidarity with my son (ambivalent because = know how 
inconstant a source of satisfaction the business is).=/font> 
Add to this that I have no aspirations=or pretensions that I know public taste. What I like, the public doesn't, typically 
and vice versa. I had looked forward to your views as you or your=advisors would have had a sense of whether it would 
appeal to people after the Wall Street- and madoff-bashing time. and I saw Pacino do a reading of it in whi=h he seemed 
involved and I knew Pacino liked nick: I saw them together =n two occasions and saw the email exchanges between 
them which underlined it and =aw the non-money (though always complaining that he hadn't yet had a firm pay =r play 
commitment by nick's financier ohoven) exchanges with berg.=/o:p>
