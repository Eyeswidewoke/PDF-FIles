As a result of our conference call you requested that we consolidate a list=of technical questions and information that 
we will need in the near term =o proceed with the design and construction of this project. 
1. WE need to know what governmental authority ( if any) has jurisdiction =ver any construction on the island. I know 
this is a private island but t=e fact that it is part of the US Virgin Islands means there will be some s=rt governmental 
oversite however slight that might be. Since he has alread= built some structures on the island he should be very familiar 
with any j=risdictional requirements. WE just need to know what they are. 
2. We will eventually need a topographic survey of the site to be built upo=. The sooner we get that the better. It will 
define such things as: 
a. high and low tide levels 
b. any setback restrictions from mean sea level trace 
c. Any maritime easements 
d Topography of the site 
e. Storm surge setbacks 
f. STorm surge elevations 
3. We may not need it immediately but eventually we will need to know how t= design the foundations. Since this is an 
island and we will be within the=beach zone we would automatically assume we are primarily sand. The depth= 
condition and bearing capacity of the sand or the underlying rock will ne=d to be identified so we know how to design 
the foundations. Since he has =lready built on the island he may already have a good idea of what to expe=t once we 
start digging on the beach.His architect or contractor who did t=e work so far on the island certainly would know. This 
could be as simple =s just having him give us the name of the architect and /or contrator he w=rked with there and we 
could get a lot of our questions answered just by t=lking to them directly. Other questions for the local guys there. 
a.Short cycle logistics providers to the island 
b. Looks like a M&R facility of some sort on island. What equipment if any=is already on the island 
and can 
be used. ( cranes, forklifts, trucks to =o from landing area to the site,...etc.) 
c. Subsurface soil conditions 
4. Is their an existing Pier? If so, depth and load ratings alongside exist=ng pier. 
5. If no pier the we would use LCU (Landing Craft Barge) Please pinpoint =n Chart which is most appropriate Beach for 
LCU and associated road access=from landing point to site.
