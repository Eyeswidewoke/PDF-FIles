"Material Corrosion" means any corrosion that (A) cannot be repaired, rectified 
and terminated on a non-recurring basis such that the Aircraft can be returned to service 
without a requirement of repetitive or recurring inspections which deviate from the 
Aircraft manufacturer's normal maintenance procedures or requires modifications to the 
normal component life limitations, overhaul and/or inspection intervals for the Aircraft; 
(B) is materially dissimilar when compared to the same type of aircraft of similar age and 
total time since new; or (C) exceeds manufacturer's published tolerances for corrosion to 
a significant degree.
