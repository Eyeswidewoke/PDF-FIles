It has always seemed to me that there are just some people out there w=o possess perfect jeans-bodies—lower 
hemispheres that somehow alway= look their best in the jeans you always want but can never seem to find, w=ether 
that's flared or ultra-high or ultra-low or cropped or mid-ri=e or vintage Levi's 5015 (not "new," exactly, but y=u'd be 
forgiven for thinking so considering how many people have su=denly begun sporting them)—and I was just not ever 
going to be one o= those people. Don't get me wrong, I had my handful of silhouettes d=wn: a small stable of brands 
and styles that worked, but that was it—=ot unlucky in denim love, exactly, but aware of my limitations, every chang=ng 
room experience a battlefield strewn with pairs of ill-fitting, unflatte=ing, totally depressing denim that often left me 
uninspired, empty-handed, a=d endlessly covetous of the ideal-fitting jeans that seemed utterly beyond m= grasp. 
Re/Done chttp://shopredone.com/pages/discover-your-perfect-pair>'s denim came close, but no two pairs=fit alike, 
which, when you find a pair that fits perfectly, is something of=an anticlimax. Like a series of really great dates with a 
guy who's=leaving the country in a month, it feels like more of a tease than anything= I'm in it for the long-term.

And then a colleague took pity on me. Vogue, you see, is perhaps unsurprisingly full o= these perfect-jeans-wearers, and 
rather than a specific brand or site or s=ore, the universal explanation all came down to one idea: tailoring. Oh, co=e on, 
I'd say, you really tailo= your jeans? Who has the time? Who want= to spend the money? Well, my friends, i= turns out I 
have enough of the former to investigate. And what I found may=shock you: No one, actually, has a perfect jeans-body. 
We are all jeans-bodies: We just need to help our jeans alon=. Which is where tailoring comes in. Here, your guide to 
finding your ideal=pair—chances are that they've been in your closet all along= 
Here's what you need to know. 
1. Proportion is key. Be aware of pockets and z=ppers; neither will be moved without a fight. Beware of too-long zippers 
(o=ten on men's vintage styles picked up at the flea market) or too-bi=, unflatteringly placed pockets: If these are 
relocated, the denim undernea=h will be a different color.

2. This feels obvious, but isn't: Jean= that are too big are easier to fix than jeans that are too small. It4e=99s always 
easier for a tailor to take things a size smaller than the oppos=te. (Though denim panels can be added to give you some 
additional wiggle ro=m, it's not ideal.) You want the jeans to fit comfortably over your=largest body part (thigh, waist, 
hip)— everything else can be taken=in to your liking. 
3. Be honest with yourself. Some things will n=ver be what you want them to be. Admit defeat and open your mind to 
other p=ssibilities—we are almost in cut-off season, after all! 
4. Shockingly easy (and really quite inexpensi=e) fixes: Do your jeans fit well, other than that waistband gap? That4>=99s 
the easiest adjustment of all. Crave the new crop <http://www.vogue.com/85=5393/cropped-pant-trend-spring-
2015/?intcid=inline_amp> ? Have those suckers hemmed. Inner thighs worn through o= your skinnies? They're an inset 
panel away from a totally restruct=red (and stronger for it!) pair. The options are, if not endless, surprisin=ly varied. 
5. Really, everyone looks better when their cl=thes are tailored. "It's addictive," says tailor Erin Hogan-Braker. "Once 
y=ur clothes fit really well, you never look back."
