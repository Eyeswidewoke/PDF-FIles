pursuant to the Perire policy. 
We reiterate that this case was at heart a local matter that was being fully addressed by 
the state criminal justice system. The state process resulted in an appropriate resolution of this 
matter and would have vindicated any conceivable federal Interest. 
Thus, there was no. 
substantial federal interest that justified a federal prosecution. It has recently come to our 
attention that that the CROS chief stutements may be relevant to this mutter. While we welcome 
the opportunity to consider these statements. our extensive research had found only one federal 
action that was remotely sitnilar to the federal investigation for the prosecution of this matter. 
and that ease has since been distinguished as well. 
B. 
Ms. 
Prompted An Unduh• Invasive lInvestiention Of Mr. Epstein. 
Ms. 
s investigation of Mr. Lipstein raises serious questions. Despite the fact 
that she was mac aware of the inaccuracies in the P131'lis Probable Cause Affidavit, she chose 
to include t 
via in a document Ma) with the court knowing that the public could access it. 
Then. Ms. 
issued letters requesting documents whose subject matter have no relation to 
the allegations against Mr. ISpstein. Notably. affix we objected to these overt 
broad and 
intrusive requests. Deputy Chief Andrew Laurie denied knowledge of Ms. 
s actions 
and Mr Laurie commendably so 
t 
igni tiara ly narrow the list of documen requested. In 
a subsequent court filing, Ms. 
referred to our agreement to remove these items from 
her demand list as evidence of r. .pstein's -non-cooperation". 
'Ibis was only the beginning. Ms. 
also subpoenaed an agent of Roy Black 
(without following the guidelines provided in tc nited States Attorney's Manual that require 
prior notification to Washington necessary to seek a I• t 
'cords). We once more requested 
Mr. Louric to intervene. Despite these efforts. Ms. 
followed up with a subpoena fur 
Mr. linetein's confidential medical records served direct y on his chiropractor (with no notice to 
Mr. Epstein). Ms. 
also made the unusual request of asking the State Attorney's Office 
for some of the grand jury materials. She threatened to subpoena the State when she was 
informed that it was a violation of Florida law to reltxtse this information. 
After compiling this "evidence-. Ms. 
stated she would he initiating no 
investigation into per n violations of IS U.S. . § 
(again without the required prior DUI 
notification). 
Ms. 
then broadened the scope of the investigation without any 
foundation for doing so y adding charges of money laundering and violations of a money 
transmitting business to the investigation. Mr. F.pgein's counsel explained that there could be no 
basis for these charges since Mr. Epstein did not commit any prerequisite act for a money 
laundering charge and has never even been engaged in a money transmitting business. Ms. 
responded that Mr. Epstein could he charged under these statutes because he funded
