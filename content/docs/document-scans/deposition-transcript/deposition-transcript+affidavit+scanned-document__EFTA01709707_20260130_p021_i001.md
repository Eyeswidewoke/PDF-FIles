EXPLANATION OF YOUR 
ASVAB STANDARD SCORES 
Your ASVAB results are reported as standard scores 
in the above graph. Your score on each test is 
identified by the "X" in the corresponding bar 
graph. You should view these scores as esti:micro( 
your true skill level in that area. If you took the test 
again, you probably would receive a somewhat 
different score. Many things, such as how you were 
feeling during testing, contribute to this difference. 
This difference is shown with gray score bands in 
the graph of your results. Your standard scores are 
based on the ASVAB tests and composites based on 
your grade level. 
The score bands provide a way to identify some of 
your strengths. -Overlapping score bands mean 
your true skill level is similar in both areas, so the 
real difference between specific scoresmightnot be 
meaningfullf the score bands do not overlap, you 
probably are stronger in the area that has the higher 
score band. 
YOUR ASVAB PERCENTILE SCORES 
Your ASVAB results are reported as percentile 
scores in the three columns to the right of the graph. 
Percentile scores show how you compare to other 
students- males and females, and for all students - 
in your grade. For example, a percentile score of 65 
for an 11th grade female would mean she scored 
the same or better than 65 out of every 100 females 
in the 11th grade. 
For purposes of career planning, knowing your 
relative standing in these comparison groups is 
important. Being male or female does not limit 
your career or educational choices. There are 
noticeable differences in how men and women 
score in some areas. Viewing your scores in light 
of your relative standing both to men and women 
may encourage you to explore areas that you 
might otherwise overlook. 
You can use the Career Exploration Scores to 
evaluate your knowledge and skills in three ggeeen- 
eral areas (Verbal, Math, and Science and Techni-
cal Skills). You can use the ASVAB Test Scores to 
gather information on specific skill areas. To-
gether, these scores provide a snapshot of your 
current knowledge and skills. This information 
will help you develop and review your career 
goals and plans. 
The ASVAB is an aptitude test. It is neither an 
absolute measure of_your skills and abilities nor a 
perfect predictor of your success or failure. A 
high score does not guarantee success, and a low 
score does not guarantee failure, in a future edu-
cational program or occupation. For example, if 
you have never worked with shop equipment or 
cars, you may not be familiar with the terms and 
concepts assessed by the Auto and Shop Informa-
lion test. Taking a course or obtaining a part-
timejobin thisareawouldincreaseyour knowl-
edge and improve your score if you were to 
take it again. 
USING ASVAB RESULTS IN 
CAREER EXPLORATION 
Your career and educational plans may change 
over time as you gain more experience and 
learn more about your interests. Exploring Ca-
reers: The ASVAB Career aplonftion Guide 
can help you learn more about yourself and the 
world of work, to identify and explore potential 
goals, and develop an effective strategy to real-
ize your goals. The Guide will help you identify 
occupations in line with your interests and 
skills. As you explore potentially satisfying 
careers,you will develop your career explora-
tion and planning skills. 
Meanwhile, your ASVAB results can help go: 
in making well-informed choices about hi 
high school courses. 
We encourage you to discuss your ASVAB 
results with a teacher, counselor, parent, family 
member or other interested adult. These indi-
viduals can hap you to view your ASVAB 
results in light of other important information, 
such as your interests, school grades, motiva-
tion, and personal goals. 
MILITARY CAREERS 
AND 
ENTRANCE SCORES 
Two more scores can be especially use-
ful to you. The Military Careers Score is 
a composite of the ASVAB verbal, math, 
mechanical, and electronics tests. The 
Military Careers Score provides a link 
to occupations described in Military 
Careen. You will be able to see how well 
your skills, abilities, and career interests 
match those of Service personnel cur-
rently working in military occupations. 
lvlilitaly Careers provides you with a 
clear image of what workers do in these 
occupations, as well as other useful in-
formation about the occupations. 
The Military Entrance Score (also called 
AFQT, which stands for the Armed 
Forces Qualification Test) is the score 
used to determine your qualifications 
for entry into any branch of the United 
States Armed Forces or the Coast Guard. 
The Military Entrance Score predicts in 
a general way how well you might do in 
training and on the job in military occu-
pations. Your score reflects your stand-
mg compared to American men and 
women 18 to 23 years of age. 
USE OF INFORMATION 
Personal identity information (name, so-
cial security number, street address, and 
telephone number) and test scores will 
not be released to any agency outside of 
the Department of Defense (DoD), the 
Armed Forces, the Coast Guard, and 
your school. Your school or local school 
system can determine any further re-
lease of information. The DoD will use 
your scores for recruiting and research 
purposes for up to two years. After that 
the information will be used by the DoD 
for research purposes only.
