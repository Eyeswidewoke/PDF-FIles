False Positive passengers will not be allowed to board a flight unless they can differentiate themselves from the actual 
person on t=e list, usually by presenting ID showing their middle name or date of birth.=C24:0 In some cases, False 
Positive passengers have been denied boarding or have mis=ed flights because they could not easily prove that they 
were not the person o= the No Fly List. But what if you don't know that your name is on the list? And if it is, how do you 
get your name off this list, if indeed it is a False Positiv=? And what do you do if you are on another list that you have 
never heard about? 
I say all of this because I recent=y read a story in the Huffington Post by Ben Walsh —=Your Financial Life Could Be Ruined 
If Your Name Is On This Massive Government List — about another gov=rnment list that I had never heard of. Take the 
case of Muhammed Ali Khan tried to do one of the most boring, responsible things an American taxpayer can do: set up 
a government-guaranteed retirement savings account.=He was rejected because the Treasury Department thought he 
might be a terroris=. But he isn't. He's a software consultant from Fullerton, =alifornia. But he shares a first name (with 
a different spelling), last name and middle initial with a financier of a Pakista=i terror group. 
=p class="MsoNormal">That man, Mohammad Naushad Alam Khan, is on the Treas=ry Department's Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked P=rsons List (SDN). 4,=A0The 1,026-page catalog lists people and organizations that 
U.S. citizens and residents are barred from doing busine=s with because of their ties to terror cells, drug cartels or rogue 
states.=C2* The SDN is essentially a financial no-fly list that cuts people off from U.S. banks — and, as a result, t=e 
global financial system. The SDN has more than doubled in length in the last five years. 
Khan later found out tha= his credit reports from Experian and TransUnion had also been flagged as a potential match. 
Luckily the tr=uble that caused him, was relatively minor — after he got over the shock of seeing a terrorism flag on h=s 
credit report, he spent a few hours navigating customer service lines with the Treasury Department and the two credit 
bureaus. He got his retirement=account set up and his credit reports cleared after providing some personal information 
to show th=t he was not the man who had financially supported the 2008 Mumbai attacks. <=pan> 
Some other people wrongly believed to be on the SDN — either because they share a name with someone who is or 
because their name partial=y matches an alias used by someone on the list (and international criminals often have a lot 
of aliases= — are hurt far worse than Khan. As a result they can have their airli=e ticket purchases rejected or hotel 
reservations declined. Their bank account= can be frozen. Loans to buy a home or a car can be declined. =ire transfers 
can be seized and held for up to a year while the freeze is litigated, which can destroy small businesses= block real estate 
transactions or delay inheritances. <=p> 
Such delays impose "a tremendous burden," said Peter Djinis, a former anti-money laundering regulato= at the Treasury 
Department. "It can become a business disadvantage to people whose =ame just happens to be similar to that of 
someone actually on the list," he =aid. "This is a real problem."
