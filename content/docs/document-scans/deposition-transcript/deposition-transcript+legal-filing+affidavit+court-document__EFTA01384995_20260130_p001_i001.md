our trade or business in excess of directly connected deductions is subject to the 100% prohibited 
transaction tax. 
If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we 
may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for that year if we arc entitled to relief under the Code. These 
relief provisions generally will be available if our failure to meet the tests is due to reasonable cause 
and not due to willful neglect, we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our U.S. federal 
income tax return and otherwise comply with the applicable Treasury Regulations. It is not possible, 
however, to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief 
provisions. For example, if we fail to satisfy the gross income tests because nonqualifying income that 
we intentionally incur unexpectedly exceeds the limits on nonqualifying income, the IRS could conclude 
that the failure to satisfy the tests was not due to reasonable cause. If these relief provisions are 
inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances involving us, we will fail to qualify as a REIT. Even if 
these relief provisions apply, a tax would be imposed based on the amount of nonqualifying income. 
Asset DS Applicable to REIM 
At the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of 
our assets: 
(1) at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, 
cash, cash items and U.S. Government securities; 
(2) not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities other 
than those in the 75% asset class; 
(3) except for equity investments in REM, qualified REIT subsidiaries, other securities that 
qualify as "real estate assets" for purposes of the test described in clause (1) or securities of our 
TRSs: the value of any one issuer's securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our 
total assets; we may not own more than 10% of any one issuer's outstanding voting securities; and 
we may not own more than 10% of the value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer; and 
(4) not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of 
one or more TRSs. 
Securities for purposes of the asset tests may include debt securities that are not fully secured by a 
mortgage on real property (or treated as such). However, the 10% value test does not apply to certain 
"straight debt" and other excluded securities, as described in the Code including, but not limited to, 
any loan to an individual or estate, any obligation to pay rents from real property and any security 
issued by a REIT. In addition, for purposes of applying the 10% value test (a) a REirs interest as a 
partner in a partnership is not considered a security; (b) any debt instrument issued by a partnership 
(other than straight debt or another excluded security) will not be considered a security issued by the 
partnership if at least 75% of the partnership's gross income is derived from sources that would qualify 
for the 75% REIT gross income test; and (c) any debt instrument issued by a partnership (other than 
straight debt or another excluded security) will not be considered a security issued by the partnership to 
the extent of the REIT's interest as a partner in the partnership. In general, straight debt is defined as 
a written, unconditional promise to pay on demand or at a specific date a fixed principal amount, and 
the interest rate and payment dates on the debt must not be contingent on profits or the discretion of 
the debtor. In addition, straight debt may not contain a convertibility feature. Real estate assets for 
purposes of the above tests include shares in other qualifying REM and stock or debt instruments held 
for less than one year purchased with the proceeds from an offering of shares of our stock or certain 
debt. 
Our assets consist primarily of farmland, buildings and permanent crops, vines and trees, which are 
treated as real property for REIT purposes, and short term investments of cash. In addition, in the
