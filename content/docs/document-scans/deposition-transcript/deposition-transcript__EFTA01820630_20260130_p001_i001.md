the point is . I try and actually do what i can... when it comes to you , you refuse over and 
over. only thinking about yourself. I am not attacking you. at all. i am trying to get you to 
look in the mirror and see what i and everyone else sees. I have done hundreds of things that i 
totally disagree with , to placate you. In fact alomost every day or at least every weekend. 
what you now describe as thoughtful and selflless, started years ago when you decided that 
you didn't want 
around„ No one is at the house unless you agree, I eat the shitiest of 
food, and lead a life of a bus driver , with the same exact motivation that i had when i sent the 
email, I DO IT//// 
, v, sox, 
you do not. THink of my reaction with the email and 
yours with 
sox

Ok, you arc upset. 
Please remember you offered to do this last night so don't tell me I forced you into doing 
something you detest. I don't think I was forcefull at all...you offered a call, I said why not an 
email. I couldn't believe you really did something that thoughtful and selfless so I asked to see 
it. I said thank you many times because I know you did it for me and I know you didn't really 
understand what it meant or agreed with the idea behind it but you still did it. Don't attack me 
because of it now, take the credit. Frankly, it was a much better lesson than trying to argue 
with me or nag about my flaws. I got the message.

I bad previously asked whether you wanted to be in the house wiht 
so you could see for 
yourself , you have decided that the help i asked for was petty. Can i get you anything , 
head massage. 
tea, was not important. though I said these are the small things i d 
appreciate. then when others gladly do as i ask dim feel insecure. you feel no compunction 
to spoling my birthday, because you don't like=, spoling my highly anticipated trip to 
new york, because you overhear me talking on the phone and i according to you, said baby 
in kind tones. so you threw a tantrum. no sex fun, no hug, you waniked out without saying
