not going to suddenly emerge with stable politics, effective governance, security and 
human rights for its people, or an economy that offers 
lobs, development, and a fair share of the nationbs income."18 The risk is that when 
established governments fall, violence and instability may grow over the long term, 
rather than Western notions of democracy or peace.19 
Social Media Impacts on Saudi Security Laws 
In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested a social worker for using 
Twitter by spreading information to protesters about American police movements at the 
Group of 20 summit of global leaders 
in the United States. It turned out that while protesters were using social media to try to 
help other protesters escape arrest, the police were also monitoring the social media 
site to keep informed about protesters. The protester who was arrested claimed 
that the FBI wanted to crush "dissent."20 
Protesters and pundits in other countries may also make false claims about crushing 
dissent when, as in the United States, Great Britain, and other countries, the 
government imperative is to protect civilians 
from protesters who may turn violent. This extends to the Saudi governmentbs 
objective to monitor and defeat the use of social media in any potential terror-related or 
illegal means, which broadly parallels U.S. security policies upheld by Supreme Court 
decisions. 
A 2010 Supreme Court decision, Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project,21 made clear 
that almost all types of support for groups labeled as terrorists are banned,22 
apparently even if the support may turn out to 
be advice favoring nonviolence. In 2008, the U.S. Government started an investigation 
leading to that court case when activists began planning to hold lame demonstrations 
against war.23 
Analogous to the U.S. Supreme Courtbs decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law 
Project, the Kingdom restricts those who might try to provide any type of support for 
terrorists, including communication, whether 
by social media or other means. Also analogous to FBI investigations, the Saudi 
government has been known to monitor groups in the Kingdom, or communications 
about the Kingdom focused on various types of innocent-sounding "rights," particularly 
when such rights 
may turn out to involve any type of communication or support whatsoever with respect 
to terrorism. 
Consider the following. In mid-June 2011, the Washington Post published a report on 
FBI raids of homes belonging to labor organizers and peace activists.24 The American 
activists appear to have publicly criticizedbffis 
via '
I meth"  American foreign policy toward South America and the Middle East. They 
claimed that the U.S. Government was using antiterrorism policies as a pretext to target 
them for their political opinions.25 The FBI was looking toward the possibility 
that these citizens may have provided "material support"b which the atuens demedbfor
Palestinians and Colombians on U.S. Government terror suspect lists.26 Most of the 
Americans raided were non-Muslim and, according to one of their lawyers, were "public 
non-violent activists with long, distinguished careers in public service, including 
teachers, union organizers and antiwar and community leaders."27 Thus, Saudi 
Arabiabs national security and internal security approaches do not appear to be more 
restrictive 
than the U.S. Governmentbs deployment of FBI raids on American activists and 
organizers who have used social media to spread political opinions criticizing U.S. 
foreign policy and possibly implicating "material support" for terror suspects. 
Even apart from terrorism, public safety is a paramount concern for government 
entities that may need to take action by monitoring communication, whether through 
social media or analogously by cell phone.
