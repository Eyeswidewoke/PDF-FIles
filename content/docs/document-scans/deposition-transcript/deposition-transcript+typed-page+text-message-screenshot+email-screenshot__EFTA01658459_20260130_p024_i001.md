acrimony on Friday." The Post adds that "in private, Pelosi began to refer to Meadows as 'The 
Enforcer,' the implication being he was there to ensure Mnuchin didn't make a deal with the 
Democrats." And "now, Democrats are facing questions about their tactics and whether playing 
hard ball will continue to work when someone like Meadows is intimately involved." A "senior 
administration official disputed the Democrats' complaints about Meadows' role, calling it 
'comical' to suggest that he or anyone else in the administration didn't want a deal. Instead, 
this person said, Democrats were to blame." Added the "senior administration official," "It's 
obvious they've made a political calculation that they won't be held accountable for obstructing 
during a weak economy, and therefore they have no interest in a deal unless they land a bunch 
of policy wishlist items along the way." 
Trump Accuses "RINO Ben Sasse" Of Playing "Right Into The Hands" Of 
Democrats. Politico (8/10, Forgey, 4.29M) reports that on Monday, Trump "accused Sen. Ben 
Sasse of being a 'RINO' who had 'gone rogue' by scolding the White House for a recent 
collection of executive actions meant to provide assistance to Americans amid the coronavirus 
pandemic." Politico says Trump's "admonishment of Sasse comes after the Nebraska Republican 
issued a scathing statement in response to the president's announcement of four relief 
measures after a breakdown in talks between White House negotiators and congressional 
Democrats. ... 'The pen-and-phone theory of executive lawmaking is unconstitutional slop' 
Sasse said Saturday night." The President tweeted yesterday, "RINO Ben Sasse, who needed 
my support and endorsement in order to get the Republican nomination for Senate from the 
GREAT State of Nebraska, has, now that he's got it (Thank you President T), gone rogue, again. 
This foolishness plays right into the hands of the Radical Left Dems!" USA Today (8/10, Jackson, 
10.31M) and The Hill (8/10, Samuels, 2.98M), among other news outlets, also cover Trump's 
tweet. 
NYTimes Analysis: Businesses Cool To Trump's Payroll Tax Holiday. The New 
York Times (8/10, Rappeport, Friedman, 18.61M) reports that although the White House has 
touted its payroll tax holiday "as a boon to American workers that would fatten their paychecks 
and provide a jolt to the economy," for "companies large and small, the presidential 
intervention poses difficult legal and logistical questions that only add to the uncertainty that 
executives and workers are contending with during the pandemic." Because Trump "is only 
suspending the tax, not cutting it, the money that companies would cease to withhold from 
their employees' earnings would have to be paid next year, barring legislative action." 
Companies wold face "some complex accounting maneuvering," and employees could face "an 
unwanted tax bill in 2021, making the break more of a headache." According to the Times, 
"businesses have been cool to the idea." 
Yesterday's Stock Gains Attributed To Trump's Executive Actions. The AP (8/9, 
Choe) reports that "US stock indexes closed mostly higher Monday, nudging the S&P 500 within 
striking distance of its all-time high set in February." The AP adds, "The gains came on the first 
trading day since...Trump announced several stopgap moves to aid the economy in response to 
the collapse of talks on Capitol Hill for a bigger rescue package." The S&P "gained 9.19 points to 
3,360.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 357.96 points, or 1.3%, to 27,791.44. The 
Nasdaq composite lost 42.63 points, or 0.4%, to 10,968.36." 
The AP (8/9, Choe) also reports that "bets on a potential coronavirus vaccine, historic 
fiscal and monetary support, and more recently, a better-than-expected second-quarter 
earnings season have brought the S&P 500 close to its February record closing high." Moreover, 
"Trump signed executive orders that partly restored enhanced unemployment benefits after 
talks between the White House and top Democrats in Congress about fresh stimulus broke 
down last week." 
Trump To Propose Further Tax Cuts This Fall. The Washington Times (8/10, Boyer, 
Sherfinski, Swoyer, 492K) reports that "at an evening news conference, also said he will 
propose more tax cuts this fall for middle-class families and to reduce capital gains taxes."
