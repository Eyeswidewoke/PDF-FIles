Division's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section to confirm our interpretation of the law before 
approving their indictment package. I am thus surprised to read a letter addressed to Department 
Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been raised with this Office previously or that 
have been raised, and in fact resolved, in your client's favor. 
I am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this Agreement. The AUSAs who 
have been negotiating with defense counsel have for some time complained to me regarding the 
tactics used by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as resolution is reached on one 
issue, defense counsel finds ways to challenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has 
been that defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the client. That said, there must 
be closure on this matter. Some in our Office are deeply concerned that defense counsel will 
continue to mount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even after Mr. Epstein has 
entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the agreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind. 
Finally, I am most concerned about any belief on the part of defense counsel that the 
Agreement is unethical, unlawful or unconstitutional in any way. 
In closing, I would ask that you consult with co-counsel. If after consultations within the 
defense team, you believe that our Agreement is unethical, unlawful or unconstitutional, I would ask 
that you notify us immediately so that we can discuss the matter by phone or in person. I have 
consulted with the chief prosecutor in this case, who has advised me that she is ready to unwind the 
Agreement and proceed to trial if necessary or if appropriate. 
I would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force the hand of a defendant 
to enter into an agreement against his wishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although 
time is of the essence (I understand that certain filings are due to our Office no later than December 
71h and that certain events must take place no later than December 14?), I am directing our 
prosecutors not to issue victim notification letters until this Friday at 5 p.m., to provide you with time 
to review these options with your client. We are available by phone or in person, in the interim, to 
It is not clear from your letter whether you believe that attorneys in this Office have acted improperly. 
Your letter, for example, alludes to the need to engage in an inquiry to assure that disclosures to potential 
witnesses did not undermine the reliability of the results of this federal investigation. As a former 
Department of Justice attorne I am certain that you recognize that this is a serious allegation. I have 
raised this matter with 
who informed me that the victims were not told of the availability 
of Section 2255 relief during the investigation phase of this matter. If you have specific concerns, I ask that 
you raise these with me immediately, so that I can make appropriate inquiries.
