The Hendersonville (NC  ) Times-News (8/24, Burgess, 26K) recounts that Trump said after 
his tour of Flavor 1st in Henderson County, "Today we're here to celebrate the incredible work 
of the farmers and faith leaders and amazing volunteers who are caring for their community." 
The President also "offered support to Madison Cawthorn, 11th Congressional District GOP 
candidate, saying `You're going to be a star of the party.' Trump also "joked that if he `had a 
face' like Cawthorn's he would have been president 20 years ago." 
AgWeb (8/24, Karst, 18K) recounts that "the program originally authorized $3 billion for 
the boxes and was expected to spend a total of $2.67 billion from mid-May through the end of 
August, covering the first two rounds of the program." AgWeb adds that "according to the 
USDA, 35.6 million food boxes were distributed May 15-June 30 in the first round, and 35.1 
million food boxes were distributed from July 1 to Aug. 24 in the second round, which ends 
Aug. 31." The third round "begins Sept. 1 and ends Oct. 31." Reuters (8/24, Mason) reports, 
however, that "the program was criticized by food banks, analysts and some US senators, who 
said contracts were often awarded to inexperienced vendors that were unable to source the 
food and deliver it in a timely manner." 
Newsweek (8/24, Crisp, 1.53M) also says "Farmers to Families, which is run through the 
US Department of Agriculture, quickly came under scrutiny over allegations that it awarded 
contracts to dubious entities and concerns that it might not provide food in an `efficient and 
equitable way.' Farmers "who spoke to Newsweek, however, said they benefited from the 
program and, in some cases, credited it for saving their livelihood," while "White House 
officials...told Newsweek the kinks have largely been ironed out and there's potential for the 
program to continue in some form long term." Said Ivanka Trump, "It truly is an historic 
program in terms of the scale and in terms of its impact. ... It was really `How do we connect 
the farmer with the person most in need?' It was a common sense, but innovative, solution." 
The Washington Times (8/24, Howell, 492K) says "Trump doesn't have a kind word for 
China these days but he praised at least one `smart' move by the communist nation during a 
swing-state stop Monday - two bulk orders of corn that will lift US farmers, a critical voting 
bloc." Said Trump, "The largest order of corn in the history of our country, twice. Largest order 
of soybeans in history." The Times adds that "stepping into full campaign mode, Mr. Trump is 
highlighting the hard-working men and women of the heartland every chance he gets." 
WXII-TVVi Winston-Salem, NC (8/24, 26K) reported that Trump also "talked about policy 
- of course with this USDA program, but he also got into politics, hitting on the media and 
Democratic governors including Roy Cooper." Trump was shown saying, "It was very important 
for me to come to North Carolina because we wanted to be here but your governor didn't allow 
it because he's in a shutdown mode along with a lot of other Democrat governors, and it's too 
bad." 
The Hendersonville (NC ) Lightning (8/24, Moss) reports the President painted "an 
optimistic picture of an economic recovery and of an end to the coronavirus pandemic," and 
"pointed to recent jobs gains, trade deals and a surging stock market as indicators of a brighter 
future." Said Trump, "Already the great American comeback is very much under way." The 
Lightning adds "crowds of Trump supporters lined the motorcade route, a huge deployment of 
law officers and Secret Service agents secured the president's destination, a giant American 
flag strung from a Mills River fire truck flaps in the breeze over Banner Farm Road and the 
stage was set for President Trump to make remarks - as far as is publicly known the first visit 
to Henderson County by a sitting president since George H.W. Bush visited in 1992." 
The Asheville (NC) Citizen-Times (8/24, Boyle, 138K) reports, "It's not often that this 
sleepy, mostly rural hamlet sees the kind of excitement it had Aug. 24," as "hundreds of fans of 
President Donald Trump - and a few who oppose him - came out to see the commander in 
chief on his way to and from a Mills River produce production company. ... Few if any of Trump's 
supporters wore masks, and most didn't seem to worry about social distancing, despite the 
pandemic."
