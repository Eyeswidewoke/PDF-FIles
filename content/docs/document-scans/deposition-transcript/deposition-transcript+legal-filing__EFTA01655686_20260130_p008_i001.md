Karen Read Case: Defense Confirms It Paid Crash Experts Hired by FBI After Trial 
Mass Live (02/25, McKenna) reported that at a hearing on Tuesday, defense lawyers for Karen Read sought to 
downplay the extent of the communications they had with a pair of accident reconstructionists hired by the federal 
government on the case. Judge Beverly Cannone scheduled Tuesday's hearing after prosecutors disclosed 
previously unknown communications between the experts and Alan Jackson, an attorney for Read, at a hearing last 
week. Specially Appointed Prosecutor Hank Brennan disclosed an invoice from the experts, who work for the firm 
ARCCA, sent to Read and that one of the experts, Daniel Wolfe, provided an outline of his testimony. According to 
the article, while Robert Alessi, an attorney hired by Read after the first trial, confirmed Read paid the nearly 
$24,000 bill, he said she only did so after the trial had concluded and after receiving the go-ahead from the U.S. 
Attorney's office for Massachusetts. The bill "came out of the blue" from ARCCA, Alessi said. Read's defense 
received the bill on July 12, 2024, and a check was sent to ARCCA on July 25. Read's first trial concluded when 
Cannone declared a mistrial on July 1. In his remarks on Tuesday, Brennan said the "only people surprised they 
were paying was (the) defense." Both prosecutors and Read's defense received a report from ARCCA that 
concluded her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, was not hit by a car as prosecutors have concluded. ARCCA was originally 
hired by the federal government and Read's lawyers said at trial they did not pay the firm. Brennan also suggested 
there might be further, unknown communications between her lawyers and the expert witnesses.

Jury Should Hear Words of Accused Kavanaugh Assassination Plotter, Feds Say 
The Washington Post (02/25, Morse) reported that jurors should be entitled to hear what the California man 
accused of plotting to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh told investigators, federal prosecutors 
said in court filings late Monday, arguing that his interview was legally proper. The article added that investigators 
also had the right, prosecutors said, to conduct a warrantless search of a suitcase belonging to 29-year-old Nicholas 
Roske. They said he brought the luggage with him on a cross-county flight June 7, 2022, and then in a cab to 
Kavanaugh's neighborhood in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The suitcase contained burglary tools, an unloaded handgun 
and two magazines of ammunition, according to the filing. Roske halted his plan to break into Kavanaugh's house 
because he was spooked by a security detail posted outside, authorities say. He turned around and wheeled his 
suitcase down the darkened, narrow streets just north of Washington. Roske then spoke by phone with his sister, 
who persuaded him to call 911, which he did about two blocks from Kavanaugh's home, according to court records 
and police officials. Local officers from Montgomery County responded and arrested him. The filings are the latest 
legal match ahead of Roske's trial, set to begin June 9 in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland. His attorneys 
had earlier asked the court to toss out statements Roske made to investigators after his arrest because he was in 
obvious mental distress and wasn't properly advised of his rights to remain silent and consult a lawyer.
