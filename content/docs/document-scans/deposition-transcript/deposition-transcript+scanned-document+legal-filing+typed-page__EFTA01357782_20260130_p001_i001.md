HY Corporate Credit 
Energy 
In the past what has caused the banks to decrease RBLs for HY issuers,? 
Overall, since the mid-1990s (start of reliable data), lenders have seen par 
recovery on RBL facilities in all distressed and bankruptcy situations according 
to S&P. 
There are two main reason why this is the case. First, reserve 
engineers at the major lending banks use a lower price deck than the actual 
commodity strip price as a base case. And beyond that, the banks run a further 
sensitivity (aka downside case) that they generally rely on to give them 
confidence during commodity market dislocations like this one. The second 
reason banks haven't taken losses on these RBLs is that internal reserve 
engineers also take a additional discount to the already discounted (9-10%) 
expected cash flows coming from an E&P's proved reserves. 
Generally, 
Proved Developed Producing reserve are discounted at 25%; Proved 
Developed Non-Producing are discounted at 50%; Proved Undeveloped (PUDs) 
are discounted at 75%. This is in addition to subtracting out the expected cash 
flow for the next 6 months of planned production out of the RBL borrowing 
base. 
This borrowing base calculation does however give producers the 
benefit of hedges. 
Given a lack of material losses in the types of products banks are generally 
reluctant to materially reduce the RBLs of E&P especially during dislocations 
like the one we are seeing in oil right now. The general philosophy of the 
lending banks has been to be more conservative in both directions. When 
commodities (oil, nat gas) are rallying, banks are slow to move the price deck 
up; however, the same is true on the way down, which benefits E&Ps in 
today's bear oil market. That said, borrowing bases were reduced in 08/09, 
although these reductions were very minor compared to the over 70% decline 
in oil prices. 
There have been situations where the banks will reduce 
borrowing bases more meaningfully. This can happen when an E&P with an 
already weak financial profile enters a bear commodity market, or an E&P 
experiences a sudden change in its reserves or production profile (dramatic 
and unexpected cost increase, reserve write downs, unexpected decline in 
current production). 
Can E8Ps raise more money in the HY market today? 
If necessary BB-rated E&Ps can come to market to issue given average 
spreads in the 450.470 bps range; looking at our previous liquidity overview, 
one can see that most of these E&P are in good shape and don't need to issue. 
Moving down the credit spectrum, lower-rated single-B and triple-C companies 
are the ones more likely to need the capital. Given that the spreads for energy 
single-B and triple-C companies are currently 950-970bps and 1,880-1,900bps, 
respectively, we don't see more traditional unsecured HY deals as feasible 
today. 
This highlights the cost of capital problem that lower rated E&P 
companies now face - these are the real "have nots" in our minds. 
With traditional HY avenues not open to them we believe two trends will 
emerge. First, we will see more bilateral deals between E&Ps and providers of 
capital (private equity, recently-launched energy funds, special situations 
funds). We have already seen one recent example of this between Linn Energy 
(LINE) and GSO/ Blackstone (BX). LINE now has a five- year $500 million 
agreement whereby GSO will earn up to a 15% RoR on wells drilled by LINE in 
exchange for providing 100% of the upfront drilling costs. EXCO Resources 
(XCO) led the way on transactions like this; it struck a similar agreement with 
KKR & Co (KKR) in July 2013 in the Eagle Ford. Rightly so, we believe 
investors would rather invest in a company and make survival a self fulfilling 
prophecy rather than try to build sizable positions through the secondary 
market where ownership brings no incremental certainty around survival. The 
second trend will be second lien deals. E&P bond indentures are written with 
relatively open language around the way credit facilities are defined and the
