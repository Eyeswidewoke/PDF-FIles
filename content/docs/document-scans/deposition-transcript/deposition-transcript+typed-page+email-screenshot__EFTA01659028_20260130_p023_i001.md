The Washington Post (10/22, Barrett, 14.2M) reports, "The Justice Department is preparing to 
announce a new effort to withhold federal grant money from police departments that don't 
meet or try to meet certification standards on the use of force." The Post says the "ambitious 
idea with so far few specifics" is "to be unveiled days before a national election in which police 
conduct has been hotly debated." The Post cites "a five-page draft document," which "broadly 
defines how the Trump administration intends to apply an executive order signed by the 
president on safe policing." The draft says the effort seeks to "improve policies and procedures 
- ensuring transparent, safe, and accountable delivery of services to our communities." 
FBI Agents Visit South Dakota Winter Housing Camp. 
The Rapid City (SD) Journal (10/22, Zionts, 106K) reports, "The FBI on Thursday visited Camp 
Mniluzahan, a Lakota-run winter camp established on tribal land outside Rapid City jurisdiction." 
The Journal adds, "The camp was established by Creek Patrol members on Sunday after an 
initial attempt to create it on public land Friday in Rapid City. The Rapid City Police Department 
ordered the group to take down four tipis, saying they violated city ordinances related to tents, 
public events and the flood plain. Officers arrested six people who stayed inside a tipi. The 
Thursday meeting with the FBI agents was not tense like the event on Oct. 16. FBI agents and 
some Creek Patrol members laughed and shook hands toward the end of the short meeting." 
KNBN-TV Rapid City, SD (10/22, Murat) reports, "New developments Thursday regarding a 
homeless camp recently removed from Rapid City's jurisdiction, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigations paying the camp a visit in their new remote location. This week, the Mni Luzahan 
Creek Patrol set up a remote camp site for a number of people considered homeless in the 
community. After tensions rose over the weekend when tipis were set up to house people in a 
flood zone along Rapid Creek, the patrol opted to move the camp to tribal land outside of the 
city's jurisdiction." KNBN-TV adds, "A Facebook video streamed by Carrie MiddleTent early 
Thursday afternoon shows Creek Patrol members speaking with three FBI agents." 
Walmart Sues Federal Government Over Opioid Crisis. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/22, Al, Kendall, Randazzo, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports 
Walmart filed a lawsuit Thursday claiming the Justice Department and DEA are trying to 
scapegoat it for the government's regulatory and enforcement failures with regard to the opioid 
crisis. The AP (10/22, D'Innocenzio) calls Walmart's lawsuit "a pre-emptive strike in the battle 
over its responsibility in the opioid abuse crisis. The government is expected to take civil action 
against" the company, "seeking big financial penalties, for the role its pharmacies may have 
played in the crisis by filling opioid prescriptions." Reuters (10/22, Nivedita) reports Walmart 
said in a statement, "We are bringing this lawsuit because there is no federal law requiring 
pharmacists to interfere in the doctor-patient relationship to the degree DOJ is demanding." 
Bloomberg (10/22, Feeley, 4.73M)provides similar coverage. 
WPost: Judgment Against Purdue Pharma Is "Modest." 
In an editorial, the Washington Post (10/22, 14.2M) says Purdue Pharma has "agreed to plead 
guilty to misleading the Drug Enforcement Administration in ways that resulted in otherwise-
impermissible amounts of its drug" OxyContin "reaching the market, and to paying doctors and 
others kickbacks for helping increase sales." The company will pay "$8.3 billion worth of fines 
and other payments that also resolves potential federal civil complaints against the company." 
The Post argues while it may be "useful...to the Trump campaign as Election Day approaches, 
this measure of justice is modest indeed."
