FBI Busts Chinese Nationals For Multi-Million Dollar Drug Ring, Exploiting Immigration System 
The Daily Wire (07/09, Mahieu) reported that the FBI busted a multi-million dollar marijuana trafficking scheme 
run by Chinese nationals, the Justice Department said Tuesday. Seven Chinese nationals were charged over an 
alleged marijuana conspiracy operating out of Massachusetts and Maine. Investigators said that the operation, 
which began in January 2020, generated millions of dollars by distributing kilogram-sized quantities of marijuana in 
bulk. Those charged are 39-year-old Jianxiong Chen, 36-year-old Yuxiong Wu, 38-year-old Dinghui Li, 35-year-old 
Dechao Ma, 35-year-old Peng Lian Zhu, 35-year-old Hongbin Wu, and 47-year-old Yanrong Zhu. Yanrong Zhu 
"remains a fugitive," while the others were all taken into federal custody, according to the D0J. FBI agent Ted Docks 
said that Chen, who lived in Braintree, Massachusetts, a city about 12 miles south of Boston, smuggled Chinese 
nationals over the Mexican border and forced them to work at marijuana grow houses to pay off the smuggling 
fees and get their passports back. In the last several years, Chinese-backed marijuana operations have cropped up 
across the United States, and there have been major drug busts in states like New Mexico and Maine. In Maine 
alone, Border Patrol has reportedly identified at least 270 illegal marijuana grow operations that are worth billions 
of dollars. The Greenfield Recorder (07/09, Cammalleri) also reported on the story. 
FBI Warns of Increase in 'Ramp-And-Dump' Stock Fraud 
WHNT (CBS-19) (07/09, Teutsch) reported that the FBI said fraudsters are targeting U.S. stock investors at an 
increased rate in 2025 compared to previous years. The FBI posted a public service announcement on July 3, 
warning the public about criminals who are targeting U.S. stock investors through social media platforms and other 
messaging apps. "The scheme, known as a 'ramp-and-dump' stock manipulation, targets US investors through 
online engagement, often via social media advertisements or messages promoting an 'investment club' of fellow 
investors, some of which may be bots or fake accounts," the FBI said. To appear credible, the FBI said perpetrators 
may present themselves as legitimate brokerage firms or well-known stock analysts. 
Police Thwart Scammer in Pennsylvania Posing as FBI Attempting to Steal $27,000 
WHTM (ABC-27) (07/09, Weaver, Stockburger) reported that scammers posing as the "FBI" in an attempt to steal 
$27,000 from a Cumberland County woman were thwarted Tuesday by police. Court documents filed by Silver 
Spring Township Police show, a 73-year-old woman got a text Monday about unusual activity on her Apple ID, and 
she called the number provided. Court documents show that's when she began talking with the scammers claiming 
to be the "FBI," who told her she owed them $27,000. She was instructed to withdraw and then deposit the cash at 
different ATMs. The article added that after the victim told the scammers she wasn't comfortable with that, they 
told her an "agent" would come to her house to get the money. Police said the victim was instructed not to tell 
anyone about the situation, to send pictures of her ID and cash to the "FBI." She then put the cash in a box. Police 
were made aware Tuesday of the scam by the victim's relative, who reported that the woman was on the phone 
with a suspected scammer. "Please talk to your family members, especially older ones, about the dangers of scams 
and that no law enforcement agent, from any department or agency, will demand cash, cryptocurrency, or gift card 
payments over the phone or in person to avoid incarceration," said Silver Spring Township Police Chief Christopher 
Raubenstine. Raubenstine says follow-up investigations are ongoing with ICE and the FBI into similar 
incidents. WPMT (Fox-43) (07/09, Schweigert) and WHP (CBS-19) (07/09, Embry) also reported on the story.

Tuesday. The local team of expert divers worked closely with federal agents, deploying sonar, and deep diving 
techniques to aid in the recovery effort. SCFR officials said, "This collaboration demonstrates not only the skill and 
professionalism of our dive team, but also our commitment to public service and justice. We are honored to have
