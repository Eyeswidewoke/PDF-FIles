I suspect that forcing children t= do anything is probably harmful. But it's 
possible to introduce=writing and (secondarily) reading in a way that seems to enhance thinking..C2* That's the idea 
behind "invented spelling" (here's=a link to some of the work:

).=C240 Back in the early '50s, a philosopher friend of mine (Israel Sch=ffler) brought me some pages on which his two-
year old son had written thi=gs that he thought were gibberish, wondering if I could make something of =t. It was 
immediately obvious that the kind had learned the names of=the letters and was spontaneously stringing them together 
to express himse=f in writing. And making interesting generalizations. Thus the=letter "A", pronounced /ey/, he used 
for the words "came,&q=ot; "pet", "pat"; the letter "i", pronounced=/ay/, he used for "pie", "pot," "butt" . And=so on. It 
all made sense. Our kids did the same thing. C=rol wrote some papers about it, Charles Read and others carried it 
forward= Turns out to be a great way to teach reading too. Kids spontaneousl= express themselves, often in creative 
way, and the transition to official=orthography is not that difficult now that they have the general idea. 
There's a debate about it in educational circles,=and though I haven't followed 
it, my impression is that old-fashioned =arcing into a mold probably wins out, undermining the joy of self-expressi=n and 
possibly reading. 
As you may know, Galileo regarded in=ention of the alphabet as among the 
greatest of all human inventions. Can =o no better than quote his own words. He regarded the invention of t=e 
alphabet as "surpassing all stupendous inventions," asking =E24,40what sublimity of mind was his who dreamed of 
finding means to communicate his deepest though=s to any other person, though distant by mighty intervals of place 
and time! =f talking with those who are in India; of speaking to those who are not yet b=rn and will not be born for a 
thousand or ten thousand years; and with what facility, by the different arrangements of twenty characters upon a 
page!=E2Q, 
Shortly after, the same observati=n was made about the more fundamental 
matter of sounds (Port Royal Grammar= 1660). I discovered all of this about 50 years ago and wrote about =t. Unknown 
then, still unknown, in my view some of the most profound=insights in the human sciences. 
Smart guys, the f=unders of modern science.
