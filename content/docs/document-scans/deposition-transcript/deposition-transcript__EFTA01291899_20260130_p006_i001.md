Schedule of Realized Gains and Losses Current Period (continued) 
W hen you report your cost basis on your tax return, it should be verified using all of your own records. In particular, there may be other adjustments which you need to make, but are not 
required to be made by Pershing as it relates to H.R. 1424. You should consult with your tax advisor in order to properly report your gain or loss for tax purposes. Pershing shall not be 
responsible for and makes no representations or warranties with respect to the accuracy of any information that you report to the IRS or other taxing authorities, and, accordingly, disclaims 
any and all liability that may arise with respect to your use and reliance on the information provided herein for such reporting. 
Please refer to the Your Account Information Section in your brokerage account statement for your account's existing tax-lot disposition method. The disposition method is the method which 
you have selected to use in the disposal of each tax lot of the securities held in your account. If you do not select a method, your account will be defaulted to First In, First Out (FIFO). Your 
account's selected tax lot method will be used to determine the cost basis for calculating gain and/ or loss, unless another method was selected at the time of the security disposal, and this 
may be reported on the IRS Form 1099-B.

Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual 
fund. Shares of a money market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds 
credited to your brokerage account. Please see the money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for 
additional information. Pursuant to SEC Rule 10b-10(b)(1) confirmations are not sent for purchases into money market mutual funds processed on the sweep platform. 
The U.S. adopted a shortened settlement timeframe beginning with trade date September 5,2017, for equities, corporate and municipal bonds, and unit investment trusts. Moving 
from a T+3 to a T+2 settlement cycle provides faster access to sale proceeds, but it also means that funds are due on purchase transactions earlier. This may be a good time to 
consider e-delivery of your account documents-including trade confirmations, account statements and more. Ask your advisor or financial institution about how you can set up 
e-delivery.
