Jeffrey, 
I spoke to Nicolas, he is requesting to meet with you this weekend before you leave for 10 min. 
He is going to ask you if you want to lease him space in Air Centers hanger for him to start a new FBO on 
St Thomas,. He said he would sublease the whole hanger for his Fli1O and let us keep our helicopter in the 
hanger and he would sell us fuel at cost, he would pay the whole rent, and no expense to us. Not sure how 
or where he is getting the money, but Fm pretty sure he may ask you to back him,. 
He has a back up plan if we don't agree, it would be Cleo's trailer next to the hanger where Cleo operates 
his flight school,.and Nicolas could put his R44 in Cleo's hanger or he will ask again to have space in our 
hanger,. 
I don't see any advantage to working with Nicolas on this venture, we can get our own fuel truck and buy fuel 
direct without his help, and we don't need his helicopter in our hanger, 
. Cecile spoke to Dale Gregory at Port Authority, she is putting pressure on Dale to get us our approvals 
for Air Centers hanger space, and fuel truck approval, plus answers regarding a new Hanger building,. 
I have been just listening to Nicolas and keeping him at distance until we get the hanger awarded to us, Roy 
at the Jet Center told me Hancock as put application in for air centers hanger also,. I will stay on top of this, 
Ken Hobson has told Rod that we are getting the hanger,. only words at this point,. you may know more if 
John is working with you,. 
I told Nicolas its hard to commit or decide on anything until we are officially awarded the Hanger from Port 
Authority and how much space will be left after putting our helicopter and a fuel truck in the hanger in the 
near future, I'm trying to keep him at bay, and make sure he doesn't cause any waves. 
let me know if you want to meet with Nicolas when I arrive in Stt early afternoon Saturday? 
thanks, 
just keeping you in the gossip loop on STT. 
Larry
