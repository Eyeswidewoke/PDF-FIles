Instead, Mr. Epstein elected to ne otiate the Non-Prosecution A eement, and on September 
12, 2007, counsel for the United States 
Garcia, and 
and counsel for Mr. 
Epstein (Messrs. Lefcourt Lefkowitz and Goldberger) met with State Attorney Barry Krisher and 
Assistant State Attorney 
to discuss a plea to an Information in the state court that 
would satisfy the federal interest in the case. As noted on the term sheet of July 31', one of those 
essential terms was a guilty plea to a charge requiring sex offender registration. During that 
meeting, the issue of sex offender registration was raised, and Mr. Goldberger told the federal 
prosecutors that there was no problem, Mr. Epstein would plead guilty to the charge of solicitation 
of minors for prostitution (Fl. Stat. 796.03), which was one of the statutes listed on the original term 
sheet. Although our Office had wanted Mr. Epstein to plead guilty to three different offenses, we 
agreed to this compromise? Of course, we later learned that, at the time Mr. Goldberger made that 
statement, he incorrectly believed, based upon a statement from ASA 
that Fl. Stat. 
796.03 did not require sex offender registration. 
The parties then began working first on a plea agreement to a federal charge and, when it was 
clear that there was no guarantee the Mr. Epstein would serve his sentence in a minimum security 
prison camp, the discussion turned to a Non-Prosecution Agreement. Both the federal plea 
agreement and the Non-Prosecution Agreement included references to Section 2255 because neither 
the contemplated federal charges nor the proposed state charges encompassed all of the identified 
victims. If Mr. Epstein had been prosecuted under the planned indictment, the identified victims 
would have been eligible for restitution and damages under Section 2255. As explained above, one 
of the United States' interests, which had to be satisfied by the Non-Prosecution Agreement, was 
providing appropriate compensation to the victims. This provision of the
 was heavily 
negotiated. As Mr. Lefkowitz wrote in his November 29th e-mail to Mr. 
which we received 
the same day as your letter, your client "offered to provide a restitution fund for the alleged victims 
in this matter; however that option was rejected by [our] Office." The option was rejected for 
several reasons. First, the Office does not serve as legal representatives to the victims and has no 
authority to bind the victims, nor could it provide a monetary figure that would represent a "loss" 
amount for restitution purposes. Second, there would be no legal basis for federal restitution without 
a conviction for a federal offense. And, third, it was my belief that this Office should not be put in 
the position of administering a restitution fund. Our Section 2255 proposal put the victims in the 
same position that they would have been in if we had proceeded to trial and convicted Mr. Epstein 
of his crimes, with the exception that the victims were provided with counsel.' Your client and his 
'Another significant compromise reached at the meeting was a reduction in the amount of 
jail time — from twenty-four months down to eighteen months, which would be served at the Palm 
Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility. 
°As 
will address in his letter to Mr. Lefkowitz, Section 2255 provides that 
the perpetrator shall pay the attorney's fees of the victim, so the appointment of counsel was not 
such a benefit to the victims but, rather, was done, in part, to benefit Mr. Epstein by allowing him
