Dear SA Young 
I am writing in response to the subpoena or information request for the above-referenced matter 
(-Subpoena") directed to the above Subpoenaed Entity Subject to and without waiving the below 
objections,' the Responding Entity ("Capital One") has exercised reasonable diligence in searching 
its systems of record for the documents and/or information reasonably requested by the Subpoena, 
and the enclosed documents and/or information represent all available documents and/or 
information yielded by this search Please note that there are multiple Capital One entities and that 
the responsive documents produced herewith represent only those in the possession, custody, or 
control of the Responding Entity 
Please note that Capital One has a 7-year retention policy, account records older than 7 years may 
no longer be available in our systems of record, account statements prior to September 2007 are no 
longer in retention 
For this account opened online, no application, signature card or identification used to open the 
account were located Also, no IP history was found for the account closed in 2013 
Please also note that it is not possible for Capital One or any of its employees to represent that any 
document production contains "all documents" for any specific customer and/or account Based 
upon our interpretation of your request, however, we believe the enclosed documents fully satisfy 
your request Capital One shall assume that this response constitutes a full and complete response 
requiring no further action by Capital One in response to the Subpoena unless you should advise it 
I To the extent that the above-listed Subpoenaed Entity does not match the above-listed Responding Entity 
("Capital One"), Capital One objects to the Subpoena on the grounds that the Subpoena is directed to an 
incorrect legal entity, as the Subpoenaed Entity does not exist, is not a legal entity, or is not the correct 
entity to which the Subpoena should be directed. Information regarding Capital One entities is publicly 
available from Capital One's website (www.capitalone.com) and other public sources. These companies are 
separate and distinct legal entities, and subpoenas and other legal requests must be served separately 
upon the correct entity in full compliance with applicable law in order to permit a response. Capital One 
also objects to the Subpoena to the extent that (1) the method of service of the Subpoena is not 
specifically authorized by applicable law; (2) the Subpoena has not been issued in full compliance with all 
applicable law; (3) the Subpoena requests privileged or confidential information; (4) the full scope of the 
information requested by the Subpoena is not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of 
admissible evidence; (5) the Subpoena fails to provide sufficient information to uniquely identify some or 
all of the individuals and/or entities about which information is sought and/or (6) compliance with the 
Subpoena would pose an undue burden and expense upon Capital One. Capital One further reserves its 
right to assert any additional objection to the Subpoena.
