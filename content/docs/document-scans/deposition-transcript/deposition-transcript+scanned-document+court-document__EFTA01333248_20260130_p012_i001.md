purchase several gifts and provide them as tips to the girls. I asked 
what kind of gifts. Rodriguez stated he purchased IPODS, jewelry, 
anything the girls would want. 
Rodriguez stated the amount of girls that came to the house was 
approximately fifteen. 
Each of the girls knew each other and all 
seemed to know at 
High School who Mr. Epstein was. 
When asked to identify these girls, Rodriguez stated he could not at 
the moment but knew he wrote their names down on a journal he kept 
during his employ with Mr. Epstein. He kept a journal in the event he 
needed to explain either to Mr. Epstein or his assistants what was 
done at the house or who visited the house as he stated he was 
in-charge of Mr. Epstein's personal security while in Palm Beach. I 
informed him I would need to view this journal to which he stated he 
would research the book and contact me to provide the book. The 
interview was concluded and left the area. I returned back to the 
police station where the micro cassette was placed into evidence. At 
approximately 7:20 pm, I was notified Rodriguez located the journal 
and would call me on January 5, 2005 to provide the journal.

Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 
On January 5, 2006, I attempted to meet with Alfredo Rodriguez to 
recover the folder or journal in which he kept the notes that were 
given to him during his employ with Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. He kept this 
folder to justify what he did during his employ should the need arise 
to justify what occurred with the monies he had to keep or any 
questions as to the petty cash he withdrew from the household account 
from the bank. At approximately 10:00 pm, I attempted contact with 
Mr. Rodriguez and discovered he was assisting his wife at her place of 
employment and would not be able to meet with me. Mr. Rodriguez 
stated he would meet with me on January 6, 2006, in Broward County, in 
the morning hours. 
On January 6, 2006, at approximately 9:00 am, I received a telephone 
call from Mr. Rodriguez who advised he had the file in hand and would 
be traveling northbound to meet with me in Broward County. At 10:50 
am, I met with Alfredo Rodriguez at the parking lot of Bank of America 
in Boca Raton on Yamato Road and Military Trail (known as the Polo 
Center). Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, 
a note with Mr. Epstein's stationar with direction to 
bucket of roses t 
High School after 
high school drama erformance. Also in that same note was direction 
to rent a car for 
and direction to extend the rental 
contract. I returned to the Palm Beach Police Station and placed the 
folder into evidence. 
I received a fax from Verizon from the subpoena request sent on
