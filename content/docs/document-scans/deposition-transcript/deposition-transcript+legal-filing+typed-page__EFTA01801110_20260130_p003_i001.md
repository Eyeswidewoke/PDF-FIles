The UK government shows some reluctance to revisit its int=rpretation of the Vickers proposals. But if the British 
Parliamentary enqui=y into the LIBOR issue now concludes that the government has erred on the s=de of trusting banks, 
then the pressure for an outcome closer to the original Vickers recommendation, to b= written into next year's Banking 
Act, will be intense. 
The universal banking debate will take another serious twi=t if the new leadership of Barclays ultimately decides 
to break the bank up=into a retail bank and an investment bank and broker/dealer. As extreme as t=is sounds, the 
intangible costs in political and regulatory animus Barclays now attracts could suggest that=a clean break makes sense. 
An arrangement that gave existing shareholders a=stake in both new institutions might be acceptable. 
Barclays would no doubt sell such a split as a smart comme=cial move. But the political and regulatory subtext 
would be to undermine t=e case that such banking agglomerations are both necessary and useful. Alth=ugh the French 
and German commitment to their own universal banking systems is very strong, such a split would c=rtainly empower 
critics of the universal banking model in the EU and the US= The Liikanen Group inquiry is due to report to the European 
Commission on b=nk structure later this year. The Commission itself is then expected to issue its own recommendations 
on b=nk structure. Both will certainly draw on the Barclays experience.</=> 
The culture questi=n 
This bigger issue about the values of the trading floor is=going to prove hard to shake off. The role of securities 
divisions in drivi=g investment bank profits over the last two decades has predictably seen a g=neration of securities 
managers rise to the leadership of investment and universal banks. While it is perha=s unwise to generalise too much, 
most of these men have brought with them t=e directness and self-belief that comes with surviving a career on the 
trad=ng floor. 
They also bring with them a view of the market and of mark=t-making that is often at odds with the way most 
politicians understand the.. Watching Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs trying to explain to the US Sen=te in 2010 why 
it was legitimate for Goldman Sachs as a market maker to be both long and short in the US pro=erty market at the same 
time reinforced the point. There is a yawning gulf b=tween a trader's pragmatic view of financial markets and a wider 
po. itical and public audience who generally interpret the market maker's pragmatism as cynicism, detachment 
and=short termism, especially when it results in making a lot of money.<=p> 
Banks tend to be highly impatient with this public and pol=tical ambivalence. Most banks' response to efforts at 
greater regul=tion of securities markets have often been rooted in the argument that thes= markets are fundamentally a 
forum for free trade between consenting adults and should be treated as such. It is t=is argument that the LIBOR-
scandal, with its taint of market fixing, and th= persistent flow of suggestions of contempt for customers and clients, 
does=so much to undermine. 
The events of the last two months have succeeded in cement=ng for good the idea that the banking crisis of 
2008 was ultimately the res=lt of unethical, 'casino' behaviour on the trading floor. W=atever failings banks might have 
exhibited in their ethical standards here, the reality is that the banking crisis had it= roots in poor lending and risk 
standards, and poor management of loan book=funding, rather than wild gambles or duplicity in the securities markets. 
T=e Vickers Commission explicitly recognised this by focusing on raising capital standards at the retail bank= that make 
up the backbone of the British credit system. 
Recent huge losses in the Chief Investment Office at J P M=rgan and conduct like that of Barclays' traders have 
made thi= distinction far too subtle to insist upon politically. This may not matter=much in regulatory terms — regulators 
have already embarked on a wide range of securities markets reforms. But it will=help embed the persistent political 
idea that retail banking is inherently Q=8OQsafe' while investment banking and securities markets business=is 
inherently 'risky'. To which recent events have added the taint of suspect ethical conduct.
