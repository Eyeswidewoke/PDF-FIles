have right now is we're in Donald Trump's America. To quote Kellyanne Conway, she said, and 
I'm paraphrasing today, that they're looking for more violence and more destruction because it 
helps them politically. He views this as a political benefit to him, he's rooting for more violence, 
not less, and he's clear about that. What's he doing? He's pouring gasoline on the fire. ... I 
think he views it as a political benefit." Axios (8/27, Allassan, 521K) indicates "Biden pointed to 
comments made by...Conway, who told Fox News that `the more chaos and anarchy and 
vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who's best on public 
safety and law and order.' 
The story was not covered on the major broadcast networks. Bloomberg (8/27, Epstein, 
4.73M) reports "Biden on Thursday accused...Trump of wanting violence on the streets to help 
boost his re-election chances," and the AP (8/27, Weissert) that he "also said that, if he were 
president, he would travel to Wisconsin personally and that he had considered going anyway, 
but that he does not `want to be part of the problem." Largely echoing Biden's argument, the 
New York Times (8/27, Flegenheimer, Glueck, 18.61M) runs an analysis piece titled 
"Republicans Insist Only Trump Can Stop This Chaos. But He's In Charge Now." 
The Washington Examiner (8/27, Larsen, 448K) reports "Biden pushed back against 
arguments from Vice President Mike Pence, President Trump, and others speaking at this week's 
national convention who argue that a Biden presidency would lead to more riots and violence 
and asserted that right-wing, white supremacist hate groups are responsible for much of the 
violence in recent riots." 
CNBC (8/27, Breuninger, 3.62M) reports on its website, "Trump campaign spokesman Tim 
Murtaugh responded in a statement to CNBC that Biden's `desperation is showing,' adding that 
Trump has 'repeatedly condemned the violence erupting in Democrat-led cities.' Added 
Murtaugh, "This is election is a choice between President Trump's strong stance with law and 
order and Joe Biden's acquiescence to the anti-police left and siding with rioters." The White 
House, meanwhile, "declined to comment on Biden's remarks." 
The Hill (8/27, Samuels, 2.98M) reports "Trump allies have attempted to tie the more 
violent aspects of the protests to Biden, arguing that he would cut police funding and accusing 
him of failing to condemn the violence as part of a broader effort to convince suburban voters 
that their lifestyle may be jeopardized if Trump is not re-elected." Politico (8/27, Choi, 4.29M) 
quotes White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner as saying, "We're offering solutions with 
policy. ... The other side's doing a lot of complaining." The Washington Times (8/27, Sherfinski, 
492K), the Washington Examiner (8/27, Simonson, 448K), Reuters (8/27, Hunnicutt), and 
Breitbart (8/27, Key, 673K), among other news outlets, also report the story. 
Despite Ferguson, Baltimore, Charlotte, Biden Says No Violent Riots During 
Obama Years. Biden also told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell ReportsVI (8/27, 1.25M) that for the 
last four years of the Obama Administration, "we weren't having riots, racial riots. ... When 
they occurred, we didn't have to call in the National Guard." Fox News (8/27, Blitzer, 27.59M) 
reports on its website that Biden "appeared to overlook multiple major events that took place 
during the Obama-Biden administration," including "in Ferguson, Mo., following the 2014 police 
shooting of Michael Brown. As violence overtook the St. Louis suburb, Gov. Jay Nixon did indeed 
call in the National Guard." Fox adds that "then in April 2015, the city of Baltimore experienced 
nights of rioting, looting and arson in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray, 25, in police 
custody. The Maryland National Guard was called up" too. In September 2016, "protests in 
Charlotte, N.C., over the death of Keith Lamont Scott, 43, turned violent," and "Gov. Pat 
McCrory declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard." 
WTimes Analysis: Fearing Violence Lifting Trump, Democrats Rethink Riot 
Response. The Washington Times (8/27, Swoyer, 492K) reports, "Top Democrats scrambled 
to adopt a tougher approach this week to riots that have broken out in cities across the country, 
casting a worried eye at...Trump's rising poll numbers, which experts said were driven at least 
partly by his law-and-order message." The Times adds "Americans tell pollsters they are tiring
