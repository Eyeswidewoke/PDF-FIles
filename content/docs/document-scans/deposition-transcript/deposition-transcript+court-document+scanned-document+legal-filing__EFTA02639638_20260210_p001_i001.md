1 had I =nown in the beginning what i know now, I would never have gotten inv=lved with ana s issue never ! ever.! . 
/ I have 40 years of=experience dealing with the IRS , I never have cheated ,evaded=C2 or crafted ridiculous returns . 
I am m=nical in taking carefully crafted thoughtful positions that ev=n if I dont win the full amount ,( and i have no 
recollection of any=total loss on any position.) . my credibility with the IRS =AO is unsurpassed. my research is 
detailed and the=case laws are always relevant. 
Ana =AO is emblematic of my warning s and advice that continues 
to go unh=eded. . I have repeatedly told you that these girls , al= want to show that they are clever, they have no 
experience wi=h the rules, money or biz . and always push the envelope beyon= the pale 
unfortunately usually 
ending up getting the =rincipal in trouble.. ( sometimes by design , but i m sure , =C2 not in this case ). For six months 
I have asked you , he= and her gay bookkeeper if there was something i didn't know , a= I found this entire exercise 
highly unusual. highly after yo= with the usual voice of authority telling me in no uncertain terms =C2 "what the agent 
really wants" . I continue to =e amazed how you , barry, and brad share very strong detailed views =AO without even 
one day of true experience. I will review with=you the facts on the phone . 
2. I can easily ignore th= fact that your concern of deductibity of the first 100 million that saved=your financial life. and 
provided a resurrection of 3 billion dollar= of grats=/span> that had died is not balanced by the recognition of what you 
=ad received and not then even paid for . Each time you have chosen =ot to pay what we agreed. or what has been 
written by me in ma=y emails BEFORE the transactions are complete. you tell me tha= torn and joslin= advice is one of 
the reasons that you feel you shouldn't pay t=e amount owed writen or agreed. ( this only happens AFTE= you have 
received the beneifts of course ) 
you then ad= the easily refuted argument that it was Alan's idea. =AO BTW It is and 
would have been super easy for yo= to set a meeting if you had chosen to. you met with brad. =AO there are memos. 
there are emails ( which you choose=not even to look at, for , I can only assume . for the fear that it=is as clear as I 
suggest it is . ). lets assume that i show yo= alan ha= minuscule input,at the very end . way after the fact , no 
invovlem=nt in the crafting of the idea • to a transaction that saved your fa=ily 600 million dollars. or that in fact the 
first hundr=d or the full 175 actually now gets you a benefit that you have been=going on about . . what then ?! will 
there be more reas=ns that appear why agreed amounts should not be paid. or are you sug=esting we going to go 
through this exercise for its amusement value =C2 
3 It seems you have forgotten that you ask=d for my HELP! 
Gigi, Carlyn, audit ,=C2 gift tax audit audit. 8865, 
gagosian contract. =nderpayment of Apollo offshore. tax. now AF and A . - it is wh=lly unfair that after I tell you what I 
will charge , you say , don&=39;t worry _ we always work it out, complete the transaction t= your benefit and then 
and only then you decide not to pay ,=C2 the refrain I never agreed to your emails or=agreed to follow our 
agreement which I unilaterally considerd null and voi= beacuse I did. 
4 Frankly, its Harder to ignore =he fact that after helping you save millions and millions on the Giacomett=. (including 
now for the first time, having to record a 5 million d=llar loss in my trust . you have even forgotten about the lotu= 
flowers you had promised to deliver and have miraculously =A0 not even offered to buy me a lunch . =AO not sure 
what is going on. but it is clearly not the normal you.=C2
