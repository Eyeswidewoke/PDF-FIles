2012 Legislative Session.2 Act 402, which amends La.R.S. § 15:542 provides: ... F. ... (4Xa) 
Any person who was convicted of crime against nature (R.S. 14:89) prior to August 15, 2010, 
may file a motion in the court of conviction to be relieved of the sex offender registration and 
notification requirements of this Chapter if the offense for which the offender was convicted 
would be defined as crime against nature by solicitation (R.S. 14:89.2) had the offender been 
convicted on or after August 15, 2010. Offenders convicted of an offense under the laws of 
another state, or military, territorial, foreign, tribal, or federal law may file a motion in the 
district court of his parish of residence once the administrative procedures of R.S. 15:542.1.3 
have been exhausted and the elements of the offense of conviction have been found to be 
equivalent to the current definition of crime against nature by solicitation (R.S. 14:89.2). The 
provisions of this Subparagraph shall not apply to persons whose conviction for crime against 
nature pursuant to R.S. 14:89 involved the solicitation of a person under the age of seventeen 
and would authorize sentencing of the offender pursuant to R.S. 14:89.2(BX3), had the offender 
been convicted on or after August 15, 2010. (b) The motion shall be accompanied by supporting 
documentation to establish that the person was convicted of crime against nature prior to August 
15, 2010, and 2 Plaintiffs here do not present any allegations regarding Act 402; the Court takes 
judicial notice that the Legislature has amended the Registry Law. 4 that the offense for which 
the offender was convicted would be defined as crime against nature by solicitation (R.S. 
14:89.2) had the offender been convicted on or after August 15, 2010. (c) The district attorney, 
office of state of police, and the Department of Justice, shall be served with a copy of the 
motion. (d) If the supporting documentation described in Subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph is 
provided and meets the requirements of Subparagraph (4Xb), relief shall be granted unless the 
district attorney objects and provides supporting documentation proving that the offense for 
which the person was convicted, and which requires registration and notification pursuant to the 
provisions of this Chapter, involved the solicitation of a person under the age of seventeen. (e) If 
the district attorney proves by clear and convincing evidence that the conviction for crime 
against nature pursuant to R.S. 14:89 involved the solicitation of a person under the age of 
seventeen, the court shall deny the motion to be relieved of the sex offender registration and 
notification requirements as provided by the provisions of this Paragraph. (f) The provisions of 
this Paragraph shall not apply to any person who was convicted of one or more offenses which 
otherwise require registration pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter. La.R.S. 
15:541(FX4X2012)(as amended by Act 402). Accordingly, under Act 402, a person convicted 
of Crime Against Nature by Solicitation may petition a state court for an order removing him or
