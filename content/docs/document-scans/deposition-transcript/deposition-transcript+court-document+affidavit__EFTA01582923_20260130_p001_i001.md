HEADLINE: MAXWELL'S DRINK-DRIVE DAUGHTER GAVE POLICE TEA 
BODY: 
Robert Maxwell's daughter treated tired traffic police to tea and biscuits and a flick through the family photographs at her 
brother's home after she was arrested her for drink-driving, a court was told today. But Ghislaine Maxwell's middle-of-the-night 
hospitality could not save her from a L1.000 fine and a year's driving ban at London's Horseferry Road Court. Miss Maxwell. 34 
whose tycoon father named his private yacht after her, earlier joked with police that she had not had a drink for more than four 
years and was allergic to it - although she was well over the limit at the time, the court heard. She had taken the arresting officers 
to her brother Ian's home in Elvaston Mews, South Kensington, to prove that although she had no fixed address in England, she 
had somewhere to stay. Nazir Afzal, prosecuting, said: "It is fair to say that Miss Maxwell is one of the most co-operative 
customers that Chelsea police station live had. "She took them to her brother's home, made them a cup of tea, showed them some 
family photographs and promised to write to their senior officer to commend them for their hospitality." The officers left satisfied 
that she had a sound address to stay at, said Mr Afzal. Paris-born Miss Maxwell was described on the chareesheet as an Internet 
operator of no fixed address in the UK, although her lawyer said she as a business consultant. She admitted driving a blue E-
registration Volkswagen Golf GT1 with excess alcohol. 
Mr Afzal said she was stopped in Harrington Road, South Kensington. at 4.30am because the car had no headlights on. "She 
said that she was sorry, and at this point police noticed the smell of intoxicating liquor on her breath," said Mr Afzal. "When 
asked when she had her last alcoholic drink, she replied: 'About two minutes ago'." She failed a roadside breath test and was 
arrested. Further tests at the police station show she had an alcohol content of 55 microgrammes, which Mr Afzal said was about 
one-and-a-half times the legal limit. When cautioned, Miss Maxwell allegedly said: "I am allergic to alcohol. I haven't had a 
drink for four-and-a-half years." Mr Afzal added: "The officers didn't take any notice of that and she then apologised." Keith 
Oliver, defending, said: "She had attended a dinner party but in the event, had little to eatand on an empty stomach, drank two or 
three glasses of wine." He described Miss Maxwell as a woman "of moderate means", based in New York, where she had been 
resident for five years. Mr Oliver added that Miss Maxwell had returned to America after being bailed by police and flew back 
to Britain especially for the hearing. Magistrate Anthony Eadie also ordered her to pay L75 costs. Miss Maxwell, smartly 
dressed in a black mini-skin and matching top, with her hair tied back, refused to comment after the hearing. 
Her father's body was found near the yacht named after her in November 1991.
