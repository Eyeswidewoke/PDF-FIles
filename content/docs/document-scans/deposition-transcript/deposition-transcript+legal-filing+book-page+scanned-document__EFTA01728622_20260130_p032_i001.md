Situational-type sex offenders victimizing children do not have a true sexual 
preference for children. They may molest them, however, for a wide variety of 
situational reasons. They are more likely to view and be aroused by adult pornog-
raphy, but might engage in sex with children in certain situations. Situational sex 
offenders frequently molest readily available children they have easy access to 
such as their own or those they may live with or have control over. Pubescent 
teenagers are high-risk, viable sexual targets. Younger children may also be 
targeted because they are weak, vulnerable, or available. Morally indiscriminate 
situational offenders may select children, especially adolescents, simply because 
they have the opportunity and think they can get away with it. Social misfits may 
situationally select child victims out of insecurity and curiosity. Others may have 
low self-esteem and use children as substitutes for preferred adults. 
At the other end of the motivation continuum are the more "preferential" sex 
offenders. Although they can be unintelligent and poor, they tend to be more 
intelligent and more likely from higher socioeconomic groups. Their criminal 
sexual behavior tends to be in the service of deviant sexual needs known as 
paraphilias. This behavior is often persistent and compulsive and is primarily 
fantasy-driven. Their erotic imagery creates and repeated fantasy over time then 
fuels the needs. They are more likely to consider these needs rather than the risks 
involved and therefore make "needy" mistakes that often seem almost stupid. 
When they collect pornography and related paraphernalia, it usually focuses the 
themes of their paraphilic preferences. Their fantasy-driven behavior tends to 
focus not only on general victim characteristics and their entitlement to sex, but 
also on their paraphilic preferences including specific victim preferences; their 
relationship to the victim (i.e., teacher, rescuer, mentor); and their detailed 
scenario (i.e.; education, rescue, journey) (Hazelwood & Warren, 2001). Their crimi-
nal sexual behavior is rooted in their sexual fantasies and need to turn fantasy into 
reality. Their verbal skills are usually high, and they are less likely to use physical 
violence to control victims. They are more likely to have a history of primarily sex 
offenses. Their sex crimes usually stem from a fantasy-fueled and elaborate script 
that is far more detailed and elaborate (i.e., dialogue, exact sequence, clothing) 
than the "plan" of a situational-type sex offender or common criminal. They tend 
to "audition" their potential victims, selecting them primarily based on their simi-
larity to and consistency with that script. There can be a lengthy "rehearsal" or 
grooming process leading up to the victimization. They are more likely to use 
fantasy "props" (i.e., fetish items, costumes, toys) and critique the activity, but 
not necessarily learn from or then modify their criminal sexual behavior. Their 
patterns of behavior are more likely to involve the previously discussed concept 
of ritual. 
As this descriptive term implies, preferential-type sex offenders have specific 
sexual preferences or paraphilias. For instance those with a preference for chil-
dren could be called "pedophiles." Those with a preference for peeping could be 
called voyeurs, and those with a preference for suffering could be called sadists. 
But one of the purposes of this typology is to limit the use of these diagnostic 
terms for investigators and prosecutors. Preferential-type sex offenders are more 
likely to view, be aroused by, and collect theme pornography. A pedophile would 
be just one example or subcategory of a preferential sex offender. A preferential 
sex offender whose sexual preferences do not include children, and is therefore 
not a pedophile, cart still sexually victimize children.
