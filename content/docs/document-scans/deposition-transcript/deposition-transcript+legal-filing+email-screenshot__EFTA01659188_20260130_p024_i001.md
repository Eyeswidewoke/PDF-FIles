NBC Nightly NewsVi (5/5, story 7, 1:50, Holt, 5.3M) reported that state and local law 
enforcement are undertaking a massive effort to help with "the record migrant surge at the 
southern border" and relieve "overworked Border Patrol agents." NBC's Gabe Gutierrez added 
that agents from the Texas Department of Public Safety are "having to patrol more...because 
federal resources are stretched so thin. In March alone, the number of migrant stops at the 
border surge to 172,000 a 20-year high." Gutierrez continued, "Since March, state authorities 
have referred more than 28,000 migrants to the US Border Patrol and seized more than 5,700 
pounds of marijuana and almost 100 pounds of cocaine." 
Asked on MSNBCVi (5/5, 1.38M) about the Administration's response to the surge of 
migrants at the southern border, DHS Secretary Mayorkas said, "We are now a little bit more 
than 30 days after I spoke of the fact we had a plan, and we now no longer have more than 
5,000 unaccompanied children in Border Patrol custody, just over 500. No longer are 
unaccompanied children spending an average of 133 hours in a Border Patrol facility, but rather 
they are spending just less than 25 hours." 
ICE Deportations Fell To Record Low In April. The Washington Post (5/5, Miroff, 
10.52M) reports that "the number of deportations carried out" by ICE last month "fell to the 
lowest monthly level on record," a drop that comes as border crossings "remain at a 20-year 
high, according to the latest enforcement data, obtained by The Washington Post." According to 
the preliminary data, ICE deported 2,962 in April, "the first time the monthly figure has dipped 
below 3,000," and marking "a 20 percent decline from March, when ICE deported 3,716." 
According to the Post, "ICE has recorded about 37,000 deportations" in the last seven months, 
putting it "on pace for fewer than 55,000 deportations for the 2021 fiscal year. It would be the 
first time that figure has fallen below 100,000." 
Cost Of NHS Migrant Shelter Contracts Draw Scrutiny. The AP (5/5, Licon) reports, 
"Confronted with a stream of unaccompanied children crossing the border from Mexico, the U.S. 
government has awarded shelter-construction and management contracts to private companies 
that critics say may not be equipped to adequately care for the minors." According to the AP, 
"In its haste to provide new facilities, [HHSJ awarded the largest contracts - worth more than 
$2 billion - to two companies and a nonprofit without a bidding process and has exempted 
providers from the staffing requirements that state-licensed child facilities must meet." The AP 
adds that "two of the new large facilities have been shuttered in the past few weeks," and HHS 
"did not explain why they were closed so suddenly." 
The Wall Street Journal (5/5, Hackman, Caldwell, Subscription Publication, 8.41M) reports 
that the Administration has opened more than a dozen emergency shelters to house 
unaccompanied minors at the border in the last few weeks, which three officials said are 
serving as a stopgap solution while new licensed shelters are opened. However, some advocates 
have raised concerns that conditions are inadequate for housing children for long periods. 
Administration Reunites Four Separated Migrant Families. ABC World News 
TonightVi (5/5, story 5, 2:25, Muir, 6.42M) reported, "The first migrant families separated 
under the Trump Administration's zero tolerance policy" are now being "reunited under 
President Biden." ABC's Cecilia Vega added, "The Biden Administration says the Trump White 
House left them with little to know information about many of the families. There are still more 
than 400 children whose parents have yet to be located." Vega said four families were reunited 
this week, and "the Administration says more families will be reunited soon." All of the reunited 
families will "receive temporary protected status for humanitarian reasons," though "advocates 
are calling for permanent legal protection." NBC Nightly NewsVi (5/5, story 8, 0:20, Holt, 5.3M) 
also reported briefly on the reunions. 
Mayorkas Says DHS Probe Will "Root Out" Domestic Extremists Internally. 
Asked on MSNBCVi (5/5, 1.38M) about an investigation into extremism within his department, 
DHS Secretary Mayorkas said, "I identified from the outset that the most significant terrorism-
