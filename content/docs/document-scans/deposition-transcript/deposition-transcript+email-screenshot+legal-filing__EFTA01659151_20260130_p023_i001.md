they would get a coronavirus vaccine," compared with 63% of Latinos and 61% of white people, 
"according to a December report from the Pew Research Center." The Post adds, "Many Black 
people say they do not trust the medical establishment because of glaring inequities in modern-
day care and historical examples of mistreatment." Such "deep-seated skepticism has led to a 
burst of confidence-building efforts across the country, some led by the nation's top Black 
doctors and scientists and funded by the U.S. government." 
US Sees Increase In Underage Migrants Testing Positive For Coronavirus. 
The Washington Post (12/7, Sacchetti, 14.2M) reports the number of unaccompanied migrant 
children who have been "testing positive for the coronavirus has jumped more than 35 percent 
in recent weeks as federal officials prepare for the possibility of a new immigration surge at the 
U.S.-Mexico border." The Post adds, "A total of 1,061 minors in U.S. immigration custody have 
tested positive since March, up from 781 cases in mid-November, according to federal records." 
However, the Post reports none of the minors "have been hospitalized, and most have 
recovered and have been released," according to an Office of Refugee Resettlement spokesman. 
Administration Officials Divided Over Wisdom Of California Lockdown. 
In the lead NBC Nightly NewsVi (12/7, lead story, 2:25, Holt, 6.35M) story, Miguel Almaguer 
reported that "with more businesses closed in California recording a record 34,000 infections in 
a single day, leading authorities are relaying mixed messages over the state's lockdown." NIAID 
Director Fauci: "When you have a challenge to the healthcare system, you have got to do 
something like that." Assistant HHS Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir: "I think we could be 
causing a lot more harm by causing overly restrictive recommendations." 
Giroir said on Fox News' America's Newsroom (12/7, 896K), "What really breaks my heart 
is that I don't know of any data that says you need to shut down outdoor dining or outdoor 
bars. We really wanted to limit the indoor crowded places. So, I think we need to do what's 
necessary to turn the pandemic but not more that's not evidence-based that is going to be 
counterproductive." Giroir added, "We do, if you are in a surge place, need to limit indoor dining 
and indoor bars. You don't have to close schools. You don't have to close universities. You don't 
have to close your major industries. You do need to wear a mask. That's critically important 
when you are in public and can't physically distance, very, very important." 
Surgeon General Adams said on Fox News' The Story (12/7), "We know that it is safe to 
keep schools open in general, when you take precautions. We know that outside is better than 
inside and that if you close down people's ability to congregate in an outdoor area, they are just 
going to run inside and the virus will spread. So, I think we need to be more intelligent, more 
strategic about some of these closures, and we are going to try to give states and health 
departments better advice. But to the people out there, I would say you still have to comply. 
You've still got to use common sense." 
While Politico (12/7, Yamamura, 4.29M) reports California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has 
"framed the state's stay-at-home order as necessary to ensure hospitals can handle an 
expected surge in hospitalizations in coming weeks," the AP (12/7, Gecker, Pedroncelli) reports 
that "outside California's big cities, especially in conservative areas, the backlash against tough 
new restrictions is growing, and some sheriffs say they won't enforce health orders." 
However, the New York Times (12/7, Fuller, Cowan, Tompkins, 18.61M) reports California 
"is averaging 21,000 new known cases a day, twice as many as the state was reporting at its 
worst point this summer and by far its highest levels of the pandemic." The Times says that for 
the state, "the overarching story throughout the pandemic has been of a state that by dint of 
its population has huge numbers of cases. On a per capita basis California has fewer cases than 
40 other states, but its overall numbers are jarring: 1.3 million and counting." Bloomberg
(12/7, 4.73M) says California "reported 24,735 new cases Monday, a day after shattering 
records with more than 30,000 daily infections."
