meeting, where Mr. Black was present, he raised the concern that you now voice. Mr. Black and 
I did not have a chance to discuss the issue, but I had already conceived of a way to resolve that 
issue if it were raised during negotiations. As I stated, it was not, leading me to believe that it was 
not a matter of concern to the defense. Since the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the 
agents and I have vetted the list of victims more than once. In one instance, we decided to remove 
a name because, although the minor victim was touched inappropriately by Mr. Epstein, we decided 
that the link to a payment was insufficient to call it "prostitution." I have always remained open to 
a challenge to the list, so your suggestion that Mr. Epstein was forced to write a blank check is 
simply unfounded. 
Your last set of allegations relates to the investigation of the matter. For instance, you claim 
that some of the victims were informed of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough 
investigation of their allegations against Mr. Epstein. This also is false. None of the victims was 
informed of the right to sue under Section 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three 
victims were notified shortly after the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement of the general 
terms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim notification, and no further 
notifications were done. Throughout this process you have seen that I have prepared this rase as 
though it would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility of damages claims prior 
to concluding the matter by plea or trial would only undermine my case. If my reassurances are 
insufficient, the fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein should assure you of 
the integrity of the investigation.'

I contacted her attorney — who was paid for by Mr. Epstein and 
was directed by counsel for Mr. Epstein to demand immunity — and asked only whether he still

and if he wanted me to send the victim notification letter to him. He asked 
what the letter would say and I told him that the letter would be forthcoming in about a week and 
that I could not provide him with the terms. With respect to 
status as a victim, you 
again want us to accept as true only facts that are beneficial to your client and to reject as false 
anything detrimental to him. 
made a number of statements that are contradicted by 
documentary evidence and a review of her recorded statement shows her lack of credibility with 
respect to a number of statements. Based upon all of the evidence collected, 
is classified 
as a victim as defined by statute. Of course, that does not mean that 
considers herself 
a victim or that she would seek damages from Mr. Epstein. I believe that a number of the identified 
victims will not seek damages, but that does not negate their legal status as victims. 
I understand that you and your co-counsel perceive a strategic advantage to removing me 
from the case, and that perhaps my willingness to allow others to speak for me emboldened your 
'There are numerous other unfounded allegations in your letter about document demands, 
the money laundering investigation, contacting potential witnesses, speaking with the press, and the 
like. These allegations have been raised and disproven earlier and need not be readdressed.
