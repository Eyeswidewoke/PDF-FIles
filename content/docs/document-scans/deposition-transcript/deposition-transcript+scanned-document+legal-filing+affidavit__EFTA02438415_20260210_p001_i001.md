RE: 
First I want to express my gratefulness for remarks you've gave it to me. I work hard to break the ice I've lived in 
and danced in...I do admit, it is not easy...I have to think about completely different style and motions they teach 
me in the conservatoire and in the same time dance as a wind! "Open" as you told! I am trying to move widely 
with my look up! oh, Dear Jeffrey, I have so much to do in the class and in my life! I am so appreciate that you 
guiding me on my journey. 
As you know I didn't know exactly where I was going, but the conservatoire seems much better as we thought... 
that place is the second school after opera de Paris school! The masters of dance are very famous dancers. 
I am just very lucky! I have the best chance to learn from the bests! the moment when I get the opportunity to 
make some pictures I will send to you right the way! The studios are huge, beautiful! Jeffrey in the ballet class they 
play piano and violin! Alive music! That's so wonderful... so I attend ballet, Alterie, Contemporary, repertoire 
classes...it is exact school I needed to be at that moment. 
Recently I feel weak...there arc almost tree weeks I have a flue. its my fault, because I don't eat enough food which 
helps my body to be strong. But that's the student life! To buy at bargain...But today I went in the pharmacy to get 
some vitamins otherwise people won't stop asking what's wrong with me! Feels like I've used all the energy I had! 
Honestly I look ugly like never before! I think is also tension. anxiety...Definitely I couldn't avoid maladies...my 
packed which I sent from Lithuania to Lyon with all the things I needed, was picked and just taken. I was so 
upset...I am missing my new point shoes, honey, new boots, tempox ( unbelievable! who needs tempox! )and many 
other things which I bought... I know it is just the things, but still...I paid for that... how people can take 
something what do not belong to them! I claim for compensation...i wrote a letter telling what I am missing, but I 
haven't got the answer yet from a company which was responsible for my package. 
The other worry was my family...my mum and brother got very sick...i was worried a lot...then Miguel 'woke uo' 
Valdas got crazy... all the dramas came a long my way! I've just realized is enough to go deep into relationships 
till I know what I want to do! Men always come and leave...first me, then relationship! I amok to have someone 
who calls me, dates me, but nothing serious, I am so tired of thinking about relationship! I need more freedom and 
independents! 
At the moment I am looking for French course I could attend...but the once I've found seems not for my 
pocket...I am planning to stay in Lyon for a second semester. I am not sure yet if it's possible...I will see! If I am 
able to stay I have to work! Surely, is very important to me be involved in French course. Pity, that my 
conservatoire do not provide French courses for the forage students. 
Last weekend I was in Geneva! One more time I realized that is the place I would love to live and work! I spent 
all the weekend with Kathy at her beautiful house (if you are interested to know who she is, then google Kathy Lee 
Brynner) Wonderful Woman! My second Mum! It was like a therapy for me spend sometime with her! 
Conversation, food, cinema, sauna, mountains... 
Beside that I do have friends here; we go to the concerts, performances!There are so much to see and do! But 
sometimes I feel like staying in my bed...read a book, listen music...weariness takes the top! 
Well that's what I do.
