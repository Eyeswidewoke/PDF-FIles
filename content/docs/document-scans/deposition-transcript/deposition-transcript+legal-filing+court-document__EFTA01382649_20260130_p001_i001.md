Transaction and processing service fees revenue decreased 1% during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period 
in 2014 as growth in our North America, EMEA, and LATAM regions was more than offset by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. North 
America revenue growth was driven by net pricing growth resulting in an increase of approximately $25 million, which includes a timing benefit 
resulting from certain fee increases which only impacted the first quarter of 2015, partially offset by an incentive payment received during 2014 
and a decline in volume of approximately $10 million. On a constant currency basis growth in our EMEA and LATAM regions was driven by 
volume growth of approximately $25 million and margin improvement of approximately $15 million which were more than offset by the impact of 
a strong U.S. dollar which negatively impacted revenue growth in our international regions. 
North America transaction growth in the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2014 was driven by growth in our distribution 
systems. International transaction growth in the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2014 outpaced revenue growth due to changes in 
transaction mix and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements.

Product sales and other revenue increased 12% during the six months ended June 30. 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. due to 
a $32 million growth in equipment sales and a $18 million increase in software sales. Equipment sales increased as our clients continue to adopt 
our Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) solutions. Software sales increased as a result of investments in our merchant suite of products. Foreign 
currency exchange rate movements negatively impacted the growth rate for product sales and other revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2015 
compared to the same period in 2014 by 5 percentage points. 
Global Business Solutions Segment EBITI11 decreased 3% during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 
2014 driven by the revenue items noted above offset by higher expenses, due to product investment costs to support our new line of products such 
as Clover and Perka and sales and marketing costs to deliver solutions to our clients of $42 million, as well as further investments in Brazil and in 
our international sales force of $16 million on a constant currency boats. In addition, during the six months ended June 30. 2014. we ateived the 
benefit of a combined $17 million goods and services tax recovery in Australia and a gain on the revaluation of settlement funds associated with the 
devaluation of the Argentinian peso.
