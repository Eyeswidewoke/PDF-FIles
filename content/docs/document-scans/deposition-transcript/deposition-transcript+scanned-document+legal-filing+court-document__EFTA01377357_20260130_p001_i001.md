selling up to 1 3340. There really isn't much due out of brexit until the EU summit on the 19'h of October so 
actively trade the cross from the long side.

112 breached briefly yesterday as the fixed income market reopens post NFP / N Korea Friday. With CPIs approaching at 
the end of the week, it's hard to commit to either direction and we trade small ranges. With big moving averages below, 
it may not be prudent to sell in the hole — with Fridays data in essence potentially dictating the medium term direction 
of the USD pair, we hold to wait. In the meantime, we respect the ranges from 111.90 -113.40 and the same holds for 
the EUR cross with 131.85 -132.85 respected for now. 
AUD, NZD (Greg Fiori) 
AUDUSD:

Resistance 7810 
Resistance: .7146 (200 dma) 
AUD-NZD- Audusd getting a relief rally off post NFP lows of .7833 as recent Usd strength is failing to sustain 
further gains. Favor higher price action in Euraud as long as 1.51 holds and selling Audusd back above .7800. 
Bearish bias remains in Nzd and feeling like any rallies will be hard to come by given ongoing political saga. 
The outlier risk is that NZ coalition negotiations won't be concluded by the deadline of 12 Oct that NZ First leader 
Peters has set and that he could then elect to sit on the cross benches.

USDCAD has spent some time below 1.2500 the last two days, but has remained resilient above it. To me, this is shaping 
up as a transition week where the market will spend its time searching for the next major theme to grip ahold of. Over a 
more multi week horizon, I continue to like a weaker CAD as the market continues to adjust curve pricing to a more 
dovish BOC. However, for the time being, CAD is a slave to the general USD trend (or lack thereof). So what does that 
mean?....range trading! Broadly speaking, I'll abide by the 1.2500-1.2600 range of the last three trading sessions until 
an impetus to alter that plan arises. On the economic front, we have Canadian housing starts and building permit data 
this morning.

USDCHF - Support: 0.9655 (100DIvIA), 0.9637 (38.2% of Sept advance)

Resistance: 0.9836 
Resistance: 1.1623(22/09 
USDCHF held the important 200 day moving average at .9836 we have been highlighting and closed the week with 
waning momentum. We like to sell rallies ahead of this level, but would likely flip to a long USD position were a 
convincing break occur. EURCHF, on the other hand, has been able to maintain the bid tone it has enjoyed since the 
start of summer. We continue to look for areas to buy dips in the pair, but will reassess on a close below 1.1385
