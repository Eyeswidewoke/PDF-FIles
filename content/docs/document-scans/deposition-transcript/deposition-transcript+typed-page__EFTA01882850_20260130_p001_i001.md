ALTERNATIVES TO 
CUSTODIAL SENTENCING 
There has been considerable recent debate about 
overcrowding in UK prisons. The system is struggling to 
accommodate the growing number of young offenders 
being given custodial sentences. This POSTnote sets 
out the scale of the problem and looks at recent trends 
in sentencing, with a particular focus on young 
offenders. It examines the factors linked with offending 
and asks whether better understanding of these can be 
used to target early actions aimed at deterring young 
people from offending. Finally, the note examines 
alternatives to custodial sentencing and assesses how 
successful these have been in practice. 
Background 
Trends in sentencing 
Courts have a range of options open to them when 
sentencing offenders (Table 1). These include: 
• Custodial sentences in prisons, detention centres, 
young offender institutions, secure training centres, or 
secure children's homes. While the number of 
offenders sentenced through the courts in England and 
Wales declined between 1996-06, the proportion 
given custodial sentences increased (from 5.9-6.8%). 
• Community sentences. As detailed later, a wider 
range of community sentences have been introduced 
in the last few years. Since 1996, the overall number 
of community sentences given by the courts has risen, 
particularly for young offenders aged 10-17 (Table 1). 
• Fines and other measures (such as conditional or 
absolute discharges or guardianship orders). The 
number and proportion of offenders given such 
sentences has declined since 1996. 
The prison population 
The rise in custodial sentencing has resulted in 
considerable pressure on the prison estate, which is 
currently running very close to full capacity. According to

the National Offenders Management Service (NOMS) on 
the 9th May 2008, the total population in custody (male 
and female) was 82,323.2 At the same time, NOMS 
estimates the total useable operational capacity of the 
UK prison estate to be 82,949. This is defined as the 
sum capacity of all establishments on the estate minus 
1,700 places to make allowance for operating margins 
such as the need to provide separate housing for males 
and females, different categories of prisoners, etc. 
A substantial proportion of those in custody are young 
men: on 31/12/2007, the prison population comprised: 
• 2,188 15-17 year olds, 2,128 of whom were male; 
• 9,220 18-20 years olds, 8,790 of whom were male; 
• 68,081 adults (21+), 64,242 of whom were male. 
The govemment has increased prison places by nearly 
20,000 since 1997 and has begun a new building 
programme to deliver an additional 8,000 by 2012. 
Lord Carter's Review of Prisons recommended in 
December 2007 that a further 6,500 new places would 
be needed by 2012? It also advised changes to 
sentencing legislation to encourage use of alternative 
remedies for some low risk offenders and offences, in line 
with the government's strategy for reserving custody for 
the most serious and dangerous offenders.
