Even in science, timing is everything. Charles Babbage' programmable =omputer was, in 1837, a step—or two—too 
early. Influential ideas =re those that are novel but just familiar enough that existing =esearchers can build on them. 
Stuart Kauffman coined the term "adjacent =ossible" to describe the untapped potential that sits only one step =way 
where scientists currently sit. Scientists who open the adjacent =ossible deserve the research equivalent of an "assist" in 
sports....

Daniel Kahneman has not yet influenced my work on snails and mice, but I =m only in an early point in my career and I 
still look forward to =xploring his ideas in a molecular biological context in the future. . = . 
MICHAEL NORTON 
Danny Kahneman sets a nearly impossible standard for social scientists: =esign experiments that so perfectly (and 
subtly) capture two different =ersions of the world that you don't even need to see the results to =ave already learned 
something novel....

The Problem of Multiple Counterfactuals 
Here is an insight Danny K. triggered and changed the course of my work. = figured out a nontrivial problem in 
randomness and its underestimation = decade ago while reading the following sentence in a paper by Kahneman =nd 
Miller of 1986: .. . 
JOSHUA GREENE 
It's hard to overstate Kahneman's influence on my work. What I have =one, essentially, is to look at moral thinking 
through the lenses =round by Daniel Kahneman. In my first year of college I was introduced =o the field of "heuristics 
and biases" and was struck by the power of =hese ideas—that some of the most important decisions we make are 
=eeply myopic. Soon after, I was introduced to contemporary debates in =thics, much of which center around moral 
dilemmas such as the Trolley =roblem. . . .

"Answering an Easier Question" 
I have known Danny Kahneman for more than 40 years, and am taking the =iberty of bypassing the editorial instructions 
to avoid the personal =nd will mention how we first met. From my brief time as chair of the =tanford Psychology 
Department in the 1970s I recall two achievements: a =ew paint job and hiring Amos Tversky. Amos in turn brought 
Danny often =nto the Tversky's campus home. Some of my most treasured memories of =hat time were watching them 
thinking, talking, and laughing when they =ere at the height of their collaboration. Since then, I have avidly =bsorbed 
Danny's work, and enjoyed every conversation we have had. It =as all influenced my own thinking, not only about our 
science, but =bout how to try to do it right.... 
STEVEN PINKER 
As many Edge readers know, my recent work has involved presenting =opious data indicating that rates of violence have 
fallen over the =ears, decades, and centuries, including the number of annual deaths in =ar, terrorism, and homicide. 
Most people find this claim incredible on =he face of it. Why the discrepancy between data and belief? The answer
