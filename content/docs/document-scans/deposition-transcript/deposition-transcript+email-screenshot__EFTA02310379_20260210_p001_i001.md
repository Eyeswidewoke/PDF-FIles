Re: 
All sounds ok. I will be around on the 12th to meet and then we can =egin demolition. The majority of the work will be 
replicating what you =ave in 14G. Please let m know about the kitchen cabinets. We have =een using the IKEA white 
kitchens ( go see 4H ) and let me know if this =ould work for you? They have numerous other options in stock. We 
=ould do a W/D as well as a dishwasher ( see 4H) layout. The =efrigerator is 28" deep and 35" wide also from IKEA ( with 
ice maker =nd water dispenser) Used it a few times and have had no problems. All =his is on IKEAs website. No problem 
to move the bathroom fixtures from =4G to 11J ( we may need to order a new shower body however) Will you be 
=liminating the tub in 11J?

them to be. I'd like to do the =ame baseboards as 2G. I have all the tiles and finishes in mind for the =athroom and 
kitchen already. The kitchen I'd like the same layout, but =ossibly different color scheme.l'd like to put in the 
washer/dryer unit =nstead of a dishwasher. I have a whole list of things I have done to =y apt that I would like to 
replicate: I have double thick windows in =he bedroom for sound insulation, track lighting on the ceiling in =edroom and 
living room. If possible, I'd like to put a ceiling fan in =he bedroom. Light plank hardwood floors(I'm sourcing now) 
venetian =laster on all the walls(l will have the same guy do 11J as did 14G) =isal carpet in bedroom(same as the one I 
have now), I had my own guy =ake a very nice radiator cover in the living room with drawers which I =ill have him do the 
same for 11J in living room and bedroom. That would =e great to have the bathroom fixtures moved to new apt; will 
that work =ith the valves, etc? The brand is Dorn Braht.

but it seems =very apt is a bit different and can't say for sure what should be done =ill seeing it. 
> In the meantime, I will confirm the wood floor and bedroom carpet =hoices as well as the kitchen cabinets and tiles 
and bathroom tiles =opefully by the end of this week.
