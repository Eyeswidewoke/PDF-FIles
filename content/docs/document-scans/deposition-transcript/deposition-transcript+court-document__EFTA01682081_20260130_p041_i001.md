Alan Dershowitz Memos re. Meetings/ Phone Conversations with 
May 19: Memo Dictated to Maura Kelly/ Sarah Neely 
Memorandum of meeting with 
Stone at 8:45 to 9:40AM at Sherry 
Netherland Hotel on May 19, 2015 
Less than 5 minutes ago I completed nearly an hour long meetin with the above and I 
am recording my contemporary recollection of what was sai 
ld me that he was 
very much upset at the fact that my name w included in the 
eral pleading. He said it 
was wrong and a self-inflicted wound by 
and her lawyers to name names, 
including mine. He said that had he been ask 
in advance he would have strongly 
pi
opposed the inclusion of names. He said he was now convinced that 
was 
mistaken in naming me as someone with whom she had sex. He said at it was his 
obligation to try to persuade her to acknowledge that I could not have been among the 
people with whom she had sex. He said that if he failed to persuade her of that, he would 
leave her representation to Edwards and Scarolo and no longer represent her. 
He said that although he is always reluctant to drop a client, especially in a pro bono case, 
he would feel comfortable doing that in this case because she is adequately represented 
by her two other lawyers. He told me that he would have never taken this case if he knew 
illid
that she would name me and t 
grets having taken the case. He said that it would 
be a win-win both for me, for 
and for "truth and justice" were she to now 
acknowledge that she made a mistake in including me. He said he is convinced that I did 
not and could not have had sex with her. 
He also told me that 
told him she had sex with another prominent individual who 
he did not name. He said he had spoken to the individual and was now convinced that he 
too did not have sex with her. He thinks that as a young impressionable girl, she was 
totally confused about who it was she was having sex with. He persuaded her not to 
publicly identify this man, and so far she has accepted his advice. He said he wished he 
had had the opportunity to talk to me as well in advance of my being named and that he is 
confident that he could have persuaded her not to name me. 
He proposed the 
in wa of going forward. He would like me to bring my timeline 
gaggiafiTh to him, 
and to 
in an effort to persuade 
that I could not have been at the places where she claims to have had sex with 
me. He hopes that when she sees my evidence she will acknowledge that she made a 
mistake. He said it won't be easy for her to do that, but that it would be the best thing for 
her and her case to acknowledge her mistake. Again he repeated that if she refuses to do 
that, he could not ethically continue to represent her and would leave the matter to the 
other two lawyers. I gave him my schedule of available dates over the next month.
