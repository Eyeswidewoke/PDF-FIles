To refresh your memory, let me repeat again w=at was happening with my IRA until I learned about it. 
There is a ma=datory withdrawal. Half was being distributed to family. The other half was being used for taxes and 
management fees for the entire=estate. In order to pay 
medical expenses, and to pay $50,=00 a year for rent and 
upkeep on the house in Wellfleet that we had given =o the children and that I was barely using, I had to withdraw extra 
funds from the IRA, with the onerous tax burden.=C2* The same when I withdrew something to live on. Under these 
cir=umstances, Harry refused to release funds from the Trust for tax relief wi=hout onerous and humiliating conditions 
that he knew I would not accept. Easy to predict what might happen under =ess extreme conditions. It was not until 
2017 that I was able to ove=come the accumulated burden of these actions. 
=/div> 
<=iv dir="ltr"> 
In the previous paragraph you offer to "refresh my mem=ry" and in the prior paragraph you say "You 
recall, I pres=me 
". Without going into detail, I have to note th=t my recollection of the events you describe is not 
consistent with yours (though it may not be ent=rely consistent with Harry's either — I am not sure).4>=A0 
In my case it is not recollections. When I bega= to understand what was happening, I looked into the 
matter, and have the =ocuments at hand, including the mail interchanges about Harry's refusa=. The rest is 
straightforward and unambiguous documents.<=span> 
Since my own recollections m=y be the subject of testimony in the legal proceeding that Harry has 
initi=ted, or in one that you may commence, I think it better that I not recite my own recollections her=. 
Note that Harry's exhibit B, beginning wi=h section 9, is utterly false, and consciously so. All of the above 
has be=n explained to him over and over. It is not only consciously false, but is framed as a vicious and ugly attack on 
Valeria, implicitly a=cusing her of responsibility for the escalation of expenses which, as Harr= knows, was caused by the 
actions just described once again.=span style="font-size:11.0ptfont-family:"Calibri","sans-=erif";color:#1f497d"> 
=/div> 
For such reasons, Harry's proposal is, as=I said, too outrageous to discuss. 
2. 
As you know, Harry's attorney has=commenced a legal action that is intended to facilitate my 
resignation and=the appointment of a successor trustee to take my place. Since you've wanted me removed for some 
time and since I've said=(from the first time you and I met) that I only wanted to serve as trustee=if all the family 
members wanted me to serve, I'm looking forward =o resigning as soon as the court determines how I am to do so and 
how my successor is to be selected. =/u> 
3. 
Given that my replacement is impending, i= might be worth waiting until my successor is in place 
before responding t= my requests for financial disclosure, as it's possible that my successor won't share my views as to 
what the trustee of t=e trusts needs to know before making decisions about distributions. =ikewise, if my successor will 
be identified soon it might make sense for m= to hold off on any distributions and leave it to the new trustee to work 
with you on figuring all of this out. =n this regard I'm kind of a "lame duck" trustee, w=uldn't you say? 
4. 
To the extent that you want to push forwa=d while I remain the trustee, let me again state the 
basis for financial d=sclosure by you. It is that, as trustee, I owe a duty to you and I owe a duty to your children (as the 
remainder beneficiaries o= the trusts). For the present my primary duty is to you and it is to=distribute to you all income 
earned by the trusts, net of expenses,=u> 
Until=l asked about the matter recently, I am aware of no income distributed to me earned from the 
trusts. I cannot be sure, because I have no re=ord of having received any accounting of what is happening to the trusts,
