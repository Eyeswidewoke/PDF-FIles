Note that Harry's exhibit B, beginning =ith section 9, is utterly false, and consciously so. All of the above 
=as been explained to him over and over. It is not only consciously false, but is framed as a vicious and ugly attack on 
Valeria, =mplicitly accusing her of responsibility for the escalation of expenses =hich, as Harry knows, was caused by the 
actions just described once =gain. 
For such reasons, Harry's proposal is, =s I said, too outrageous to discuss. 
2. 
As you know, Harry's attorney =as commenced a legal action that is intended to facilitate my 
=esignation and the appointment of a successor trustee to take my =lace. Since you've wanted me removed for some 
time and since I've =aid (from the first time you and I met) that I only wanted to serve as =rustee if all the family 
members wanted me to serve, I'm =ooking forward to resigning as soon as the court determines how I am to do so and 
how my successor is to be selected. 
3. 
Given that my replacement is impending, =t might be worth waiting until my successor is in place 
before =esponding to my requests for financial disclosure, as it's =ossible that my successor won't share my views as to 
what the trustee =f the trusts needs to know before making decisions about =istributions. Likewise, if my successor will 
be identified soon =t might make sense for me to hold off on any distributions and leave it to the new trustee to work 
with you on figuring all of this =ut. In this regard I'm kind of a "lame duck"=trustee, wouldn't you say? 
4. 
To the extent that you want to push =orward while I remain the trustee, let me again state the 
basis for =inancial disclosure by you. It is that, as trustee, I owe a duty to you and I owe a duty to your children (as the 
remainder =eneficiaries of the trusts). For the present my primary duty is =o you and it is to distribute to you all income 
earned by the trusts, =et of expenses, 
Until I asked about =he matter recently, I am aware of no income distributed to me earned from the 
trusts. I cannot be sure, because I have no =ecord of having received any accounting of what is happening to the =rusts, 
including distributions to others (or as required, to me). =ould you then please send me the records on these matters 
since 2009, when I appointed Harry to replace me as =rustee. 
=/span> 
I provided reports on income, expenses and =istributions to Deborah Pechet Quinan last October and I 
copied those reports to Richard (and updated them) in the last 60 days. I =hink it might be easiest if Richard forwarded 
those reports to you, but =f he can't for some reason then I will do so when I am back in =y office. 
I =ould like to know more about this. Richard Kahn did forward reports to =e, but all that I see is from 
the last few years, after I requested =nformation. I don't have any records for the years since 2009, =hen I appointed 
Harry trustee, neither about the income that was =upposed to be paid to me or about distributions from the Trust or 
any =ccounting of those years. So =ould you send them to both of us, along with documentation about any =istributions 
that were made. In particular, I would like to know =he reason why there is virtually no income from the trust --
whether it =as paid to me from 2009 or not. And about the instructions for =ny distributions that may have been made 
from the Trust.
