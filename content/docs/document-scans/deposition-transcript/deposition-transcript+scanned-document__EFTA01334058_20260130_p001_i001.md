PROBED POL'S SON BLAMES PLOT 
New York Post. New York, N.Y.: Jan 14, 2005. pg. 014 
Abstract (Document Summary) 
IS billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein making a bid for IMG Models? As we reported last summer, Epstein tried 
to buy Elite Models when the bankrupt agency was auctioned off. In 2003, we reported that Epstein, who's been 
described as "a connoisseur of beautiful women," was talking to Karin Models owner Jean-Luc Brunel about 
doing a deal, but it went nowhere. Epstein has also met with Elite's Gerald Marie and 1 Management's Scott 
Lipps. Now we hear Epstein has been having talks with fellow billionaire Teddy Forstmann, who paid $750 
million for the IMG group a few months ago, about buying the company's modeling division, which reps the likes 
of Gisele Bundchen, Kate Moss and Heidi Klum. Reps for IMG and Forstmann deny any such negotiations are 
taking place. Epstein's rep did not return calls. Forstmann has been talking to top Hollywood talent agencies 
about a possible merger. 
PAUL Allen, 51, the bachelor Microsoft co-founder worth $20 billion (according to Forbes), rang in the New Year 
with British blonde Kate Reardon, 36 (above), a former fashion director for Tatter magazine who now writes 
about jewelry for the Times of London. The couple ushered in 2005 in St. Bans aboard Allen's 413- foot yacht, 
"Octopus? equipped with two helicopters and a 60-foot submarine. There were scores of other guests but Allen 
seemed mesmerized by Reardon, who had a similareffect on another billionaire, Sir Jimmy Goldsmith. Reardon 
attended Goldsmith's funeral in 1997, along with his widow and his second wife. "Conveniently, Allen has a 
house In London," said our source. 
[TRUMAN CAPOTE], dead for over 20 years, is suddenly a hot property in Hollywood. The author of "Breakfast 
at Tiffany's" and "In Cold Blood" is the subject of two new biopics - Warner Independent's "Every Word Is True," 
based on George Plimpton's 1997 oral history, and United Artists' "Capote," based on the landmark 1988 Gerald 
Clarke biography. "Capote? due out this fall, stars Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who is talented but a bit burly to 
play the "tiny terror." "Every Word" stars relatively unknown Toby Jones with an all-star supporting cast including 
Alan Cumming, Anjelica Huston, Sandra Bullock (as "To Kill a Mockingbird" author Harper Lee), Ashley Judd, 
Kevin Kline, Gwyneth Paltrow and Sigoumey Weaver. Hollywood columnist Jeffrey Wells reports that "Capote" 
has the advantage of Hoffman in the staning role, while "Every Word," which just started filming, is said to have 
a much better screenplay.

THE loose-cannon son of a subpoenaed Bronx state senator claims Republicans are behind a federal probe of 
the Bronx Democratic machine because they want to destroy Fernando Ferrer's campaign for mayor. 
Efrain Gonzalez III, whose dad, State Sen. Efrain Gonzalez Jr., is one of nine Bronx politicians subpoenaed to 
testify, wrote to the Riverdale Review: "The GOP controls the White House, the N.Y. State House and City Hall, 
so if they want to attack the members of the Bronx Democratic Party, who is going to stop them?" Fifteen 
subpoenas reportedly have been served, six of them to nonprofit organizations that employ relatives of the 
elected officials. Young Gonzalez is president of the Latino Affirmation Council, which isn't listed in The Bronx or 
Manhattan. 
Gonzalez 
letter to the Riverdale paper said: "Wien my father and the 14 other members were issued 
subpoenas, that alone was a message being sent by the GOP, that they will do anything in their power to keep 
Mayor Bloomberg in power, because all those members being probed are working to support Ferrer in next 
years mayoral race." 
The elder Gonzalez's lawyer, "Don't Worry Murray" Richman, told PAGE SIX: "This is the over-excited 
imagination of a young man. We do not support these allegations which were not authorized and don't represent 
the views of the senator or myself." 
In a strange e-mail posted on YonkersTribune.com last fall, after The Post broke the news of the investigation, 
young Gonzalez said: "They couldn't find any weapons [of mass destruction], so they said instead of killing more
