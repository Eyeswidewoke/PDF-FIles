FIRST DATA CORPORATION 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note I: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Business Description 
First Data Corporation (FDC or the Company) is a global provider of electronic comma= and payment solutions for merchants, 
financial institutions, and card issuers. The services the Company provides include merchant transaction processing and acquiring; credit, retail, 
and debit card issuing and processing: prepaid services; and check verification, settlement and guarantee services. 
Consolidation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of FIX include the accounts of FDC and its controlled subsidiaries. All significant 
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies are accounted for under the 
equity method and arc included in "Investment in affiliates- in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company generally utilizes the 
equity method of accounting when it has an ownership interest of between 20% and 50% in an entity, provided the Company is able to exercise 
significant influence over the investee's operations. 
The Company consolidates an entity's financial statements when the Company has a controlling financial interest in the entity. Control 
is normally established when ownership interests exceed 50% in an entity; however, when the Company does not exercise control over a majority-
owned entity as a result of other investors having rights over the management and operations of the entity, the Company accounts for the (unity 
under the equity method. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no greater-than-50%-owned affiliates whose financial statements were not 
consolidated. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Correction of Error 
The Company reviewed the application of debt modifications and extinguishments guidance and determined that it inappropriately 
accounted for certain debt refinancings in 2014. 2013. and 2012. The Company concluded that the correction of the errors was immaterial to any of 
its previously issued annual or interim financial statements. The Company revised its consolidated financial statements to correct the effect of these 
immaterial errors for the corresponding periods. See further discussion in the Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements section of Note 6 
"Borrowings" in these consolidated financial statements.
