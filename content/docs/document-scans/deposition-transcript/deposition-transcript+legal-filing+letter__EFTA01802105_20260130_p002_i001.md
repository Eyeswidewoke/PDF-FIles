Harvard professor George Whitesides <http://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/content.php?page=gwhitesides> has spent his 
career solving problems in science and =ndustry—he cofounded the pharmaceutical giant Genzyme, and he's the =orld's 
most cited living chemist. And yet Whitesides often reflects as muc= on problems that haven't been solved as on his 
successes. He recently spoke to Technology Review's Conor=Myhrvold on the challenge of problem solving, and on how 
better communication between s=ientists and the general public could help address some of the many problems worth 
solving. 
Technology Review: =hat's the problem you have most wanted to solve and haven't been able to?<=span> 
Whitesides: There's an intellectual problem, which is the o=igin of life. The origin of life has the characteristic that 
there's somet=ing in there as a chemist, which I just don't understand. I don't understand how you go from a system 
that's random chemicals to som=thing that becomes, in a sense, a Darwinian set of reactions that are gett=ng more 
complicated spontaneously. I just don't understand how that works.=So that's a scientific problem. 
There's a second class of probl=m, which is how do you do university-based research in a such a way and in=such an 
environment that it eventually gets to be real? And that's the problem that we're working on with paper diagnostics (see 
&=uot;TR10: Paper Diagnostics <http://www.technologyreview.com/article/412187/ft10-paper-d=agnosticsh ") and 
diagnostics for all and=the entire low-cost diagnostics area (see "Lab-on-a-Chip Made of Paper 
<http://www.tech=ologyreview.com/news/410126/lab-on-a-chip-made-of-paperk " and "Diagnosing Disease =ith 
Paper and Tape <http://www.technologyreview.c=m/news/411324/diagnosing-disease-with-paper-and-tapeh "). And 
it's not that we don't know how to do i=, but we haven't done it yet. And universities in the United States are incredibly 
strong, developed industry is incredibly =trong, but there's really a gap between the two. And understanding how to =et 
over that is a separate class of problem, which is important and to whi=h we don't know the answer. 
And then there's a third class of problem which is local an= personal, which is that I'm in the business of teaching. And 
the question=is, how do you find the connection between individual students and what they want to do in such a 
fashion that they end up being=good scientists. What's necessary to do that? 
What problems are being neglected? 
I don't have strong feelings about that. There are so many =roblems in the world, from the origin of life or why proteins 
fold and how=life works or how the mind works, those are intellectual problems. And then there are problems like, how 
can you make lots of clean=water? And how can you store energy? And how do we get an energy balance f=r things and 
how do we deal with the development of an economic base for t=e developing world? And how do you think about 
global health? There are so many interesting problems that=there's no shortage of problems of every possible sort. 
Often the problems that are least worked on are the problem= that have the characteristic that they're important, but 
they don't seem =o be something which is the biggest or fastest or most profitable. And if it's really important but it's 
none of the above, then =ho does it? 
So water, for example. The number of people who really work=creatively on new sources of water isn't enormously large 
for the reason t=at I don't think people have very many ideas on how to get fundamentally new sources of water. We 
sort of think we've thought tha= problem through. I hope that's not true. But in every area where there's =omething 
that looks like a major change, it's usually because the field co=lectively had thought that it had thought about all the 
answers and had sort of given up, and then somebody =ame along with a new approach. And we certainly are going to 
need it for w=ter. 
Could there be an incentive structure, besides profitabi=ity, that would encourage researchers to address some of these 
problems? &=bsp; 
You could certainly imagine structures that might do that, =ut it's always tricky to predict outcomes because any 
incentive that you h=ve will be gamed in various ways. Universities are supposedly set up to incentivize, that is to
