Investors in Subsequent Closings Investors subscribing for Interests on a Subsequent Closing may 
participate in existing investments of the Underlying Fund diluting the Interests of the other Investors 
therein. Although such Investors will generally contribute their pro rata share of prior capital calls, there 
can be no assurance that this payment will reflect the fair value of the Underlying Fund's existing 
investments at the time such additional Interests am subscribed for. Furthermore, in the event that an 
investment of the Underlying Fund has been the subject of a disposition prior to the date of any Subsequent 
Closing, Investors at such Subsequent Closing may not be permitted to participate in such investment, as 
dctcnnined by the Investment Manager. 
Public Disclosure. Some of the Interests may be held by investors, such as public pension plans and listed 
investment vehicles, which am subject to public disclosure requirements. The amount of infommtion about 
their investments that is required to be disclosed has increased in recent years, and that trend may continue. 
To the extent that disclosure of confidential information relating to the Access Fund or the Underlying Fund 
results from interests being held by public investors, the Access Fund may be adversely affected. The 
General Partner may, in order to prevent any such potential disclosure, withhold information otherwise to 
be provided to such public investors. Conversely, potential future regulatory changes applicable to 
investment advisors and/or the accounts they advise could result in the Access Fund becoming subject to 
additional disclosure requirements, the specific nature of which is as yet uncertain. 
Borrowings. The General Partner may choose to commit all of the Limited Partners' Subscriptions to the 
Access Fund for investment into the Underlying Fund, in which case, the General Partner may need to fund 
Access Fund expenses or future capital calls by the Underlying Fund (to the extent all of the Limited 
Partners' Subscriptions have previously been called) through the distributions received from the Underlying 
Fund (in which case the Limited Partners will be allocated income without corresponding cash to pay taxes 
on such income) or through borrowings. 
The Access Fund may borrow money in an aggregate amount of up to 20% of the total Subscriptions to the 
Access Fund, including pursuant to a Credit Facility or other loans from a third party. Such borrowing 
provides the advantages of leverage. but exposes the Access Fund to capital risk and higher current 
expenses. The Access Fund may provide collateral to the banks from which it borrows by pledging some 
or all of the assets of the Access Fund (the "Access Fund Assets") and/or the Subscriptions to the Access 
Fund. In such event, the Access Fund may also be required to delegate the rights to issue drawdown notices 
and to receive capital contributions to a third party. This procedure exposes the Access Fund to the risk that 
for whatever reason, including, the default, insolvency. negligence, misconduct or fraud of such banks, the 
Access Fund will not reacquire the ownership of such Access Fund Assets upon the repayment by the 
Access Fund of such loans. Also, the Access Fund will be unable to reacquire such Access Fund Assets if 
the Access Fund defaults on such loans. The Access Fund's failure or inability to reacquire such Access 
Fund Assets from the banks in whose name the Access Fund Assets am pledged in support of a loan could 
involve the Access Fund in protracted litigation and, potentially, result in the complete loss of such Access 
Fund Assets. While the Investment Manager will cause the Access Fund to borrow money only from banks 
it believes to be creditworthy, there can be no absolute certainty that such banks will return such Access 
Fund Assets to the Access Fund upon the repayment of such loans. 
The Underlying Fund may also borrow funds including pursuant to a credit facility or other loans from a 
third party. Such borrowings may require the Glendower GP or an affiliate to pledge all or a portion of the 
property of the Underlying Fund and/or the commitments to the Underlying Fund (including the Access 
Fund's commitment to the Underlying Fund). The borrowing by the Underlying Fund may make it more 
difficult for the Access Fund to enter into a Credit Facility or otherwise borrow funds. If the Access Fund 
is not able to borrow sufficient funds to fund any obligations in advance of receipt of amounts from Limited
