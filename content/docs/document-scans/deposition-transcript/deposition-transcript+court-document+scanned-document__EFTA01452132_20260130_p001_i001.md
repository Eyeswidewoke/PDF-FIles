SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
required to be advanced by such Partner pursuant to a Drawdown Notice (and to the 
extent so applied shall be deemed to have been distributed and readvanced by such 
Partner), provided that any Additional Payment payable to such Partner shall be 
distributed to such Partner and (it) such amounts in respect of the General Partner's Share 
that would have been advanced by such Subsequent Closing Partner had it been admitted 
to the Fund at the Initial Closing (without giving effect to any reduction for Incentive 
Points if such Subsequent Closing Partner is admitted to the Fund after the Initial 
Closing), together with Additional Payments thereon, which amounts shall be paid by the 
Fund to the General Partner and (iii) such amount as determined in good faith by the 
General Partner that is appropriate to take into account the repayment of Indebtedness or 
payment of any other liability (other than any Indebtedness or other liability that has been 
repaid or paid by the advance of Loans by previously admitted Partners), less, in each 
case, such amount as the General Partner determines is appropriate to take into account 
any distributions of Distributable Cash theretofore made. Amounts contributed to the 
Fund by Subsequent Closing Partners and distributed to previously admitted Partners 
shall, in accordance with section 707(a) of the Code, be treated for all purposes of this 
Agreement and for all accounting and tax reporting purposes as payments made directly 
from the Subsequent Closing Partner to the previously admitted Partners in connection 
with a sale in part of the previously admitted Partners' Interests to the Subsequent 
Closing Partners, and each Subsequent Closing Partner shall succeed to the appropriate 
portion of the Loans of the previously admitted Partners. The General Partner shall 
appropriately adjust the Partners' Capital Contributions, Loans, Remaining 
Commitments, Sharing Percentages, Partner Accounts and any other relevant items to 
give effect to the intent of the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.2. If the General 
Partner determines in its reasonable discretion and in good faith that adverse tax 
consequences could result from the application of this Section 10.2, the General Partner 
may adjust the amounts advanced by the Subsequent Closing Partners and the amounts 
distributed to one or more previously admitted Limited Partners. Additional Payments 
shall not be treated as Loans. 
(c) 
Multi-Fund Adjustments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Agreement, the General Partner may (1) adjust the amount and timing of the payments 
under Section I0.2(b) to take into account the closing of any Related Investment Fund, 
and any investments held by the Fund or any Related Investment Fund at the time of a 
Closing and (it) reallocate among the Fund or the Related Investment Funds any 
investments held by the Fund or Related Investment Fund at the time of a Closing at cost 
(plus Additional Payments thereon), in each case to the extent determined in the good 
faith judgment of the General Partner to be appropriate to give effect to the intent of this 
Section 10.2. After the payments, distributions, reallocations and adjustments described 
in this Section 10.2 are taken into account, each portfolio investment, to the extent 
determined in the good faith and reasonable judgment of the General Partner to be 
practicable or appropriate, shall be held by the Fund or any Related Investment Fund in 
such proportions as if the Fund and each Related Investment Fund had a single closing on
