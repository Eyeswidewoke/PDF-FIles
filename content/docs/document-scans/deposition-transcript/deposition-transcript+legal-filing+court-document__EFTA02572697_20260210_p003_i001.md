from a relief that =urope is at least not blowing up this year, or whether we can see Europe o=fering good value and 
economic upside over the more medium term. 
* 
We are somewhere in the middle here, seein= the rebound a reflection of more rational policy making 
(more monetary po=icy support and a move from destructive austerity) and progress towards re=ucing EMU North 
South imbalances. Wage cost gaps between the core and periphery are shrinking an= the periphery's current account 
deficit has virtually disappeared. The =urrent quiet in euro financial markets, supported by the OMT and ESM, coul= thus 
last for years. We note that this does not mean that Europe will become an economic locomotive, as supp=y-side 
economics and macro stimulus are sorely missing. Overall, with a co=tinued absence of a funding crisis, relative value 
and client flows will d=ive performance, in our view. We stay overweight European equities relative to EM, and credit 
against the U=, as the great rotation has arrived in the US, but not in Europe.</=> 
" 
We have been overweight Japanese eq=ities versus EM since Nov of last year, to position for Japanese 
reflation= This has performed well, but has lost money over the past month, as econo=ic data have started to disappoint 
against our quite bullish expectations. We cut 2013 Japan gr=wth from 2.2% to 2.0% today, and in GMOS this week took 
half profit on our OW. This is largely position =anagement as we remain long-term bullish on Japanese reflation and 
equitie=. 
Fixed l=come 
• 
Bond yields followed equity markets down t=is week. Globally, we retain a bearish bias on bonds, but do 
not see this =s a structural short as the expected rise in yield is likely to remain une=en, and highly variable by country. 
• 
In the US, we retain a bearish bias on mom=ntum, the start of tapering next month, and evidence of 
investors switchin= broadly from fixed income to equities. We continue to execute this view b= selling the belly of the 
curve 5s against l0s and 2s. In euros, we stay short 10-year Bunds on =teadily improving economic data. In sterling, the 
move to rate guidance by=the BoE if anything increases uncertainty and we move from bullish to neut=al. And in Japan, 
we remain positive duration. In Australia, we stay bullish as the RBA has further room to eas=. We stay bearish in local 
EM bonds. 
Equitie= 
* 
The prospective rebound in global manuf=cturing is inducing us to open an overweight in Cyclical vs. 
Defensive=equity sectors globally. Both our US and European equity strategists are c=rrently favoring Cyclical sectors. 
• 
It is true that the global manufacturing P=I has not yet staged a convincing rebound. But our economists 
are confiden= of a manufacturing rebound in the coming months, driven initially by DM e=onomies but also pulling EM 
economies along on the way up. China's July activity indicators are a=ding conviction to this view. 
• 
Is this is a reason to reverse our EM equi=y underweight? We do not think so. We think that a better trade 
to position for a rebound in global manufac=uring is via a Cyclical vs. Defensive sector overweight rather than an EM =s. 
DM equity overweight. This is because the driver of this manufactur=ng rebound emanates from within DM rather than 
EM. 
* 
Are depressed valuations a good reason =o buy EM equities? We do not think so, either. It is true that the 
PE gap between=MSCI World and MSCI EM indices has been widening for two years now to well=above historical 
averages, 3.8 pts currently vs. a historical average of 2=7. This 3.8pt gap is above average but not exceptionally high as 
shown in the chart above. Gaps=of this magnitude could have been used as an argument to buy EM equities a= the 
beginning of the year or in 1995/1996, but that would have proved a d=sastrous bet. In addition, the valuation gap 
between EM and DM equities narrows if one adjusts for the hi=her weight of commodity sectors in EM which typically 
trade at a lower mul=iple than other sectors.
