PERSPECTIVE 
MEDICAL FACTS VS. VALUE JUDGMENTS 
oping guidelines laying out the 
standard of care — fail to recog-
nize when they have gone be-
yond the medical facts to make 
value judgments, they will harm 
patients by taking viable choices 
away from them.

Breaking the Silence of the Switch — Increasing Transparency 
about Trainee Participation in Surgery

e stand and swap operating-
room chairs, soundless in 
our socked feet. The room is si-
lent as I run through the steps 
at the microscope: corneal in-
cisions, viscoelastics, capsulo-
rhexis — the tearing with for-
ceps of a small circular hole in 
the anterior capsule to gain ac-
cess to the lens. I breathe shal-
lowly, trying to avoid making a 
sound with each inhale and ex-
hale; the casual chit-chat com-
mon in operating rooms is con-
spicuously absent. I am relieved 
to hear the ding and musical 
crescendos of the phacoemul-
sification machine as it uses 
fluid and ultrasound to remove 
the cataract fragments. Silence 
returns as I insert the new lens 
and complete the final steps of 
the procedure. Then Dr. X nudges 
me aside to remove the speculum 
that holds open the eyelids and 
she pulls off the sterile drape cow 
ering the patient's face, which 
also prevents him from seeing. 
"All done," says Dr. X. "Every-
thing went well." She smiles, 
placing a shield over the patient's 
left eye, and he is wheeled out. 
Dr. X turns to me. "Well done," 
she says. She gives me a few tips 
on how to "chop" the lens more 
efficiently and grabs the next 
chart. 
Not all attending eye surgeons 
expect trainees to operate in si-
lence, but many ophthalmology 
residents experience some varia-
tion on this scenario. Some sur-
geons speak openly as residents 
operate, and others even berate 
trainees for their technique, with 
little regard for patients' percep-
tions. l never minded such tongue 
lashings; rather, I always dreaded 
the silent switch. The miming, 
soundless communication over 
the top of a fully alert patient is 
clearly deceptive and seems direct-
ly at odds with the trust required 
in a good physician—patient rela-
tionship. 
The problem of undisclosed 
trainee participation in care is 
not unique to ophthalmology —
it is relevant to physicians train-
ing to perform procedures of all 
kinds. A qualitative study of 
Canadian surgeons in multiple 
specialties revealed a lack of dis-
closure to patients of the details 
of intraoperative participation by 
residents,' and surgery residents 
express moral angst over patients' 
lack of awareness of their role. 
It's relatively easy to keep the 
concept of resident participation 
abstract if a patient will be asleep 
or sedated during a procedure or 
if it must be performed by a team 
rather than an individual sur-
geon. The resident's role is more 
evident, however, in single-oper-
ator procedures such as cataract 
surgery, as an alert patient lies 
on the table waiting for someone 
to cut open his or her eye. The 
minimal sedation used forces the 
surgeon to either fully disclose 
the trainee's involvement or overt-
ly deceive the patient to some de-
