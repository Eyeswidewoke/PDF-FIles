gets even worse later--"lies have short legs"--but this d=esn't make me a bad person because it's never done in a mean 
way. =alues are extremely important to me and loyalty is the one I would never g=ve up for anything. The fact that I lied 
doesn't take away my values a=d the fact that I will always be loyal to you. You told me once you will a=ways be there 
for me just like I will always be there for you... Yes, alwa=s. Also when you will get older I will be there for you and that is 
a prom=se that I will keep no matter what happens... because I care. I really do.=/div> 
I know that I've let you down so many ti=es, but never so much as I let myself down. However, experiencing 
failure =s the only way for me to learn and understand how to do things right. My m=ods are very unstable and when I'm 
down I feel paralyzed, closing myse=f in loneliness... I wish I could change. Maybe speaking with I psychologi=t would be 
helpful. 
=/div> 
The reason I want to go =o school is that my mother never got a diploma and this is one of her bigg=st regrets. 
She couldn't find a job later on also because of this... U=like you, she had no particular talent to make it without one and 
until no= I haven't discovered any in myself either. For this reason getting a =egree would give me additional security. 
You=told me I need to find a part time job by mid-February and I think it'= a good idea. I already started asking 
around for anything available and a=ked for help on my cv. As you know nobody of my family ever worked so I do='t 
have any good examples to follow when it comes to all of this...Unt=l I get a real position somewhere, I really would like 
to continue my stud=es. The other reason is that unlike the US, here in Europe everything is m=re difficult, people are 
closed minded and the mentality is different whi=h makes it even harder to make it without one. 
I'm starting to get to know myself a little more now and I kno= that for me it takes longer to assimilate and make 
things work but at the=end I do make it... It is a question of time and getting all the parts tog=ther. 
Jeffrey, I am extremely grateful=for your help. I've realized that I've put my life in your hands..= and I know or at 
least I hope that one day you will be proud of me.

letterpress"> 
Ps: I'm trying to get my grades to send them t= you but I don't know why they don't show up. I know they are 
very=bad and that this will be an additional big deception... Now I know and wi=l do everything I can to make it right 
next time. I won't let you down=
