Here are the true key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a =uccessful self-made businessman with no prior 
criminal history whatsoever,=engaged in illegal conduct that amounted to solicitation of prostitut=on. That conduct was 
wrong and a violation of Florida stat= law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs or the like wer= involved, 
some of the women he paid were under the age of 18. =hose facts were carefully assessed by experienced state sex 
crime pro=ecutors who aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned = blind eye to potential offenses to the 
public order. To the contrar=, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive fiftee=-month 
investigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. M=. Epstein was then indicted by the state grand jury on a 
single felony cou=t of solicitation of prostitution. 
During that intense inv=stigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed th= 
evidence, met face-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered =heir credibility — or lack thereof — and 
considered the ex=ent of exculpatory evidence, including sworn testimony from=many that they lied about being 
eighteen years old to be allowed into Mr. =pstein's home. After months of negotiations, the state prose=utors believed 
they had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that v=ndicated the public interest — a resolution entirely 
consistent wi=h that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants. The s=stem worked as it should have. 
=u> 
Then, in came the feds. The United States Attorney=ft39;s Office extensively and aggressively 
investigated whether Mr. Epstein=had engaged in a commercial human trafficking ring, targeted minors, =r used the 
internet or traveled interstate in the process. But that=E24*s not what this was and that's not what happened= That 
is precisely why the federal authorities' ultimat= decision to defer prosecution to the state was the right one.=C2* 
However, the=federally-demanded resolution was not without conditions. The federal 
pros=cutors insisted on various unorthodox requirements that Mr. Epstein=E2.4es experienced defense team had 
never seen imposed on any defendant=anywhere. Under the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was required to re=uest that 
the state prosecutors demand the imposition of a thirty-month se=tence that included both jail time and the strictest 
condit=ons of probation: lifetime sex-offender registration. Those draconian meas=res were far more than warranted by 
the state grand jury's in=ictment and would not have otherwise been required under the previous=y agreed-upon state 
disposition. As part of this highly unusual deal,=the government required Jeffrey to pay for a highly experienced =roup of 
attorneys to bring claims against him on behalf of a governme=t list of asserted victims. Jeffrey was required to waive 
the right to cha=lenge those claims without being provided the asserted victim's id=ntities by the government until after 
he was incarcerated. Important=y, the feds' decision to decline prosecution in deference to the state=C2Qin exchange 
for these extraordinary requirements was review=d and approved at the multiple levels of the U.S. Department of 
Justice.=C2* Jeffrey took full responsibility, complied with the feds=E24040 demands, served his sentence, and in the 
process was treated exac=ly the same (including his time served) as any other state-incar=erated individuals. His 
conduct while in custody was exemplary, and =o characterized by the state custodial authorities. 
Jeffre= Epstein has paid his debt to society. The challenges to his Agreemen= with the 
Government must also be understood as challenges to the mil=ions Mr. Epstein paid to the asserted victims and their 
lawyers pursuant t= that agreement. Amongst the beneficiaries of the Epstein-Federal Gov=rnment Agreement were the 
many victims who collectively received many mill=ons as a result of the conditions imposed on Mr. Epstein that 
prevented hi= from meaningfully contesting civil liability — moneys that would =e at issue if requests to invalidate the 
agreement were granted.=/u>
