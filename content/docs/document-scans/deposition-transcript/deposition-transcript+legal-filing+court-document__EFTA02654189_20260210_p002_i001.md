=div dir="ltr"> 
Noam —<=u> 
Thank you for your reply.=C2 As you indicate that you are not being represented by counsel I will=reply directly to you, 
with a copy to Rich (as you suggest). Please consider: 
1. 
As a starting point,=let me note that I think you and Rich may have misunderstood (at least ini=ially) the terms of 
the settlement that Harry proposed through his attorney. Rich and I discussed this in a call about 10 d=ys ago and I'm 
hoping that misunderstanding has been cleared up, b=t as I'm not a party to your exchanges (and Rich's exchang=s) with 
Harry's attorney I can't be sure. I'= also not certain whether the terms of the proposed settlement have changed. All I 
can=say for sure is that characterizing the offer as one in which distribution= to you cannot exceed $100K per year is not 
consistent with my understandi=g of what has been offered. 
The reason why the proposal is too outrageous t= discuss has nothing to do with the technicalities of the handout that 
Har=y is graciously offering. I'll review the background, once again= 
As I've discusse= before, the Marital Trust was established in Carol's name for tax pur=oses. The obvious intention, 
clearly understood by Carol and me, and=of course Eric Menouya, was that it would be available to the survivor -- =arol 
we assumed -- and then what remains would go to the beneficiaries. =AO The idea that we intended that Carol would 
control "her" fund= and I would control "mine" is too ludicrous to discuss, though = understand the legalistic conjuring 
that can be adduced to reach this con=fusion. 
When I =ppointed Harry to replace me as trustee, I took for granted that he would =andle the trust as I had. His 
behavior since, and this latest propos=l, make it very clear how wrong that assumption was. This proposal c=Ils for him 
to be in complete charge, which means, as he has shown, that I=can only plead for some funds by accepting conditions 
that he knows I will=not accept. You recall, I presume, that this was true even when I fa=ed an enormous tax bill 
because my IRA was being depleted for the benefit =f the family. 
To refr=sh your memory, let me repeat again what was happening with my IRA until l=learned about it. There is a 
mandatory withdrawal. Half was be=ng distributed to family. The other half was being used for taxes an= management 
fees for the entire estate. In order to pay Alex's m=dical expenses, and to pay $50,000 a year for rent and upkeep on the 
house=in Wellfleet that we had given to the children and that I was barely using= I had to withdraw extra funds from the 
IRA, with the onerous tax burden.=C2 The same when I withdrew something to live on. Under these cir=umstances, 
Harry refused to release funds from the Trust for tax relief wi=hout onerous and humiliating conditions that he knew I 
would not accept.=C2 Easy to predict what might happen under less extreme conditions. =AO 
For such reasons, =arry's proposal is, as I said, too outrageous to discuss.</=> 
2. 
As you know, Harry's attorney has comm=nced a legal action that is intended to facilitate my resignation and the 
=ppointment of a successor trustee to take my place. Since you've wanted me removed for some ti=e and since I've said 
(from the first time you and I met) that I o=ly wanted to serve as trustee if all the family members wanted me to serve= 
I'm looking forward to resigning as soon as the court determines how I am to do so and how my successor is to be 
selected. =C2 
3. 
Given that my replac=ment is impending, it might be worth waiting until my successor is in plac= before 
responding to my requests for financial disclosure, as it's possible that my successor won't share my views as=to what
