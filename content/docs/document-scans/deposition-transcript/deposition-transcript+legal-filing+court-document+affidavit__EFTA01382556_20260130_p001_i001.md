Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Tabk of Contents 
Registrant regarding which indemnification is sought. Reference is also made to the underwriting agreement to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 to 
this registration statement, which provides for the indemnification of executive officers, directors and controlling persons of the Registrant 
against certain liabilities. The indemnification provisions in the Registrant's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the indemnification 
agreements entered into or to be entered into between the Registrant and each of its directors and executive officers may be sufficiently 
broad to permit indemnification of the Registrant's directors and executive officers for liabilities arising under the Securities Act. The 
Registrant currently carries liability insurance for its directors and officers.
