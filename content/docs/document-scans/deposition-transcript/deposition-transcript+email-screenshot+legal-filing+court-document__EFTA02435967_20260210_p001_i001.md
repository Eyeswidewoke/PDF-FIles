Title: RE: Lisa Randall 
I talked to Lisa at length. I summarized my thoughts to her: sounds like CalTech is her true love and NYU is the 
rich boyfriend. She agreed, but i think she is looking for someone to sponsor the true love so that her decision 
will be easier - and no doubt the results would be better, too. 
I am not in the *support science and arts" business now for a while, but gentlemen, this may be certainly a good 
cause for you. I agree with Nathan on the money comments (as with everything else ;-) but I think the issue of 
support is more the team that can be built, not necessarily the personal income, so the books/consulting/etc. 
approach will not work that well.

Feel free to pass this along to Lisa, and I would be happy to discuss with her in person in addition. 
There arc several issues raised in your email. 
First there is I larvard vs Caltech or NYU. I think that the key issue there is where she will be comfortable. I agree with 
your assessment about reputation value of Ilarvard/CaltchtNYU, but if she has a second book out and you as her agent I 
don't think that she has to worry about that quite so much. Her brand value is mostly personal at this point - she isn't just 
some random professor at I lanurd. she is Lisa Randall. 
Within physics community nobody cares about what place she is - her papers arc what matters. 
An academic department doesn't actually do much for a theoretical physicist. You get an office and some teaching and 
committee duties, but that is about it. She could do her work anywhere, especially now that she has an established 
reputation. 
If they arc annoying her, then it should be taken seriously because it is not going to change anytime soon. Department 
chairmen can hold the post forever, and the rest of the faculty will be there even longer. So if she is not getting along with 
the department now there is no reason to think it will change. 
If she wants to build an empire, then NYU's deal which includes hiring other faculty would be a possibility. I don't know 
whether Lisa wants to do that or not, but my guess is not. So I don't see any reason to go for NYLI, unless she wants a 
mini-empire, or unless she really and truly wants to live in NYC. 
One option that is not mentioned is whether there are other institutions that ought to be considered. Lisa is very high 
profile. and I suspect that there arc departments that would love to have her. If they know she is "in play" then they might
