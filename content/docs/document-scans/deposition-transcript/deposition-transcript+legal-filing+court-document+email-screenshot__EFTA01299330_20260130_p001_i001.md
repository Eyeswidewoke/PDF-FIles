Classification: Confidential 
Hi Velmir, 
There was one (1) AML Compliance Investigation where an individual known as "Darren Indyke" was the subject. I have 
attached the relevant portions of the investigation below. Please be advised we have no additional information for the 
individual "Darren Indyke" other than what is listed below. Consequently, we have no way to determine if the "Darren 
Indyke" that is the subject of your inquiry, is the same party as the "Darren Indyke" that was a subject in the below-
referenced investigation. 
Relevant portions of the AML-Compliance Investigation from 09/07/2016 follow: 
Darren K. Indyke ("Indyke") is an attorney practiciii,
ithe State of New York. Indyke maintains a WM business 
checking account as follows: Account Number: 
, Open Date: 11/1/2013, registered as Darren K. Indyke PLLC, 
575 Lexington Ave, 4th Flr. New York, NY 10022. Indyke is the sole member and owner of the law firm. Indyke's 
personal residence is on record as "Kean Court, Livingston, New Jersey 07039." 
WM account records indicate that Jeffrey Esptein ("Epstein'), of 6100 Red Hook Quarter B3, St. Thomas, US VI 00802, 
has appoin Se). 
e to act as agent for him. Epstein also maintains a WM checking account as follows: Account 
Number: 
Open Date: 03/08/2016, registered as Jeffrey Epstein, 6100 Red Hook Qtr, B3, Saint Thomas. 
United States Virgin Islands 00802-1348. 
On a monthly basis, Indyke has routinely cashed a $7,500 check drawn on Epstein's WM account at the WM Bank branch 
located at 345 Park Avenue, New York, NY. Occasionally, Indyke withdraws funds from his own accounts at the same 
time. DBTCA has previously filed CTRs on the cash withdrawal activities of Indyke exceeding $10,000 on 05/28/2014 and 
02/16/2016. 
Activity: 
According to the WM Bank Teller from 345 Park Avenue, on 07/20/2016, Indyke brought two (2) checks to the teller 
window: 
1) Check number 1054 drawn on Epstein's WM checking account in the amount of 57,500, and 
2) Check number 1045 drawn on Indyke's WM attorney business account in the amount of $4,000. 
Indyke presented the $7,500 check for cashing, and mentioned that he would be cashing the $4,000 check the next 
business day to, "avoid all the paperwork and going over his cash limit." On 07/21/2016, Indyke returned to the 345 Park 
Avenue Branch to cash check number 1045 in the amount of $4,000 drawn on his business account. 
Based on Indyke's statement and behavior, it appears that he purposely structured cash transactions in order to avoid the 
CTR requirement. 
Based on the activity described above, WM AML conducted a one-year historical review of the activity in Indyke's multi-
account WM relationship, and did not identify any other instances of possible CTR avoidance. 
Further research indicated that Epstein, Indyke's client and source of funds for the $7,500 check, spent thirteen (13) 
months in a Florida State Prison after pleading guilty in 2008 to procuring an underage girl for prostitution. Indyke appears 
to represent Epstein in other legal matters, including his charitable endeavors. Epstein reportedly lives on a private island 
in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands, and has homes in Manhattan and elsewhere. Epstein is a registered level three sex 
offender under Florida State law. 
Kind regards,
