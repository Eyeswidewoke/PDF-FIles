globally. The 1991 Explanatory Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation 
trial and describes the Brotherhood's work in America as a "Civilization-Jihadist Process with all 
the word means" and "a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization 
from within and 'sabotaging' its miserable house by their own hands and the hands of the 
believers so that it is eliminated and God's religion is made victorious over all other religions." 
Much as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term 
plan to destroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying 
the nuclear family, secularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many 
strategies to infiltrate while eroding the foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into 
an Islamic one. The Control Factor has many ingenious ways to convince us that this is ridiculous, 
that our courts and system would never allow such a thing, that one is racist or "Islamophobic," if 
not insane, for even thinking this is real. And just as with the communists, time is plentiful. Even 
more so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-decade plan is short term. It is not critical that a seriou 
sly engaged Muslim lives to see the result. It is critical, more correctly a duty, however, that he 
carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for Security Policy's Team B Report, Shariah: 
The Threat to America are excellent sources for your readers to pursue these documents. 
FP: And so what you call an "Inner Jihad" has to start. It's our, as you say, mandatory "addiction 
treatment" Please explain. 
Siegel: The "Inner Jihad" is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control 
Factors. There is a famous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, 
essentially says that the physical fight was the "lesser Jihad" and it is time to then attend to the 
"greater Jihad !I- that internal battle against our own internal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and 
so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to say that "Jihad" is not violent, it is useful to 
us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally against our own Control Factor 
tendencies. 
As I said earlier, the Control Factor is "active" and "continuous" so we must constantly monitor 
and combat it. Like "Whack-a-Mole," just as we may think we have addressed it, another 
variation pops right up. I use the terms "addict" and "enabler" because we truly need a form of 
rehab to break the habitual power of the Control Factor and because our relationship with our 
Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a typical addict and his enabler. And just as it is so 
difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler act essentially addicted to his behavior 
and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship involves the transfer of 
responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant actions onto us with our response 
framed essentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy's grievance. (Your 
book, United in Hate, describes this addiction to hate in detail. 
The key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and 
resultant actions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all 
we can about the enemy. We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and 
rediscover who we are and are not. We must speak up. We must support those Muslims who 
promote expressions of Islam that are consistent with our principles. And we must stalk the C 
ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its intrusion. This is an individual endeavor as each of 
our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book gives plenty of examples of each maneuver
