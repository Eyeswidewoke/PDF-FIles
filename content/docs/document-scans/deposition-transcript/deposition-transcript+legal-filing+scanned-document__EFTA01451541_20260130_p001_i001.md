verification of identity from all persons or entities submitting a Subscription Agreement 
and any beneficial owner underlying the account. Furthermore, in response to increased 
regulatory concerns with respect to the sources of funds used in investments and other 
activities, the Master Fund General Partner may request the Onshore Feeder Fund in its 
capacity as limited partner to provide additional documentation verifying, among other 
things, its source of funds used to purchase the investments. Each Investor will be required 
to make such representations to the Feeder Funds as the General Partner, the Investment 
Manager, and the Feeder Funds shall require in connection with applicable anti-money 
laundering programs, including, without limitation, representations to the Feeder Funds 
that such investor is not, and is not acting on behalf of, a prohibited country, territory, 
individual or entity listed on the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control ("OFAC') website or on HM Treasury's Sanction List ("HMTSL"), and that it is 
not directly or indirectly affiliated with any country, territory, individual or entity named 
on an OFAC list or prohibited by any OFAC sanctions programs. Such Investor will also 
represent to the Feeder Funds that amounts contributed by it to the Feeder Funds were not 
directly or indirectly derived from activities that may contravene U.S. Federal, state or 
international laws and regulations, including, without limitation, any applicable 
anti-money laundering laws and regulations. 
The General Partner, the Investment Manager and the Feeder Funds (or their delegates) 
reserve the right to request such information as they deem necessary to verify such 
information. In the event of delay or failure by the subscriber to produce any information 
required for verification purposes, the General Partner or the Investment Manager may 
refuse to accept a subscription, may "freeze" such Limited Partner's account and/or 
Interest or may compulsorily redeem such Limited Partner's Interest in the applicable 
Feeder Fund. 
Additionally, the Master Fund General Partner may decline to accept a subscription on the 
basis of such information that is provided or if such information is not provided. Requests 
for documentation and additional information may be made at any time during which the 
Onshore Feeder Fund holds an investment in the Master Fund. The Master Fund General 
Partner may be required to provide this information, or report the failure to comply with 
such requests, to appropriate governmental authorities, including for the purpose of 
complying with any anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist laws or regulations, in certain 
circumstances without notifying the Onshore Feeder Fund that the information has been 
provided. Further, under the Master Fund Partnership Agreement, the Master Fund 
General Partner may, without the consent of limited partners of the Master Fund (including 
the Onshore Feeder Fund), take any action it determines in its sole discretion to be 
necessary or advisable to comply with any anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist laws, 
rules or regulations. Governmental authorities are continuing to consider appropriate 
measures to implement and at this point it is unclear what steps the Master Fund General 
Partner may be required to take; however, these steps may include prohibiting the Onshore 
Feeder Fund from making further contributions of capital to the Master Fund, depositing
