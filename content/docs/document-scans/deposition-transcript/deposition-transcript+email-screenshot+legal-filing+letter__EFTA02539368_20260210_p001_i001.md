Re: 
Can you imagine all the great things I could have do=e in 3 years if you had helped me properly in the right way with 
consisten=y instead of just wanting to prove a point and criticize me the whole time=?? I could have lived and worked in 
NY, Parson school, best internships, b=st photographers, acting school... but for some reason you always rejected=me, 
you never allowed me to come to NY, never allowed me to follow my pass=ons and all the internships and jobs that I did 
I've always had to fin= them on my own with none of your help and still it was never ok for you. =nstead of pushing me 
and do everything in your power to realize my dreams,=you stopped me, pulled me back saying " this is the price you 
have to=pay" or " you haven't finished your sentence" making me=lose the 3 best years of my life from 20 to 23.

go to class .? in italy, you =anted only to go to parties, driving school more parties. =AO I did my bes to try to get you 
to stop . but you continued =lways with an attitude. you traveled to china. to =eanr and all you had to do was tell the 
truth and not steal. =C2 and then you still refuse to accept your own role and continuerto blame me and the rest of the 
world. 
Sad to hear that the only thing you care about is your money. What s=rious damage did I do to you ? You use the 
term stealing when the only thi=g I did was taking a film class I was interested in after the semester was=already paid. I 
didn't take any extra money for it. You make it sound =ike if I robbed you or I don't know what, telling me horrendous 
things=for years, even after I apologized. 
What you did to me was much, much worse because you inte=rupt my studies, left me in the street and all this 
in the middle of my gr=wth without carrying about my future and all the psychological consequence= that followed, 
including my attachment to you. 
I cared about you more than everything and loved y=u more than anything I have ever seen or imagined and you 
hurt me greatly =treating me like a pair of shoes.
