the brain. Neural programs. Not heart. 
Every movie is the first movie. Every lover is the first love in terms of the simultaneous operations of the brain. The brain 
most likely has an operant circuit for the experience of orgasm. Whenever an appropriate partner happens along, the button is 
pressed . . . bzzz . . . the circuit is activated. The acquisition of experience by the brain inhibits acquisition of new experience. 
It is an ordering and rigidifying process. The bzzz activating the orgasm circuit gives form to what is already happening in the 
brain. The brain can set off this circuit with or without the active participation of the partner. Some of manaTMs finest 
moments occurred when he was fast asleep. Bzzz. The neural impulse is not necessarily determined by the nature of the 
sensory input. Any variety of stimuli will do it. The explicit operations of the brain will one day be readily available at the 
press of a button. 
Electrical stimulation of the brain has triggered experiences that cannot be distinguished as being different from real." In 
other words, the brain is not capable of distinguishing between the real and the illusory. aceBy appropriate electrical 
stimulation of cell aggregates of living human brains, phenomena can be evoked which have reminiscent aspects (in some 
instances memorylike in the old sense of the term), characteristics which at times rival ordinary afferent sensory stimulation in 
their vivid insistence and intrusion upon the stream of consciousness, and at still other times rival effective responses 
appropriate to the content of the phenomenon elicited.a" For the brain, there is no illusion. Reality is whatever the brain is 
doing. Electrical stimulation can activate programs of prior experience. In the process of decoding and deciphering the 
functions of neural activity, it seems a realizable possibility to be able to enjoy such pleasures as the orgasm a hundred, a 
thousand times a day. 
For the brain, there is no illusion. There is no line marking arbitrary divisions such as good and bad, normal and perverse, 
sanity and insanity. Reality is whatever the brain is doing. On the neural level there is no insanity, there is no negative mode of 
thought, there is no perversion, there are no impossibilities, no responsibilities. 
Given that the genetic structure of the organism stabilized ages ago, manands evolutionary growth and development became a 
function of his own activities. Information passed through generations of brains. The effect of this information is environment. 
Environment is past experience; environment is illusion. The environment included man. Man never knew what was 
happening. His knowledge, his awareness, was illusion. To ask questions, to decode, to decipher the transactions, look to the 
environment, the effect, and work backward. The efferent motor activity, the output, or environment, related by feedback of 
information to the afferent neural impulse, the input. Forget about man. The brain is only a terminal, not an originator. Look 
to the environment and measure how the brain changes through the transaction with the forces that are nonlinear extensions 
of its own experience. 
The brain is not a repository for ideas. No brain ever had an idea in it. Realize, then, that man molded himself, and that nature 
was therefore manmade, reality being in the operations of the brain. All things considered to be innate and natural were in 
effect functions of the ordering of the simultaneous operations of the brain. The key to nature lies in the study of manaTMs 
communication." Man, the most social of animals. The Golden Rule said, aceDo unto others.a But there is no aceother.a 
There is no self. The division is gone. There is unlimited involvement. 
In the name of God. And God created man in His own image. And man created God in his own image. But now the only 
image to be considered is operant, one which cannot statically exist in a fixed place. It is to be located in the operations of the 
brain, not in a place, not in a time. Space and time, which cannot be directly experienced. in the universe of simultaneous 
operations there is only information. Man was not aware of direct experience. These dimensions are beyond space and time. 
They are the dimensions of direct experience, dimensions not accessible to the individual mind, not accessible to man.
