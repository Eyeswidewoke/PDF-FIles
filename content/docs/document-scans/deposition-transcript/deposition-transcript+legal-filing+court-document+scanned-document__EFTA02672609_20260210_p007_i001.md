Label people -- literally. 
Franklin Roosevelt was known to have a memory that would put most of us to shame -- he could remember the 
name of someone he met just on=e, months ago, seemingly without difficulty. His secret? Roosevelt was a=le to 
remember the names of everyone on his staff (and everyone he met) by visualizing their names writ=en across their 
foreheads after being introduced to them. This technique is=even more effective when the name is imagined being 
written in your favorite color marker,CNN claims.

Perhaps the best (and arguably most difficult) memory hack of all is simply paying attention to the task, 
conversation or experience a= hand. Distraction makes our memories weaker, and consequently we are more prone to 
forget things. =93Forgetting... is a sign of how busy we are," Zaldy S. Tan, director of the Memory Disorders Clinic at 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, told Reader's Digest. "When we're not paying good attention, the memories we 
form aren't=A0very robust, and we have a problem retrieving the information later." 
Have trouble quieting your racing thoughts? Become more mindful by pra=ticing just 10 minutes a day of 
meditation. A recent University of California study found meditation to improve memory capacity =nd reduce mind-
wandering among students studying for the GRE. And in 2012, =IT researchers identified a neural circuit that helps to 
create long-lasting memories -- the circuit was found to work most effectively when, you guessed it, the brain =s paying 
attention to what it's looking at. 
On the week that Congressional Republicans forced a govern=ent shutdown in an attempt to repeal and/or 
delay Obamacare which is the first =ajor health legislation passed (not including the 2003 Medicare Prescription Dru=, 
Improvement, and Modernization Act) since Medicare and Medicaid were enacte= in 1965, almost unnoticed is the 
serious dysfunctionality of mental health in America. We often hear politicians in both major political parties erroneous 
claims — that America has the best healthcare in the world. And yes, this maybe true if you are rich, but in a country 
that has 50 million citizens who don't have health insurance and access to healthcare unless they show up at the 
hospital emergency room, in spite of its deficiencies at least Obamacare is a positive step in the right direction t= 
address this terrible injustice. But what is truly indefensible is the retched state of mental healthcare in the=US, which
