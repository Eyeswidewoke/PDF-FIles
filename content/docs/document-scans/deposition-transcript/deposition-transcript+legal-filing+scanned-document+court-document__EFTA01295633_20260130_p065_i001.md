785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
F.3d 940, 942 (7th Cir. 1997); Penk v. Or. St. Bd. of Higher Educ., 816 F.2d 458, 465 (9th 
Cir. 1987). A trier of fact must determine whether racial discrimination -- rather than 
chance or some other "confounding factor[]" -- caused an alleged disparity. In re Navy 
Chaplaincy, 738 F.3d 425, 429, 407 U.S. App. D.C. 436 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Only a controlled 
model can provide that answer, and Plaintiffs' experts' evidentiary model did not meet that 
definition. 
b. 
In most every employment case, a valid statistical ["•116] model must account for one 
particularly important explanatory variable: the applicant pool's qualifications. "[T]he 
relevant comparison is between the percentage of minority employees and the percentage 
of potential minority applicants in the qualified labor pool." Carter v. Ball, 33 F.3d 450, 456 
(4th Cir. 1994); see also City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 501-02, 109 
S. Ct. 706, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1989); McNaim v. Sullivan, 929 F.2d 974, 979 (4th Cir. 
1991). If courts were to accept statistical models containing unqualified applicants, then 
employers could be punished merely because of a "dearth of qualified nonwhite applicants 
(for reasons that are not [the employers] fault)." Wards Cove Packaging Co. v. Atonio, 490 
U.S. 642, 651, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 104 L. Ed. 2d 733 (1989). Thus, "statistics based on an 
applicant pool containing individuals lacking minimal qualifications for the job [are] of little 
probative value." Watson, 487 U.S. at 997; see also Paetzold & Willbom, supra, § 4:3 
("[W]hen considering potential discrimination in promotions within an organization, only 
employees qualified for promotion should be considered in the proxy pool."). Furthermore, 
"[n]o rational enterprise that has several qualified candidates for a position selects among 
them by lot; it picks the best qualified." Mason v. Cont'I III. Nat'l Bank, 704 F.2d 361, 364 
(7th Cir. 1983). So, a truly effective statistical model will not just account for minimum 
qualifications, but should control for the variations in skills even among minimally qualified 
applicants. 
[.942] By this point, Plaintiffs and their experts should rtm have known better than to 
ignore other explanatory factors. In a related case challenging promotions practices at a 
different Nucor facility, the Eighth Circuit found that similarly substandard work from the 
same expert did not create a triable question of fact on summary judgment. See Bennett, 
656 F.3d at 812. In so holding, the Eighth Circuit emphasized that the expert's statistics 
had "little force" because they "assumed that all applicants were qualified for promotion to 
each available position." Id. at 818. The Eighth Circuit is not alone. Other courts have 
criticized Plaintiffs' principal expert for employing his "warm body hypothesis," which 
"assumes that every person is just as qualified and skilled and experienced as everyone 
else." Davis v. Ala. Dep't of Educ. Dep't of Disability Determination Serv., 768 F. Supp. 
1471, 1477 (N.D. Ala. 1991); accord Adams v. Austal, U.S.A., L.L.C., No. 08-00155--KD-
