During the event, a sexual harassment complaint was filed =ith the 
administration against you. 
In 2012, as part of a =ormal review of its internal policies, the institute 
made a decision =hat you would not be invited to return. 
As =ou can see, the original claim by Buzzfeed, which they claimed was =erified 
'on the record' by Perimeter, was false. =nbsp;l believe this final claim is false, and I would like confirmation =rom you.. 
It may be a fine point, but I believe it is important. =nbsp;Originally Michael informed me immediately after the event 
that =here was a complaint of inappropriate communication with one of the =taff, something I indicated then and 
reiterate now, I am not aware of =t all, but be that as it may, he informed me at the time by email that =ith no further 
communication with that person, the matter was closed. =nbsp; Several years later I was invited to give another public 
lecture =ut your outreach coordinator later rescinded the invitation, although I =as reimbursed for that. As you are 
aware, I subsequently =iscussed this with Neil in Vancouver in that year, and inquired about =xactly what it was all 
about, and informed him that either a formal =rocedure to resolve any issue in which I could participate and respond 
=ight be appropriate, or the matter should be dropped. Neil said he =ould explore the matter, and neither he, nor 
anyone else, ever =ontacted me following that. I have never been informed of =nything like Buzzfeed has claimed. 
Indeed I have been invited back to =erimeter for scientific meetings by various colleagues in the =ntervening years. 
I am very concerned by this claim =elow, for obvious reasons. First, the original 
Perimeter source =rovided false and defamatory information to Buzzfeed, changing a story =nly after I provided counter-
evidence. Second, as you are aware =erimeter has never contacted me about any such proviso in the interim. =nbsp;The 
only document I ever received was in 2009 from michael =ssuring me the matter was closed, whatever it was. I would 
find =t highly irregular if any formal procedure took place with such an =utcome without my knowledge or without any 
due process, and without =ubsequently informing me. 
I expect the correct statement, if =here is one, is that there was a complaint 
from someone at Perimeter =bout inappropriate communication at the final party or while being =riven back to the 
hotel after it (for all I know it may have been about =eligious issues), and that 3 years later a decision was made by the 
=utreach coordinator, perhaps in collaboration with others, not to =nvite me back at that time for a public lecture. 
Please confirm my =nderstanding of this issue for me if you will. As you can 
=magine, making this public is embarrassing enough for me, especially =ince I personally maintain whatever I may have 
said wasn't =nappropriate, and there was certainly no sexual harassment by any =efinition of that word.. indeed there 
was nothing sexual in any =iscussion I know of. Nevertheless, if something is to be =eported, indicating that it was a 
communication issue, and there was no =ormal ban on my returning to Perimeter (especially as nothing along =hese 
lines was ever communicated to me and I have received invites =ince that time) is less damning than suggesting 
otherwise. As =uzzfeed has tried, at every turn, to misrepresent facts in the worst =ossible light, it is important for me 
to not allow them to continue to =o this. For example, they contacted my university and asked if =here any claims fo 
sexual harassment against me at the University, and =hough the University said there were not, but that there was an 
=xternal allegation about a remote event that had been discredited (the =ne I mentioned above), Buzzfeed announced 
they would report that they =ontacted the University with a request for information about sexual =arassment 
allegations and were not given any information in =eturn..
