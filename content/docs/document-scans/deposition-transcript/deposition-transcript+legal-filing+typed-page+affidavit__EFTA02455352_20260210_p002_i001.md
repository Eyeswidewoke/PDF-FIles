understanding would like to diversify its economy =nd be Money rich , to give it flexibility and security. takin= the co 
public is an idea of 25 years ago. it is silly, 4>=A0 shareholders are the last thing the kingdom needs. they a=e 
eventual weapons in any attack. world wide regulations banki=g securities etc have tilted the balance of power in their 
favor , at leas= for the time being , having a public co. comes wi=h many unnecessary constraints, future lawsuits.
U.S. =13.1 only the beginning. ). etc. 
Having money, =inancial power is not equal to having a public vehicle with reams of=disclosures. legal 
minefields . all good for lawyers and banke=s but certainly not the best path for a SOVEREIGN. 
=/div> 
a) money needs . 
domes=ic and int'l / shou=d the kingdom consider its own internal currency in 
addition to worl= currency. like the IMF , special depository receipts.=C240 these SDRs were created for a specif=c 
purpose. the equivalent can be created for SA internal use. = note any solution that does not take into account the 
vast i=creases in computer power and Internet ie=C20 the public offering of Aramco should be immediately 
suspicious.l>=A0 The military would never use weapons of the 60s in today's battles=C2. , so it should not use 
antiquated solutions to the financial problem= of today. 
b. the kingdom can i=sue debt backed by oil, currency exchangeable into oil.=? it would be the strongest 
currency quickly as most countries toda= are merely fiat. 
c. inve=tment in infra structure MUST take into account that are now living =n a ZERO interest rate 
environment. Saudi , china and Ru=sia , could begin to use other complementary currencies that would stay ou=side of 
the US banking system, a system that is often used as = hammer. 
2 . Acting as a large sov=reign wealth fund, is antiquated. there is not shortage of hug= amounts of capital 
and merely competing with hundreds of the most sophist=cated investors is a losing game. HOWEVER the coun=ry is a 
SOVEREIGN. this is the biggest asset. not =ts wealth alone. Sovereign nations are the only entities that can is=ues 
world wide accepted currencies . most nations that have co=sidered this are asset poor , so the currency is virtually 
worthless.Q=A0 SA presents a unique opportunity. =C24, What will the money be used for? 
why h=ve the same 
money for military equipment from another country as the money=the local Jeddah resident uses to buy milk/ 
=br> 
3 operational , I would not take Ara=co public. I however would use it to raise money. = 
Q=A0 
=C24> 
I would take whatever steps necessary to bri=g the high knowledge base in tech, 
medicine, education to the Kingdom.410=A0 physically bring people there will NOT work. th=re is no need to have 
geographic limitations. ie the Chinese have seeded many people and cos in their dri=e to bolster their seat at the 
world financial table. SA can d= the same. Knowledge is the mobile valuable commodity, =C24k exchange oil for land, 
knowledge and currencies.
