The Business of College Sports in America

As we know sports in America is a business, whether i= be pro sports or amateur sports. And nowhere is it a business 
than in colleges where certain sports are a huge business.40=A0 The NCAA's annual men's basketball tournament, 
better known as March Madness, is both a great athletic contest and a crassly commercial enterprise —=a dichotomy 
common to college sports that has led to legal and ethical questions about =hether student athletes should be paid and 
organized like professional employees o= their universities. Even aside from the confused status of student athletes= 
college sports is burdened with myths. Here are five of the most common one=. Murray A. Sperber who teaches in the 
Cultural Studies of Sport in Education program in the University of California at Berkeley's Graduate School of Education 
and is the author of four b=oks on college sports wrote an interesting article last month in The Washington=Post — Five 
myths about college sports — is an attempt to a=dress some of the fuzziness. 
1. College sports provide enormous profits for schools. 
College athletic= generate eye-popping sums of money. The NCAA sold 14 years of N rights to its March tournament for 
$10.8 billion in 201=, and athletic programs routinely generate more than $20 million per year for=a school in ticket 
sales. In 2013, the University of Texas athletic departmen= pulled in $165.7 million. It's logical to think that the 
universiti=s' non-athletic programs benefit from all that money. Even the Chronicle of Hi=her Education has made the 
connection, writing that "there is no revenu= in training doctors and lawyers, [but] colleges and universities make a 
substantial, direct and immediate income from their student athletes.4>=9D 
In fact, most sc=ools lose money on their sports operations, as the NCAA confirms in its financial reports. Extravagant 
compensation for athletic department employees, especially coaches, as well as waste and mismanagement leave many 
programs in the red. In 2009, Duke's highl= successful men's basketball team lost $2 million , Florida Atlantic 
University=had a profit margin of minus 253.7 percent, and Louisiana Tech posted one of minu= 306.9 percent. Schools 
including Rice, Tulane and Colorado State all lost m=re than $1 million on their men's basketball programs that year.
