"Interest Rate". Why is it the greater of the Long Ter= AFR or LIBOR plus .25%. Why not just the Long Term 
AFR? 
"Note Obligations" includes "any indemnificati=n obligations under this Note." I did not see any 
"i=demnification" under the Note. I did see a requirement to pa= enforcement costs, but that is not an 
"indemnification".<=div> 
Section 3.2(b) - Requires the Payor to notify the Noteholder promptly =ut in any event no later than 5 business 
days upon the Payor becoming awar= of "any material adverse change in Payor's financial positi=n." What is a material 
adverse change? Too open en=ed .! 
Section 3.4 also makes reference to the Initial Net Worth statement pr=vided pursuant to Section 5.1 and 
requires the Payor, as of December 31 of each year, to maintain a Net Worth=of not less than 110% of the then 
outstanding principal amount. It d=fines net worth as total assets minus Leons total liabilities.? 
Section 3.5 prohibits the Payor from incurring "any liens o= any debt for bored money if the incurrence of any 
such debt or liens woul= have a material adverse effect on Payor's ability to make the pay=ents contemplated by this 
Note as such payments become due." "Material Adverse Effect" i= too vague and open-ended. 
Section 3.6 requires Payor to "furnish Noteholder with such=additional information as Noteholder shall 
reasonably request in order to =nable Noteholder to determine whether the terms, covenants, provisions 
and=conditions of this Note have been complied with by Payor." This seems like a very broad license to =equire Leon to 
provide info, particularly financial info, at any time.4>=A0 This is especially true when terms like "material adverse 
effect&q=ot; are used to trigger reporting obligations and violations of debt covenants. 
Section 6.2. Waivers of presentment, demand, protest, notice of =ntent to accelerate, notice of acceleration of 
maturity, notice of protest= notice of non-payment, except as are expressly provided in the Note are n=t unusual or 
overreaching, but they do limit Leon's defenses to enforcement actions. The consent=in Section 6.2(b) to "all waivers of 
any term hereof", is probably intend=d as a consent to the Noteholder waiving an enforcement term against the P=yor, 
but could be interpreted to mean that Payor even consents to waivers =f any term that provides the Payor with any 
protections like prior notice, for example. This should be modified to make it c=ear that it is only a consent to a waiver 
by the Noteholder of any enforce=ent term of the Note. 
Section 6.3 permits an assignment of the Note by the Noteholder withou= consent by the Payor. Leon's consent 
should be required if =he Notheolder wants to assign the note. 
Section 6.4 makes Leon responsible to pay any stamp or oth=r documentary taxes that are due in connection 
with the execution or deliv=ry of this Note. What are they? If there are none, then delete=this provision. 
Section 6.5 seems to make the Payor liable for the costs and expenses =f the Noteholder's "attempted 
enforcement" of the Note. That coul= be read to make Leon liable even if the Noteholder improperly commenced a= 
enforcement action and Leon won that case. It should only be payab=e if the Noteholder is the prevailing party. 
Moreover why not make this a reciprocal provision, so that if the Noteholder commences =ction and the Payor is the 
prevailing party then the Noteholder pays cost =nd expenses? Also, the Note provides that the Payor should pay the 
c=sts and expenses incurred in any workout? Why? 
Section 6.7 Jury Trial waiver is an attempt to exclude a jury from hea=ing a dispute over the Note because the 
amounts are so big, and that might=impact the ability to get a proper result. Why not arbitration?
