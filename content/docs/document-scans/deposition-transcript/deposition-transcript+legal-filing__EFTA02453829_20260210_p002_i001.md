Trial began on July 26 in U.S. District Court for Central District of California. On Aug. 10, Ruemmler and Isaacson summed 
up their opposing positions in closing arguments. 
Let =99s take a look. 
Isaacson, who did not re=pond to a request for comment, led with one of his strongest cards: USA! U=A! 
"We as a country, made up of flawed people, come together as one of the greatest countries on Earth, because we are a 
nation of laws," he s=id, according to a transcript of the proceedings. "This was about hard =ork and what happens when 
your work is destroyed and taken, how you're entitled to be treated under the laws of the United States."=br> For 
Ruemmler, the appeal was not emotional or ji=goistic. It was rational all the way. 
Her=first line: "Mr. Bajwa has come up with an interesting story, but =t's not what happened." 
And t=en, in the most matter-of-fact, conversational way, she annihilated his ca=e. 
"There are at least five fatal flaws in Mr. Bajwa's case, and any one of thos= alone sinks his case. Any one," she said, 
according to the transcr=pt. 
Bajwa couldn't prove that SpanCash was ever fully functional and commerc=ally ready, Ruemmler said. In fact, she 
argued, it was never even a real product. 
Further, she said, Bajwa didn't prove that the technology or platform was comprised of any t=ade secrets; or that 
Emirates Bank stole SpanCash; or that it ever used it. Finally, Bajwa didn't prove InfoSpan suffered any damages, she 
said= 
Some of her turns of phrase are refreshingly non-lawyerly. "Sham is goi=g down there... It's not as if these guys were 
exactly rubes =A6This is some flimflam thing... One of the many, many dog-ate-my-homework excuses=E2 .This is an 
absolute double-down lie." 
T=e overall effect: she simplified without being condescending. 
But there was still a hurdle for Emirates. Or as Latham's Schecter put=it in an interview, "There are some facts we 
wouldn't script.=E2 
After the bank terminated its agreement with InfoSpan and demanded its investment back, Infospan's deputy CEO, Larry 
Scudder, was arrested=when he tried to leave the UAE. 
"At th= Dubai Airport that day, the Dubai police arrested Mr. Scudder after he presented his passport at an electronic 
terminal. Police told Mr. Scudder that a charge of criminal fraud had been filed against him for $1,465,000. Mr. Scudder 
was handcuffed and marched through the airport and then held in police detention facilities and interrogated," the=20 
complaint states. 
He was handcuffed to a c=air, then transferred to a cell with 30 people before being released 19 hours later, a= 1 am. 
And =hen, the police kept his passport for six months before he could finally l=ave the country. 
On the stand, he cried w=en he spoke about the ordeal. 
Isaacson in his closing repeatedly called it extortion. "Because when the b=nk held Mr. Scudder's passport--I'm sorry, 
caused his passport to held= that just didn't cause personal pain for Mr. Scudder," he said.="What it did was give the 
opportunity for the bank to control the technology, to control the situation, because now InfoSpan couldn't compete in
