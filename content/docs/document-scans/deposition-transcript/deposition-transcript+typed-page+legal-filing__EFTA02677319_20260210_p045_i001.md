In this class, we will examine a series of pivotal humanitarian conflicts that involve both human 
rights neglect and degradation and inequitable distribution of natural resources. The course 
material will draw upon certain case examples from human rights hotspots in the developing world 
and here in the U.S. In our class discussions, we will consider various multidisciplinary 
approaches and definitions of the 'problem* and the 'solution.' We will learn about the vantage 
point of different affected communities, as well as actors from the political, social. economic and 
environmental disciplines. Unlike the typical 'environmental* discourse. our locus will be 
environmental justice. which encompasses: social equity and low income margjnalized 
populations that are often left out of the western agenda of environmentalism. Unfortunately, the 
affected communities that pay the heaviest price of environmental pollution and degradation have 
also reaped the least benefits and rewards of modernization and development. As reflected by 
the name of this course, we will be looking at the skills for making a certain type of affected 
change or improvement for the betterment of human populations in cases where communities. 
NGOs and state actors have built international alliances to affect change or an intervention. All 
the cases we are examining in class can be characterized by ongoing violence or political/human 
rights conflicts. Cases to be studied include: (a) petroleum resource wars in Iran and Nigeria. (b) 
the right to water in South Africa and Bolivia. (c) environmental justice and urban pollution in the 
United States, and (d) food policy and farmworker safety in India and California. This collaborative 
research seminar is a requirement for Global Studies Majors. but is open to all Bachelor Level 
students after completing at least 30 credits.

The U.S. resettles about 80.000 refugees annually of whom 35 to 40% are children. This 
collaborative research course introduces students to concepts related to forced migration with a 
focus on the experiences of refugee children. In the first part of the course we will read key texts 
which discuss the definition of refugee. refugee camp experiences. and the three permanent 
solutions for refugees outlined by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(VNHCR), with a particular emphasis on resettlement in third countries. Students will learn how the 
youth whom they will encounter In the service learning component of the class (see below) 
experience these transitions from being a resident of their country to becoming a refugee and then 
finding refuge In the US. Youth and their families are aided by Voluntary Agencies (Volags) to ease 
their transition to a new society. In the second part of the course we will discuss issues that are 
pertinent to refugee youth such as assimilation, acculturation, and the needs of Students with 
Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE). Ultimately the course will juxtapose theory and practice and 
by doing so. knowledge will be mutually reinforced and enriched. This course Is comprised of 
regular seminar meetings AND a substantial service learning component. Students will serve as 
tutors in the IRCs Youth Program for a minimum of 3 hours per week throughout the semester. 
Students will have some options regarding their volunteer sites (boroughs, ages and ethnicities of 
the children to be tutored). In this capacity they will see the innerworkings of programs designed 
to aid refugee youth's adjustment to their new environment and to succeed academically. Thus, 
they will be able to make connections between their experiences and observations and the 
theory/readings discussed in class. Given that students will work with youth all students have to 
undergo a background check administered by the IRC. In collaborative research projects, students 
will create a guide for school teachers to help them understand and assist their refugee (and 
immigrant) students better. For this project students will draw on existing research and data. In 
addition, students will collect data on challenges faced by refugee youth through participant 
observation in the service learning component and through semi-structured interviews with key 
informants such as IRC staff/teachers and selective refugee youth. The guide/Wog/report which 
the students will compile will include a theoretical section on forced migration and refugee 
resettlement and a practical part which will include suggestions on how to assist refugee children. 
Thus, the guide/blot/report will enable students to demonstrate their theoretical knowledge of 
issues related to refugees/immigrants as well as to demonstrate the knowledge which they have 
gained through volunteering with the IRC.

This course is designed for students interested in Sinoindian Interactions. We will cover the 
historical and contemporary exchanges between India and China Oven their dramatically different 
cultural, political• and historical experiences. We aim not only to understand the uniqueness of the 
connections between India and China. but also how the two civilizations have contributed to global 
exchanges and flows. The course will highlight similarities and differences between the two 
societies, their mutual perceptions, cultural exchanges and influences, patterns of development 
causes of conflict as well as possibilities for cooperation, and their role in world history and the 
contemporary global economy. In addition to reading primary and second materials. students will 
also study films and documentaries. NOTE: This is a graduate-level course offered in collaboration 
with the Graduate Program in International Affairs. Students should have completed at least 60 
credits with a B or better to register for this course. Contact gobalstudiesenewschootedu for
