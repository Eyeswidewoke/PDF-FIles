*baffle Cause Affidavit 
Palm Beach Police Department 
Agency ORIN FLU 500600 
On November 21, 2005 I interviewed-_ 
a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. 
stated 
he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. 
stated he 
was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for 
Epstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, 
stated they traveled with Epstein on his private 
plane. I asked Mr. 
about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. 
stated Epstein 
receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. 
stated that towards 
the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr= 
stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's 
bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things 
going on other than a msmage. 
stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he 
would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage. 
On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn 
taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from 
November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, 
chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about 
masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have 
one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated 
he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either 
or Epstein would 
meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen 
area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either 
or 
Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses 
appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. 
He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to 
for 
one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high 
school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators 
and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them 
away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's 
The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed 
before me this 1" day of May, 2006 by 
Det Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.
