=o Israel, as Brandt biographer Peter Merseburger reported. As those involv=d recall today, Brandt's decision was a 
"violation of the law" that Brandt's speechwriter, Klaus H=rpprecht, sought to justify by attributing the chancellor's 
actions to a s=-called emergency beyond law. The chancellor apparently saw it as an "=overriding obligation of the head 
of the German government" to rescue the country created by survivors of the Holocau=t. 
DID THE GERMAN GOVE=NMENT FINANCE THE ISRAELI NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM? 
In the 1960s, Israe='s interests had moved past conventional arms. Ben-Gurion had entrusted Pe=es with a highly 
sensitive project: Operation Samson, named after the Bibl=cal figure who is supposed to have lived at the time when the 
Israelites were being oppressed by the Philisti=es. Samson was believed to be invincible, but he was also seen as a 
destru=tive figure. The goal of the operation was to build an atomic bomb. The Is=aelis told their allies that they needed 
cheap nuclear energy for seawater desalination, and that they plann=d to use the water to make the Negev Desert 
fertile. 
The German governme=t was also left in the dark at first -- with Strauss being the likely exce=tion. The CSU politician 
was apparently brought into the loop in 1961. Thi= is suggested by a memo dated June 12, 1961, classified as "top 
secret," which Strauss dictated aft=r a meeting in Paris with Peres and Ben-Gurion, in which he wrote: "B=n-Gurion 
spoke about the production of nuclear weapons." 
One can speculate o= the reasons that Ben-Gurion, a Polish-born Israeli social democrat, chose=to include the Bavarian 
conservative Strauss in his plans. There are indic=tions that the Israeli government hoped to receive financial assistance 
for Operation Samson. 
Israel was cash-str=pped at the time, with the construction of the bomb consuming enormous sum= of money. This led 
Ben-Gurion to negotiate in great secrecy with Adenauer=over a loan worth billions. According to the German 
negotiation records, which the federal government has now re=eased in response to a request by SPIEGEL, Ben-Gurion 
wanted to use the lo=n for an infrastructure project in the Negev Desert. There was also talk o= a "sea water 
desalination plant." 
No Reason for Conce=n 
Plants for a civili=n desalination plant operated with nuclear power did in fact exist, and th= development of the Negev 
was also one of the largest projects in Israel's=brief history. When Rainer Barzel, the conservatives' parliamentary floor 
leader, inquired about the project =n Jerusalem, the Israelis explained that obtaining water through desalinat=on was an 
"epochal task." An official who accompanied Barzel not=d that the Israelis had said that "the necessary nuclear power 
would be monitored internationally and could not be used for=military purposes, and that we had no reason to be 
concerned."=/p> 
But a desalination =lant operated with nuclear power was never built, and it remains unclear w=at exactly happened 
with the total of 630 million deutsche marks that Germ=ny gave the Israelis in the period until 1965. The payments were 
processed by the Frankfurt-based Kreditansta=t fur Wiederaufbau (Reconstruction Credit Institute). The head of the 
or=anization said in internal discussions that the use of the funds was "=never audited." "Everything seems to suggest 
that the Israeli bomb was financed also with German money," says Avne= Cohen, an Israeli historian at the Monterey 
Institute of International St=dies in California who studies nuclear weapons. 
Finally, in 1967, l=rael had probably built its first nuclear weapon. The Israeli government d=smissed questions about its 
nuclear arsenal with a standard response that =terns from Peres: "We will not introduce nuclear weapons to the region, 
and certainly we will not be the first.&quo=; This deliberately vague statement is still the Israeli government's offi=ial 
position today. 
When dealing with t=eir German allies, however, Israeli politicians used language that hardly =oncealed the truth. When 
the legendary former Defense Minister Moshe Dayan=visited Bonn in the fall of 1977, he told then Chancellor Helmut
