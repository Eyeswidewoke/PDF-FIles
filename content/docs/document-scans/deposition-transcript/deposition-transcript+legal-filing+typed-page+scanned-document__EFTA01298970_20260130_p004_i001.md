Epstein's house arrest challenges guidelines: Many departures from state regulations OK'd 
by court or probation officer. Palm Beach Daily News July 4, 2010 Sunday 
Frick had contacted the probation supervisor, who said, in his opinion, it was a probation 
violation. 
Dressed in sweat pants and a white T-shirt, Epstein told Frick he was walking to his West 
Palm Beach office and was allowed to do so by his probation officer, Carmen Sloan. 
Frick asked Epstein why he was not on a direct route to work. Epstein said he had walked 
to the north bridge [Flagler Memorial Bridge], but it was too busy and now was headed to 
the middle bridge (Royal Park Bridge]. 
Frick said Epstein did not have a copy of his weekly schedule, which the supervisor said 
he should have with him. 
After speaking with Sloan, the supervisor told Frick that Sloan had given permission for 
Epstein to walk to work at this time of day and she did not consider it a violation. Frick 
released Epstein without arrest. 
Police contact probation officer 
The next day, Frick spoke directly with Sloan. 
"I then questioned Sloan as to why he could be so far off a direct route and how much 
detail was included in this weekly schedule. She advised there was not much detail on the 
schedule or about the route. I advised Sloan that in order to avoid ongoing problems with 
Epstein that I would need a copy of his weekly schedule and these schedules would have 
to be more detailed. I further advised her that, based on my observations, this was a clear 
violation of his community control and, that absent her involvement yesterday, Epstein 
would have been arrested for VOP [violation of parole]." 
Notations by Sloan in the file show she told Frick it would be too difficult to provide him 
with Epstein's weekly schedules because they often change and wouldn't necessarily be 
accurate. 
"At Officer Sloan's discretion, he was walking to work as his exercise, as he was not 
allowed to swim or go to the gym," Rackleff said via e-mail. 
When asked about the discrepancy in his daily log entry for Aug. 19, Rackleff said, 
"Unfortunately, we cannot answer this one today, it looks like there is a second entry on 
the log in the evening of 8/19/09, but we cannot make out what it says. (The supervising 
officer at that time was CPSO Sloan and she is out on extended leave). The case notes do 
not specify what time the police saw him." 
Assistant State Attorney Skiles said, "We evaluate information that comes to the office 
about compliance. We do not have primary compliance responsibility. That responsibility 
rests with the probation office." 
Traveling outside state 
Records show that Epstein traveled nearly every week to either his home in New York City 
or his private island, Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, during the first four months 
of this year. His probation officers have issued him travel permits for each trip in 
accordance with a Dec. 18 court order by Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath.
