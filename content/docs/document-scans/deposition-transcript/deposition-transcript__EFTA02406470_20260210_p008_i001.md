GOLDBERG: Is there anything you could do to move it faster? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, nothing that I can tell you, because your cla=sified clearance isn't good enough. (Laughter.) 
This is part of, by the way, the context in which we have to examine our ap=roach toward Iran, because at a time when 
there is not a lot of sympathy f=r Iran and its only real ally is on the ropes, do we want a distraction in=which suddenly 
Iran can portray itself as a victim, and deflect attention from what has to be the core iss=e, which is their potential 
pursuit of nuclear weapons? That's an ex=mple of factors that -- when we are in consultation with all our allies, 
i=cluding the Israelis, we raise these factors, because this is an issue of many dimensions here, and we've got t= factor all 
of them in to achieve the outcome that hopefully we all want.<=r> 
GOLDBERG: Do the Israelis understand that? There have been disagreem=nts between Israel and the U.S. before, but 
this is coming to a head about=what the Israelis see as an existential issue. The question is: In your mi=d, have you 
brought arguments to Netanyahu that have so far worked out well? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think that in the end, Israel's leaders will make=determinations based on what they believe is best 
for the security of Isra=l, and that is entirely appropriate. 
When we present our views and our strategy approach, we try to put all our =ards on the table, to describe how we are 
thinking about these issues. We =ry to back those up with facts and evidence. We compare their assessments =ith ours, 
and where there are gaps, we try to narrow those gaps. And what I also try to do is to underscore th= seriousness with 
which the United States takes this issue. And I think th=t Ehud Barak understands it. I think that Prime Minister 
Netanyahu, hopefu=ly when he sees me next week, will understand it. 
And one of the things that I like to remind them of is that every single co=mitment I have made to the state of Israel and 
its security, I have kept. = mean, part of your -- not to put words in your mouth -- but part of the u=derlying question is: 
Why is it that despite me never failing to support Israel on every single problem th=t they've had over the last three 
years, that there are still questions ab=ut that? 
GOLDBERG: That's a good way to phrase it. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And my answer is: there is no good reason to doubt =e on these issues. 
Some of it has to do with the fact that in this country and in our media, t=is gets wrapped up with politics. And I don't 
think that's any secret. And=if you have a set of political actors who want to see if they can drive a =edge not between 
the United States and Israel, but between Barack Obama and a Jewish American vote that has h=storically been very 
supportive of his candidacy, then it's good to try to=fan doubts and raise questions. But when you look at the record, 
the=e's no "there" there. And my job is to try to make sure that those political factors are washed away on an iss=e that 
is of such great strategic and security importance to our two count=ies. And so when I'm talking to the prime minister, or 
my team is talking =o the Israeli government, what I want is a hardheaded, clear-eyed assessment of how do we achieve 
our goa=s. And our goals are in sync. And historically, one of the reasons t=at the U.S.-Israeli relationship has survived 
so well and thrived is share= values, shared history, the links between our peoples. But it's also been because it has been 
a profoundly bipartisa= commitment to the state of Israel. And the flip side of it is that, in to=ms of Israeli politics, 
there's been a view that regardless of whether it'= a Democratic or Republican administration, the working assumption 
is: we've got Israel's back. And that's something t=at I constantly try to reinforce and remind people of. 
GOLDBERG: Wait, in four words, is that your message to the prime min=ster -- we've got Israel's back? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That is not just my message to the prime minister, =hat's been my message to the Israeli people, 
and to the pro-Israel communi=y in this country, since I came into office. It's hard for me to be cleare= than I was in front 
of the UN General Assembly, when I made a more full-throated defense of Israel and i=s legitimate security concerns 
than any president in history -- not, by th= way, in front of an audience that was particularly warm to the message. S= 
that actually won't be my message. My message will be much more specific, about how do we solve this 
problem.=/span>
