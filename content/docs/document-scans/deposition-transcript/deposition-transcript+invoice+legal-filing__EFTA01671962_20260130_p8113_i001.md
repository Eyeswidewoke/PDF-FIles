Information on Pay Over Time Features 
There is no pre-set spending limit on your Card 
No pre-set spending limit does not mean unlimited spending. Purchasing power adjusts with your use of the Card, 
your payment history, credit record and financial resources known to us and other factors. Unless you have been 
previously notified otherwise, your Card has a no pre-set spending limit. 
There is a limit to your Pay Over Time feature balance 
Your Pay Over Time limit is S35,000.00. We may approve or decline a charge regardless of whether your Card 
account balance exceeds or does not exceed your Pay Over Time limit. You must pay in full all charges that are not 
placed into a Pay Over lime balance upon receipt of your billing statement.

Your Account renews next month. The following terms will be in effect when your Account renews, unless we tell 
you otherwise. Please refer to Page 2 for more information about your Account, Including How We Calculate Your

Payment Information: All charges made on this charge card, that are not included in a Pay Over lime balance, are

Annual Membership Fee: The annual membership fee for your Account is $2,500.00. When you receive the

APR Information: The Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) for each billing period may vary based on the Prime Rate. 
We use the Prime Rate published In the rates section of The Wall Street Journal 2 days before the Closing Date of the 
billing period. The Wall Street Journal may not publish the Prime Rate on that day. If it does not, we will use the Prime 
Rate from the previous day it was published. 
The Penalty APR may apply to a Feature If you make one or more late payments or If your payment Is retumed. We 
may also consider your creditworthiness in determining whether or not to apply the penalty APR to the Pay Over 
Time feature(s) on your Account. If the Penalty APR is applied, it will apply for at least 6 months. We will review your 
Account every 6 months after the Penalty APR is applied. The Penalty APR will continue to apply until you have 
made timely payments with no returned payments during the 6 months being reviewed. 
You may have access to one or more Pay Over Time Features on your Account. The following APRs apply to the 
Features noted as of the Closing Date of this statement. (v) indicates variable rate.
