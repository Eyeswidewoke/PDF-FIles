friend. 
There is no doubt that EPSTEIN is very intelligent and 
can carry a conversation about any subject but there is something 
about him that is weird and off•putting. He is incredibly wealthy 
and COUTURIER believes that most people around him do not talk too 
much about him because that type of wealth usually buys power. 
Although people might have information about EPSTEIN they might be 
reluctant to talk: it is easier to excuse his bad behavior or turn 
a blind eye to it. 
COUTURIER stated that about six or seven months ago a 
woman by the name of 
who is EPSTEIN's assistant. 
called him and asked if he would consider taking on the challenge 
of decorating EPSTEIN's place in Manhattan and if he would also 
consider decorating his place in the US Virgin Islands (USVO. 
COUTURIER advised these are just two of the homes he currently owns 
but EPSTEIN also has an apartment in Paris, France and a huge ranch 
somewhere in the Midwest in the U.S. 
COUTURIER stated that by this time, he had heard of 
EPSTEIN's incarceration and thought that EPSTEIN had 'paid his debt 
to society' and maybe things had changed with him so he went into 
the meeting trying to be objective. EPSTEIN also stated that to be 
honest, he would be making a lot of money if he look the project. 
The first meeting took place sometime in April or May 
2010 and 
EPSTEIN's assistant. showed him the overall 
plans of the USVI house. Although EPSTEIN was supposed to attend 
the meeting he could not make it so LEWIS handled it 
Ten days later, EPSTEIN, 
and his other assistant 
LAST NAME UNKNOWN (LNU) all flew from Palm Beach. FL to the 
house on the USVI after the initial meeting. 
Sometime in June 2010, COUTURIER and EPSTEIN plus his 
assistants, flew to the USVI on EPSTEIN's private plane. They took 
it from Palm Beach to the island and stayed there for a day and a 
half. EPSTEIN was very excited and appeared to be like a kid with 
a new toy. COUTURIER recalls that EPSTEIN kept the house very cold 
and his bedroom was white but had no lights in the room. it was 
dark and very austere. The focal point of the room was an enormous 
bed. 
EPSTEIN also showed him another room in which he wanted 
to place four beds and wanted to have It decorated in a very 
colorful palette for his guts. EPSTEIN told COUTURIER him that he 
does not have any friends and that he does not really like people. 
EPSTEIN stated that he has girls coming to spend time with him in 
the island. EPSTEIN then lamented that She girls- are only 
interested in Facebook and MySpace and that he wanted the space in 
this bedroom to be comfortable and have access to the Internet as 
they were onine so much. COUTURIER dud not ask how old these 
girls were or anything about them. He did not ask him any personal
