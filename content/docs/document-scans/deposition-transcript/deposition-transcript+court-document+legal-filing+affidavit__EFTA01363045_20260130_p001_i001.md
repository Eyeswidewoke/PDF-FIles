ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS 
NOT AN OFFER AND CONFIDENTIAL: This communication is provided for your internal use only. The information contained herein is proprietary and confidential to Harvest Volatility Management 
ILC (the "Adviser") and may not be disclosed to third parties or duplicated or used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it has been provided. Although the information provided herein 
has been obtained from sources which the Adviser believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy, and such information may be incomplete or condensed. The information is subject to 
change without notice. This communication is for information purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any security or of any fund or 
account (the "Fund or Account") the Adviser manages or offers. Since we furnish all Information as part of a general Information service and without regard to your particular circumstances, the 
Adviser shall not be liable for any damages arising out of any inaccuracy in the Information. 
THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD NOT BE THE BASIS Of AN INVESTMENT DECISION: An investment decision should be based on your customary and thorough due diligence procedures, which should 
include, but not be limited to, a thorough review of all relevant term sheets and other offering documents as well as consolation with legal, tax and regulatory experts. My person subscribing for an 
investment must be able to bear the risks involved and must meet the particular Fund or Account's suitability requirements. Some or all alternative investment programs may not be suitable for 
certain investors. No assurance can be given that any Fund or Account will meet Its investment objectives or avoid losses. A discussion of some, but not all, of the risks associated with Investing in the 
Fund or Account can be found in the Fund or Account's private placement memoranda, subscription agreement, limited partnership agreement, articles of association or other offering documents as 
applicable (collectively the "Offering Documents"), among those risks, which we wish to call to your attention, are the following: 
FUTURE LOOKING STATEMENTS, PERFORMANCE DATA AND STRATEGY LEVEL PERFORMANCE REPORTING: The Information In this report is NOT intended to contain or express exposure 
recommendations, guidelines or limits applicable to a Fund or Account. The information In this report does not disclose or contemplate the hedging or exit strategies of the Fund or Account. While 
investors should understand and consider risks associated with position concentrations when making an investment decision, this report is not intended to aid an investor in evaluating such risk. The 
terms set forth in the Offering Documents are controlling in all respects should they conflict with any other term set forth in other marketing materials, and therefore, the Offering Documents must 
be reviewed carefully before making an Investment and periodically while an Investment is maintained. Statements made in this release Include forward•looking statements. These statements, 
Including those relating to future financial expectations, involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward•looking statements. Unless 
otherwise indicated, performance data is presented unaudited and "net" of management fees and other Fund or Account expenses (i.e. legal and accounting and other expenses as disclosed in the 
relevant Fund or Account's Offering Documents') and net of performance allocations. Due to the format of data available for the time periods indicated, both gross and net returns are difficult to 
calculate precisely. Accordingly, the calculations have been made based on in some cases limited available data and a number of assumptions. Because of these limitations, the performance 
information should not be relied upon as a precise reporting of gross or net performance, but rather merely a general indication of past performance. 
THE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN MAY HAVE BEEN GENERATEDDURING A PERIODOF EXTRAORDINARY MARKET VOLATILITY OR RELATIVE STABILITY IN A PARTICULAR 
SECTOR: Accordingly, the performance is not necessarily indicative of results that the Fund or Account may achieve in the future. In addition, the foregoing results may be based or shown on an 
annual basis, but results for individual months or quarters within each year may have been more favorable or less favorable than the results for the entire period, as the case may be. If index 
information Is Included, It Is merely to show the general trend in the markets in the periods indicated and is not intended to imply that the portfolio was similar to the indices in either composition or 
element of risk. This report may indicate that it contains hypothetical or actual performance of specific strategies employed by The Adviser, such strategies may comprise only a portion of any 
specific Fund or Account's portfolio, and, therefore, the reported strategy level performance may not correspond to the performance of any Fund or Account for the reported time period. 
INVESTMENT RISKS: Investing in the Fund or Account is speculative and involves varying degrees of risk, including substantial degrees of risk in some cases. The Fund or Account may be leveraged 
and may engage in other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Past results of the Fund or Account investment manager is not necessarily indicative of future 
performance of the Fund or Account, and the Fund or Account's performance may be volatile. The use of a single advisor could mean lack of diversification and, consequently, higher risk. The Fund 
or Account may have varying liquidity provisions and limitations. There is no secondary market for investors' interests in the Fund or Account and none is expected to develop. 
NOT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING OR REGULATORY ADVICE: This material is not intended to represent the rendering of accounting, tax, legal or regulatory advice. A change in the facts or circumstances of 
any transaction could materially affect the accounting, tax, legal or regulatory treatment for that transaction. The ultimate responsibility for the decision on the appropriate application of accounting, 
tax, legal and regulatory treatment rests with the Investor and his or her accountants, tax and regulatory counsel. Potential Investors should consult, and must rely on their own professional tax, legal 
and investment advisors as to matters concerning the Fund or Account and their investments in the Fund or Account. Prospective investors should inform themselves as to: (1) the legal requirements 
within their own jurisdictions for the purchase, holding or disposal of investments; (2) and applicable foreign exchange restrictions; and (3) any income and other taxes which may apply to their 
purchase, holding and disposal of investments or payments in respect of the investments of the Fund or Account.
