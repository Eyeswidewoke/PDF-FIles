later in the interview to resolve the contradictions. Some researchers have mistakenly interpreted 
the "report everything" instruction to mean that witnesses should guess if unsure (Memon, Wark, 
Bull, & Koehnken, 1997). This misinterpretation violates the spirit of the CI, which discourages 
witnesses from guessing. The "report everything" instruction merely directs witnesses to give 
expression to events when they think of them, while they are temporarily accessible. This 
freedom to report events in an unconstrained order should further confer a sense of informational 
control to witnesses. 
Non-verbal Output. Interviewers and respondents often use only the verbal medium to 
communicate. Some people, however, can express themselves more effectively non-verbally, and 
some events are easier to describe non-verbally (Leibowitz, Guzy, Peterson, & Blake, 1993). 
Ideally the response format should be compatible with the witness's mental record of the event, 
thereby minimizing the need to transform the mental record into an overt response (Greenwald, 
1970). If an event is inherently spatial, (e.g., the location of objects within a room) then 
witnesses should respond spatially, by drawing a sketch of the room or by placing model objects 
within a (model) room. Similarly, if the event to be described is an action, witnesses may find it 
easier to enact the event than to describe it verbally. 
Validation Testing of the CI 
The CI was developed initially to enhance witness memory, rather than for therapeutic purposes. 
Therefore, most of the formal validation testing has examined the CI's ability to increase the 
amount and quality of witness recollection. Only recently have we thought of the CI as a way to 
promote victims' psychological well being, and hence, we can report only some anecdotal 
evidence that bears on the relation between the CI and Therapeutic Jurisprudence. 
The CI as an information-gathering technique has been tested in approximately 100 laboratory 
tests, most of which were conducted in the United States, England, Germany or Australia. In 
these studies, volunteer witnesses (usually college students) observed either a live, innocuous 
event or a videotape of a simulated crime. Shortly thereafter (ranging from a few hours to several 
days), the witnesses were interviewed by a trained researcher—or in some cases by experienced 
police officers—who conducted either a CI or a control interview. The control interview was 
either modeled after a typical police interview or after a generally accepted interview protocol, 
e.g., the Memorandum of Good Practice (1992). Across these studies, the CI typically elicited 
between 25 % - 40% more correct statements than did the control interview. The effect is 
extremely reliable: Of the 55 experiments examined in a meta-analysis (Koehnken, Milne, 
Memon, & Bull, 1999), 53 experiments found that the CI elicited more information than did the 
comparison interview (median increase = 34%). Equally important, accuracy was as high or 
slightly higher in the CI interviews (accuracy rate = .85) than in the comparison interviews (.82). 
All of the above studies were conducted in the laboratory, with non-threatening events. Two 
other studies have examined the CI with victims and witnesses of real-world crimes. In these 
field studies, one conducted in the United States (Fisher, Geiselman, & Amador 1989) and one
