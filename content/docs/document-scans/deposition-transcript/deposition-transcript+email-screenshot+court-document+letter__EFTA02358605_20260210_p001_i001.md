Fwd: taxes 
Dear Jeffrey, 
We don81=93 have the trust document. I am going to ask Noam to request it. <My> The whole situation is extremely 
unfair to Noam. 
Noa= hasn't been receiving anything from the trust, nor has he been inform=d if they are depositing the interest of the 
trust in some account that we=are not aware of. 
Noam understands that he has rights as well to=the principal of the trust, and requested money only to pay half of the 
to=es to not have to take 200k from the IRA (income taxes have been paid from=the IRA, besides all our expenses, 
increasing the withdrawals from the IRA=, but the condition the children established (one of them as the tru =tee) to 
give Noam any access to the marital trust is that he has to disclo=e all our financial life to them, something that Noam 
totally opposes and =e too. Our lawyer tried to obtain half of the taxes amount again this year=from the trust, but the 
trustee denied for the second year. The lawyer had=told me, in privacy, that the situation is very serious -- children 
denyin= their father his own money, money he earned from his work. 
But Noam doesn't accept their conditions exactly because the money is=still his (they are the beneficiaries) and he never 
asked the children to =isclose their financial lives to give them money. I agree that we do='t have to live under their 
surveillance, as they want. Noam dec=ded not access the trust. I totally agreed. And we decided to =djust our lives 
accordingly. 
The 30k is not the problem. The pro=lem is that they seem to want to punish Noam for remarrying (maybe 
unconsc=ously), although Noam thinks that they are happy about our marriage. =To give you an example, even one book 
that Noam decided to give me the cop=right, it was angrily questioned. And Noam answered that the same wa= he has 
given to them, to their trusts and to his first wife (their mother=, he is going to give to me from now on. There are many 
other things that =ave been going on since we got married. But I have been trying -- as much =s I can -- to disregard 
everything because I love Noam and want us to be h=ppy. But it hasn't been easy.

I understand. the marital trust document ? =AO if he is required to pay interest to the trust and receive it back =A0 
that means that he is a beneficialry of the trust.. i= it is the 30k . I will pay it myself. no problem. =C2 his health is 
most important. will he allow me to talk t= them or their representative. . or my very kind gently =erson called rich 
kahn that works for me in these situations. = I think the whole situaiton is very unfair to noam. =AO and would like to 
take part in its solution. valeria = this is what i do , it is not a burden nor should you both feel in =ny way awkward 
about it.
