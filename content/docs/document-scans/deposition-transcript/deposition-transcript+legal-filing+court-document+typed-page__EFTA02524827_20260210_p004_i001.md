our sales are slow, last year Apes Hill Club made $33 million=net profit. However, because the cash flow was needed 
for=20 continued development in Apes Hill, none of the money was brought bac= to Landmark. 
Obviously, if we have a completely integrated management staff and=20 presently no income from our 
two major developments, we have a cash f=ow problem. A year ago I believed that recession was on=20 us, things 
would be bad, and Landmark would be (if I could keep the t=am together) in an ideal position to take advantage of the 
greatest fina=cial crisis in my lifetime. Therefore, I made the decision=20 not to cut management back to what was 
necessary for Barbados and Sou=h Padre, but to use it to look for new opportunities and to be prepared=to become a 
major player when the market foreclosed on what I knew would=be billions of dollars of distressed assets. 
This year we have entered into a contract for the development of a distres=ed golf project in St. Lucia. 
We have reached agreement=20 with the government of St. Kitts to start up, again, a resort project=on the west coast 
of St. Kitts that had been abandoned because of mismanagement and corruption, and we are at the contact stage of 
ente=ing into agreement on a 5,000 acre development in North Carolina where th= owners need management and they 
need the ability to attract some mone= on a last-in, first-out basis, and we are closely following a half dozen=20 other 
distressed properties. 
In order to meet our negative cash requirements, we have exhausted our c=sh reserve, we have 
scrambled where possible, and I have borrowed over $= million personally and put it into the company. A few=20 
months ago, a government bank for the eastern Caribbean, originally=20 started by the World Bank, agreed to loan 
Landmark $5 million.=A0 The security for the loan would be the 100% of the St. Lucia=20 company that owns one-third 
of Apes Hill Club in Barbados. =20 That one-third interest is worth somewhere between $20 million=and $50 million; 
however, it is not the type of security that you can lev=rage in the U.S. I am told that this loan has been approved by 
the Board of Directors and I will be able to draw funds t=e first of June; however, since I have received no written 
confirmation=of this to-date, I am naturally concerned. 
How I Would Like to Use Your Mind — If Allowed 
1. 
If I obtain the $5 million loan, While I am a real estate ma= and know little of financial posturing, 
the best idea I have heard is=to use Landmark as a platform company to become a leader in the manageme=t and 
resurrection of a few of these foreclosed assets, and in 5 to 7 y=ars when the profits can be realized from this financial 
disaster, with t=e tax loss used and the reputation enhanced, to go public as a branded=20 community developer much 
as Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons are thought=of as branded hotel operators. The idea would be to have=20 an 
institution or individual, or institutions and individuals, invest=$15 million to $20 million in convertible preferred stock in 
Landmark. If after 3 years they decided to convert,=20 they would own approximately the same amount as the Barton 
family, however, this is simply one of I am sure many ways it could be done a=d I know no one who, if you were willing, 
could give me better guidance. 
2. 
If, in fact, my unfounded worries abou= the consummation of this $5 million loan are justified, I will 
need to ve=y quickly see if I can borrow $3 million to $5 million on the one-third=20 security of Apes Hill and be able to 
keep the management team togethe= for perhaps another year. If that is not possible, I will=20 quickly reduce the staff
