My own view is different. To me the proposal I suggested =eems to be a very 
simple way of settling this matter, which to me is extre=ely troubling. I realize that this is just another case of a 
longsta=ding difference in the way we approach these problems, a difference that h=s been clear ever since we were 
discussing the interest on the loan from t=e Trust and found that we could not communicate because I mistakenly 
assum=d that it was a discussion among family members while your letters made it=very clear and explicit that you saw 
it as a legal issue to be settled amo=g lawyers and Bainco, perhaps with a mediator in the adversary proceeding.=C2* 
All matters I find it very hard to comprehend, and to live with, but=so be it. 
So by all means consult with your lawyer, or perh=ps a battery of lawyers, to 
make sure that your interests are properly pro=ected. I don't need any lawyer's advice. The matter is=perfectly clear 
and straightforward. So there is no reason for me to= hire a lawyer to deal with the question and to have a lawyer 
contact yours=and initiate a discussion in which we all participate. 
The =atter is very simple. We can proceed without delay if you agree to s=ttle 
the issue in the simple manner that I suggested. 
As fo= your proposals in your letter of March 29, as I wrote you, the letter 
was=so shocking that it was hard for me to bring myself to respond, but I did,=in detail, but decided not to send it. 
Perhaps I should. Will =hink about it. 
As for your proposals, my response was the o=vious one. I'm sorry for the stress 
you had to endure, but your =fforts were a waste of time for reasons I had already fully explained befo=e you undertook 
them. As I'm sure you recall, a few years ago, l=requested tax payments from the marital trust when my IRA was being 
rapidl= depleted by my advisers who were distributing half to family and using th= other half to pay management fees 
and taxes for the entire estate, so tha= to pay Alex's medical expenses and the expenses for Wellfleet I had t= withdraw 
excess funds with exorbitant taxes, all that before withdrawing =ven a cent to live on again with exorbitant taxes. Your 
response was=to refuse the request unless I agreed to intrusive and insulting financial=investigations -- of a kind I never 
considered when providing funds to you=for something you needed. I made it clear and explicit at the time t=at I would 
not submit to this procedure. Since your efforts and prop=sals simply repeat the same procedure, they were a waste of 
time. 
There were some things in your letter that were correct. You84=9;re right that 
despite what has happened, I'm still a "wealthy m=n," with income well above the median, though lacking a pension and 
a=cumulated property, not at the level of my peers. Furthermore, I can=supplement my income by teaching large 
undergraduate courses, something l&=39;d never done and that is not that common for people approaching 90, 
but=something that I enjoy. And you too are a wealthy man, for the same =easons: the reasons are that I've worked 
hard all my life, lived fairl= simply (and live even more simply today), and was therefore able to put a=ide enough money 
to ensure that my children and grandchildren are very wel= cared for, indefinitely. 
But I again suggest t=at we put all of this aside, and deal quickly and simply with 
what appears=to be the one outstanding issue: dividing the Marital trust and then disso=ving it, all very simple, needing 
no lawyers, at least on my part.
