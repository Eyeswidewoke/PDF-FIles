The amount of such all-risk ground and flight aircraft hull insurance at no time and in no event 
shall be less than Three Million Four Hundred Fifty-four Thousand United States Dollars 
(USS3,454,000.00). In the case of public liability, the amount thereof maintained shall in no 
event be less than Ten Million United States Dollars (USSI 0,000,000.00) with physical damage 
or liability coverage deductibles not to exceed Ten Thousand United States Dollars 
(USSI 0,000.00) or as mutually agreed by Lender and Mortgagor; provided, however, if the 
aircraft is operated under a Pan 135 certificate, then in no event shall such insurance coverage be 
less than Fifty Million United States Dollars (USS50,000,000.00) or as mutually agreed by 
Lender and Mortgagor. All insurance required to be maintained by this Paragraph 3.4 shall be 
maintained in effect with financially sound and reputable insurers reasonably satisfactory to 
Lender and shall be evidenced by one (I) or more policies, each of which shall provide: 
(i) 
in the case of all-risk ground and flight aircraft hull insurance that 
Lender is designated as a loss payee (but without imposing upon Lender any obligation 
imposed upon the insured, including, without limitation, the liability to pay the premiums 
of such policies), and that, in the event of any damage or loss to the Aircraft or any 
Engine, all payments shall be made to Lender at its address: 
WELLS FARGO EQUIPMENT FINANCE, INC. 
733 Marquette Avenue, Suite 700 
MAC N9306-070 
Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402 
(ii) 
in the case of public liability and property damage insurance, that 
Lender is an additional named insured (but without imposing upon Lender any 
obligation, including, without limitation, the liability to pay the premiums for such 
policies), and that all of the provisions thereof shall operate in the same manner as if 
there were a separate policy covering each insured (provided that such policies shall 
operate in the same manner as if there were a separate policy covering each insured); 
(iii) 
that, as against Lender, the insurer waives any rights of 
subrogation, set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by attachment or 
otherwise; 
(iv) 
that, in respect of the interest of Lender in such policy or policies, 
the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of Mortgagor or of any 
other Person (other than Lender) and shall insure Lender regardless of any breach or 
violation by Mortgagor or any other Person (other than Lender) of any warranties, 
declarations or conditions contained in such policies; and 
(v) 
that, if such insurance is canceled for any reason whatsoever or 
changes in any material respect in relation to the interest of Lender or is allowed to lapse 
for nonpayment of premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as 
to Lender for thirty (30) days after receipt by Lender of written notice by the insurer of 
such cancellation, change or lapse. All proceeds of insurance policies required to be in
