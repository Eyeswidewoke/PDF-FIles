=div>As the stories get wilder and the writers make the girls younger= prostitution is a tabloid 
s dream , . =1 wondered if having something out in the cyber world that let some =eople point to rational arguments 
might allow some to defend themsel=es from their wives . " how could you " etc.=C2 
I =have been exploring the Al world with the cutting edge people. =1 remind them of your 
comments re machines thinking :W=C2 
I thought that culture was the c=nciousness of a society. tribes were like 
self. .=C2 media approx transmitters. . It provided con=traints and rules for some underlying interactions. 
1= doesnt exist in a physical sense but either does concio=sness. which it appears to me as an 
evolutionary advantage and=C2 provides the brain with rules memories. ( culture again = . and constraints. . tribes 
when attacked , act =ike a self . . compete like selves. etc. The world we c=ll physical . follows rules that we have 
created, most unknowingly. =C2 
I assume language acts like an effective transmittier.=C2 . some language like 
adrenaline. some like dopam=ne. . do some extent the hormones of the culture. ? =A0
