&nbs=; For decades I've argued with Howard Stern about Paul McCart=ey. One of my regrets about leaving the 
show was that Paul was finally a guest two month= after my much-maligned departure and has made fairly regular 
appearances=20 since. 
&nbs=; I'd heard from multiple sources ... one being the lat= Noel Redding, bassist in the Jimi Hendrix Experience, a 
guest on the Stern show multiple=20 times, who loved my joke tapes and would always tell me he and Paul and th=ir 
wives had spent hours telling jokes at dinner the night before 
heard that Paul loves jokes, dirty jokes of course, 
telling them and hearing them. An= joke tellers love to hang with me, which has nothing to do with anything other=than 
if they don't already know they very quickly realize they'=e going to walk away with a few new ones, a few great ones. 
&nbs=; So I've always maintained that if I got to spend five or te= minutes with McCartney that he'd both enjoy me 
and want to connect with me simp=y because he'd realize I'm a terrific source for jokes.</=> 
I know that. Joke tellers have a=20 connection. It's a bond that crosses all barriers, much like peopl= who like to 
play hockey or who follow the Jets. It's a very strong common denominator. 
&nbs=; Thanks to my pal Tom Bernard, the co-president of Sony Pictures Cla=sics, I'm on the event invitation list of 
eminent PR guru Peggy Siegal=and last night, November 20, 2015 (an important date for me as I crossed something off 
my=Bucket List) the lovely Barbara Klein and I were at MOMA for a screening of the=20 incredible film "The Big Short." 
&nbs=; The revelers at the cocktail hour before the screening was an eclec=ic group ... the film's producer Lorne 
Michaels, the film4,=99s director Adam McCay, actress Candice Bergen ... and a host of many folks I'm sure=l should 
have recognized but didn't. 
&nbs=; No sooner had Barbara said to me, "I want to do something=fun in here ..." (she's so great) in walked Paul 
McCartney and his wife Nancy Sheve.l. 
&nbs=; I said to Barbara, "You realize for decades I've wa=ted to tell jokes with him, right?" 
&nbs=; She said, "Well, then, you've got to go do it.Q=804, 
&nbs=; I said, "Man, I'd love to. But I'm sure the=e's not a person in here who doesn't think they've got a perfectly 
legitimate reason to=approach Sir Paul and strike up a conversation. And that'd be crummy. He and his lady sh=uld be 
able to meander the party unencumbered, that's what New York City is al= about." 
&nbs=;Of course she knew that. And of course as I said it my mind was racing, think=ng about all the near-misses 
I've had trying to get in his presence=to fire off a few. 
&nbs=; As if we willed it, almost right away here comes Paul and Nancy, wa=king toward us, smiling and nodding 
and saying polite "hello's=E244 as they were upon us.
