us $18 to create and sold 60% for$6 B we collected 60% and 70% of our money already just a little under $4B 
,you can read the following article from one of the buyers 
More World's GB island owner changes plan amid downtum(Alex Delmar-Morgan) Thursday, 17th September 
2009The owner of the $60m Great Britain island on The World archipelago in Dubai has said plans to develop 
the 11-acre plot have changed amid the global downturn. Safi Qurashi, who bought Great Britain for $60m in 
May 2008 — making it one of the most expensive sandbanks in the world - last year he said he would build a mix 
of residential, hotels and commercial projects to reflect British architecture. Now he has admitted the island will 
be "slightly different" to suit current market conditions. Plans to develop The World's Moscow, which he bought 
for $58m in March last year, are on hold, he added. Construction on Qurashi's Great Britain island is to start 
immediately after Ramadan, which ends on the weekend, he said. He said the first phase could be completed 
within four months - but declined to reveal what was being planned. "We are about to start work on the island 
and are waiting for the final drawings and plans to be stamped. It's quite an exciting project,' the London-born 
property entrepreneur told Arabian Business.His announcement comes amid a spate of negative publicity about 
The World, a man-made archipelago of around 300 islands off the coast of Dubai. Fears about the global 
recession together with the lack of construction progress on islands have led to some media reports claiming the 
project has been cancelled. Qurashi denied this but he said some developers were delaying construction and 
altering development plans in light of the global crisis. "It would be unrealistic to say all the islands would start 
construction at the same time," he said. "There's no denying it, that a lot of the island owners have suffered and 
maybe they have had to change their plans and some of them may not have the finances available to start 
immediately: He said he knew of around half a dozen island owners who are in the advanced stages of 
construction plans. "The world islands are complicated and although it looks deserted, in the background there is 
a lot of work going on. I know of 10 or 12 islands that will start construction next year - we've seen a lot of the 
plans and construction companies being appointed,' he said. Asked how island investors' development plans 
have changed Qurashi said: "I don't think any of us believed it would be [about] AED5Om villas, ft's not that kind 
of developmenelts a development where timeshare and structural ownership will boom. Holiday resorts will 
boom. It will be a major tourist destination."
