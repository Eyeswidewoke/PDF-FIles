story. 
Republicans Subpoenaed 15 Years of Hunter Biden Phone Records, Democrats Reveal 
The Hill (03/12, Beitsch) reported that House Republicans have subpoenaed AT&T for 15 years of Hunter Biden's 
phone records, Democrats revealed on Tuesday, the latest sign that GOP lawmakers are plowing ahead with their 
impeachment inquiry into President Biden despite his son testifying that his father was not involved in his business 
ventures. The article added that the subpoena — issued last week but first disclosed in a Democratic memo — asks 
AT&T to provide information "regarding the account information, communication records, and payment history of 
all AT&T accounts affiliated with Robert Hunter Biden," as part of the GOP impeachment inquiry into the president. 
The article mentioned that House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) said the records are "probative" 
of whether Joe Biden communicated with Hunter Biden's business associates if Hunter Biden was communicating 
with his father during important parts of his business dealings, and if the president's son was speaking with other 
Executive Branch officials. The article noted that the move by Comer comes after the FBI arrested a former 
informant on charges related to lying to the agency about the president accepting a bribe — undercutting a key 
element of the GOP's probe. But the memo from House Democrats criticizes Republicans for failing to disclose the 
recent subpoena as it has with other demands of the president's family. The Huffington Post (03/12, Delaney), and 
the Daily Mail (03/12, Phillips) also reported on the story. 
Ex-Mar-a-Lago Employee Says He Unwittingly Helped Load Trump Classified Papers Onto Plane 
The Independent (03/12, Baio) reported that Brian Butler, a former Mar-a-Lago employee who has publicly 
identified himself as a witness in the classified documents case against Donald Trump, recounted how he 
unknowingly helped load boxes of those documents onto the former president's plane on CNN's The Source with 
Kaitlin Collins. The article added that Butler, a valet and manager at Mar-a-Lago, said that in June 2022 he and Walt 
Nauta, another former employee who is also a co-defendant in the case, loaded approximately 10 to 15 white 
banker's boxes from a car to Trump's plane. The article stated that Butler said he had "no clue" the boxes contained 
potential national security secrets at the time. He recalled that he often helped load the Trump family's luggage or 
the former president's things from cars to the plane. It wasn't until later that Butler realized those boxes, the same 
ones that appeared in the government's indictment, contained classified information. The article noted that Butler, 
who revealed himself to be "Trump Employee 5" in the government's case against the former president, said he is 
coming forward with his story and identity now to get ahead of speculation before the trial begins. MSNBC (03/12, 
Benen) also reported on the story. 
Analysis: There's New Reason to Think Trump Still Has Classified Documents 
An analysis piece by the Washington Post (03/12, Bump) stated that the central reason that Donald Trump was 
indicted for retaining documents marked as classified but President Biden was not is that Trump tried to retain the 
documents once the government sought their return. This is not a matter of opinion; it is, instead, the distinction 
drawn by special counsel Robert K. Hur when he declined to seek charges against Biden. Trump was known to have 
documents and tried to keep them. Hence the indictment. The author noted that on Monday afternoon, 
CNN published an interview with a former Mar-a-Lago employee that bolsters one of the lingering possibilities 
surrounding Trump's action; that he may still have documents at one of his other properties. The author 
mentioned that the FBI's 2022 search for documents was limited to Trump's Palm Beach estate. The FBI gathered 
scores of documents from a storage room near the pool and from Trump's personal office. 
New Mexico Launches Real-Time Data Portal for Missing and Murdered Indigenous People 
KRQE (CBS-13) (03/12, Segarra) reported that New Mexico's attorney general has launched a site for real-time data 
on missing Indigenous people. The idea is to help boost communication around the issue. The article added that 
the portal currently lists 201 missing Indigenous people in New Mexico. The average time missing is 2,886 days, the 
data reveals. Most of the current missing individuals are middle-aged, although the data shows 31 missing 
Indigenous individuals below the age of 20. On the portal, individuals can find info on filing new reports for missing 
individuals. The portal is just one part of the larger effort to reduce the number of missing and murdered 
Indigenous people. The federal government recently released info in its efforts to address the problem as well. The 
article quoted FBI Special Agent in Charge Raul Bujanda, who said, "We fully support our partners at the New 
Mexico Department of Justice (NMDOJ) as they roll out this important initiative, although our state, and the Navajo 
Nation, has access to the most accurate data on missing persons in the country, their work will offer families 
transparency while providing additional state focused tools to ensure proper reporting for their loved ones. Along
