Equity-market perspectives 
Healthier portfolio returns 
In times of fast changing market sentiment, crisis summits and 
unconventional central bank policies, one can easily lose track 
of long-term trends. But they are the drivers of the healthcare 
sector. Demand for drugs, care and hospital capacity is naturally 
rising in an ageing society. Many elderly people must take 
several drugs a day against chronic diseases. 
Even in emerging countries, the healthcare sector is growing 
at an above-average rate. Increasing prosperity enables more 
and more people in Asia, Africa and Latin America to afford 
modem medicine and procedures. Along with Western lifestyles, 
associated lifestyle diseases such as diabetes are spreading 
rapidly, creating a growing need for medical treatment 
The development of new drugs consumes enormous research 
funds: The pharmaceuticals industry estimates the costs of a 
new therapy at roughly $1.5 billion. But it can be worthwhile. 
For example. patients who face the unwelcome prospect of 
hepatitis C destroying their liver can be completely healed within 
twelve weeks. Artificial heart valves can be inserted via a minor 
inguinal incision. New product of immuno-oncology could help 
to improve the longevity prospects of cancer patients, turning 
cancer from a lethal into a chronic disease. 
Not only patients but also shareholders have benefited from the 
healthcare sector in the last few years. While the total market for 
healthcare products has doubled within five years, the market 
value of tlx: sector has almost tripled.' 
As well as the favorable long-term earnings outlook, the 
structural risk profile of the healthcare sector appears to be 
comparatively beneficial, as well. Contrary to the demand for 
commodities or automobiles, the need for drugs is largely

immune to cyclical ups and downs. To put it in bold and simple 
terms- "Economic crises will not keep people from falling ill." 
Attractive returns have therefore been achieved at comparatively 
low risk. The chart illustrates the relative strength of the 
healthcare sector. Our analysis of demographic trends and 
the research pipelines suggests that the healthcare sector will 
continue to lead with a view to the risk/return ratio. For this 
reason, health could be long-term healthy for every equity 
portfolio. In the short term, due to high valuations, we would 
wart for better entry points.

In a sector comparison, the healthcare sector has shown the 
best risk/return ratio in the last five years: Above-average 
returns at below-average price fluctuations.
