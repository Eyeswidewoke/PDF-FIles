All of which makes it rather odd that so many hopes should still rest on central 
banks. After all, Japan already tried OE from March 2001 to March 2006. According 
to most empirical studies, this was of limited help in either boosting output or 
inflation. Indeed, it may even have strengthened the performance of Japan's 
weakest banks -further delaying the necessary clean••up of bank balance sheets. 
Markets were fairly unimpressed. Japan's initial dose of QE simply seems to have 
acted as a sedative. One down-side of loose monetary policy and not just in Japan 
- is that it can reduce the pressure for reforms. 
2. The limits of central banking. 
So far, we have seen that there is little monetary policy can do to boost long-term 
growth potential. At most, it might provide breathing space for structural reforms 
(but with the caveat noted above). For investors, however, a more immediate 
question is whether central banks are also losing their ability to cheer up markets. 
Here, the evidence is mixed—and to see why, look no further than at Japan's 
previous attempt at QE. 
Japan's structural problems are real enough, but they only tell half of the story. The 
other halt is one of monetary impotence to do even the limited work central banks 
are usually charged with: making sure that actual economic growth is in line with 
potential growth rates. Central banking can prove tricky enough in normal times. As 
Rudiger Dornbusch quipped in 1997, "None of the U.S. expansions of the past 40 
years died in bed of old age; every-one was murdered by the Federal Reserve."' But 
at least, central banks have plenty of historic data to rely on. 
By contrast, economists looking at Japan since the early 1990s had to go back to 
the Great Depression to find anything remotely similar. Japan appeared stuck in a 
liquidity trap, the traditional bogeyman of central banking (see box). Much of the 
policy response in the rest of the world since 2009 can best be understood as an 
attempt to avoid such a fate. 
Central bank balance sheets as

Throughout the developed world, °antral 
banks have taken ova more assets onto 
their balance sheets. Initially, this reflected 
such programs aS the Fed's %WI Asset-
Backed Securities Loan FarAtity(TALF) in the 
United States. intended to boost consumer 
lending in the aftermath of the financial crisis. 
Similarly, the Eurozone debt crisis caused the 
ECU's balance sheet to expand, well before 
the formal adaption of OE. In recent years, 
balance sheet growth has been strongest in 
Japan, reflecting its increasingly aggressive 
use of of policies.
