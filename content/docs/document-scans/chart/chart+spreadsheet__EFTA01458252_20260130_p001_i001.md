Equity-market perspectives 
Who's afraid of Janet Yellen's first move? 
No subject has been discussed more widely within the financial 
markets during the past twelve months than a possible rate hike 
by the Fed. The Fed and its expansionary monetary policy have 
strongly supported the equity-market boom which started in 
2009. Would a shift in the policy stance by Fed chair Janet Yellen, 
by contrast, not automatically weigh on equities? 
History shows that the S&P 500 Index has initially reacted with 
Increased volatility in the months around a shift in monetary 
policy but reported price gains in the months that follow. So no 
reason to worry? 
A more differentiated view with a clear distinction between 
the drivers of price gains - earnings growth and equity-market 
valuation-seems appropriate. In the past, corporate-earnings 
growth rates have often exceeded 15% in the year following the 
first rate hike since many industrial sectors had just emerged 
from recession. But the second driver —valuation has often 
partially offset this. Valuation measures such as the price-to-
earnings IP/E1 ratio have usually fallen during this period, due 
to market participants' concerns that the central bank might 
impede economic activity with its anti-inflationary rate hikes. 
Despite this countervailing trend, equity investors have, in 
sum, tended to record price gains in the six to twelve months 
following the first Fed hike due to strong earnings growth. 
Will history repeat itself? 2015 is somewhat different since the 
U.S recovery is no longer inns initial phase. Equity investors 
should therefore instead be prepared for one-digit yearly growth 
rates in the S&P 500 Index for the rest of this economic cycle. 
Most of the valuation measures have already exceeded their 
historic average values. A slight decline of P/E ratios therefore 
seems plausible for the years to come. 
Due to diverging central-bank policies, equities outside the 
United States should he less negatively affected during this 
cycle than in the past. Even if the Fed starts tightening this year, 
the central banks of Europe, Japan and China will continue to 
expand Itquidrty. Equities remain an attractive investment choice 
in this environment. 
All in all, we are not afraid of Ms. Yellen's decision. Price 
adjustments may rather be seen as buying opportunities.

In over 70% of all incidents, the U.S. equity market advanced 
by an average of 6% in the 6-12 months after the first Fed hike.
