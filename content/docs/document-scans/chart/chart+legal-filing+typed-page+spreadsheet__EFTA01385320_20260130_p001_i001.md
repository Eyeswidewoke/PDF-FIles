HY Energy index at more realistic levels as 2016 OPEC deal exuberance fades 
In our 2017 Outlook report, we took a cautious stance on the sector 
considering the HY Energy index was trading only -30 bps wide of the overall 
HY Index, comparable to the relative spread seen during 1H-14 ($100 oil). As it 
turns out, exactly a year later, the spread has widened to -50 bps. though on 
fundamentals the E&P sector is on much more solid footing vs. a year ago. For 
one, the modest bullish oil case is playing out as expected - maybe even 
slightly better (2018 WTI strip is $56.19 currently vs. $54.46 a year back). The 
oil market has dodged the major downside and we now stand one year closer 
to a potential market rebalancing. 
Second, companies continue to make 
progress on the operational front with lower cost and increased productivity 
(discussed later). 
The parity versus the HY Index persisted through 01 17 (average spread of -22 
bps), actually trading flat at one point. The market started turning more 
cautious around May as the 2018 WTI strip fell well below $50 ($47.57 the first 
week of May). The next correction, in June, was even sharper with the 2018 
oil strip getting close to $45, resulting in the HY Energy-HY Index spread 
touching the 2017 high of 140 bps (June 21st). With the reminder that 
downside risks to the oil markets had not gone away, sector valuation has 
turned more level-headed - even as oil has stayed above $55 (2018 strip), the 
HY Energy Index continues to be fairly wide of the early-year tights. In fact, 
current levels are actually comparable to early June, when WTI 2018 strip was 
more than $5/bbl lower than it is today.
