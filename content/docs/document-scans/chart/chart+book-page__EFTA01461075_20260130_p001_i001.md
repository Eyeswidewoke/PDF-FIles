Special Report: Euroglut here to stay: trillions of outflows to go 
3% of GDP in the long-term, but as a cumulative stock measure, the NIIP is slow 
to reflect structural breaks in an economy's flow of funds. 
The Eurozone's incomplete transition is palpable when plotting average 610 
current accounts against the latest NIIPs for O3 2014 (Figure 7). All countries 
except the euro-area are in balance, with their structural surpluses (deficits) 
reflected in positive (negative) NIIPs. The EMU cuts a lonely figure in the bottom-
right quadrants We also include South Korea, which scraped into the first quadrant 
only last autumn following a twenty-year adjustment process. Korea is further 
advanced than Europe on a similar path towards economic Japanization, and we 
therefore study its case in more detail below. 
The external accounts of individual member states vary significantly.' Germany and 
the Netherlands are long-standing creditor nations. Germany's NIIP remained 
positive even as it borrowed heavily during the 1990s to finance reunification. Yet 
while Germany and the Netherlands account for much of Europe's surpluses, 
others are behind the structural shift: the GIIPS. Those states whose governments 
were on the verge of default in 2012 had also accumulated vast external debt 
ratios. Post-2012 austerity extends to their external accounts, but despite painfully 
sustained current account surpluses, it will take a generation for Greece and Spain 
in particular to align their NIIPs with their newly found prudence. 
Transition to mature creditor economy requires massive outflows or depredation 
While it is evident that the euro area's external account is still in transition, it is 
difficult to determine the precise level at which the NIIP will settle. Modeling 
stationary conditions for NIIPs is one of the most central and contentious 
exercises in modern macroeconomics. We use a few simple frameworks to 
estimate the Eurozone's 'equilibrium NIIP'. Although these estimates vary, they all 
yield the fundamental conclusion that the structural adjustment is far from over. 
Theoretical debt sustainability models essentially ask what current account level is 
consistent with a country's steady-state growth rates and stationary external debt 
levels. We flip these models around: given current account surpluses are here to 
stay, as argued above, what is the implied stationary NIIP level? In a simple stock-
flow model, akin to Domars classic public debt model, the stationary condition for
