Railroads 
Canadian Rails 
Executive Summary 
We are expanding our coverage of Transportation companies with initiation of 
coverage of the Canadian railroad industry. We are positive on Canadian Pacific 
(CP. Buy) and cautious on Canadian National (CNI, Sell), as we see overall market 
share and earnings trajectory driving a reversal in recent relative value trends. All 
told we forecast CP to grow EPS at double the rate of CNI (+30% for CP vs. + 15% 
for CNI cumulatively through 2019), which together with capex and free cash 
trends should drive re-rating at CP and de-rating for CNI. In this report we present 
a primer on the Canadian rail industry, with deep dives on Canadian Pacific and 
Canadian National. 
We do not believe current valuation appropriately reflects the relative earnings 
trajectory and shifting market dynamics within the Canadian rail industry. We 
believe CP is well positioned to regain market share from CNI as it leverages 
its lowered cost base, improved service levels, and recent capacity investments 
to retake market share. In our view, these efforts will help CP achieve industry-
leading volume and earnings growth over the next several years (ex-CSX). 
A lower cost base and better service levels should help CP regain share 
From 2012-2016, CM increased volumes (revenue ton-miles [RTM's)) at more than 
double the rate of CP (+3.0% CAGR vs. +1.2% CAGR for CP). While mix likely 
played a factor, we believe the key driver behind this was CNI's ability to win 
market share as the lower-cost carrier with superior service. Further, this came 
at a transitional time for CP as the focus was largely on the implementation of 
Precision Railroading which likely pushed freight onto other transportation modes 
as well. As you can see below, CNI had nearly 18% points of cost advantage over 
CP (as measured by operating ratio) before CP began implementing Precision 
Railroading in 2012. This advantage has largely been erased, and we expect just 
a 200bps difference in operating ratios in 2017.

Moreover, CP has seen a significant improvement in service levels while CNI's 
service metrics are essentially inline with 2012 levels. Behind this improvement 
was CP's multi-year track upgrade program which was completed in 2015.
