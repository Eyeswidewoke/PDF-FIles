UK: Markets still see rate-cut risk 
• 
The BoE revised down its forecasts for near-term inflation, though they 
remain slightly above 2% at the end of the forecast horizon. Despite this, 
and generally positive comments on the real economy from Governor 
Carney, markets continue to see the risk of a rate cut later this year. 
Near-term revisions, similar end-horizon forecasts 
The Bank of England this week published revised forecasts in its quarterly 
Intletkn Report. Not only were the Bank's end-period projections little changed 
for both growth and inflation relative to the November forecast round, but it is 
fair to say that the Governor sounded a note of economic optimism in his 
remarks at the press conference, despite the recent escalation of global 
economic and financial market concerns. Still, near-term forecasts for growth 
and inflation were revised down by up to 40bps each.

First, consider Figure 1 which shows the evolution of the Bank's forecasts for 
1Y, 2Y and 3Y-ahead CPI inflation. Near-term forecasts for inflation in 
particular were revised lower, as Figure 2 shows, thanks in no small part to 
further falls in oil prices. But at the 2Y end 3Y horizons Inflation was seen as 
being broadly simi€ar to what was expected in November (in fact the 3Y 
forecast was modestly higher) and - importantly - remained above the 2% 
target. Moreover, it was pointed out that core inflation had risen, which 
illustrated the point that much of the fall in inflation had been down to volatile 
external factors. 
Growth was revised down (Figure 3) to a similar degree to inflation in the near-
term (i.e. up to 40bps) as a result of recent global economic and financial 
market developments. The Governor remained relatively optimistic about UK 
economic growth describing the outlook as a "continued solid expansion". A 
weaker external picture, with net exports expected to drag on growth, would 
be partially offset according to the Bank by lower sterling (down 6% trade-
weighted relative to its peak in mid-November), a lowering of the yield curve
