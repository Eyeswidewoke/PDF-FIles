A Buyer s Market 
he residential property market in Michigan presents a rare 
investment opportunity: high yields combined with excellent 
prospects for capital growth. Each of our properties in Michigan 
offers a minimum 12% guaranteed net rental income for two years and 
exposure to a housing market that is starting to rise from post-crisis lows. 
We prioritise high income over longer-term capital growth because the 
former is within our control, while macro-economic trends have been 
especially hard to predict in recent years. 
Location is key: we only operate in prosperous, economically viable neighbourhoods. 
After targeting an area we then search on a street-by-street basis, before selecting 
the outstanding individual properties. This ensures our homes are desirable 
to potential tenants, as well as representing great value for investors. 
We make sure our districts are in relative proximity to the city of Detroit, 
benefiting from the city's job market and infrastructure links, without being 
economically dependent on the city's fortunes. 
The Auto industry is a major employer in the area, with Ford, GM and Chrysler 
headquartered in Greater Detroit. All three recently reported strong results, 
gaining combined market share for the first time in 20 years. Federal and private 
investment in Detroit has also helped re-generate the Downtown area, attracting 
a number of smaller businesses. The Technology and Medical sectors are 
growing particularly quickly, as the city continues to diversify its economy. 
From a cultural point of view, Michigan has abundant resources: 
well-established universities, sports teams and museums. The University 
of Michigan at Ann Arbor ranks in the top 20 of universities worldwide, 
attracting young, educated people to live and work in the local area.

The Metro 
Detroit Area 
etroit city is only one component of 
Metro Detroit (3,888 square miles), 
which is comprised of six counties-
Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Oakland, St. Clair 
and Wayne. Time was when the fortunes of Metro 
Detroit were tied to those of the city. This is no 
longer true; many of the satellite municipalities 
have established independent economies 
and now represent a greater proportion of 
the Metro area's wealth than Detroit city. 
This is expressed statistically in the graph below 
• METRO DETROIT 
• WAYNE COUNTY

DETROIT on 
While the population of Detroit city has declined, 
this rate of decline does not correlate with that 
of Greater Detroit as a whole. In fact, if we omit 
the population decline from Detroit city from the 
results then Metro Detroit's population would have 
actually increased by 24% over the given period. 
This increase is a combination of people moving 
from Detroit city to suburban districts and a 
significant number of people moving from 
other parts of the country, attracted to job 
opportunities in Metro Detroit's emergent 
communities. The census figures show that adults 
between 18 and 64 account for a healthy 63% 
of the Oakland, Macomb and Wayne population 
(the suburban areas of Metro Detroit).
