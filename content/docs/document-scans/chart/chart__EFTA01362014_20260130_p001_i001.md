level still the same, absent Fed and FX reserve expansion, equity prices look 
more likely to decelerate and quite sharply. The tie out, presumably with the 
"leading" indicator of other central bank action is that other central banks have 
been instrumental in supporting equities in the past. The largest of course 
being the ECB and BoJ. If the Fed isn't going doing its job, it is good to know 
someone is willing to do the job for them, albeit there is a "lag" before they 
appreciate the extent of someone else's policy "failure". And just to ram home 
the point - this differential relationship is entirely consistent with the idea that 
FX reserves are accumulate don the back of Fed balance sheet expansion and 
so if the Fed's balance sheet is not expanding then it is a double whammy that 
FX reserves are also not expanding and as we shall see below are contracting!

So now let's be a little more specific on the Fed balance sheet and FX reserves 
now. The next chart shows both are decelerating sharply. The Fed's balance 
sheet is almost flat on the year and reserves are down around 5 percent and 
counting. The two as we have demonstrated are clearly connected. In the 
reverse scenario (as opposed to the above, when we demonstrated the 
connection when the Fed was expanding its balance sheet), tighter Fed policy 
forces other central banks to spend reserves to defend their currency peg and 
in principle shrink their balance sheets. This is the example recently with the 
adjustment in China's FX regime to accommodate more market based fixings. 
The ensuing unwind of the China carry trade has solicited what appears to 
have been significant FX intervention, judging by the move in front end swap 
spreads and dealer inventory of shorter dated Treasuries. The main point 
however is that it is not a change in FX regime per se that drives the loss of 
liquidity but that that change emanates from a tighter Fed balance sheet. 
Hence in the event that the Fed raises rates and we start to worry about 
balance sheet unwind this becomes a much more significant issue going 
forward. The Fed's balance sheet for example could easily be negative 5 
percent this time next year, depending on how they manage the SOMA 
portfolio and would be associated with further FX reserve loss unless countries, 
including China allowed for a much weaker currency. This would be a great 
concern for global (central bank liquidity) 
So one counter is that FX reserve loss can be offset by other central banks' 
liquidity injection. At one level this is tempting but flawed; at another level it 
is more plausible. The first level is that FX reserve loss typically is "sterilized".
