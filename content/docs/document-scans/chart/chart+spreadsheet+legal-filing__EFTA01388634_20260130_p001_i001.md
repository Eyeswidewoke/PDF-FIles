— Class A Bilk Warehouse: Prices for large stabilized Class A bulk warehouse properties have increased 
markedly in recent years. in some cases surpassing replacement cost. These assets, leased long-term to 
credit tenants, can provide stable cash flow, but are generally underwritten to lower total returns. Target Class 
A assets in core submarkets where in-place rents are below current market levels. 
— Leasing-up I Development: In the context of healthy fundamentals, build-to-core should provide solid returns 
and a way to access scarce modern assets. Supply risks are rising in Dallas and Atlanta, but conditions are 
more favorable in New York/New Jersey, South Florida, Southern California, San Francisco Bay Area, Denver, 
Austin, Seattle and Portland. 
— National Distribution Hubs: The major national distribution hubs, many of which have strong finks to 
international trade (e.g., Atlanta, Riverside. Los Angeles. Chicago, New York, and Northern New Jersey) 
remain investment targets. While pricing is competitive and these markets are receiving a disproportionate 
share of new supply, they are expected to continue to post strong demand growth. 
— Underperforming Markets: The current development pipeline in Dallas could outpace demand, causing 
vacancy to rise and rent growth to taper amid leasing competition. Additionally. we would generally avoid 
markets where local demand drivers are impaired and vacancy rates are high, specifically in Baltimore and 
Washington D.C. Notably, Houston has experienced availability rate increases in the past few quarters and 
fundamentals are expected to weaken further in the near term, 
— Non-Warehouse: We maintain an underweight to high-finish industrial property, including light industriat/tlex, 
office/service, manufacturing and smaller business parks. Although conditions stand to improve in this growth 
cycle, over the longer term. they are tied to weaker segments of the economy and tend to be more expensive 
to lease and maintain than warehouses. We are highly selective in targeting research & development 
(R&D)/Office in only a few high-barrier markets that have good growth dynamics and/or tech drivers, such as 
San Jose. Oakland, Seattle, Orange County and Miami.
