The table below highlights these three periods in terms of the actual notional 
impact on global liquidity via the combined effects of revaluing the PBOC balance 
sheet as well as the changes in the underlying domestic liquidity. Under a relatively 
stable currency the PBOC expanded its balance sheet aggressively in the first 
phase, presumably in part being obliged to accelerated FX reserve accumulation; 
the Fed was more or less in between expanding their balance sheet. The second 
phase saw the more dramatic currency appreciation with a strong Fed expansion 
but also strong PBOC liquidity expansion. The third phase saw even stronger Fed 
balance sheet expansion but weaker PBOC expansion and more modest RMB 
appreciation. The last two phases combined saw global central bank liquidity 
expand by notionally similar amounts i.e. $1500 billion. More than double the first 
phase when the currency was more stable and the Fed was quieter. However note 
that as expected, the reserve accumulation was almost the same in each period, 
around 500-600+ billion. So even though the Fed wasn't expanding the balance 
sheet much, the hangover of the previous expansion and capital flows in general 
required a more aggressive intervention by PBOC to acquire reserves and maintain 
the a stable currency. So a notionally less aggressive expansion in global central 
bank liquidity under a stable exchange rate regime was disproportionately more 
skewed to reserve accumulation.

The next issue is given changes to liquidity how does it impact asset prices. 
We can think of the three components of liquidity: the Fed's balance sheet, the 
accumulation of FX reserves by other central banks; and the residual of other 
central banks' liquidity expansion after the accumulation of FX reserves. As the 
chart below shows in terms of growth the explosion of the Fed stands out 
during the crisis but there have been strong expansions in other central banks' 
liquidity excluding reserve increases. FX reserve accumulation has been quite 
weak since 2012 and is now negative. In absolute terms liquidity is strongest in 
FX reserves and other central banks ex reserves by a factor of three times for 
the Fed's balance sheet.
