FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
CAD Flow Picture Very Nega 
We are more bearish CAD. Speculative shorts are 
building, but on the portfolio flow side, the balance of 
payments is characterized by a large overhang of fixed 
income inflow positions as a by-product of Fed OE 
(chart 4). Canada benefitted from close to 280bn of 
"excess" inflows over the 2010-2013, which have 
plugged a sharply wider current account deficit similar 
in size to the UK. The UK, in contrast, has suffered from 
a lack of inflows in recent years (chart 4). While FDI 
and underweight fixed income positions have the 
potential to "plug" the UK deficit, the risks appear 
skewed the other way in Canada. 
On the monetary policy side, Canada doesn't appear 
well placed to benefit from an improving US cycle 
either. Rate expectations are already running ahead of 
the Fed and BoE by a quarter, and given the BoC's 
renewed dovishness there is limited potential of these 
happening sooner. Indeed, the correlation between US 
and Canadian data surprises has dropped off sharply 
over the last few years, pointing to the divergent trends 
in local housing markets and domestic leverage. To 
boot, Canadian terms of trade have clearly peaked 
(chart 6), with the currency moderately expensive 
versus non-energy commodity prices and supply glut in 
North America oil production providing an additional 
headwind. 
Big picture, GBP/CAD is a dollar-neutral cross, with 
correlations with other USD crosses all lying below 50% 
over 1-3 year time horizons and zero correlation with the 
broad USD TWI since 1995. The relative performance 
between UK financials and Canadian stocks does a decent 
job of explaining big picture turns since the early 1990s. 
The cross remains more than 20% below its pre-crisis 
average suggesting plenty of potential for upside as the 
respective domestic stories play out.
