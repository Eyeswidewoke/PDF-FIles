Special Report: Argentina - Position tor the upturn 
the Egyptian pound, for instance - the peso is already 
overvalued according to our estimation (chart below). 
Therefore, while in Egypt monetary authorities can 
afford to keep the pound stable for months, Argentina's 
central bank needs to strike a balance between 
anchoring 
inflation 
expectations 
and 
preventing 
excessive overvaluation.

Implied yields also seem too low The chart below 
shows that the 7M point for example offers almost 
340bp of pick up from a hold to maturity perspective. 
This wide spread suggest that tactical hedges for the 
peso's 
"step-function" 
behavior 
are 
relatively 
inexpensive - a result that extends to floaters.

Implied yields: Relatively low bar for tactical hedges 
This tug-of-war has resulted in USD.A.RS following a 
"step-function" ascent 
— with jumps followed by 
stability - thus boding for tactically managing longs 
(carry based strategies) 
The choice of instrument in the short-end is also 
important given wide dispersion in valuations. LEBACs 
are the cleanest instruments to express monetary 
policy views, but they are also short and the least 
accessible. Fixed-rate BOTEs and floating BOCANs and 
BOPOMs are accessible, but bear in mind that they also 
differ in liquidity and fixings so that comparing these 
instruments has obvious limitations. 
From a macro standpoint, LEBACs price a small 
likelihood of further tightening and low supply risk —
thus favoring floaters, as we discuss in more details 
shoilly. The chart bellows shows that the term-
structure is flat, while we see room for further 
tightening. Also, the LEBACs have been used not only 
as a conduit to implement monetary policy but also for 
sterilization purposes. Widening CAD and slow 
reduction in nominal deficits bode for pent-up supply of 
LEBACs and thus upside risk for these short-end fixed 
instruments.

Fixed or floating rates? A look into valuations 
We prefer floaters to fixed rate instruments on our 
macro view and valuation, although the latter is 
clouded by market segmentation. We use LEBACs as a 
building ground for valuation despite its limitations 
because: 1) They are the main instrument to manage 
local liquidity; 2) They ultimately affect the private 
floating rate used to fix the BOCANs; and 3) The repo 
rate used to fix the BOPOM 20s moves in line with the 
35-day LEBAC yield 
Since the LEBAC curve extends to only 9 months we 
also build on BOTEs in pricing two scenarios for short-
