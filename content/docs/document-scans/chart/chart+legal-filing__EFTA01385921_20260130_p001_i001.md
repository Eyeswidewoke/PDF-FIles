There are three themes that form this outlook and various risk factors that 
could force a reappraisal and need to be closely monitored. Two, the terminal 
Funds rate and term premium, relate directly to longer term rates, where we 
use the 5y5y as a proxy. One, the Fed, relates to the evolution of the front end 
in terms of the timing and speed of normalization. 
Terminal funds can be viewed as the sustainable terminal rate for the Fed in 
the sense that it is an equilibrium i.e. the Fed does not have to keep raising 
rates or reverse course. 5y5y has been a good proxy for the terminal rate in 
that it pretty much sits on top of Funds at the end of each cycle -- therefore 
represents an upper ceiling i.e. the fed would not have had to reverse course if 
funds never reached 5y5y ex ante. In the Fed's ACM term premium model 
5y5y has averaged in 2015 2.59 percent. This is a little higher than the Treasury 
5y5y and about 30 bps higher than the market pricing for 5y5y OIS, currently 
around 2.3 percent. Whichever way we look at it the market is clearly pricing 
for a terminal Funds rate somewhere around 2 1/2 percent if not a little below. 
For this rate to be higher we think there would need to be a sustained shock 
higher in sustainable growth expectations. 
With 2014 GDP now in, what is once again so impressive is that GDP has not 
failed to disappoint. Nominal growth finished the year a paltry 3.66 percent 
and the year averaged 3.88 percent. This is bang in line with the average of the 
last 5 years since 2009, of 3.85 percent. You could be forgiven for thinking that 
we actually were witnessing an accelerated economic recovery in reading the 
economic consensus. The fact is that this is nonsense. The economic growth 
has been incredibly stable at a sub 4 percent nominal pace for five years. No 
acceleration. Just the same. Will 2015 be any different. Best guess, "no". Note 
that this is why there is no productivity growth to speak of as the labor market 
recovery that has been impressive has cannibalized productivity. This raises 
core issues as to the sustainability of labor market strength, profitability and 
the ability of the economy to withstand any kind of accommodation removal. It 
also begs the question why have corporates relied so much on labor input to 
deliver the GDP rather than eking out productivity gains. Is it a 
technology/innovation constraint, an investment issue or simply using "cheap" 
labor while it is available. However while these issues are to be resolved, fair to 
say it is hard to argue that the fair value terminal rate needs to be very different 
from 2 1/2 percent. Note that profits are now lower for 2014 than 2013. the first 
decline, since 2008.
