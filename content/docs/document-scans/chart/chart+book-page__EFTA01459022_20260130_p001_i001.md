Equity-market perspectives 
Equity-market outlook for 2016: tactical, selective and constructive 
Global equity markets have recovered since mid-September. and 
most stock-market indicators are approaching the levels we had 
forecast :twelve months ago. What will 2016 bring? 
Seven years after the start of the Groat Financial Crisis, markets 
have entered a mature phase. For this reason, 2016 and beyond 
should only yield mid-single-digit total returns. At the same time, 
we have to acknowledge a higher risk that annual returns could 
easily turn negative. 
With a view to stock valuations, we do not see much further 
upwards potential for price-to-earnings {P/E) ratios. Our 
constructive view on equities is therefore based on expected 
moderate earnings growth and dividends. Earnings growth 
should be driven by successful firms in the technology, 
healthcare, finance and consumption sectors. Dividends, in 
turn. are gaining in significance: globally speaking, distributions 
should reach a record level in 2016. In an environment of very 
low or negative interest rates, an expected median dividend 
of 2.5%' is significant. The share of dividends in equities' total 
returns should increase in the years to come, since the potential 
for share-price gains has decreased compared with previous 
years. 
Our preference for equities from developed markets remains 
unchanged. In 2016, many emerging markets might face further 
headwinds from low commodity prices and decelerating growth 
in China. But we do not have any distinct preferences within 
the United States, Europe and Japan. Earnings growth should 
be similar in all three regions in 2016 and less influenced by 
currency fluctuations than in 2015. 
In 2016, our focus will, therefore, be more on the selection 
of sectors and stocks and less on regional allocations. Equity 
investors will find the winners of further developments in

digitalization, particularly in the technology sector. Cloud 
computing or big data are no longer just catchwords - they have 
turned into multi-billion U.S. dollar sales drivers. The most recent 
price corrections in pharmaceuticals offer selective entry points 
in order to participate in seminal progress in cancer research.
Financials, meanwhile, should benefit from the expected rate 
move of the Fed. 
Tact€cal and selective equity investment could turn 2016 into 
another successful year.
