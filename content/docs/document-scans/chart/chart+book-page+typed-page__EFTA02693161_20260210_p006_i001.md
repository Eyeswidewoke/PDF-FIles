vector magnitude of its regression weights at that time lag. We ranked 
the sensors and reran the decoding procedure with the most 
important sensor, the four most important sensors. the seven most 
important sensors. etc. until all sensors were used. These sensor 
sensitivity curves of mean CC vs. the number of sensors fit a double-
exponential function well (R2 =0.95-1.00) (Fit:. •1). For all phases of 
the task the curves peaked then plateaued, or nearly plateaued, near 
15 sensors. 
A macroscale sensorimotor network encoded hand velocity 
To graphically assess the relative contributions of scalp regions to 
the reconstruction of hand velocity• we projected the across-subject 
means of the vector magnitudes of the sensor weights onto a time 
series (-200 to 0 ms in increments of 10 ms) of scalp maps for each 
phase of the adaptation task The scalp maps for each phase of the task 
resembled each other. so only those for pre-exposure are shown 
(Fig. SA). A network of sensors over central and posterior scalp areas 
contributed to decoding hand velocity with a salient member of the 
network over the contralateral motor area. Although the scalp maps of 
the different phases appeared similar upon visual inspection, we 
investigated the presence of statistically significant increases and 
decreases in early-, late-. and post-exposure relative to baseline (pre-
exposure). We observed notable focal differences between phases of 
the task in scalp areas over mediolateral premotor and posterior 
parietal cortices in particular (Fig. 58). To better estimate the cortical
