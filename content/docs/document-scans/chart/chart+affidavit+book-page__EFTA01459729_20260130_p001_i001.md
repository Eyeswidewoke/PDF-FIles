Focus Europe: Dark clouds, no storm yet 
SIREN based on reference quarters 
SIREN by refinance quarter captures the macro momentum (Fig. 6) and 
surprises (Fig. 7) across quarters by summing news based on reference dates. 
With the advanced estimate of Q4-15 GDP scheduled for next week. 
SIREN-Momentum continues to point to high 0.4% qoq for euro O4 GDP.
Surveys point to 0.5% while hard data are less optimistic. Our forecast for 
O4 GDP growth is relatively more modest at 0.35% qoq. Hard data appear 
to justify our caution. 
While SIREN-Surprise for O4 continues to be more positive than in the 
previous two quarters. 01 data have disappointed significantly. The current 
quarter's initial movement has been the worst start since O2 2013.
