US Faced Income Weekly 
Term premium itself could also adjust even if the terminal funds rate outlook 
doesn't. In many ways this is probably a bigger risk especially if we link the 
term premium decline to foreign demand for US rates. We showed the other 
week the correlation between the decline in the term premium and 
"overinvestment" by foreign central banks into Treasuries. Note that the term 
premium enjoyed an accelerated decline in late 2014 but has since been more 
stable, in line with the collapse in euro yields. Clearly any shift in the Euro 
outlook could lead to a reversal in the drop in term premium in the US. 
However in this regard the Fed's own shift in their dot plot should be taken 
into consideration. The dots have both become less diverse and importantly 
the lower long term dot outlook - which we think has more to go - serves by 
definition to reduce market uncertainty around the Fed's normalization process. 
As such it is not at all clear that term premium should rebound 100 - 150 bps 
or so i.e. to mid 2014 levels or at least might be confined to a more moderate 
rise. This is especially likely once normalization begins in that in all the 
tightening cycles since the late 1980s term premium falls when the Fed 
tightens.
