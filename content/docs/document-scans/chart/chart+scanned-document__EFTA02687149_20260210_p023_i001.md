supermarkets. 
insurers, private 
and retail banks 
pensions firms 
Selection 
e.g. pensions 
funds. HNW, 
SWFs, local 
authorities, 
endowments,

Pain 
• Increased competition. Impact of open 
architecture (e.g. fund supermarkets) and 
new regulation (e.g. UCITS III, Retail 
Distribution Review) standardising 
traditional products 
• Liability to investors on product assurances 
and for mis-selling, e.g. product and fund 
style drift, especially on third party funds 
and products 
• Detailed disclosure and process 
requirements from regulation, e.g. new risk 
management processes, model approval, 
data quality 
• Low operating margins. Need to identify and 
reduce costs and liabilities for fines and 
failures 
• Increasing complexity of business 
• Rising deficits and poor historic risk 
adjusted returns 
• Fund and counterparty failures 
• Restricted investment universe, limited 
ability to identify and manage risks in and 
across investments (function of firm size. 
scale and expertise) 
• Increasing regulation of permissible 
instruments. Greater capital requirements 
• Growing need to discover, disclose and 
reduce costs 
• Need to improve operating efficiencies

investment universe with assurances, tools 
and services to better select and manage 
investments

counterparties. with means to manage risks 
and breaches

evidential proof of process to show 
management and regulators

• Leverage scale benefits via industry 
consortium 
• One stop solution for all funds 
• Better performing and risk-adjusted assets, 
ability to switch counterparties 
• Transparency to use sophisticated investment 
techniques. e.g. ALWLDI 
• Access to a universe of investments and 
counterparties the terms and access to which 
are comparable and standardised 
• Reduce capital requirements and pass 
investment risk to end clients 
• Migrate to a capital-light model 
• Obtain transparency on fees and reduce costs 
• Generate scale benefits via industry 
consortium 
Requirements of solution 
• Framework to aggregate funds, managers and 
counterparties to create investible universe 
• Data and controls over these to enable the sale of any 
type and style of fund 
• Position-level data to identify risks and centralized 
database with common definitions 
• Clear mandates with and controls over managers, 
counterparties and assets 
• Consistent, continuous and clean position level data 
across all investments in central data base 
• Approved and transparent governance process 
• Flexible reporting framework 
• Pooling of fragmented investments and centralised 
counterparty management 
• Shared infrastructure to spread cost 
• Clear and agreed mandates and terms 
• Continuous data on underlying positions to measure 
risks, exposures. correlations and contagions 
• Access to collateral for cost-effective hedges 
• Pool managers, funds and counterparties into a single 
framework 
• Understand risks within profiles to better select and 
create investment portfolios 
• Qualified universe of comparable investments with 
consistent terms and datasets and tools
