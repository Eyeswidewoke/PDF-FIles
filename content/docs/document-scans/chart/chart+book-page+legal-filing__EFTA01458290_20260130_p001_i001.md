Special Report: The treat Accumulation' Is Over: FX Reserves Have Peaked. Beware OT 
with a stronger broad dollar. 12m forwards give some indication of this pressure 
on the the dirham and particularly rival pegs over the past fortnight (Figure 21l 
We expect Middle Eastern governments to continue to lose significant reserves in 
the coming months. Low oil prices are only one ingredient in the mix. The 
exacerbating factor is our economists' prediction that the main dollar pegs in Saudi 
and the UAE will hold, albeit at considerable costs in terms of reserves.4
One reason for our economists' confidence in the pegs is that both governments 
can afford to withstand the pressure. They note that Saudi FX reserves have fallen 
by 10% since last September but remain abundant at $665bn, roughly 100% of 
GDP. As shown by Figure 21, pressure on the Saudi peg was also considerable in 
1998 when FX reserves amounted to a third of today's stocks and government 
debt, now negligible, stood at 100% of GDP. And yet the peg held. 
Nor is there a compelling macroeconomic incentive for SAMA to devalue. Given 
the economy's export dependency on oil, which is invoiced in USD, a weaker riyal 
would not make it significantly more competitive. The net effect would be 
negative due to higher import prices. The same arguments can be made more 
forcefully for the UAE, which retains even greater assets and a stronger fiscal 
position. Hence, until oil prices recover meaningfully, both governments and 
central banks will likely continue to bleed fast.

If oil prices do recover in the medium term, pressure on the pegs would naturally 
diminish. Our economists note, however, that Saudi public spending has increased 
by about 10% a year over the past decade. This has lifted the oil price needed to 
balance the budget from $25/bbl in 2004 to 8105/bbl (Figure 22/. This may be 
reduced with government spending cuts. Yet it seems unlikely that the budget 
breakeven will fall back to levels seen in the 2000s. Unless oil prices rise to 
unprecedented levels, therefore, OPEC reserve accumulation is unlikely to return 
to the run rate of the past decade. The more realistic baseline is that, over time, 
OPEC countries will slowly burn reserves.
