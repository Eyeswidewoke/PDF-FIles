Focus Europe: Dark clouds, no storm yet 
and a resilient financial system. Indeed, in comments to Radio 5's Wake Up To 
Money programme BoE Deputy Governor Broadbent said that it was important 
not to over-emphasise the reduction in the Bank's growth forecasts which he 
described as not being a large revision; rather, he focused on the supportive 
fall in oil prices and continued expectations for robust growth in Europe.

The explanation behind the fact that a weaker economic growth forecast did 
not generate a fall in inflation below the 2% target 2-3Y hence was that the 
Bank simultaneously lowered its view on demand and supply growth. The 
weaker supply story was in part related to lower average hours which the Bank 
now expects because workers are more confident in taking annual leave given 
strong real wage growth and increased job security. 
In terms of the Bank's other conditioning forecasts, it is worth focusing on the 
household sector. Consumer spending growth was revised down this year and 
next, the result of weaker incomes. Indeed, both average weekly earnings and 
real post-tax income growth were seen as weaker relative to three months ago, 
which explains why it takes an even larger fall in the saving ratio on the BoE's 
forecasts (to 2.5% on average in 2017• IC) in order to achieve a slower rate of 
consumer spending growth. This contrasts with the OBR's November 2015 
forecast for the saving ratio during the same period of 4.4%, nearly 2pp higher 
than that of the Bank of England. 
Figure 4 shows the evolution of the Bank of England's forecasts for average 
weekly earnings growth. The scale of revisions to expectations has been 
sizable, partly reflecting weaker productivity during recent years (which the 
Bank expects to return to more normal rates) but also to some extent past 
weakness in inflation. While nominal wage growth in 2015 has surprised on 
the downside by 200bps relative to what was expected two years ago, the 
decline in expectations for CPI inflation over the same period has been similar 
(around 170bps for the year). In other words, real wage growth last year did 
not disappoint that much relative to BoE expectations made in early 2014. 
What are the implications for monetary policy? Interest rate markets (SONIA) 
are currently pricing in a 40% risk of a 25bps rate cut by year-end, while 3m 
LIBOR futures rates are not pricing in a rise in rates until the very end of 
2017/early 2018. Our view is for a rate rise in November - we pushed this back 
last month from our previous view of May. With question marks over global 
growth and emerging economy threats to fragile financial markets, the risks to 
our rate hike view remain for a delay. However, if the BoE's forecasts prove 
right - resilient domestic demand, rising inflation and wage growth - then that 
could yet be consistent with increasing rates later this year.
