World Out€ook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Japan: Return to steady recovery trend 
• 
We forecast the Japanese economy to return to underlying trend growth of 
real GDP at annualized 1.0-1.5% after a temporary soft patch in Q2 and Q3 
2015. 
• 
We see low likelihood of meaningfully negative second-round effects from 
the global slowdown to domestic non-manufacturers despite an inevitable 
impact on the Japanese manufacturers. 
A soft patch, not a roots: eon 
Real GDP shrank 0.20/agog (annualized -0.8%) in Q3, the second consecutive 
negative contraction, but we do not think this means the economy has entered a 
recession because of the large negative inventory contribution in O3 growth and 
the low accuracy of Japanese preliminary GDP estimate. Our Nowcast index 
(DBNCI) has been revised upward and is now trending gradually higher. We 
think the Japanese economy was in a soh patch in Q2 and O3 but these 
instances were mild and transitory and should be followed by real final sales 
(GDP minus inventories) growth at an underlying trend of an annualized 1.0-1.5%. 
Resiliency of non-manufacturing sector 
Because the scale of the ongoing global economic slowdown from early 2015 
is limited compared to the collapse of the IT bubble in 2000-2001 or the global 
financial crisis of 2007-08, we forecast a low likelihood of meaningfully 
negative second-round effects from the global slowdown to domestic non-
manufacturers, thus leading to a recession, despite an inevitable impact on the 
Japanese manufacturers. 
Predicting an expansion in domestic demand (mainly private consumption) 
Although we predict a return to an economic expansion with annualized 
growth of 1.0-1.5% from O4 2015, this is likely to be driven not by exports but 
rather by domestic demand (in particular private consumption). Nominal 
so 
aggregate wages (= total cash earnings per person x number of employees) 
are maintaining growth of an annualized 2.0-2.5% and inflation is predicted to 
converge at around 1%, so 1.0-1.5% growth in real aggregate wages is 
probably the underlying trend. Therefore, we think real private consumption 
could maintain annualized growth of 1.0-1.25%.
