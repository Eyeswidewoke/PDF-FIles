the NIIP is given by the ratio between the persistent current account level and the 
steady-state growth rate.' Biasing the exercise against our argument by setting 
both variables to 2%. the NIIP would become stationary at around 100% of GDP. 
Comparative benchmarking yields somewhat lower estimates. The vast foreign 
asset stocks accumulated by Switzerland or oil-rich Norway, both well over 100% 
of GDP, reflect greater saving rates and degrees of openness than the Eurozone 
will ever attain. Japan's NIIP of around 70% is in a more realistic ballpark. 
Ultimately, no single G10 country serves as a perfect benchmark, and the most 
plausible assumption is that the Eurozone as a whole will converge to a NIIP of 
around 50%, the level currently seen in its core group of creditor nations—Belgium, 
Germany end the Netherlands. 
The most data-driven approach is to pool all stock-flow observations for the G10 
space ex-Sweden over the past twenty years. A simple regression suggests that 
the current extemal surplus of the euro area would be consistent with a NIIP of 
roughly 30%. This estimate varies by a few percentage points as one includes 
time and/or country effects, effectively running a panel regression.6 Yet while this 
exercise necessarily remains indicative, it does yield a strong sense that the stock-
flow adjustment will not be complete at any NIIP levels below 30% of GDP. 
On this baseline estimate of a terminal NIIP of 30%, the Eurozone would need to 
invest 40% of its current GDP abroad in net terms, at least in the absence of 
valuation and growth effects. This amounts to a staggering E4 trillion. Assuming 
net financial outflows of E150bn a quarter, this process will take the rest of the 
decade. 
With the exchange rate being endogenous to this process, the depreciation of the 
Euro caused by large outflows will both speed up the process and reduce the 
outflows required for adjustment. A weaker Euro raises the value of European 
assets abroad, mechanically raising the NIIP. A sensitivity analysis indicates that 
further Euro depreciation by 20% would shave only around 10% off the outflows 
implied by a 30% NIIP. 
From an FX perspective, it is irrelevant whether adjustment is driven by capital 
outflows or exchange rate valuation: the Euro will continue to depreciate through 
ether channe' Importantly, the fall in the Euro since O3 cannot have fully priced
