Q4 surgery/mix recovering; 2014 / 
ACA outlook conservative 
Reiterate Buy. F ICA's it:sure: demomtrate best in breed 
(14 operating metrics were not given at time of early Jan. +ve pre-anncmt. 
Actual results highlight a recovery in surgical trends, which boosted 
pricing/mix and helped drive solid C14 EBITDA growth (+6.7% YoY) despite 
weaker inpt medical trends and a tough vol comp. HCA provided initial ACA 
guidance, but mgmt may revisit assumptions on key ACA variables mid-year 
given how fluid the roll-out is. For 2014. ACA initially guided -$100M (+1.5%) 
EBITDA benefit underpinned by 7%-9% reduction in uninsured and slight offset 
by pricing/vol impact for exchange mix. Given strong organic growth trends in 
recent Qs, we believe 2014 EBITDA guidance should prove conservative. 
Q4 CC.: tal.oawaytt fret:O1(S uview rn Itcrely of note) 
11) Volume/prbIng metrics: surgery the bigger story. Weak SS inpt admits (-
1.8%) reflect tough comp, lower flu trends and -50 bps from 2-midnight rule. 
Importantly. HCA does not see 2-midnight rule having material financial 
impact. The bigger vol story in O4 (and last 3 Qs) is surgeries; Q4 surg vol 
(+1.4%) and strength in higher-acuity areas (cardio, ortho, neuro) helped drive 
pricing (RPAA) +4.8% YoY. The ratio of inpt surg / inpt admit rose to 30% (from 
-29% avg past 2 yrs) and ratio is 200-300 bps below peak. A sustained 
rebound in surgical mix could be an upside risk to guidance. 
'(2) 2014 guidance assumes 1%-4% EBITDA growth. Underlying assumptions 
(ex. ACA) include 1-2% adj. admit (vol) growth. 2-3% RPAA (pricing) growth 
and flat margins. Given 2H'13 RPAA growth (+4%) and recovery in surg. RPAA 
seems conservative. Guidance assumes adj. vols improve vs. 2013 flat. The 
key headwinds built-into guidance: $120M lower YoY HITECH and $55M 
higher YoY stock comp which impact growth by 300 bps vs. DBe orig est 200 
bps. We believe guidance implies 2%-5% base growth ex headwinds and ACA. 
'(3) ACA commentary: a reasonable starting point. HCA framed ACA impact as 
a L-T positive, but key variables remain very fluid this year including: (I) 
enrollment for exchange and Medicaid; (2) net new lives; (3) networks and plan 
selection of exchange products. HCA assumes 7-9% reduction of uninsured 
(reasonable) but offset somewhat due to leakage and pricing (conservative). 
Updated estimates: modest adjustment:- to reflect HI TECH, slower /AGA ramp 
2014 EBITDA / EPS are $7.056 / $3.92 from $7.1456 / $4.17. We come out 
above guidance (56.606-$6.856 EBITDA / S3.45-$3.75 EPS ) due to underlying 
growth and ACA. Our model now reflects higher S/O, slightly lower HITECH 
benefit, slightly lower ACA ramp but slightly better rate/mix. 
Valuation and risks: PT remains at $58 or 7.5x 2015 EV/EBITDA 
Our target multiple is in-line with group's L-T average of 6.5x-7.5x. Key risks: 
implementation of PPACA, payer mix changes, Medicare/Medicaid cuts.
