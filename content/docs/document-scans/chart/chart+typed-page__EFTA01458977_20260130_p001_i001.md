World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
From a market perspective, a potential tapering discussion will help support a 
partial normalization of core euro rates sometime next year. The timing of the 
repricing could depend on several factors, including the risk from EM countries 
and oil prices, which we discuss below. From a pure domestic perspective 
though, the dynamics of inflation and the unemployment rate would suggest a 
repricing in the second half of the year. 
Fed: Irregular tightening 
Now that a December hike seems likely, the market shifted its focus on the 
pace and terminal rate of this hiking cycle. It is now generally accepted that 
the rate cycle will be shallower than the most recent tightening cycles. 
Currently the market is pricing that the neutral real rate (estimated as 4YIY 0IS 
minus 2%) will remain close to zero. One side of the argument for low neutral 
real rates is a structurally lower level of productivity (the secular stagnation 
argument). Productivity has indeed been close to historical lows during this 
recovery. However, the uptick in real wages since the trough of the recession 
would suggest that there could be some upside to productivity from these 
levels. This would be particularly the case if wages do follow the leading 
indicators, which suggest some improvement towards 2.5% yoy on a nominal 
basis (around 1% in real terms based on current core PCE forecasts).

Others (including the Fed) argue that real rates have been low because of 
headwinds, namely tight fiscal policy, tighter regulation and credit supply, 
weaker demand for credit due to balance sheet repair and general macro 
uncertainty (fiscal cliff, Europe, China etc...). For Chair Yellen, we expect the 
normalization of policy will be driven not by an increase in GDP growth, but 
rather by the fact that the neutral real rate will drift up. The improvement in 
lending conditions and the marginally more supportive fiscal policy would also 
argue for some upside risks for the neutral rate. Irrespective of which side 
proves to be correct (within our own research team, the views are mixed), 
given that the market is de-facto pricing secular stagnation, the risks are to the 
upside in yields.
