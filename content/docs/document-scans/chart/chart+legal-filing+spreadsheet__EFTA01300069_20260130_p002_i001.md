The buying if intermediate IC bonds at current yields of 8%+ seems attractive and we have recently added 3% to our non-
tax paying client portfolios. Adding leverage to the mix has the potential to further increase the upside of the return, but 
depending upon the economic outcome and level of leverage used can also be fairly bad as well. There are 2 issues we 
have with leveraging fixed rate IC bonds- first is what happens to spreads, then where do treasuries go. 
Bear case: Spread blows out to 900 (from 600) and UST's at 1-2% cant rally anymore and are unchanged. Unlevered 
downside risk is fair, with a negative total return of 10% in one year. However, even moderate 2 or 3 times leverage 
quickly turns -10% to -25%-35%. While I admit spreads have never been 900, up to this quarter they had never been 600 
either, so I am hesitant to put a cap on where they can go.

Bull case: Spread return to 300, high historically but reasonable as economic outlook is still mixed. UST still 1-2% as fed 
has done quantitative easing, buying longer term UST's to keep term structure of government rates low. Unlevered 
returns of 25% and 2-3 times leverage quickly gets to 50-70%.

Moderate case: Spread rally back by 200bps to a still high 400 over, but US treasuries also give up some of their current 
"flight to quality bid" and return to 2.5% levels from 1.5% current levels. Assuming we did not have any duration hedge 
here, we lose part of the spread rally from the higher risk free rates. Still a positive story overall, 14% unlevered, 25-35%
