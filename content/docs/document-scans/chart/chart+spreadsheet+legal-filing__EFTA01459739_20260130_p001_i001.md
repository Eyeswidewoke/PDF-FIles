Real Assets: Commodities 
— Volatility within the oil market continues. Last 
week, crude oil bounced off of its lowest level 
($28.35/barreff since 2003 and moved above the 
key psychological 530/barrel barrier. A report that 
Russia was ready to negotiate with OPEC to cut 
production helped support prices. 
— However, as optimism on Russia's actions faded, 
crude oil posted its worst two-day decline 
(-11.1%) since March 2009 (Monday & Tuesday). 
— With NYMEX crude oil shorts remaining near a 
record high, financial positioning will continue to 
foster volatility in the oil markets in the near term 
as any news may drive sharp price moves. 
— However, as prices remain depressed, we do not 
believe that the current output level of U.S. 
producers is sustainable over the long term. As 
of January 29, U.S. production has fallen only 4% 
since its record high in June 2015 while rig 
counts have fallen over 60% since their peak. 
— Given unsustainable production levels, we 
believe that oil production will begin to come 
offline. As it does, we believe that crude prices 
will rise to 550/barrel by year-end 2016.

Data as of January 29. 2016. 
— As U.S. economic data has been weaker than 
expected and the Citigroup Economic Surprise 
Index has fallen to an eight month low, the 
futures market has shifted and is not pricing in an 
additional Fed rate hike until 2017 at the earliest. 
As a result, the Dollar Index is on pace to post its 
worst week since May 2009. 
— We believe that this move in the USD is 
overdone and given the strong labor market and 
expectation for a moderate rise in growth and 
inflation, there is still justification for the Fed to 
continue raising rates this year (our estimate is 
two rate hikes). 
— In addition, the BoJ's decision to adopt a 
negative interest rate policy and the likelihood of 
additional policy measures by the ECB in the 
coming months should support the USD as the 
policy divergence continues. 
— We expect the USD to strength to .95 against the 
EUR and 125 against the JPY by year-end 2016.
