With rising property sales - year-to-date residential property sales in terms of 
square meters of space are up about 8% after having fallen 9% last year - and 
declining inventories (residential housing starts were down 14% last year and 
are down 18%ytd this year - developers are starting to prepare for the next 
cyclical recovery in investment. Land sales, measured both in physical and 
value terms are rising again. 
These are encouraging leading indicators that broader property investment 
growth - which has been trending down for most of the last three years and is 
currently near all-time lows - could recover in early 2016, restoring an 
important source of growth to private domestic demand. 
Conclusion 
This note has set a relatively modest objective: 
debunking the idea that 
growth has suddenly slowed sharply in China. There is no evidence that a hard 
landing is underway in China. Instead, a gradual slowdown in growth partly 
for deep fundamental reasons seems likely to continue. 
Effective 
implementation of reforms of the kinds that we have discussed repeatedly in 
this forum - especially to the allocation of capital - could slow or possibly 
temporarily reverse the decline in potential GDP. In the near term, stimulus 
measures are likely to take growth very slightly higher in Q4 - our forecast is 
7.2%yoy GDP growth. Upside risk exists to the 2016 outlook if the recovery in 
property markets that has been gathering strength over the past year leads to a 
recovery in property investment, something that in our experience very few 
investors expect ever to see again. 
We remain skeptical of the hard landing argument because we don't see how 
it would occur. True, China's credit/GDP ratio is rising unsustainably. But it 
need not end in a crisis. A recovery in export demand or reforms to improve 
the allocation of capital could both allow GDP growth to be sustained at a 
relatively high level without relying on increased leverage. China's inherent 
advantages of a current account surplus, high net foreign assets (13 % of GDP) 
and low external debt burden (about 10% of GDP) offer a significant 
counterweight to the risks of a crisis posed by a high creditIGDP ratio. A 
'sudden stop' of international capital of the kind that in the past has triggered 
emerging markets crises seems unlikely to cause a crisis in a country that has

and the current account." HOAR Working Paper No 2942014, November 2014. for an explanation of just 
how important it is to have a currem account surplus as a defense aganst a banking crisis.
