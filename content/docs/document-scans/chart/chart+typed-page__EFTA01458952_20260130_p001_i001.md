World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Global outlook 
Disappointing global growth to pick up slightly next year 
Growth in global economic activity is now projected to bottom this year and 
rise gradually toward trend by 2017, led primarily by an acceleration in 
emerging market economies. We expect global growth will have dipped to 
3.1% in 2015, its slowest pace since the global financial crisis in 2009. This 
slowdown has been driven primarily by a deceleration in emerging market 
economies, where growth is expected to have fallen by more than one-half of 
a percentage point from 2014. The sharp contractions in Russia and Brazil are 
the main reason for this deceleration. Conversely, faster growth in the euro 
area and Japan implies a modest pickup in growth in advanced economies this 
year. 
Over the next two years changes in the global growth outlook are likely to be 
driven entirely by fluctuations in emerging market growth. Next year growth is 
projected to rise gradually, as the severe contractions in Russia and Brazil 
moderate. This should help boost emerging market growth by almost one-half 
of a percentage point, even with growth slowing further in China. But the 
emerging markets growth story is not simply a technical one: recent declines 
in export growth should reverse, albeit weakly, providing a more positive basis 
for recovery than the 'less bad' Brazil and Russia outlooks. Growth in advanced 
economies should remain stable at just below 2% in 2016. as a more-than-
doubling in growth in Japan and a slight pickup in the euro area offset 
deceleration in the US. Further acceleration in global economic activity in 2017 
is likely to be due to additional improvement in Russia and Brazil, while a 
pickup in India and stability in China would imply a modest acceleration in 
emerging Asia. Advanced economy growth is once again expected to remain 
just shy of 2% in 2017, despite a halving of growth in Japan.
