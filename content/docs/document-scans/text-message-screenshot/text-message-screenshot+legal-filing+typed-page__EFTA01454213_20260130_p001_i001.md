the least tax-efficient. But, because of its much lower 
turnover, the benefit of tax deferral is much lower than 
Asset Class 2. 
Based on the example in 'Deferral Benefit," you 
might think that we've settled on tax drag as the best 
measure to determine the tax deferral benefit of an 
asset class. But, that's still not quite right. Though tax 
drag is a better measure of tax deferral benefit than 
tax rate or expected return alone, it fails to account 
for the effects of compounding on any tax deferral 
benefit.' As "Effect of Compounding: p. x, illustrates, 
when we examine the returns over a long period of time. 
the tax deferral benefit of each asset class changes. After 
20 years, the tax deferral benefit of Asset Class 1 is 
almost 300 percent, confirming conventional wisdom. 
So, why is this the result? Simply put, the tax liability 
saved each year will grow at the asset class's rate of return. 
The greater the annual return, the more powerful the 
cumulative tax deferral benefit, even if the tax drag is 
lower. In fact, return can have such an outsized effect on 
the long-term tax deferral benefit, that some asset classes 
that have a relatively low tax drag can exhibit surpris-
ingly strong long-term tax deferral benefit. 
New Evaluation Metrics 
Taking all of this together. we make use of metrics that 
can help evaluate the utility of owning any asset class in 
a tax-free environment: one for vehicles like PPLI, in 
which taxes should never be realized, the tax-exemption 
multiple (TEM) and its counterpart 
for vehicles like PPVA, when taxes 
might ultimately be paid. the tax-
deferral multiple (TDM). The mul-
tiples measure the combined effects 
of tax drag and compounding to 
understand the overall tax-exemp-
tion (or tax-deferral) benefit over a 
given period. 
"Better Predictors: p. x, demon-
strates that, compared to tax drag, 
both TEM and TDM more accu-
rately predict the long-term tax 
deferral benefit of an asset class. 
In this example, we assume that 
in Year 20, the portfolio will pass 
without income tax (TEM) or will 
JUNE 2014 
be fully withdrawn and taxed (TDM). In both cases the 
TEM and TDM are superior predictors of the asset class 
with the greatest tax deferral benefit in Year 20. 
Next, we put the metrics to work in actual asset class-
es. "Asset Class Assumptions and Tax Deferral Benefits," 
p. x, shows a number of asset classes with our long-term 
(10 year) expected returns, yield and turnover. We cal-
culated tax drag in the conventional way and also calcu-
lated TEM (20 years) and ranked them by TEM. 
An interesting observation from this chart is that

hedge funds aren't among the top five asset classes offer-

fact, they aren't even in the top 10. This casts serious 
doubt on the conventional view that hedge funds arc
