FBI Daily News Briefing 
stolen from a sacred man's village house. The article quoted Chris McKeough, who works for the FBI's art crime 
team, "New York is the art capital of the world, and because of that, is the art crime capital of the world, we don't 
know who looted them or took them out of the country, but there is a market in the world for human remains, 
they are trafficked unfortunately and they are collected." McKeough added that the size and weight of the Vanuatu 
effigies posed the greatest logistical challenge the FBI's crime team has ever faced. The largest is almost 12 foot 
long and weighs in at 700 pounds. "They are extremely fragile, probably the most fragile objects that we have ever

Tonga Leader Says Police Provide 'Freedom From Fear', Support Democracy 
Reuters (09/03, Needham) reported that Tonga's Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni underscored the role of police to 
provide "freedom from fear" in democracies in a speech to Pacific Islands police chiefs on Tuesday, noting the rising 
global focus on the region by major powers. A top U.S. counter-narcotics official will travel on Wednesday to Tonga, 
where the first U.S.- Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police dialogue will be held on the sidelines of the regional police 
body's annual conference. The article stated that U.S. Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of International Narcotics 
and Law Enforcement Affairs, Todd Robinson, will travel to Tonga on Wednesday, U.S. officials said. Robinson is a 
key figure in the U.S. response to its fentanyl crisis, and said in congressional testimony last year the synthetic drug 
is trafficked through Mexico using diverted precursor chemicals sourced from China. The article mentioned that 
two Chinese nationals, suspected of involvement in a fentanyl supply syndicate were expelled by Fiji and arrested 
by the FBI in Hawaii last year. The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said in Vanuatu last week, after 
meeting Pacific Island leaders, that Washington will work with the region to rein in drug trafficking by criminal 
networks using it as a way station for narcotics exports to the United States.
