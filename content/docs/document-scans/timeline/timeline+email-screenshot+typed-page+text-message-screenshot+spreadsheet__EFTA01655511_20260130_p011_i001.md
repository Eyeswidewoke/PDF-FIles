CYBER DIVISION 
Continued Reporting: US Indicts Three Cyber Pros Who Moonlit for Ransomware Gang 
Computer Weekly (11/05, Scroxton) reported that US prosecutors have indicted three cyber security professionals, 
Kevin Tyler Martin, Ryan Clifford Goldberg, and an unnamed individual, for allegedly extorting organizations using 
the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware. According to a September FBI affidavit, their cyber crime spree began in May 
2023, when the unnamed conspirator obtained an ALPHV/BlackCat affiliate account which he shared with Goldberg 
and Martin — who is identified in the affidavit as Co-Conspirator 2. They split the profits they made between 
themselves after paying the gang its 'share. The money was laundered through a mixing service and multiple 
crypto wallets. The article noted that the indictment highlights the risk of insider threats, with experts emphasizing 
the importance of rigorous access controls, regular behavioral reviews, and a culture that encourages open 
communication and wellbeing checks to prevent such incidents. Security Affairs (11/05, Paganini) also reported on 
the story.

disclosed the number of people affected or the type of information accessed. Bleeping Computer (11/05, Abrams) 
added that the University of Pennsylvania says it notified the FBI of the breach and is working with CrowdStrike to 
investigate the security incident. 
Three of the Biggest Cybercrime Gangs Around Appear to Be Teaming Up 
Tech Radar (11/05, Fadilpasic) reported that the three biggest cybercrime gangs, Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and 
ShinyHunters, have merged into a federated cybercriminal brand known as SLH, which operates mainly on Telegram 
and uses Extortion-as-a-Service to target victims and demand ransoms. According to the article, the group's 
behavior is characterized by a mix of financially motivated cybercrime and attention-seeking tactics, similar to 
those used by hacktivists, with SLH using dramatic language, polls, and public taunts against law enforcement 
agencies, such as the FBI and the NCA, while its main motive remains financial gain rather than ideology.
