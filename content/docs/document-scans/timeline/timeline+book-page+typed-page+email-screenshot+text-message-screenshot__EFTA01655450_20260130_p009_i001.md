scheme and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The article noted that critical assistance for the extradition 
was provided by the Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern

Experts Urge Parallel Probe Into Ambassador Nathi Mthethwa's Death In Pads 
Saturday Star (10/01, Mahlangu, Phungula) reported that experts, including criminologist Thabang Bogopa, are 
urging a parallel investigation into the death of South African Ambassador Nathi Mthethwa, who died after 
allegedly falling from a hotel in Paris. According to the article, South African authorities can use the Mutual Legal 
Assistance in Criminal Matters Act to request cooperation from French authorities and conduct a parallel inquiry at 
home. Criminologist Thabang Bogopa told IOL that Interpol should take over the investigation. "However, they 
should tie up with the investigation units of France but also go further and include the FBI because it is a high-
priority offence to have a diplomat dying suspiciously in another country," Bogopa said. The article noted that 
parliament also has the power to demand accountability and oversight into Mthethwa's death, including 
summoning officials to testify and reviewing evidence collected from French authorities. Additional reporting was 
provided by Magic 828-AM (10/01, Staff Writer).

Trump's DC Crime Emergency Is Over. Immigration Officers Are Still Patrolling With DC Police 
The Washington Post (10/01, Uber, Armus) reported that weeks after President Trump's crime emergency order 
expired, immigration authorities have continued patrolling with D.C. police, raising concerns among residents and 
city leaders about local officers' role in immigration enforcement. According to the article, court filings, videos, and 
eyewitness accounts show D.C. police working alongside Homeland Security agents, with at least two men ending 
up in ICE custody, and in one incident near a charter school, parents and children witnessed officers from 
Homeland Security Investigations, Customs and Border Protection, Enforcement and Removal Operations, and the 
FBI alongside D.C. police. The article noted that Mayor Muriel Bowser initially denied the collaboration but later 
acknowledged it, while school officials and community leaden warned that such joint operations threaten trust in 
D.C. police and violate the city's Sanctuary Values Act. 
Commerce Secretary Lutnick Calls Ex-Neighbor Epstein "Greatest Blackmailer Ever" 
Axios (10/01, Falconer) reported that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, speaking in a new interview, called 
Jeffrey Epstein the "greatest blackmailer ever" and claimed Epstein gained wealth through blackmail tied to his 
massage room activities. According to the article, Lutnick's comments contrasted with the Justice Department's and 
FBI's July findings, which stated there is "no credible evidence" that Epstein blackmailed powerful individuals or 
kept a "client list;' and Director Patel testified last month that there was "no credible information" Epstein 
trafficked young women to others besides himself. The article noted that Lutnick described leaving Epstein's home 
immediately after seeing a massage table, speculated his activities were recorded, and questioned the leniency of 
Epstein's 2008 plea deal, while the FBI and DOJ did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment on 
whether they would investigate Lutnick's claims.
