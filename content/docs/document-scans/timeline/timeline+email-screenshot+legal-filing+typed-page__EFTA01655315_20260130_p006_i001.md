Ukraine in 2022. The Russian state's collaboration with Russian-based organized crime (RBOC) groups allows for 
plausible deniability and cost-effective disruption of enemies, while also empowering these criminal 
networks. RBOC groups have been used for covert actions, including assassinations, and have been covertly taxed 
by the FSB to fund Russian covert operations, making them a useful resource for Russia, especially with its 
degraded intelligence capacity. The author assessed that the FBI's Counterintelligence Division and the U.S. State 
Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs should increase liaisons with national 
and local law enforcement in RBOC hotspots. The CIA and FBI should also increase cooperation with intelligence 
agencies in areas where RBOC groups are most active, especially regarding Russian dissidents.

WLS (ABC-7) (07/22, Nagy, Markoff, et al.) reported that a standoff at the Dirksen Federal Building in downtown 
Chicago ended after roughly 9 hours when federal agents rushed toward a man armed with a knife in the building's 
lobby. The man, who had been in the lobby since 11 a.m., was taken out on a stretcher with a wound on his neck 
and will be taken to a hospital, according to a U.S. Marshals spokesperson. The article noted that no one else was 
injured in the incident, which is being investigated by the FBI and involved a mandatory evacuation order and 
lockdown of the building earlier in the day. "The FBI has the best hostage negotiators in the world. They are doing 
everything they can to avoid a catastrophic incident," Derek Mayer, former Secret Service deputy special agent in 
charge, was quoted as saying. Additional reporting on the story was provided by WBBM (CBS-2) (07/22,

Minneapolis Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston Sr. in the press release. "These alliances are essential, for 
they weave a fabric of shared intelligence and resources that fortify our collective resolve against violent crime,
