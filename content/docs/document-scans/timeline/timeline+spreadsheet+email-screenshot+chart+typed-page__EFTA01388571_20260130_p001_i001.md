For such a widely used tool, it is surprising how hard it is to make QE work in 
theory, The trouble is that any such framework must take its longer-term impact 
into account. Fortunately, central banks not much keener than stage magicians to 
let you in on the inner workings of their latest creations. Asa result, it is fairly easy 
to figure out what is known --and, more worryingly, what even central banks do not 
know. 
We know from empirical studies in the United States, the United Kingdom, and, in 
recent years, the Eurozone and Japan, that OE "works" in the short term in terms 
of moving markets, and perhaps, even increasing lending. We have some ideas on 
why this might be so. It remains unclear, however, how QE will impact inflation, 
economic activity and asset prices across the economic cycle. 
From a theoretical perspective, we know that households and firms will try to 
anticipate future central-bank actions which risks offsetting much of what the 
central bank is doing through the channels described above in the here and now. 
To take the example of the wealth effect, let's say that the Fed buys 30-year bonds 
today, drives down nominal market rates and thereby increases the nominal value of 
the longer maturity bonds I hold in my portfolio. On paper, this makes me wealthier. 
If I am rational, though, I will know that returns on any additional bond investments I 
make to save for my retirement will be lower. Moreover, if and when QE does its job 
in restoring full employment, interest rates will increase, so I will face losses in the 
future. 
My real wealth, over my remaining life-time, has not really gone up, and there is 
little reason why I should boost my consumption. Instead, I might even decide to 
save more!

market operations do and do not 
impact the private sector, see

operations. American Economic
