said, "We have limited resources, so the FBI agreed to provide further assistance with the case that eventually led 
to a living relative, that person's DNA was confirmed as a match to Paula." Lundgren, who had lived primarily in the 
Chicago area, would have been 29 when a farmer found her body in September 1991 in a cornfield in northern 
Illinois' LaSalle County, authorities said. The coroner's office determined at the time that the woman had died from 
cocaine intoxication. Her unidentified body was eventually buried in an Ottawa cemetery with a headstone reading, 
"Somebody's Daughter, Somebody's Friend." The LaSalle County sheriff's office said now that Lundgren's identity is 
known the agency hopes "new leads can be developed as to how she came to be in the cornfield." 
D.C. Council Votes to Disband Trayon White's Committee, Begins Probe 
The Washington Post (09/17, Flynn) reported that the D.C. Council on Tuesday voted to disband the youth affairs 
committee chaired by Council member Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8) after his arrest last month on federal bribery 
charges, and began its own investigation into the allegations — which could lead to White's possible removal from 
the council. The article added that it was the council's first meeting since the explosive accusations from the 
FBI that White agreed to accept roughly $156,000 in bribes in exchange for using his influence as a council member 
to try to secure lucrative contracts for an associate, who was working as an informant for federal officials. 
White pleaded not guilty last week. According to the article, the contracts at the center of the bribery case were for 
violence-intervention work at two agencies — including the Department of Youth Rehabilitative Services, of which 
White had oversight as chairman of the Committee on Recreation, Libraries and Youth Affairs. Given that leadership 
role, Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) sought to disassemble the committee and put all agencies under the 
entire council's purview instead. 
Tennessee Offidal and Executive Accused of Rigging a Bid on a $123 Million Contract Are Charged 
The Associated Press (09/17, Loller) reported that a former Tennessee prison official and a former executive at a 
private contractor have been charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and commit perjury after they were 
accused of rigging a bid on a $123 million contract, federal prosecutors announced Tuesday. In a lawsuit filed in 
2020, Tennessee-based prison contractor Corizon claimed the Tennessee Department of Correction's former chief 
financial officer, Wesley Landers, sent internal emails related to the behavioral health care contract to former Vice 
President Jeffrey Wells of rival company Centurion of Tennessee. Centurion won the contract, and Landers got a 
"cushy" job with a Centurion affiliate in Georgia, according to the lawsuit, which was settled in 2022. A statement 
from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee announced on Tuesday criminal charges against 
Landers and Wells. A DOJ press release noted that this case was investigated by the FBI, Memphis Field Office, and 
Nashville Resident Agency.

Frontier Airlines Passenger Assaults Flight Attendants, DOJ Alleges 
CBS News (09/17, Castaneda) reported that a California man is facing federal charges after allegedly causing a 
violent disturbance and assaulting flight attendants on a Frontier Airlines flight from Orange County bound for San 
Francisco. The U.S. Attorney's Office from the Central District of California said in a press statement Thursday that 
30-year-old Charles Angel Salva of Fremont was arrested Wednesday after his flight from John Wayne Airport in 
Santa Ana was diverted to Ontario International Airport shortly after takeoff. The article stated that according to a 
federal complaint, as the plane was climbing, flight attendants noticed oxygen masks had dropped from the 
overhead compartment above one of the seat rows; they found that a passenger, identified as Salva, had his hand 
in the overhead compartment. A passenger told flight attendants that Salva appeared claustrophobic and had 
pulled the oxygen mask down, getting his hand stuck in the compartment, the complaint alleged. One of the flight 
attendants noticed Salva looked to be in distress and he began yelling obscenities, also saying "we are all going to 
hell," and "this airplane is going down," the complaint said. The flight attendant said Salva began violently grabbing 
at passengers and then ran to the rear of the plane where the attendant tried to enlist the help of other passengers 
to restrain him, according to the complaint. As the flight attendant and others tried to restrain Salva, he allegedly 
grabbed the lanyard around the flight attendant's neck and tried to choke her with it, the complaint said. A second
