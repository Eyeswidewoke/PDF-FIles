FBI Daily News Briefing 
South Dakota Highway Patrol Seized Over Two Hundred Pounds of Meth From Non-citizen 
South Dakota Public Broadcasting (08/11, Dircks) reported that South Dakota Highway Patrol troopers seized 207 
pounds of methamphetamine, valued at $12 million, during a traffic stop on 1-90 in Sturgis after a police dog 
detected the drugs in a speeding vehicle. The driver, a 42-year-old non-U.S. citizen, was arrested on felony drug 
distribution and possession charges, as well as possession of drug paraphernalia, and was later transferred to 
federal custody. Officials say it is the largest drug seizure in the agency's history and part of Operation: Prairie 
Thunder, a state initiative led by Governor Larry Rhoden to combat crime and drug trafficking. The bust involved 
multiple agencies, including the DEA, FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, the South Dakota Division of Criminal 
Investigation, the Meade County Sheriff's Office, and the Rapid City Police Department. Additional reporting was 
provided by KELO (CBS-11) (08/11, Engelkes) and The Dakota Scout (08/11, Staff Writer). 
Wisconsin Man Indicted on Wire Fraud, Money Laundering Charges 
99.9 FM WSAU (08/11, Leischner) reported that Stanley Pophal, a 63-year-old Wausau man, has been indicted by a 
federal grand jury on 10 counts, including wire fraud and money laundering. He is accused of taking money from 
investors for business ventures, but instead used it to maintain his lifestyle, including buying over 300 
snowmobiles. Pophal faces decades in prison if found guilty, with the FBI, IRS, and an Assistant U.S. Attorney 
involved in the investigation and prosecution. Additional reporting provided by The 715 Newsroom (08/11, 
McCarthy). 
Two Michigan City Council Members Charged With Election Fraud 
WJBK (Fox-2) (08/11, Nissen) reported that two Hamtramck City Council members, Mohammed Hassan and 
Muhtasin Sadman, have been charged with multiple felonies, including forging signatures on absentee ballot 
applications and election law forgery, after a two-month probe by a special prosecutor. The investigation, launched 
at the request of suspended City Manager Max Garbarino, alleges the council members conspired to obtain 
unvoted absentee ballots from newly naturalized citizens and fill them out for preferred candidates. The case 
unfolds amid broader political turmoil in Hamtramck, including Garbarino's lawsuit against the council and 
separate allegations reported to the FBI by a suspended police officer about the city's police chief. The scandal has 
intensified tensions within the city government, leading to a series of high-profile suspensions involving the city 
manager and police chief. Additional reporting provided by The Detroit News (08/11, Hunter), News from the 
States (08/11, Davidson), WDIV (NBC-4) (08/11, Jones), and WXYZ (ABC-7) (08/11, Staff Writer) 
Virginia Social Worker to Pay $1.2m in Medicaid, Medicare Fraud Cases 
Augusta Free Press (08/11, Graham) reported that Daniel Jacobsen, a 72-year-old psychotherapist from Richmond, 
was convicted of criminal healthcare fraud and ordered to pay $1.2 million in restitution, forfeiture, fines, and civil 
settlements. He pleaded guilty in October 2020 to knowingly submitting fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims, 
including billing for services not provided and falsifying progress notes. The scheme included charging for more 
than 16 hours of services in a single day and inflating service complexity to receive higher reimbursements. The 
case was investigated by the FBI and Virginia's Medicaid fraud control unit. 
Florida Man Charged With Defrauding Virginia Doctor 
WSLS (NBC-10) (08/11, Staff Writer) reported that Tommie Lee Nelson, a 65-year-old Florida man, was arraigned in 
U.S. District Court in Roanoke on six counts of wire fraud for allegedly defrauding a Lynchburg doctor out of nearly 
$500,000. Between 2020 and 2021, Nelson posed as a hard money lender for a commercial building purchase in 
Danville, but prosecutors say he instead spent the victim's funds at casinos and for personal expenses. The victim 
later won a civil judgment, and the case was referred for criminal investigation, leading to Nelson's July arrest by 
FBI agents at his Miami-area home. Additional reporting provided by Augusta Free Press (08/11, Graham) and 
WDBJ (CBS-7) (08/11, Johnson). 
North Carolina Man Faces Charges After FBI Tip 
WCTI (ABC-12) (08/11, Staff Writer) reported that Jeffrey A. Rouse Jr., 28, of Greenville, North Carolina, has been 
arrested on 29 charges stemming from allegations of elderly exploitation and identity theft. The charges include 
one count of felony elder exploitation, 27 counts of felony identity theft, and one count of attempted obtaining 
property by false pretenses. The Pitt County Sheriff's Office began its investigation after receiving a tip from the FBI 
about the possible unlawful taking of funds from an elderly victim. Rouse was booked into the Pitt County 
Detention Center on a $100,000 secured bond, and investigators say additional charges are possible as the case 
develops.
