violently with police, and his sentencing reflects ongoing legal actions against over 1,400 individuals charged with

OTHER FBI NEWS 
Law Enforcement Brace as Anti-Israel Groups Vow to Bring Tens of Thousands of Protesters to DNC in 
Chicago 
Fox News (08/15, Hagstrom) reported that anti-Israel groups are planning a massive show of force at the 
Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week as the party plans to celebrate Vice President Kamala Harris' 
nomination. The U.S. Palestinian Community Network will bring in busloads of protesters from Minnesota, 
Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin and elsewhere. The group is organizing the event under the hashtag "March on DNC 
2024," with leaders arguing there is no daylight between Harris and President Biden when it comes to Israel-Gaza 
policy. The article stated that federal, state and local law enforcement say they are aware of and are currently 
monitoring plans for the protest and any threat they may pose to the convention. The article mentioned that the 
FBI says it is also monitoring the event, but said in a statement that it is not aware of any specific threats. The 
article quoted the FBI, which said, "At this time, the FBI is not aware of any specific and articulable threats related 
to the DNC, we will continue to evaluate and share intelligence received from domestic and international partners 
related to the DNC just as we would for any large-scale event within the Chicago area." 
New York Police, FBI Team up in Wake of Rise in Overdoses 
WNYT (NBC-13) (08/15, Bentulan) reported that the Saratoga Springs Police Department is bolstering its resources 
by partnering with the FBI. The city held a news conference on Thursday to tout its partnership with the federal 
agency to tackle a number of cases. One particular problem is an increasing number of fentanyl overdoses. The 
article mentioned that Public Safety Commissioner Tim Coll said the city's Woodlawn Avenue parking garage has 
been a drug hotspot. Coll mentioned that a March arrest raised a red flag for authorities. A person was arrested on 
weapons and drug charges, which included fentanyl trafficking. Coll said police had two potential fentanyl 
overdoses in 2022 and eight potential ODs in 2023. So far this year, there have also been eight ODs and an 
additional two deadly overdoses. Coll said finalizing their partnership with the FBI is sort of a formality. That means 
they can use the same resources and intelligence as the FBI and have access to everything the federal agency has.
