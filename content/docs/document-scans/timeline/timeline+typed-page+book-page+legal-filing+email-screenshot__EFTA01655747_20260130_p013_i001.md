Fox News (01/27, Whitten) reported that squatters have staked their claim on land in Arkansas, claiming that they 
are part of a sovereign citizen group known to have engaged in violent confrontations with law enforcement. The 
article added that in a press release, Sharp County Sheriff Shane Russell said that the investigation into the 
squatters began in August 2023. Authorities said that they were alerted to a couple who moved into an RV and an 
"enclosed property" owned by someone else. The pair allegedly built a permanent structure, dug a septic line, 
installed solar panels, and began storing large amounts of water. The article noted that on Thursday, Jan. 25, a large 
group of law enforcement executed a search warrant on the squatters and arrested the two individuals without 
incident. Authorities said that the pair initially refused to identify themselves, but that the male suspect identified 
himself as Saleem Yosiyah YisraEl. The article mentioned that authorities said that they found multiple vehicles on 
the property with "fictitious license plates." Along with the illegal vehicles, authorities found evidence of illegal 
scams that the pair were conducting from the RV. The scam involved the Postal Service and several thousand 
dollars of Iraqi currency, police said. Authorities concluded that the FBI is investigating the alleged fraudulent 
documentation and cybercrimes.

Sextortion Training Materials Found on TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, According to New 
Report 
NBC News (01/27, Kolodny) reported that a form of cybercrime called "financial sextortion" is rapidly rising in 
North America and Australia, with a major portion driven by a non-organized cybercriminal group in West Africa 
who call themselves "Yahoo Boys," according to a new study from the Network Contagion Research Institute 
(NCRI). The article added that sextortion is "a crime that involves adults coercing kids and teens into sending 
explicit images online," according to the FBI. The criminals threaten their victims with the wide distribution of 
explicit images, including to the victims' friends and family, unless the victims pay them, repeatedly, through a 
variety of peer-to-peer payment apps, cryptocurrency transfers, and gift cards. NCRI, a nonprofit, found 
cybercriminals used the social apps Instagram, Snapchat, and Wizz to find and connect with their marks. The article 
noted that Yahoo Boys' tactics gained popularity among some as a way to get rich quickly in West Africa, where 
there are scant other means of earning income, according to a 2023 Atavist investigation. Popular songs 
referencing Yahoo Boys have lent the cybercriminal gangs cultural clout. The article mentioned that in the U.S., 
people who have experienced sextortion (or their parents or guardians) can report it via the FBI's cybercrime 
portal IC3.gov online, or a local FBI field office.

to retrieve their data. The article added that BlackCat reacted strongly to the operation. The Ransomware-as-a-
Service (RaaS) first regained temporary control of its dark website, then maintained the FBI had only reached a part 
of the infrastructure. According to the cybercriminal group, the authorities' operation made it impossible to 
decrypt the data of 3,000 additional victims. The article stated that to encourage its affiliates to continue launching
