CYBER DIVISION 
FBI Pushes Back Against Scrutiny Over Cyber Cuts, Vacancies 
Bank Info Security (09/19, Riotta) reported that Director Patel defended the bureau's handling of cybercrime 
investigations amid criticism over staffing cuts, leadership changes, and low morale during a tense Senate Judiciary 
Committee hearing. Director Patel told senators that cybercrime arrests had increased by "40, 50, 60%" despite top 
cyber officials departing, and he claimed those positions were replaced by "supremely qualified individuals," 
though he refused to name them when pressed. According to the article, Democratic senators accused Director 
Patel of overseeing retaliatory firings tied to Trump-focused investigations, while multiple former FBI officials 
warned of a "real loss of institutional knowledge" and growing fear within the bureau as experienced cyber agents 
left. The article noted that the FBI's 2024 Internet Crime Report showed $16.6 billion in cybercrime losses, a 33% 
increase from the previous year, and that the bureau recently warned about hackers spoofing its own Internet 
Crime Complaint Center site to steal data. Director Patel also pushed back against claims that election interference 
investigations had been limited, insisting that no FBI resources had been diverted from those operations. The 
article highlighted that Director Patel has replaced the FBI's former assistant director for cyber operations, Brian 
Vorndran, who left the public sector and joined Microsoft as the firm's deputy CISO in May. Veteran FBI official 
Brett Leatherman announced in a Linkedln post that he was selected to take over the role in June, writing that "FBI 
Cyber sits at the intersection of law enforcement, intelligence, and national defense" and is "uniquely positioned to 
impose cost on our cyber adversaries while supporting victims of cybercrime."
