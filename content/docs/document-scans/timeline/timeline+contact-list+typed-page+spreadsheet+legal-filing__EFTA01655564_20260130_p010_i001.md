FBI and BBB Issue Holiday Scam Warning to Shoppers Amid Rising Fraud Risk 
WCNC (NBC-36) (11/25, Riley) reported that the FBI and Better Business Bureau (BBB) are warning holiday 
shoppers about a surge in scams during the holiday season. According to the article, scammers are using various 
tactics, including fake charity appeals, phishing emails, and social media ads, to target consumers, according to 
Juliana O'Rork with the BBB. The article noted that consumers can protect themselves by verifying secure websites 
(looking for HTTPS), watching for typos, and reporting suspicious activity to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint 
Center or the BBB's Scam Tracker. The Record (11/25, Greig) highlighted that the FBI said there has also been an 
increase in search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning, where cybercriminals place ads on platforms like Google 
that look like legitimate e-commerce websites but are not. "Once the impersonators have access and control of 
the accounts, the cyber criminals quickly wire funds to other criminal-controlled accounts, many of which are 
linked to cryptocurrency wallets; therefore, funds are disbursed quickly and are difficult to trace and recover," the 
FBI said. "In some cases, including nearly all social engineering cases, the cyber criminals change the online 
account password, locking the owner out of their own financial account(s)."

FBI Seeks Industry Input on Biometric Algorithms, AI-Driven Tattoo Recognition 
Biometric Update (11/25, Kimery) reported that the FBI has issued a Request for Information (RFI) to gather 
industry input on the next generation of biometric matching algorithms, including AI-driven tattoo recognition. 
According to the article, the RFI focuses on five categories: fingerprints, facial recognition, iris recognition, and 
tattoos, with the aim of enhancing the Next Generation Identification (NGI) system. The article noted that the FBI is 
partnering with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to evaluate the capabilities of industry-
developed algorithms, with a focus on accuracy, reliability, and scalability for law enforcement use. 
Remains in 1981 California Cold Case Identified 
KCBS (CBS-2) (11/25, Hylton) reported that the Ventura County Sheriff's Office has identified the remains of a man 
in a 1981 cold case as Thomas Aquinas Cooney, a Vietnam War veteran. According to the article, Cooney's remains 
were found in 1981 along Highway 33 in Ojai, but the cause of his death could not be determined. In June 2004, 
the Medical Examiner's Office submitted evidence to the U.S. Department of Justice for DNA analysis, the VCSO 
said. Only a partial profile was obtained through the investigation, which was insufficient for an entry into the FBI's 
Combined DNA Index System. The article noted that advances in DNA technology and a DNA sample from a family 
member led to the identification of Cooney, with detectives now seeking information about his life and 
circumstances before his death.

Ghana Must Not Sabotage the Office of the Special Prosecutor 
My Joy Online (11/25, Dadzie) reported that the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) in Ghana has faced criticism 
and hostility since its conception, with many viewing it as a political tool or a duplication of existing institutions. 
According to the article, despite its challenges, the OSP has made notable achievements under Kissi Agyebeng, 
including prosecutions, convictions, asset recovery, corruption prevention, and strengthening partnerships with the 
Audit Service, FBI, UNODC, and Interpol. The article noted that the OSP deserves support and space to grow, rather 
than being sabotaged, as it is a crucial institution in the fight against corruption in Ghana, and its collapse would be 
a loss for the country.
