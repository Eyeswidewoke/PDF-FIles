an updated advisory on the group, warning that the gang has shifted its tactics and is now moving toward extorting 
companies with stolen data instead of fully encrypting systems. The group has exclusively focused on exfiltration-
based extortion since January. The advisory notes that like many ransomware gangs, the likely Russia-based group 
has used its name "to misattribute location and nationality by choosing foreign-language names, almost certainly 
to complicate attribution efforts." The article mentioned that the group has been seen targeting public-facing 
applications of both Windows and ESXi infrastructure, possibly leveraging the popular ProxyShell vulnerabilities.

North Korea Hackers Behind 2019 $42 Million Ethereum Heist, South Korea Police Say 
Reuters (11/21, Staff Writer) reported that South Korean police said on Thursday an investigation confirmed that 
hackers linked to North Korea's military intelligence agency were responsible for an Ethereum cryptocurrency heist 
in 2019, worth 58 billion won ($41.5 million) at the time. The article added that more than half of the stolen assets 
were laundered through three crypto exchanges set up by the hackers themselves at a discount to Bitcoin and the 
rest were laundered through 51 different exchanges, the National Police Agency said. The article noted that the 
hackers infiltrated a crypto exchange where the Ethereum was being kept and stole 342,000 tokens, now valued at 
more than 1.4 trillion won ($1 billion), the police said in a statement. It did not name the exchange but South 
Korea-based Upbit exchange said at the time it had detected the transfer of 58 billion won of Ethereum to an 
unidentified wallet. The article mentioned that the police said its findings were based on an analysis of Internet 
Protocol addresses used and the subsequent flow of assets. The probe was conducted in cooperation with the FBI 
and it was the first time North Korea had been identified as the source of a cyberattack on a crypto exchange in 
South Korea, police said. In May, a panel of United Nations sanctions monitors said it suspected North Korea 
mounted 97 cyberattacks on cryptocurrency companies between 2017 and 2024 valued at about $3.6 billion.

NBC News (11/20, Reilly) reported that Edward Kelley, a Donald Trump supporter and anti-abortion activist, has 
been convicted of plotting to kill FBI agents who investigated him for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, US Capitol riot. 
According to the article, Kelley was found guilty of conspiracy to murder employees of the United States, 
solicitation to commit a crime of violence, and influencing or retaliating against federal officials by threat. The 
article explained that Kelley's trial in Knoxville featured testimony from co-defendant Austin Carter, who pleaded 
guilty in November 2023. Carter told authorities that he and Kelley plotted "to murder employees of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation" in December 2022, months after Kelley's arrest on Jan. 6 charges. Kelley provided a list of 
about 37 members of law enforcement who worked on his Jan. 6 case, prosecutors alleged. Additional reporting on 
the story was provided by the Associated Press (11/20, Staff Writer), Fox News (11/20, Casiano), the Washington

Trump-Nominated Judge Says Blanket Pardons for Capitol Rioters Would Be 'Beyond Frustrating' 
The Associated Press (11/20, Kunzelman) reported that U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump nominee, 
expressed frustration at the possibility of blanket pardons for Capitol rioters, calling it "beyond frustrating and 
disappointing". According to the article, Nichols made the comment during a hearing for Jacob Lang, a Capitol riot 
defendant, whose trial was postponed until after Trump's inauguration. "Blanket pardons for all January 6 
defendants or anything close would be beyond frustrating and disappointing, but that's not my call," Nichols said, 
according to a transcript. "And the possibility of some pardons, at least, is a very real thing." The article noted 
that Nichols is one of many judges handling over 1,500 cases related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, with some 
defendants hoping for pardons from Trump. Additional reporting on the story was provided by the Washington
