MANAGEMENT FOCUS I ACCOUNTING 
that, like me. most yacht crew had 
gotten into the life of sailing to avoid 
things like spreadsheets. Accounting 
— with no offence intended to 
accountants — is pretty much the 
opposite of sailing. So how, with all 
of today's reporting requirements 
and need for fiscal transparency, arc 
captains and managers coping? 
I am a journalist, not an accountant 
(some of you may not know that), 
but that's not the point: any software 
I have used for tabulating sums and 
building some kind of report (Excel, 
Quicken and a custom program I used 
years ago when I worked for a hospital 
 
 was bafflingly over-spec'd. 
They're almost always made to be 
too powerful, and inevitably offer 
tools, templates and functions that I 
would never need. Using them was 
like having to perform gastric surgery 
each time I wanted to take a pulse. 
So. although I don't manage a yacht's 
finances. I feel equivalent to those 
who need to manage budgets and 
account for spending — we've tried to 
avoid spreadsheets our whole lives. 
According to our industry insight, 
most managers and captains work 
with general accounting software 
like Access, Quicken, TAS. Sage and 
others, which arc then customised 
to their offices' and yachts' needs. 
Other managers, captains and owners 
will have taken the technical step 
of commissioning custom software 
"Crews are getting 
more professional and 
management companies 
are following more 
reporting rules. It might 
be that accounting will 
be one of the next areas 
to get more attention." 
to enable them to simplify their 
own processes... and many of these 
solutions are no doubt excellent. The 
big management houses have invested 
in their own custom systems.

Patrick Moussa at Master Yachts 
explained that they are currently 
developing new software for their 
clients that forms part of their wider 
management software platform. The 
new system. MYConnect, will be a web-
based portal that will allow owners. 
managers and crew to access their 
yacht data. The software, according to 
Moussa, is an Integration of Microsoft 
Dynamics AX 2012 and SharePoint 
2010, with some third party add-ons 
and custom code. It'll allow owners 
and crew to access ISM and statutory 
documents, real-time accounting data, 
and it will eventually tie into their 
package management system as well. 
It's a very serious investment that is 
taking a lot of effort to put in place 
and will enhance dramatically what we 
have today? 
Another company that's developed 
accounting solutions as part of 
their wider management solution 
is the German firm SpecTec. 
Tobias Allebrodt explained that the 
accounting tool they offer for their 
yacht clients through their IDEA 
platform is designed for petty cash 
aboard, and uses different accounts 
for different currencies for individual 
cost centres on the yacht. Allebrodes 
sense of what the clients are looking 
for, however, is telling. 
"We've been approached by a few 
companies interested in developing 
very detailed accounting software 
for yachts, but, from our point of 
view, the issue is, at the moment, 
overestimated: Allebrodt said.
