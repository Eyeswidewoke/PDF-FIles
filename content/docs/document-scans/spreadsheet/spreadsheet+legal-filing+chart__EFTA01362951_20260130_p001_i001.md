CYES is an overlay that seeks to exploit the volatility risk premium and time decay properties of option premium by actively managing a portfolio of 
short-dated index option spreads on the %PSC° index (SPX). CYES sells options to generate premium while purchasing further out of the money 
options to contain risk. In a disciplined manner the strategy will seek to mitigate exposure to market directional or gap risk by defensively adjusting 
positions in response to a large move or reducing exposure ahead of specific market events.
