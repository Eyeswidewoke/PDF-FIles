For the European Central Bank (ECB), less dollar strength than expected is 
unwelcome, as Mario Draghi, the ECB's president noted on January 21. Amongst 
other things, it means that the fall in the oil price will continue to have an even more 
negative effect on headline Eurozone inflation figures. Even at constant exchange 
rates, the recent fall in the oil price means that energy will continue to be a bigger 
drag on Eurozone prices for longer than previously thought (see chart below).

Rightly or wrongly, this risks causing renewed deflation fears if oil falls further. 
At least in the short term, it is hard to see what the ECB will be able to do about 
this, apart from offering reassuring words that it remains ready to provide further 
stimulus, as Draghi has already done. 
And this, perhaps, gets to the core of the problem. The boom in U.S. shale 
exploration did not come out of the blue, Instead, U.S. energy was one of the 
many beneficiaries of the increasingly desperate search for yield we have seen in 
recent years. Just as central banks in industrialized countries had hoped when they 
embarked on QE, higher prices for relatively safe investments such as government 
bonds drove investors into ever riskier assets. As we will see below, emerging 
markets were another favorite destination, leading to sharp increases in debt levels, 
especially in the corporate sector. In turn, debt-fuelled growth in emerging markets, 
notably China, helped boost demand for oil and other commodities. 
It is probably no coincidence that within weeks of the Fed implementing its first 
hike, both oil and emerging markets have become major sources of volatility. This 
also provides new ammunition for skeptics of QE programs, worried about the 
longer-term implications for capital allocation and economic stability more broadly. 
How low could Eurozono inflation 
go? 
Lower oil pnces would delay the rise in 
Eutozone inflation by pushing down the cost 
of energy in year-on-year comparisons we 
have been expecting an increase of 1.2% for 
2016, but acknowledge the downsides to 
this scene no. If oil continues to tradearound 
current levels and ends the year 2016 at 
$30/b. we would expect average yearon -year 
increases of just 0.3% in the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices tHICIT). HICP is 
the indicator of inflation and price stability 
preferred by the ECB. The EC8 targets 
inflation rates of below. but close to, 2% in the 
liiCP.
