Cost Basis on fixed income securities may be adjusted for amortization, accretion, original issue discount adjustments, or principal payd owns. The calculation is based upon the taxpayer 
election, type of fixed income security, and certain attributes. obtained from sources believed to be reliable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there may be a temporary 
incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those 
involving foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with less t han one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the 
preparation of your tax returns.

Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share. it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual 
fund. Shares of a money market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds 
credited to your brokerage account. Please see the money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for 
additional information. Pursuant to SEC Rule 10 b-10( b)( 11 confirmations are not sent for purchases into money market mutual funds processed on the sweep platform. 
The U.S. will adopt a shortened settlement timeframe beginning with trade date September 5, 2017, for equities, corporate and municipal bonds, and unit investment trusts. M oving 
from a T*3 to a 1-42 settlement cycle will provide faster access to sale proceeds, but it also means that funds will be due on purchase transactions earlier. This may be a good time to 
consider e-delivery of your account documents-including trade confirmations, account statements and more. Ask your advisor or financial insititut ion about how you can set up 
e-delivery.
