Spectrum Asset Management! Principal 
o' 
Spectrum Preferred Securities is managed to an intermediate duration. and is predominantly 
comprised of $25 Par Preferred Securities that trade on the NYSE. Spectrum feels that because retail 
investors are the primary owners of $25 Par Preferred Securities, there is more inefficiency, and more 
trading opportunities that can be exploited than are usually found with other fixed income sectors that 
are owned primarily by institutional investors. Spectrum's strategy provides yield enhancement over 
traditional fixed income portfolios without subjecfing the portfolio to increased credit risk. 
Spectrum invests in issues that offer high quality. risk-adjusted yield premiums and 
compensation for any subordination, liquidity, maturity, and call differences. Only issuers whose 
senior unsecured debt is rated BBB-. or above by at least two credit rating agencies are 
included in Spectrum's investment universe. Key drivers in the security selection process are 
credit strength and yield. For a security to be considered for investment, the credit status of the 
issuer must be improving or stable. The security yield must be attractive, given the credit rating 
and credit trend relative to other preferred securities. Sell decisions can be either a function of 
a credit development or recognition that the preferred yield has become "rich" relative to the 
debt level. Approximately 30-40% of the portfolio will qualify for the 15% tax rate on dividends.

Spectrum underperformed the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Preferred Stock Fixed Rate Index 
(P0P1) in O1 (+1.0% vs. +1.6%). During the quarter, relative underperformance came from a 
variety of areas, including Domestic Banking, Foreign Banking, Industrial, REIT Preferreds, and 
Utilities. From a security selection standpoint. Banking names that were relative detractors 
included Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, UBS, and HSBC. Additional detractors included General 
Electric. Public Storage. Aegon, Partner Re. and the Southern Company. Conversely, sectors 
that generated relative gains for the Strategy included Life Insurance, Media, and Foreign 
Reinsurance. Among the names that provided positive contributions to return were Royal Bank 
of Canada, Met Life, BofA, US Bank, Renaissance Re, American Express, and Capital One. 
The Manager continues to believe that due to Preferreds' subordinated nature and subsequent 
yield prenaum, they offer an attractive opportunity versus high-yield, corporate, and U.S. 
Treasuries. This Strategy seeks to maintain a target allocation to qualified dividend investments 
of 30-40%. 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
