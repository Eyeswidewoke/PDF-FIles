Several reasons probably account for this. 
There is sheer size, of course. Energy became the single largest sector in the U.S. 
high-yield market during the shale boom. At current market values, it still accounts 
for about 11%. Exploration and production only accounts for 3.5% to 4%, and better 
quality issuers within this group have started to look cheap. 
Not so long ago, oil indeed looked like a "known problem". The effects looked 
certain to be contained to a relatively small part of the U.S. high-yield segment. 
However, other activities have some exposure to falling oil prices as well, especially 
if the initial decline is followed by a long slump. Whether a pipeline operator with 
operations near the Bakken shale rigs, say, will get into trouble partly depends on 
how soon oil prices and with it shale production - will recover. In assessing such 
risks, fundamentals matter. For example, you would need to consider where exactly 
the assets of the pipeline operator are and if, say, they could be used for imports 
instead. Sentiment and technicals are important factors, too. It is often not that easy 
to separate these three factors, especially when it comes to high-yield bonds. If an 
issuer defaults, an investor risks losing everything. And that becomes more likely if 
spreads widen and issuers find it harder to refinance. So, it is rational for investors to 
require a higher yield in anticipation, in turn widening spreads further. This becomes 
a particular issue when tough credit conditions are expected to last for a while. 
For much of the past year, optimists have pointed to the maturity profile of high-
yield issuers and the fact that only 1% needs to be refinanced in 2016. However, 
that portion steadily rises from 2017 on, until it reaches a peak of about 22% in 
2022. The picture is similar for high-yield issuers in the energy sector. With fear 
growing that oil prices will be lower for longer, and spreads higher, this means more 
companies will be at risk of defaulting during the next few years. Moreover, more 
companies in the same sector defaulting at roughly the same time may result in 
forced sales. Already, bankruptcies in the second half of 2016 rose to 28, compared 
to 13 in the first half.

Financing conditions are worsening 
Some $360bn worth of HY bonds have, been 
issued by U.S. energy companies since 2003. 
most of it front shale oil and gas producers. 
Redemption is not an urgent issue in the next 
three years, with only $35.5bn due until 2019. 
The avast important message of the chart. 
however, is that financing conditions are 
worsening. While in the first half (1lfi of 2015 
new equity worth 514.6bn and $23.9bn worth 
of bonds was issued, this declined to 53.3bn 
and $4 Obn (Source. Dealogic) in 2142015. 
This would suggest declining production 
before too long, as U.S. shale-oil output is to 
a significant extent a function of how much 
money is invested.
