The "Other" 40 Million Barrels a Day 
and the Call on US Crude Growth 
The Coming Highs & Lows of Non-OPEC Production (and what It means for US) 
While significant attention has been dedicated to the analysis of the US supply 
dynamics over past 6 months, we turn our attention to the less-well 
understood 40 MMb/d of global crude production (ex-OPEC, ex-US onshore, 
ex-NGLs), and the outlook for the coming 2-5 years. Key takeaways: 1) Don't 
expect a major roll-over in Non-OPEC supply through 2017, 2) we still see a call 
on US onshore growth of 500 Mb/d in 2017 with 2H16 ramp 3) we likely need 
$65-$70/bbl oil to incentivize and support this growth, 4) post-2017, Non-OPEC 
shortages to drive rapidly escalating call on US crude and price inflation. 
Waiting for the Non-OPEC collapse? Don't hold your breath 
Despite significant capital cuts (20% across our global coverage), and fears of 
massive Non-OPEC declines, our analysis suggests greater than expected 
resilience in global Non-OPEC production through 2017, as a slug of major 
projects works its way through the system. Between 2015 and 2017, we 
estimate annual, major project-driven growth barrels of 1380 Mb/d, vs. the 
historical rate of 970 Mb/d between 2004-2013. supporting annual Non-OPEC 
supply growth of 150-200 Mb/d through 2017. 
But, there is a call on US onshore oil growth - the new swing producer 
Even with moderate growth in Non-OPEC production, solid global crude 
demand will still result in a call on US onshore production growth, although 
not likely until 2H16 (+350 Mb/d by 4016), rising to -500+ Mb/d in 2017. With 
current activity levels resulting in slightly declining US onshore production in 
2H15, we see the need for increasing activity into late 2015/early 2016 to meet 
a rising call on US crude into 21116. OPEC production, however, remains a 
looming risk, where current elevated levels of production (May 2015 estimated 
31.6 MMb/d vs. our assumed 30.5 MMb/d target), a lifting of sanctions in Iran, 
or Saudi strategy could push the US call further into 2017. 
$55ibbl oil isn't going to suffice 
Single well economics aside, corporate level cash flow suggests higher price is 
necessary to incentivize sufficient activity. We estimate an average oil price of 
$70/bbl to support moderated volume growth (ie. 35%-40% of pre-collapse 
peak rate) within producer cash flows. This falls to $60/bbl breakeven when 
spending 120% of cash flow. In other words, we will need a higher price than 
where we are today to make the US onshore "machine" work. 
Post-2017? Hold on to your hat... 
By late 2017, rising declines and deferred FIDs will drive a rapidly escalating 
call on US supply. Major oil project FIDs fell to 6 in 2014, the lowest level in 15 
years, well below the average of 23/yr since 2000, with 2015 likely to be even 
lower. With an average of 1.2 MMb/d of capacity sanctioned a year over the 
past 10 years, the hole left by deferrals will be difficult to address, sending the 
call on US crude growth north of 1,000 Mb/d/yr by late this decade. 
Thriving in moderation - Stocks to own; Upgrade OX? to Buy; Cut HES to Hold 
Given the relatively cautious medium-term oil price outlook, our preference 
remains largely for names whose combination of asset quality and balance 
sheet allow them to support moderate, capital efficient growth within a 
moderate oil price environment. We upgrade OXY to BUY and downgrade HES 
to HOLD. Other preferred names include MRO, DVN, EOG.
