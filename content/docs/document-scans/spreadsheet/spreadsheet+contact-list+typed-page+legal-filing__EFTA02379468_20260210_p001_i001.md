Regan Ails - Base Scenario 
2015 Income Statement & Cash Flow 
Key Assumptions 
Revenue - Income Statement 
Revenue derived is based on the lay down quantities as proposed by RA Sales team (done in conjunction with S&S) 
• Laydown quantities are the quantities that the sales team are committing to sell 
- The selling list price is reduced by the average discount rate of 53%. (This is the industry standard discount rate) 
- The model assumes laydown occurs during the month of publication of the book 
• Returns then occur 3 months after laydown. Return rates vary based on category of book: 
- Fiction 50% 
- Other 40% 
- Illustration 30% 
• The model spreads the returns over 3 months: 60% in Month 1, 20% in month 2 and 20% in Month 3 
Exoenses - Income Statement 
Most expenses are based on the expenses per the Individual Title Budgets which are prepared by Production Director 
- PPB (Paper Print & Binding) unit cost comes from the individual title budgets. 
- Plant Expense (Costs to Develop the book) unit cost again comes from the individual title budgets. 
• PPB and Plant expenses units are based on the laydown units less the returned units and match the month of revenue and returns. 
Royalties are based on the % contractually agreed on each title - Royalty %and expense increases based on the number of books sold. 
Note in the P&L for simplicity we booked royalty expense in total during the laydown ( Publication month) (Units are laydown quantities less returns). 
- Selling and Distribution (paid to our distributor) is 13% of Revenue. The contract stipulates a flat 10% but also includes additional charges, 
such as special packaging, etc. and this model assumes an additional 3%. 
Marketing & Promotion (M&P) spend comes from the individual title budgets. As a guide $1.00 per hardcover copy $0.50 to $0.75 per paperback. 
Freight spend comes from the individual title budgets. 
- M&P and Freight expense is booked in total during the publication month. 
Cash Flow - Inflows 
- Cash is received 60 days after invoicing/publication. (e.g. February revenue is paid In April) 
- Note during months where no books are published, returns of earlier publications could result in negative revenue. 
- Cashflow model shows the total revenue and selling & distribution on a separate line (note actual cash received is the net of these 2 lines). 
Cash Flow - Outflows 
- Royalty Advances (14) are the commitments we have made in 2014. These are the installments that we have to pay per title in 2015. 
- Royalty Advances (15) is a placeholder for advances on titles that will be produced in 2016 and beyond. The model front loads (75%) in the first half of 2015. 
- PPB payments occur In the month of invoicing/publication and are based on the total print run per the individual title budget, not the laydown quantities. 
Plant expense payments occur in the month of invoicing/publication and are based on the individual title budget, not laydown quantities. 
- Other expenses (salaries etc.) are based on the P&L and occur in the month the expense is occurred. 
- The Cash flow Model also includes a capex placeholder of $240k.($200k in leasehold improvements for the proposed move and $40k in Computer equipment, printers etc.)
