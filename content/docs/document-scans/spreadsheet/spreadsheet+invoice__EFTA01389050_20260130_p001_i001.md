Adelante Capital Management 
Real Estate (REITs) 
As 030 2016 
Adelante's investment philosophy is founded on the belief that the values of the underlying teal estate assets will 
20.0 
uksmately drive stock performance over the king term. In the short term, the stock's price may diverge from the 
18.0 
real estate operating value due to a variety of factors. including broader equity trends, interest rate measures and 
16O 
corporate events. The portfolio management team attempts to take advantage of these arbitrage opportunities, 
buying at a discount to fall value and selling at a large premium.

Adelaide adheres to specilic investment guidelines to achieve pedormance objectives and to manage portfolio risk. 
8.0 
Adelaide maintains a preference for 'core' institutional real estate property typos (o.g. apartments, office, industrial 
6.0 
and retail), avoiding securities in narrovAy focused specialty real estate companies that they believe will not deliver 
adequate long-term returns in relation to the level of risk assumed. M a diversification measure, accounts must be 
4.0 
exposed to at least three property types. In addition, companies with a market capitalization of less than $100 
milNon are screened out to avoid illiquid securities.
