Focus Europe: Dark clouds, no storm yet 
This supports our baseline case - that the UK will vote, on June 23, to remain 
in the EU by a relatively narrow margin roughly similar to that of the Scottish 
referendum in 2014 (i.e. around 55%145%). Until recently, the opinion polls had 
been showing broadly equal support for "In" and "Out" (40% each) with 20% 
unsure. However, polls have generally been moving in favour of the "leave" 
camp - the latest by YouGov shows a sizable rise in support for exit, as 
indicated in Figure 2 above. 
This should be heavily caveated, however. First, it is just one poll conducted 
soon after the announcement by Mr Tusk. Second, the polls shift far more 
substantially in favour of remaining in the EU if the PM is supportive of the EU 
deal and willing to campaign vigorously in favour of remaining in (which it 
seems he is). And finally, given the performance of the polls ahead of the 
Scottish independence vote and particularly last year's general election, we 
should beware putting too much weight on the polls generally. 
How did the EU agreement offered this week compare to Mr Cameron's initial 
demands? On immigration, the UK requested that it stop in-work benefits to 
EU migrants until they have lived in the UK for four years. Instead, an 
"emergency brake" was offered allowing the government to initially exclude 
migrants from such benefits, then gradually rising over a four year period. The 
government wanted to ban child benefit to migrants' children living overseas, 
but instead the EU requested that it be paid at the local (rather than UK) rate -
which may prove a logistical effort for the government. On sovereignty, the UK 
requested a "red card" system to block legislation - this was accepted, with 
the caveat that 15 of the 28 parliaments would need to agree in order to take 
effect. There were also commitments allowing the UK to undertake no further 
political integration and for the EU to respect subsidiarity - 'European 
legislation where necessary, national where possible'. 
Economic governance and competitiveness reforms were less detailed, but a 
safeguard procedure was suggested allowing non-euro countries to halt 
legislation if they thought it was against their interests (versus the interests of 
eurozone countries) - though this does not go as far as being a non-euro veto 
and has not yet been fully fleshed out. The UK is also exempted from future 
eurozone bailouts and financial supervision/macro-prudential oversight. 
In summary - this week's agreement goes quite some way to addressing the 
PM's reform agenda, though in many cases the proposals are either watered 
down, require more detail, may yet be rejected by the European Parliament or 
are distant promises of treaty change.
