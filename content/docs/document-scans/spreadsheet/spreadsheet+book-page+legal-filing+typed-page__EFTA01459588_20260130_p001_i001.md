Global Economic Perspectives: China's evolving FX policy 
Dollar bloc 
Canada 
It appears likely that the significant erosion of investor confidence due to 
volatile commodity prices and the freighted concerns about the global 
economy will dampen investment well into the second half of the year. Despite 
this drag, overall growth should benefit from a further strengthening of non-
commodity exports fuelled by an expanding US economy as well as by the 
impact of an increase in spending on infrastructure promised by the recently 
elected Liberal government. Based on this scenario we expect the output gap 
to gradually narrow over the course of the year causing the Bank of Canada to 
begin to tighten late in the final quarter of this year of early in the first quarter 
of 2017. 
Australia 
Our expectation of a broadly stable unemployment rate over 2016, with some 
prospect of a modest decline further down the track should see the RBA cash 
rate end 2016 at its current level of 2.00%. That said, the prospect of another 
low CPI in late January could see some risk of an RBA rate cut in February. It 
appears, however, that the RBA will look through another soft inflation print, 
given the improvement in the labour market and business conditions. 
New Zealand 
Our central view remains that 2.5% will remain the low-point for the OCR this 
cycle, not least due to the RBNZ's reluctance to move the OCR lower. However, 
we certainly do not rule out the possibility of further easing in H1-16, with 
domestic drought conditions, unexpected exchange rate strength, further 
commodity price weakness, global financial volatility, disappointing global 
growth outcomes and geopolitical risks all capable of driving such an outcome. 
BRICs 
China 
We expect GDP to grow 7.0% in 2016O1, before the effect of policy easing in 
2015 start to peter out. With PBoC's focus shifting from the RMB-USD rate to a 
currency basket, we expect USDCNY to depreciate some 8% in 2016 and be 
around 7.0 at year end. We expect four RRR cuts and two benchmark interest 
cuts in 2016. 
India 
RBI's near term target of achieving 5.8% CPI inflation by early 2016, is likely to 
be met. But achieving the medium-term target of pushing inflation below 5% 
by early 2017 is going to be an uphill task given the various risks from fiscal, 
food supply, and services sector inflation, which probably will lead RBI to 
maintain a cautious stance. Consequently, we expect only one 25bps rate cut 
in 1H2016. 
The BCB has signaled that it will initiate another tightening cycle in order to 
make inflation converge to the 4.5% target in 2017, so we now expect a short 
cycle of 125bps starting with a 50bp hike in January.
