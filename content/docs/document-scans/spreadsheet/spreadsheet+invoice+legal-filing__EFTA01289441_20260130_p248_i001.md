Schedule of Realized Gains and Losses Current Period (continued) 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities may be adjusted for amortization, accretion, original issue discount adjustments, or principal paydowns. The calculation is based upon the taxpayer 
election, type of fixed income security. and certain attributes. obtained from sources believed to be reliable. In the event. one or more of these attributes is changed. there may be a temporary 
incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those 
involving foreign bonds. bonds sold short or bonds issued with lessthan one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the 
preparation of your tax returns.
