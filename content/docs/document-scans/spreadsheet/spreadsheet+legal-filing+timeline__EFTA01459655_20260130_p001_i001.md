1. What is happening in the oil market? 
Start with the basics. Global oil supply exceeds current consumption demand by 
about 1.5m barrels per day (b/d). Mostly, this reflects years of rising production, 
particularly by U.S. shale producers. Much of this boom was financed with debt, 
made easier by years of quantitative easing (OE) by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). 
Consumption has been growing too, but not as much. As a result, inventories are 
well above historic averages. Inventories will need to shrink sharply before oil prices 
can begin to rebound. 
Oil watchers have plenty to ponder as they try to figure out when this might happen. 
"This is a very fluid situation", Terry Brennan, Head of Commodities at Deutsche 
Asset Management (Deutsche AM) readily admits. We have revised our forecasts 
to an average of about $40/b for 2016. We expect prices to remain below that level 
during the first half of 2016, before recovering to $50 by year-end. 
There is plenty of uncertainty, however, ranging on the demand side from the winter 
weather in much of the northern hemisphere to fears of Chinese demand growth 
slowing. On the supply side, there is the return of Iran to the market and fears that, 
for once, growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran could lead to growing, 
rather than shrinking production. 
Already, it should be noted that other observers are more cautious when it comes to 
inventories. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (E.I.A.), for example, sees 
the global inventory build continuing for much of 2016, though at a slower rate. 
Unlike the D.A., we believe that inventories should begin to shrink in the second 
half of 2016 as shale producers may take out up to 1 mb/d of capacity.

' Note- Elora% from 78019 on 
Out of balance - for now 
The supplyI cansurnption chart. including 
forecasts from the U.S. 
shows that 
consumption has not been the issue in driving 
oil wises down. Demand has been growing 
steadily. This is expected to continue even 
as sources of growth shift. (/ulna's share. 
tor example, has already declined from 62% 
in 2011 to about a third in 201.53 Supply has 
seen an unusual phase of growth, driven by 
U S shale, and. more recently. by OPEC's 
output increase to currently 32mb/d. A 
positive balance means that inventories 
continue to grow.
