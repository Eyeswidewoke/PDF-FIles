Foundation in Liechtenstein in 1970. After briefly losing control of Pergamon Press Ltd (PPL) in the early 1970s (see Controversy below), in 1974 
he reacquired the company. Maxwell acquired the British Printing Corporation (BPC) in 1981, and changed its name to the British Printing and 
Communication Corporation (BPCC) and then to the Maxwell Communications Corporation. The company was later sold in a management buy-
out, and is now known as Polestar. In July 1984 Maxwell acquired Mirror Group Newspapers from Reed International plc. MGN published the 
Daily Mirror, a pro-Labour Party tabloid newspaper. He also bought the American interests of the Macmillan publishing house. 
By the 1980s Maxwell's various companies owned the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror, the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail and several 
other newspapers, Pergamon Press, Nimbus Records, Collier books, Maxwell Directories, Prentice Hall Information Services, Macmillan (US) 
publishing, and the Berlitz language schools. He also owned a half-share of MTV in Europe and other European television interests, Maxwell 
Cable TV and Maxwell Entertainment. In 1987 Maxwell purchased part of IPC Media to create Fleetway Publications. 
In June 1985, Maxwell announced a takeover of Sir Clive Sinclair's ailing home computer company, Sinclair Research, through Hollis Brothers, a 
Pergamon Press subsidiary.[11) However the deal was aborted in August 1985.[12) 
Maxwell's links with Eastern European totalitarian regimes resulted in a number of biographies (generally considered to be hagiographies[13)) of 
those countries' then leaders, with interviews conducted by Maxwell, for which he received much derision.[14) 
Maxwell was also well known as the chairman of Oxford United Football Club, saving them from bankruptcy and leading them into the top flight of 
English football, winning the League Cup in 1986. Maxwell bought into Derby County F.C. in 1987.
