IRR Analysis 
• An IRR or DCF analysis (mathematically equivalent) is an industry standard methodology for determining the value of a cash flow 
generating asset 
• For a start-up venture such as GB, there are significant assets that need to be acquired and/or developed in order for the business to 
function 
- If the costs for acquiring/developing these assets are captured by the cash flows then, those assets are not a part of what is being valued 
by the analysis. Specific examples include: 
• Satellites - captured through capital expenditures 
• Manufacturing facilities - captured through capital expenditures 
• Intellectual property - captured through NRE spend 
• Management talent - captured through the options pool and stock grants 
• Capital - captured through required rate of return / WACC 
- The valuation (or purchase price in the case of an IRR framework) resulting from the analysis needs to be allocated amongst all the 
assets whose costs are not captured in the cash flows 
• The only assets that aren't accounted for in the cash flows are the spectrum rights and landing rights 
• Landing rights in the Ku-band have historically been very easy to acquire and require nominal administrative fees
