Figures 18 and 19 compare our estimates vs. Consensus, with Figure 18 
shown on an ENI per unit basis, and Figure 19 shown on a distribution per unit 
basis (comparable to dividend per share forecasts, as Consensus DE forecasts 
are not readily available with a sizeable population). The Figures show our 
estimates for ENI are generally below Consensus, while our distribution 
forecasts are generally above Consensus. This above-Consensus view on 
distributions forms our more optimistic view on the Alt space - to the extent 
we are correct, and we think upside surprises in distributable earnings over the 
coming quarters will be a positive catalyst for valuation improvement.

Our valuation methodology 
While valuation methodologies using sum of the parts or DCF models can be 
intellectually rigorous, we think a more simplified PIE approach on distributable 
earnings (DE) will end up being a better indicator of the Ails' unit price 
performance over time. Our approach works in the following steps: 
• 
Observe each of the Alts forward P/E on Consensus (ENI) over the past 
12 months and last two years and compare to the S&P 500 to derive a 
relative PIE; 
• 
Assess to what extent each Alts' relative PIE will improve or worsen 
(or stay the same) over the next 12 months vs. the prior I2-months, 
based on the variety of fundamental factors outlined in this report; 
Derive a target forward P/E for the S&P 500 12 months from now, 
which is 14.9x (based on DB equity strategy forecast for S&P 2015 
EPS of $125 and S&P ending prices of 1850 yearend 2014 and 2000 
yearend 2015. which implies 1863 12-months from this report); 
• 
Multiply our target relative PIE to derive a target absolute PIE; 
Apply this absolute P/E on our 2015 DE forecasts to derive where the 
units will trade on 1-year forward distributable earnings 12-months 
from now; hence where the units will trade on 2015 DE in Jan-2015.
