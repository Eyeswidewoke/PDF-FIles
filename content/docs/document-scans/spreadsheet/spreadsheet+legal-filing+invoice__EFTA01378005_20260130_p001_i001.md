Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our historical combined financial 
statements and the related notes and the other financial Information Included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our historical combined financial statements have 
been prepared on a stand-alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of !AC. The combined financial 
statements reflect the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our businesses since their respective dates of acquisition by IAC and 
the allocation to us of certain IAC corporate expenses relating to us based on the historical finandal statements and accounting records of IAC. In the opinion 
of our management, the assumptions underlying our historical combined financial statements. including the basis on which the expenses have been allocated 
from SAC, are reasonable. However, the allocations may not reflect the expenses that we may have incurred as an independent, stand-alone company for the 
periods presented. For the purposes of our financial statements, income taxes have been computed for us on an as if stand-alone. separate tax return basis. 
Our historical results do not necessarily reflect whet our historical financial position and results of operations would have been had we been a stand-alone 
public company during the periods presented. In addition, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future 
period, and results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties Our actual results. performance and achievements could differ 
materially from those anticipated in these forward-fooling statements as a result of various factors, inducting those discussed below and elsewhere in this 
prospectus. particularly under "Risk factors.•
