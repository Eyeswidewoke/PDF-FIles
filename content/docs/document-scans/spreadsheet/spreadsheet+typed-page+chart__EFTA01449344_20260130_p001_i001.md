FX Blueprint: Dashing Buck 
outperformance precede dollar strength. The swing 
factor for a more pronounced dollar move, though, 
appears to be real interest rates. Their relentless 
decline since late 2008 did weigh on the dollar, but the 
picture has started to improve as real rates appear to 
be turning up (see first chart on this page). Earlier 
tapering by the Fed would likely cause a sharper move 
up in real yields, but even a further delay in tapering 
would unlikely cause real yields to reach new lows. 
Therefore, markets have entered an important new 
phase for the USD: real yields moving higher in tandem 
with stronger equity markets. Such a combination 
should be very supportive for the dollar. We therefore 
like to go long the dollar trade-weighted index. 
What about the euro 
We turned bearish EUR/USD at the beginning of 
March, and beyond our broad bullish dollar view we 
see two factors as driving us towards our 1.20 end-year 
target. First, we see divergence in conventional policy 
expectations 
(rates) 
returning. 
For 
all 
the 
unconventional measures since 2008, the remarkably 
consistent pricing of 2-year ahead rates paths from the 
Fed and ECB post Lehman is what stands out (see 
second chart). We think this year will mark the 
beginning of renewed divergence. On the Fed side, 
mid-2015 guidance is soon coming into view for 2-yr 
rates making the entire US yield curve "live". In 
contrast, the ECB is re-opening a discussion around 
negative rates and strengthening its verbal guidance on 
"low for long" via multi-year liquidity commitments. For 
how long can the market be pricing identical rates 
paths for the ECB and Fed over the next decade? 
Second, and more importantly, we see the reduction of 
Eurozone risk premix as negative, not positive for the 
EUR. On the one hand, our models suggest there is 
little redenomination risk priced into the EUR anymore. 
This has seen the correlation with Euro peripheral bond 
spreads and EUR/USD drop to close to zero, and makes 
the potential (negative) EUR/USD reaction to a return of 
tail risk very asymmetric. Most importantly, the big 
story over the last five years has not been a lack of 
inflows into the Euro-area, which have remained 
remarkably steady. It has been domestic risk aversion. 
This has seen large waves of repatriation and the 
building of more than EUR 1 trillion worth of under-
weights in foreign assets. Lower tail risks and a 
gradually improving business cycle should see a return 
of these outflows - so we think EUR/USD is fully 
capable of participating in a USD rally, even if it lags 
the move lower in many other crosses.
