removed. 8%. This puts the current episode's maximum decline of 11% in 
good company with historical episodes. But other aspects of the historical 
record suggest that we may not out of the woods yet. For one, previous 
episodes of shocks to the volatility risk premium tend to last substantially 
longer than two weeks; they take an average of 50 days, or 38 days if the 
crisis-era episodes are excluded. (While there are some previous examples of 
"short" vol shocks in early 2007 and October 2014, these might be more 
appropriately viewed as early warning indicators for more extended periods of 
high volatility, and less as standalone examples.) Also, the equity markets have 
tended to hit rock bottom during these episodes an average of 30 days or so 
after implied volatility rises. The S&P 500 hit its low just four days after the vol 
shock, which seems out of line with historical patterns.

The shock to the VIX index can be attributed to three inter-related measures of 
equity volatility: the general level of at-the-money volatility relative to the trend 
of realized volatility, the premium for options expiring in the near-term (1m) 
relative to somewhat longer-expiry (3m) options, as well as the premium for 
out-of-the-money strikes over at-the-money strikes. An additional way to 
measure the magnitude of last week's equity market shock is to consider the 
elevated level of volatility risk premium, measured here as the degree to which 
option-implied volatility exceeds realized volatility. Finally, it's worth observing 
that credit markets are also participating in these developments. The implied-
to-realized ratio on the CDX indices is also elevated, sitting in the 90th" 
percentile over the last 3.5 years for 1m options on IG CDX, while the equity 
risk premium is in the 99th percentile over the same period. 
ConG fusions 
Overall, we find market moves over the past week were in line with our 
expectations, directionally, although their speed, volatility, and reversals were 
certainly as much a surprise to us as they were to most other investors. We 
thought equities and other risk asset classes were much closer to what we 
perceive to be fair value at their bottom last Tuesday than they were following 
a retracement. Developments in China could have significant repercussions for 
broader EM universe, and we don't find EM credit spreads to be properly 
reflecting those consequences. We see main risks associated with EM credit 
assets being forced to re-price more substantially and having second-order 
effects on US credit markets. Additionally, historical evidence suggests that 
periods of extreme volatility similar to those witnessed over the past few 
sessions tend to exhibit propensity for aftershocks, usually lasting for weeks if 
not months.
