In single-As the market's fears at present are not being reflected in rating 
agencies outlooks or actions. None of the index single-A bonds are on negative 
watch at present. 
In BBBs the market's concerns are more justified with 50% of basic resource 
bonds and 30% of oil and gas bonds on negative watch. 42% of the BBB basic 
resource bonds are in the most obvious -danger zone" being BBB- rated and 
on negative watch with at least one of the major agencies. 
However even if we exclude these bonds we are still left with a good portion of 
the market which is trading with a fear of downgrade which isn't (so far) being 
reflected in actual rating agency concern. 
Second we can see what happened during the last major commodity crash in 
the heart of the global financial crisis. From June 2008 to February 2009 
commodity prices (as measured using the CRB index) fell 54%. Of those bonds 
that were in the EUR IG iBoxx index in June 2008 7% of the basic resource and 
8% of the oil and gas bonds were downgraded to a lower band by the time 
commodity prices reached their trough. During the current sell-off (since June 
2014) where commodity prices have fallen by around 40% we have seen 4% of 
the basic resource bonds and 23% of the oil and gas IG bonds downgraded to 
a lower band (Figure 27). So whilst there is room for further downgrades in the 
basic resource sector it is interesting to note that in the 2008-2009 period 
where prices fell much more in percentage terms although to similar levels 
seen today, and with a major global financial crisis on top we didn't see major 
swathes of the commodity market being downgraded. The past is never a 
perfect guide to the present, however it does provide us some comfort that the 
whole sector is not automatically about to be downgraded on mass in the face 
of current commodity price weakness. 
Potential Value 
Given how commodity bond ratings held up pretty well in 2008-2009 the case 
for value in the commodity sector appears stronger. 
We focus on single-As and BBBs as this seems to be where the most obvious 
commodity bond value seems to exist vs. the rest of the market. Also we 
exclude those bonds most at risk of falling a rating band (those rated A-/BBB-
and on negative watch). We rerun our earlier analysis looking at how 
commodity bonds are trading vs. their respective rating bands accounting for 
these criteria in Figure 28 and Figure 29. It is clear that a number of these 
better rated commodity bonds are still trading very wide vs. the rest of the 
market. The market seems to be pricing many single-A and BBB commodity 
bonds as if they are the same during the current commodity volatility. The
