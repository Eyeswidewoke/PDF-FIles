CIS: Commonwealth of Independent States 
Another Substantial Driver of the Global Supply Imbalance 
CIS encompasses Russia and several adjacent nations following the dissolution 
of the Soviet Union in 1991. During 2016 CIS manufactured 102.4mn mt of 
steel and consumed 54.7mn mt resulting in a sizeable regional surplus of 
47.7mn mt, albeit less than Asia's 63.5mn mt of excess production. We have 
bifurcated CIS into two sub-sectors below to better analyze the underlying data. 
▪ 
Russia manufactured 70.8mn mt of crude steel against apparent demand 
of 42.4mn mt resulting in a national steel surplus of 28.4mn metric tonnes. 
e 
CIS (ex-Russia) manufactured 31.6mn mt of crude steel against apparent 
demand of 123mn mt resulting in 19.3mn mt of additional steel.

Currencies in the countries that encompass the developing markets of CIS are 
characteristically weaker (e.g. Russian Ruble) providing CIS with a competitive 
advantage over competing countries with stronger currencies (e.g. the United 
States). This is particularly true with respect to the scrap steel trade, whereby 
a strengthening U.S. dollar typically results in lower U.S. exports of scrap metal 
and, alternatively, a weaker U.S. dollar where U.S. scrap exports become more 
attractive to leading scrap importers such as Turkey. 
South America (SA) 
SA steel production was 40.2mn mt versus apparent demand of 40.6mn mt in 
2016 resulting in a deficit of -400K mtpa. Brazil is the largest producer in SA, 
manufacturing 31.3mn mt of steel in 2016 versus consumption of 20.2mn mt.
