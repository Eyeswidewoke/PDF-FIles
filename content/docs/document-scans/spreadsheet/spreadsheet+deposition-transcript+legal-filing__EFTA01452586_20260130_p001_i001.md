Figures 20-22 shows the results of this valuation analysis. Figure 20 shows the 
absolute and relative forward P/Es (on next 12 months forecast EPS) 
historically over the last 12 months and last two years for the each of the Alts, 
as well as for the S&P 500 and the median traditional asset manager (15 
largest publicly traded asset management stocks). It also shows the current 
P/E on 2014 ENI Consensus estimates. We then assign target premiums or 
discounts for each of the Alts vs. their relative P/Es over the last 12 months to 
derive our target relative P/Es (the last two columns of Figure 20).

Figure 21 converts these target relative P/Es into absolute P/Es and price 
targets. The valuation analysis in both tables show that we expect the Alts to 
trade at median P/E of 12-13x on 2015 DE, a year from now - which implies 
achieving a relative PE of -85% of the S&P 500, or said differently, a 15% 
discount to the S&P 500 PIE - vs. their current discount of 30% (i.e. the 69% 
value shown in Figure 20). Compared with the traditional asset managers, this 
implies improving the Alts' P/E discount to traditional managers to about 23%, 
given the traditional are currently trading at a 7% premium to the S&P 500 vs. 
our 26% forecast discount for the Alts. However, this implies a static relative 
PIE for the traditional asset managers, which may not be the case (though the 
asset managers had modest relative P/E contraction over the last two years.
