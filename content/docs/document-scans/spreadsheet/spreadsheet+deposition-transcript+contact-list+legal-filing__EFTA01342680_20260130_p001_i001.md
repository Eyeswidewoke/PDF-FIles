Interpreting Call Detail Records 
Your response includes Call Detail Records (CDR) either with or without location. Our query results in an Excel file with multiple 
columns. This is a combined report of calls and messages. Each row represents one call on the T-Mobile network. Some fields only 
appear in reportswith location information. T-Mobile does not retain the content of text messages. 
Calls made while roaming also do not appear on this report. 
Entries with outgoing calls to 8056377249 indicate incoming calls that are forwarded (out) to the voicemail system. Entries with 
outgoing calls to 8056377243 = 805-MESSAGE indicate voicemail retrieval. 
Please remember that T-Mobile CDR systems natively use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). By default, that means a day of call 
detail records are taken from 00:00:01 to 23:59:59 UTC which may differ from your intended time range due to your time zone. If 
specific times other than our default are important to your inquiry, please submit legal demands with the date range/time frame 
adjusted for UTC to avoid delay or confusion. We are unable to convert the time displayed in the records to the local time of the 
handset. 
The columns present on your CDR may be:
