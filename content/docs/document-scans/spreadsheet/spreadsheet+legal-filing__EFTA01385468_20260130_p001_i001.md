The Middle East & Africa 
Similar to Oceania. the Middle East and Africa account for small percentages 
of global supply and demand. Both appear to import the majority of their steel 
needs from geographies with excess crude steel production, like China and CIS.

• 
The Middle East produced 31.5mn mt of steel versus apparent demand of 
57.7mn mt resulting in a 2016 steel deficit of 26.2mn metric tonnes. 
• 
Africa manufactured 13.1mn mt of steel compared to apparent demand of 
40.9mn mt resulting in a 27.7mn mt steel deficit in 2016. 
Key Takeaways 
Having now analyzed the steel trade on both a regional and country-specific 
basis, we have identified a few key themes to keep in mind when considering 
trends in the global steel markets: 
• 
The global steel industry is characteristically oversupplied largely due to 
production in excess of demand primarily emanating from Asia and CIS; 
• 
While steel is not a "true" commodity but rather an alloy, it trades globally 
like a commodity meaning that differences in quality are largely negligible 
for most of the generic products (hot-rolled coil, cold-rolled coil); 
• 
According to our analysis, nations that appear responsible for producing 
more steel than demand warrants in their countries include China, Japan, 
South Korea, Russia and several other former Soviet countries in the CIS; 
• 
Disparities in global steel prices bring about an arbitrage opportunity for 
countries able and willing to ship steel to healthier markets with superior 
pricing than their own domestic market; 
• 
NA and the EU have become target markets to dump excess steel and are 
now focused on combating incoming imports by way of tariffs and duties; 
• 
Turkey is the largest importer of scrap steel globally while the U.S. is the 
largest exporter; Turkey has historically imported one-third of U.S. scrap 
exports, hence directionally investors should look to trends in Turkey to 
analyze the supply / demand balance in the global scrap steel trade; and, 
• 
Steel prices in a given market reflect regional relationships between supply 
and demand and may differ meaningfully from market to market.
