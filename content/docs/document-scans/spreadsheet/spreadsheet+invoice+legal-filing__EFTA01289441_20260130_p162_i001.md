incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those 
involving foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with less t hen one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the
