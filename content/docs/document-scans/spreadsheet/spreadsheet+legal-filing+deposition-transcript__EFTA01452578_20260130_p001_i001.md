Alternative Assot Manager Initiation 
Fee-based revenue, mostly as a portion of fee-based assets under 
management (FPAuM) but also from a variety of transaction fees, accounts for 
40% of the revenue while principal investing (proprietary investments on 
balance sheet, mostly alongside limited partners (LPs) in the funds), makes up 
over 10%. Over the past several years (and to some extent over past couple 
decades), the Alts have increasingly attempted to diversify their businesses 
into other tangential areas to private equity, usually leveraging capabilities in 
private equity but also to tap into new growth areas, most of which have a 
greater fee-based nature. We expect this trend to continue, and to help bolster 
valuations over time, although the cyclicality of mark-to-market based carry 
revenue may dwarf the growth in fee revenue over prolonged periods. 
AuM organic growth likely to remain good despite oncoming realization cycle 
In figure 8, we show a variety of metrics around assets under management 
(AuM) and fee-paying assets under mgmt (FPAuM). Given the revenue model 
of private equity is oriented toward the more lucrative carried interest (i.e. the 
20% of total net investment return the general partner receives, usually after 
passing about an 8% annual return hurdle), the AuM metrics are less 
meaningful vs. traditional asset managers, particularly as the FPAuM is usually 
based on committed capital (before investment returns). Hence vs. a traditional 
asset manager, the Alts get a better revenue participation of their investment 
returns vs. just fees on AuM. Still, the Ails' AuM growth profiles are important, 
and we see relatively good organic growth and fundraising trends as essential 
in commanding better P/Es over the long-term. 
Overall, Figure 8 shows a fairly choppy organic growth profile across the group, 
which can be more influenced by the pace of realizations and shifts between 
AuM and FPAuM. Still, the table shows BX, followed by CG as the largest by 
AuM and also most diversified across businesses, with BX and CG being 
leaders in private equity from AuM perspective, OAK the largest in credit, 
followed closely by BX and APO, and BX by far the largest in real estate - an 
asset class that is a differentiating aspect for BX vs. peers in terms of business 
mix.
