"dirty" relent, which is to keep October and December FOMC dates in play. In 
this case 2s55 could steepen slightly but such a move would be short lived and 
limited in magnitude, if not for a hyped expectation of an October liftoff it 
would be because China's FX intervention flows continue to exert a flattening 
pressure on the curve, which we discussed earlier in this note.

Risk/reward shifting towards paying front end spreads 
Front end spread tightening has been considerable given concerns about 
possible intervention-related selling, and has reached levels we think offer 
value. At the time of writing the most recent Chinese reserves data have not 
been released, and markets will naturally be looking for concrete evidence that 
intervention-related sales have indeed been material. While this may introduce 
event risk into paid positions in spreads. we think risk reward should be biased 
toward spread re-widening from current levels. 
There are three primary supporting arguments. The first is that China will be 
increasingly defensive of its reserves, and is more likely to devalue in a larger 
increment to discourage new speculation against the RMB and trap 
speculative capital. A large enough increment should significantly reduce 
further speculation on the margin and hence reduce the need to liquidate 
Treasury positions to sell dollars and buy domestic currency. 
The second is that there remains some possibility that if the Fed does indeed 
raise rates (which we think would increase the probability of further 
devaluation in a lumpy increment) that IOER will have to be set higher than the 
top of the desired band for overnight effective funds in order to create 
adequate incentive for banks to do the "arb" whereby they absorb cash 
balances in the overnight market and then deposit them at the Fed. Third, 
both a devaluation and the likely risk-off market environment that would 
accompany it should bias spreads wider. 
If, as remains our central expectation, the Fed does not raise rates. then we 
would expect speculative pressure against the RMB to decrease somewhat, 
slowing reserve loss and Treasury liquidation. So even though diminished 
financial stress might work against spreads in this scenario, intervention-
related selling could well decline. 
Financing is obviously critical with front end spreads, and this trade is 
complicated somewhat by high term repo rates relative to LIBOR.

September 2y note, given current levels, is likely to a reopening of the
