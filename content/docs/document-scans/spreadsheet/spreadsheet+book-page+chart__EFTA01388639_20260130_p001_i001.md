CBDs. Softening fundamentals in downtown submarkets have not deterred investors: we estimate that the average 
going in cap rate for urban core product remains at 4.5% in our 26 investable markets, with many prime assets 
trading under 4.0%.4$ The lofty prices investors are willing to pay for CBD assets helps explain why developers 
continue to build downtown despite softening fundamentals. These neighborhoods are potentially at risk of further 
supply build-up in the outer years of our forecast If pricing does not adjust. 
NPI total returns for the apartment sector slowed to 10.9% (trailing four quarters) in the first quarter 2016 from 
12.0% as of late 2015.s, Western metros have been the primary outperformers: Oakland. Denver, Portland, 
Riverside, San Jose, San Francisco and Orange County all exhibited total returns of 16% or more over the past 
year. In contrast, several slower growth Midwest and East Coast markets. along with Houston, made up a majority 
of the underperformers with total returns in the single digits. Among apartment property subtypes, garden 
apartments were the top performers, returning 13.9% over the last year. Despite their popularity with investors. 
high-rise properties lagged behind, returning 9.3%, 200 basis points below the subtype's 5-year average 
annualized return. 
7.2 Outlook and Strategy 
While favorable macro trends should continue to sustain healthy renter demand, it is unlikely to offset the expected 
flood of new supply. New deliveries are projected to average 234,000 units per year from 2016 to 2018 — 74% 
above their long-term annual average of 137,000 unitsP Still-healthy net absorption will likely not keep pace and 
as a result, vacancies are forecasted to increase. Upward pressure on vacancy is projected to cause rent growth to 
moderate. As many major coastal markets exhibit decelerating rent growth, late-recovery Sunbelt markets are 
expected to take the lead. By the later years of the forecast, continued deliveries, competition with home-buying 
and moderating payroll expansion will likely push vacancy above historic averages to the upper 5% range and 
cause rent growth to slip below 2% per year (see Exhibit 15).

Slowing rent growth and rising vacancy, combined with very low yields, will likely limit apartments' ability to produce 
strong total returns relative to the other main properly types. Given that many prime apartment markets are fully 
valued, attractive investment opportunities have become more limited, putting a premium on patience and 
selectivity when acquiring assets. Although we believe the prime markets should be viewed as strategic long-term 
performers, elevated pricing in these locations will likely constrain total returns in the near term.
