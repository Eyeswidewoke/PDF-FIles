Amendment No. 3 to Form S-I 
Table of Conte ti 
presented summary historical consolidated financial information on a combined basis as the mathematical addition or the Predecessor and 
Successor periods. We believe that the presentation with mathematical addition provides meaningful information about our results of 
operations on a period to period basis. This approach is not consistent with GAAP, may yield results that arc not strictly comparable on a 
period to period basis and may not reflect the actual results we would have achieved. 
The data set forth in the following table should be read together with the sections of this prospectus entitled "Use of Proceeds," 
"Capitalization," "Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations" and "Business" and in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included 
elsewhere in this prospectus.
