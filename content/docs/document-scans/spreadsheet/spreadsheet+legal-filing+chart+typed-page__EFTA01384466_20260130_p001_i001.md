Long-Term Asset Return Study: The Next Financial Crisis 
at them by turning on the monetary and fiscal spigots which have arguably 
allowed each crisis to be solved but only via an increase in global debt and 
pushing the problem on to someone else in the future. 
In terms of demographics, the working age share of the population troughed at 
the end of the 1970s in the large DM economies and we have seen a surge of 
workers since (Figure 30). At the same time China coincidently decided to 
integrate itself into the global economy for the first time in many centuries. The 
net impact of both these trends was to massively depress DM wage inflation 
right up to the current day (Figure 29). In turn this helped ensure that inflation 
was on a naturally downward path over the past 35 years and thus allowing 
policy makers to aggressively intervene whenever any problems arose in the 
financial system or global economy. The lack of inflation pressure encouraged 
intervention rather than creative destruction. This in turn increasingly allowed 
more and more excess to build up in the system as each crisis ended with the 
stock of global debt higher relative to output than before it struck.

Had inflation not been controlled by external factors it's debatable whether 
central banks and governments would have had the same freedom to oil the 
wheels of excess over the past few decades. So whilst we have laid a large 
amount of blame for a higher frequency of crises on the collapse of precious 
metal currency systems. the reality is that a huge surge in the labour force also 
encouraged the highly unstable environment. 
We would stress that the last 45 years has seen tremendous asset price 
growth, especially in nominal terms, so this is not to say that the period has 
been a struggle for investors. It's more that finance has generally been more 
prone to crisis and the eventual intervention and liquidity has led to large asset 
price inflation across the board and led to an increased likelihood of 
subsequent crises that also need to be solved thus creating a vicious cycle (or 
virtuous circle depending on your view) of crises and booms. 
kV:fie not advocating a return to the God Staiidard r Bretton 
Syszem 
In reading this note readers could be forgiven for thinking we are advocating a 
return to a Gold Standard or something resembling the Bretton Woods system. 
However this is not the case as a return to such a rigid system today would be 
a disastrous, if understandable reaction to the excesses of the last 45 years. 
The savage economic hardship of the 1930s, especially for those that stuck to 
the Gold Standard for too long, and the extreme difficulties that the Euro 
peripheral countries have experienced post the GFC highlights that economic 
and policy rigidity are a potential nightmare for nations in need of a big 
adjustment or outside help.
