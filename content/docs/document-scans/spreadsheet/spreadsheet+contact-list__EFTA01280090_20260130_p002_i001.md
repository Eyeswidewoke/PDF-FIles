Examples of Home Loan Amortization Schedules 
Examples of amonization schedules arc shown for four different home loans of $150.000 on the charts below. These examples permit you, for example. to compare 
how a higher interest rate will affect your periodic payment and the differences between conventional 15-year and 30-year fixed rate home loans. These examples 
assume that monthly payments arc made on the scheduled due dates. Your lender may be required under North Carolina law to deliver at your loan closing. or mail 
to you within three days thereafter, an amortization schedule for your loan. These examples arc for informational purposes only, and the amortization schedule for 
your loan may differ based on the terms of your home loan. In addition, your actual required periodic payments may be higher than these examples if your lender 
uses a different interest calculation method. requires you to make periodic escrow payments for insurance and/or taxes, or you owe late charges.
