The limits of monetary policy 
.6.,r4Tgat Edir,r,j ?fore, 
For OE to have much of an impact, you need to create somewhat ad-hoc 
assumptions. Translated into plain English, this means coming up with stories 
for why private investors will not fully adjust their portfolios to reflect recent and 
anticipate future actions by the central bank. Generally, such stories boil down to 
different assets not being perfect substitutes for different types of investors. 
Insurance companies or pension funds, say, might face regulatory restrictions on 
which assets they can hold. There might be differential information and transaction 
costs for retail investors. Some investors might invest in certain ways simply out of 
habit. All of which might be true, but ideally, you would want to have a lot more data 
before betting economies worth trillions of dollars on it. To his credit, Ben Bernanke, 
the Fed's chair throughout much of the crisis, has freely acknowledged as much in 
speeches and in his earlier academic work! 
We would argue that part of the reason the Fed was relatively successful with this 
policy, was markets were ready - indeed eager - to play along. It is less clear that 
OE will be as helpful going forward, either in the United States or elsewhere. As the 
balance sheets of central banks have ballooned, private-sector debts have also been 
mounting, from emerging markets borrowers to U.S. corporates. In the search for 
yield, some of the money that actually did find its way into lending will inevitably 
turn out to have been misspent ... perhaps sowing the seeds of the next crisis. 
Despite monetary easing. Eurozone lending remains subdued

Lending never really recovered from 
the crisis 
Despite all the efforts by the ECEL loans to 
the business sector of the Eurozone remain 
weak In part, tit probably reflects the fact 
that troubled banks, especially in Southern 
Europe, are not fully transmitting monetary 
loosening to their clients. A bigger problem is 
probably demand for business loans remains 
weak, reflecting subdued growth in several 
Eurozone economies. Loans to households 
are slowly rising. Overall, however. CIE has not 
proven very effective in improving tending
