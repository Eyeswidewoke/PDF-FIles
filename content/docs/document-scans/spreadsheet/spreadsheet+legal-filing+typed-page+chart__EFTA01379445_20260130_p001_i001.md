2. EM FX valuations are still attractive 
According to our preferred DBeer model (which models 
FX as a function of inflation, terms of trade and 
productivity) EM r< is 
needy 
urid,,,Norued in 
aggregate (chart). The overall undervaluation of EM 
currencies despite their appreciation relative to the 
USD reflects EM FX's loss of ground relative to the 
EUR (and other GI0 currencies). Accordingly, on a 
trade-weighted basis (which underpins valuation 
estimations) the rally has been limited this year. More 
importantly, periods of significant undervaluation tend 
to be corrected amidst higher EM growth and more 
restrictive monetary conditions - both of which we 
expect will be in place next year as real rates also seem 
to have bottomed in EM. 
EM EX is still significantly undervalued

In addition, USD strength and hedging demand feeil 
unlikely to disrupt EM FX revaluation. DB foresees 
EUR/USD at 1.20 in 2018 and higher in 2019. If 
anything, more synchronized and faster growth 
Page 4 
reduces policy imbalances (supporting ECB catch-up), 
which has been associated with EUR strength (chart). 
Absent USD strength, FX-hedging demand should 
remain subdued as long as US inflation is contained - a 
risk likely to increase later in the year, however. 
The USD could still be supportive in 2013

Which specific; DNA currencies stand out? 
With valuation and growth/flows as the main tailwinds 
but facing rising core yields, we favour currencies 
where these tailwinds are stronger and those that score 
higher on defensive metrics (i.e. are better able to 
withstand rising core yields). 
'Defensive' longs 
The main macro headwind we foresee is tightening 
iirei;rh”; 
or:ncle;ans on ECB tapering and Fed's 
divestment (amid increased supply on fiscal easing). 
Also, with less room to maneuver the risk of policy 
mistakes is higher and volatility tends to increase as 
liquidity tightens. In our view, as long as inflation 
pressures are limited, sudden stops are unlikely and

Still we prefer EM currencies that are better able to 
withstand shocks and perform even in more difficult 
external environments. 
Ow 'defensive' ranking is based on three 'defensive' 
dimensions - real rates. FX reserves and current 
accountibasie balance fbt.-::.; As the chart below shows, 
THB, RUB and BM. have among the best scores in our 
'defensive' ranking These are among our preferred EM 
longs for 2018. We are also bullish on 1St,'" - while it is 
in the middle of the pack on our 'defensive' rankings, 
its robust external balances provide strong butters, in 
our view.
