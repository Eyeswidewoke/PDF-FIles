SECTION 5.K.(2) Separately Managed Accounts - Use of Borrowingsand Derivatives 
r No information is required to be reported in this Section 5.K.(2) per the instructions of this Section 5.K.(2) 
If your regulatory assets under management attributable to separately managed accounts are at least $10 billion, you should complete Question (a). If your 
regulatory assets under management attributable to separately managed accounts are at least $500 million but less than $10 billion, you should complete 
Question (b). 
(a) In the table below, provide the following information regarding the separately managed accounts you advise. If you are a subadviser to a separately 
managed account, you should only provide information with respect to the portion of the account that you subadvise. End of year refers to the date 
used to calculate your regulatory assets under management for purposes of your annual updating amendment. Mid-year is the date six months before 
the end of year date. 
In column 1, indicate the regulatory assets under management attributable to separately managed accounts associated with each level of gross 
notional exposure. For purposes of this table, the gross notional exposure of an account is the percentage obtained by dividing (i) the sum of (a) the 
dollar amount of any borrowings and (b) the gross notional value of all derivatives, by (ii) the regulatory assets under management of the account. 
In column 2, provide the dollar amount of borrowings for the accounts included in column 1. 
In column 3, provide aggregate gross notional value of derivatives divided by the aggregate regulatory assets under management of the accounts 
included in column 1 with respect to each category of derivatives specified in 3(a) through (f). 
You may, but are not required to, complete the table with respect to any separately managed account with regulatory assets under management of less 
than $10,000,000. 
Any regulatory assets under management reported in Item S.D.(3)(d), (e), and (f) should not be reported below.
