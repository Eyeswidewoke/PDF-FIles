FX Blueprint: Forever Young 
Theme #9: Asian provocateur Buy USD vs TVVD, KRW and THB 
Investors should diversity their focus from external 
vulnerabilities in EM (current account deficits, reserves, 
foreign ownership) to include internal vulnerabilities 
(output gaps, domestic indebtedness). As the fed hikes, 
rate differentials will narrow more in internally 
vulnerable EM markets. THB, 7WD, KRW & CNY stand 
out as the shorts to capture this theme in Asia. 
For global FX investors, Asia has arguably been a place 
to hide in recent years. On average, current account 
positions in Asia are healthier; the beta to the USD has 
been significantly lower; and FX volatility much lesser 
than other regions (Chart 1. top half). Admittedly, there 
is large infra-Asian heterogeneity, with the likes of 
Malaysia and Indonesia hardly subscribing to these 
favorable characteristics. But on average, Asian 
currencies can be said to have been less externally 
vu€nerable than her EM and even G10 peers. 
However, when shifting focus to internal vulnerabilities

for Asia. The slowdown in growth in Asia, measured by 
the 10 year z-score of 2016 growth forecasts, is second 
worst to Latin America. Importantly though, unlike 
Latam, where central banks are still expected to hike 
rates along with the Fed this year, Asian central banks 
remain biased to ease further (Chart 1, bottom half). 
Asia is the only region where policy rates on average 
will be coming down. This will be led by cuts in China, 
Indonesia, and India, but with the risk that other 
economies performing below potential also feel 
compelled to ease Interestingly, the performance of 
average Asian HEEHs has 
tracked 
the growth 
'advantage' of Asia over developed markets very tightly 
in the past (Chart 2). The recent correction in Asian 
REERs is consistent with a 'catch-down' to the 
narrower gap between Asian and DM growth, as Asia 
has slowed and developed markets picked up some 
pace. But, the Asian FX adjustment appears incomplete, 
with room for more weakness before the slower 
growth reality is fully priced in.

ownership of domestic securities, USD denominated 
external debt, commodity exposure. and reserves 
coverage, amongst others. Indeed, these have been the 
differentiating metrics for EM FX for the past few years. 
In Asia. the two currencies which show up on the rear 
end of these metrics are Indonesia and Malaysia. 
Reserves coverage for short-term external debt is the 
poorest (Chart 3), foreign ownership of local currency 
government bonds the highest at 39% and 47% 
respectively, and current accounts are most exposed to 
lower energy prices. These vulnerabilities will keep IDR 
and MYR most liable to weaken during times of risk 
!External vs. internal vulnerabilities: Asia scores highly 
ion the former, but increasingly poorly on the latter
