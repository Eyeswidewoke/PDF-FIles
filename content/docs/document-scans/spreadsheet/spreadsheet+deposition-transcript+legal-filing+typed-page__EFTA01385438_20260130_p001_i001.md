Retail foot traffic has improved recently, though remains negative 
Retail foot traffic in North America, while still negative, has shown en 
acceleration recently, according to Prodco. Shopper visit data for brick-and-
mortar retail stores on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday declined a combined 
1.6% when compared to the same days in 2016, according to ShopperTrak. 
Black Friday 2017 shopper visits decreased less than 1.0% when compared to 
Black Friday 2016. This compared to 2016 in which shopper visits declined 
1.0% over the two day period and were flat on Black Friday. We expect the 
Black Friday comparison benefited from a greater number of brick-and-mortar 
retailers opting to close on Thanksgiving Day.
