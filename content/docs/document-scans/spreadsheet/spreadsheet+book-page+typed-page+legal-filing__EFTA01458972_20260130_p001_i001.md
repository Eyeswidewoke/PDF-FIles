World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Asia (ex Japan): Triple troubles 
At first glance, Asia's ongoing economic slowdown could be explained away in 
cyclical terms that could bottom next year. After all, the hangover from the 
global financial crisis of 2008-09 persists and global economic recovery is 
uneven. With appropriate policy support, the recovery could gain strength, and 
it appears that 2016 may well be the year of strong fiscal spending in many 
parts of the world. The recent commodity bust may turn out to be temporary, 
with only short-lived impact on investment. G2 economies could continue to 
get stronger and re-emerge as a source of vigorous exports demand for Asia. 
China's cyclical measures to deal with overcapacity and financial system stress 
could pave the way for healthier growth. 
Even if some of these favorable developments were to transpire, Asia may find 
the economic environment in 2016 and 2017 to be about the same as the last 
couple of years. There may be further slowing of China, but India and 
Indonesia could see growth accelerate, Malaysia and the Philippines could 
maintain trend growth, and the rest of Asia could see less disappointment. 
Indeed, our forecast for the next two years assumes such a path. We see 
China settling at sub-7% growth in an orderly manner, while by 2017 India's 
growth should head past 7.5% and Indonesia should go back to 5%. 2-3% 
growth may be the norm for many other Asian economies, but given the 
challenging nature of the cycle, that ought to be an acceptable outturn. The 
key assumption in these forecasts is that financial sector risks are managed 
and economic spillovers from a slowing China are contained. 
But there are some major fault lines in this somewhat innocuous narrative. 
Deeper examination of the region's economic dynamic however reveals a 
series of headwinds that transcend the cycle. In this piece, we go over three 
key headwinds — aging, stagnant trade, and rising debt - that could get in the 
way of growth and prosperity in the coming years. There are enough savings 
and safeguards in place in the region to mitigate risks of an outright crisis 
owing to these headwinds; a more likely scenario however is a gradual erosion 
of potential GDP growth rate, worsening of public finances, and a general 
decline in sentiment about the region's prospects. 
Aging 
Considerable attention has been paid in recent years to China's rapid aging. 
Indeed, recent news on the relaxation of the long-standing one-child policy 
reflects the seriousness with which the Chinese authorities are considering the 
aging problem. Beyond China, a number of Asian Tiger economies are 
undergoing an aging process that will last decades. Aging is problematic ior 
variety of reasons. As the number of elderly rises, the labor force shrinks, 
reducing not just the availability of workers but also the output, incomes, and 
taxes generated by those workers. As a result, potential GDP growth declines, 
the fiscal position worsens (as transfers to dependents rise and tax collection 
from the shrinking pool of workers declines), and overall economic vitality 
dissipates. The decline in potential GDP growth along with a rise in the share 
of dependents also has adverse implications for savings, debt sustainability, 
and financial markets. 
Can't public policy arrest this problem? While we welcome China's latest 
initiative, we find that aging is very difficult to reverse. Singapore is a case in 
point. Faced with declining fertility and the prospect of rapid aging, the 
authorities have introduced wide-ranging measures to encourage families to 
have more children. These measures include longer leave for parents, tax 
incentives, and a more generous social safety net. But so far, the track record
