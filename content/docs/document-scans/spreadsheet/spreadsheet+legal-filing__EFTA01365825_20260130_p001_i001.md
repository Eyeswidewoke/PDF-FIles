Amendment No. 3 to Form S-I 
Table of Content, 
As a percentage of Brazil restaurant revenue, Brazil contribution margin decreased 3.2% from 37.3% to 34.1%. due to 1.6% increase in 
compensation and benefits costs due to inflation in hourly wages, a 0.9% increase; in food and beverage costs due to commodity increases and a 
0.8% increase in occupancy and other operating costs due to new stores, all partially offset by leverage on higher average check at our comparable 
restaurants. 
Unaudited Quarterly Statements of Operations 
The following tables present our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended March 29, 2015 and for each of the eight 
fiscal quarters in the period ended December 28, 2014. You should read the following tables in conjunction with our audited and unaudited 
consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this prospectus. We have prepared the unaudited financial information 
on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements and have included all adjustments. consisting of normal recurring 
adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to fairly present our operating results for the quarters presented. Our historical 
unaudited quarterly results of operations arc not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarter or for a full year. 
Our quarterly results of operations have historically varied due to a variety of factors. including the timing of new restaurant openings and 
related expenses, profitability of new restaurants, weather, increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales, foreign exchange fluctuations. 
general economic conditions, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in consumer preferences. competitive factors, changes in food costs. 
changes in labor costs and rising gas prices. In the past. we have experienced significant variability in restaurant pre-opening costs from quarter to 
quarter primarily due to the timing of restaurant openings. Accordingly. the number and timing of new restaurant openings in any quarter has had, 
and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on quarterly restaurant pre-opening cogs, labor and direct operating and occupancy costs. 
As such, we believe that comparisons of our quarterly results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.
