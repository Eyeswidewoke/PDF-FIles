Keep It 
Simple 
The mantra for captains and managers when it 
comes to superyacht accounting is little and often, 
but even then, difficulties arise. Don Hoyt Gorman 
investigates some of the latest superyacht-specific 
software solutions available on the market today.

lking the docks at Fort Lauderdale in 
012. Dasha Grupman might very easily 
have been intimidated by the prevalence of 
industry fat-cats and surly sailors amidst the 
tens of thousands of show visitors who picked 
their way through the hurricane.soaked event. 
But Grupman was determined. She's spent the 
better part of four years developing a tool that 
could help the industry, and she quickly booked 
meetings with some of the show's key figures. 
Gruptnatt's software — previously known 
as Expense Stewanl and now known as 
Latitude365 - aims to solve the significant 
accounting headaches that captains face 
essentially every day: tracking receipts and 
invoices, and submitting expenses for approval. 
providing historical reports to show how the 
costs of various departments (engine room, 
galley. housekeeping) have fluctuated over the 
season or over years. 
Grupman has an MBA from Fordham and, prior 
to stepping into the superyacht sector, had been 
managing a handful of residential estates fur 
JP Bailey. "1 was doing the accounting for these 
homes, and was getting reports from the people 
managing those homes. who had no accounting 
education and who barely knew Excel." 
Grupman explained. "So every month, it was a 
big headache." Shc looked for software to make 
it easier, but they were all too complicated and 
time-consuming for these managers to learn. 
To make her own life easier, she partnered 
with software developer Uli Graser, who had 
previously developed property management 
and accounting solutions, medical billing 
software (EMR), invoicing systems, 
maintenance management software, customer 
relationship management (CRM), and several 
other database management systems. Together. 
over two yea's. they built a deceptively simple 
program, based on the robust architecture 
of the commercially available FileMakerPro 
software. Starting in the summer of 2009. they 
developed their first trial version by 2010 and 
quickly began proposing its use for other home 
office accountants through their network of 
contacts. By 2011, they'd met a client who also 
had a yacht and wanted to use the software to 
account for the vessel's expenses. Grupman 
said that she has shown latitude to most of the 
major management companies and has free 
trials out with about 10 captains. 
With the ability to export all its data to Excel, 
the system works relatively well in conjunction 
with a home office or management company's 
existing systems. "We're focusing on private 
vessels for the time being, though we've had 
meetings with a number of managements 
companies; Grupman said. "On commercial 
vessels, management tends to dictate the 
accounting software, and so we're hoping we 
can persuade one of the companies to give us 
a try." 
I'd seen Grupman's pitch and started to 
wonder about die problem of accounting for 
superyachts. lier product clearly seemed to be 
filling a perceived need. After all. I presumed
