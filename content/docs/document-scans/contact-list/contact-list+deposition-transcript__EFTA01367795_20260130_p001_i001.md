US Equity Insights 
It's time to buy the Big & Low 25 stock basket again as Energy 
names tall out 
The 25 stocks that most lower the S&P PE are attractive again. These stocks have big 
market cap and earnings weights and trade at low PEs vs. the S&P. These 25 stocks 
are: 9 Financials (JPM, C, WFC, BAC, GS, MET, PRU, AIG, COF), 8 Tech (AAPL, IBM, 
HPO, CSCO, MU, QCOM, INTC, ORCL), 2 Airlines (AAL, DAL), 2 Telecom (VZ, T), 2 
Autos (GM, F), 1 Health Care (GILD), and 1 Energy (VLO). The aggregate PE on 2015 
EPS of these 25 stocks is 12 vs. 20x for the S&P excluding them. We see value at 
Telecom, but return it to EW from the OW set Jan end and put Media/Cable back to EW 
rom UW. We OW Heath Care, Tech, Financials and Utilities. We UW Energy, 
Industrials and Materials.
