Single Supervisory Mechanism was in a sense -encouraging creative destruction in the banking sector". He said he wanted to 
avoid "zombie banks" that do not lend and that interfere with the "chum process between firms entering and exiting the market 
that is a crucial driver of productivity". We wouldn't disagree with these comments. As we have argued many times in the past, 
low default rates are a big feature of this high liquidity world which is great if you're a credit investor but its highly debatable 
whether it's good for the wider economy in so much as it distorts the efficient allocation of capital. Defaults are a good thing 
through time. However with so much debt outstanding now we may have long passed the point where you can allow defaults 
without causing major systemic concerns and subsequent economic weakness. On a separate matter, but also related to the 
banking industry, the FT wrote yesterday that Barclays is planning a "radical overhaul" of its investment bank with a new 
management strategy to be unveiled before the summer. 
Looking at the day ahead, it's likely that the focus will remain squarely on geopolitical developments rather than economic data. 
All eyes are on the Kerry-Lavrov meeting in London today, but it's fair to say that expectations of this meeting are low at this 
point. The world will be watching the Crimean referendum on Sunday, but as we mentioned above, the outcome of the vote 
seems pretty certain at this point and it will be more about how the protagonists react to the formality. The main data releases 
are US producer prices and the UofMichigan consumer confidence report.
