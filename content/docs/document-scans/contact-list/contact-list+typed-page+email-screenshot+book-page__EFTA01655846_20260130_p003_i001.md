U.S. Supreme Court Finds Trump Has Broad Immunity From Prosecution 
Reuters (07/01, Kruzel, Chung) and the Associated Press (07/01, Richer, Tucker, Kunzelman) reported that the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled in favor of granting former President Donald Trump broad immunity from prosecution for 
actions undertaken during his presidency. The 6-3 decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, emphasized that 
constitutional powers provide a former president with absolute immunity for core responsibilities and presumptive 
immunity for actions within the outer perimeter of official duties. This decision overturned a lower court's ruling 
that had denied Trump's claim of immunity regarding federal criminal charges tied to his efforts to contest the 2020 
election outcome. According to the articles, President Biden criticized the ruling, arguing that it establishes a 
dangerous precedent that weakens the legal constraints on presidential power, potentially allowing future 
presidents to act above the law. On the other hand, Trump hailed the decision as a significant victory for the 
Constitution and democracy, asserting it was crucial for the presidency to function without fear of unwarranted 
legal repercussions. The articles explained that Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing a strongly worded dissent joined by 
the other liberal justices, claimed the ruling effectively creates a "law-free zone" around the president. She warned 
of a scenario where the president could misuse his official powers without fear of criminal prosecution, 
dramatically altering the balance of power within the U.S. government. Additional reporting on the story was
