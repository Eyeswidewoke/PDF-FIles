Note. II you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a loom other than Form 
W-9 to request yore TIN, you must use the requester's form if it is substantially 
similar to this Form W-9. 
Definition of a US person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. 
person if you are: 
• An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien: 
• A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the 
United States or under the laws of the United States: 
• An estate (other than a foreign estate): or 
• A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7). 
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in 
the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section 
1446 on any foreign partners' share of effective4y corrected taxable incomefrown 
such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W.9 has not been reCeived, 
the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a 
foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a 
U.S. person that is
 in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the 
United States. provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status 
and avoid section 1446 withholding on you share of partnership income. 
In the cases belOw, the following person must give Form W-9 to the partnership 
for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its 
allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business 
in the United States: 
• In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the 
disregarded entity and not the entity; 
• In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other VS. owner. generally. 
the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the trust: and 
• In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust (other than a 
grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust. 
Foreign person. t you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank 
that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person, do not use Form W-9. Instead. use 
the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see Publication 515. Withholding of Tax 
on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities). 
Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally. only a nonresident 
alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on 
certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as 
a `savng clause." Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an 
exemption horn tax to continue for certain types of income even alter the payee 
has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes. 
If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the 
saving clause of a tax treaty to Claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types 
of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following 
five items: 
1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you 
claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien. 
2. The treaty article addressing the income. 
3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving 
clause and its exceptions. 
4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax 
5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty 
article. 
&ample. Ankle 20 01 the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption 
from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present 
in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien kr 
lax purposes d his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. 
However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 
1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the 
Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student 
who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is 
retying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship 
or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the 
information descnbed above to support Mat exemption. 
If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the 
appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233.

your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.

and dividends only), or

withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened
