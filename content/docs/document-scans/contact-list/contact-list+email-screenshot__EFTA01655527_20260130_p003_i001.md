At Trump's Urging, AG Bondi Says US Will Investigate Epstein's Ties to Clinton and Other Political Foes 
The Associated Press (11/14, Sisak, Bedayn) reported that AG Bondi ordered Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton 
to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's ties to several of President Trump's political opponents after Trump publicly 
demanded that the Justice Department and the FBI pursue an inquiry. AG Bondi's announcement followed Trump's 
social-media posts calling for investigations into Epstein's "involvement and relationship" with figures including Bill 
Clinton, Larry Summers, and Reid Hoffman. According to the article, Trump also said he intended to ask the FBI to 
examine Epstein's alleged connections, even though an FBI memo from July stated, "We did not uncover evidence 
that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties." The article further explained that none of 
the individuals Trump identified have been accused of sexual misconduct by Epstein's victims, and assessed that 
Trump's demand — and AG Bondi's swift compliance — marked another example of the Justice Department's 
erosion of independence. The article noted that Trump defended his actions by telling reporters, "I'm the chief law 
enforcement officer of the country. I'm allowed to do it." The BBC (11/16, Sullivan) reported that Trump has called 
on House Republicans to vote to release the Epstein files, reversing his previous position. The House is expected to 
vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which aims to release all unclassified records related to Jeffrey Epstein. 
The article highlighted that the major shift in Trump's stance comes as potentially dozens of Republicans signaled 
that they were willing to break ranks, and vote for the release of the documents. Trump would also have to sign off
