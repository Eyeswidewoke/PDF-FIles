SRLPI 02 Alpha Group Capital 
Siris Capital Group 
Siris Partners IV, L.P. 
US Middle Market Buyout: Technology  
The Offering 
Siris Partners IV ("Skis IV" or the "Fund") is being formed by Siris Capital Group ("Skis"): 
Siris is a New York-based private equity firm targeting deep value, mature technology 
businesses in their transition to growth 
Three founders have worked together for over 18 years 
-$5.5bn cumulative fund commitments; Invested $4.7bn of equity across 14 
investments1
Strategy 
Siris invests In transitioning technology companies that have both a strong legacy 
business (the "Bond") and robust next generation growth initiatives (the "Call Option") 
• "Bond": Predictable cash flows; mission-critical products and services; leading market 
share2
• "Call Option": "Mega" technology trends with significant potential upside; target 
potential for outsized returns through strategic sale or !PCP 
Highlights 
• Differentiated and value-focused Bond / Call Option investment strategy targeting a 
less-competitive segment of the technology market 
• Bond / Call separation facilitates focus on returning capital to investors quickly 
through dividend recapitalizations and asset sales; first liquidity event in 5/6 realized 
or partially realized investments took place in less than 24 months 
• Post acquisition operational improvements the primary driver of returns 
• Deep working relationships and industry expertise with Executive (operating) Partners 
• Research driven proprietary sourcing targeting primarily publicly traded companies 
Disciplined purchase price and conservative use of leverage versus market 
• Siris' avg. acquisition multiple of 5.8x''
