Two Staff Members of Israeli Embassy Killed Outside of FBI Field Office in Washington, DC 
The Associated Press (05/22, Sweedler) reported that two staff members of the Israeli embassy in Washington 
were shot and killed near a Jewish museum by a suspect who yelled "Free, free Palestine" after being arrested. The 
suspect, identified as Elias Rodriguez, 30, of Chicago, opened fire on a group of people leaving an event at the 
Capital Jewish Museum. The incident has been condemned by Israeli and US officials, including Israeli President 
Isaac Herzog and President Donald Trump, as a despicable act of hatred and antisemitism. "These horrible D.C. 
killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW!" President Donald Trump posted on social media early 
Thursday. "Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that 
such things as this can happen! God Bless You ALL!" Reuters (05/22, Staff Writer) highlighted that Director Patel 
said he and his team had been briefed on the shooting. "While we're working with the Metropolitan Police 
Department to respond and learn more, in the immediate, please pray for the victims and their families," he wrote 
on X. Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (05/21, Murphy), Axios (05/21, Falconer, Ravid),

Justice Department Seizes Domains Behind Major Information-Stealing Malware Operation 
CyberScoop (05/21, Kapko) and Reuters (05/21, Bain]) reported that Lumma Stealer, a widely used infostealer 
malware, was dismantled through a globally coordinated operation led by Microsoft and involving law enforcement 
agencies such as the FBI and Europol. According to the articles, the operation seized Lumma Stealer's central 
command, malicious domains, and marketplaces, blocking around 2,300 malicious domains and disrupting the 
malware's infrastructure. The articles noted that the takedown effort, which also involved cybersecurity companies 
like ESET and Cloudflare, aims to slow down cybercrime attacks and hinder the illicit profits of threat actors, 
including the primary developer "Shamel," based in Russia. The articles added that the U.S. Department of Justice 
said on Wednesday that it has seized five internet domains used by malicious cyber actors to operate the LummaC2 
information-stealing malware service. The FBI's Dallas Field Office is investigating the case. "The FBI is committed 
to disrupting the key services that cyber criminals rely on," said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI's Cyber 
Division in the press release. "That's why, with our partners, we took action against the most popular infostealer 
service available in online criminal markets, which is responsible for millions of attacks against victims. Thanks to 
partnerships with the private sector, we were able to disrupt the LummaC2 infrastructure and seize user panels. 
Together we are making it harder and more painful for cyber criminals to operate." Additional reporting on the
