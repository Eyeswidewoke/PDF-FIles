FBI Daily News Briefing 
Aviation A27 (08/11, Derby) reported that the FBI has revealed that Turkey served as a transit hub for foreign 
fighters attempting to join ISIS, with many traveling from Istanbul to cities near the Syrian border. According to the 
article, a U.S. citizen, Mohamed Fathy Suliman, used this route in 2014, flying from Orlando to Istanbul and then to 
Gaziantep, before attempting to cross into Syria with the help of smugglers. The article highlighted that FBI Special 
Agent R. David Collins stated that Kilis was a key overland route for ISIS travel both into and out of Syria. The agent 
noted that the methods used by Suliman were consistent with similar cases of foreign fighters who exploited 
Turkey's geography and infrastructure. The article explained that the FBI's investigation found that Turkish 
authorities often released detained fighters, allowing them to continue toward Syria, and that Turkey's National 
Intelligence Organization facilitated the movement of foreign fighters into Syria during the early years of the Syrian 
conflict.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Continued Reporting: Texas Soldier With Top Secret Clearance Charged in Attempt to Leak Abrams Tank 
Data to Russia 
Clearance Jobs (08/11, Burgess) reported that Taylor A. Lee, a 22-year-old US Army specialist with Top Secret 
clearance, was arrested for attempting to leak sensitive information about the M1A2 Abrams tank to Russia. 
According to the article, Lee faces charges under the Espionage Act and the Arms Export Control Act for trying to 
transmit national defense information and export-controlled technical data without authorization. The arrest was 
the result of a sting operation in which Lee believed he was communicating with a Russian government 
representative, but was actually interacting with an undercover FBI agent roleplaying as a foreign intelligence 
officer. KFOX (FOX-14) (08/11, Burgess) noted that Lee was arrested on August 6 and is facing charges, with the 
case ongoing after his first hearing in federal court, where an FBI agent testified about the investigation and 
evidence against him. 
Analysis: China Shamelessly Pillages Tech From the West 
An analysis piece published by Tribune India (08/11, Staff Writer) reported that China has been accused of 
shamelessly pillaging technology from the West, with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) encouraging private 
companies to partner with Western firms, learn from them, and eventually go solo. According to Zang Qichao, a 
Chinese equity capital expert, China has been copying Western technology and intellectual property for decades, 
with the government introducing plans like the Made in China 2025 Plan to transition China into a high-tech 
economy. The article noted that the U.S. has taken measures to restrict China's access to advanced technologies, 
but China continues to exploit Western institutions and companies, with the FBI warning that China's goal is to 
become a comprehensive national power and surpass the U.S. as a global superpower.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Continued Reporting: Atlanta CDC, Emory University Shooting 
The New York Times (08/11, McFadden, Mandavilli, Keenan) reported that on August 8, 2025, a shooting at the 
CDC headquarters in Atlanta left DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose, 33, and the suspected gunman, 30-year-
old Patrick Joseph White of Kennesaw, Georgia, dead. The incident began with a 911 call about an active shooter at 
a CVS across from the CDC, during which bullets struck at least four CDC buildings but caused no injuries to 
employees or civilians. White, armed with five guns, had reportedly become fixated on the belief that COVID-19 
vaccines caused his health problems, a conviction influenced by personal struggles and prior suicide attempts. By 
Saturday, local, state, and federal investigators were working to piece together the motive and sequence of events, 
as the targeted attack fueled broader concerns about rising threats to public health workers amid supposed 
persistent vaccine misinformation, with CDC staff voicing frustration over anti-vaccine rhetoric from Health 
Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Director Patel posted the following statement on X: "Pray for the family, friends, and 
colleagues of this hero who acted quickly to defend others and made the ultimate sacrifice. The FBI will offer them 
our full support." Additional reporting was provided by Atlanta Journal-Constitution (08/11, Jacobson, Hughes),
