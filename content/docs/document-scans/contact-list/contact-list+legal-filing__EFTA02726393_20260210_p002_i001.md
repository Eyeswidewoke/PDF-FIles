1) LTE — The new 4G technology 
A hot favourte at present because t's the latest, fastest and newest kid on the block. Network operators are ful of 
technologists who bye playing with the latest toys. 
LTE S also mportant for brand marketing, ensuring a badershp postbn through the promise of high speed, low latency 
connections. However, is relevant in the short term unless customers buy new smartphones (which are usually subsidised 
by the network operator). In many cases, is not a 'quick win" because of the tine taken for the nstaled base of 
smartphones to be upgraded. This is why we are seeing some operators bolting to provide Mel LTE coverage through 
metre macrocels, but instal substantial capacty on the ground using 3G small eels. 
It's also worth noting that the peak achievable weeds of LTE are unikely to be entered (for sustained periods) using 
macrocels, due to tick of capacty. The short range of a radio Ina to the nearby metrocel (Mach could be 3G or LTE) wit 
usuaty delver better performance, altering the hghest order modulation to be used for maximum speed and efficiency. 
Even fan operator could gain access to 3x the current spectrum and deploy LTE throughout (wth a questionable 6x 
capacty gain), this would std fat short of the 20 fold or higher growth requited - especiay n the hghest traffic hotspots. 
2) WI-n - A quick for? 
We've seen some great strides being made wth Wi-fr in recent years. Operators have accepted the technology as a 
complementary and essential component of the overall solution. Mass takeup has enabled k to be very low cost, ea* 
understood (and becoming even easier to use), and compettile wth al recent smartphones. 
Today, many operators provide their customers with easy access to large numbers of WFFl hotspots, ether deploying ther 
own or through wholesale arrangements wth Wr-Fi aggregators (or both). TM increases the total capacty of the network 
dramalcaly, and relieves the pressure in high traffic environments AT&T and Verizon report that over hay they noble data 
traffic now passes through thei pubic Wi-A network 
Customers, particularly -power users', wit actively seek out Wi-F hotspots in order to find better throughput. Some apps and 
services are restrtted to work only over WhFr, rather than 3G. 
But S this what customers realy want? Surely we want sinpicty and to be &rays connected. That mews dentifyirg and 
searnlessiy connected to a W FFl hotspot h the area when t makes sense, but being able to continue a not in range and/or 
when wakng about. 
The comparatively low RF power of a WhFlhotspot (100mW maximum compared to perhaps 1 to 2W for a metrocel or 20W 
for a macrocel) is Ideal for indoor envronments but inks range when outdoors. 
A nye of both Wi-Fi and cellular can be a winning combination, but the evdence from Korea and Japan suggests that relying 
solely on huge numbers of pubic access WrA hotspots (networks In those countres had 100,000's deployed) won't delver 
the quaky of service to large numbers of users at high throughput on is own. 
3) Business as usuak More and higher opacity macrooells 
The numbers of macrocels in urban areas isn't growing. Ste acquisitbn is diffcut and costly. That's partly because people 
are becoming more senstive to highly vale masts on the skyline and also because landlords continue to be keen to expbt 
ther monopoly. 
Qute apart from the irritations due to the laws of physics, the commercial costs don't compere wel vrith metrocel 
deployments. A recent Alcatel-Lucent study compared the two approaches for a typical Western European urban area found 
a 38% total cost saving. There is a traffic densty threshold beyond where metrocels become the cheaper sobton. Traffic 
levels it most developed urban cues have already crossed that pont. 
4) Deploy Metrocels 
A dense underlay of metrocels can delver unbelievable amounts of total capacty, which is exactly what's gong to be 
needed in the not to distant future. But being closer to the user has other benefts. The short range provides a much 
better quaky radio channel, which can acheve higher weeds and better throughput. There wi be a lower battery drain on 
the handset device, increasing battery We. There are many more potential locations to instal metrocels (athough more are 
needed). An extra beneft s that each metrocel frees up capacty on the rrecrocet Locations which are difficut to reach 
because they are deep nCoors, behind buddngs etc, consume a lot of the tote mecrocel resource to delver a ratites, slow 
throughput. 
Planning push or customer put? 
Network planners have a tough job looking at how best they can meet traffic demand. They are Web to prOrtkie investments 
where they see the most serous capacty shortfaNs, both current and predicted. 
But equally, customers themselves wll become more aware of which networks are more Rey to meet their needs. As we become 
ever more reliant on remaining connected 'on-grld; those networks who fal to keep pace wth ther compettors "Quaky of 
Experience' risk losing subscribers and market share. 
This bads to the question of how urgent t is to make a choice and start nelementrig t. 
403 folk:to:Wien to deploy metrocells? 
Fanning and deployment of metrocels isn't sin* a scaled down equivalent of the same process used today for macrocels A 
whole range of factors needs to be considered, nerving but not treed to: 
• Are different network performance measurement and reportng tools required,
• How does redo planning need to evolve to determne deal metrocelbcations? 
• What operational processes need to adapt to allow seeing up of the deployment process to handle 10x the number of 
ce/sites? 
• What backhaul technologies should be used to connect the notrocels(especbly for the last ride)? 
• What aspects of the Operatim are best outsourced? 
• HOW does the commercial nvestment returns change for a metrocel network?
