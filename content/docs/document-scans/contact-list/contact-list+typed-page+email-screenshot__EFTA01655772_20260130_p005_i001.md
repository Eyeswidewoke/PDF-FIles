York Past (02/15, King) reported that the Pentagon confirmed that six satellites, including ones with advanced 
missile tracking technology, were successfully launched into orbit Wednesday — a day after alarming US intel 
revealed Russia wants to put nuclear weapons in space to target Western satellites. The article explained that two 
of those satellites will buttress the Missile Defense Agency's Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor 
program and the other four are configured for tracking spacecraft. "This launch represents a pivotal time for MDA 
as we enter a new phase of missile warning, tracking and defense," Lt. Gen. Heath Collins, director of MDA said. 
"These HBTSS satellites are an essential step forward in our efforts to stay ahead of our adversaries." An additional 
article from the New York Post (02/15, Christenson) reported that House Freedom Caucus member Andy Ogles (R-
TN) asked Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) on Thursday to probe Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner's 
decision to reveal the "serious national security threat" to the American public that could involve Russian space 
nukes. The article noted that Ogles wrote a letter to Johnson demanding a formal inquiry of the disclosure and 
accusing Turner of doing so with "a reckless disregard of the implications and consequences said information would 
have on geopolitics, domestic and foreign markets, or the well-being and psyche of the American people."

District Attorney in Trump's Georgia Case Pushes Back: 'I'm Not on Trial' 
The Associated Press (02/15, Brumback, Richer) reported that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis defended 
herself against allegations of misconduct due to her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, which has 
become a focal point in Donald Trump's 2020 election interference case. According to the article, Willis vehemently 
denied the claims, emphasizing that the trial concerns the defendants' efforts to undermine the 2020 election, not 
her personal conduct. The article noted that the controversy has led to scrutiny of Willis and Wade, potentially 
affecting the case against Trump and others accused of conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results 
in Georgia. The New York Times (02/15, Fausset, Hakim) explained that if Willis is disqualified, the case would be in 
limbo and potentially reassigned to another Georgia prosecutor by the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, 
potentially impacting the prosecution of Trump and his allies for their efforts to overturn the 2020 election results 
in Georgia. The article added that the council's executive director, Pete Skandalakis, faces a complex decision with 
limited options due to the case's complexity and political sensitivity, involving 15 defendants, including Trump and 
his former chief of staff. Additional reporting on the story was provided by the Wall Street Journal (02/15, Timms,
