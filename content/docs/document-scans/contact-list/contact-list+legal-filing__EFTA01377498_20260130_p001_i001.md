O 
Financials have 
tmderperformed the overall 
equity market over the last 
month, due in part to concerns 
over Greece. But we are still 
positive on financials over a 
3-12 months time horizon. 
Valuations remain attractive, 
with the MSCI AC World 
Financials Index now trading 
at around a 20% price-to-
earnings (PIE) discount to 
the MSCI AC World Index 
(according to Standard & 
Poor's). This discount is likely 
to narrow over time, if financial 
firms' balance-sheet quality 
continues to Improve.

Atter a difficult few months, 
Indian equities started to pick 
up steam in mid-June and 
have continued to perform 
well since then. Recent gains 
may have been helped by the 
redeployment of funds by 
international investors from 
a faltering Chinese equity 
market. At a domestic level, 
there is also evidence that 
spending on infrastructure 
is starting to Increase. Other 
medium-term positives are 
likely to be accommodative 
monetary policy and 
expectations of further reform. 
German housing

Recently published estimates 
by the Dallas Fed suggest 
that German housing prices 
continued to increase in 
the first quarter after steady 
gains in 2009-14. Continuing 
support for prices is likely to 
come from Eurozone monetary 
policy, which probably 
remains too expansionary 
for the German economy. 
Despite the sustained rise in 
German housing prices, we 
do not appear to be entering 
into an unsustainable real-
estate bubble, with German 
mortgage debt increasing only 
modestly. 
U.S. leisure and 
entertainment

Performance since initiation 
According to advance 
estimates, U.S. restaurant and 
bar sales were down 0.2% 
month-on-month in June but 
were tip 7.7% from a year 
earlier. This compares with 
a rise of 1.4% for retail sales 
overall. Trends in U.S. airline 
travel and hotels have been 
less clear-cut. But as the labor 
market continues to improve, 
wage growth accelerates and 
home and equity prices edge 
higher, spending on leisure 
and entertainment should pick 
up further later this year. 
High-conviction ideas may not be suitable for all investors. Investments come with risk. The value of an investment can tall as well 
as rise and your capital may be at risk. You might not get back the amount originally invested at any point in time. Some investments 
may not be suitable for all investors and investors should seek professional advice before investing. The examples above are shown 
for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered to be an offer or solicitation, advice or recommendation. It is not possible 
to invest directly in an index.
