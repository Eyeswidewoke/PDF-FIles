What Makes Online-Only Statements So Great? 
Less paper - No need to file away all those bulky statements. You 
can always view your six most-recent billing statements online. Need 
an older statement? You can order an archived copy going back to 
October 2004. 
View and sort - You can view recent activity since your last statement 
and sort through your transactions by date, merchant or amount. 
Peace of mind - Know that your online statement can't be lost or 
stolen in the mail.
