The U.S. Is Bracing for Complex, Fast-Moving Threats to Elections This Year, Director Wray Warns 
The Associated Press (02/29, Tucker) reported that in anticipation of this year's elections, the United States expects 
to confront complex and swiftly evolving threats, significantly influenced by technological advancements such as 
artificial intelligence, Director Wray revealed. Speaking at a national security conference, Director Wray 
emphasized, "The U.S. has confronted foreign malign influence threats in the past. But this election cycle, the U.S. 
will face more adversaries, moving at a faster pace, and enabled by new technology." According to the article, 
Director Wray's remarks underscored the growing concern within the U.S. government regarding hard-to-detect 
operations aimed at shaping public opinion. Director Wray also indicated the FBI's commitment to sharing 
information about threats, stating, "As intelligence professionals, we've got to highlight threats in specific, 
evidence-based ways so that we're usefully arming our partners and, in particular, the public against the kinds of 
foreign influence operations they're likely to confront." VOA News (02/29, Seldin) reported that Director Wray 
suggested that the list of countries and other foreign groups seeking to influence U.S. voters is set to expand. "Al is 
most useful for what I would call kind of mediocre bad guys and making them kind of like intermediate;' he said. 
"The really sophisticated adversaries are using Al more just to increase the speed and scale of their efforts," he 
said. "But we are coming towards a day very soon where what I would call the experts, the most sophisticated 
adversaries, are going to find ways to use Al to be even more elite." CNN (02/29, Lyngaas) added that Director Wray 
also spoke about non-election-related threats, saying that the FBI was "intensely focused" on a range of cyber and 
national security threats from the Chinese government. The article noted that as for Iran, Director Wray said that 
Tehran "has been more brazen over the last few years than I've seen in my career." Additional reporting on the 
story was provided by The Record (02/29, Matishak), Clearance Jobs (02/29, Hamilton), and C-SPAN (02/29, Video). 
The FBI posted a transcript of Director Wray's opening remarks.
