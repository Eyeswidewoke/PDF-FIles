Because we receive, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by our users. we are also impacted by laws and 
regulations governing privacy. use of personal data and data breaches, primarily in the case of our operations in the European Union. As a result. we could 
be subject to various private and governmental claims and actions. See Risk factors—Risks relating to our business—Unauthorized access of personal data 
could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights." 
As the provider of dating products with a membership-based element, we are also subject to laws and regulations in certain U.S. states and other countries 
that apply to our automatically-renewing membership payment models. Finally, certain U.S. states and certain countries in Asia have laws that specifically

Employees 
As of September 30, 2015. we had approximately 1.500 full-time employees and approximately 3,300 part-time employees worldwide. Substantially all of our 
part-time employees are employed by our non-dating businesses and perform academic tutoring, test preparation and college counseling services. We are not 
subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 
Intellectual property 
We regard our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property, as critical to our success. 
For example, we rely heavily upon the use of trademarks (primarily Match, Meetic, OkCupid, OurTime. Tinder and The Princeton Review, and associated 
domain names, taglines and logos) to market our dating products and applications and build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition. We have an ongoing 
trademark and service mark registration program, pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos and renew existing 
trademark and service mark registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions to the extent we determine it to be necessary or otherwise appropriate 
and cost-effective. In addition, we have a trademark and service mark monitoring policy pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to 
register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours, as well as potential unauthorized use of our material trademarks and service 
marks. Our enforcement of this policy affords us valuable protection under current laws, rules and regulations. We also reserve and file registrations (to the 
extent available) and renew existing registrations for domain names that we believe are material to our business. 
We also rely upon a combination of in-licensed third-party and proprietary trade secrets. including proprietary algorithms. and to a lesser extent. upon 
patented and patent-pending technologies. processes

contractors, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others, to establish, protect and otherwise control access to our venous intellectual property nghts.
