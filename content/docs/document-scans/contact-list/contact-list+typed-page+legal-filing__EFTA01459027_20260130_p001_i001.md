When we launched this idea, 
we cautioned that there could 
be several more uncertain 
months before the sector 
eventually stabilized. This 
has moved to be the case: 
Volkswagen's problems have 
deepened in recent weeks, 
with Increasing numbers of 
autos likely to be recalled. 
However, we believe that 
corporate investment-grade 
bonds in this sector appear to 
offer a lower-risk alternative 
to equities for investors with a 
longer-term horizon.

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot 
Index has been moving 
upwards since the middle of 
October, with the U.S. dollar 
gaining ground against both 
developed and emerging. 
market currencies. In part, 
this was the result of market 
expectations of further 
monetary stimulus from 
both the EC B and the BOJ. 
The strengthening of many 
emerging-market currencies in 
early October after major falls 
earlier in 2015 - also appears 
to have run out of steam.

Global financials are likely 
to gain from an upwards 
turn in the U.S. interest-rate 
cycle Rising dividends and 
share buybacks, as wallas 
valuations, are also likely to be 
positives. Possible negatives 
include the impact of banking-
activity regulation although 
banks are taking action to 
offset such headwinds, 
for example through cost-
cutting. Emerging-market 
opportunities may also exist 
although selectivity will be 
critical.

Investmeht horizon -

Performance since initiation 
The Nifty Index has fallen 
recently, in part due 
to concerns about the 
implications of a December 
Fed rate hike. But, over the 
longer term, we remain 
positive on Indian equities. 
The government is keen to 
push on with reforms. In early 
November it eased restrictions 
on foreign direct investment 
in 15 major sectors including 
defense, civil aviation and 
mining and also increased 
the ability of the Foreign 
investment Promotion Board 
to give one-off approvals. 
High-conviction ideas may not be suitable for all investors. Investments come with risk. The value of an investment can fall as well 
as rise and your capital may be at risk You might not get back the amount originally invested Many point in time. Some investments 
may not be suitable for all investors and investors should seek professional advice before investing. The examples above are shown 
for illustrative purposes only ancl should not be considered to be an offer or solicitation, advice or recommendation. It is not possible 
to invest directly in an index.
