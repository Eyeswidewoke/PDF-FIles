3060 Consciousness 
Faculty: IBA, Faculty 
TR 
11:55 AM - 01:35 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7362 Sec A 
This course is an introduction to the scientific and philosophical exploration of subjective 
experience, what some have called the last great mystery of science. We will examine the 
relationship between objective brain processes and first-person awareness, findings from 
psychology and neuroscience. as well as discussing altered states (drugs. out-of-body-
experiences). lucid dreams. mysticism, and Western and Eastern philosophy. What Is the 
relationship between consciousness and attention? Can a machine ever be conscious? Is 
consciousness fundamental in the universe las Eastern philosophies argue) or did it emerge as 
matter became ever more complex (as Western science insists)? Is there a stream of 
consciousness or is it Just an illusion? Do we realty ever make conscious decisions or are these 
decisions already made before we become conscious of them? What is this thing we call 
consciousness and how does It fit Into (or can it fit into) the current materialist orthodox view of 
the universe? Are our brains capable of ever understanding the nature of awareness. or is it 
forever beyond our reach? These are some of the questions we will be asking during the course.

How do individuals. families, and nations remember their past? How is the past represented and 
inscribed in the present? What social practices ensure that memories will be preserved? What are 
the politics surrounding the establishment of these social practice? To what extent are the 
collective memories of a community grounded in the individual memories of community 
members? And how do the memories Individuals and communities hold shape their identity and 
determine their individual and collective action? These questions rest at the core of the emerging 
field of Memory Studies. This course will review the seminal works in the area that will offer a 
foundation for understanding both the formation and use of collective memories, It is 
multidisciplinary, in that It pulls from works in sociology. anthropology. political science. 
psychology, history, and the humanities. The course will be a collaborative effort between William 
Hirst at Lang College and Brian Schiff at the American University of Paris. Classes will take place 
concurrently in New York and Paris. There will be field trips to sites of memory in the two locals, as
