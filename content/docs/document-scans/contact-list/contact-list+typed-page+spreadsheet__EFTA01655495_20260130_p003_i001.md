Brennan, Strzok, Page Subpoenaed as Part of Federal Russiagate Probe

former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page as part of the Justice Department's probe into the origins of the

declassified records and internal reviews found the FBI's senior leadership pushed for the dossier's inclusion

General Michael Horowitz and Special Counsel John Durham later criticized the FBI for "significant inaccuracies and 
omissions" in FISA warrants targeting former Trump campaign aide Carter Page and for "failing to act on a clear 
warning sign" that the bureau was being manipulated for political purposes. The article stated that Durham
