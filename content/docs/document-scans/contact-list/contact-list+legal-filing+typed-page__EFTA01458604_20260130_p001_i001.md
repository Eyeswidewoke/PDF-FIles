High-conviction ideas 
Selected investment ideas to complement wealth-management clients' portfolios 
Long U.S. dollar 
Rica initiated 
September 1, 2015 
Reference measure 
Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index 
vs. cash' 
Investment horizon 
3 12 months 
Performance trincie initiation 
In the Bloomberg Dollar 
Spot Index, recent euro 
and Japanese yen strength 
has outweighed continued 
emerging-market currency 
weakness, resulting Ina tall 
in the index. In the coming 
months, we expect developed-
market currencies to start to 
weaken again, due in part to 
monetary-policy divergence, 
prompting a more marked 
U.S.-dollar appreciation. Risks 
would include an unexpected 
slowdown In U.S. growth 
(particularly relative to other 
large regions). 
Global financials 
Idea initiated 
July 1, 2015 
Reference measure 
MSC( AC World Financials 
indeot vs. MSCI AC World 
index's 
Investment horizon 
3 - 12 months 
Portermance since inmanon 
Financials have lagged 
the broader equity market 
recently. Aside from general 
worries around the global 
economy (e.g. China), the 
low-yield environment has 
impacted margins and the 
effect of increased regulation 
remains a concern. However, 
on a 3- to 12-month horizon, 
we believe that the turn in the 
U.S. interest-rate cycle is a 
positive, as should be rising 
dividends and share buybacks. 
Valuations may also appeal, 
but selectivity is key here, 
particularly in the emerging 
markets.

PerfOrManCti since in)!tiallon 
Over the last month, Indian 
equities have fallen back but 
have still proved resilient 
compared to many other 
emerging markets. We believe 
india's external-financing 
position will probably mean 
that it is less affected by rate 
hikes by the U.S. Federal 
Reserve (the Fed) than many 
other Asian economies 
although it will not be immune. 
Domestically, accommodative 
monetary policy and 
expectations of further reforms 
are also positives. The Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) could cut 
rates further later this year. 
German housing

MSCI IPD OFIX Germany vs

With ECB quantitative easing 
set to continue for some time, 
Eurozone monetary policy is 
likely to remain too loose for 
the German economy, where 
a recent faltering in investor 
confidence has yet to translate 
into any meaningful reduction 
in economic activity. Loose 
monetary policy is unlikely 
to translate into a real-estate 
"bubble", but German housing 
prices look likely to continue to 
rise at a modest pace. 
High-conviction ideas may not be suitable for all investors. Investments come with risk. The value of an investment can fall as well 
as rise and your capital may be at risk You might not get back the amount originally invested Many point in time. Some investments 
may not be suitable for all investors and investors should seek professional advice before investing. The examples above are shown 
for illustrative purposes only ancl should not be considered to be an offer or solicitation, advice or recommendation.
