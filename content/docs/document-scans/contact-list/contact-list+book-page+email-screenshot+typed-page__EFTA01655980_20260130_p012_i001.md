Treasury Sanctions Crypto Scam Facilitator That Allegedly Stole $200M From U.S. Victims 
CyberScoop (05/29, Kapko) reported that the Treasury Department sanctioned Funnull Technology and its 
administrator, Liu Lizhi, for facilitating cryptocurrency scams that defrauded U.S. victims of over $200 million. 
According to the article, Funnull provided infrastructure, including IP addresses and hosting services, to support 
scam sites and used domain generation algorithms to aid cybercriminals. The article noted that the sanctions aim 
to disrupt the operations of Funnull, which played a significant role in the scam ecosystem by enabling 
cybercriminals to impersonate trusted brands and redirect legitimate site visitors to fraudulent sites. "During 
cryptocurrency investment fraud scams, perpetrators pose as potential romantic partners or friends to gain victims' 
trust, who are then convinced to invest in virtual currency," the FBI said in a cybersecurity advisory published 
Thursday. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Reuters (05/29, Satter), BleepingComputer (05/29,
