High school students participating in the State Police Youth Academy last week got to see more action than 
they expected. A driver who police think was high, barreled through a fence and onto the training track at State 
Police headquarters. (KRQE) 
NMSU under fire for new  policy regarding student-athletes 
Student-athletes at New Mexico State will now fall under the same code of conduct as regular students, and 
not necessarily be held to a higher standard. Under the old policy, a student-athlete faced automatic dismissal 
when convicted of a felony. That is not the case any longer. (KRQE) 
Criminals beware. D.A. knows who  your friends are. 
It's likely that a man seen on surveillance video breaking into a pawn shop through a ceiling would have 
gotten off with probation or a small jail sentence, prosecutors say. Why? Because he had never been arrested 
for a violent crime. (KOAT) 
Judge dismisses case against former senator 
A judge granted a motion Thursday made by an attorney for former state Sen. Timothy Jennings, D-Roswell, 
to dismiss a case against the former legislator for failing to immediately report a vehicle accident to law 
enforcement. Buddy Hall, a magistrate judge from De Baca County who heard the case Thursday during a 
motion hearing in Chaves County Magistrate Court, granted the motion by the defense to dismiss the case with 
prejudice — meaning charges can not be railed. (Roswell Daily Record)

County, gov's office argue over contact after state of emergency declaration 
Following a county commission meeting where Otero County Commission Chairman Couy Griffin and other 
commissioners voiced their dismay that Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's office has not responded to the county 
directly since a declaration of emergency, the governor's office responded that "the Otero County Commission 
never directly contacted the Governor's Office over their concerns." To disprove this, Otero County sent a 
response to the governor's office showing that the county contacted them via fax, email and certified mail in 
April following the county declaring a state of emergency. (Alamogordo Daily News) 
Reports, but no confirmation of ICE raid in Taos 
This month's announcement that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would round up 
undocumented immigrants starting Sunday (July 14) caused hysteria throughout the nation, including in Taos, 
where a few local residents reported sightings of the federal agents. Local law enforcement heard the rumors, 
too, but agency heads said they could not confirm the federal agency's presence in the county this week. (Taos

US lawmakers  propose ban on export of tribes' sacred items 
A group of U.S. lawmakers made another push Thursday to ban collectors and vendors from exporting Native 
American ceremonial items to foreign markets, including Paris, where there has been uproar over auction 
houses listing tribal pieces for sale over the years. The lawmakers introduced legislation that would increase 
penalties within the United States for trafficking objects that tribes hold sacred by increasing prison time from 
five years to 10 years for violating the law more than once. (AP)
