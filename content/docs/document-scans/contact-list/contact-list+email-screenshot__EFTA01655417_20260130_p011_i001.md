The Washington Post (09/03, Goba, Kane) reported that House Republicans have formed a new subcommittee to 
reinvestigate the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. According to the article, the subcommittee, likely to be 
headed by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Georgia), will have subpoena power and aims to uncover the "full truth" about 
the attack. The article explained that Democrats have criticized the move, saying it's an attempt to reopen a 
polarizing chapter in American politics and undermine the work of the original January 6 select committee, which 
was led by Democrats. The article highlighted that the Jan. 6 clash — which spawned the largest domestic 
investigation in the FBI's history — left Congress, especially the House, cleaved in a bitter partisan divide. 
Feds in LA Launch Animal Abuse Task Force 
MynewsLA (09/03, Staff Writer) reported that federal officials in Los Angeles have launched a new task force to 
prosecute animal abuse cases, including "animal crush" videos. According to the article, the task force will be led by 
federal prosecutors and will work in partnership with agencies such as the FBI and the Los Angeles Police 
Department. "Animal abuse is among the most heartbreaking and despicable types of crimes that law enforcement 
sees," Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement. "Together with our federal and local partners, my office 
intends to root out and punish those who profit from hurting animals." 
Police Agencies Lower Education Standards as Staffing Shortages Persist 
The Ohio Capital Journal (09/04, Ruelas) reported that police agencies in the U.S., including the New York Police 
Department and the Dallas Police Department, are lowering education standards for new recruits to address 
staffing shortages. According to the article, the FBI will no longer require a four-year degree for new recruits 
starting in October, and other federal agencies like ICE are also loosening their standards. The article explained that 
experts say that while a college education can be beneficial for police officers, it's not the only factor in 
determining what makes a good officer, and agencies should consider other characteristics like work history, 
maturity, and judgment.
