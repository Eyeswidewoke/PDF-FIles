376 III. App. 3d 599, *; 876 N.E.2d 129, **; 
2007 III. App. LEXIS 962, ***; 315 III. Dec. 129 
granted new counsel leave to appear on behalf of the Swentos and denied the Swentos' 
motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for August 7, 2006. 
On July 19, 2006, the Swentos filed their fourth amended affirmative defenses, which 
included an additional third affirmative defense that the Swentos were discharged of their 
obligations under the personal guaranty when CEC entered into the Agreement on 
January 26, 2001, because the Agreement included changes to the lease that materially 
increased the risk that the Swentos had previously agreed to guaranty. 
On August 7, 2006, prior to trial, CEC presented a motion in limine to exclude the Swentos 
from presenting evidence relating to an alleged increase in risk that released them from 
their personal guaranty under the lease. In its motion, CEC argued that, as a matter of law, 
none of r..12] the June 26, 2001, Agreement provisions could have materially increased 
the risk assumed by the Swentos so as to discharge their obligations under the personal 
guaranty. CEC asserted that none of the essential terms of the original lease, such as the 
amount of rent, were changed by the Agreement and the performance required of the 
tenant remained the same. Rather, CEC asserted that by providing the ["6O6] tenant with 
the opportunity to cure its default and enter a repossession agreement. CEC substantially 
mitigated the damages that otherwise would have been caused by the tenant's breach. 
On August 8, 2001, the circuit court granted CEC's motion in limine to exclude evidence 
relating to an alleged increase in risk incurred by the Swentos. The parties then agreed 
that the only remaining issue to be determined by the jury was the extent of CEC's 
damages. The circuit court therefore granted a directed verdict on liability against the 
Swentos and the matter proceeded to trial on the issue of damages. The jury found CEC's 
damages for unpaid rent and property damage to be $ 246,588.38, and a verdict in that 
amount was entered against the Swentos. A corresponding judgment for property 
damages was (***13] also entered against Jeepers Illinois and Jeepers, in addition to the 
r1361 previous judgment entered against those entities for unpaid rent. The circuit court 
also entered judgment in the Swentos' favor and against their co-guarantor Jeepers, under 
the separate indemnification agreement that the Swentos had entered into with Jeepers. 
Subsequently, on October 23, 2006, the circuit court granted GEC's request for attorney 
fees. The Swentos filed a notice of appeal challenging the circuit court's August 8, 2006, 
order granting CEC's motion in limine and the court's October 23, 2006, order granting 
CEC's request for attorney fees. 
II. Analysis 
A. Motion In Limine 
On appeal, the Swentos first contend that the circuit court erred by granting CEC's motion 
in limine to exclude evidence relating to an alleged increase in risk where the Swentos 
argue that they were unaware of the Agreement and the Agreement constituted a material 
change under the lease which should have discharged the Swentos' obligations as 
guarantors. 
1. Standard of Review 
[I-IN1] "A motion in limine is addressed to the trial court's inherent power to admit or 
exclude evidence," and, generally, this "court will not disturb the trial court's ['**14] ruling
