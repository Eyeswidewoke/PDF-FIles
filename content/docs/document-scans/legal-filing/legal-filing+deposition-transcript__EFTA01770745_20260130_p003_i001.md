International pressure on the Islamic Republic has never been higher. In addition to the new, crippling U.S. sanctions 
enacted on Dec. 31 <http://blogs.wsj.com/corruption-currents/2012/01/03/obama-signs-iran-central-bank-sanctions-
into-lawk and Feb. 6 <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/06/obama-new-sanctions-iran-central-bank> , the 
European Union recently pledged <http://blogs.wsj.com/corruption-currents/2012/01/23/eu-imposes-iran-oil-embargo-
central-bank-freezeh to halt the importation of Iranian oil by July 1. Iran's economy is reeling. 
For their part, Iranian leaders have struck an increasingly aggressive note. They have threatened 
chttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/world/europe/iran-says-it-will-cut-oil-supplies-to-6-european-nations.html> a 
preemptive strike against their foes, and warned that they could close <http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-
19/iran-s-un-envoy-says-closing-strait-of-hormuz-is-an-option-if-threatened.html> the Strait of Hormuz, through which 
roughly 20 percent of the world's traded oil flows daily. In another recent act of defiance, Iranian President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad announced <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2012/0215/Iran-loading-homemade-nuclear-fuel-rods-
firing-up-new-centrifuges> on Feb. 15 that a "new generation" of Iranian centrifuges had just been activated at the 
Natanz nuclear site. And this week, IAEA inspectors charged with monitoring Iran's nuclear program were denied access 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-22/former-nuclear-inspectors-advise-against-strike-on-iran-sites.html> to 
a military facility, returning to Vienna after what they termed "disappointing" talks with their Iranian interlocutors. 
Despite its saber-rattling, Iran is feeling the heat of international sanctions. Over the past month, the Iranian rial has 
been devalued <http://www.npr.org/2012/01/26/145863423/growing-pressures-prompt-plunge-in-iranian-currency> 
by 50 percent. Iran has also indicated 
<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204792404577227511864793098.html> that it may even be willing 
to resume diplomacy, which it has scorned since the last round of negotiations in 2009 and 2010. 
With the media rife with speculation <http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-israel-preparing-to-attack-
iran/2012/02/02/gIQANjfTkQ_story.html> about a possible Israeli military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities by this 
summer, tensions between the two countries have risen to an all-time high. Iran is blaming 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/world/middleeast/after-iran-scientists-death-arrests-and-heightened-
security.html> Israel for the recent assassinations of its nuclear scientists, and Israel is accusing 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/world/middleeast/israeli-embassy-officials-attacked-in-india-and-georgia.html> 
Iran of masterminding the Feb. 13 terror attack against Israeli diplomats in New Delhi, as well as attempted attacks in 
Tbilisi and Bangkok. 
It is no secret that Netanyahu and Obama have never been close, but now is the time for the two leaders to find 
common ground over the Iranian nuclear issue. 
There has already been some progress in getting top U.S. and Israeli officials to speak about Iran in similar terms. Last 
week in the Knesset, Netanyahu said <http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=257924> it is 
critical that the world -- not just Israel -- identify "red lines" when dealing with the Iranian nuclear program. In a CBS 
appearance last month, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta declared 
<http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/01/panetta-warning-iran-hormuz.html> that Iran's development of 
a nuclear weapon, as well as closure of the Strait of Hormuz, are "red lines" for the United States. 
However, the United States and Israel clearly differ in where their red lines lie. The United States has put the focus on 
Iran actually gaining a nuclear weapon, while Israel -- more vulnerable to Iranian missiles due to its geographic proximity 
-- views the threshold as the Iranian regime's acquisition of enough low-enriched uranium to build a bomb, pending a 
political decision to convert it to weapons-grade fuel. 
The other set of differences between the United States and Israel has to do with how long they are willing to wait before 
judging the international sanctions of Iran to be a success or failure. On the one hand, this is the first time that the 
United States and the EU have imposed the type of "crippling" sanctions that Israel has long called for. But on the other, 
recent statements <http://www.military.com/news/article/israel-sees-narrowing-window-for-attack-on-iran.html> by 
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak signal that Israel believes its window for military action is rapidly closing. As a result,
