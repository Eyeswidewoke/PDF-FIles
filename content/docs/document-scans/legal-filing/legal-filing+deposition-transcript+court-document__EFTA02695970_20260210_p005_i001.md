When we talked about building roads, there were two key elements of a platform technology: 
• It is a technology that immediately solves problems faced by a significant number of 
constituents 
• It is a technology that is part of a self-reinforcing cycle or ecosystem that gets stronger the more 
people use it for what it is intended 
There is a third element to a platform technology: 
• 
It is a technology that solves problems in the context of constituents in a straight-forward 
manner; and if it requires technologies to be built then those technologies are themselves 
readily available as a bootstrap. 
This third point should also be familiar to us in Windows if you go back to the start of Windows. While it 
would have been possible and interesting to release Windows into a world that required everyone to 
buy a new type of hardware and no longer ran the thousands and thousands of existing MS-DOS 
programs, Windows was a platform technology that was built on an existing ecosystem. In using MS-
DOS as a substrate, Windows was able to take advantage of the tens of millions of PCs that were out 
there and it also continued to run existing programs. While at the same time it met the first criteria of a 
platform by solving problems people had—things like using laser printers (or as a developer, eliminating 
the need to write printer drivers yourself) or moving data between programs (clipboard) to name a few. 
New technology platforms can of course, be built, but that is never a straight-forward path and history 
tends to forget all the failed attempts. 
In a place where there aren't a lot of big buildings, roads, water, or power, there's not a lot of traditional 
infrastructure upon which to build banks. There are, however, mobile phones. In fact, mobile are 
everywhere. Penetration of mobile phones in Somaliland easily rates them as ubiquitous. While worthy 
of a separate post, imagine how much time (and time is the only asset most people have) is saved by 
phones even amongst people working in open air markets. A simple example is whether or not to 
slaughter another animal to sell—without refrigeration you only have a few hours to capitalize on the 
meat so you'd better be right. A simple call to a contact in the market can help you understand demand 
and make the right call. 
Since all transactions have been happening by cash, and everyone has a mobile phone, a "banking 
system" platform needs to be built to take that into account. Additional context would be that most 
people (and businesses) do not have official forms of identity, equivalent of social security cards, street 
addresses, or other means to establish their identity. They do, however, have a mobile phone number 
and for most people that is far more important than any piece of paper and is as much an "identity" as a 
driver's license or passport. 
Africa (Kenya is where this started) is already the home to a major, and innovative, cash based mobile 
banking system called M-Pesa and much has been written about it. It is a sophisticated system 
developed by major international mobile operators, led by Vodafone. M-Pesa provides for peer to peer
