• Brooking Institution: Strategies for people to protect themselves from disinformation — Wednesday, 
September 18, 2024. Location: Brooking Institution, 10:00 AM. Disinformation thrives in a toxic political 
environment that exists not only in the United States but around the world. Falsehoods are made possible by 
rapid advances in digital technology and organized networks that seek to shape national discussions. In their 
new book, "Lies That Kill: A Citizen's Guide to Disinformation," Brookings Senior Fellows Elaine Kamarck and 
Darrell West analyze disinformation using case studies in the areas of election integrity, climate change, 
public health, and race relations. They outline how our political, social, and economic environment makes 
disinformation believable to large numbers of people and easy to disseminate through social media and 
mainstream media outlets while offering solutions to reduce disinformation risks. On September 18, join 
Governance Studies at Brookings for a discussion with Elaine Kamarck and Darrell West about their new 
book, "Lies That Kill." Viewers can submit questions for speakers by emailing events@brookings.edu or via 
Twitter at @BrookingsGov by using #LiesThatKill. 
• Brooking Institution: Mobilizing the market: The barriers to financing a more scalable climate response —
Wednesday, September 18, 2024. Location: Brooking Institution, 2:00 PM. Building a more sustainable and 
resilient American economy will cost trillions of dollars. Despite bold pledges around climate investment and 
the acknowledged need to help more people and places, U.S. public policy is not doing enough to unleash 
private investment to advance critical environmental and social goals. National, state, and local stakeholders 
must realistically confront what's holding back climate investment at the speed and scale the moment 
demands. On September 18, the Brookings Initiative on Climate Research and Action will host a public event 
to explore the challenges and opportunities related to financing a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable 
country. Brookings experts will briefly discuss new research findings released the prior week. Following a 
keynote from Ethan Zindler, the U.S. Treasury Department's Climate Counselor, a panel of national climate 
journalists will dive deeper into the challenges and opportunities to address climate financing gaps. 
• Brooking Institution: On the Front Porch with Tony Pipa: A special Election '24 conversation with Sarah Mills 
about the energy transition in rural America— Wednesday, September 18, 2024. Location: Brooking 
Institution, 4:00 PM. Contemporary differences between rural and urban areas in America have their roots in 
long-term demographic, economic, technological, and social factors. In the "On the Front Porch" series, Tony 
Pipa (Brookings) and Brent Orrell (American Enterprise Institute) sit down with authors of recent research on 
issues facing rural America to explore these factors and more. These conversations seek to unpack the 
unique challenges and opportunities facing rural America and consider policy options to promote prosperity 
and opportunity outside the nation's major metropolitan areas. In "Farming for Wind in Rural Michigan; an 
episode of the Reimagine Rural podcast, Tony Pipa captures the story of the trade-offs and decisions that 
local residents in rural Isabella County, Michigan faced while considering the viability of siting a wind farm in 
their community. This discussion with Sarah Mills, director of the Graham Sustainability Institute's Center for 
EmPowering Communities at the University of Michigan, will use case studies and analysis to explore the 
role that rural places will play as the country transforms its energy infrastructure, how these installations 
affect rural residents and local governments, and how federal and state policy choices can shape those 
impacts. This conversation will be hosted at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan as 
a prelude to the Election 2024 and U.S. Climate Policy event, to be hosted at the Gerald R. Ford School of 
Public Policy from 5-7 p.m. on September 19. Viewers may submit questions via X (Twitter) to 
@BrookingsGlobal using #OntheFrontPorch.
