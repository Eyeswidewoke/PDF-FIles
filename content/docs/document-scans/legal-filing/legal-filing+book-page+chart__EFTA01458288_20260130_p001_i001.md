Special Report: The "Great Accumulation" Is Over: FX Reserves Have Peaked, Beware QT 
The long-term prospect of a more flexible RMB also raises the question of what the 
PBoC would do with the reserves left over from the current drain. Reserves could be 
used increasingly as sovereign wealth rather than for currency managements. The 
FX impact of such a shift in investment objective would likely be bearish EUR/USD. 
The reason is that the transition from liquidity management to the nskireward 
optimization would likely lead to a rebalancing towards equities which, if market 
caps were replicated, would imply a greater portfolio weight on USD. 
The other implication is that greater volatility in the RMB would reinforce the need 
for Asian central banks in particular to hold RMBs to smooth out exchange rate 
volatility vis-à-vis China. Taiwan is just one example of a regional central bank with 
deep pockets. So far, buffer stocks were best invested in USD assets without 
much loss in firepower. As China's dollar peg weakens, USD investments pose an 
increasing misallocation risk. As we have argued before, an Asian reallocation 
toward the RMB would threaten the dollar more than the euro, which accounts for 
negligible shares in Asian reserves. US Treasury yields would rise relative to other 
G5 yields, which could raise private sector inflows to the US helping support the 
USD.

As noted above, a traditional reason to build a war chest of reserves is the 
prospect of excessive capital flight leading to a currency crisis. The expediency of 
holding reserves as a developing country could not be clearer than at present. The 
force of the underlying pressure has so far been understated by official reserve 
draw-down, as central banks' forward books have served as the first line of 
defense. Yet these should soon be depleted, and continuing outflows would 
become an even bigger drain in the coming weeks.

Given the reliance of EM reserves on QE-enabled financial flows since the 2008 
crisis, the speed of reversal should be a key driver of reserves trends going 
forward. EM capital flows have indeed had a strong relationship with G3 central 
bank balance sheet growth with a two-quarter lead (Figure 15), given that market 
pricing anticipates shifts in QE. Projecting G3 balance sheet trends thus offers 
some clues. In our most hawkish scenario, the Fed stops reinvestment by mid-
20t6 and the ECB and BoJ stop QE by September and December 2016, 
respectively. A more dovish scenario might see the Fed reinvesting ad infinitum 
and the ECB and BoJ extending OE purchases until end-2017. 
Worryingly, EM capital flows are already significantly undershooting the projection 
from the hawkish scenario. A constructive take on this would be that EM outflows 
have overreacted and could give way to inflows again as global liquidity conditions
