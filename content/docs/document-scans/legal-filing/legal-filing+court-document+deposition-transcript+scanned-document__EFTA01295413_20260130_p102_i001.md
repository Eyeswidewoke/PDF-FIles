376 III. App. 3d 599, *; 876 N.E.2d 129, **;

remain intact regardless of changes and modifications to the lease. In light of [***23] the 
express provisions of the guaranty, the Swentos were not discharged by the subsequent 
Agreement and CEC was not required to receive a reaffirmation by the Swentos in the 
Agreement to receive the benefit of the original guaranty. See Zirp-Burnham, 356 III. App. 
3d at 605-06. 
The Swentos' second claim, that the Agreement constituted an executory accord that 
satisfied the tenant's obligation under the lease, is also without merit. [HN6] "An 
'executory accord' is an agreement to accept at some future time a stipulated performance 
as satisfaction of an obligation." Collection Professionals, Inc. v. Logan, 296 III. App. 3d 
959, 964, 695 N.E.2d 1344, 231 III. Dec. 225 (1998). [HN7] "[A]n executory accord is 
unenforceable and will not bar enforcement of the original obligation unless: (1) the 
creditor has clearly accepted the new promise of future performance, itself, and not the 
ultimate performance of it, as satisfaction, and (2) the new promise r611] is based upon 
new consideration." Collection Professionals, Inc., 296 III. App. 3d at 964. 
Here, the Agreement specifically provided in paragraph 8 that "Tenant covenants and 
agrees that the Lease is valid, and in full force and effect" and that "the terms and 
provisions of the Lease are hereby ["*"24] ratified, reaffirmed and confirmed." The 
Agreement further provided, in paragraph 2,: 
"Tenant covenants and agrees that the time extensions described in this Paragraph 2 do not and shall not constitute a 
waiver, modification or abrogation of Tenant's obligations under the Lease to timely and fully pay to Landlord all other 
Rent amounts when due during the Term and to otherwise timely and fully perform all covenants and obligations 
described in the Lease during the Term," 
("140] The Agreement therefore did not provide that CEC accepted a new promise of 
future performance as satisfaction for the tenant's obligations under the lease, but, rather, 
the Agreement consisted of an extension of time and modifications of the lease. The 
parties also agreed in the Agreement that the lease remained in full force and effect. In 
addition, any promise to provide a release of the original lease would not have been based 
upon new consideration because Jeepers Illinois already owed the overdue rent payments 
to CEC pursuant to the lease and did not provide new consideration. We therefore 
conclude that there is nothing in the record demonstrating that CEC intended to accept the 
Agreement as satisfaction for the ["**25] tenant's obligations under the lease. 
C. Unconsionability 
The Swentos lastly contend that it is unconscionable to hold them liable under the 
Agreement because they were not parties to the Agreement and had no knowledge of the 
Agreement. Contrary to the Swentos' assertion, the circuit court found them liable pursuant 
to the terms of the personal guaranty, in which they expressly agreed to be jointly and 
severally liable for the tenant's obligations under the lease. GEC's claims in this case were 
based on Jeepers Illinois' failure to make rent payments as obligated under the lease and 
its failure to return the leased premises to the condition required by the lease. As 
previously discussed, the Agreement did not materially alter the obligations of the tenant 
so as to discharge the Swentos from their obligations under the personal guaranty. In 
addition, the personal guaranty granted the landlord the right to make extensions or 
modifications, such as those provided in the Agreement, without impairing the validity of
