2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87203, * 
Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 402, 101 S. Ct. 677, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1981)); 
see also In re Doe, 662 F.2d 1073, 1080 (4th Cir. 1981) (even under crime-fraud exception 
to work product doctrine, party "must show a greater need for the opinion work product 
material than was necessary in order to obtain the fact work product material"). 
The Court finds that Petitioners have not made the strong showing of necessity and 
unavailability required to disclose the mental impressions of counsel that might be at issue 
in this case. (See DE 265 at 16). Discovery r23] of opinion work product is most often 
granted in bad-faith settlement cases, where "mental impressions [of the underlying 
counsel) are the pivotal issue in the current litigation." Holmgren v. State Farm Mut. Auto. 
Ins. Co., 976 F.2d 573, 577 (9th Cir. 1992). Other than by analogizing to bad-faith actions, 
Petitioners have not demonstrated how delving in to the "mental impressions" of 
Government attorneys is pivotal to proving their allegations that the Government failed to 
accord them their rights under the CVRA. (See DE 265 at 15). Insofar as they seek to 
demonstrate that the attorneys' mental impressions should have led them to conclude that 
prosecution was the best course, such inquiry cannot be allowed for reasons discussed 
above. Elsewhere, Petitioners assert that they can prove their case by demonstrating a 
"conspiracy between the Government and defense counsel to deliberately conceal vital 
information from the victims." (DE 266 at 7). Because of the availability of this method of 
proof, Petitioners lack a compelling need to gain access to internal Government work 
product evidencing its internal mental impressions regarding the Epstein matter. 
Finally, Petitioners argue that any work-product protection available in this case should be 
negated because [124] the Government's communications facilitated "misconduct" by 
depriving the victims of their rights under the CVRA. (DE 265 at 6). The Eleventh Circuit 
has recognized that "[t]he crime-fraud exception presents one of the rare and extraordinary 
circumstances in which opinion work product is discoverable." Cox, 17 F.3d at 1422. The 
Eleventh Circuit has not indicated whether this "rare and extraordinary" exception extends 
to instances of "misconduct" in the form of violating a civil rights statute, such as the 
CVRA. Even so, the Court finds that such alleged "misconduct" does not rise to the level of 
conduct that triggers an exception to the work product doctrine. See, e.g., In re Sealed 
Case, 754 F.2d 395, 401, 244 U.S. App. D.C. 11 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (exception to attorney-
client privilege applied where alleged wrongdoing included "perjured testimony, document 
destruction, and similar misconduct"); United States v. Myers, 593 F.3d 338, 347 n.14 (4th 
Cir. 2010) (noting that exception applied where litigant "defrauded" public defender by 
submitting false invoices). Petitioners' allegation that the Government failed to accord them 
their full CVRA rights--the allegation at the heart of this case—does not rise to the level of 
conduct sufficiently serious enough to displace the work product privilege. 
Moreover, Petitioners fail to set forth prima facie evidence ['25] that the Government in 
fact committed "misconduct" in this case. To invoke the crime-fraud exception, the party 
seeking disclosure must (1) make a prima facie showing that the material was produced in 
the commission of criminal or fraudulent conduct and (2) that it was produced "in 
furtherance of the criminal or fraudulent activity or was closely related to it." Cox, 17 F.3d 
at 1416; see also id. at 1422 (noting that same "two-part test" applies in context of both 
attorney client privilege and work product doctrine). Petitioners argue that the fact that the 
OPR "collected information about possible improper behavior" establishes a prima facie 
case of Government misconduct. (DE 265 at 7). An investigation into wrongdoing does not
