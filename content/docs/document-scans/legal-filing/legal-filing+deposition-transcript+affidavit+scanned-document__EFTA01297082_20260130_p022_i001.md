2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79534, * 
Prosser. The first two types of claims were based on "actual fraud," meaning that Trustee 
Carroll bore the burden of proof to show Jeffrey Prosser made transfers to his wife with 
"actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor." 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1)(A) (actual fraud 
provision); In re Valley Bldg. & Constr. Corp., 435 B.R. 276, 285 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2010) 
(stating actual fraud provisions require the trustee to establish the debtor made payments 
with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor). Because "individuals are rarely 
willing to admit intent, actual fraud is rarely proven by direct evidence," In re Pa. Gear 
Corp., Bankr. No. 02-36436, Adv. Nos. 03-940, 03-942, 2008 WL 2370169, at *9 (Bankr. 
E.D. Pa. Apr. 22, 2008). Instead, courts consider various factors, or "badges of fraud," in 
determining whether fraud has been proven by circumstantial evidence. In re Am. Rehab & 
Physical Therapy, Inc., Bankr. No. 04-14562, Adv. No. 04-847, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 1440, 
at *49, [WL], at *15-16 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. May 18, 2006). One such badge of fraud is 
insolvency of the debtor, but not all badges of fraud need to be shown to prove a claim of 
actual fraud. In re Valley Bldg. & Constr. Corp., 435 B.R. at 286 [*10] (detailing 11 badges 
of fraud courts may consider in determining actual intent, not all of which must be proven 
to support a claim of actual fraud, and noting this list is "non-exhaustive"); In re Fedders 
N.Am., Inc., 405 B.R. 527, 545 (Bankr. D. Del. 2009) ("The presence or absence of any 
single badge of fraud is not conclusive." (citation omitted)). Thus, while insolvency of the 
debtor is a factor that may support a claim for actual fraud, it is not an essential element of 
such a claim. The third type of claim brought by Trustee Carroll sought to recover 
unauthorized post-petition transfers from Jeffrey Prosser to his wife, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 
§549, which permits a trustee to avoid transfers of property belonging to the estate that 
occur after the commencement of the case and are not authorized under the Bankruptcy 
Code or by the Bankruptcy Court. 11 U.S.C. § 549(a); see also In re Pa. Gear Corp., 2008 
WL 2370169, at *6. To prevail on this type of claim, a trustee must show that after the 
commencement of the case at issue, property of the estate was transferred, and the 
transfer was not approved by the Bankruptcy Court or any provision of the Code. 11 
U.S.C. § 549; In re PSA, Inc., 335 B.R. 580, 584-85 (Bankr. D. Del. 2005). rig 
Insolvency is thus not a required element for this type of claim either. See In re Kennesaw 
Mint Inc., 32 B.R. 799, 803 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1983) ("Section 549(a) does not require the 
trustee to prove insolvency in order to avoid post-petition transfers."). 
Moreover, the jury instructions for all three claims brought by Trustee Carroll, which were 
agreed upon by all parties in this case, are consistent with this law. See Trial Tr. 158-162, 
June 9, 2011 (instructing jury, as to the first type of fraudulent transfer claim, that 
"[a]Ithough the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor is often difficult to prove by 
direct evidence, certain fact patterns, or badges of fraud, will usually show fraudulent 
intent. When seeking to avoid a fraudulent transfer on the basis of actual fraud, a trustee 
must prove a "goodly" number of badges of fraud. No one particular badge of fraud must 
be proven to demonstrate intent to hinder, delay, or defraud" (and listing various badges of 
fraud, including insolvency of debtor)); id. at 163 (instructing, as to the second type of 
fraudulent transfer claim brought by Trustee Carroll pursuant to United States Virgin 
Islands law, that the jury "must find that [*1 2] transfers were fraudulent if Trustee Carroll 
has proved that Dawn Prosser received or was the beneficiary of certain transfers of 
property of Jeffrey Prosser, and each of those transfers was made with the actual intent to 
hinder, delay, or defraud then present or future creditors"); id at 166 (instructing jury, as to
