The collapse of the global debt markets has pushed all the big companies worldwide to review their plans, expe 
nses and strategies and urged them to restructure their managements including the human resources. "Dubai 
Holding" is not an exception at all. All its companies work on a commercial basis, and it is normal to lay off the 
employees who do not have roles to play during this situation. I am not sure why people are expecting a peak in 
the coming months. The whole process is a restructuring course that was well received by all Dubai Holding 
employees.

lour I lighness, Dubai was accused in the media that laid-off Arabs descend from a specific 
nationality, what is the reality? 
Rumors feed on human emotion. Verifiable facts, and even simple common sense, have little or nothing to do 
with the way a rumor spreads. I would say that due to the steep global crisis effect on domains such as PR and 
advertising, which employ by coincidence a large number from a particular nationality, or the construction sector 
which also employs a large number of architects from one nationality, there is absolutely no focus on laying off 
any Arab or non-Arab nationality.

Your Highness, your recent visit to Russia complements your strategy in visiting the strong 
economic countries worldwide such as Germany and China last year. Do you think that 
these visits are still useful nowadays? Are you planning to20continue this approach and 
what is the objective of those visits? What was the outcome of your last visit to Moscow? 
This is a strange question. We are pretty sure that this crisis will not last forever, and that it will end. The UAE 
has always had good relations with all countries around the world and especially the weighty economic countries. 
Our duty is to work toward developing and enhancing those relationships. In fact, during global crisis countries 
should broaden those visits and enhance their bilateral relations especially since this crisis may result in forming a 
new economic and political world construct.

Your Highness, do you think that the current crisis would impose new changes on the 
federal and local levels in the UAE as rumors are spreading regarding a change in progress 
in the cabinet? 
It is obvious that things do change. Whoever does not take up the new situation and cooperate positively with it 
for the benefit of the nation and nationals would be incompetent. However, it is you who's saying that there are 
rumors that a change in the cabinet is under way.

Your Highness, people who are aware of the relationship between Dubai and Abu Dhabi 
say that there is no need to worry about the effect of the crisis on Dubai because it relies at 
the end of the day on the financial strength of Abu Dhabi, which owns the biggest sovereign 
fund in the world. What would you say?
