Mary Ann Peraccio (Mary Ann), who thereby inherited Thomas' ownership interest both in 
the 2784 premises and the Neptune Avenue premises. 
In 2006, the family members that held interests in the 2784 premises and the Neptune 
Avenue premises agreed to form two limited liability companies (LLCs), i.e., 2784 LLC and 
363-367 Neptune Avenue, LLC (Neptune LLC), to which their respective interests in these 
properties would be transferred, with Ray McRory, Esq. acting as their attorney. On 
November 10, 2006, the operating agreement of 2784 LLC was executed by its initial 
members, who were listed as: Grace (by Burns, as her attorney-in-fact), Julia (by 
Benevento, as her attorney-in-fact), Neary, Salvatore, and Mary Ann. An almost identical 
['..3] operating agreement of Neptune LLC was also executed by these members on the 
same date. The members conveyed their interests in the 2784 premises to 2784 LLC and 
their interests in the Neptune Avenue premises to Neptune LLC. Pursuant to the operating 
agreements, Burns was named the manager of both LLCs. 
Thereafter, John died on March 28, 2007 and his estate passed to Carmel Salerno, 
Patricia Judice, Joanne Judice Rafaella, and Salvatore Judice (Judice). The estate of John 
conveyed its interests in the 2784 premises and the Neptune Avenue premises ['"871] to 
the two LLCs. Lucy Judice died without having children, and her estate conveyed its 
interest in the 2784 premises and the Neptune Avenue premises to the two LLCs. To 
reflect these changes, on November 1, 2007, an amended and restated operating 
agreement for 2784 LLC was executed by all of the initial members, and by the estate of 
John (by Judice, as the executor), as a new member. Schedule A to 2784 LLC's operating 
agreement (annexed as exhibit 2 to Bums' motion ["284] papers) lists the voting 
percentage interests of its members as being: 44.8% for the estate of John, 18.4% for 
Grace, 18.4% for Julia, and 18.4% for the Neary group, consisting [•""4] of three listed 
members, i.e., Neary, Salvatore, and Mary Ann. At some time prior to 2011, Julia died, and 
her estate passed to her two sons, Benevento and Anthony Benevento (Anthony), in equal 
shares, pursuant to a will which also named them as co-executors. 
In April 2009, members of Neptune LLC were requested to vote on a proposal to sell the 
Neptune Avenue premises. Benevento (on behalf of the estate of Julia) and Neary voted 
no to this proposal. By a letter dated April 21, 2009, the members of Neptune LLC were 
informed that on April 20, 2009, 73.3% of the Neptune LLC's membership had voted in 
favor of this proposal, and that, as a result, Burns was authorized to sell the Neptune 
Avenue premises at the highest and best price possible and to take any necessary steps 
to do so, including vacating all tenants from such premises. 
In September 2009, Burns, on behalf of 2784 LLC, executed a purchase agreement to sell 
the 2784 premises to M & A Realty Services, LLC for a sales price of $1,050,000. In 2010, 
the 2784 premises were sold with the purchase price for this sale paid in cash and by a 
purchase money mortgage. Prior to the sale, 2784 LLC's members signed a Certificate of 
Members of 2784 ["""5] LLC Resolution to Sell Real Property (the certificate) in 
accordance with section 3.4 of the operating agreement, which required that the manager 
have prior written approval of a majority vote of all members in order to sell the 2784 
premises. The certificate was signed by the estate of John (by Judice), Grace (by Bums, 
as her attorney-in-fact), the estate of Julia (by Anthony), and the Neary group (by Mary 
Ann, as the authorized representative), and reflected their respective interests in 2784 LLC
