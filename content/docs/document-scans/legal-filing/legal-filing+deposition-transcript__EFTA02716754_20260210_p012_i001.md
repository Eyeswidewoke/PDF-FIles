The sprawling camp has become a major embarrassment, and a potent emblem of Silicon Valley's homeless crisis. In 
2013, San J=se and the surrounding Santa Clara County estimated almost 7,600 homeless people, more than in San 
Franc=sco. And 75% of them were sleeping outside, on sidewalks, in parks and under freeway embankments — a 
percentage=greater than in any other major U.S. metropolitan area. Officials have blamed soaring housing costs for the 
displacement. As =ilicon Valley rocketed out of the recession, workers streamed in, driving the average apartment rent 
within 1= miles of San Jose up to $2,633 in September, from $1,761 two years earlier, according to the rental website 
RentJungle.com and the median home price is nearly $700,000. 
"The city really made a good-faith effort," said Claire Wagner, communications director for HomeFirst, which runs a 
homeless shelter and services agency in San Jose. But while 144 inhabitants have found housing, more than 50 have 
rent subsidies in han= but nowhere to go. In 2011, the state ended special redevelopment assessments, which 
essentially brought affordab=e housing construction to a halt, said Ray Bramson, San Jose's homelessne=s response 
manager. "Encampments are not the problem, homelessn=ss is the problem," Bramson said. "If you have 10 
applications=to choose from, nine with stable rental histories and work, and you have somebody liv=ng in a creek; what 
are you going to do?" Loving added. Last week, some inhabitants of the Jungle were packing up to leave while others 
said they planned to remain as long as possible. San Jose poli=e and city officials hand out notices warning residents of 
the homeless encampment known as the Jungle th=t they must vacate the premises.

As today's students face a world filled w=th global conflict, disappearing jobs, skyrocketing education costs, and 
increasing poverty in America, action is more crucial than ever. We know hunger and homeles=ness are increasing 
epidemics plaguing the United States — striking Americans of every =ge, ethnicity, and religion, hitting urban and rural 
communities alike. J=st last year, the national poverty rate rose to include 13.2% of the population. 1 in 7 people were 
at risk of suffering from hunger in the United States. In addit=on, 3.5 million people were forced to sleep in parks, under 
bridges, in shelter=or cars. The combination of the high cost of living, low-wage jobs, and high unemployment rates only 
exacerbate these problems and force countless Americans to choose between food, housing, and other expenses. 
Studies show that money devoted to food is typically the first to be sacrificed. Families will ofte= pay their fixed 
payments first, such as rent and utilities, rather than pay=for food. Unfortunately, these problems will only continue to 
grow if our society does not make it a national priority t= address them in any systemic way. 
The homeless population includes people from al= walks of life: 
In the U.S., more than 3.5 million people experience homelessness each year. 
• 
35% of the homeless population are families with children, which is the fastest growing segment of the 
homeless population.
