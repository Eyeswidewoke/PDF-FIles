(including biof=els) and become the second largest global producer by the end of the year.=The U.S. even could surpass 
Saudi Arabia to become the leading global producer within the next decade. 
At the same time, t=e rise of oil-displacement technologies is creating an unprecedented oppor=unity to reduce U.S. oil 
consumption in the transportation sector. Electri=ity and natural gas are both cheap and domestically abundant. There 
are now nearly 20 plug-in electric passen=er vehicle models—from nearly every major auto maker—available to 
U.S.=consumers. Hundreds of commercial and municipal fleet operators around the=country have integrated natural-gas 
trucks and buses into their fleets, and dozens of models are available in =early all fleet applications, from transit to 
refuse hauling. The nation's=fleet of internal-combustion-engine vehicles has made great strides in imp=oved fuel 
efficiency, and further improvements will be achieved over the next decade. 
These changes creat= the possibility of dramatic improvements to the security of America's oil=supply with significant 
benefits for economic growth and national security= Yet our ability to capture such advantages is not a foregone 
conclusion. 
Fully maximizing th= opportunities presented by the American energy revolution will require a =oncerted national effort 
that prioritizes investment in the development of=advanced energy technologies—such as low-cost advanced batteries 
for electric vehicles and more-efficient home =efueling units for natural gas vehicles—along with continued growth in 
d=mestic energy production. The volatility of oil prices, the presence of an=icompetitive forces like OPEC, and the 
political and fiscal risks to significant and sustained energy-related=research and development create an acute need for 
strong leadership from W=shington if we are to capitalize on this moment. 
Yet important philo=ophical differences now divide the major political parties on energy and e=vironmental policies. 
Pretending such differences do not exist, or dismiss=ng them as petty politics, defies reality and prevents progress on 
the pressing challenge of oil security. <1=> 
To move forward, we=suggest establishing oil displacement as a national goal. Such a target wo=ld advance the goals of 
robust economic growth, improved environmental pro=ection and effective foreign policy. Best of all, a national 
consensus on reducing oil dependence should be pos=ible without the resolution of the energy and environmental 
issues that wi=l continue to be debated for some time. 
OPEC's intervention=in the global oil market creates price distortions that have cost the Amer=can economy trillions of 
dollars and stymied the very innovation required =o develop competing technologies. OPEC operates as a cartel of 
governments, and the U.S. should not accept this c=ndition as permanent. An American government policy response to 
counter OP=C's market manipulation would be in support of the free market. Preserving=the current system only 
perpetuates a tax on American consumers imposed by foreign powers. 
Meanwhile, replacin= oil in the transportation sector by unleashing competition now shackled b= OPEC's price 
manipulation would reduce pollution significantly. Petroleum=fuels also account for a larger share of America's energy-
related carbon-dioxide emission than any other fuel. F=r these reasons, the wide-scale adoption of alternative-fuel 
vehicles powe=ed by natural gas, electricity and other fuels—or a flexible fuel combin=tion—would represent a major 
environmental achievement. 
Finally, as the U.S= confronts an increasingly complex foreign-policy landscape, meaningfully =educing oil dependence 
would allow the nation to set priorities with far l=ss regard for the consequences of global supply interruptions. For 
realists and idealists alike, such independence =olds tremendous value as the country contends with a fragmenting 
Middle Ea=t, an unstable North Africa, and a contentious Russia, among other challen=es. 
Since 1973, OPEC's =quot;oil weapon" has dangled ominously over the U.S. While America re=ains dangerously exposed 
to changes in the price and supply of oil, our na=ion has never been better positioned to diminish the clout of cartel 
participants in the global oil market. We urge the nat=on's leaders to embrace both the supply revolution now well
