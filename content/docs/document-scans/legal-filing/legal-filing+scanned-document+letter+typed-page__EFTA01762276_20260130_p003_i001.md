In a press conferen=e held on Sunday, Issa Qaraqi, the PA's minister of detainees, said that=Palestinians would continue 
to protest until Israel responds to the detain=es' demands. Qaraqi called for an international committee to investigate 
the death of Jaradat, whom he said had no prior h=alth issues. He also warned: "The situation is already explosive 
because=of the four Palestinians on hunger strike. Palestinians on the street and =nside the prisons are seething with 
anger." 
The PA is trying to=tow a fine line: using the specter of a third intifada to put pressur= on Israel while doing much to 
placate its fears by reiterating that it wi=I not tolerate any armed methods of resistance. That's why the PA was quick to 
dispel rumors — and Israeli allegations=— that it was stoking the protests. Senior Fatah official Jibril Rajoub =aid PA-Israeli 
security cooperation would continue. "I say on behalf of =he entire Palestinian leadership that we won't initiate any 
bloodshed," he told Israel Radio <http://www.timesofisrael.com=third-intifada-is-already-raging-pa-officials-sayk , 
while echoing Abbas' statement vis-à-vis Pale=tinians' right to "nonviolent resistance." 
While comparisons a=e being made between the first and second intifadas to draw conclusions ab=ut a possible third 
one, it is worth noting that the frequency of West Ban= clashes is a marked reflection of frustration with the PA's 
inability to change the status quo. If anythin=, the PA is being seen as a contributor to the current situation; A few da=s 
ago PA forces were deployed (as they have been on and off in recent prot=sts) to act as a buffer between demonstrators 
and Israeli soldiers in Hebron. 
Settler violence ha= also been playing a central role in the hostilities as the number of inci=ents of vandalism, tree 
torching, car destruction and racist graffiti-draw=ng skyrocketed. On Saturday, many settlers, some armed with guns, 
attacked Palestinians in Qusra near the northern Wes= Bank city of Nablus, uprooting residents' trees and torching their 
cars= Several Palestinians were wounded by live rounds, one of whom is now in critical condition 
chttp://www.reuters.com/article/2013/O2/23/us-palestinians-israel=idUSBRE91M09Q20130223> and has been 
transferred to Is=ael for further treatment. 
In summary, it seem= the PA wants to use this new potential intifada to coax conciliation from=lsrael, such as paying 
money owed to it from taxes, or to nudge it into sore kind of move that would placate its angry streets. It may also be 
using this as an incentive to U.S. President=Barack Obama — visiting the region in March — to push forward his own 
=Ian or outline for a permanent peace agreement. 
Israel may be fearf=l that an intifada would take them back in time; Netanyahu has repeatedly =roven himself more 
concerned with maintaining the status quo wherein Pales=inians don't play a major role in the national popular psyche. 
The last elections proved that Palestinians were =arely an afterthought to many Israeli voters and he would much rather 
keep=the focus on Iran (and Syria) any day of the week than have to deal with t=e Palestinians next door.
