taxable year consists of PHC income (which includes, among other things, dividends, interest, certain royalties, 
annuities and, under certain circumstances, rents). 
Depending on the date and size of our initial business combination, at least 60% of our adjust'ed ordinary 
gross income may consist of PHC income as discussed above. In addition, depending on the concentration of our 
stock in the hands of individuals, including the members of our sponsor and certain tax-exempt organizations, 
pension funds and charitable trusts, more than 50% of our stock may be owned or deemed owned (pursuant to the 
constructive ownership rules) by such persons during the last half of a taxable year. Thus, no assurance can be 
given that we will not become a PHC following this offering or in the future. If we are or were to become a PlIC 
in a given taxable year, we would be subject to an additional PHC tax, cummtly 20%, on our undistributed PHC 
income, which generally includes our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. We believe that both of the 
PHC requirements will apply to us in the taxable year of the offering and that it is possible that the PHC 
requirements will apply to us in future taxable years 
Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit 
No statutory. administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments 
similar to a unit for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear. The 
acquisition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the acquisition of one share of our 
common stock and one warrant to acquire one-half of one share of our common stock. We intend to treat the 
acquisition of a unit in this manner and, by purchasing a unit, you will agree to adopt such treatment for tax 
purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by 
such holder for such unit between the one ordinary share and the warrant based on the relative fair market value of 
each at the time of issuance. The price allocated to each share of common stock and the warrant should be the 
shareholder's tax basis in such share or warrant, as the case may be. Any disposition of a unit should be treated 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the share of common stock and one warrant comprising 
the unit, and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the ordinary share and warrant 
based on their respective relative fair market values. The separation of the share of common stock and the warrant 
comprising a unit should not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
The foregoing treatment of the shares of common stock and warrants and a holder's purchase price allocation 
are not binding on the IRS or the courts. Because there are no authorities that directly address instruments that are 
similar to the units. no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will agree with the characterization 
described above or the discussion below. Accordingly, each prospective investor is urged to consult its own tax 
advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in a unit (including alternative characterizations of a 
unit). The balance of this discussion assumes that the characterization of the units described above is respected for 
U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
U.S. Holders 
This section applies to you if you are a "U.S. holder.- A U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of our units. shares 
of common stock or warrants who or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: 
• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 
• a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized in or 
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia. or 
• an estate or trust the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes 
regardless of its source.

Taxation of Distributions. If we pay cash distributions to U.S. holders of shares of our common stock, such 
distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our 
current or accumulated earnings and profits, as detemrined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions 
in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied 
against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in our common stock. Any remaining 
excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the common stock and will be treated as 
described under -U.S. holders—Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of 
Common Stock" below. 
Dividends we pay to a U.S. holder that is a taxable corporation generally will qualify for the dividends 
received deduction if the requisite holding period is satisfied. With certain exceptions (including, but not limited 
to, dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment interest deduction limitations), and 
provide) certain holding period requirements are met, dividends we pay to a non-corporate U.S. holder generally
