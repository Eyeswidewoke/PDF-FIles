Li Trade Idea: Buy Upside on SX7E (Eurostoxx Banks Index) as ECB gradually starts shifting stance 
Paul — below is something we put together more widely here but contains a couple of prices highlighted in 
yellow. 
We are still working on the restructure of your existing note and will be back soon.
At the last ECB press conference, Mario Draghi raised the issue of the structural profitability of the banking system and 
the potential for a shift in ECB thinking on the cost of negative rates. We think that one solution they could potentially 
look at is a tiered reserve system which would be a huge positive for the banks. The negative interest rate policy is a 
huge negative for the sector (banks cannot pass on the costs to households and weighted margins have fallen 45% since 
the crisis). Click here for a note with an update on how ECB thinking on this issue is shifting. (the links are to research 
published prior to today's press conference by Draghi). 
At today's press conference, Draghi acknowledged that although discussed by the members of the ECB, they "didn't 
discuss policy or policy implications this time." That basically means that there is no announcement on this as of today 
and as a result SX7E dropped 1% right after the conference. Having said that, the risk-reward is shifting for the index to 
staying more or less unchanged with upside potential on this upcoming likely change over the next few months. 
Trade Idea: Earn 11.5% coupon paid at maturity by buying a 1-year structured note that gives you downside principal 
protection down to 75% of initial level AND pays you a coupon as long as the index stays above 85% of initial level 
(meaning the SX7E can go down 14.99% from initial level and you still get your coupon. If the index drops less than 
25%, you get your principal back). 
Alternative you asked about our call: if you have the redemption barrier at 75% and the coupon barrier at 75% as 
well, and the coupon was paid quarterly, it would be around 8%. 
There is a recorded analyst call from yesterday titled: "Potential Game Changer for the Banks?" with the below agenda 
and replay number if you'd like to listen to more analysis:

Why now? 
• 
In the December meeting Draghi FINALLY said banks profitability is an issue 
• 
Since then the funding market has been trickier for banks. (KBC calling AT1s due to funding costs increased this 
year) 
• 
Ref i needs are high this year, especially given MREL forcing more funding requirements (NPS bonds) 
• 
The TLTRO 3 needs to be implemented in June. (you may as well roll your banks package in whilst you are 
helping the Italian banks again)
