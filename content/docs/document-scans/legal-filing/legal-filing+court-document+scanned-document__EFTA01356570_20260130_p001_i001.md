2. Upon submission, the lead record will route to Business Manager for approval. The Business Manager must 
obtain and attach a number of approvals prior to approving in DB Force: 
o Regional Business Head or their delegate 
o 
EMEA legal AND compliance (US Compliance will be responsible for obtaining these approvals) 
3. If the non-target request is rejected, the Regional Business Head may challenge the decision by escalating 
to Patrick Campion. 
4. Once Business Manager approves, the lead is routed to 68O, who must ensure that all required approvals 
are attached to the non-target lead request prior to their approval. 
EEA Client Declaration Form 
http://americas.awm.intranet.db.comien/html/56462.php 
1. All EEA Clients (excluding Germany) must sign the EEA Client Declaration form as evidence of non-
solicitation. Once the client provides the signed form, their banker must also sign. 
2. If the client is a pre-existing client, and the new EEA Lead/Prospect approvals were not gathered for this 
particular account opening in the previous step, they must now be completed. Business Manager should 
only sign once ALL approvals have been obtained. 
3. Once completed, the EEA client declaration form must be attached within the account opening process and 
routed, with the other account opening documents, to the Account Opening Review Group for review. 
4. The Account Opening Review Group must ensure that the form is signed by the client, the Relationship 
Manager, and the Business Manger. If the form is incomplete, the account opening requrest must be 
rejected, and the case sent back to the Relationship Manager for completion. 
IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING EEA-UK Brokerage Accounts: 
In order for ISG to service brokerage accounts for a UK client, one of the following must apply: 
1. Entity Account Holder meets the UK High Net Worth Company (HNWC) Exemption criteria as reflected on the 
High Net Worth Company Assessment & Declaration form ("HNWC Exemption form"); or 
2. Exception approval was granted and is attached with account opening documents (for Entities which do not meet 
HNWC Exemption criteria, or for Individual accounts). 
NOTE: For Entity clients meeting HNWC Exemption, Financial Promotions must come from ISG Investment 
Specialists only and a Financial Promotion Disclosure Letter must be attached. 
How to process UK HNWC Exemption Forms 
Once all required intemal signatures are obtained, the form must be imaged to the client's record. As the client's UK 
HNWC Exemption status must be re-assessed annually, a new form will be required each year. Storing the form in 
dbForce will enable future identification of forms which are expiring and require update. 
Please follow these steps to add the form to dbForce: 
i. 
If a new account, HNWC Exemption form must be attached with all account opening dots
