Annual EFT Error Resolution Notice 
This notice is to inform you about how you should notify us of errors or questions regarding any electronic fund 
transfers you initiate using your American Express Card, including Express Cash transactions, or electronic 
payments you make to American Express using Pay By Phone, Pay By Computer, or any other American 
Express electronic payment service. 
In case of errors or questions about your Electronic Transfers, please contact us as soon as you can if you think 
your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or 
receipt. You can telephone us at 1-800-IPAY-AXP for Pay By Phone and Pay By Computer questions, and at 
1-800-CASH-NOW for Express Cash and Automatic Payment questions. Alternatively, you may write to us at 
American Express, Electronic Funds Services, P.O. Box 981531, El Paso, TX 79998.1531, or contact us online 
at www.americanexpress.com/inquirycenter. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the 
FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared or question arose. 
When you contact us, please provide the following information: 
(1) Your name and card account number. 
(2) Description of the error or the transfer you are unsure about. Explain as clearly as you can why you believe it 
is an error or why you need more information. 
(3) The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
If you notify us by phone, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 
business days of the call. 
We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days and will correct any error promptly. If we 
need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to 
do this, we will credit your bank account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you 
will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your 
complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your 
account. 
For errors involving point-of-sale or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your 
complaint or question. 
We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there 
was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in 
our investigation. 
If we have credited your bank account and there was no error, we will tell you when we will withdraw that amount 
from your bank account again. You authorize us to withdraw this amount from your bank account. If your bank 
account does not have enough funds to cover this withdrawal, we can charge the amount to your card account or 
collect the amount from you. If this happens, we may cancel your right to use our electronic transfer services. 
Notice for residents of Washington State 
In accordance with the Revised Code of Washington Statutes. Section 63.14.167. you are not responsible for 
payment of interest charges that result solely from a merchant's failure to transmit to us within seven working 
days a credit for goods or services accepted for return or forgiven if you have notified us of the merchant's delay 
in posting such credit, or our failure to post such credit to your account within three working days of our receipt of 
the credit.
