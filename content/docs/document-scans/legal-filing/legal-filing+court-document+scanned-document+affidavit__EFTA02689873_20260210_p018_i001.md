(A) 
units or shares of funds if such funds are subject to risk diversification requirements 
comparable to those set out in the CSSF circular 07/309; 
(B) 
securities issued or guaranteed by a Member State of the OECD or by its local authority or by 
supranational institutions and organisations with European, regional or worldwide scope; 
(iii) 
Each compartment of a target fund with multiple compartments is considered as a distinct target fund 
for the purpose of the Investment Restrictions and limits set out under Sections 3.4(i) and (ii) above 
provided that the principle of segregation of the assets and liabilities of the different compartments is 
ensured; 
Borrowing 
(iv) 
each Compartment may borrow permanently (through loans, repurchase obligations or otherwise either 
directly or at the level of any Intermediary Vehicle) and for investment purposes, to meet funding 
Commitments in underlying Investments or for working capital purposes, and secure those borrowings 
with liens or other security interests in, or mortgages on, its assets (or the assets of any of its 
Intermediary Vehicles). The borrowing limit applicable to each Compartment will be as set out in the 
relevant Special Section; 
(v) 
for the avoidance of doubt, the leverage limitation applies set out in each Special Section in accordance 
with Section 3.4(iv) above only on the date the debt is incurred. It shall not be an on-going obligation 
of the Compartment to meet this constraint by reducing its existing indebtedness as a result of a decline 
in the value of any of its existing Investments; 
Investment through Intermediary Vehicles 
(vi) 
Investments may be made by the Compartments through Intermediary Vehicles. The Company will seek 
to fully control any such Intermediary Vehicles, but may also hold Investments through joint ventures 
where the Company will seek to retain control over the management, sale, and financing of the venture's 
assets or alternatively will have a viable mechanism for exiting the venture, within a reasonable period 
of time. 
(vii) 
an Investment into an Intermediary Vehicle should be ignored for the purpose of the above Investment 
Restrictions and the underlying investments of the Intermediary Vehicle should be treated as if they 
were direct investments made by the Company. 
Kick-off Period 
(viii) 
The Investment restrictions of this Section 3 may not be complied with during the Kick-off Period, i.e. 
during a transitional period as will be set out in respect of each Compartment in that Compartment's 
Special Section, provided that the General Partner will endeavour to ensure, at all times, an appropriate 
level of diversification of risk within the portfolio of the Compartments.
