containing a foiled circle supported on two smaller arches; at Amiens, an arch containing a foiled circle supported 
on two smaller arches, each containing a still-smaller foiled circle supported on still-smaller arches. 
Exactly the same transition connects the windows of the apse and those of the nave in the chapel of Saint-Germain-
en-Laye, dating from the late 1230s. 
Tracery recursion can go deeper, too. The great east window at Lincoln Cathedral dates from around 1275. (Most 
English medieval churches terminate not in curved chevets but in flat eastern walls—ideal places for spectacular 
windows.) Within a large arch is a circle supported between two smaller arches. Within each smaller arch, a circle 
supported between two still-smaller arches. Within each still-smaller arch, a circle supported between two 
even-smaller arches. The result is an enormous "eight-light window," with a row of eight lancets forming the bottom 
register. 
As reconstructed by Edmund Sharpe in his still-unrivaled (and unreprinted) study of English tracery (1849), the 
great east window at the wins of Tintern Abbey used a similar, although somewhat more venturesome, design, 
yielding again an eight-light window. (This is Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey, by the way.) At Le Mans Cathedral is 
another recursive eight-light window, which plays on recursion not only in the arrangement of each window and 
sub-window but in the decorative devices in the upper registers. 
The celebrated Percy tomb (circa 1240) at Beverley Minster near York is another example of three-level recursion. 
The carved stone canopy of the tomb centers on a large ogee arch—two S-curves joined at a point on top. Within 
this ogee arch, three smaller ones; within each smaller arch, another even smaller. 
Gothic architecture is often playful, and Gothic designers played with recursion. The chapel windows at Amiens, 
echoed in the apse windows at the Sainte-Chapelle, culminate in a pyramid of trefoils--a trefoil is a circle 
surrounded by three equally spaced part-circles, or (occasionally) just three plain circles arranged like a clover leaf. 
each touching the other two. (Sainte-Chapelle, which dates from the 1240s, was the royal chapel of King Louis IX of 
France, otherwise Saint Louis.) 
The trefoil itself often occurs in recursive versions, where each lobe has two-thirds of a smaller trefoil inscribed 
inside--as, for example, on the facade of Strasbourg Cathedral. But in the Amiens and Sainte Chapelle windows, 
three simple trefoils are arranged not within a larger trefoil but in the shape of one—as if the large trefoil had been 
used as a temporary frame to rack up the small ones like billiard balls. 
There is an even closer approach to this theme at Lichfield Cathedral, unsurprisingly--for Amiens inspired Sainte-
Chapelle, which introduced the "spherical triangle." which was copied at Westminster Abbey, which inspired 
Lichfield. The sides of a spherical triangle are gracefully convex, as if they had been drawn on a sphere. The 
Sainte-Chapelle, Westminster Abbey, and Lichfield all have spherical-triangular windows, but the most beautiful are 
at Lichfield (ca. 1265), where the triangle frames a trefoil of trefoils. 
Recursion is especially important to English tracery of the Perpendicular period. The Perpendicular style, which 
emerged at London and Gloucester in the 1330s, is "late Gothic" and unique to England—a style that combines 
dazzling virtuosity (on occasion) with a certain decorum and prickly restraint. The relation between recursion and 
Perpendicular design is a story in itself, but a window from the church of St. Mary Magdalen in Launceston. 
Cornwall, is a simple example. It is an arch with an elongated diamond in the center flanked by two other diamonds. 
Superimposed is a Y-shaped mullion that creates two smaller arches--each with an elongated diamond on top, 
flanked by two others. 
Recursive structure occurs in rose windows, too--and helps us see a distinction we might otherwise miss. The great 
western rose at Reims, for example, is a 12-petaled flower containing an inner 12-petaled flower within a 
medium-sized 24-petaled flower. It's tempting to approach in the same way some of the older roses that predate 
tracery: The north rose at Laon, for example, is an 8-petaled flower surrounded by smaller 8-petaled flowers: the 
west rose at Chartres is a 12-petaled flower surrounded by (again) smaller 8-petaled flowers. 
When we look at these roses from inside, it's impossible not to see a resemblance between their festive, abstract
