the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and 
thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a 
closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount 
of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be 
met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public "float" of our common stock may be reduced and the 
number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain 
the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with 
whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the 
stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following 
our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, 
officers, directors. advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase. they would identify and contact only 
potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shams for a pm rata share of the 
trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates 
will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other 
federal securities laws. 
My purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under 
Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in 
compliance with Rule lOb-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(aX2) and 
Rule 106-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in 
order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will 
not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule lob-5 of the 
Exchange Act.

Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of 
common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-sham price, payable in cash, equal 
to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of 
the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the 
number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust 
account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will 
distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferral undenvriting 
commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholder, officers, directors and director nominees 
have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights 
with respect to their founder shares and public shams in connection with the completion of our initial business 
combination. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shams of 
common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder 
meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether 
we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by 
us. solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and 
whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock 
exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder 
approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue 
more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation would require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote 
pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange 
listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other 
legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
• conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule I 3e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate 
issuer tender offers, and 
• file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which 
contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the
