The 1970s witnessed=a profound and unprecedented transfer of wealth to the Middle East that co=tinues to have 
significant repercussions today -- from democracy movements=to terrorism to civil wars. The region's leaders failed to 
set up long-term mechanisms to distribute the benefits o= that wealth transfer broadly to their populations and to 
establish an equ=table stake in governance of resource proceeds that would have brought a n=wfound stability to the 
region. Instead, they bought lavishly, gilding their palaces and buying fleets of =uxury autos. For decades, they 
squandered the opportunity to use oil wealt= to modernize their societies and train their populations for future globa= 
economic competition. The result -- unfolding not just in the Middle East but in other oil-producing countr=es as well --
is a crisis of governance that is itself triggering a round =f oil-supply disruptions. 
Massive petrodollar=inflows brought with them a new po=itical paradigm of "re=tier" patronage, characterized by 
financial excesses, corruption, rep=ession, and billions of dollars in accumulated weapons purchases. Populations of oil-
producing states, for the most part,=are little better off today than in 1973. Many of the countries have been =ar-
ravaged or riven by sectarian hatreds. And, even with decades of relati=ely high oil prices and associated worker 
remittances, most countries of the Middle East still see modest GDP per c=pita, below 530,000 person =n a purchasing-
power-parity basis. 
Deep income inequal=ty means that much of the region's population is in fact still living in p=verty, even in places like 
Saudi Arabia. So it should be no surprise that =0 years after the 1973 embargo, citizens of the region are rising up against 
those who squandered their futures. Ti=ed of waiting for the day when rising oil revenues would somehow 
magically=bring back the promise of prosperity, youth =re taking to the street=; port a=d oil workers are mounti=g 
strikes; and jihadists ar= taking up arms to end the oil curse once and for all. Their frustrations =o not unfold in a 
vacuum. High oil prices associated with all this unrest is propelling energy investment elsewhere =o great success. 
Energy efficiency is also getting a boost, shrinking the =ong-term market for Middle East oil. The upshot will be that it 
will be harder and harder over time for Arab rulers to count on oil money to keep them in power. And that has a 
trickle=down effect to the populations they've been keeping quiescent with handout= for decades. 
Ironically, just wh=n political revolutions were gaining momentum across the Middle East, a di=ferent kind of revolution 
was emerging that looks likely to bring a new ep=ch of dislocation and distortion to prevailing oil and gas structures. This 
second energy revolution is also a=eliorating the impact of the first. 
Since January 2011,=at the dawn of the rebellions against dictatorial governments in North Afr=ca, the amount of oil 
"offline" or being blocked from production=by either domestic turmoil (in Iraq, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria, Yemen) or 
international sanctions (in Iran) has generally be=n above 2 million barrels per day (m b/d), four times the average level 
of=supply outages before the so-called Arab Spring. Then Libya erupted once a=ain this past summer, taking another 1.2 
m b/d, or more, offline. But the impact of these disruptions has been relatively mild, given that over the same period, 
production in North Ameri=a, the heartland of the three revolutionary changes in unconventional hydr=carbon 
production (shale, deep water, and oil sands), has grown by more than 2.5 m b/d. And more is on th= way. 
Growth in renewable=energy has also been=significant in recent years=in the United States and beyond, and rising fossil 
fuel costs and strong g=vernment intervention have created new market opportunities. World biofuels production has 
doubled to over 1.2 m =/d since 2006, but wind power has grown in oil-equivalent terms from 1 m b=d to 2 m b/d since 
2008 (and is accelerating at about a 20 percent annuali=ed clip). Solar power, meanwhile, grew from 20,000 b/d of oil-
equivalent energy in 2008 to 400,000 b/d last =ear. 
But the impact of a=l this change in the energy world will go far beyond just replacing contin=ing Arab Spring outages. 
Unconventional oil and gas and the clean-tech boo=s are spawning a host of new, smaller oil and gas exploration 
companies committed to innovation and willing to t=ke on risk. They have no stake in the multibillion-dollar 
megaproject worl= of the international majors and national oil companies, and as such, they=have fewer concerns about 
sustaining high profits from giant assets found decades ago. They are enabling the Un=ted States the opportunity to take 
a lead in changing the way energy is bo=ght and sold -- not just in the United States, but globally.
