Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes, only a non-U.S. holder who, actually or constructively, 
holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder's holding period) more 
than 5% of our common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on any gain derived from the disposition of our common 
stock. 
Federal Estate Tax 
Common stock held (or deemed held) at the time of death by an individual non-U.S. holder who is neither a citizen or resident of 
the United States (as specifically defined for United States estate tax purposes) will be included in such holders gross estate for United 
States federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
We must report annually to the Internal Revenue Service and to each non-U.S. holder the amount of dividends paid to such holder 
and the tax withheld with respect to such dividends, regardless of whether withholding was required. Copies of the information returns 
reporting such dividends and withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder 
resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. 
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to backup withholding for dividends paid to such holder unless such holder certifies under penalty 
of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder, or such holder otherwise establishes an exemption. 
Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds of a disposition of our 
common stock within the United States or conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless the beneficial 
owner certifies under penalty of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder, or such owner otherwise establishes an exemption. 
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund 
or a credit against a non-U.S. holder's United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to 
the Internal Revenue Service. 
Additional Withholding Requirements 
Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as "FATCA"), a 30% United States federal 
withholding tax may apply to any dividends paid on our common stock and, for a disposition of our common stock occurring after 
December 31, 2016, the gross proceeds from such disposition, in each case paid to (i) a 'foreign financial institution- (as specifically 
defined in the Code), whether such foreign financial institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary, which does not provide 
sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or 
deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of compliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the 
United States) in a manner which avoids withholding, or (ii) a "non-financial foreign entity" (as specifically defined in the Code), whether 
such non-financial foreign entity is the beneficial owner or an intermediary, which does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on 
IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United 
States beneficial owners of such entity (if any). If a dividend payment is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the 
withholding tax discussed above under "—Dividends,' the withholding under FATCA may be credited against, and therefore reduce, such 
other withholding tax. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding these requirements and whether they may be relevant to your 
purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock.
