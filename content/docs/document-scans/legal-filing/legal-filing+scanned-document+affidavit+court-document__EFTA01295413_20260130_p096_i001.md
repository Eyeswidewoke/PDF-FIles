376 III. App. 3d 599, *; 876 N.E.2d 129, **; 
2007 III. App. LEXIS 962, ***; 315 III. Dec. 129 
tenant's proportionate share, as defined in the lease. Pursuant to ['6O3] the amendment, 
all other terms of the lease remained the same. The second amendment also contained 
the same paragraph as the first amendment, in which the Swentos "reaffirmed their 
obligation under that certain Personal Guaranty dated as of July 8, 1991, in favor of 
Landlord." 
Also on January 24, 1992, the Swentos transferred all interest in their business, Swento & 
Company, Inc., to a new entity also operated by them, Family Fun Enterprises, Ltd. 
(Family Fun). Family Fun, as assignee, assumed all obligations under the lease of Swento 
& Company, Inc., as assignor. Harvey Swento executed [***6] the assignment on behalf 
of both Swento & Company, Inc., and Family Fun. Under the assignment, all terms of the 
lease remained the same. 
On February 24, 1992, the parties executed a "Third Amendment to Lease," which 
extended the dates for the commencement and completion of tenant's work and provided 
for tenant's electrical service modification. Under the amendment, the new opening date 
for Family Fun was extended to April 7, 1992, and all other terms of the lease remained 
the same. The amendment also provided: 
"Harvey Swento and Cherry L. Swento have executed the Third Amendment to Lease solely as guarantors of the 
Lease and not as parties to the Lease to reaffirm their obligations under that certain Personal Guaranty dated as of July 
8. 1991 in favor of Landlord." 
In 1996, title to the property in which the leased space was located was conveyed from the 
Land Trust to plaintiff CEC, together with all rights, title, and interest of the Land Trust 
under the lease. 
On February 18, 1997, the Swentos assigned and transferred all of their rights, title and 
interest as the limited partners in Family Fun to another company, Jeepers! of Illinois, Inc. 
(Jeepers Illinois). Also, on February 18, [*..7] 1997, Jeepers! Inc. (Jeepers), as parent 
company to Jeepers Illinois, entered into an indemnification agreement. Under the 
indemnification agreement, Jeepers agreed to indemnify the Swentos [**134] for any and 
all losses they may incur as a result of their personal guaranty. 
On December 26, 1997, the Swentos assigned all of their rights, title and interest as the 
sole general partner of Family Fun to Jeepers and Jeepers Illinois, pursuant to a general 
partner interest assignment. On March 25, 1998, Family Fun was dissolved by its new 
owners, and Jeepers and Jeepers Illinois succeeded to the interest of and assumed all 
obligations under the lease. 
On February 17, 2000, CEC, Jeepers, and Jeepers Illinois executed a "Fourth Amendment 
to Lease." In the amendment, the parties acknowledged that Jeepers and Jeepers Illinois, 
as the tenant, had defaulted in its obligations under the lease by failing to pay CEC, as 
[*604] the landlord, rental amounts totaling $ 126,561.73. The parties also stated in the 
amendment that CEC was not willing to consent to the transfer of interests in Family Fun 
to Jeepers Illinois unless the unpaid rent was paid in full and Jeepers, as parent company, 
executed a personal guaranty. [**8] The amendment also included the following provision 
with regard to the Swentos' personal guaranty of the lease:
