of the plea. A motion to withdraw under R.C. 2943.031 does not require such a 
demonstration. State v. Francis, 104 Ohio St.3d 490, 2004-Ohio-6894, 1126-27, 820 
N.E.2d 355; State v. Muhumed, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-1001. 2012-Ohio-6155, 119. 
r P8] The state concedes, and we agree, that the trial court erred when it analyzed 
appellant's ["4] motion under Crim.R. 32.1. Appellant's motion was captioned a "Motion 
to Withdraw Guilty Plea Pursuant to Section 2943.031 of the Ohio Revised Code." The 
motion argued that his counsel and the trial court did not warn him of the deportation 
consequences of his plea and that if he had been so advised he would not have entered 
his guilty plea. Accordingly, the trial court should not have analyzed the motion as one filed 
pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1. We conclude, however, that the trial court's error is harmless, 
because even under the proper analysis, appellant cannot demonstrate that the trial court 
failed to comply with R.C. 2943.031(A). State v. Williamson, 2d Dist. No. 21965, 2008-
Ohio-4727, ¶ 12-16 (concluding that the trial court's application of incorrect standard to 
review motion to withdraw was harmless error because, in part, the motion would not have 
been successful under correct standard); State v. Carswell, 9th Dist. No. 23119, 2006-
Ohio-5210, 1120-22 (no error in applying wrong standard to motion to withdraw where error 
did not prejudice defendant because the motion would not have been successful). 
B. The trial court properly advised appellant pursuant to R.C. 2943.031 
r P9] (HN2] R.C. 2943.031(A) r5] requires a trial court to give the following advisement 
to defendants entering either a guilty plea or a plea of no contest unless the defendant 
indicates that he is a citizen in accordance with R.C. 2943.031(B): 
If you are not a citizen of the United States you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense to which you are 
pleading gtilty ' ' ' may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States. or 
denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States. 
r P10] At his plea hearing, appellant told the trial court (through an interpreter) that he 
was not a citizen of the United States. (Tr. 6.) The trial court then advised appellant that: 
by entering pleas of guilty today. that that cotld — since you are not a United States citizen. that you may suffer the 
consequence of deportation. exclusion from readmission to the United States or denial of naturalization or citizenship 
pursuer* to our laws. So this can have a serious effect upon your status in this county. 
(Tr. 7.) 
r P11] Appellant indicated that he understood the advisement. Additionally, the entry of 
guilty plea form that appellant signed before entering his plea also advised him that his 
conviction r6] "may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to 
the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States." 
rP12] [HN3] If a trial court provides some warning of immigration-related consequences 
at the time of a plea but not a verbatim recital of the warnings set forth in R.C. 2943.031, a 
trial court considering a motion to withdraw filed under the statute must determine whether 
the trial court's warning substantially complied with R.C. 2943.031(A). Francis at 1148. In 
this context, substantial compliance means that a defendant is informed and, under the 
totality of the circumstances, subjectively understands that by entering a guilty plea he may
