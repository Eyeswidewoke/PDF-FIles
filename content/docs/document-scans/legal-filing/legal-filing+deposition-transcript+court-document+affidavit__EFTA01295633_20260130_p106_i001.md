2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
BIC argues that the fraud claims asserted against BIC do not meet the heightened 
pleading standard of Rule 9(b), which provides that "[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party 
must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, 
knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally." Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 9(b).' 
Rule 9(b) is satisfied if the complaint sets forth '(1) precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral 
representations or what omissions were made, and (2) the time and place of each such statement and the person 
responsible for making (or. in the case of omissions, not making) same, and (3) the content of such statements arid the 
manner in which they misled the plaintiff. and (4) what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.' Brooks 
v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida. Inc.. 116 F.3d 1364. 1371 (11th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation omitted). 
Ziemba v. Cascade Intl, Inc., 256 F.3d 1194, 1202 (11th Cir. 2001). However, the 
application of this rule "must not abrogate the concept of notice pleading." Id. (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, "[t]here is no 'one size fits all' checklist 
p271 for satisfying [the Rule 9 pleading] requirement. Claybar v. Huffman, 54 F. Supp. 3d 
1284, 1288 (S.D. Ala. 2014) (citing Tello v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 494 F. 3d 956, 
972-73 (11th Cir. 2007) ('While allegations of date, time or place satisfy the Rule 9(b) 
requirement that the circumstances of the alleged fraud must be pleaded with particularity, 
we have acknowledged that alternative means are also available to satisfy the rule in 
substantiating fraud allegations."); Mechler, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75955, 2008 WL 
4493230, at *3 ("Plaintiffs' fraud/fraudulent suppression claim could be better pled; 
however, the complaint, taken as a whole, sufficiently alerts the defendant to the 
misconduct with which it is charged.")). 
7 BIC also argues that the Plaintiff's fraud claims fail to meet the pleading requirements of Rule 9(f); however. BIC fails to 
clearly articulate this argument or distinguish it from BIC's argument under Rule 9(b). (Doc. 65 at 6-7.) Rule 9(0 provides that 
"[ski allegation of time or place is material when testing the sufficiency of a pleading." Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(f). The oNy case cited 
by BIC with regard to Rule 9(I) is MiCOl Indus_ Inc. v. C2JS Holdngs. Inc.. in which the Northern District of Alabama briefly 
summarized the allegations in the complaint before it and found that it satisfied the requirements of Rules 9(b) and 9(t). Miser 
Indus., Civil Action No. 12-S42654-NE, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEAS 167300, 2012 WL 5931707, at '7 (N.D. Ala. Nov. 26. 2012). The 
court in Mica Indus. did not conduct any discussion of Rule 9(f) or otherwise r28) provide support for BIC's assertion that the 
TAC does not comply with that Rule. In any event, "pleadings that are specific enough to satisfy Rule 9(b) are also specific 
enough to satisfy Rule 9(f)." Orix Real Estate Capital Markets. LLC v. Superior Bank FSB, 127 F. Supp. 2d 961, 986 (N. D. M. 
2000). Thus, because the undersigned finds below that the TAC complies with Rule 9(b), the undersigned also finds that the 
TAC does not rim afoul of Rule 9(1). 
After reviewing Counts 
the undersigned concludes that the Plaintiff has met the Rule 
9 pleading requirements. With respect to the misrepresentation claim, the Plaintiff alleges, 
in paragraph 57 of the TAC, that BIC misrepresented Specialty as being financially sound. 
(Doc. 64, 1157.) Paragraph 57 contains numerous subparagraphs setting forth multiple 
representations with varying degrees of particularity. Although certain subparagraphs do 
not contain clear statements described with particularity, some statements are alleged with 
sufficient detail. For example, the Plaintiff alleges that, on February 6, 2013, Pappaceno 
sent the Plaintiff an instant message stating, with respect to Specialty, that "Business is 
good," and that "[Specialty] should have [the Plaintiffs] invoice paid within 10 business 
days." (Id., ¶ 57(i) (emphasis omitted).)° Additionally, the Plaintiff alleges ['29] that BIC 
misrepresented the status of fuel oil securing the Plaintiffs transactions with Specialty 
when, on April 11, 2013, Pappaceno sent the Plaintiff an instant message proposing that 
the Plaintiff enter into another purchase agreement with Specialty and stating that the
