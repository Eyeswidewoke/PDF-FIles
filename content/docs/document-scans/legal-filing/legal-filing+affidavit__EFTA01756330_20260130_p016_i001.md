It is impossible no= to hide the fact that the birth of the Kurdish state means, in the best o= circumstances, betting on 
the continuation and escalation of internal cri=es in these countries and other crises in the countries bordering 
Kurdistan. Underlying this is the hope that the=r bilateral relations will worsen, and lead to these countries clashing-
wh=ch in turn will open the door for the creation of the Kurdish state. Today=is the day of federations, tomorrow the 
day of confederations, and after that separation, and the declaration =f nationhood. 
Barzani, the most p=werful Kurdish leader (as he became following the recent regional election=), knows that what he is 
waiting for his extremely difficult, but he will =ot back down so as to avoid being accused of shirking this historic 
responsibility before his people. His statement =hat the expected alternative in Syria must take into account the rights 
an= demands of the Kurds—"We have trained young Kurdish Syrians to fight,=and we will fight alongside them if 
necessary"—can be explained with reference to the fact that the fight =hey have been trained for is not Syria's civil war. 
So why all these pre=arations, and when and how will they be used? 
Barzani warned thos= assaulting the Kurds in Syria, but the real message was for Iran and Turk=y as well. So are we 
surprised by the Erbil conference expected to modify =he proposals and positions it launched three months ago, 
discussions with Baghdad, Damascus, Ankara and Tehran on=a new road map for Kurdistan, or the announcement that 
Greater Kurdistan i= the new strategic aim, or by the calls for self-governance following the =ailure of the Iraqi 
experiment. 
Massoud Barzani's=comments had the way prepared for them by Prime Minister Nechervan Barzani=92s noting that 
communications with Baghdad were almost entirely cut off, =nd that the person threatening the unity of Iraq is in fact 
Al-Maliki himself and that Iraqi Kurds have a historic =hance to declare independence. But there are important 
objections, not lea=t from Ankara which has always held the creation of an independent Kurdish=state in northern Iraq 
as a red line. 
Barzani has reminde= everyone that the region is experiencing events that make it impossible t= ignore Kurdish 
ambitions. We know that geopolitics is available to the Ku=ds and that what they now need is a geo-strategy. But Erbil 
also knows that circumstances in Iraq are differen= from 2003, and that the fronts are overlapping, intertwining and 
becoming=increasingly complex. 
The Kurds have made=strides in evolving an identity and there is now regional and internationa= recognition of it, with 
some ready to redraw the map, but they also know =ow difficult it will be to get these four countries to agree to redress 
their constitutional and political make=p. 
Barzani knows more =o than anyone else the difficulties of playing the game of duplicity and s=eking to take advantage 
of the contradictions and conflicts of interest be=ween the countries of the region. And it is perhaps for this reason he 
has decided to make his move now, but man= of his recent speeches need to be clarified and examined, for they are fa= 
too important to just be directed at Syria and those trying to target and=strike at the stability of security in Iraqi 
Kurdistan.
