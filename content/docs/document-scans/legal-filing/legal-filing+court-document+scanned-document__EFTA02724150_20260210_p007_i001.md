would cost a willing buyer, combine to minimize any effect to the contrary that their "psychic" attachment to the an might otherwise 
have on the discounts that apply here. To repeat. Mrs. Sasser testified that it hypothetically. she and her siblings were to purchase 
such interests. it would only be after first determining from experts that any price was fair and reasonable. And the experts consulted 
would likely be those persons whom the Tax Court accepted at trial: experts whose ultimate values were based on their substantial 
discounts below FMV. 
Furthermore. like the absence of an established market. the subjective characteristics of the Decedent's descendants as the owners of the 
remaining fractional interests would likely cut the other way: A potential willing buyer would undoubtedly insist that his potential 
willing seller further discount the sales price to account for the virtual impossibility of making an immediate "flip" of the art. Such a 
fully informed willing buyer would be well aware that, by virtue of becoming a co-owner with the sophisticated. determined. and 
financially independent Elkins heirs, he could not possibly make such a quick resale absent a deep discount, that is. And, the 
situation is only exacerbated by the effect of the various restrictions on partition, alienation, and possession that survived the death of 
the Decedent. 
III. CONCLUSION 
We conclude our review by examining the entire record to see if we can determine the correct quantums of the fractional-ownership 
discounts and thereby avoid remand. When we do so. we conclude that the discounts determined by the Estates experts are not just 
the only ones proved in court: they arc eminently correct. We arc never comfortable in disagreeing with. much less reversing. a jurist 
of the experience, reputation, and respect enjoyed by the Tax Court judge whose work product we are called on to review today. Yet. 
our review of the court's extensive explication of this case and its ultimate conclusion that the proper discount is 10 percent. leaves us 
with the "definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made."' 
19 Green v. Comm'. 507 F.3d 857, 866 (5th Cir. 2007). 
At bottom, we find nothing in this record or in the Tax Court's opinion that would justify any conclusion other than that the Estate is 
entitled to a final determination of the estate tax owed that produces a tax refund calculated on the basis of the fractional-ownership 
discounts and net taxable INIVs set forth on Exhibit B to the court's opinion the record on appeal is sufficient for us to render a final 
judgment and dispose of the sole issue in this case without prolonging it by remand at the cost of more time and money to the parties. 
Accordingly, we ( I) affirm the Tax Court's rejection of the Commissioner's insistence that no fractional-ownership discount may be 
applied in determining the taxable values of Decedent's undivided interests in the subject art work: (2) aflimi the Tax Court's holding 
that the Estate is entitled to apply a fractional-ownership discount to the Decedent's ratable share of the stipulated FMV of each of the 
64 works of an; (3) reverse the Tax Court's holding that the appropriate fractional-ownership discount is a nominal 10 percent, 
uniformly applied to each work of an. regardless of distinguishing features: (4) hold that the correct quantums of the 
fractionalownership discounts applicable to the Ikcedent's pro rata share of the stipulated FM Vs of the various works of art are those 
determined by the Estates experts and itemized on Exhibit B to the Tax Court's opinion; and (5) render judgment in favor of the 
Estate for a refund of taxes overpaid in the amount of 514.359.508.21. plus statutory interest in a sum to be agreed on by the parties. 
based on the timing of the payment of that refund to the Estate, all as jointly stipulated to us by the panics. 
AFFIRMED in pan: REVERSED in part: and RENDERED.
