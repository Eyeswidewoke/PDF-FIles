U.S. federal income tax purposes. except to the extent that the Notes are considered debt-financed property (as 
defined in the Code) of that entity. A tax-exempt holder that owns more than 50% of the Outstanding Income Notes

exempt from any U.S. federal income or withholding taxes with respect to gain derived from the sale. exchange. or 
redemption of, or any distributions received in respect of, the Notes, unless such gain or distributions are effectively 
connected with a U.S. trade or business of such holder, or. in the case of gain, such holder is a nonresident alien 
individual who holds the Notes as a capital asset and who is present in the United States more than 182 days in the 
taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are met. A non-U.S. holder will not be considered to be engaged 
in a U.S. trade or business solely by reason of holding Notes. "Non-effectively connected" gain or distributions 
received by a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. information reporting requirements or U.S. backup 
withholding, although such holders may be required to furnish a certificate to the paying agent of the Issuer attesting 
to their status as non-U.S. holders. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
Information reporting to the IRS generally will be required with respect to payments on the Notes and 
proceeds of the sale of the Notes to holders other than corporations and other exempt recipients. A "backup" 
withholding tax will apply to those payments if such holder fails to provide certain identifying information (such as 
such holder's taxpayer identification number) to the Trustee or other paying agent. Non-U.S. holders may be 
required to comply with applicable certification procedures to establish that they are not U.S. holders in older to 
avoid the application of such information reporting requirements and backup withholding. 
Transfer Reporting Requirements 
Treasury regulations require reporting for certain transfers of property (including cash) to a foreign 
corporation by U.S. persons. In general, U.S. holders who acquire Income Notes arc required to file a Form 926 with 
the IRS and to supply certain information to the IRS. If a U.S. holder fails to comply with the reporting 
requirements, the U.S. holder may be subject to a penalty equal to 10% of the gross amount paid for the applicable 
Notes. subject to a maximum penalty of U.S. 5100.000 (except in cases involving intentional disregard). Purchasers 
of Income Notes are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding these reporting requirements. 
In addition, the Code and related Treasury regulations require that any U.S. holder that directly or indirectly 
owns a significant portion of the voting power or value of the Issuer's equity (generally 10 percent, but in some 
cases more than 50 percent) must comply with certain reporting requirements. While it is unclear how the voting 
power of the applicable Notes would be measured for this purpose, a U.S. Holder that owns less than 10 percent (or 
50 percent or less, as applicable) of the applicable Notes should not be required to file this return. In general, such 
holders of the applicable percentage of the voting power or value of the Issuer's equity are required to file a Form 
5471 with the IRS and to supply certain information with the IRS, including with respect to the activities and assets 
of the Issuer and other holders of the Income Notes. 
If a U.S. holder fails to comply with the reporting 
requirements, the U.S. holder may be subject to a penalty, depending on the circumstances, equal to U.S. $10,000 
for each failure to comply, subject to a maximum of U.S. $60,000. Purchasers of Income Notes arc urged to consult 
their tax advisors regarding these reporting requirements.
