something like that, and someone else would say, "Yeah, it would be cool to know that." It seemed that there should be 
this giant, all-knowing =brain, which could answer that kind of question. One of the lessons you =learn in becoming an 
adult is that it doesn't always pay to be curious. =Some people learn to avoid curiosity altogether. Gates appears to have 
=completely failed to absorb this lesson. My impression is that he still =has the fantasy of the giant, all-knowing brain, 
and that this is what =the information highway means to him. It's a place where curiosity is rewarded. 
Not long ago, Paul Saffo, of the Institute for the Future, said to me, "Bill Gates is an introvert. He is not the kind of 
=person you want building the social network of the future." Ann Winblad, Gates' former girlfriend, told me, "People 
who know Bill know that you =have to bring him into a group--say, 'Hey, Bill, tell us the story of such-and-such'--because 
he doesn't have the social skills to do it on his own. But that doesn't mean he isn't social. Bill is an open, emotional guy--
very. He's actually more open with his feelings than most men I know. He is not afraid to express fear, or sadness, but 
hardly anyone sees that. You can't show that when you're in Bill's position, when everyone is watching your tiniest 
gesture. It's not good leadership to show weakness." An executive with a leading competitor of Microsoft's says of 
Gates, "Hey--I think the guy is truly dangerous. Bill is the most surprisingly conscience-free individual I've ever met, =and 
that amount of power in the hands of a guy without a conscience is =dangerous. Big Brother did not happen in 1984, but 
it could happen in 2004. Ask yourself, 'If there was to be a technology-oriented dictator =by the year 2004, who would 
he be? Bill Gates?'" 
Gates argues that Microsoft has to behave aggressively because of a principle called Moore's Law, which is named =after 
Gordon Moore, one of the founders of the Intel Corporation. Moore's Law is the reason the computer industry is 
fundamentally different from any other industry in history. It states that microprocessors get twice as powerful, or twice 
as cheap, every eighteen months. This means that in twenty years what now takes a year of computing will take fifteen 
minutes. We have no idea what we are going =to do with this power, but it will exist whether we want it to or not. =/p> 
No natural calamity or political upheaval short of world-wide anarchy is powerful enough to stop it. Nathan Mhyrvold, of 
Microsoft, said to me, "Nature has already signed off on this stuff." Moore's Law is the primary reason that all the 
companies that dominated =the computer industry in the nineteen-seventies are now struggling or gone, and the reason 
that Microsoft, for all its power, could disappear =in a decade. 
Scott McNealy, the head of Sun Microsystems, which is a leading manufacturer of computer workstations, told me, "I 
like Bill. Bill is a smart guy. But I think the problem is that Microsoft has caught the bunny. You know, when you go to the 
dog track they have that mechanical bunny that makes the dogs run? Well, sometimes a dog is so =fast he catches the 
bunny and then the other dogs don't run anymore. That's the situation in the software business today: Bill has caught 
the bunny. I admire Bill for catching the bunny, but now we can't have a race. He ought to be loosed from the bunny, to 
give the other dogs a chance." 
The argument that Microsoft is shaping up to be the Standard Oil of the Information Age and that the government ought 
to loose Bill from the bunny before this happens is now being heard within =the Department of Justice. As the head of 
the Department's Antitrust Division, Anne Bingaman is an anti-monopolist, the sort of person who was common around 
the Justice Department in the nineteen-thirties and forties, and was thoroughly weeded out in the eighties, a period 
during =which the laws on what constitutes a monopoly were relaxed, making it harder for people like Bingaman to 
operate. Now Bingaman is expected to =regain some of the ground lost by the anti-monopolists, and she seems to be 
using Microsoft as her vehicle. Justice Department lawyers are currently studying the file that Bingaman requested from 
the Federal Trade Commission, and are said to be readying a case against Microsoft, =though whether Bingaman will 
bring narrow antitrust charges, which would require the company to pay a fine it could easily afford, or will bring a 
broad antitrust case, or will even attempt to break Microsoft up, has not been decided. 
There is substantial political pressure not to prosecute Microsoft. Microsoft is the principal reason that the United 
=States is by far the world leader in software production, an industry that has an unimaginable potential for growth. 
Also, the government's huge antitrust case against I.B.M., which was filed in 1969 and ended with the government's 
giving up on it in 1982, distracted and weakened =that organization, and helped companies like Microsoft to get the 
better of it. Some people argue that the computer industry actually wants and =needs a monopolistic presence like
