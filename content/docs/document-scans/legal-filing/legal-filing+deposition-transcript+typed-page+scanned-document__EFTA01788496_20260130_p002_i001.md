Despite that setback, the way ahead for satellite technology is clear. "You can now, with a single chip, create most of the 
capabilities that you would have found in Sputnik, but, of course, orders of magnitude faster," says Mason Peck, a 
former chief technologist at NASA and now a professor at Cornell University. 
The most ambitious project to date is a flock of 28 nanosats, each one three CubeSats in size (ie, 30cm long). These were 
carried to the 155 in January and released in batches (pictured at the beginning of this article) through a sort of satellite 
shooter developed by NanoRacks, an American company. These nanosats came from Planet Labs, a firm based in San 
Francisco. The satellites now take pictures as they scan the Earth more frequently than traditional ones and at a fraction 
of the cost, albeit at a lower resolution. 
Planet Labs, funded modestly with $65m of private investment, says its nanosats provide much of the performance of a 
conventional satellite for a fraction of the cost. That reflects a lot of antiquated technology in the space business, much 
of which can be bettered by the latest off-the-shelf equipment, says Will Marshall, Planet Labs' boss. There are other 
cost-saving measures. Satellites are usually built in elaborate clean rooms, but Planet Labs assembles its nanosats in 
"clean-enough" rooms in its downtown offices. The company expects to put another 100 nanosats into orbit in the next 
12 to 18 months. 
A few miles away, in another modest San Francisco office, Nanosatisfi is working on its ArduSats. These are open-source 
platforms and two have already gone up. They will contain an array of sensors and can carry out various missions, such 
as locating things. More than 250,000 ships, for instance, now broadcast an automatic identification signal than carries 
about 50 nautical miles. A fleet of small satellites in low orbit could pick up these signals and provide frequent updates 
about the ships' positions without the vessels having to use costly dedicated satellite uplinks. Such a system might have 
been able to track Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which went missing in March. 
Farther south in Mountain View, Skybox captures high-resolution imaging data from its first satellite in orbit as it 
prepares another 23 to launch in the coming years. Some things, though, can be shrunk only so far and larger satellites 
are needed for a telescope to obtain the higher resolutions required for the firm's analysis. While Skybox's minisatellites 
weigh around 100kg, a fairly common size for small satellites, the firm proved its concept to investors using CubeSats. 
"Being able to put something in space at very low cost allows you to demonstrate the technology to get more money," 
says Dan Berkenstock, one of the company's founders. 
The CubeSat specification came out of the academic world in the late 1990s. Bob Twiggs, then at Stanford University and 
now at Morehead State University, was frustrated by long delays on a large-satellite programme and set about thinking 
how much satellite capability might be crammed into a much smaller craft that could be launched cheaply. Space 
launches usually comprise one or more primary payloads and require ballast to balance the rocket. CubeSats, reasoned 
Mr Twiggs, could take the place of some of this ballast, so long as they did not jeopardise the main mission. The 
optimum size Mr Twiggs came up with was based on a box used to display Beanie Babies. Later, with Jordi Puig-Suari of 
California Polytechnic State University, it was turned into a full specification. Mr Twiggs also developed the 5cm 
PocketQube, which has a maximum weight of 180 grammes. 
Small satellites benefit from the constant improvements in price and performance being achieved by the consumer-
electronics industry, particularly in smartphones. A typical phone is now likely to contain an accelerometer to measure 
how fast it is moving, a magnetometer to detect magnetic fields and provide a compass reading, a GPS receiver to pick 
up satellite data, multiple radios, a gyroscope to measure its position, a barometer to detect pressure, two cameras and 
much more. 
Last year the world's first "phonesat" went into orbit. It was a Google Nexus One smartphone incorporated into a three-
unit CubeSat called STRaND-1. This was built by Surrey Satellite Technology, a British firm that specialises in small 
satellites and which is part of the European Airbus group. The idea was to test the components of the smartphone in a 
space environment. The phone was loaded with a number of experimental apps for such things as taking photographs 
and recording magnetic fields during orbit.
