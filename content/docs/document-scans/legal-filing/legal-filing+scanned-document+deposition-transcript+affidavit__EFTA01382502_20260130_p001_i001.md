SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
group of truck drivers from the Tracy distribution center filed a similar action in the same court, entitled Bluford, et al. v. Safeway Inc., 
alleging essentially the same claims against the Company. Both cases were subsequently certified as class actions. After lengthy 
litigation in the trial and appellate courts. On February 20, 2015. the parties signed a preliminary agreement of settlement that calls for 
the Company to pay approximately 531 million in total. This amount consists of a settlement fund of 530.2 million, out of which will be 
paid relief to the class, and attorneys' fees and costs as awarded by the court. In addition to this settlement fund, the Company will pay 
interest of $10,000 if the distribution to the class is made in August 2015, with additional monthly amounts of interest if later. The 
Company will also pay third party settlement administrator costs, and its employer share of FICA/Medicare taxes. The Company 
anticipates that a motion for preliminary court approval of the settlement will be heard in the Spring of 2015. If such preliminary approval 
is granted, class members will be notified and given the opportunity to file objections to the settlement. Following that, a motion for final 
approval of the settlement would be filed in mid-2015. 
As previously reported, in the second quarter of 2014, the Company received two subpoenas from the Drug Enforcement 
Administration ("DEA") concerning the Company's record keeping, reporting and related practices associated with the loss or theft of 
controlled substances. The Company continues to cooperate with the DEA on this matter. 
As previously reported, in February 2012, Safeway was served with a subpoena issued by a group of California District Attorneys 
seeking documents and information related to the handling, disposal and reverse logistics of potential hazardous waste within the State. 
The subject matter of the subpoena relates to the handling and transportation of unsaleable household items, including, but not limited 
to. cleaners, aerosols, hair shampoos, dye, lotions, light bulbs, batteries, over-the-counter and similar items. On January 2, 2015, the 
Company settled an action with the State of California, including various California counties, on this matter by agreeing to pay civil 
penalties and costs and to fund specified Supplemental Environmental Projects in the amount of $9.9 million. As part of the settlement, 
the Company also agreed to certain ongoing compliance activities with respect to both potential hazardous waste and private health 
information. 
The Company is subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including 
lawsuits involving trade practices, lawsuits alleging violations of state and/or federal wage and hour laws (including alleged violations of 
meal and rest period laws and alleged misclassification issues), real estate disputes and other matters. Some of these suits purport or 
may be determined to be class actions and/or seek substantial damages. 
It is management's opinion that although the amount of liability with respect to all of the above matters cannot be ascertained at 
this time, any resulting liability, including any punitive damages, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or 
financial condition. 
Commitments The Company has commitments under contracts for the purchase of property and equipment and for the 
construction of buildings, the purchase of energy and other purchase obligations. Portions of such contracts not completed at year end 
are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. These purchase commitments were $257.8 million at year-end 2014.
