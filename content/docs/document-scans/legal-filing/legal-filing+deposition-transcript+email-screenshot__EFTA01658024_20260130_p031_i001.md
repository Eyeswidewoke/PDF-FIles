coronavirus rescue package. ... Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steve 
Mnuchin say talks with congressional Democrats have been productive, but they are still far 
apart on a deal." Meadows, on CBS' Face The NationVi (8/2, 2.67M), said, "We still have a long 
ways to go. I can tell you that we spent the last four days trying to get to some kind of 
consensus, at least to start negotiating. ... I'm not optimistic there will be a solution in the very 
near term, and that's why I think the effort that Sen. Martha McSally led on the Senate floor to 
extend the enhanced unemployment was the right move, and yet [Senate Minority Leader] 
Schumer and his Democratic colleagues blocked that." Mnuchin, on ABC's This WeekVi (8/2, 
2.52M), said, "The President is very concerned about the expiration of the unemployment 
insurance. We proposed a one-week extension at $600 so that while we negotiate a longer-
term solution at least all those people don't lose their money, and I'm surprised that the 
Democrats won't agree to that, they're insisting on having this as part of a larger deal." 
Two top House leaders spoke for the Democrats on Sunday. House Speaker Pelosi said on 
ABC's This WeekVi (8/2, 2.52M), "The $600 is essential for America's working families and, 
again, to condescend, to disrespect their motivation, is so amazing, how insistent the 
Republicans are about working families and their $600, and how cavalier they are about other 
money that's going out." Pelosi said on MSNBC's AM JoyVi (8/2, 866K), "We want to put money 
into the pockets of American people. ... They put $200 forth the end of last week - $200, very 
condescending to working families." House Majority Whip Clyburn said on CNN's State Of The 
UnionVi (8/2, 951K), "I don't know how close we are to a deal. ... The big problem to me was 
that people trying to put food on the table, people who are unemployed, people who are having 
their unemployment compensation supplemented by the $600 and they want to cut it down to 
$200 and at the same time give 100% tax deductions to business lunches. What kind of priority 
is that?" On CBS' Face The NationVi (8/2, 2.67M), Clybum said, "Let's lay out some security in 
their lives, some stability in their lives." 
Reuters (8/2, Chiacu, Ahmann) reports Meadows said "he was not optimistic on reaching 
agreement soon," arguing that "Democrats were standing in the way of a separate agreement 
to extend some federal unemployment benefits in the short-term while negotiations continue on 
an overall relief package." USA Today (8/2, Behrmann, 10.31M) reports Pelosi "remained 
steadfast in her desire to pass a larger bill and not take the gradual approach suggested by 
Republicans and the White House, such as a short-term extension of the unemployment 
benefit." 
Politico (8/2, McCaskill, 4.29M) says the negotiators "couldn't even agree on what they 
agree on Sunday, indicating that Democrats and Republicans are still a ways away from 
clinching a deal." The Washington Post (8/2, Werner, Rosenberg, 14.2M) reports Meadows, 
Mnuchin, and Pelosi "made clear in separate interviews Sunday that they remain far apart on a 
coronavirus relief deal that would restore expired unemployment benefits for millions of 
Americans," while the New York Times (8/2, Cochrane, 18.61M) says GOP leaders have 
conceded that "at least 20 Senate Republicans are unlikely to support any additional 
spending...in part because of concerns over the level of spending and its effect on the national 
debt." The Wall Street Journal (8/2, Zumbrun, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports an 
already-passed House bill would extend the $600 federal jobless benefit through January. 
Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), a vice-presidential prospect, said on Fox News SundayVi 
(8/2, 1.01M), "The one-week extension is not enough. Americans across this country are 
hurting right now. There are families who don't know if they're going to be able to pay their 
rent. Today is the beginning of the month in August, and many families just missed the first 
rent payment or the first mortgage payment. Many families are not going to know if within two 
weeks their kids are going to go hungry." 
Bloomberg (8/2, Bull, 4.73M) reports Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel 
Kashkari told CBS on Sunday "that Americans are saving more because they aren't going out as 
much during the pandemic, and as a result there would be less need to borrow from abroad to
