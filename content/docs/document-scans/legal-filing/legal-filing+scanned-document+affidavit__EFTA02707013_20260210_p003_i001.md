White Paper 
GENI-Lab 
January 03, 2013 
1. Machine empathy—the machines should understand how people feel, what people's 
objectives are, and how to plan optimally for the greatest possible good, a.k.a. creativity, 
preservation, wealth, stability, and happiness, for the greatest number of people, over the 
longest possible period of time. 
2. Machine values—machines should value and understand life, knowledge, and human 
civilization. 
3. Priority development of those interfaces and applications that enable machines to bond with 
people, and develop capabilities of empathy—such as character robots and agents. Such 
intelligent character machines require a unique combination of flexible cognitive architecture, 
powers of empathy, and and intuitive naturalistic interface for interacting with people. 
Cognitive character machines have numerous early applications as well, from customer 
service, to therapy, to entertainment, and science applications. 
People 
Dr. David Hanson brings extensive practical experience leading research and building mass-manufactured 
commercial robots like the Robokind, and customized adult human scale robots like Hubo-Einstein 
(Hanson et al, 2006). 
Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the international movement in the Al field toward "Artificial General Intelligence", 
and serves as the chief architect of the OpenCog cognitive architecture, which has been extensively 
used to control virtual agents in online worlds, and to control Nao humanoid robots (Goerztel, 2007). 
Dr. Mark Tilden  is a robotics physicist who produces complex, intelligent behavior in robots using 
analog logic circuits, best known for his invention of BEAM robotics and the WowWee Robosapien 
humanoid robot. He has developed human-scale biped robots, manufactured at low cost in China. 
Infrastructure 
GENI will develop a software infrastructure for intelligent systems, with realistic humanlike robotic 
embodiments. The humanoid robots will be provided by David Hanson and Mark Tilden. To start 
Hanson Robotics will provide the Android Portrait of Philip K. Dick as a platform to begin, as well as 
Hanson Robotics open software for cognitive humanoids. Ben Goertzel will provide Open Cog support, 
and guidance towards the improved infrastructure for Genius Machines. 
Much infrastructure developed by GENI will be made open source, to facilitate rapid and wide-
spread development. However, developers working with the GENI codebase can make their own code 
either proprietary or open-source—the choice is up to them. Proprietary code can interface with open 
source code in such a way that both licenses are preserved, and the rights of all developers are 
protected. Commercial applications may be freely developed and deployed with the open-source 
code-base. This mixed-IP approach allows companies and institutions with differing IP policies to 
collaborate and mutually benefit, and the whole system grows smarter as a result. 
While GENI will define and manage top-down objectives for intelligent systems, GENI is not just top-
down, but is bottom-up as well, enabling spontaneous participation, collaborations, and construction 
and testing of novel systems designs. 
For the top-down activities, the GENI organization will: 
1. charter objectives for researchers, including proposed cognitive systems architectures 
2. hold competitions and judge the results 
3. manage multi-institutional funding acquisition and allocation 
For the bottom-up activities, GENI will provide: 
1. Social network with tools for collaboration
