(b) after purchase of all of the foregoing Shares, all other Shares validly tendered at or below the Purchase Price and not 
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date on a pro rata basis, if necessary (with appropriate adjustments to avoid 
purchases of fractional Shares). 
The Company expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) extend the period of time during which the Offer is 
open by giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositary (as defined below) or (i=) amend the Offer in 
any respect by making a public announcement of such amendment. 
Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date. Thereafter, 
such tenders are irrevocable, exc=pt that they may be withdrawn after July 2, 1999 unless theretofore accepted f=r 
payment as provided in the Offer to Purchase. To be effective, a written, telegraphic or facsimile transmission notice of 
withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth in the Offer t= Purchase and must 
specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares to=be withdrawn and the number of Shares to be withdrawn 
and the name of the registered holder of the Shares, if different from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If 
the Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered to =he Depositary, a signed notice of withdrawal (with signatures 
guaranteed by an "Eligible Institution" (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), exc=pt in the case of Shares tendered by an 
Eligible Institution) must be submitted prior=to the release of such Shares. In addition, such notice must specify, in the 
c=se of Shares tendered by delivery of certificates, the name of the registered holder (if different from that of the 
tendering stockholder) and the serial numbers shown on the particular certificates evidencing the Shares to be 
withdrawn or, in the case of Shares tendered by book-entry transfer, the na=e and number of the account at the Book-
Entry Transfer Facility (as defined i= the Offer to Purchase) to be credited with the withdrawn Shares. Withdrawal= may 
not be rescinded and Shares withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. 
However, withdrawn Shares may b= retendered by again following one of the procedures described in Section 3 4 the 
Offer to Purchase at any time prior to the Expiration Date. 
For purposes of the Offer, the Company will be deemed to have accepted for payment, subject to the proration and 
"odd lot" provisions of the=Offer, Shares that are validly tendered and not withdrawn as, if and when it gives oral or 
written notice to First Chicago Trust Company of New York (the "Depositary") of its acceptance for payment of such 
Shares. 
While the Board of Directors of the Company believes that the Shares represent an attractive investment for its 
continuing stockholders, the purpose of the Offer is to allow those stockholders wishing to receive cash for a portion of 
their Shares an opportunity to do so at a price in excess =f recent trading prices for the Shares. 
Neither the Company nor its Board of Directors makes any recommendation to any stockholder whether to tender any 
or all Shares. Leslie H. Wexner, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, his immedia=e family 
members and affiliated entities have agreed not to tender any Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Company has been 
advised that its other director= and executive officers have not determined whether to tender their Shares pursuant to 
the Offer. Stockholders must make their own decision whether to tender Shares and, if so, how many Shares to tender. 
The information required to be disclosed by Rule 13e-4(d)(1) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended= is contained in the Offer to Purchase and is incorporated herein by referen=e. 
The Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal will be mailed to record holders of Shares of the Company 
and will be furnished to brokers= dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names,=or the 
names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder list or, if applicab=e, who are listed as participants in a clearing 
agency's security position listing for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of Shares. 
The Offer to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal contain important information which should be read before any decision 
is made with respect t= the Offer.
