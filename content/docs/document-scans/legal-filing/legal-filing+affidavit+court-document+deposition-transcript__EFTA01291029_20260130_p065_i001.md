reduced by the amount of shares on loan. The Proxy Voting Instruction Form sent to you may reflect a smaller number of shares entitled to vote than the number of shares in your margin account.

rate may differ from rates in effect on the date you executed a transaction, incurred a charge, or received a credit. Transactions converted by agents (such as depositories) will be billed at the rates such agents 
use.
