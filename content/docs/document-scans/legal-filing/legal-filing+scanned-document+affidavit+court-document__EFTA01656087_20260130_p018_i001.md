General Events 
• Brooking Institution: Hatch-Waxman at 40  — Thursday, September 19, 2024. Location: Brooking Institution, 
9:30 AM. At the heart of U.S. drug price reduction policy is a law that is about to turn 40 years old: the 
Hatch-Waxman Act (HWA). The HWA, signed in September 1984, attempts to balance lower prices through 
generic competition with innovation incentives to brands. The law does so by lowering barriers to entry for 
generics and by granting various new exclusivities to the brands. The exclusivities give branded 
manufacturers 5-year data exclusivity for new chemical entities (NCEs) and 3-year exclusivity for NCE 
extensions or modifications that are supported by clinical data. 
• Brooking Institution: Great  power competition and overseas bases — Thursday, September 19, 2024. 
Location: Brooking Institution, 3:00 PM. What challenges and risks do Chinese and Russian bases pose to the 
United States' military strategy? How do the great powers' military postures interact and with what 
consequences for regional and global security? In their latest edited volume, "Great Power Competition and 
Overseas Bases: Chinese, Russian, and American Force Posture in the Twenty-First Century," Andrew Yeo and 
Isaac Kardon examine the emerging dynamics of geostrategic competition for overseas military bases and 
base access. On September 19, the Center for Asia Policy Studies and the Strobe Talbott Center for Security, 
Strategy, and Technology at Brookings will host Yeo, Kardon, and two contributors to their edited volume to 
discuss key findings and evaluate the implications of overseas bases in great power competition. Brookings 
Foreign Policy Director of Research Michael E. O'Hanlon will deliver welcoming remarks.
