dozen neighborhood=and city level committees representing the urban poor. A Program Manageme=t Unit (PMU) 
would be set up within the Municipality to help guide key pr=gram activities and to ensure responsiveness and long-
term viability. Oth=r partners, including the Institut Africain de Gestion Urbaine, wi=l provide additional support. 
A. 
Program Desc=iption, Objectives and Results 
The Dakar Urban Municipal Finance Pro=ram would be implemented over a period of five years and would be 
expecte= to cost approximately five million US Dollars. The Program would include=four main phases: 
• 
&nbs=; Involving the Poor in the Program.=/B> This phase of the program would ensure that the voice of 
the poor is=heard by the city from the day the program begins and beyond the life of=the program. It would also reduce 
the risk of municipal bonds proceeds go=ng to projects that are not relevant to the poor. Involving the poor in=the 
program could be done by: a) holding meetings with civil society at=the city hall, and in neighborhoods to announce and 
explain the program,=b) involving the poor in quarterly decisions on how expected resources wo=ld be used, c) creating 
a formal mechanism (for example through an SDI af=iliate), to enable the poor to monitor the use of funds and d) 
implementi=g small pro-poor pilot projects. 
• 
&nbs=; Helping Dakar Issue Municipal Bond=. This phase of the Program would focus on helping the 
Municipality=continue to get its "house in order" from a financial per=pective, and would result in the issuance of 
municipal bonds. Over a peri=d of up to two years, we would work with municipal authorities to ensure=that Dakar can 
fulfill all fiscal, financial and regulatory conditions re=uired to issue long-term debt in the ECOWAS region's capital 
mark=ts. This is notably expected to include: (a) helping the city clean up an= better document its tax base in order to 
maximize future fiscal revenues= (b) obtaining a favorable credit rating, by building on the city.=99s recent work with 
international partners and financers (notably the Fr=nch Agency for International Development or Agence Francaise de 
Developpement); (c) working with=the city and its national government counterparts to ensure that the gove=nment 
will have what it needs to provide its non-objection at the require= time; and (d) preparing all appropriate 
documentation necessary to go to=market, including an explanation of program objectives, repayment cash fl=ws, and 
guarantee or credit enhancement mechanisms. 
• 
&nbs=; Help Obtain Investments for Future=Financing. This phase=of the program consists in raising long-
term financing for pro-poor inves=ments (sanitation, etc.) that cannot be financed through the Municipality=E2,40s 
recurrent budget. Through this grant, we expect the city to rai=e approximately $35 million by 2015 in city-backed debt 
financing. The ty=es of programs that could be piloted in the first few years of the projec= to prepare them for greater 
levels of financing when the bond is success=ully issued include (1) upgrading of the DKL neighborhood(7J 
<http://mail.aol.com/33=90-111/aol-lien-usisuite.aspx#_ftn7> (including=investments in water and sanitation 
infrastructure); (2) improving food=security in Dakar and Pikine, by scaling up urban agriculture initiatives=and 
capitalizing a municipal fund in support of urban micro-gardens; (3)=investing in revamping outdated city-wide solid 
waste in Grand Yoff and=Parcelles Assainies (primary collection) management infrastructure; and=(4) other capital 
investments in informal or poor neighborhoods (such as=street paving or potable water provision) that would increase 
access to=basic services and help create jobs. &n=sp; 
• 
&nbs=; Scale up Investments Once Financin= Obtained. This phase=would begin only after financing has 
been obtained, in the third or fourt= year. Our partners would now ensure that municipal investments are pro-p=or and 
aligned with stated objectives. 
B. 
Monitoring=and Evaluation (M&E) Indicators 
The basic indicators that project par=ners would track, with guidance from DIG, could include some of the 
follo=ing: 
= Diagnosti= of city's debt capacity concluded; 
• 
&nbs=; Amount=of financing raised through municipal bonds on capital markets or private=debt placement; 
• 
&nbs=; Increase=in revenues for the urban poor; 
• 
&nbs=; Number=of people with improved neighborhoods; 
&nbs=; Increase=in number of poor urban families with access to water; 
&nbs=; Increase=in number of poor urban families with access to sanitation services; 
• 
= Increase=in number of streets serviced (primary waste collection);</=iv>
