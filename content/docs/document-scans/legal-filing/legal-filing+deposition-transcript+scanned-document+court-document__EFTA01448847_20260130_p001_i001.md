considered a V.S. person if you at 
• An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, 
• A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or 
organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, 
• An estate (other than a foreign estate), or 
• A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7). 
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or 
business in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding 
tax on any foreign partners' share of income from such business. 
Further, in sedan cases where a Form W.9 has not been received, a 
partnership is required to presume that a partner is a foreign person, 
and pay the withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a 
partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United 
States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. 
status and avoid withholding on your share of partnership Income.
