Azeri, and Kurdish minorities could be exploited by the United States and Israel. In addition, Dagan suggested supporting 
student pro-democracy activists, if only to cause unrest inside Iran. 
The official summary said Dagan felt sure that the U.S. and Israel could "change the ruling regime in Iran and its 
attitude toward backing terror regimes," and that "we could also get them to delay their nuclear project." According to 
the cable, Dagan said, "The economy is hurting, and this is provoking a real crisis among Iran's leaders." The minority 
groups that the Mossad and CIA could support or exploit are "raising their heads and are tempted to resort to violence." 
Economic woes and high unemployment have only become worse in Iran, as U.S.-led sanctions have begun to 
bite. From the Mossad's perspective, unhappy and aimless young males in Iran represent an opportunity to recruit 
sources of information, agents who can be trained, and even mercenary or rebel armies. 
Yet for such a sensitive, dangerous, and daring mission as a series of assassinations in Iran's capital, the Mossad 
would not depend on hired-gun mercenaries. They would be considered far less trustworthy, and there was hardly any 
chance that the Mossad would reveal to non-Israelis the unique methods developed by the Kidon unit. 
Mossad chief Dagan was pleased by the missions in Iran and the "cleanliness" of their execution: no clues, no 
fingerprints, not even motorcycles left behind. 
Naturally, no one in Jerusalem was talking about any operational details of how Israelis entered and left Iran—or 
where they stayed while inside the Islamic Republic. Since the beginning of the State of Israel in 1948, its covert 
operatives have never found it difficult to masquerade as locals in every corner of the vast Middle East. 
There were many possibilities. Obviously, Israeli operatives traveled using the passports of other countries, 
including bogus documents produced by skilled Mossad forgers and genuine passports where the photographs might be 
altered slightly. The spy agency's use of phony, borrowed, and probably stolen non-Israeli passports has been 
inadvertently revealed several times, over many years. After a Mossad team led by Kidon assassins killed a Palestinian 
Islamist militant in a hotel in Dubai in January of 2010, the local police chief gleefully displayed video footage from 
security cameras that showed surveillance teams doing their shadowy work —frequently changing wigs and eyeglasses—
and even the men wearing tennis whites, shorts, and others with baseball caps who were almost certainly the killers. 
The police chief, General Dahi Khalfan, showed the visages of 27 men and women, displaying photos from their 
apparently bogus passports. Although the British, Australian, and Irish governments expressed anger at the Mossad for 
abusing their passports, diplomatic damage to Israel was minimal. In fact, Meir Dagan was fully satisfied with the 
outcome of the Dubai operation: The target—Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, in charge of arms acquisition for Hamas—was 
dead. All the Mossad operatives returned safely to Israel. And no one was arrested or even accurately named. 
Over the years, some stories about Kidon's prowess have leaked to the public. With the little that was known 
about them, The Team's operatives were considered synonymous—in Israel and outside—with assassins, liquidators, 
and murderers. 
More broadly, there is a Mossad mythology that is based on decades of half-truths and rumors. Many of those 
stemmed from the secret agency's "war of the spooks" against Palestinian radicals in the 1970s all over Europe—as a 
response to the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the Summer Olympic games in Munich, Germany, in September of 
1972. 
"Our attitude was that in order to defend ourselves, we have to go on the attack," former Mossad chief Zvi 
Zamir told us. 'Those who accuse us of being motivated simply by revenge are talking nonsense. We didn't wage a 
vendetta campaign against individuals. It was a war against an organization, aiming to halt and prevent concrete 
terrorist plans. We concentrated on what was expected to happen."
