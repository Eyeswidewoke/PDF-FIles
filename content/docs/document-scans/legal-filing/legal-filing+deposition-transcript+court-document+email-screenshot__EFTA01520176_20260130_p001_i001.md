Important Information Regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily. 
weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In a 
failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements. Accordingly, Investors should not rely on pricing 
information appearing in their statements with respect to ARS.
