a way that lead to manifest conflict with the body of experimental evidence that supports the 
postulate that physical interactions are local. An important question to resolve is whether these 
non-localities compromise the interpretation of experiments underway in which (1) is tested, such 
as in observations of gamma ray bursts by the Fermi satellite[5]. 
The present paper has two aims. The first is to study the description of processes in which 
gamma rays are emitted and detected, as it appears in frames of reference moving with respect 
to the detectors. We carry this out in a well studied approach to DSR, which is tc—tvlinkowslci 
spacetime[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24]. We find that while there are no macroscopic non-localities 
seen by observers close to the detecor, there are issues with ambiguities in coordinates of distant 
events. 
The second aim of this paper is to propose a new feature of theories which incorporate de-
formations of special relativity, which is a limitation on the spatial extent to which an inertial 
frame can be defined, coming from ambiguities in the procedure for synchronizing clocks which 
arise due to the non-commutativity of the spacetime geometry or to the energy dependence of the 
speed of light (1). In special relativity the coordinates of an inertial frame are defined in terms of 
a single clock at the origin, and exchanges of light signals are used to define coordinates for dis-
tant events. As we show here, this procedure breaks down in K-Minwkowski spacetime, so that 
ambiguities can appear in the coordinates assigned to distant events. This novel effect is a kind of 
uv/ir mixing, applied to the operational definition of spacetime coordinates. As a consequence, 
the ambiguities in the coordinates of distant events are not signals of real physical non-localities, 
and there is no conflict with experimental evidence for locality on macroscopic scales. 
These conclusions differ from those of [6], which however works in a different framework, 
based on different assumptions. The reasons for, and consequences of, this disagreement are ex-
plored in an Appendix. 
In the next section we discuss the description of a detector of gamma rays arriving from a dis-
tant burst, from the point of view of an observer moving relative to the detector, in ,c-Minkoski 
spacetime. In section 3 we discuss the attribution of coordinates to events far from the origin of a 
lorentz frame and propose that ambiguities in the coordinates are to be understood as coordinate 
ambiguities rather than physical non-localities. In section 4 this view is supported by an anal-
ysis of Einstein's procedure for the synchronization of moving clocks, applied to sc-Minkowksi 
spacetime. This section closes with some general remarks about the physical interpretation of rel-
ativistic but non-commuting spacetimes. In the conclusion we comment on the present status of 
the issues discussed here. 
2 Gamma ray bursts and moving observers 
The focus of this paper is an experiment in which photons from gamma ray bursts are observed to 
arrive near Earth. Such experiments are of interest because they have already been used to test the 
hypothesis of an energy dependence of the speed of light, eq (1) [5]. We will be interested in how 
the experiment is described in terms of the coordinates constructed by different inertial frames, in 
order to understand the implications for it of the hypothesis that DSR preserves the relativity of 
inertial frames. 
We first describe the experiment in an inertial reference frame which can be assumed to be at 
rest on the Earth and to have its origin situated at a detector on the Earth. We will call this Alice's
