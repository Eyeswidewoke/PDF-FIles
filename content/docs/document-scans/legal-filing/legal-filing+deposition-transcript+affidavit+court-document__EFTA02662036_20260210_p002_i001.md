Your family office needs a daddy. child=en with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking with lit=le 
direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry=C2 Delson to take charge Everyone would report to 
him. Eileen included. He would ho=ever work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice =s I prefer only being 
responsible and standing behind my own persona= work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be transmitt=d to reflect 
status stated by others ) 
=C2 With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have=C2 failed in my attempt in trying to think 
through th= problem creatively . My =AO organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you might f=nd 
very costly, very ! ( however many structures availab=e some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my 
teams doing the work , no= yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrat=r. not sure what role you prefer for 
Eileen as you hired her i=itially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller s=ays or not, is not urgent. 
having Tom report to a new person,-=is. coordination with Suydam Kathy Gregory, I =ould suggest limiting to one 
person. The increasing public profile n=eds to be taken into consideration. 
TODAY 
=br> With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to =A0Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continu=d to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows, stock accts, s=ructures. sales Etc) and me. and each time with 
my many annoyi=g calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g 
y !!=C2 No one was hired to run YOUR 
office until two months ago , no one wa= even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very nice man, is n=t even full 
time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent traini=g him . and his new staff. Eileen followed your 
instructions. not m=ne. in fact she continued to ignore mine saying " but Leo= said " or " its on Leon's desk etc " , =A0 
You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance. of =er obfuscation. originally you were given the clear 
choice, b=t to save money ,you chose not to hire my team . I was hired to do t=e architecture, you kept your own team. 
with Eileen at the=head. instructions were given by me„ detailed but ignored by=her. ( except in the instances where I 
inserted myself and personally had =o do the weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm m=rgan acct still not in use? That being 
said, If you do the =AO cold calculation ,starting from where you were, to where you are =urrently . you have made a 
hell of a deal. -- =AO negotiating down my original amount requested , calling upo= our friendship and suggesting that 
the Carlyn mess was partially my fault. ( though in that specific example , I had nev=r been asked to do more than 
merely provide you the name of the mos= highly recognized atty in the field, not cons=lted,nor even asked again for 
my guidance along the way.= ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by =he way „suggesting now, that your Tom 
is now that last word on tax =haracterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in =he past. 
In order to move fo=ward 
I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours,=C2 My business is only comprised of my personal attention and 
my =ersonal time . Time that I was forced to grossly o=erspend on your various issues last year. . As you are my very 
=close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I =C2 have decided i will have this year for my time 
. (hopeful=y a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in m=nd that though our deal expired months 
ago. (also keeping in mind , =hat your understanding of the final payment terms neither reflected =he emails or my 
memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answere= every call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . r=viewed docs 
over and over/ until once again, I was forced to=C2 insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to.=C2 I made 
serious dollar and time concessions last year.very serious =C2 I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your 
concerns ,=but I am, under no circumstances , none, willing to spend my t=me for free. its not fair. After cleaning up 
Carlyn's mess , which was=a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly=aware of the dire circumstances 
in which you found yourself last year, and=in fact due predominately to its seriousness. and those very c=rcumstances I 
took extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed =1 had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my very 
clos= friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the=near future, another barrel will appear of your 
own design ) =C2 
I heard you when you said you believed i had already been p=id for the work that is now required. The art partnership 
has fully =nswered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more=so.. ( FYI Carlyns art 
partnership=that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) =A0You will also =ecall that you required that my 
payments be at the end of my work not at t=e beginning as everyone else's .( my work was never to include h=urs upon 
hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, t=is of course should make clear that the 2014 tax y=ar that will 
close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at =11. I pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a
