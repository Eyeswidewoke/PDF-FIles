suggest that Iran is inclined to suspend i=s nuclear program or relinquish the critical components of such a 
program.=They are, however, more open to dialogue than the Ahmadinejad government w=s. Moreover, they stress 
that a reasonable Iran can assuage U.S. concerns =bout its nuclear development without having to abandon the 
program. 
Despite its softened rhetoric, the new Iranian regime can be expected to co=tinue asserting its nuclear "rights" and to 
press its advantages in a =ontested Middle East. The Islamic Republic plans to remain an important ba=ker of the Assad 
dynasty in Syria, a benefactor of Hezbollah and a support=r of Palestinian rejectionist groups. It will persist in its 
repressive ta=tics at home and continue to deny the people of Iran fundamental human rig=ts. This is a government that 
will seek to negotiate a settlement of the n=clear issue by testing the limits of the great powers' prohibitions. 
Washington need not accede to such Iranian conceptions. The United States a=d its allies are entering this week's 
negotiations in a strong position.=Iran's economy is withering<http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/irans-
au=omakers-stalled-by-sanctions/2013/10/14/515725aa-3261-11e3-ad00-ec4c6b3lcb=d_story.html> under the 
combined pressures of sanctions and its own manage=ial incompetence. The Iranian populace remains disaffected as 
the bonds be=ween state and society have been largely severed since the Green Revolutio= of 2009. The European 
Union is still highly skeptical of Iran, a distrust=that Rouhani's charm offensive has mitigated but not eliminated. Allied 
=iplomats can use as leverage in the forthcoming negotiations the threat of=additional sanctions and Israeli military 
force. 
Given the stark realities, it is time for the great powers to have a maxima=ist approach to diplomacy with Iran. It is too 
late for more Iranian half-=teps and half-measures. Tehran must account for all its illicit nuclear ac=ivities and be 
compelled to make irreversible concessions that permanently=degrade its ability to reconstitute its nuclear weapons 
program at a more =onvenient time. Anything less would be a lost opportunity.

Foreign Policy 
Six reasons why the United States can't force Iran's nuclear hand 
Colin H. Kahl, Alireza Nader 
October 14, 2013 -- Iranian president Hasan Rouhani's recent charm offensiv= has raised expectations for a diplomatic 
breakthrough heading into this w=ek's nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States, Britain, Chi=a, France, 
Germany, and Russia (the so-called P5+1) in Geneva. Sanctions h=ve taken a heavy toll on the Iranian economy, and the 
Islamic Republic may=finally be motivated to take steps to rein in its nuclear program, includi=g accepting limits on 
uranium enrichment, in exchange for lessening the pr=ssure. 
Hawks in Israel and Washington, however, have been quick to describe Rouhan= as a "wolf in sheep's 
clothing<http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013=10/04/bibi_netanyahu_missing_cartoon_posters_iran_nuclear_t 
hreat>," warnin= that the Iranian regime may agree to "cosmetic changes" to its nuclear pr=gram in exchange for 
sanctions relief, but ultimately will do little to co=strain its quest for the bomb. In particular, they have cautioned the 
Obam= administration against acquiescing to an agreement that allows Iran to co=tinue any domestic uranium 
enrichment, even at low levels suitable only fo= civilian nuclear power and under stringent international supervision. In 
=is Oct. 1 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, for example, Israeli Prime =inister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that 
only a complete dismantling of Ir=n's enrichment program could prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapon=. This 
position has been echoed by conservative think tanks in Washington =nd by numerous voices on Capitol Hill. Their 
collective mantra: "a bad dea= is worse than no deal." 
Attempting to keep Iran as far away from nuclear weapons as possible by ins=sting on "zero enrichment" seems 
sensible. But in reality, the quest for t=e optimal deal would doom diplomacy with Iran, making the far worse outcom=s 
of unconstrained Iranian nuclearization or a military showdown over Tehr=n's nuclear program much more likely. 
Uranium enrichment is one pathway to producing bomb-grade explosive materia= for nuclear weapons, and all else 
being equal, it is easier to verify the=total absence of such activities than different gradations of them. Of cou=se, it 
would clearly be preferable if Iran ended its uranium enrichment ac=ivities altogether. Moreover, most countries with 
civilian nuclear power p=ants forgo domestic enrichment, so it seems reasonable to demand the same =f Tehran.
