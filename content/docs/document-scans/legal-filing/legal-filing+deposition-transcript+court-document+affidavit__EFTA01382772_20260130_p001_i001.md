S-1/A 
Table of Contrail 
Dividends 
Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder of our Class A common stock generally will be subject to withholding of United States federal 
income tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. However, dividends that are effectively 
connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax 
treaty, are attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the non-U.S. holder) are not subject to the 
withholding tax, provided certain certification and disclosure requirements are satisfied. Instead, such dividends are subject to United States federal 
income tax on a net income basis generally in the same manner as if the non-U.S. holder were a United States person as defined under the Code. 
Any such effectively connected dividends received by a foreign corporation may be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a 30% rate or 
such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. 
A non-U.S. holder of our Class A common stock who wishes to claim the benefit of an applicable treaty rate and avoid backup 
withholding. as discussed below, for dividends will be required (a) to complete an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, 
as applicable, and certify under penalty of perjury that such holder is not a United States person as defined under the Code and is eligible for treaty 
benefits or (b) if our Class A common stock is held through certain foreign intermediaries, to satisfy the relevant certification requirements of 
applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special certification and other requirements apply to certain non-U.S. holders that are pass-through 
entities rather than corporations or individuals. 
A non-U.S. holder of our Class A common stock eligible for a reduced rate of United States withholding tax pursuant to an income tax 
treaty may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. 
Gain on Disposition of Class A Common Stock 
My gain realized on the taxable disposition of our Class A common stock generally will not be subject to United States federal income 
tax unless: 
• 
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable 
income tax treaty. is attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the non-U.S. holder); 
• 
the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition. and 
certain other conditions are met; or 
• 
we are or have been a "United States real property holding corporation" for United States federal income tax purposes. 
An individual non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax on the net gain derived from 
the disposition under regular graduated United States federal income tax rates. An individual non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point 
immediately above will be subject to a flat 30% tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain derived 
from the disposition, which may be offset by United States source capital losses, even though the individual is not considered a resident of the 
United States. If a non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation falls under the first bullet point immediately above, it will be subject to tax on its 
net gain generally in the same manner as if it were a United States person as defined under the Code and, in addition. may be subject to the branch 
profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) of its effectively connected earnings and 
profits, subject to adjustments. 
We believe we are not and do not anticipate becoming a "United States real property holding corporation" for United States federal 
income tax purposes.
