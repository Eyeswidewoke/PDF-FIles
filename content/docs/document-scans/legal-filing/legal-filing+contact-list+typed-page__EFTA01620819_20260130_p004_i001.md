other 'lower land plant groups. As such, dual partnerships are the 
norm in basal thalloid liverworts, while more derived clades have, 
like ferns, the specificity to Glomeromycota typical of later vascular 
plant lineages (Smith & Read, 2008). Together with the occurrence 
of multiple fungal associations in Devonian plants (Strullu-Derrien 
mat, 2014), this lends further weight to the notion of shifting 
symbiotic encounters between early land colonists and soil-
dwelling fungi before the Glomeromycota became dominant. 
The presence of Mucoromycotina in Anogramma may be a recent 
reacquisition, on a par with Endogone forming ectomycorrhizas 
with pines (Walker, 1985), and probably relates to its unique life 
cycle among ferns — comprising short-lived sporophytes and 
aestivating tubers (Goebel, 1905). It is also possible that associa-
tions with Mucoromycotina in lycopods and other plants represent 
recent acquisitions. However, this seems unlikely, given that the 
genes required for mycorrhiza formation in angiosperms are highly 
conserved across major plant lineages and that mycorrhizal genes 
from Mucoromycotina-associated Haplomitriopsida liverworts 
recovered the Glomeromycota mycorrhizal phenotype in a trans-
formed mutant of the angiosperm Medicago minnow& (Wang 
mat, 2010). These finding', coupled with the occurrence of 
Mucoromycotina in extant basal groups of both nonvascular and 
vascular plants. as well as fossil plants (Strullu-Derrien et 
2014), 
indicate that associations between Mucoromycotina and land 
plants are extremely ancient. 
During this investigation, we examined sporophytes only and it 
would be desirable now to study the cryptic nonphotosynthetic 
gametophytes of a range of lycopods and ferns, which are expected 
to be more heavily and consistently colonized by fungi (Read eta!, 
2000; Ogura-Tsujita et al, 2013). Nevertheless, our discovery that 
lycopods enter into partnerships with both Mucoromycotina and 
Glomeromycota fungi opens a new chapter in understanding the 
origins and evolution of fungal symbioses in vascular plants. 
Functional studies into the nature of these associations, like those 
conducted by Field etal. (2014) on Haplomitriopsida—Mucoro-
mycotina symbioses, are now needed.
