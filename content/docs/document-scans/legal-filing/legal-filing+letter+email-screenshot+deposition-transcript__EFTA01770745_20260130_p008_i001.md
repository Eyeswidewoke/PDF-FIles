Tensions increased dramatically when Mashal signed the unity agreement with Fatah, after stating his intention to 
resign as head of the political bureau. While that announcement may have been political blackmail aimed at forcing 
Gaza into line, it underscored Mashal's confidence in his popularity, which has since been vindicated by expressions of 
support from both within and outside of the political bureau for him to remain in charge. 
Mashal has more than one option. He may reemerge as the head of a newly established Palestinian branch of the 
Muslim Brotherhood, or as a leader of a new Islamist political party under the umbrella of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. Such a merging of Hamas with the established Palestinian political organizations would signify Hamas's 
formal acceptance of a two-state solution, and would mark an important step in transforming the movement. 
For the West, using the opportunity to influence Hamas's future course requires modifying the failed policy of all-
encompassing rejection. As in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, Islamist moderates in the Palestinian territories need to be 
engaged as a legitimate political force. Leaders such as Mashal, who has expressed a readiness to forsake alliances with 
Syria and Iran and to accept a two-state solution with Israel, should be bolstered rather than boycotted. That means 
supporting the ongoing effort to form an interim Palestinian government of technocrats, as stipulated in the Qatar 
agreement. 
At times, such an approach will be challenging; Hamas will undoubtedly prove to be a difficult counterpart. But the 
United States, European governments, and Israel should take this opportunity to engage Hamas's moderates and test 
their flexibility. In the new Middle East, the West's current approach will only strengthen the hardliners in Gaza and 
elsewhere.

Egypt Stands to Lose More Than Aid 
Stephen McInerney 
February 22, 2012 -- This weekend, the fracas over foreigners in Cairo is set to escalate when hearings begin against 43 
workers (including 16 U.S. citizens) charged with operating without a license, receiving unauthorized foreign funds, and 
engaging in political activity. The drama is seven months in the making. Last July, Egypt's Ministry of Justice opened an 
investigation into the activities and funding of numerous (possibly as many as 400) nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs). The move came at the behest of Fayza Abul Naga, minister of planning and international cooperation. In the 
months that followed, her department refused to officially state or confirm any details of the wide-ranging probe. Then, 
in late December, Egyptian security forces raided the offices of several of the NGOs under investigation. And what began 
as an effort by one Egyptian minister to assert her control has turned into a game of international brinkmanship that has 
the potential to upend the security calculus of the Middle East. 
After tensions escalated in December, numerous members of Congress made clear that the actions of the Egyptian 
government could jeopardize the annual $1.55 billion aid package to Egypt -- the United States' second largest, after the
