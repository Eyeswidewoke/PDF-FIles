The evolutionarily older systems also 
play a role in human information 
processing and behavior, albeit in a more 
rigid and stereotyped fashion. The 
intricately interconnected neocortical 
regions of the frontal lobes are involved 
in self control, which permits the 
modulation of these older systems and 
the overriding of organismal hedonistic 
impulses for the benefit of others (15). 
Evidence across human history 
provides overwhelming support for the 
supposition that humans are 
fundamentally social creatures (13). 
Even in contemporary times in which 
autonomy is revered, the average person 
has been estimated to spend nearly 80% 
of waking hours in the company of 
others, most of which is spent in small 
talk with known individuals (16). These 
estimates have been supported in more 
detailed assessment using the day-
reconstruction method to determine how 
people spend their time and how they 
experienced events in their lives on a 
daily basis (17). The results of these 
daily assessments indicate people spend 
only 3.4 hrs alone, or approximately 
20% of their waking hours. The time 
spent with friends, relatives, spouse, 
children, clients, and coworkers is rated 
on average as more inherently rewarding 
than the time spent alone (17). 
Respondents indicate that their 
most enjoyable activities are intimate 
relations and socializing — activities that 
promote bonding and high quality 
relationships, whereas their least 
enjoyable activities are commuting and 
working. These results are consistent 
with survey data. When asked "what is 
necessary for happiness?" the majority 
of respondents rate "relationships with 
family and friends" as most important 
(18), although we certainly do not 
always act like this is most important. It 
is surprisingly easy to overlook the 
evident. 
Noticing the Unusual, Overlooking the 
Obvious 
On January IS, 2009, US 
Airways Flight 1549 departed from New 
York's LaGuardia Airport for Charlotte, 
North Carolina when it struck a flock of 
geese during takeoff. Both engines were 
disabled, and the heavy aircraft quickly 
lost the power it needed to stay aloft, but 
Capt. Chesley Sullenberger somehow 
managed a controlled descent into the 
Hudson River. The media dubbed the 
ditching of the plane and the survival of 
all 155 passengers and crew the miracle 
on the Hudson, and Sullenberger was 
duly heralded as a hero. The ability to 
control the descent of an 84-ton plane 
without engine thrust is not something 
with which humans are naturally 
endowed. Sullenberger was not a 
novice, of course. He is a U.S. Air 
Force Academy graduate who flew F-4 
fighter planes while in the Air Force, has 
40 years of flight experience, and holds a 
commercial glider license and glider 
instructor rating. As remarkable as was 
his achievement relative to what one 
might normally expect in this situation, 
however, Sullenberger's efforts were not 
sufficient for the miracle on the Hudson 
to be achieved. 
When Flight 1549 came to a stop 
in the frigid Hudson River, the 
passengers and crew scrambled to the 
wings and inflatable slides of their 
slowly sinking aircraft. Local 
commercial vessels from the New York 
Waterway and Circle Line fleets 
responded almost immediately, with the 
first of the vessels reaching the plane 
within four minutes. The crews of the 
various vessels worked together to 
rescue the passengers and crew of Flight
