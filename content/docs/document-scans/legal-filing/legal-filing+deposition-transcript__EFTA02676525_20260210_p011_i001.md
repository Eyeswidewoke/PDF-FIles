Section III: Verbatim Comments on Aaron Butcher 
Note: Individual comments separated by horizontal tines 
STRENGTHS: 
Personality, Aaron is a very fun person to fly with and I only heard good things about him from the other pilots. He has no 
ego, and is very humble. Work Ethic, Aaron has a strong work ethic, he goes above and beyond the call of duty, and does 
more than he is asked if the situtation deems it necessary. Attention to detail. Aaron was always very good at completing flight 
logs and expense reports that were accurate and precise. He was sure to have the aircraft in presentable condition, and was 
sure to leave it that way when the flight was over. 
Great personality, easy to work with, nice person 
Aaron is professional, courteous, and detail-oriented. I have spent a lot of time on the flight deck and on the road with Aaron. 
He has always been a pleasure t0 fly with and is truly a remarkable captain and a great person. He is thoughtful, personable, 
and charismatic. Aaron is extremely meticulous and thorough and has strong attention to detail, which greatly enhances his 
customer service skill set. 
Aaron has flown as a Gulfstream Captain for my company and Part 91 contract aircraft for several years. He has always 
demonstrated a high degree of competency and professionalism. His extensive international experience and excellence in 
customer service are at the upper levels that I demand from my flight crews. He has an excellent knowledge of Gulfstream 
aircrafts, their safety systems, and operational characteristics. I have personally flown with Aaron on multiple occasions and 
found his skills and discipline in the cockpit to be exemplary. 
One of the best Captains that we had at Pegasus. I never had an issue of concern with safety or performance. I would love to 
fly with Aaron again. 
COULD IMPROVE: 
It would be hard for me to comment on ways Aaron could improve his performance. He was one of the best performing pilots 
we had at the time. I only wish I could have found more pilots like him. 
Keep Aaron motivated, driven and set goals 
I have had the privilege of flying with Aaron Butcher for several years. Aaron is not only an excellent pilot, but he has an 
unsurpassed knowledge of aviation and his aircraft. Aaron has always proven himself and outstanding teammate, and has 
always operated the aircraft with the highest regard for safety and the well-being of his passengers and crew. I cannot make 
any recommendations on how Aaron may improve his work performance. 
Aaron has always followed SOPs per our company and CAE training. 
Aaron constantly strived to strengthen his knowledge in all aspects of his performance.
