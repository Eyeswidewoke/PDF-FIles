2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87203, * 
light on the events surrounding the non-prosecution agreement, which are central to the 
victims' arguments that the U.S. Attorney's Office violated their rights." (Id. at 5, 6). The 
Court granted Petitioners' request and ['4] ordered the Government to "[p]roduce 
responsive documents in response to all outstanding requests for production of documents 
encompassing any documentary material exchanged by or between the federal 
government and persons or entities outside the federal government (including without 
limitation all correspondence generated by or between the federal government and 
Epstein's attorneys)" (DE 190 at 2). The Court also ordered the Government to produce all 
responsive documents "other than communications generated between the federal 
government and outside persons or entities." (Id.). If the Government claimed privilege 
over any of these documents, the Court ordered the Government to (1) file "a privilege log 
clearly identifying each document[] by author(s), addressee(s), recipients(s), date, and 
general subject matter and such other identifying data," and (2) to "submit all responsive 
documents withheld on claim of privilege to the court for in camera inspection." (Id.). 
The Government produced 1,357 pages of documents to Petitioners, filed three privilege 
logs, and submitted nearly 15,000 pages to the Court for in camera inspection. (See DE 
257 at 2). The Government asserts that the documents submitted ['5] for in camera 
inspection are privileged for reasons such as the privacy rights of non-party victims, grand 
jury secrecy under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e),' and the attorney--client, work 
product, deliberative process, and investigative privileges. (DEs 212-1; 216-1, 329-1). 
Moreover, with the Court's leave (DE 257 at 4), the Government objects to the relevancy of 
several of Petitioners' requests for production (DE 260). 
1 In a previous ruling, the Court noted that Plaintiffs formally requested the release of grand jury materials, but the Court 
reserved "ruling as to whether the materials in question are protected from disclosure by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 
6(e)." (DE 257 at 3). 
II. Discussion 
District courts have "broad discretion in shaping the scope of discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 
26(b)." Williams v. City of Dothan, 745 F.2d 1406, 1415 (11th Cir. 1984). The Court will 
first address matters related to whether a privilege protects the submitted documents from 
discovery and then tum to whether any otherwise non-privileged documents are relevant to 
Petitioners' CVRA case. Specific rulings as to the submitted documents are found in the 
Table appended to this Opinion and Order. 
A. Privilege Assertions 
1. Challenge to the Sufficiency of Government's Privilege Assertions 
Petitioners raise several general objections to the Government's ['6] privilege logs. They 
argue that the Government's logs are inadequate because they do not "clearly identify" the 
documents as ordered by this Court. (DE 265 at 2; DE 190 at 2). The Court has reviewed 
the Government's privilege logs and the documents that they describe, and the Court finds 
that the logs--describing nearly 15,000 pages of documents--are adequate to facilitate a 
meaningful in camera inspection and assessment of the asserted privileges. To the extent
