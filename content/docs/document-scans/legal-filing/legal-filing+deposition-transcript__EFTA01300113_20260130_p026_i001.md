Emirates Business 24/7 
One of the many effective measures taken by the UAE Government to deal with the fallout 
of the global financial crisis has been to maintain or increase spending on infrastructure 
projects, even if this leads to a deficit budget. Would the LJAE be comfortable with a deficit 
budget for the first time in many years? Would you immediately put in place measures to 
wipe out the deficit (if that happens) in the next year? What such measures would you 
consider? 
This is a hypothetical question. Actually, we evaluate all possible scenarios and we are very keen on endorsing a 
deficit-free budget. Yet I can read between the lines of your question about potential measures to face budget 
deficit. My reply is: No Income Taxes.

The public relations image of UAE and Dubai is being taken to task in sections of the 
Western press. What is the official strategy of UAE going to be to counter this? 
Our strategy in that regard is very consistent, as we strongly believe in the sanctity of truth. Our commitment to 
transparency is unequivocal and unquestioned. Our ultimate response to these reports can be seen in our 
relentless efforts and ongoing success. The life sp an of lies is always short. 
We have been very transparent with all measures undertaken over the past few months to counter the impact of 
the global financial crisis. Senior government officials have spoken openly about the current situation, 
highlighting key facts and figures -- including the actual size of the debts by both the government and government 
affiliated companies. 
His Highness the President of the UAE has also openly clarified different dimensions of the crisis's impact on the 
UAE economy. Despite all that, some people in the media have continued to weave rumors and negative 
speculation into their articles. We welcome all media from around the globe and we have never silenced any 
resident or visiting reporters or stopped them from doing their job. 
We shall continue to do the same because of our confidence in ourselves, our economy and our measures — and 
because we always believe deep in our hearts that truth prevails. Yet our self-confidence does not stop us from 
dialogue with the media to offer them straightforward information. We urge them to adhere to professional 
integrity, objectivity, and fair scrutiny and use of information.

There has been some contraction in business volumes in the UAE over the last few months. 
The harshest effect of this seems to have been on small and medium-sized enterprises. Is 
there any plan to revitalize the small business sector, which is usually co nsidered the 
growth engine of an economy? 
We are fully aware of the vital role of the small and medium enterprises sector; I believe that the contraction it 
has suffered is only temporary. Our success in overcoming the worst will positively reflect on the overall 
economy, including major enterprises as well as small and medium-sized ones. Our position is far better than
