DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED SECURITIES GUARANTEE 
Concurrently with the issuance by the trust of its preferred securities, we will execute and deliver a preferred 
securities guarantee for the benefit of the holders from time to time of such preferred securities. The property 
trustee will act as indenture trustee under the preferred securities guarantee for the purposes of compliance with 
the Trust Indenture Act, and the preferred securities guarantee will be qualified as an indenture under the Trust 
Indenture Act. In this prospectus, we refer to the property trustee acting as indenture trustee under the preferred 
securities guarantee as the "guarantee trustee." The following is a summary of the material terms and provisions 
of the preferred securities guarantee. You should refer to the form of preferred securities guarantee and the Trust 
Indenture Act for more complete information regarding the provisions of the preferred securities guarantee, 
including the definitions of some of the terms used below. The form of the preferred securities guarantee has 
been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and is incorporated by 
reference in this summary. Whenever particular sections or defined terms of a preferred securities guarantee are 
referred to, such sections or defined terms are incorporated herein by reference, and the statement in connection 
with which such reference is made is qualified in its entirety by such reference. Reference in this summary to 
preferred securities means the trust's preferred securities to which a preferred securities guarantee relates. The 
guarantee trustee will hold the preferred securities guarantee for the benefit of the holders of the related trust's 
preferred securities. 
General 
We will irrevocably agree to pay in full on a subordinated basis, to the extent described herein, the 
Guarantee Payments without duplication of amounts theretofore paid by or on behalf of the trust, to the holders 
of the preferred securities, as and when due, regardless of any defense, right of setoff or counterclaim that the 
trust may have or assert other than the defense of payment. The following Guarantee Payments with respect to 
the preferred securities, to the extent not paid by or on behalf of the related trust, will be subject to the preferred 
securities guarantee: 
• 
any accrued and unpaid distributions required to be paid on such preferred securities, to the extent that 
the trust has funds on hand available for payment at such time; 
• 
the redemption price, including all accrued and unpaid distributions to the redemption date, with 
respect to any preferred securities called for redemption. to the extent that the trust has funds on hand 
available for payment at such time; and 
upon a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding•up or liquidation of the trust, unless the 
corresponding subordinated debt securities are distributed to holders of such preferred securities, the 
lesser of (a) the Liquidation Distribution, to the extent the trust has funds available for payment at such 
time, and (b) the amount of assets of the trust remaining available for distribution to holders of 
preferred securities. 
Our obligation to make a Guarantee Payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts by 
us to the holders of the preferred securities or by causing the trust to pay such amounts to such holders. (Section 
5.1) 
The preferred securities guarantee will be an irrevocable guarantee on a subordinated basis of the trust's 
payment obligations under the preferred securities, but will apply only to the extent that such trust has funds 
sufficient to make such payments. The preferred securities guarantee is, to that extent, a guarantee of payment 
and not a guarantee of collection. 
If we do not make interest payments on the corresponding subordinated debt securities held by the trust, the 
trust will not be able to pay distributions on the preferred securities and will not have funds legally available for 
payment. The preferred securities guarantee will rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to all other 
Indebtedness of ours, including all debt securities, except those ranking equally or subordinate by their terms.
