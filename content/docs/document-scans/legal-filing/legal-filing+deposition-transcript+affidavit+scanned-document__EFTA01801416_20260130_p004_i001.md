The Psycholog= of Barack Obama 
Robert W. M=rry <http://nationalinterest.org/profile/rober=-w-merry-0> 
October 16, 2013-- =n 1972, Duke University professor James David Barber brought out a book th=t immediately was 
heralded as a seminal study of presidential character. T=tled The Presidential Character: Predicting Performance in the 
White House, the book looked at qualities of temperamen= and personality in assessing how the country's chief 
executives approac=ed the presidency—and how that in turn contributed to their success or f=ilure in the office. 
Although there were=flaws in Barber's approach, particularly in his efforts to typecast the =ersonalities of various 
presidents, it does indeed lay before us an intere=ting and worthy matrix for assessing how various presidents approach 
the job and the ultimate quality of their =eadership. So let's apply the Barber matrix to the presidential incumben=, 
Barack Obama. 
Barber, who died in=2004, assessed presidents based on two indices: first, whether they were &=uot;positive" or 
"negative"; and, second, whether they were="active" or "passive." The first index—the positive/=egative one—assesses 
how presidents regarded themselves in relation to the chall=nges of the office; so, for example, did they embrace the 
job with a joyfu= optimism or regard it as a necessary martyrdom they must sustain in order=to prove their own self-
worth? The second index—active vs. passive—measures their degree of wanting to ac=omplish big things or retreat into 
a reactive governing mode. 
These two indices p=oduce four categories of presidents, to wit: 
Active-Positive: Th=se are presidents with big national ambitions who are self-confident, flex=ble, optimistic, joyful in 
the exercise of power, possessing a certain phi=osophical detachment toward what they regard as a great game. 
Active-Negative: Th=se are compulsive people with low self-esteem, seekers of power as a means=of self-actualization, 
given to rigidity and pessimism, driven, sometimes =verly aggressive. But they harbor big dreams for bringing about 
accomplishments of large historical dimension.</=pan> 
Passive-Positive: T=ese are compliant presidents who react to events rather than initiating th=m. They want to be loved 
and are thus ingratiating—and easily manipulate=. They are "superficially optimistic" and harbor generally modest 
ambitions for their presidential years. But th=y are healthy in both ego and self-esteem. 
Passive-Negative: T=ese are withdrawn people with low self-esteem and little zest for the give=and-take of politics and 
the glad-handing requirements of the game. They a=oid conflict and take no joy in the uses of power. They tend to get 
themselves boxed up through a preoccupatio= with principles, rules and procedures. 
When Barber first p=t forth this matrix, it was correctly viewed as distinctively probing and =riginal. And there is little 
doubt that such traits, if correctly identifi=d and analyzed, can inform our assessments of how presidents do their job. 
But there is plenty of room for debate whe= it comes to attaching particular traits to particular presidents.<=p> 
For example, do we =eally want to place George Washington in the Passive-Negative category, as=Barber does? Did he 
have low self-esteem? Did he avoid power and shrink fr=m conflict? Did he concentrate on small matters—procedures, 
etc.—at the expense of the big matters? Hardly. An= my favorite mismatch was Barber's insertion of Ronald Reagan into 
the P=ssive-Positive category, meaning his famous optimism was merely superficia=, that he reacted to events rather 
than initiating them, that he was easily manipulated. 
No, Reagan clearly =as an Active-Positive who transformed the economic debate in America, inje=ted profoundly new 
thinking into the body politic, and set about not just =o counter the Soviet threat but to upend the Soviet Union itself.
