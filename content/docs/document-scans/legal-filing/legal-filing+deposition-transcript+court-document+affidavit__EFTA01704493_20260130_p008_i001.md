Important Sign & Travel and/or Extended Payment Option Information 
Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADO) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the 
ADB method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we calculate the FC on your Account by applying the 
Daily Periods Rote (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) (inducing current transactions). To get the ADB, we (1) 
take the begiming balance for each day (includng unpaid FC from previous billing periods), (2) add any new 
transactions, debris or fees, (3) subtract any payments or credits credited as of that day, and (4) make any appropriate 
adjustments. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the 
previous days daily balance multiplied by the DPR. This gives us the daily balance for that day and the beginning 
balance for the next day. If this balance is negative, It is consdered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances 
for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the being period. This gives us the ADS. The ADS for 
a billing period will be considered zero it you paid the total New Balance, if any, shown on your previous tilling 
statement by the Closing Date of the current billing period. If you multiply the ADB by the number of days in the tilling 
period and the DPR, the result will be the FC assessed, except for vanations caused by rounding. This method of 
calculating the ADC and FO results in daily compounding of FC. The information on page 2 of your statement
