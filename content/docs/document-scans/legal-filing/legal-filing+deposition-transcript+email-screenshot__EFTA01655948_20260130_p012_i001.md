Director Bongino said this week the agency is set to release batches of documents to bring about "accountability." 
The pair promised there would be a "truckload" of long-withheld internal files during their pretaped appearance 
on Sunday Morning Futures. According to the article, Congressional Republicans and legal experts say critical 
questions remain unresolved, particularly those involving accountability for surveillance abuses, informant usage, 
and what role senior Obama-era officials may have played in politicized investigations. Pressure and hope are 
escalating over whether the Bureau's latest trove of records releases can clear up those outstanding inquiries. 
GOP U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran Not Tossing Political Softballs at Director Patel, USDA Secretary 
The Kansas Reflector (05/21, Carpenter) reported that Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran pressed Trump 
administration officials on federal budget and personnel decisions by framing inquiries in terms of potential threats 
to the farm economy and public safety in Kansas. Director Patel and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary 
Brooke Rollins were on the receiving end of Moran's questions during recent Senate hearings. According to the 
article, Moran inquired during an appropriations subcommittee hearing about implications of a recommended 
$545 million cut in expenditures that could eliminate 1,300 FBI jobs. The GOP senator said lawmakers were told 
reductions would be accomplished by ending duplicative intelligence gathering, initiatives tied to diversity, equity 
and inclusion, and projects championed by Democratic President Joe Biden. "Is that accurate?" Moran said. "Is that 
capable of being done? We can find this in what I suppose most people around here call waste, fraud and abuse? 
Or, does it have real consequences to the level of personnel and the capabilities of meeting the mission of the 
FBI?" The article added that Director Patel said the objective of reorganization at the FBI was to "make the mission 
work on whatever budget we're given." Moran said an overall force reduction at the federal law enforcement 
agency could weaken public safety in Kansas. "Fewer FBI special agents, intelligence analysts and professional staff 
could hinder the bureau in executing the president's commitment to making our communities safe," Moran said. 
"Our law enforcement, whether state, local or federal, keep our nation safe and carry out justice." 
Private Sperm Bank Admits to Giving Sperm Samples to FBI Without Donors' Knowledge 
LGBTQ Nation (OS/21, Sprayregen) reported that a representative of Seattle Sperm Bank admitted to selling unused 
sperm vials to the FBI during an industry conference, purportedly for the agency to research splat patterns. 
According to the article, the sources say the admission came from the representative — who one source identified 
as Seattle Sperm Bank General Supervisor Angelo Allard — during an October 2022 meeting at the California 
Cryobank campus in Los Angeles. A fertility expert who was also present in the room confirmed the story, saying 
they are "not sure what precipitated it" but that a "gentleman who was involved at a sperm bank raised his hand 
and basically said they sent sperm to the FBI at the request of the FBI for training purposes." The article stated that 
the outlet reached out to the National FBI office and received the following response from Seattle Field Office 
public affairs specialist Steven Bernd: "Our policy prohibits us, except in rare circumstances, from disclosing 
investigative techniques of an FBI investigation. However, I can plainly state that I did not find any information to 
suggest that the FBI has been purchasing sperm from a sperm bank." 
institute of Peace Reclaims Its Headquarters After Court Win Over Musk's Cost-Cutting Team 
The Associated Press (05/21, Fields) reported that the U.S. Institute of Peace retook control of its headquarters 
Wednesday, two days after a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Elon Musk's Department of 
Government Efficiency was illegal. According to the article, the institute's acting president, George Moose, entered 
the organization's headquarters with private security and the institute's outside attorney for the first time since 
being escorted off the premises during the DOGE takeover. Moose and most of the institute's board were fired in 
March, part of the mass slashing of the federal workforce spearheaded by Musk. The institute and many of its 
board members filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration soon after, seeking to prevent their removal and 
stop DOGE from taking over its operations. U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell's opinion on Monday reversed 
DOGE's actions. The saga began when Trump issued an executive order in February that targeted the institute and 
three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the government. 
The first attempt by DOGE to take over the headquarters led to a standoff. Members of Musk's DOGE group 
returned days later with the FBI and District of Columbia Metropolitan Police to help them gain entry. 
FBI Honors 102 Agents Who Died While Serving the Nation at Los Angeles Ceremony 
The Los Angeles Daily News (05/21, Staff Writer) reported that the FBI honored its own on Tuesday, May 20, in 
reverent ceremonies at the federal agency's Los Angeles field office on Wilshire Boulevard. The FBI's assistant 
director in charge in Los Angeles, Akil Davis, hosted the solemn memorial service to honor its agents and 
employees who lost their lives in the line of duty. LAPD Police Chief Jim McDonnell also helped to pay tribute to the
