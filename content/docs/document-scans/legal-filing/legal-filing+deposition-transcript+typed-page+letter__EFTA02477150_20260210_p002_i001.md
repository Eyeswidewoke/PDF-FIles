your=concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writ=ng in an attempt to lay out issues that I fear may

only weeks ago. = you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art partnersh=p on and on - into this year. and though the 60-
5040 timber emails =all carried with it a clear warning that you needed to do something re per=onnel if it were to 
stabilize,- you chose to wait.

Your family office needs a daddy. =AO children with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking=with little

Gre=ory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public p=ofile needs to be taken into consideration. 
TODAY=C2 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not rep=rt to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me), sh= continued to 
provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock =A0accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each time with my =any 
annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g=....y !! No one was hired to run YOUR office until 
two months ago , =o one was even interviewed and even now, Brad, a very nice man, =C2 is not even full time,(crazy ) 
Hours upon hours of time need to be s=ent training him . and his new staff. Eileen followed your instruct=ons. not 
mine. in fact she continued to ignore mine saying &qu=t; but Leon said " or " its on Leon's desk etc &q=ot; , You 
would become frustrated when i pointed out each ins=ance. of her obfuscation. originally you were given the clear 
=choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team . I was hir=d to do the architecture, you kept your own 
team. with Eileen=C2 at the head. instructions were given by me,  detailed bu= ignored by her. ( except in the 
instances where I inserted myself and per=onally had to do the weeks of grunt work ),ex. =A0jpm morgan acct still not 
in use? That being said, If yo= do the cold calculation ,starting from where you were, to whe=e you are currently . you

do more than merely provide you the n=me of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not =AO consulted,nor even
