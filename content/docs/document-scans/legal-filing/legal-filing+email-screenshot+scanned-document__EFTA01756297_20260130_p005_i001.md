Rouhani's diplomatic overtures are genuine, he has already succeede= in shifting international perceptions of Iran. If the 
United States, rath=r than Iran, comes across as the unreasonable party, it will become much m=re difficult to maintain 
the international coalition currently isolating t=e government in Tehran. Some fence sitters in Europe and Asia will start 
t= flirt with Iran again, leaving the United States in the untenable positio= of choosing between imposing sanctions on 
banks and companies in China, E=rope, India, Japan, or South Korea, or acquiescing to the erosion of the c=mprehensive 
sanctions regime. 
6. An uncompromising stance could drive Iran toward the bomb. 
Finally, if talks fail because the United States insists on a maximalist po=ition, Khamenei and other Iranian hardliners will 
likely interpret it as d=finitive proof that Washington's real goal is regime change rather than a =uclear accord. 
Solidifying this perception would likely enhance, rather th=n lessen, Tehran's motivation to seek a nuclear deterrent as 
the only mean= of ensuring regime survival. 
A permanent end to Iranian enrichment is not in the cards. Instead of pushi=g for an impossible goal, the United States 
and other world powers should =ush for a possible 
one<http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/07/10/ge=ting_to_yes_with_iran>: an agreement that caps Iranian 
enrichment at the 5=percent level (sufficient for civilian power plants but far away from bomb=grade) under stringent 
conditions designed to preclude Tehran's ability to=rapidly produce nuclear weapons, including restrictions on Iran's 
stockpil= of low enriched uranium, limitations on centrifuges, intrusive inspection=, and halting the construction of a 
plutonium reactor that could open an a=ternative pathway to nuclear weapons. Such an accord would allow Khamenei 
=nd Rouhani to claim Iran's "rights" had been respected, giving them a face=saving way out of the current nuclear crisis. 
Even this might be difficult=for the Iranian regime to stomach. But if paired with meaningful sanctions=relief, it has a 
much better chance of success than insisting on the compl=te dismantling of Iran's program. 
Washington should not accept a bad deal. But if we are to avoid the worst p=ssible outcomes -- unconstrained 
enrichment leading to an eventual Iranian=bomb or another major war in the Middle East -- then a good-if-imperfect 
d=al is preferable to no deal at all.

The Rise and Fall of Israel's Settlement Movement 
Jeffrey Goldberg 
Oct 14, 2013 -- Moments after Hanan Porat and his fellow Israeli paratroope=s had crossed the Suez Canal as spearheads 
of a furious Israeli counteratt=ck in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, he was severely wounded in an Egyptian mort=r 
bombardment. The Egyptians and Syrians had surprised Israel on Yom Kippu=, with an atrocious loss of life, and crushed 
the country's post-Six Day=War belief in its own invincibility. As Porat lay recovering in his hospi=al bed, his chest 
ravaged by shrapnel wounds, he thanked God that he wasn=92t in the burn unit. And then, as Yossi Klein 
Halevi<http://www.harpercol=ins.com/authors/19429/Yossi_Klein_Halevi/index.aspx> writes in his new boo=, "Like 
Dreamers<http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Like-Dreamers-Yossi-=lein-Halevi/?isbn=9780060545765>," the next 
phase of Porat's life mi=sion was revealed. 
He read, in his hospital bed, an article in a kibbutz newspaper by a writer=named Arnon Lapid, titled, "An Invitation to 
Weeping." Porat wasn't a =ember of the secular kibbutz elite; he was a member of a more marginalized=group of 
religious Zionists, who envied the kibbutznikim, and respected th=m as well. He was stunned by what Lapid wrote: "I 
want to send you all =n invitation to weeping ... I will weep over my dead, you will weep over y=urs ... we'll weep ... for 
the illusions that were shattered, for the as=umptions that were proven to be baseless, the truths that were exposed as 
=ies ... And we will pity ourselves, for we are worthy of pity." Halevi =rites that when Porat read this lament he "felt as if 
his wounds were be=ng torn open. He would have shouted if he had the voice. Pity the generati=n privileged to restore
