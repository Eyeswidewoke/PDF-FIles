make every reasonable effort to document offender patterns of behavior and 
attempt to determine the type of offender involved. 
Because their molestation of children is part of a long-term persistent pattern 
of behavior, preferential sex offenders are like human evidence machines. During 
their lifetime they leave behind a string of victims and collection of child pornog-
raphy and erotica. In these cases a wealth of evidence is available to investigators 
and prosecutors. All they need to uncover it is an understanding of how to 
recognize these offenders and how these offenders operate and the full commit-
ment of agency/department time and resources. Comparing the consistency 
between "what" is alleged to have happened and "who" is suspected of doing it is 
an important application of the offender typology. If a victim describes his or her 
. victimization as involving what clearly sound like the behavior patterns of a pref-
erential sex offender, then'the fact that the alleged offender fits that pattern is 
corroborative. If he does not, there is an inconsistency that needs to be resolved. 
The inconsistency could be because the alleged "what" is inaccurate (e.g., dis-
torted account from victim, insufficient details); the suspected "who" has been 
misevaluated (e.g., incomplete background, erroneous assessment); or the alleged 
"who" is innocent (e.g., suspect did not commit alleged crime). 
It is obviously better to convict a child molester based 
on his or her past behavior. If all else fails, however, prefer-
ential child molesters usually can be convicted in the future 
based on their continuing molestation of children. (See the 
chapters titled "Definitions" [beginning on page 9] through 
"Use of Computers by Sex Offenders" [ending on page 99] 
for a complete discussion of these patterns.) 
Identify Adult Witnesses and Suspects 
Not all sexual victimization of children is "one-on-one." There are cases with 
multiple offenders and accomplices. One benefit of a multioffender case is that it 
increases the likelihood that there is a weak link in the group. Do not assume that 
accomplices will not cooperate with the investigation. The conspiracy model of 
building a case against one suspect and then using that suspect's testimony against 
others can be useful. Because of the need to protect potential child victims, 
however, the conspiracy model of investigation has limitations in child-sexual-
victimization cases. Investigators and prosecutors cannot knowingly allow children 
to be molested as the case is built by "turning" suspects. Corroboration of a child 
victim's statement with adult-witness testimony, however, is an important and 
valuable technique. 
Because their molestation 
of children is part of a long-
term persistent pattern of 
behavior, preferential sex 
offenders are like human 
evidence machines. 
Medical Evidence 
Whenever possible all children suspected of having been sexually victimized should 
be afforded a medical examination by a trained and competent physician (Jenny, 
2002). The primary purpose of this examination is to assess potential injury, assess 
the need for treatment, and reassure the patient. A secondary purpose is to deter-
mine the presence of any corroborating evidence of acute or chronic trauma. The 
Ability and willingness of medical doctors to corroborate child sexual victimiza-
tion has improved greatly in recent years, primarily due to better training and the 
use of protocols, rape kits, the colposcope, toluidine blue dye, ultraviolet-light 
photography, and other such techniques.
