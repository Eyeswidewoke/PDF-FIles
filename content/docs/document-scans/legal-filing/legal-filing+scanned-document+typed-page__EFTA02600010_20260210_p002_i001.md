disaster. What impress=d me the most is that disaster risk reduction has been a very low priority=br>over the 
past two decades. In this period, the international community =ommitted just over $3trillion in aid. 
For the past two decades, the i=ternational community spent 106,7 billion US 
dollars on disaster-rela=ed assistance, but of that106,7 billion, only 13,5 billion was invested in=br>prevention 
and preparedness. Of overall aid financing over 20 years, th= $13.5 billion spent on 
DRR accounts for just 0.4% of the total amount =pent on international aid. Essentially, for every 
$100 spent on develop=ent aid, just 40 cents have been invested in defending from the 
i=pact of disasters. I believe that we have to change those numbers. We have=to move from the 
tradition of response, to a culture of preventio=. This is something that we need to pay attention to 
because "= penny saved is a penny earned. "I consider Northeastern universit= bachelors degree 
completion the most valuable program I could=use inorder to fulfill my passion for gaining 
knowledge in manag=ment science. I view a two-year term as not only an efficient use of time<=r>but also as 
the only opportunity to fully emerse into the school4k=99s activities while focusing 
primarily on the following three key area= of my professional and personal interests. 
1. Acquire world-class mana=erial skills. I aim to accelerate my growth as a leader not only to 
be = more effective and strategic management but also to prepare for the chall=nges ahead. In the 
current world where everything is changing so quickl=, real-time experience in the field is 
sometimes even more important th=n theoretical knowledge. I see the education provided by 
Northeastern U=iversity ,by immersing students in real-world experiential opportunities t=rough 
co-op programs necessary and the most effective to adapt to curre=t management challenges. 
2. Gain functional knowledge I am passionate a=out finding market opportunities and building 
effective solutions. For =his reason, I am excited about learning from Northeastern professor 
Fra=cesca Grippa, who is also interested in promoting innovation and team effe=tiveness. I 
believe that reconsidering global management of will help t= mitigate the impact of natural 
hazards. 
3. Build an influe=tial network. 
I am confident that in the diverse and ambitious =EU 
environment, I can expand my network which I can later draw =pon to solve a myriad of business 
and social problems. Most importantly= however, I will have an unparalleled opportunity to meet 
a variety of =nteresting people, develop friendships, and build successful business part=erships. 
I see my general purpose in life as being useful to the societ= and making people's lives better. 
Creating and seeing the resu=t of work brings the meaning to my life. In the twenty-first century, 
p=ople have to overcome a lot of challenges and my goals are to apply my ene=gy and skills in 
the fields of risk management. I feel that with manage=ent degree I could be much more helpful 
for the society than being a me=eorologist. My dream is one day to become a part of The Global 
Bank Gro=p and I think that compelting an education at Northeastern Universit= along with co-op 
internship programs will help me reach this goal.
