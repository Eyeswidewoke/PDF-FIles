FX Blueprint: Dashing Buck 
Theme I/10. Turning Up the Volume 
• 
Trading volumes, one of the better proxy indicators 
for realized volatility, have been grinding higher 
• 
Increased monetary divergence and 
abundant 
global liquidity could see this trend continue further, 
we like long volatility option plays 
Spot (Jading volumes picking up 
Trading volumes and volatility tend to closely track 
each other and volumes are now on the march. Last 
month's average Daily Volume (ADV) traded on the 
EBS platform for spot transactions averaged $128.3b1n 
a day, or 7% higher than the previous month. Looking 
at the disaggregated YtD trends, it can be seen that 
trading activity has been somewhat suppressed in the 
euro by the Cypriot banking crisis and broader Euro 
zone growth uncertainty, though was held up by the 
yen reflation trade and commodity currencies in C/1 
(charts 2-4, relative trading volumes for other 
currencies are available on request). 
Options !waken; :Plano a sandal mow 
The options market had signaled a similar pickup in 
2013. ADVs for exchange traded options from the CME 
for April increased by 61% YoY. Excluding yen options, 
which accounted for two-third of the differences in 
contracts traded, the largest relative difference was in 
GBP, more than doubling (143% YoY) since last April 
despite the lowered spot transactions, followed by 
AUD (79% YoY) and CAD (16% YoY). Although these 
contracts represent a small sample of the derivatives 
market and are corporate biased, we find that these 
often correlate well to volatilities (chart 5). When taken 
together with spot data the broader picture emerges -
higher overall volumes from the historical lows of 2012, 
followed by realized volatility. 
Monetary divergence should help 
In terms of whether the volume uptrend could be 
sustained in 2013, it appears that this trend is 
increasingly finding support from monetary divergence 
(one of the core drivers of FX volatility, in addition to 
volume) in an abundant global liquidity environment. A 
number of factors could contribute to this: Abenomics-
related investor outflows from Japan have yet to 
materialize, although recent net outflows in Toshin 
investment is suggestive of the initial pickup. RBA's 
monetary stance remains closely tethered to global 
growth, while the rest of the dollar bloc and 
Scandinavia central bank policies are linked to 
domestic pressures. Elsewhere in the UK, stagflation 
remains a prominent issue, further, it is worth nothing 
that almost any policy response could conceivably 
push volumes higher given that GBP/USD spot volumes 
experienced one of the sharpest falls VU) within the
