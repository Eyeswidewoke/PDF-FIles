FX Blueprint: Forever Young 
Gulf pegs made economic sense it you can keep them 
There are lessons from sturdier pegs as well, notably 
Hong Kong and Denmark. 
In cases where the 
economic rationale for keeping a peg outweighs the 
loss of independent monetary policy the central bank 
will go to great lengths to defend it. Saudi Arabia 
endured several periods of deflation in the 80s and 90s 
because they have little to gain from devaluation. Chief 
Saudi 
economist 
Melhem 
Melhem 
notes 
that 
devaluation will not restore competitiveness as oil 
dominates exports and imports of labor and materials 
would suffer immediate pass-through inflation. 
Further fiscal consolidation is the key for longer-term 
peg stability. 
The Saudi government is intensely 
focused on this issue, having just announced a 50-66% 
increase in fuel prices. More radical reforms could 
include introducing income taxes, reducing subsides on 
education, health care and housing, or further reducing 
subsidies on electricity and water (The Economist, "The 
Saudi Blueprint", 9-Jan 2016). 
But FX forwards 
markets were underwhelmed by last month's budget 
proposals. DB strategist Aleksander Stojanovski notes 
that while the announced budget of 5224bn would 
result in a S87bn shortfall (13% of GDP) off projected 
revenues of $137bn, actual spending typically exceeds 
budgeted spending by 25%; the latter would produce a 
21% of GDP budget deficit (see MENA Strategy, 29-
Dec-15). The authorities appear more committed to 
meeting the budget this year with military overruns the 
key risk as regional conflicts (ISIS, Yemen) intensify.

Our recommendation is to watch the 12m USDSAR 
forward for better entry levels to buy. The spring 2015 
Brent rally was one such opportunity; 12m SAR 
forward points fell from 200 to a low of 15 in May. 
Meantime other Gulf dollar pegs are under more 
pressure (Kuwait pegs against a basket): 
1. Oman: The IMF projects a staggering 15%+ 
Omani C/A deficit through 2020 even as the 
Saudi and Qatari C/A return to balance in 
2018; unsurprisingly OMR forward points have 
spiked (Figures 4-5). 
2. Bahrain: 
DB strategist Oliver Massetti notes 
the Bahrain oil budget breakeven price 
exceeds S120 and reserves are quite low 
(Figure 6). 
Surprisingly, 12m BHD forward 
points are indicatively trading below SAR. 
While the May 2015 USDSAR entry point may appear 
obvious in hindsight, and unlikely to repeat, markets 
have time and again proven to have short memories. If 
we see sub-400 levels in 12m USDSAR forward points 
again it will be time to buy but for now the trade is too 
expensive to enter.
