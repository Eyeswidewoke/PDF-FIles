considers such net asset valuation or other valuation information does not accurately reflect the 
Company's or the Compartment's interests in such fund, whether because such information has 
been generated after a delay from the fund's own valuation point, change in markets or 
otherwise. The NAV is final and binding notwithstanding that it may have been based on 
unofficial or estimated net asset values: 
(ii) 
the interests of Investments registered in the name of the relevant Compartment or in the name 
of an Intermediary Vehicle which are listed on a stock exchange or dealt in another regulated 
market will be valued on the basis of the last available published stock exchange or market 
value: 
(iii) 
the value of any cash on hand or on deposit, bills and demand notes and accounts, receivable, 
prepaid expenses, cash dividends and interest declared or accrued as aforesaid, and not yet 
received shall be deemed to be the full amount thereof, unless it is unlikely to be received in 
which case the value thereof shall be arrived at after making such discount as the General 
Partner may consider appropriate in such case to reflect the true value thereof; 
(iv) 
any transferable security and any money market instrument negotiated or listed on a stock 
exchange or any other organised market will be valued on the basis of the last known price, 
unless this price is not representative, in which case the value of such an asset will be 
determined on the basis of its fair value estimated by the General Partner with good faith; 
(v) 
unlisted securities or securities not traded on a stock exchange or any other regulated market 
as well as listed securities, or securities whose quoted price is, in the opinion of the General 
Partner, not representative of actual market value, will be valued at their last known price or, 
in the absence of such price, on the basis of their probable realisation value, as determined 
with prudence and in good faith by the General Partner, provided that investments in private 
equity securities not listed or dealt in on any stock exchange or on any other regulated market 
will be estimated with due care and in good faith, taking due account of the guidelines and 
principles for valuation of portfolio companies set out by International Private Equity and 
Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines, published by the European Venture Capital 
Association (EVCA), the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) and the French 
Venture Capital Association (AFIC) in March 2005, as may be amended from time to time; 
(vi) 
Investments registered in the name of the relevant Compartment or in the name of an 
Intermediary Vehicle, other than mentioned in Sections 12.2(eXi) to 12.2(eXiv) will be valued 
as more fully described in Section 13 of the General Section, provided that the General Partner 
may deviate from such valuation if deemed in the interest of the Company and its 
Shareholders. 
(0 
The General Partner, in its discretion, may permit some other method of valuation to be used if it 
considers that such valuation better reflects the fair value of any asset or liability of the Company in 
compliance with Luxembourg Law. This method will then be applied in a consistent way. The 
Administrator can rely on such deviations as approved by the Company for the purpose of the NAV 
calculation. 
(g) 
All assets denominated in a currency other than the Reference Currency of the respective Class shall be 
converted at the mid-market conversion rate between the reference currency and the currency of 
denomination as at the Valuation Date. 
12.3 
For the avoidance of doubt, these provisions are rules for determining the NAV per Share and are not intended to 
affect the treatment for accounting or legal purposes of the assets and liabilities of the Company or any Shares 
issued by the Company.
