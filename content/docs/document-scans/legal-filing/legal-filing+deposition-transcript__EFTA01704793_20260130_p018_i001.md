Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges:We use the Average Daily 
Balance methodto calculate Finance Charges on your Account. Under this method, we figure the Finance Charges on your 
Account by applying the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for each feature (suth as 
Purchase., Cash Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (including current transactions). To get the 
Average toady Balance for each feature, we 
take the beginning balance for the feature each day (inclutfing unpaid 
ce
Finan 
Charges from previous billing periods), (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees (3) subtract any payments or 
credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments.For each day ear the first day of the billing period, we also 
add an amount of Interest equal to the previous days daily balance multiplied by the daily periodic rate 
for the feature. Thisgives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for 
the next day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the 
feature for the biting penod and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average 
Daily Balance for the feature. For all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance 
will be considered to be zero if you paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the 
Payment Due Dale shown on that statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number 
of days in the billing period and the daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the Finance Charge 
assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge. for the tilling period 
is calculated by adding the Finance Charges assessed on all features of the Account. This method of calculating the 
Average Daily Balance and Finance Charge results In daily compounding of Finance Charges. The minimum 
Finance Charge fcr any billing period in which Finance Charges are imposed is $0.50. 
Transactions Made In Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a foreign currency, k will be 
converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or ow agents. UnleSs a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date. 
Currently, the conversion rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest 
official conversion rate published by a government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate 
identified by us from customary banking sources, on the conversion dale or the prior business day, 
in each 
instance increased 
by 
2%. This conversion rate may differ from rates in effect on the 
date of your Charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such 
establishments use.
