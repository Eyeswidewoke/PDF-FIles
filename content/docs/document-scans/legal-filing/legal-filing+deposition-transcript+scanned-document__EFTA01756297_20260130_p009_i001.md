will not return to a state of submission. They have tasted =hat it is to bring change through protest. As in Iran, where the 
deep refo=mist current was crushed in 2009 only to resurface in 2013, these currents=run deep and will reemerge. 
Here in Turkey, the closest approximation to a liberal order in a Middle Ea=tern Muslim state exists. That is the region's 
core challenge: finding a=model that reconciles Islam and modernity, religion with nonsectarian stat=hood. So it is worth 
recalling that Turkey's democracy is the fruit of 9= years of violent back-and-forth since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk founded 
the R=public in 1923, and imposed a Western culture. 
Only over the past decade, with the arrival in power of Recep Tayyip Erdoga=, has the idea taken hold that Islam is 
compatible with a liberal order. F=r many secular Turks the swing of the pendulum has been excessive. The pro=ests at 
Gezi Park this summer were about Erdogan's invasion in the name =f Islam of Turks' personal lives. This was democratic 
pushback from Turk=y's secular coast against the conservative Anatolian heartland. 
If in Turkey it has taken 90 years for a democracy to evolve that is not an=i-Islamic, then the 30 months since the Arab 
Spring are a mere speck in ti=e. Moreover, as Mustafa Akyol points out in his book "Islam Without Extr=mes," Turkey, 
unlike most other Muslim countries, was never colonized, w=th the result that political Islam did not take on a virulent 
anti-Western=character. It was not a violent reaction against being the West's lackey= as in Iran. 
Now Iran, under its new president, Hassan Rouhani, is trying again to build=moderation into its theocracy and repair 
relations with the West. Such att=mpts have failed in the past. But the Middle Eastern future will look very=different if 
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran — symbol of the violent entry in=o the American consciousness of the Islamic radical —
reopens and the Is=amic Republic becomes a freer polity. 
Nothing inherent to Islam makes it anti-Western. History has. The Islamic r=volution was an assertion of ideological 
independence from the West. As po=er in the world shifts away from the West, this idea has run its course. I=anians are 
drawn to America. 
The United States can have cordial relations with Iran just as it does with=China, while disagreeing with it on most 
things. A breakthrough would demo=strate that the vicious circles of the Middle East can be broken. 
I believe the U.S. Embassy in Tehran will reopen within five years because =he current impasse has become senseless. 
With Iran inside the tent rather =han outside, anything would be possible, even an Israeli-Palestinian peace= 
If Arabs could see in Israel not a Zionist oppressor but the region's mos= successful economy, a modern state built in 65 
years, they would pose the=selves the right questions about openness, innovation and progress. Israel= in turn, by 
getting out of the business of occupation and oppression, cou=d ensure its future as a Jewish and democratic state. 
There is another future for the Middle East, one glimpsed during the Arab S=ring, but first it must be dragged from the 
insistent clutches of the past=

The Arab Sunset: The Coming Collapse of the Gulf Monarchies 
Christopher Davidson 
October 10, 2013 -- Since their modern formation in the mid-twentieth centu=y, Saudi Arabia and the five smaller Gulf 
monarchies -- Bahrain, Kuwait, O=an, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) -- have been governed by hig=ly 
autocratic and seemingly anachronistic regimes. Nevertheless, their rul=rs have demonstrated remarkable resilience in 
the face of bloody conflicts=on their doorsteps, fast-growing populations at home, and modernizing forc=s from abroad. 
One of the monarchies' most visible survival strategies has been to stren=then security ties with Western powers, in part 
by allowing the United Sta=es, France, and Britain to build massive bases on their soil and by spendi=g lavishly on 
Western arms. In turn, this expensive militarization has aid=d a new generation of rulers that appears more prone than 
ever to antagoni=ing Iran and even other Gulf states. In some cases, grievances among them =ave grown strong enough 
to cause diplomatic crises, incite violence, or pr=mpt one monarchy to interfere in the domestic politics of another. 
It would thus be a mistake to think that the Gulf monarchies are somehow in=incible. Notwithstanding existing internal 
threats, these regimes are also=facing mounting external ones -- from Western governments, from Iran, and =ach other. 
And these are only exacerbating their longstanding conflicts an= inherent contradictions.
