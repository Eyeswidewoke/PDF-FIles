Deutsche Bank 
Risks 
■ Glencore - GLEN.L: Variance in commodity prices or operating currencies 
from expectations are key risks to our earnings and valuation forecasts. On 
the downside, weaker commodity prices would have a significant negative 
sentiment impact and provide a deterrent to a re-rating. Glencore's key 
growth assets are in less politically stable regions than most - such as the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Equatorial Guinea - which 
introduces a higher degree of sovereign risk. Risks for zinc include 
increasing marginal production. 
■ Infineon Technologies - IFXGn.DE: Key downside risks include: FX (every 
1c change in EUR /$ impacts revenues by -0.5% and earnings by -1%); 
Cyclicality and inventory de-stocking; Large dependence on Automotive; 
Potentially value destructive M&A 
■ Informa PLC - INF.L: Downside risks include potential earnings dilution 
from the sale or closure of non-core businesses. The business may require 
additional investment on top of the announced plan. Informa intends to 
expand via acquisition in the events industry, where there is competition for 
assets and where growth is cyclical. The Academic division has high 
exposure to print books, including textbooks, which could suffer from 
structural declines. 
■ Kingspan - KSP.I: Slower global growth, especially in large markets for 
Kingspan such as the UK; Slower innovation or penetration growth; Euro 
strength causing negative translation effect; Poor cost inflation pass-
through; Inability to complete targeted M&A in the Light & Air division. 
■ KPN - KPN.AS: Key downside risks include an (i) aggressive push from 
Tele2 as the new network operator in the market; (ii) continued weakness in 
Business due to the economy and IP migration and (ii) restructuring costs 
which could weigh on the FCF generation of KPN. 
• Linde - LING.DE: Risks include weaker global GDP, lower retention of the cost 
cutting/efficiencies from Praxair merger, FX, Praxair merger falling apart and 
aggressive competition from peers for new on-site contracts. 
■ Prudential - PRU.L: The group's balance sheet is negatively exposed to higher 
US and UK corporate bond spreads, lower US and UK bond yields and weaker 
US equity markets. Earnings growth could be further impacted by any 
strengthening in Sterling given that 86% of earnings are non-GBP, or a weaker 
than expected outlook for Asian economies. Other downside risks include 
worse than anticipated political or regulatory changes either to solvency 
requirements or market practices in its principal territories. For the former, we 
note especially developing GSII capital rules, guarantee risks in its US life back 
book and proposed NAIC changes to the US capital regime. On the latter, we 
highlight the possibility of further regulatory restrictions on mainland China sales 
into HK or a failure by the new US administration to modify the previously 
planned DOL changes. 
■ Royal Mail - RMG.L: Upside risks include faster execution of the 
transformation plan, better pricing in UK parcels, higher parcel volumes than 
forecast, no industrial action and a successful sale of its surplus properties 
■ Renault SA - RENA.PA: Downside risks include: i) failure of the new product 
campaign in Europe, which could result in market share loss and in pricing 
pressure; ii) a tougher European market environment, likely leading to further 
pricing and volume erosion where, usually on the downside, OP leverage could 
be as high as -50%; and iii) worse-than-expected emerging market 
performance.
