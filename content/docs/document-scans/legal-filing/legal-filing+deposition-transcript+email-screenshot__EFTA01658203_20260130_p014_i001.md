The New York Times (7/21, Landler, Castle, 18.61M) says the report, which is "in many 
ways harder on British officials than the Russians, did not answer the question of whether 
Russia swayed one of the most consequential votes in modern British history: the 2016 
referendum on leaving the EU. But it was unforgiving about who is protecting British 
democracy." The authors said, "No one is." 
The AP (7/21) reports Stewart Hosie, a committee member and member of Parliament for 
the opposition Scottish National Party, "accused the government of `actively avoiding' 
allegations of Russian meddling, which he said was unforgivable after evidence emerged that 
Moscow had interfered with the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 and the US 
presidential election two years later." 
CNN (7/21, Dewan, McGee, Greene, 83.16M) reports that, "in one key section of the 
report, dealing with the Brexit referendum, the British government is accused of failing to 
conduct a thorough inquiry into allegations of a Kremlin-sponsored influence campaign." The 
report says, "We have not been provided with any post-referendum assessment of Russian 
attempts at interference." 
The Telegraph (UK) (7/21, Hope, Rayner, 956K) reports the committee's 55-page 
published report, titled simply `Russia,' "was heavily redacted." A separate annex "was not 
withheld because it contains classified information." TIME (7/21, 18.47M) reports the 
intelligence committee report "covered the full range of the Russian threat to the UK, including 
election interference, espionage and targeted assassinations such as the attempt to kill former 
spy Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury two years ago." Reuters (7/21) reports that 
the report "said Russia sought to meddle in the 2014 Scottish referendum and intelligence 
agencies should produce an assessment of potential interference in the Brexit referendum." 
The Independent (VS) (7/21, Sengupta, 1.36M) reports the security and intelligence 
services "were particularly wary of being accused of interfering in the political process." As a 
result, "the task of `defending the UK's democratic processes,' a fundamental safeguard for the 
nation, became `something of a hot potato:' Russian influence was established as the `new 
normal' for the UK." The ISC "stressed that urgent measures now have to be taken, with MI5 
taking the lead in combating the threat." 
NBC News (7/21, Smith, 6.14M) reports Lisa Nandy, the opposition Labour Party's shadow 
foreign secretary "said it was `extraordinary' that Boris Johnson chose to block the publication 
of this important report that systematically goes through the threat Russia poses to the UK's 
national security." 
Also providing similar coverage on the story are NPR (7/21, Dwyer, 3.12M), The Hill (7/21, 
Bowden, 2.98M), Independent (UK) (7/21, Merrick, 1.36M), and The Guardian LUK) (7/21, 
Murphy, 4.19M). 
Op-Ed: Responding Effectively Is Key Point Of The UK Parliament's Report. In 
his column in the Washington Examiner (7/21, 448K), Tom Rogan writes, "There are 
opportunities even where the committee only sees difficulties. On Syria, for example, the report 
notes that `Russia views its intervention in support of the Assad regime as a success, and it is 
clear that its presence in Syria presents the West with difficulty in supporting peace in the 
region. Russia's increased links with Iran, and trade initiatives with a range of countries in the 
Gulf area, complicate the situation further." He contends, "While this is all true, the UK could 
offset Russian influence-building with the Sunni monarchies by consolidating US support for 
these admittedly imperfect alliances. Britain could also introduce legislation to increase Russian 
President Vladimir Putin's now-escalating difficulties in his Syrian adventure. Such efforts would 
have significant humanitarian and strategic import. As a parliamentary report, however, the 
first priority here is to generate and maintain public attention upon Putin's threat and 
associated legislation."
