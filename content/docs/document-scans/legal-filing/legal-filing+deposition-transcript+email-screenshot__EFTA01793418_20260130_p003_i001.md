collecting data from a robotic body and camera in a =hysical world), and the integration of that structure with an 
=rchitecture that is capable of thought, language, intention, goal =irected action, decision making, and so on. The former 
is tricky, the =atter impossible. Complexity itself does not define intentional action, =nd the differences between 
individuals and species should not be =educed to differences in complexity perceived by the respective agents. a I 
agree that we need to gain a much better understanding of "complex 2 =omplex" cognition, but that must integrate, not 
replace what we already =now about the organization of cognitive processes. I am certain that =ur current models are a 
long way off from capturing the richness of =onscious experience of our inner processes, and even more so from the 
=uch greater complexity of those processes that cannot be experienced. 
> Another interesting point I gathered from Takashi's talk is the idea =f something we might call "hyper-complex" 
cognition. The complexity =andled by our human minds (as well as the one of Andrew Ng's deep =earning Youtube 
watching networks) builds on very simple stimuli. But =hat if the atoms themselves are abstract or highly complex, for 
=nstance because they are already semantic internet content? The =ognitive agents handling those elements may 
essentially be operating at = level above human cognition if they are capable of operating on that =omplexity without 
reducing it. Unlike humans which are forced to =ranslate and reduce all content into their individual frame of =eference, 
and access it only through a single perspective at a time, =rtificial agents do not need to obey such restrictions. Today's 
Big =ata moniker probably marks just the beginnings of the abilities of =achines to make sense of abstract and complex 
input data.

from complexity rather =han abstraction (which is generally antithetical to academic learning). =It would seem to me 
that most artificial intelligence research has =tarted from abstraction (and forgive my ignorance if I'm off base here) =nd 
attempted to build up to complexity. My very cursory look at the =oscha's MicroPSl work seems to show an approach 
moving in the direction =f the what Ikegami did with the MTM from the classical =bstraction-first approach. MicroPSl 
places its constructs in a reduced =idelity virtual environment, has lower-level abstractions, and brain 
=tructures/dynamic pre-synthesized for things like motivation, emotion, =please correct me if I'm off base - like I said: 
cursory). The brain =tructures in living systems have have evolved as low-energy means of =rocessing brain signals (both 
sensory data flows and internally routed =treams) once they have showed fitness - ultimately, they were =and-blasted 
into their shape by generations of massive data flows. We =ave an understanding of what purpose they serve but not a 
good =nderstanding of how they work (maybe I'm behind on the state of the art =n neuroscience on that point?).

»» Ikegami is starting from the complexity and seeing what emerges - =hich seems to me to mirror the rise of 
consciousness in natural =ystems. Mind is the surfer that hangs on the eternal wave of the =assive data flow of sensory 
input without wiping out. Somehow, the =eality of the temporally continuous observer arose from exposure to =ensory 
data flows and the evolution of the complexity of the brain. =kegami is shortcutting the snail's pace of the physical 
evolution of =atural systems by synthesizing a neural network of sufficient =omplexity as well as high-resolution sensors.

to imagine some =nteresting possibilities in a) whimsically, the spontaneous emergence =f consciousness and b)
