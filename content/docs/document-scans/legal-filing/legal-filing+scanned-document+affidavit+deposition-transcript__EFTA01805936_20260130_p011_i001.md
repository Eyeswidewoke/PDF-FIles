September 27, 2013 -- Recent estimates place the total number of Syrian refugees in Jordan at over 500,000. Zaatari 
refugee camp has become the fourth largest city in Jordan by population. It may not be much of a home, but each 
refugee costs the Jordanian government the equivalent of $3,750 to host per year. The cost of Syrian refugees is putting 
a tremendous strain on the economy and is affecting the patronage systems that have ensured tribal loyalty to Jordan's 
monarchy in the past. In addition to increasing resentment within the tribal population, the presence of Syrian refugees 
has also provided a boost in support for the Muslim Brotherhood, Jordan's best-organized opposition, thereby adding to 
the tension the Hashemite kingdom faces. 
Jordan's ability to absorb Syrian refugees has become a growing issue. Its fiscal position has deteriorated since the 
beginning of the Arab Spring; hosting 500,000 refugees has already cost Jordan over $800 million since the Syrian war 
began, and unrest across the Arab world, particularly in neighboring Syria, has cost Jordan's economy as much as $4 
billion. Furthermore, foreign assistance, on which Jordan was able to rely while dealing with the influx of Iraqi refugees, 
is insufficient. Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour recently stated in an interview that "the foreign assistance extended to 
Jordan is not enough in the face of the extraordinary numbers of Syrian refugees who have sought a safe haven in the 
kingdom since the start of the Syrian conflict in March 2011." 
Government and United Nations officials say the refugee influx has placed a huge burden on already overstretched 
water and power supplies, as well as housing and education, which has rendered subsidy cuts necessary. The 
government has raised the prices of fuel and commercial electricity — and bread and water are expected to follow soon. 
Jordanians, reeling from these price increases, are also angry about the impact of the refugees on unemployment. 
According to the Ministry of Labor, approximately 160,000 Syrians work illegally in Jordan. They accept lower pay and 
tougher work conditions to fill positions in bakeries, garages, and cafes. This increases resentment among Jordanians, 
who suffer from an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent. It also feeds the attitude that "there is no room in Jordan for 
Jordanians" — the country is also home to 1.8 million Palestinian and 450,000 Iraqi refugees. Unlike their Palestinian and 
Iraqi predecessors, however, the majority of Syrians arrive with limited funds, placing an immediate burden on Jordan's 
social services. 
Bedouin tribes and townships have expressed growing anger at the failure of the government to do more to help the 
areas that have borne the biggest burden from the refugees. Tribes are protesting against the loss of their traditional 
economic privileges from a nation with an enormous fiscal deficit. Should the economic strain brought on by the Syrian 
refugees continue, significant divisions are likely to develop between the monarchy and its institutions in the future: 
Tribal benefactors are the backbone of support for the monarchy, and their traditional economic privileges will likely 
continue to be reduced to meet the demands of the fiscal deficit. 
This would give renewed impetus to street demonstrations and could fuel protests by public sector workers and army 
veterans at a time when the palace has done little to meet popular demands on corruption and economic restructuring. 
Moreover, it is possible that as Syrian refugees become increasingly desperate and politicized, these economic problems 
could mutate into political tension. 
In response, the government has reportedly denied entry to Syrians of Palestinian origin, fearing it may upset Jordan's 
delicate political balance, although the government denies this. Memories of the 1970 Black September civil war 
between the Jordanian government and militias made up of Palestinian refugees make authorities wary of any political 
activity among the Syrian refugees. 
Furthermore, Syrian refugees are finding resonance and appeal within Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood and its political 
wing, the Islamic Action Front. The Syrian refugee population is used to bolster local perceptions of the movement's
