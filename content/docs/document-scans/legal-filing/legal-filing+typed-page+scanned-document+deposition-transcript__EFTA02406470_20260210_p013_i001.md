the fr=ctious country. In contrast to Libya's unusable chemical stockpile, analys=s emphasize that Syrian chemical agents 
are weaponized and deliverable. In=urgents and terrorists with past or present connections to the military might feasibly 
be able to effectively =inseminate chemical agents over large populations. (The Global Security Newswire 
<http://www.nti.oregsn/article/us-watching-syrian-chemica=-arms-amid-fear-attack-diversionk recently asserted that 
"[tJhe Assad regime is thought to possess between 100 and 200 Scud missiles carrying wa=heads loaded with sarin nerve 
agent. The government is also believed to ha=e several hundred tons of sarin agent and mustard gas stockpiled that 
coul= be used in air-dropped bombs and artillery shells, according to information compiled by the James Martin 
Ce=ter.") 
Given its robust ch=mical weapons arsenal and its perceived need to deter Israel, Syria has lo=g been suspected of 
having an active biological weapons program. Despite s=gning the Biological Weapons and Toxins Convention in 1972 
(the treaty prohibits the development, production, and =tockpiling of biological and toxin weapons), Syria never ratified 
the=treaty. Some experts contend that any Syrian biological weapons program ha= not moved beyond the research and 
development phase. Still, Syria's biotechnical infrastructure undoubtedly has the capability 
<http://www.dni.gov/reports/2011_report_to_congress_wmd.pdf> to develop numerous biological weapon agents. 
After Israel destroyed a clandestine Sy=ian nuclear reactor in September 2007, Damascus may have accelerated its 
c=emical and biological weapons programs. 
It's hard to guard =MD when a government collapses. Although the United States and its allies =re reportedly monitoring 
Syria's chemical weapons, recent history warns th=t securing them from theft or transfer is an extraordinary challenge. 
For example, during Operation Iraqi Freedom= more than 330 metric tons of military-grade high explosives vanished 
from=Iraq's Al-Qaqaa military installation. Almost 200 tons of the most powerfu= of Iraq's high-explosives, HMX -- used 
by some states to detonate nuclear weapons -- was under Internatio=al Atomic Energy Agency seal. Many tons of Al-
Qaqaa's sealed HMX reported'= went missing in the early days of the war in Iraq. Forensic tests later r=vealed that some 
of these military-grade explosives <http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/fate-of-high-e=plosives-at-al-qaqaa-still-
unknown-increasing-indications-th/tinotes> were subsequently employed against US and coalition forces. 
Even with a nationw=de presence of 200,000 coalition troops, several other sensitive military =ites were also looted, 
including Iraq's main nuclear complex, Tuwaitha. Sh=uld centralized authority crumble in Syria, it seems highly unlikely 
that the country's 50 chemical storage and=manufacturing facilities -- and, possibly, biological weapon repositories =-
can be secured. The US Defense Department recently estimated <http://www.nti.rsvpl.com/gsn/article/us-calculates-
big- mi=itary-footpri nt- may-be-needed-guard -syrian-chem ical-arms/?mgh. http%3A%2F=2Fwww. nti.org&amp;mgf=1> 
that it would take more than 75,000 US military personnel to guard Syria's=chemical weapons. This is, of course, if they 
could arrive before any WMD =ere transferred or looted -- a highly unlikely prospect. 
Complicating any ef=orts to secure Syria's WMD, post-Assad, are its porous borders 
<http://tarpley.net/docs/CTCForeignFighter.19.Dec07.pdf> =span style="font-size:18.0pt">. With Syria's government 
distracted by in=ernal revolt and US forces now fully out of Iraq, it is plausible that stolen chemical or biological weapons 
could =ind their way across the Syrian border into Iraq. Similarly, Syrian WMD co=ld be smuggled into southern Turkey, 
Jordan, Lebanon, the West Bank, =srael, and, potentially, the United States and Europe. 
At least six formal=terrorist organizations have long maintained personnel within Syria. Three=of these groups 
<http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/170479.pdf> 
Hamas, Hizbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jiha= -- have 
already attempted to acquire or use chemical or biological agents, or both. Perhaps more troubling, Al Qae=a-affiliated 
fighters from Iraq have streamed into Syria <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0221/As-A=-Qaeda-
moves-fight-to-Syria-violence-in-lraq-drops-sharply> , acting, in part, on orders from Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. 
In the past, Al Qaeda-in=lraq fighters attempted to use chemical weapons, most notably attacks that=sought to release 
large clouds of chlorine gas. The entry of Al Qaeda and ot=er jihadist groups 
<http://thewasat.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/jabhah-al-nusrah=and-jihad-in-syriah into the Sy=ian crisis underscores 
its increasingly sectarian manifestation. Nearly 40 percent of Syria's population consists =f members of minority 
communities. Syria's ruling Alawite regime, a b=anch of Shia Islam, is considered heretical by many of Syria's majori=y
