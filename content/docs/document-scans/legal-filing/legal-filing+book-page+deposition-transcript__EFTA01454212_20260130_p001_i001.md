FEATURE: 
STMENTS • 
and inexpensive blocker of UBTI. 
A PPVA investment account eliminates UBTI 
by changing the character of the underlying IDF 
investment from UBTI to passive income. IRC Sec-
tion 72(u)(1) states that the income earned in an annuity 
owned by a non-natural person won't be tax- deferred, 
but, instead, will be currently taxable as annuity income. 
The PPVA investment account should enable tax-
exempt entities to invest without penalty in investments 
that would otherwise introduce UBTI. 
The IRS has issued several favorable private letter 
rulings to tax-exempt organizations. including endow-
ments and foundations, which have supported a PPVA 
investment account's ability to block UBTI.' 
Current UBTI blocker arrangements should be 
reviewed and compared to a PPVA investment account, 
particularly offshore arrangements that can be complex, 
expensive and potentially subject to greater scrutiny. 
How It Works 
IRC Section 72 states that a PPVA qualifies for tax treat-
ment as an annuity ill 
1. 
It's administered by an insurance company and 
allows for the systematic distribution of principal 
over a period of payments' and 
2. 
Its investment offerings arc structured as IDFs that 
arc available only to qualified insurance companies.' 
PPVA investment account values arc treated as sepa-
rate account assets and, therefore, aren't subject to the 
claims of an insurance company's creditor. 
The reallocation of PPVA account assets from one 
IDF to another shouldn't be a taxable event, and the 
PPVA account can be transferred tax-free under IRC 
Section 1035 from one insurance company's administra-
tion platform to anther's. Because there arc generally 
no upfront fees relating to PPVA investment accounts, 
this transfer is a frictionless transaction. 
Withdrawals from a PPVA account are taxed on a 
last-in, first-out basis (with the taxable gain recognized 
until all that remains is the cost basis), and there's a 
10 percent excise tax on gains for withdrawals taken 
before the owner's age 59%.*

Structuring Customized Account 
The process of creating a new IDF with an investment 
manager and an investment mandate that a client finds 
attractive has become dramatically less expensive. 
As the time and cost to create a safe-harbor IDF has 
declined, more and more top-tier investment manage-
ment firms have created. or are in the process of creat-
ing. 1DFs to enable the most tax-inefficient segments of 
their investment portfolios (alternative asset class invest-
ments, such as hedge funds, high-yield bond funds, 
direct lending credit vehicles and high turnover port-
folios) to be managed on a tax-deferred basis through a 
PPVA investment account 
In addition, many leading investment managers man-
age more traditional multi-asset class portfolios in cus-
tomized IDFs. In many cases. a customized IDF can be 
created and attached to an insurance company segregat-
ed asset account platform cost effectively with as little as 
S25 million. 
There arc two basic rules that must be followed for 
an IDF to achieve deferral from current period taxation: 
1. Diversification. The IDF must be proper-
ly diversified. The diversification requirement is 
defined in IRC Section 817(h) as: no more than 
55 percent of the IDF assets may be allocated to 
one underlying fund or security; no more than 
70 percent of the IDF assets may be allocated to 
any two underlying funds or securities; no more 
than 80 percent of the IDF assets may be allocated 
to any three underlying funds or securities; and 
no more than 90 percent of the IDF assets may be 
allocated to any four underlying funds or securi-
ties. A violation of the diversification requirement 
can result in the PPVA investment account being 
subject to current period taxation on all embedded 
gains in the contract and cause the loss of tax deferral
