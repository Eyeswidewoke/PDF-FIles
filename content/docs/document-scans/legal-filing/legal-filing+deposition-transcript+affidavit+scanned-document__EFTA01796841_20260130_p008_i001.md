This race is about =93who can enable and inspire more of its youth to help build broad societa= prosperity," argues Dov 
Seidman, the author of "How" and C.E.O. of =RN, which has an operating center in India. "And that's all about leaders, 
parents and teachers creating environme=ts where young people can be on a quest, not just for a job, but for a car=er —
for a better life that doesn't just surpass but far surpasses the=r parents." Countries that fail to do that will have a youth 
bulge that is not only unemployed, but unemployable, he =rgued. 'They will be disconnected in a connected world, 
despairing as th=y watch others build and realize their potential and curiosity." 
If your country has=either a strong government or a strong civil society, it has the ability t= rise to this challenge. If it has 
neither, it will have real problems, wh=ch is why Egypt is struggling. China leads in providing its youth bulge with 
education, infrastructure and jobs= but lags in unleashing freedom and curiosity. India is the most intriguin= case — if it 
can get its governance and corruption under control. The q=est for upward mobility here, especially among women and 
girls, is palpable. I took part in the graduation ceremony=for The Energy and Resources Institute last week. Of 12 awards 
for the top=students, 11 went to women. 
"India today has =60 million young people under the age of 25 and 225 million between the ag=s of 10 and 19," 
explained Shashi Tharoor, India's minister of state f=r human resource development. "So for the next 40 years we 
should have a youthful working-age population" at a tim= when China and the broad industrialized world is aging. 
According to Thar=or, the average age in China today is around 38, whereas in India it's a=ound 28. In 20 years, that gap 
will be much larger. So this could be a huge demographic dividend — "provid=d that we can educate our youth —
offering vocational training to some a=d university to others to equip them to take advantage of what the 21st-ce=tury 
global economy offers," said Tharoor. "If we get it right, India becomes the workhorse of the world. If we get=it wrong, 
there is nothing worse than unemployable, frustrated" youth. 
Indeed, some of Ind=a's disaffected youth are turning to Maoism in rural areas. "We have M=oists among our tribal 
populations, who have not benefited from the opport=nities of modern India," Tharoor said. There have been violent 
Maoist incidents in 165 of India's 625 districts=in recent years, as Maoists tap into all those left out of the "Indian 
d=eam." So there is now a huge push here to lure poor kids into school. In=ia runs the world's biggest midday lunch 
program, serving 250 million free school lunches each day. It's also dou=led its number of Indian Institutes of 
Technology, from eight to 16, and i= planning 14 new universities for innovation and research. 
But this will all b= for naught without better governance, argues Gurcharan Das, the former C.=.O. of Procter & Gamble 
India, whose latest book is "India Grows at =ight: A Liberal Case for a Strong State." "The aspirational India has no one to 
vote for, because no one is talkin= the language of public goods. Why should it take us 15 years to get justi=e in the 
courts or 12 years to build a road? The gap between [youth] aspir=tions and government performance is huge. My thesis 
is that India has risen despite the state. It is a stor= of public failure and private success." 
That is what Das me=ns by India grows at night, when government sleeps. "But India must lear= to grow during the day," 
he said. "If India fixes its governance befo=e China fixes its politics that is who will win. ... You need a strong state and a 
strong society, so the society can =old the state accountable. India will only get a strong state when the bes= of society 
join the government, and China will only get a strong society =hen the best Mandarins go into the private sector."
