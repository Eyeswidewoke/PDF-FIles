Others suspect that=lran is waiting to see how President Obama's new national security team =96 with Kerry as 
secretary of state, Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense, =nd John Brennan at the Central Intelligence Agency — will shape 
Obama's stance at any talks. 
In Washington, some=would argue there's a growing consensus, at the level of think tanks, Ir=n experts, and other 
analysts, that a preliminary, first-round deal, inclu=ing "shop, ship, and shut," might work, if in response the P5+1 could 
lift some of the economic sanctions on l=an and agree to limited Iranian enrichment. 
Perhaps the best-ca=e scenario is the possibility that there are ongoing, secret and back-chan=el talks between 
Washington and Tehran. Nothing along those lines has leak=d and there is no indication of this, yet. But in advance of 
the first round of Iran-P5+1 talks in Vienna in=2009, the United States and Iran did indeed engage in quiet, behind-the-
sc=nes diplomacy. 
In fact, of course,=any sanctions relief for Iran will occur slowly and step-by-step, not all =t once, in parallel with steps 
taken by Iran and openness to more intrusiv= inspections and oversight by the IAEA. 
But it's certainl= not helpful that in early January yet another round of unilateral sanctio=s was passed by Congress 
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/114936491/Iran-NDAA-as-Filed-PD=> and signed into law by President =bama. The 
complex set of new measures targets key industrial sectors, including shipping and imports of products such 
as=aluminum, steel and coal, and seeks to block Iran from using barter commod=ties such as oil and gold to pay for 
imports. =span style="font-size:18.0pt">The <http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/new=iran-

embargo, d=signed to systematically attack and undercut Iran's major financial pill=rs and threaten the country with 
economic collapse." Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) th=t contained the sanctions 
provisions despite having hinted earlier that he might veto the 
<http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/01/06/3116081/obama-=nacts-new-iran-sanctions> NDAA over a h=st of 
measures contained in the bill. 
If the Obama admini=tration believes that ever-tougher sanctions will cause Iran to cave in at=the talks, it's likely that 
they are badly misreading Iranian politics.<=span> 
For many observers,=however, and for Iran, too, the nomination of Hagel for secretary of defen=e may be a sign that the 
White House is beginning to realize that sanction=, and threats of military action, won't force Iran's hand. 
As has been widely =eported, hawks, neoconservatives, and members of the pro-Israel lobby in W=shington have 
slammed Hagel for his past comments and positions on Iran. 1= conjunction with Israel-friendly members of Congress, 
they've warned Obama to rein Hagel in so as not to send a d=vish signal to Tehran. Robert Satloff, executive direction of 
the Washingt=n Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), a pro-Israel think tank, warned =luntly 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hagels-nomination-=ows-doubts-about-obama-on-
iran/2013/01/17/dlcb9756-Sda6-11e2-9940-6fc488f3=ecd_story.html> that the White House should act quickly to 
make sure that Hagel backs away=from his previous views on Iran and at least toes the administration's t=ugher line. "If 
the White House does not take steps soon to correct that=impression, the chances for a negotiated resolution of the 
Iran nuclear crisis will fall nearly to zero and the lik=lihood of Israeli military action will rise dramatically," he wrote. 
Indeed, within days=of his nomination as secretary of defense, Hagel was already backing=away from his earlier views 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/chuck-hagel-iran=n_2443090.html> , m=eting with senior Pentagon 
officials and influential senators who'll vote on his confirmation to clarify his view= on Iran, asserting that he supports 
broad international sanctions against=lran and that he believes that the military option ought to be "on the t=ble." 
Several Democratic senators who met with Hagel announced with satisfaction that the former senator from Ne=raska
