The Whiteside. Lab 
Lab was large by academic standards (40-50 researchers) and produced groundbreaking research in 
chemistry and chemical biology, outstanding graduates, and original ideas that led to commercial 
ventures. 
The Whitesides Lab 
An ideal project for our group is something in which we start with a question that's fundamental science. 
We try to understand it, and find out how to apply it. We then build a prototype, and finally do research 
engineering. And 10 years later there's probably a start-up. 
—Professor George Whitesides 
George Whitesides was internationally acclaimed as a physical organic chemist at MIT when he 
returned to his alma mater in 1982 (see Exhibits 1 and 2 for Whitesides' bio and lab research themes). 
He joined Harvard's Chemistry Department and was given office and laboratory space on the second 
floor of an ancient but well-kept building two minutes from Harvard Yard. The facilities were 
characterized by an open architecture. The lab was over 6,000 square feet, with enough room for 34 
workbenches and tables. Scattered among the lab benches and specialized analytical equipment were 
the researchers' "offices," each of which consisted of a small desk, a file cabinet, and usually one or 
more whiteboards close by. Along the hall, rooms with computer workstations alternated with 
laboratories where each researcher had his or her work area. Walls were covered both with posters 
displaying results of current projects or with whiteboards on which lab members tracked their ideas, 
notes, and calculations (see Exhibit 3 for photos). 
The lab retained the strong culture of scientific rigor imprinted by Whitesides, requiring 
researchers to draw deeply from disciplinary knowledge, yet also strongly encouraged collaborative 
work that integrated knowledge and experimental techniques far from chemistry. New members to 
the lab were warned that while it appeared that Whitesides had a "hands-off approach," he 
nevertheless reviewed the status of each project regularly. Katie Drake Gudiksen, a graduate student 
who had been working in Whitesides' lab for three years, explained, 
Before joining George's lab in 2002, I worked in another lab. If I think about it, there were 
three differences between the two labs. First, George has a hands-off approach. in the other lab, 
the leader was the source of ideas and the work was driven by his authority. Second, research 
tin the Whitesides Lab] is much more collaborative. Third, the research is multidisciplinary. 
Researchers within their [project] group and in their interaction with George have the 
opportunity to look at a problem from different perspectives. 
Individual initiative and long working hours were the norm. The lab included over 40 members 
(see Exhibits 4 and 5). On average, about half were doctoral students and half were postdocs.1 The 
lab had produced over 300 graduates (PhDs, postdocs, and visiting scientists). Postdocs stayed one to 
three years, while doctoral students required four to six years to complete their coursework and 
thesis research. A lab administrator, two secretaries, and two assistants completed the lab staff. in 
addition, during the summer, six Harvard undergraduates worked at the lab, with two or three of 
them continuing during the school year. Researchers had very different backgrounds and research 
interests. As Whitesides described the mix, 
I The postdoctoral annual stipend was set by National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and ranged between $35,500 and 
$41,700 from the first to third year of an appointment. Graduate students' stipends averaged 526,000/year, some of which 
went to tuition.
