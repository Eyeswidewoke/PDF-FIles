SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
CERTAIN LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The offer and sale of the Interests in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law, and an 
investment in the Onshore Feeder Fund or the Offshore Feeder Fund may involve legal 
requirements, non-U.S. exchange restrictions and tax considerations unique to the Investor. 
The Interests are not registered under the securities laws of any jurisdiction and are being 
offered solely in a private placement. The Interests are not transferable, except with the 
prior written consent of the General Partner or the Investment Manager, in its sole 
discretion. The Onshore Feeder Fund is governed by Delaware law. The Offshore Feeder 
Fund is governed by Cayman Islands law. None of the Placement Agents, the General 
Partner, the Investment Manager, Deutsche Bank or any of their respective affiliates makes 
any representation with respect to whether any holder of Interests is permitted to hold such 
Interests. Interests that are acquired by any person, in any transaction or otherwise held by 
any person, in violation of applicable law, as determined by the General Partner in its sole 
discretion, may be mandatorily redeemed at no value or compulsorily transferred on such 
terms and conditions as the Investment Manager deems appropriate. 
Prospective 
purchasers should consult their own legal and tax advisors regarding such considerations 
prior to making an investment decision. 
Limited Partners of the Onshore Feeder Fund have certain rights to remove the Investment 
Manager and the General Partner as set forth in the Onshore Feeder LP Agreement. See 
"Summary of Terms - Removal of the Investment Manager" and "- Removal of the 
General Partner." 
Many jurisdictions are in the process of changing or creating anti-money laundering, 
embargo and trade sanctions, or similar laws, regulations, requirements (whether or not 
with force of law) or regulatory policies and many financial intermediaries are in the 
process of changing or creating responsive disclosure and compliance policies 
(collectively, "Requirements"). The General Partner could be requested or required to 
obtain certain assurances from Limited Partners or investors subscribing for interests in the 
Onshore Feeder Fund or the Offshore Feeder Fund, disclose information pertaining to them 
to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries, the Master 
Fund and/or investment funds of the Master Fund or engage in due diligence or take other 
related actions in the future. It is the General Partner and the Investment Manager's policy 
to comply with Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret 
them broadly in favor of disclosure. Each Investor will be required to agree in the 
Subscription Agreement, and will be deemed to have agreed by reason of owning an 
Interest in the Onshore Feeder Fund or the Offshore Feeder Fund, that it will provide 
additional information or take such other actions as may be necessary or advisable (in the 
General Partner's or the Investment Manager's (or their delegate's) judgment) to comply 
with any Requirements, related legal process or appropriate requests (whether formal or 
informal) or otherwise. Each Limited Partner, by executing the Subscription Agreement, 
consents, and by owning an Interest in the Onshore Feeder Fund or the Offshore Feeder 
Fund is deemed to have consented, to disclosure by the General Partner and its agents to 
relevant third parties of information pertaining to it in respect of Requirements, 
information requests related thereto. Failure to honor any such request may result in 
redemption by the General Partner, a forced sale to another person or entity of such
