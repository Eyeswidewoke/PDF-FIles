Table of Contents 
Until we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements generally unavailable to other public 
companies. Those provisions allow us to: 
provide less than five years of selected financial data in an initial public offering registration statement; 
provide reduced disclosure regarding our executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies, which 
means we do not have to include a compensation discussion and analysis and certain other disclosure regarding our executive compensation. and 
not provide an auditor attestation of our internal control over financial reporting. 
The JOBS Act also permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised 
accounting standards applicable to public companies. and exempts an emerging growth company such as us from Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. or the Exchange Act. which require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute 
compensation. 
We have elected to adopt the reduced disclosure requirements described above for purposes of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. 
In addition, for so long as we quality as an emerging growth company, we expect to take advantage of certain of the reduced reporting and other requirements 
of the JOBS Act with respect to the periodic reports we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. and proxy statements that we use 
to solicit proxies from our stockholders. 
We have elected to not take advantage of the extended transition period that allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting 
standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies, which means that the financial statements included in this prospectus, as well as 
financial statements we file in the future, will be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies. Our election not 
to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable.
