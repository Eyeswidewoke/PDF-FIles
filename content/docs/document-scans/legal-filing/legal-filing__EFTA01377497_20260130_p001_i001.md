Long or short, Larry Adam? 
Six market views from our Chief Investment Officer for Wealth Management in the Americas 
and Chief Investment Strategist for Deutsche AWM Americas 
Is Fed policy at risk from sharply increasing inflation? 
Core U.S. inflation is still running below the Fed's 2% 
target. As the U.S. economic recovery firms, core inflation will 
move up but will take some time to get back to target. Very 
stable inflation expectations will help to slow any rise, as will a 
strengthening U.S. dollar's impact on input prices. The rate at 
which U.S. labor costs rise is likely to be relatively modest, too. 
All this will help the Fed to keep rate hikes on a well-considered 
path 
Is the ECB fully committed to quantitative easing (0E)? 
BEM Earlier this year, when European growth showed signs of 
picking up. many wondered whether the ECB would complete 
its QE program. Recently, rather mixed economic data -and 
Greece - has underscored the problems that the Eurozone still 
faces. In fact, the ECB has moved to extend the range of assets 
availab€e for CIE purchases to give it more firepower if needed, 
should further threats arise from Greece or elsewhere. 
U.S. high-yield over euro high-yield? 
® The high weight of energy stocks in U.S. high-yield debt 
must be of concern, with oil prices obstinately low. But other 
measures of U.S. high-yield debtors are healthy. This is also a 
much bigger market than euro high-yield, which should reduce 
any future liquidity concerns.

Are emerging-market equities looking more attractive? 
stir 
History suggests that a Fed tightening cycle does not 
necessarily disrupt bull markets in equities. However, when 
valuations are stretched (as now) developed-market returns can 
be relatively modest. Even so, emerging markets may not be a 
good alternative. These markets are likely to be more vulnerable 
to Fed rate hikes and increased emerging-market corporate 
indebtedness could be an additional concern. 
Chinese equities - is further volatility possible? 
In 
Recent reversals in Chinese equities have been driven by 
liquidity concerns rather than fundamentals. Such concerns 
can be difficult to address by policy intervention: the Chinese 
authorities had to launch a wide range of initiatives to bring 
the situation under control. With investors unsettled, we think 
that further bouts of volatility are possible over the next few 
months, but believe that the market may start to offer buying 
opportunities in the fall. 
Is Value at Risk (VaR) still a useful measure? 
VaR attempts to measure the minimum potential loss 
at a given probability in an asset class or portfolio. This is not 
just a theoretical Issue because increases in VaR can result in 
automatic forced selling from trading books. A rise in the VaR of 
German Blinds in April, for example, triggered two subsequent 
waves of position adjustments by investors, taking Bund VaR 
to a multi-decade high. Asset classes that are fundamentally 
overvalued and also have low VaRs are probably most vulnerable 
to VaR-shock-driven sell-offs.
