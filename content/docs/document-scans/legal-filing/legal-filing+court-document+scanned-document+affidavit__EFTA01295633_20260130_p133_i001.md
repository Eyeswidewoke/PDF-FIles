2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
With respect to claims for negligence, the "existence of a duty is a question of law and 
depends on mixed considerations of logic, common sense, justice, policy, and precedent." 
Snyder v. Med. Sent Corp. of E. Wash., 145 Wn.2d 233, 35 P.3d 1158, 1162 (Wash. 
2001). The "existence of a duty may be predicated upon statutory provisions or on 
common law principles." Degel, 914 P.2d at 731. 
Here, Mr. Steadman advances two bases for finding that Green Tree owed him a duty of 
care. First, Mr. Steadman claims that Green Tree owed a duty to "properly r36] service 
[Mr. Steadman's] loans in congruence with any contracts that exist related to [his] loan." 
(Resp. at 15.) Because this duty, by definition, is identical to Green Tree's contractual 
duties, the independent duty doctrine bars a negligence claim predicated on this duty. See 
Eastwood, 241 P.3d at 1262 
Second, Mr. Steadman claims that Green Tree owed a duty to "conduct a reasonable and 
fair investigation in to [sic] the servicing history before taking over servicing of [Mr. 
Steadman's] loan and whenever any disputes arise involving the loan's servicing." (Resp. 
at 15.) Mr. Steadman does not identify any statutory provisions or common law principles, 
let alone any precedent, supporting his position. (See id.); see also Degel, 914 P.2d at 
731. Neither does he identify how the considerations of logic, common sense, justice, and 
policy militate in favor of his position. See Snyder, 35 P.3d at 1162. Mr. Steadman's only 
argument is that it would be "unreasonable" if Green Tree was not required to honor 
contracts formed between Mr. Steadman and prior services. (Resp. at 15.) That argument, 
however, does not address whether Green Tree owes a duty independent of those 
contracts. Faced with a vacuum of authority, the court is unprepared and unwilling to rule 
["37] that such a duty existed as a matter of law.'° Therefore, because Mr. Steadman is 
unable to establish the existence of a duty of care, let alone a duty of care that is 
independent from Green Tree's contractual duties, summary judgment on Mr. Steadman's 
negligence claim is appropriate. 
10 The determination of the existence of an alleged duty of care for the purposes of a negligence claim is similar. if not identical. 
to the determination of the source of an alleged duty of care for the purposes of the independent duty doctrine. See Eastwood. 
241 P.3d at 1262 ('Where this court has stated that the economic loss rule applies, what we have meant is that considerations 
of common sense. justice, policy, and precedent in a particular set of circumstances led us to the legal conclusion that the 
defendant did not owe a duty."). Therefore, in the akernative, and regardless of whether the independent duty doctrine applies 
to Mr. Steadman's negligence claim. the court finds that Mr. Steadman's claim fails for an inability to establish a duty of care 
owed by Green Tree to Mr. Steadman. 
F. CPA 
To a establish a CPA claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) an unfair or deceptive trade practice; 
(2) that occurs in trade or commerce; (3) p38] an impact on the public interest; (4) injury 
to the plaintiff in his or her business or property; and (5) a causal link between the unfair or 
deceptive act and the injury suffered. Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. v. Safeco Title 
Ins. Co., 105 Wn.2d 778, 719 P.2d 531, 535 (Wash. 1986). Green Tree argues first that 
Mr. Steadman cannot show an unfair or deceptive trade practice, and second that Mr. 
Steadman cannot show damages caused by Green Tree's actions. 
To begin, either unfair or deceptive conduct can form the basis for a CPA action. Klem v. 
Wash. Mut. Bank, 176 Wn.2d 771, 295 P.3d 1179, 1187 (Wash. 2013). To base a claim on
