I think Bill is finally getting the idea of how unique and at the same time under structured and frankly 
unsophisticated his financial, estate life ,and foundation structure is. However. I very much appreciated the 
fact that this time he at least said "thank you." That being said I am fully aware of the tediousness of his 
having to respond everyday to people asking for things. He is so bright in so many fields . but personal finance 
is apparently and certainly not one of them. I fully believe that between 20 -50 billion is an extremely realistic 
goal to raise for his foundation. It would take probably two full days of our concentrated discussion. Given 
that time lin sure he will understand the vast majority of alternative solutions.. I am well aware of his allergy 
to fees so I would spend the initial time soley as a gesture of friendship. ) 10 times more valuable than icahn 
milken or Washingtons stingy response. If he chooses to get his house in order( at least his children deserve 
as much consideration as the polio victims in Nigeria. ) the first thing would be to send three years of tax 
returns as well as his current will and trust doe s if any. IT would take me a couple of days to review. 
It is a remarkable fact that the personal financial profile and its benefits and burdens of someone of bills hyper 
wealth does not scale up from the ordinary super rich. To properly plan for both estate and current issues, It 
takes a full working knowledge of many different and diverse categories of law, taxation,and accounting, 
mixed with a vast audit experience . A necessary but not sufficient component is for example a full inventory 
of private letter rulings and the experience of their complex interweaving . As important as you know is is 
the reality and public relations of the practical . , i.e. how to give, to his children, public charities, donor 
advised funds. trusts, grats, clats, cruts nimcruts, etc while at the same time fully being cognizant of the 
extremely complex accompanying trust accountings. The following are some of the generalized categories. of 
law and securities required . 
Corporate,- partnership,- gift -estate-, trust, sales tax , bankruptcy, securities. insurance, international„ 
maritime,( airplanes) contract, real estate, litigation, . foundation law - divorce.. The spcci fie tax treatment 
of each cateogory especially partnership and its debt rules . In addition each has its separate and distinct 
accounting issues . A full working knowledge of personal, state, federal and local income, excise and 
capital gains tax is a requirement . .The subjects of charitable giving - trusts. . family law , art are some of the 
investment categories but also needs to include alternative investment, equities, annuities, , insurance and 
its unique benefits ,ie variable annuities etc, option strategies, swaps, futures ,forwards. hedges. and each of 
their own special commodity taxation. 
I recognize that friendship is only built over time. I consider you one of my closest friends. Few people ever get 
to sit up so close. I am very glad to with your encouragement to give Bill a chance to become pan of the
