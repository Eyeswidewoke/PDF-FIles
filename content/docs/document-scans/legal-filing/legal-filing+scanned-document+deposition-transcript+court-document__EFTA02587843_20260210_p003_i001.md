have had a FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme test and are facing challenges gaining access to certain prescribed 
targeted therapies. 
• 
Data release highlights: 
• 
In June, results from a new study conducted in partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
(MSKCC) presented at the 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting demonstrated that 
comprehensive genomic profiling of lung adenocarcinomas from patients with no or a light smoking history using 
FoundationOne identified potentially actionable alterations in approximately two-thirds of cases where previous 
extensive molecular testing on tumors was negative. Approximately one third of patients were matched to therapies in 
accordance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines, and approximately one third 
were matched to clinical trials enrolling at MSKCC at the time of testing. 
• 
In May, additional new data, also presented at the 2014 ASCO Annual Meeting, demonstrated that 
FoundationOne identified genomic alterations that prompted physicians to change therapeutic decisions in 28% of 
patients tested as part of a prospective study conducted in the US Oncology network. 
* 
In May, results from a study conducted by Foundation Medicine presented at the 2014 ASCO Annual 
Meeting demonstrated that FoundationOne detected nearly 50% more ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) 
rearrangements than detected by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) in lung carcinoma patients. These FISH-
negative patients with ALK rearrangements detected by FoundationOne could benefit from crizotinib, an approved 
inhibitor of ALK. 
Clinical trial updates: 
• 
In July, the company partnered with the Addario Lung Cancer Medical Institute and Bonnie 1. Addario 
lung Cancer Foundation to launch the Genomics of Young Lung Cancer clinical trial, a first of its kind, multi-center, 
international prospective study. This study aims to better inform treatment decisions in young adults with lung cancer 
by leveraging FoundationOne. 
• 
In June, a unique public-private collaboration among the National Cancer Institute, part of the National 
Institutes of Health, SWOG Cancer Research, Friends of Cancer Research, the Foundation for the National Institutes of 
Health, five pharmaceutical companies, and Foundation Medicine initiated the Lung Cancer Master Protocol (Lung-MAP) 
trial, a multi-drug, multi-arm, biomarker-driven clinical trial for patients with advanced squamous cell lung cancer. Since 
launch, the first patient samples have been received, and in July, the program announced its expansion to an additional 
169 locations throughout the U.S. in addition to the 85 locations that have been participating since the initial launch. 
2014 Outlook 
The company confirmed its prior guidance for 2014, including: 
• 
Reported clinical tests in the range of 22,000 and 25,000; 
• 
Revenue in the range of $52 to $58 million; and 
• 
The introduction of new features for the Interactive Cancer Explorer" physician portal, including outcomes 
collection capabilities, in the second half of 2014.
