Interest Expense 
Interest expense decreased $6.8 million, or 32.7%, to $13.9 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $20.6 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was due to a lower effective 
interest rate year-over-year, which was 4.03% for the year ended 
December 31, 2014 as compared to 5.27% for the year ended December 31, 2013, 
which primarily reflects the repricing of our term loan facility in 
December of 2013. 
Interest Income 
Interest income increased $48,000, or 38.4%, to $173,000 for the year ended 
December 31, 2014, compared to $125,000 for the year 
ended December 31, 2013. This increase was driven by higher year-over-year 
average cash on hand. 
Provision for Income Taxes 
Provision for income taxes increased $19.4 million, or 44.1%, to $63.4 
million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $44.0 
million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our effective tax rate was 
38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 36.0% for 
the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the effective rate is 
primarily attributed to prior year state refunds for the 2010, 2011, and 2012 
tax years which benefited the tax provision in 2013 but did not recur in 
2014. 
Net Income 
As a result of the factors above, net income increased $23.7 million, or 
30.3%, to $101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, 
compared to $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. 
Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2012 
Net Sales 
Net sales increased $196.5 million, or 37.6%, to $719.5 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2013, compared to $523.0 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2012. Volume growth accounted for 30 percentage 
points of the increase in net sales, favorable product mix 
contributed 6 percentage points and an increase in net prices contributed 1 
percentage point. Strong performance by each of our major product lines 
accounted for over 75% of our sales growth. The introduction of new products 
primarily under our BLUE Wilderness and BLUE Life Protection 
Formula lines accounted for over 20% of our sales growth. In preparation for 
the systems cutover from our previous ERP system to SAP, we 
stopped shipping to customers in December 2013 for a partial week. These 
sales were recovered in the first quarter of 2014 when we resumed 
shipping to customers. As a result, we estimate that $13.1 million of sales 
were shifted from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014. 
Excluding this shift in shipments, our net sales growth for the year ended 
December 31, 2013 would have been 2.5 percentage points higher or 
40.1%. 
Net sales of Dry Foods increased $157.1 million, or 36.2%, to $591.5 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $434.4 
million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Volume growth accounted for 32 
percentage points of the increase in net sales of Dry Foods, an
