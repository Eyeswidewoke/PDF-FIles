Prior to completion of this offering. IAC has provided to us significant corporate and shared services related to corporate functions, such as executive oversight, 
risk management, information technology, accounting, audit, legal. investor relations, tax. treasury and other services. Following this offering, we expect IAC to 
continue to provide many of these services for a fee pursuant to the services agreement descnbed in "Certain relationships and related party transactions." 
While we expect to incur additional expenses as a public company. including pursuant to the services agreement with IAC, we do not expect these expenses 
to materially affect our overall profitability or Impede our growth prospects. No additional amounts have been included in the pro forma financial statements for 
the incremental expenses that we expect to incur as a public company.

$443.5 million of Match Notes are issued; 
$800.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility; and 
no amounts are drawn under the $500.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. 
The $800 million in borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are assumed to be used as follows:

$403,666,663, based on an assumed initial public offering price of $13.00 per share (the midpoint of the offering pnce range set forth on the cover page of 
this prospectus) and less underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 
We currently intend to use all of the net proceeds from this offering to repay rated-party indebtedness issued to IAC after the initial public offering price has 
been determined, but prior to the closing of this offering. The aggregate principal amount of such indebtedness will be equal to the total net proceeds to us 
from this offering, assuming the undenvnters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to 
purchase additional shares. such related-party indebtedness will be repaid in full with the net proceeds of this offering. If the underwriters do not exercise in 
full their option to purchase additional shares, we intend to incur borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility in order to repay the balance of the IAC 
related-party indebtedness. The MC related-party indebtedness will bear interest at 2.25% per year and will mature within 30 days of the issuance of such 
indebtedness. We have assumed that the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares is not exercised, and $61.7 million is drawn under the Revolving 
Credit Faality.
