FX Blueprint: Dashing Buck 
Theme 1t5: NOK o'Clock 
The Norwegian krone has weakened somewhat vs. the 
EUR since the last FX Blueprint on Jan 1Q reflecting 
weaker crude primarily but also a Norges Bank that has 
struggled to make its mind up on what the main focus 
of monetary policy should be, headline CPI or 
household debt/house prices. 
The latest policy meeting would suggest household 
debt and house prices now have the upper hand again, 
although with the caveat this could change if the krone 
appreciates significantly. However, to be fair to Norges 
it is a nigh impossible job for any inflation targeting 
central bank to balance the dilemma of pockets of 
domestic overheating with external deflation. Add a 
solid CIA surplus and a triple-A rating and Norges Bank 
is stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
What this means for our outlook for the NOK is that the 
Norges Bank's NOK TWI projections matter more than 
ever. Deviations of around 2-3% or more are likely to 
be crucial over the next couple of rate meetings. 
Other factors/variables that will be monitored closely at 
Norges Bank are: a) total credit as % of GDP; b) house 
prices as % of disposable income, c) real commercial 
property prices; d) the share of money market funding 
in Norwegian financial institutions. 
These four 
variables have previously been identified as the key 
indicators the Bank monitors on an ongoing basis for 
guidance on longer-term financial stability, and also the 
main variables that will determine the additional capital 
requirements for the counter-cyclical capital buffer. 
Taken together. the dilemma of balancing the risk of 
domestic 
overheating versus excessive currency 
appreciation and subdued spot inflation is something 
Norway shares with a number of EM economies and 
also to a lesser extent with neighboring Sweden. 
However, Norway's dilemma is further reinforced by 
the lack of an output gap, Norway's accumulated oil 
wealth, booming oil & gas investments, extremely low 
unemployment, and large external surpluses. 
The bottom line, with Norwegian monetary policy likely 
to continue to be a compromise over the next couple of 
meetings, the best Norges Bank can hope for currently 
is that the correction in Brent crude lower will extend 
and weigh the NOK down. Near-term, and dependent 
on crude consolidating above/around $100/barrel, the 
re-assessment of the Norges policy outlook favour a 
higher NOK/SEK. Look for a return to the highs from 
late last year. Target 1.1775, with a stop @ 11.90 
(1.1440 at the time of writing).
