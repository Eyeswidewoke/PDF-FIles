The Fund will be denominated in U.S. dollars. 
For UK tax purposes, the Fund should be treated as tax transparent and should not. 
therefore, be separately taxable. Each UK investor will be liable for tax on its own share of 
income. gain, losses. deductions and tax credits of the Fund. 
The Manager intends that the Fund be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes. Asa partnership, the Fund generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, 
and each Partner subject to U.S. tax will be required to include in computing its U.S. federal 
income tax liability its allocable share of the items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit 
of the Fund, regardless of whether and to what extent distributions are made by the Fund to 
such Partner. 
It is expected that annual U.S. federal tax information from portfolio 
investments will not be received in sufficient time to permit the Fund to incorporate such 
information into its annual U.S. federal tax information and to distribute such information to its 
investors prior to when their tax return reporting obligations become due. As a result. 
investors will likely be required to obtain extensions for filing U.S. federal, state and local 
income tax returns each year. 
The taxation of partners and partnerships is extremely complex. 
Prospective 
investors, In particular prospective non-U.S. and U.S. tax-exempt Investors, are 
strongly urged to consult their own tax advisers concerning the tax consequences in 
light of their particular circumstances of making an investment In the Fund. 
Investment in the Fund is generally open to institutions, including pension plans, subject to 
the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (-ERISA"). The 
General Partner will use its reasonable best efforts to conduct the affairs and operations of 
the Fund so as to limit investment in the Fund by "benefit plan investors" (within the meaning 
of Department of Labor regulations as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA) to less than 25% 
of each class of equity interests in the Fund. 
Each prospective investor subject to ERISA is urged to consult Its own advisers as to 
the provisions of ERISA applicable to an investment in the Fund. 
An investment in the Fund involves significant risks and potential conflicts of interest.
Each prospective Investor should carefully consider and evaluate such risks and 
conflicts prior to purchasing an Interest. 
Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. 
Debevoise & Plimpton LLP is retained as English and U.S. counsel by the General Partner 
and the Manager in connection with the Fund. To the fullest extent permitted by law, it does 
not represent or owe any duty to any Limited Partner or the Limited Partners as a group in 
connection with such retention.
