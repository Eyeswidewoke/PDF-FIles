through the family healthcare company's FEMA-funded COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, and that Cherfilus-
McCormick and Nadege Leblanc allegedly fixed contributions using straw donors. Director Patel posted on X that 
Cherfilus-McCormick and her family "allegedly stole money from FEMA and then laundered it through friends 
toward her own personal benefits — including her campaign accounts." The article noted that she could face up to 
53 years in prison if convicted and that political figures, including Rep. Greg Steube and the Republican Party of 
Florida, publicly called for her censure or resignation. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Associated

DOJ, FBI Probing Top Trump Administration Officials Over Investigations of President's Adversaries 
ABC News (11/20, Faulders, Mallin, Charalambous) reported that the Department of Justice and the FBI are 
investigating whether senior Trump administration officials, including U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin and Federal 
Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, interfered with ongoing criminal investigations into President Trump's 
political adversaries. Prosecutors and federal investigators are examining allegations that Martin and Pulte enlisted 
people outside the DOJ, improperly shared sensitive grand jury information, and usurped FBI agents working on 
the cases involving Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James. According to the article, FBI 
agents first discovered potential misconduct when a key witness, Christine Bish, told them she had already been 
speaking with individuals she believed were DOJ investigators — including Robert Bowes and Scott Strauss — even 
though neither had authorization to conduct interviews or access case materials. FBI mentions include agents 
uncovering the unauthorized outreach, FBI agents attempting to contact Bowes and Strauss to determine the 
scope of their actions, and a reference to Martin sending a letter to a lawyer for an FBI agent involved in the Sandy 
Hook response that falsely implied the agent was under investigation. The article noted that AG Bondi had 
previously rebuked Martin for inappropriate conduct. The article assessed that the alleged improper involvement 
by Martin and Pulte may have jeopardized the viability of multiple federal investigations. Additional reporting on 
the story was provided by Axios (11/20, Lotz), Bloomberg (11/20, O'Donnell, Cook), CBS News (11/20, MacFarlane,

Continued Reporting: FBI Fired Veteran Employee for Displaying Pride Flag, Lawsuit Says 
The Hill (11/20, Fields) reported that former FBI employee David Maltinsky filed a lawsuit alleging he was 
"summarily dismissed" for displaying a Progress Pride flag at his workspace. Prosecutors noted that Maltinsky 
received a letter from Director Patel informing him he was being removed for the "inappropriate display of political 
signage," and that he had worked at the FBI for 16 years and led diversity efforts within the agency. According to 
the article, Maltinsky said the Progress Pride flag had previously hung outside the Los Angeles field office and that 
he was dismissed just three weeks before completing the special agent training program, which he described as a 
lifelong goal. The article further reported that his attorney argued the case concerns whether the government can 
punish Americans "simply for saying who they are," and that Maltinsky claims his firing violates his First and Fifth 
Amendment rights. The article noted that the lawsuit names Director Patel, AG Bondi, and the Justice Department 
as defendants and comes in the wake of President Trump's executive order outlawing diversity, equity, and 
inclusion initiatives in federal agencies. The Washington Post (11/20, Bisset) also reported on the story. CBS News 
(11/20, Video) broadcasted an interview with Maltinsky. 
Continued Reporting: GOP Senators Warn AG Bondi Not To Slow-Walk Release Of Epstein Files 
The Hill (11/20, Bolton) reported that Republican senators warned AG Bondi not to delay the release of Jeffrey 
Epstein—related documents after Congress overwhelmingly passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act requiring 
their disclosure. According to the article, lawmakers from both parties expressed concern that the Justice 
Department might cite "ongoing investigations" to justify withholding files, especially after AG Bondi reopened 
Epstein-related inquiries and President Trump publicly urged DOJ and "our great patriots at the FBI" to investigate 
Epstein's ties to prominent figures. The article noted that AG Bondi pledged to "follow the law" and release 
additional files within 30 days while Democrats accused her of planning to conceal information, citing past DOJ-FBI
