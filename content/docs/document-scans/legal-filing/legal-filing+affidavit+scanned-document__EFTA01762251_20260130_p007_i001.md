The emir, as well as his son, was educated partly in Brit=in, where he has been purchasing significant pieces of property 
and shares= particularly in enterprises in London, where he is almost at home. The most striking of these are the 
prest=gious London store Harrods, previously owned by Mohamed Al Fayed; part of =he United States Embassy building 
in London; the five-star Park Lane Inter=ontinental Hotel; the 72-story skyscraper Shard, the tallest building in the 
European Union; parts of Canary Wharf G=oup; the very expensive One Hyde Park, an apartment block estimated to be 
=orth more than $1.5 billion; about 20 percent of the London Stock Exchange= and shares in various companies, 
including Sainsbury's, the third largest chain of supermarkets in Britain;=Barclay's Bank; Royal Dutch Shell; the Anglo-
Swiss Xstrata, a major produc=r of coal; and Heathrow Airport, among others. Qatar has also tried =o purchase the art 
auction house Christie's and the retailer outlets of the House of Fraser. 
The United States became familiar with the activity of Qa=ar when its TV station Al Jazeera, the most important media 
outlet in the =iddle East, bought Current TV, founded by Al Gore, who received $70 million for his 20-percent share of 
the stati=n. Among the other properties Qatar has acquired or is acquiring in =he United States are liquid natural gas 
assets in the anticipation that th=y will be developed as liquefaction facilities like those in Qatar, thus becoming 
companies that will ex=ort gas from the U.S. Other holdings include the investment group Fi=myard Holdings, which 
bought Miramax from Disney. 
The country has bought a number of the advanced Boeing 78= Dreamliners, and a team of Boeing mechanics is expected 
to arrive shortly=in Doha, the capital of Qatar, to modify the batteries of the planes, and thus rectify the electronic 
problems that=have plagued the new aircraft. Qatar already has a large fleet of pl=nes that fly to over 125 cities in the 
world: in the U.S., they serve New =ork; Chicago; Washington, D.C.; and Houston. Qatar has now ordered more than 
250 aircraft from Boeing as=well as the European Airbus, including the latter's A380 and A330 jet airl=ners, Europe's 
challenge to the Dreamliner. 
In this buying spree, Qatar has been acquiring strategic =hares in major companies throughout the world, claiming that 
these are goo= investments. It also claims that it has no mission to conquer the world. Perhaps this is the case, ye= it is 
reasonable to expect that its large investments will begin to influ=nce economic and political decisions in the countries 
in which they are ma=e. The immediate question is the character of the political agenda that results from Qatar's great 
wealth. 
In fact, Qatar is now playing an increasingly political i=ternational role. It has become a member of important 
organizations:=OPEC; the Gulf Cooperation Council, which it helped found; and the Arab League. It has made a show of 
friendsh=p to the U.S. by allowing the use its air bases to supply American forces =n Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet Qatar also 
allowed the Taliban, which Am=rica sees as a terrorist organization, to open a bureau on its soil. Thus, the direction of 
Qatar policy remai=s unclear. 
Qatar has intervened in Middle Eastern affairs, especiall= since the downfall of Egyptian President Mubarak, playing a 
role in Libya= in Syria, and in Egypt. Its activity in Libya in helping to bring down the Gaddafi regime was said to have 
been=on behalf of the rebel group associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. 
In Syria, it is supporting and arming the Islamic Nusra F=ont, which is affiliated with al-Qaeda and is part of the 
opposition to th= regime of President Assad. In this Qatar appears to be competing with Saudi Arabia, which is 
supporting a dif=erent opposition group. Again, it has good ties with Shiite Iran, bu= it also gave $5 billion in aid to Egypt 
after the overthrow of Mubarak an= is giving it another $3 billion, thus aiding the survival of the Sunni Muslim 
Brotherhood. 
Qatar has become involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict, a=pearing willing to play a constructive role in that conflict's 
resolution.= In October 2012 the emir himself, accompanied by one of his wives, paid a visit to Gaza, where he was 
offici=lly greeted by the Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya. His visi= led to a $254-million Qatar project to rebuild in 
the Gaza Strip. W=th additional allocations, the gift totaled $400 million.
