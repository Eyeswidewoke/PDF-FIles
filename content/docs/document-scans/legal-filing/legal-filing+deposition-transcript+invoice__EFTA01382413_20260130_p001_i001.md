Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
AB ACQUISITION LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory." Topic 330, 
Inventory, currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net 
realizable value or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. This amendment updates Topic 330 to require an 
entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the 
ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is 
unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after 
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this 
pronouncement. 
In July 2015, the FASB also issued ASU 2015-12, Plan Accounting: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Topic 960); Defined 
Contribution Benefit Plans (Topic 962); and Health and Welfare Benefit Plans (Topic 965)", a three-part update with the objective of 
simplifying benefit plan reporting to make the information presented more useful to the reader. All three parts are effective for fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement. 
NOTE 2—PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE 
On December 19, 2014, in connection with the acquisition of Safeway Inc. ("Safeway", "the Safeway acquisition"), the Company 
announced that they entered into agreements to sell 111 Albertson's Holdings LLC (Albertson's") and 57 Safeway stores across eight 
states to four separate buyers. Divestiture of these stores was required by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") as a condition of 
closing the Safeway acquisition, and the divestiture of these stores was completed during the 16 weeks ended June 20, 2015 in 
accordance with the asset purchase agreements. The aggregate sales price from these stores was $525.8 million, including the book 
value of inventory. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Albertson's Asset-Based Loan 
Facility ("ABL") by $439.0 million. Revenue and income before taxes associated with the divested Albertson's stores for the 16 weeks 
ended June 20, 2015 were $298.8 million and $14.9 million, respectively. Revenue and income before taxes associated with the divested 
Safeway stores for the 16 weeks ended June 20, 2015 were $145.7 million and $8.2 million, respectively.
