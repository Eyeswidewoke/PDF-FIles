think the =heck stubs would be requested anyway and would provide them. =hris Kroblin agrees and thinks we should 
provide the check =tubs. 
b With regard to check stubs, there =re two additional separate issues: There is a check 
=tub which is separate and states that it is a "Christmas =onus" as per JE. I suppose that providing Kyle a =hristmas 
Bonus could make it seem like Kyle is being treated as an =mployee. Not sure if you want to include the stub or delete 
it. =nbsp; 
c. Second check stub issue. It =s my understanding that Kyle's pay was $240 less than it 
=ormally is during one period. Apparently, Stephanie loaned him =240 to cover the shortfall out of petty cash. He had 
not paid the =oan back, so, when he was let go, there was a deduction from his pay in =he amount of that loan (silly). 
The check stub makes a reference =o the deduction for the loan repayment. Does the loan of =240 make it seem more 
like he is being treated as an employee? =nbsp; 
d. Daphne also included invoices =ssued with respect to each payment made to Kyle, 
but the invoices =eflect billing at an hourly rate, rather than the daily rate reflected =n the check stubs, and the invoices 
were prepared by the office rather =han Kyle. I think that the fact that we prepared the invoices =ould come out during 
the process =e.g., if asked about invoices, Kyle would likely say he =ever prepared or gave us any invoices). Also, that the 
invoices =how payment at an hourly rate, which is different than the daily rate =n the check stubs, creates confusion and 
might cause =dditional scrutiny. I think that our preparing the invoices =ould reflect negatively and would work against 
us, so I have excluded =he invoices. 
e. Daphne also included the =ndemnity agreement that we make all contractors, 
vendors and suppliers =ign and which states that the person signing the agreement is a =ontractor, vendor or supplier. 
Under this agreement the person =ho signs it indemnifies Nautilus, Inc., Great St. Jim, LLC, LSJE, LLC =nd you for any 
personal injury claims arising out of the engagement as = contractor. It includes an assumption of the risk with respect 
=o dangerous conditions and activities on the properties, a release and = waiver of claims. I think it could cut both ways 
because it =oaks like we make people waive certain rights to work for us. On =he other hand, as Chris Kroblin indicated, 
the people who do this are =ot rocket scientists and are simply looking at the universe of =actors they have been told 
makes someone a contractor or =mployee. The document clearly states the mutual understanding =hat Kyle is a 
contractor, is responsible for his own evaluation of the =onditions on the property and for his own conduct, requires him 
to =aintain his own insurance and provides additional support for treatment =f Kyle as a contractor. Also, because we 
want to provide some =ocuments in response to the specific request on the questionnaire, on =alance, Chris Kroblin 
would include the indemnity. I =gree and would include it as well. 
f. Daphne also included a =ermination letter, which would ordinarily be ok, but also 
includes a =tatement that $240 was deducted from final pay to repay a loan =tephanie gave Kyle. I think the kind of loan 
we are talking about =ere might make it appear that Kyle was treated like an employee, even =hough paid as a 
contractor, And it is highlighted in the letter, =o even if we include the "loan repayment" check =tub, I don't think we 
need to highlight it in the termination =etter, so I am excluding the termination letter as well. Chris =roblin agrees. 
Decisions for you: 
1. Are you ok with my changes to the =uestionnaire as reflected in points 1 and 2 
above?
