Preferred Stock 
The particular terms of any series of preferred stock will be set forth in the prospectus supplement relating 
to the offering. 
The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including dividend rights, voting rights, terms of 
redemption. retirement and sinking fund provisions and liquidation preferences, if any, of the preferred stock of 
each series will be fixed or designated pursuant to a certificate of designation adopted by our board of directors 
or a duly authorized committee of our board of directors. The terms, if any. on which shares of any series of 
preferred stock are convertible or exchangeable into common stock will also be set forth in the prospectus 
supplement relating to the offering. These terms may include provisions for conversion or exchange, either 
mandatory, at the option of the holder, or at our option, in which case the number of shares of common stock to 
be received by the holders of preferred stock would be calculated as of a time and in the manner stated in the 
applicable prospectus supplement. The description of the terms of a particular series of preferred stock that will 
be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its 
entirety by reference to the certificate of designation relating to such series. 
Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws 
Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay or make more difficult unsolicited 
acquisitions or changes of our control. We believe that these provisions will enable us to develop our business in 
a manner that will foster long-term growth without disruption caused by the threat of a takeover not thought by 
our board of directors to be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. 
Those provisions could have the effect of discouraging third parties from making proposals involving an 
unsolicited acquisition or change of control of W. R. Berkley. although the proposals. if made. might be 
considered desirable by a majority of our stockholders. Those provisions may also have the effect of making it 
more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of 
our board of directors. 
These provisions include: 
• 
the establishment of a classified board of directors and the ability of our board to increase its size and 
to appoint directors to fill newly created directorships: 
• 
the requirement that 80% of our stockholders entitled to vote in the election of directors approve 
certain transactions between us and certain of our stockholders, including the merger of W. R. Berkley 
into such certain stockholder, our disposition of substantial assets to such certain stockholder or our 
exchange of voting securities with such certain stockholder for the sale or lease to us of securities or 
assets of such certain stockholder, 
the need for advance notice in order to raise business or make nominations at stockholders' meetings; 
and 
the availability of capital stock for issuance from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors 
(see "— Authorized and Outstanding Capital Stock" and "— Preferred Stock"). 
See "— Restrictions on Ownership Under Insurance Laws," and "— Delaware General Corporation Law" 
for other provisions applicable to us that may discourage takeovers. 
Classified Board of Directors; Number of Directors; Filling of Vacancies 
Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide for a board of directors divided into three classes, with 
one class being elected each year to serve for a three-year term. As a result, at least two annual meetings of 
stockholders may be required for stockholders to change a majority of our board of directors. Our certificate of
