cooperation toward integration across domains. To foster integratio= we are directing an intensified approach to 
building common procedures, complementary budgets, combined ex=rcises, and joint war games. 
An essential prerequisite for cross-domain operations is =ommunication and data links that connect sensors, decision-
makers, and sho=ters armed with kinetic, electromagnetic, and cyber weapons. Our investments, guided by the Air-Sea 
Battle concept, =re building increasingly robust networks able to communicate between each =ervice's platforms, even 
in a contested electromagnetic environment. Part =f this effort is focused on the systems and procedures for Joint 
Tactical Networking to connect today's ai=craft and ships with new 5th generation aircraft, such as the F-35 and F-2=. 
Two recent tests advanced our efforts to promote Joint Ta=tical Networking. In the first, an Air Force F-22 provided 
updated targeti=g information to a Navy submarine-launched Tomahawk missile. Similarly, in September 2012 an Army 
Joint Land Attack C=uise Missile Elevated Netted Sensor System (KENS) ashore successfully gui=ed a U.S. Navy SM-6 
surface-to-air missile to intercept an incoming cruise=missile, demonstrating the ability to extend the range of an Aegis-
equipped ship to well beyond the horizon a=d over land. These examples show how integrating capabilities from 
multipl= services and domains combine to provide greater range and more options fo= commanders. 
We cannot forget, however, that the enemy gets a vote. El=ctromagnetic jammers and decoys are becoming less 
expensive and easier to =btain, and they can emit more complex signals. Our communication networks will need to be 
resilient and redundan=. We are investing together in new waveforms that are resistant to jamming=while also building 
systems that can back up traditional satellite communi=ations. Through the FY 2013 Air-Sea Battle Implementation 
Master Plan, our services will continue to pursue co=munication network improvements through technology 
development, war games,=and the operational alignment of our Air and Maritime Operations Centers around the world. 
By improving our integration, we improve our combined cap=bility to assure access without expensive new investments. 
A more efficien= and effective force will provide a starting point for evaluating how and where we should address 
potential re=uctions in future defense budgets. 
Keeping up the momentum 
We continue to implement the Air-Sea Battle concept in th=ee main ways: compelling institutional change, fostering 
conceptual alignm=nt, and promoting programmatic collaboration. 
Compelling institutional change. The Air-Sea Battle conce=t establishes a "new normal" for integration between services 
so=they are able to conduct successful cross-domain operations. This approach will require breaking down traditional 
service a=d community paradigms. Each of our services and each of the communities (e=g., fighters, bombers, 
submarines, surface ships, satellites, cyber operat=rs, patrol aircraft, etc.) within our services have decades of 
established tactics, procedures, and traditio=s that may not align with each other. We will have to eliminate some of 
th=se differences to become a more integrated force able to operate across do=ains. For example, fighter aircraft may 
be used as surveillance platforms to support submarines attacking air =efenses, or submarines may operate remotely-
piloted aircraft to support Ma=ine special forces attacking a radar. 
This change will take sustained effort. We established a =oint Air-Sea Battle Office (ASBO) with representatives from 
each service t= lead day-to-day implementation of the concept. The ASBO sponsors war games and simulations, assists 
with ser=ice-level doctrinal changes, and advises on budget decisions. Most recentl=, in December, the ASBO hosted 150 
personnel from all four services for th= 2012 Air-Sea Battle Implementation Working Group. Representatives from U.S. 
Central and Pacific Commands, as =ell as their supporting components, played prominent roles during the disc=ssions. 
The working group made significant progress in solidifying the hab=tual relationships Air-Sea Battle will require between 
the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. <=pan style="color:black"> 
Fostering conceptual alignment. The ASBO promotes incorpo=ation of Air-Sea Battle concept elements in service 
concepts and assures t=e Air-Sea Battle effort stays consistent with and supports the overarching Joint Operational 
Access Concept. For ex=mple, Air-Sea Battle was incorporated into each of the services' war games=during 2012. The
