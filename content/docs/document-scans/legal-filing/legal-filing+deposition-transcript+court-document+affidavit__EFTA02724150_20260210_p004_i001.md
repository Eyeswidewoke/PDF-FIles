° The Estate's petition included additional retlind claims that turn on the valuation of the art work. including a greater charitable 
deduction produced by that valuation and deductions for greater fees and cost of administration than originally projected. Such claims 
are ancillary to and controlled by the ultimate determination of the taxable value of the an. 
The gist of Mrs. Sasser's responses to questions on direct. on cross. and from the court. was that she and the other Elkins heirs arc 
strongly attached to the art work. largely sentimentally: that they do not view those works as business assets. primarily because they 
simply do not need the money; and that they are determined to retain the an for life, re.. they would never be sellers. In response to 
hypothetical questions from the court, Mrs. Sasser did respond—also hypothetically—that she and presumably the other Elkins heirs 
might be br9•ers of Decedent's interest from a hypothetical willing buyer of that interest, but only if assured by an expert or experts 
that the price was fair: 
THE COURT: Well, would you be willing to pay a pro rata portion ... of the fair market value of the whole piece of an, of each of the 
ones that you liked. to get that I J percent interest that somebody else had? 
111E WITNESS: I would be willing to pay if somebody told me that it was a fair price to get that. and I can't say what is fair. ... If 
somebody who knew the an market assured me that was a fair price, then, yes, I would. 
THE COURT: Such as )the Estate's expert)? 
THE WITNESS: Yes. if he assured me that it was a fair price. I would buy it back. 
The Estates three remaining witnesses were tendered as experts in various aspects of the an's values and were "received" as such by the 
court: David Nash as an expert in the an market. the merchantability of art, and the valuation of an: longtime Texas lawyer William 
'I'. Miller as an expert on the nature, procedure. time, and costs of actions of partition and enforcement of restraints on alienation 
litigated on the basis of texas law; and Mark L. Mitchell as an expert on the valuation of fractional interests in property. The result of 
the combined. interrelated, and interdependent testimony and reports of these experts was that a proper application of the willing 
buyer/willing seller test would produce prices for the Decedent's undivided interests in the works of an substantially below his pro 
rata share of their respective FMVs. They concluded that any hypothetical willing buyer would demand significant fractional-
ownership discounts in the face of becoming a co-owner with the Elkins descendants, given their financial strength and sophistication•
their legal restraints on alienation and partition, and their determination never to sell their interests in the art. 
By contrast, the Commissioner adduced no expert testimony or other evidence to establish alternative quantum of fractionalsawnership 
discounts, sticking instead to his no-discount position.' He did proffer two experts as rebuttal witnesses. The Tax Court -rcceived" 
one of them Ms. Karen flanusMcManus• as an expert appraiser of modem and contemporary an. and the other. Mr. John R. Cahill. 
as an expert on "art transactions," but rejected his opinion as "not germane to the issues in this case." Ms. Hanus-McManus's 
testimony is best summarized by her stated conclusion that "there is no recognized market for partial intermit.] in works of modern 
an and contemporary an within the secondary markets, with the galleries, and with private dealers?' She would not state, however, 
that there had never been. or never could be. sales of undivided interests in such art: only that there was no established or 
"recognized" market for such fractional interests. 
The Commissioner appears to have ignored, or been unaware of. the venerable lesson of Judge teamed Ilan& opinion in Cohan: In 
essence, make as close an approximation as you can, but never use a zero. See Cohan v. Comm'r, 39 F.2d 540, 543-44 (2d Cir. 
1930). 
° Emphasis supplied. 
The Tax Court issued its opinion in March 2013.° Applying the "fictitious willing buyerNeilling seller" test to determine the taxable value 
of Decedent's undivided interests in the various works of art. the Tax Court ultimately held that such interests arc indeed subject to 
fractional-ownership discounts, but that the price on which the fictitious buyer and seller would finally agree would be the jointly 
stipulated values reduced by a "nominal" discount of 10 percent only.

II. ANALYSIS 
A. Standard of Review 
We review appeals from the Tax Court under the same standards which we review appeals from the district courts: de novo for purely 
legal conclusions: clear error for findings of fact'c"Clear error exists if we are left with a definite and Linn conviction that a mistake 
has been made."' We review mixed questions of fact and law de novo." We have long held that "determination of fair market value 
is a mixed question of fact and law.'"• As noted in the Estate's appellate brief, de now, review is appropriate here because "there is a 
pure question of law imbedded in the valuation calculus.'
