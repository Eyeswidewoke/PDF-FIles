prepared to speak up in a balanced and persuasive way. The traditional trade 
association approach of pointing to jobs created and taxes paid risks looking 
irrelevant if it does not register a debate that is shifting onto the ground of culture 
and ethics. The questions put implicitly to the sector will increasingly focus on 
what these jobs involve, how their profits are made and in what spirit the taxes 
are paid. 
One of the temptations of banks is likely to be to throw money at high profile CSR work, 
which risks being singularly counterproductive in dealing with a critique of their 
business models. For managers accustomed to being measured by returns on 
equity, these more qualitative benchmarks may be difficult. It seems to us that 
part of CityUK's work is in challenging the way its members approach this changed 
landscape. 
One of the marked tendencies of CityUK's membership has always been to try to 
outsource the sector's image to the organisation. Although visible CityUK leaders 
are vital, CityUK should chiefly be a facilitator for bringing stakeholders and City 
practitioners together and encouraging a common cause to emerge. Indeed, one of 
CityUK's key roles should be identifying and cultivating a new generation of 
sectoral leaders comfortable and credible on this ground and encouraging them as 
spokespeople for the sector. The sector's past narrative became all together too 
self-satisfied. It should start with a sense of humility, acknowledging its massive 
responsibility for economic growth and stewardship of our assets and savings. 
These things are genuine and durable comparative advantages but only with the 
highest ethical standards and quality of governance. 
Aside from thesequestions of culture change, it seems to us that the European issues loom 
very large for Britain. Financial regulation has already been moved to the 
European level, with bodies like the PRA and the FCA largely supervising the 
application of European rules. The coming year will see the outlines of a banking 
union negotiated for the Eurozone. If the UK is to remain outside this union then it 
needs to do so with a clear understanding of the consequences. The City's often 
aggressive posture on regulation 'from Brussels' has sometimes seemed 
indistinguishable from euroscepticism and has often been interpreted as such by 
politicians and by Brussels. In reality the City's interests in a single market for 
financial services in which Britian exercises genuine influence are much more 
complex than this and have not been well communicated to politicians. This needs 
to be a priority. 
Finally, as you noted, we have to be pragmatic about the diversity of interests 
represented by CityUK. The insurance and fund management industries rightly 
resent the fact that they are often bracketed with the banks. Moreover, the 
Independent global banks resent being bracketed with the banks that required 
direct support from the UK taxpayer. Even, the investment banking divisions of 
global banks resent the image created by the supposed values of their institutional 
trading floors. Speaking for this group of sub-sectors is not easy, especially as 
members are instinctively distrustful of each other and competitive as a matter of 
course. 
It is not realistic to expect the insurance or accounting industries to sign up to a narrative 
of culture change to the same degree as the banks, but this should not become an 
argument for trying to circumvent the tough questions concerning behaviour. 'The 
City' is a single ecosystem and this is how the general public instinctively
