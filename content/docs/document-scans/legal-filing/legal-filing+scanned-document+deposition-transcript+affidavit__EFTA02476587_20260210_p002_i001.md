in sept you and I agreed to 50% of phaidon . ,=you then changed your mind two weeks ago. and said only 5 m should 
go to m= as you were going to reserve 5 for later. and keep 10 for yo=rself. ( though im certain that the debt , and art 
space will also b= a write off. ) When I had previously said =s you and I sat in my dining room that i require most 
people to =AO pay for advice up front. so that I am assured that I will be properly=C2 compensated for my work when 
strategies that i devise get used. =AO you appeared to have felt slighted and said " are you=suggesting that i would go 
back on my word " I said no , you ar= my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts=get large people 
tend to get unhappy when it comes time to have to p=y them,. From day zero I said I think the minimum of 50 = 60 
million is the price of the transaction . though this was already much=less than our agreed number, never telling me 
that you thought that=was out of the range , but asking that i provide step by step details and =eview all documents so 
that they would be perfect which i did. and=C2 Taking your alan comments in the best of light , who you=will have to 
admit not one,not one , time in three years =has he ever initated a unique idea. (including the new tenant =n common 
idea,) lets say he made a contribution ,even that it =as 50 %. though no one could posit that unless they were wearing 
a b=ight colorful clown suit. you , after knowing my price , sent =o you in writing and told to you on the phone then 
asking my help in=execution, you then and only then told me that you had decide= in a conversation with brad karp 
that 20 was the right number for b=th transactions . Did bradeven know of our prior agreeme=t.? As you always say , 
why cant we sit in a room together , so tha= he said she said is kept to a minimum , I would ask that you I and Brad k=rp 
sit together. If you didnt do the transactions, its one thing, =ut knowing the price up front. , using the detailed plan and 
then not payi=g the price fully disclosed and asked for prior to execution h=s me baffled.
