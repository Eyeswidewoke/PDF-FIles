dividends paid to a U.S. holder and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of our units, shares of common 
stock and warrants, unless the U.S. holder is an exempt recipient. Backup withholding may apply to such 
payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification number, a certification of exempt status or 
has been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding (and such notification has not been 
withdrawn). 
Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a 
U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. 
136 
Non-U.S. Holders 
This section applies to you if you are a "Non-U.S. holder." A Non-U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of our 
units, shares of common stock and warrants who or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: 
• a non-resident alien individual, other than certain former citizens and residents of the United States subject 
to U.S. tax as expatriates; 
• a foreign corporation; or 
• an estate or trust that is not a U.S. holder-, 
but does not include an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of 
disposition. If you arc such an individual, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income 
tax consequences of the sale or other disposition of a note. 
Taxation of Distributions. In general. any distributions we make to a Non-U.S. holder of shares of our 
common stock, to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. 
federal income tax principles), will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, provided such 
dividends are not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. holder's conduct of a trade or business within the 
United States, we will be required to withhold tax from the gross amount of the dividend at a rate of 30%. unless 
such Non-U.S. holder is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and 
provides proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate (usually on an IRS Fonn W-8BEN or W-
8BEN-E). Any distribution not constituting a dividend will be treated first as reducing (but not below zero) the 
Non-U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock and, to the extent such distribution 
exceeds the Non-U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis, as gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the 
common stock, which will be treated as described under "Non-U.S. holders—Gain on Sale. Taxable Exchange or 
Other Taxable Disposition of Common Stock and Warrants- below. In addition. if we determine that we are likely 
to be classified as a "United States real property holding corporation" (see "Non-U.S. holders—Gain on Sale. 
Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Stock and Warrants- below), we will withhold 10% 
of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits. 
The withholding tax does not apply to dividends paid to a Non-U.S. holder who provides a Form W-8ECI, 
certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. holder's conduct of a trade or business 
within the United States. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as 
if the Non-U.S. holder were a U.S. resident, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. A 
Non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to an additional "branch 
profits tax" imposed at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate). 
Exercise of a Warrant. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a Non-U.S. holder's exercise of a warrant, 
or the lapse of a warrant held by a Non-U.S. holder, generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax 
treatment of the exercise or lapse of a warrant by a U.S. holder, as described under "U.S. holders—Exercise or 
Lapse of a Warrant" above, although to the extent a cashless exercise results in a taxable exchange. the 
consequences would be similar to those described below in "Non-U.S. holders—Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange 
or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Stock and Warrants." 
Gain on Sale. Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Stock and Warrants. A Non-U.S. 
holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax in respect of gain recognized on a 
sale, taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock, which would include a dissolution and 
liquidation in the event we do not complete an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of 
137 
this offering, or warrants (including an expiration or redemption of our warrants), in each case without regard to 
whether those securities were held as part of a unit, unless:
