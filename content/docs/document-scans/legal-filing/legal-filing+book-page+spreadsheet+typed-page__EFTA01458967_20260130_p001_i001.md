World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
partners to keep Britain in the EU. However, there is also a substantial risk that 
the deal struck is not perceived as sufficient by the British public to vote in 
favour of EU membership in the in/out referendum. 
The Juncker Cornmissron is following through on its piornise to reduce the 
deluge of laws and to focus on clear priorities. One of them is improving and 
extending the single market. Proposals have been presented for the service 
sector as well as the digital economy. Another is the September Action Plan to 
establish a Capital Markets Union by 2019. It seeks better integration of capital 
markets to complement bank financing of the real economy in Europe, e.g., 
with less restrictive rules for securitisation. Aimed at unlocking investment in 
Europe (additional EUR 315bn over the next three years) is the European Fund 
for Strategic Investment EFSI, which is up and running now. Finally, the 
Commission has tabled a proposal on the third pillar of the banking union, a 
pan-European deposit insurance scheme. The proposal envisages a gradual 
merging of national schemes starting in 2017 with a system of reinsurance and 
ending with a European backstop fund in 2024. Despite the longer phasing-in 
of the new system, Germany has already expressed its strong reservations 
regarding the Commission's initiative. Thus the time line appears to be more 
than ambitious. 
EMEA: Contrasting paths 
Growth in FIvIEA appears set to accelerate, to nearly double to 2% next year as 
Russia and Ukraine emerge from their deep recessions. Elsewhere, we expect 
growth to remain relatively stable or contract slightly. 
We're not quite ready to call the end of the recession in flussio just yet but the 
economy has shown clear signs of bottoming over the last few months. The 
recovery, however, is likely to be slow. Oil prices look set to remain low, likely 
prompting the government to rein in spending over the coming year. Access to 
financing will remain difficult so long as sanctions are still in place. Inflation is 
falling and this will support a recovery in real incomes and confidence. Overall, 
however, we would expect the recovery to be hesitant, with the economy 
bouncing along a floor for the next year or so. This points to a contraction of 
3.7% this year and a further 0.7% drop in 2016. 
The longer-term outlook is barely less challenging. Poor productivity 
performance and a shrinking work force should cap potential growth to 1-2%. 
Structural reforms are needed to raise the economy's productive potential but 
these seem further away than ever as Russia has pursued a more inward-
looking growth strategy following the deterioration in its relationship with the 
west. 
The outlook for Russia is subject to significant risks, mostly associated with the 
price of oil and geopolitics. But these risks are much more balanced, if not 
slightly skewed to the upside, than was the case heading into this year. The 
geopolitical landscape has shifted since last month's terrorist attacks in Paris, 
which have raised the prospect that Western leaders might soften their stance 
on sanctions in exchange for Russian support in targeting Islamic State forces 
in Syria. Whether this will prove to be the case is still far from clear. It will be 
difficult for the EU to start to remove sanctions as early as January (when they 
are set to expire) while progress in implementing the Minsk agreement 
remains so patently partial. But recent developments do make a reduction in 
sanctions at some point next year more rather than less likely. 
The economy has held up rather better in Turkey, the region's other 
geopolitical hotspot. After multiple elections over the last two years, the  
domestic political outlook became clearer when the AKP regained its overall
