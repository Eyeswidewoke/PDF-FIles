History of Academic Medicine 
received in the ATP. as well as how the 
opportunities they had to collaborate and 
network led to their later positions and 
successes. These unstructured oral 
interviews were tape-recorded by S.K., 
transcribed by NIH staff, and reviewed 
for accuracy by the interviewees. The 
transcripts arc archived at the Office of 
NIH History. Another author (B.S.P.) 
conducted research on the origins of the 
ATP when he was an associate historian 
in the Office of NIH History 
(2004-2007). He used a wide range of 
archival sources, including materials 
available from the U.S. National Archives 
and Records Administration, the Office 
of the Director at the NIH, and the 
Foundation for Advanced Education in 
the Sciences. 
Quantitative analysis 
In 1997, NIII staff created a database of 
individuals who entered the ATP, using 
the index cards prepared for each 
physician at the time of entry. These 
cards included the physician's medical 
school and year of internship. (For 
examples, please see Supplemental 
Digital Figure I, http:filinks.1ww.corn/ 
ACADMEDIA43.) During database 
creation, efforts were made to reduce 
transcription errors and improve the 
accuracy of information abstracted 
from the original cards. Records on 
associates in the early years of the ATP 
are incomplete, so we focused our 
analysis on the associates who entered 
the program from 1955 through 1973. 
We used these database records to match 
NIH associates who graduated from U.S. 
medical schools from 1955 through 1973 
to names listed in the Association of 
American Medical Colleges (AAMC) 
Faculty Roster database as of December 
21, 2007. The Faculty Roster is the only 
national database with appointment data 
on individual full-time faculty members 
since 1966.° We defined as 
"nonassociates" those medical school 
faculty who graduated during the same 
time period as the associates but did not 
participate in the ATP. Using the Faculty 
Roster database, we compared the 
associates and nonassociates on their 
highest academic positions achieved at 
U.S. medical schools. Because PHS 
Commissioned Corps positions seemed 
to be reserved for draft-eligible men,n we 
completed the analysis with and without 
women. 
We also examined active faculty 
appointments in 2007 by the research 
intensity of medical schools, as 
measured by 2003 fiscal year 
expenditures for federal research grants 
and contracts reported to the Liaison 
Committee on Medical Education. 
Finally, in July 2007, using online 
databases, we performed a name-by-
name matching process to document 
membership in two honorary 
biomedical research societies—the 
National Academy of Sciences" and the 
Institute of Medicinel'—as well as to 
identify recipients of the President's 
National Medal of Science" and Nobel 
laureates.'° We used the online NIH 
almanac to screen high-ranking 
positions at the NW in a similar 
fashion.'' 
The University of Washington 
institutional review board approved this 
study. 
Results 
Qualitative findings on training and 
networking opportunities in the ATP 
Our historical research showed that the 
men, and the few women, selected as NIH 
associates were top-quality physicians from 
the outset. In the ATT's early years, 
promising graduates of medical schools on 
the East Coast were recruited via the "old 
boys network,"' but the competition 
became increasingly fierce as the 
application procedure was formalized and 
opened to the public. In 1963, for instance, 
only 53 of the 1,464 physician applicants 
(3.62%) were selected to be associates." 
Donald Frederickson,'" one of the first 
associates in 1953 and, later, NIH director, 
commented on the competition: "The best, 
the absolute cream, all applied. The art of 
picking, out of a whole group of qualified 
people, those who might become successful 
scientists was extremely difficult." 
The ATP helped foster an academic and 
congenial atmosphere within the NIH 
that was unusual for a government 
agency. A 1965 report to President 
Lyndon B. Johnson characterized the 
NIH scientist as having "probably more 
'academic freedom' than his university 
counterpart"—with the freedom to 
choose his research topics, freedom to 
devote an his time to research, and 
freedom from the need to secure funds.2° 
The decidedly nonbureaucratic 
environment led to a high degree of 
independence granted to associates and a 
unique sense of collaboration within the 
ATP. "There was an incredible number of 
great immunologists around so it was like 
(being] a kid in a candy store," recalled 
Anthony Fauci,21 an NIH associate who 
entered the ATP in 1968 and went on to 
become director of the NIH Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "I 
learned this from this person and that 
from that person and that's how I taught 
myself immunology." 
The design of the Clinical Center on the 
NIH campus also provided a unique 
opportunity for associates both to see 
patients and work in research 
laboratories immediately adjacent to the 
center. "If you wanted to get an 
experience in clinical medicine where you 
could apply bedside observation to 
laboratory bcnchwork, the (ATP] was not 
the only program that you could come to 
but it was built for that," noted Dr. 
Fauci.23 "This was built for the sole 
purpose of 'bench to bedside and 
'bedside to bench.'" The clinical training 
provided exposure to a wide variety of 
diseases for which associates could pose 
questions and test their hypotheses in the 
laboratory. 
Training medical doctors in basic 
sciences research was a formidable task, 
however. "Unlike the university-trained 
PhD candidate," former NIH director 
►ames Shannon remarked (in 1957), 
"these individuals IMDsl have little or no 
training in research methodology, 
procedure, and theory, and so they are 
handicapped in proceeding effectively to 
advanced research."" A group of NIH's 
intramural scientists seized on the 
opportunity to produce a new generation 
of physician—scientists by offering the 
associates after-hours science courses that 
were not widely available in U.S. medical 
schools. In 1954, they formed the 
Scientific Advisory Committee to decide 
"subjects and fields for formal courses, 
course level, appropriate curricula, 
faculty, admission requisites" for the NIH 
evening school.:3 The committee 
comprised several institutes directors of 
intramural programs and other leading 
scientists, including Robert W. Berliner, 
Christian B. Anfinsen, Daniel Steinberg, 
Seymour S. Kety, Bernard Horecker, and 
DeWitt Stetten, ►r. As they came from 
academe. most of them already had 
professional teaching experience.
