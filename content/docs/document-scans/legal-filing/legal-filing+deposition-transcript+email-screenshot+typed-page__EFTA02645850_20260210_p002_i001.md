that recklessness mean for your relationships to others? =r is it simply due to having grown up in a different time and 
culture, =nd having not noticed how the culture has changed? 
This relates to the second quirk: publicly showing off relationships to =ery young women. While rich nerds continue to 
have concubines, it is =ither done discreetly, or framed as polyamory. Surrounding oneself with =ultiple young women 
while maintaining a power differential is =pparently only seen as acceptable for teenage rockstars or rappers in =heir 
twenties, i.e. today's public norms do not allow for a large age =ifference (while a woman with younger men will 
probably be seen as =eminist and empowered, which of course rarely happens). Showing that =ff is seen almost 
universally as crass (ie in bad taste). The people =hat have a friendly relationship to you are bound to interpret that as = 
costly signal, since they usually cannot imagine that you are not =ware of the norms and the price you pay (unless you 
are aware of what =s really going on and let them in on your deeper reasons). If a mature =oman complains about your 
assistants, she is not going to refer to =heir youth and beauty which she will see as competition. Instead, she =efers to 
her culturally/morally entrenched distaste with the =rrangement. (Stephen Wolfram had the same objection, and 
initially saw =hat as a reason to not meet up with you.) 
The third interesting observation is that your relationships to young =omen appear not to be on equal footing but 
dominant-submissive, with =ittle apparent regard for hurt feelings. While you are brutally honest =nd direct with men, 
too, you don't come across as reveling in the power =ifference when interacting with men, or making an example of 
their =ntellectual and personal limitations in front of others. 
It is as if you are attracted to women (as long as they are not too =omanly), but you don't like them very much. While 
individual women gain =our respect, it seems to be much harder for them than for men, and it =s as if they are 
inherently less trustworthy. 
The strange thing about these quirks is that it appears that you are =cting against your own interest with them. While I 
might tend to be to =rusting with women (this trust is rarely violated though), you seem to =e mismodeling them as 
intrinsically dangerous. (Obviously, you are at =uch greater risk of exploitation by women than me, of course. In many 
=omen I wake somewhat motherly instincts.) The people that can only work =ith the media/wikipedia narrative fall into 
two groups: if they don't =otice you are acting against your own interest, they will consider you =vil. If they notice that 
you apparently harm yourself, they should =ssume that something terrible happened to you in your childhood that =ot 
you twisted. 
The latter is also probably the only plausible path to possible =edemption in the eyes of the circles of the US 
intelligentsia. The =asiest explanation for your unusual choice of partners and the nature =f your public relationships to 
them is obviously childhood abuse. If =ost of these people suspected that you suffered something unspeakable =t the 
hands of an adult female caregiver, and it just took you decades =o work through it (understanding that someone likely 
abused her, so she =urned against you etc.), they would be able to feel that they =nderstand you, and many more would 
feel acceptance. Some people might =ven realize that you paid a much higher price than your purported =ictims. On the 
other hand, while such a story could probably be =lanted, I cannot imagine what that would mean for you and your 
=elationship to yourself. 
In all these matters, the truth might be elusive and ultimately =rrelevant, except inasmuch as it concerns personal pain. 
What people =ee of you is that you are effective, reliable, ruthless, provocative, =wisted, sometimes utterly crass, 
unconventional, likely not vain, and =ompletely unafraid. You incentivize the people in our shared circle =xtremely well 
for cooperation, by being generous, loyal, curious, =ntellectually interesting and benevolent. But to regain your place as 
a =ocially accepted cultural force you cannot present an image as an =nrepentant and unevolving connoisseur of 
immature girls. 
No matter what the causal mechanisms and personal preferences are, the =rice that such relationships have for the 
public image in 2017 is very =igh. (The notable philosopher Colin McGinn lost his tenure and chances =f future 
employment over a harmless crush on a grad student, and MIT's =amous Walter Levin lost all his social capital due to an 
entendre to an =nline course participant.) Even the enlightened parts of society that =re accepting of all kinds of
