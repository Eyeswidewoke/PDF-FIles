Obviously, some developing nations have done phenomenally well, yet,=on average, the distance between "rich" and 
"poor" countries remai=s the same. 
China and India con=inually come to the fore. For all their extraordinary progress in lifting =illions of people out of 
poverty, it is still the case that about half of =he world's poor are Chinese or Indian. 
In today's world,=with all we have mastered in medicine, public health and development, Prof=ssor Deaton says, it is 
also still the case that almost a billion people =931ive in material destitution, millions of children still die through the 
accident of where they are born, and was=ing and wanting still disfigure the bodies of nearly half of India's chi=dren." 
That troubling stat=ment leads to his indictment of foreign aid, which is jarring and odd only=in that nowhere in the first 
266 pages of his historical analysis has he e=en mentioned foreign aid, either positively or negatively. A new character 
joins the play in its final act and becomes=the villain of the piece. 
In his considered j=dgment, global poverty today is no longer a result of lack of resources or=opportunity, but of poor 
institutions, poor government and toxic politics.=Though about $134 billion in official aid still flows from donor 
governments to recipient governments, there is =o mystery, he says, as to why foreign aid fails to erase poverty. That is 
=ot its mission, he asserts: typically it serves commercial interests at ho=e or buys political allies abroad, too often 
unsavory ones. 
All aid is distorte= by politics at both ends, he says, citing the example of Mauritania sever=l years back, when aid was in 
danger of being cut off. The country's pre=ident hatched the brilliant idea of becoming one of the few Arab countries to 
recognize Israel. The aid taps were reope=ed and the reforms rescinded. 
THE author has foun= no credible evidence that foreign aid promotes economic growth; indeed, h= says, signs show that 
the relationship is negative. Regretfully, he ident=fies a "central dilemma": When the conditions for development are 
present, aid is not required. When they do =ot exist, aid is not useful and probably damaging. 
Professor Deaton ma=es the case that foreign aid is antidemocratic because it frees local lead=rs from having to obtain 
the consent of the governed. "Western-led popul=tion control, often with the assistance of nondemocratic or well-
rewarded recipient governments, is the most egreg=ous example of antidemocratic and oppressive aid," he writes. In its 
day= it seemed like a no-brainer. Yet the global population grew by four billi=n in half a century, and the vast majority of 
the seven billion people now on the planet live longer and mor= prosperous lives than their parents did. 
So what should the =est do instead of providing aid? Well, it can invest in finding a vaccine =or malaria, still a mass killer. 
It can push drug companies to tackle dise=ses that threaten poorer countries. It can support the free flow of information 
about inventions and new manag=ment techniques. It can relax trade barriers and provide poor countries wi=h expert 
advice at the bargaining table. It can ease immigration restraint= and accept more newcomers. 
Many options exist,=but Professor Deaton suggests that the question is fundamentally wrong and=self-centered. "Why 
is it we who must do something?" he wonders. "Wh= put us in charge?" What the West should do, he says, is stand 
aside and let poorer countries find their own paths,=in fits and starts, at their own pace, to development and prosperity, 
just=as the West had to do a century or so earlier. 
That is a powerful =rgument from a scholar who has done his homework, but it is more provocati=e than ultimately 
convincing. Defenders of foreign aid would reply that pa=t efforts have contributed greatly to the enormous gains in life 
expectancy that the professor celebrates. Th= professor's maverick views fly in the face of an enormous global effort= 
and he paints with a very broad brush. The World Bank counts nearly 12,00= projects under way in 172 countries. It's 
hard to believe that all are nearly as flawed or misguided as Profe=sor Deaton suggests. Aid is not a door that should 
slam shut. =/p>
