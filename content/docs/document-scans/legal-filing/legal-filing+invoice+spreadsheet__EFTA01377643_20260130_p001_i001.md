A NOTE FROM JACK 
We started Square because Jim McKelvey, our co-founder and my second boss (after my mother!), couldn't accept a credit 
card for his art. 
Setting up a merchant account was painful. The application process required lots of paperwork and took months. Banks 
asked for multiple credit checks and years of financial history. And when we were finally approved to accept cards, we couldn't 
decipher the rates we were paying. Then our first deposit was held. The entire process was exclusionary and unfair. 
Square was born out of our experience. We built a working prototype: a mobile credit card reader that plugged into the audio 
jack of an iPhone and an app to enter an amount and process the payment. But it took us a year to convince the financial industry 
to allow us to make Square broadly available. The problem was not with the technology, but with the system. 
We decided to make the entire system faster, more affordable, and more accessible. We gave the card reader and software 
away for free. We settled funds next business morning, which required us to advance money to sellers faster than we received it. 
We abstracted away the byzantine maze of interchange pricing to offer a simple fixed rate per swipe, which forced us to find ways 
to lower our costs immediately. Every one of those decisions carried existential risks that we trusted we'd be able to overcome with 
time. And we have! 
Creating more inclusion and greater equality in the global economy is both a social need and a huge business opportunity. 
We've made it our purpose: empower people with beautifully simple tools that give them an advantage where they previously and 
unfairly had none. Our strategy to realize that purpose is straightforward: grow our payments service, extend payments into financial 
services, and extend payments into marketing services. 
We've built one of the fairest and most efficient payments businesses in the world. We made it possible to accept card 
payments in less than five minutes. We priced all payment cards at the same flat rate and eliminated complicated fees. With 
Square Cash we've built a network that works for both individuals and businesses, online and offline. We believe sellers should be 
able to accept any type of payment, from cash to cards. Apple Pay to bitcoin, and whatever the future may bring, so they never 
miss a sale. 
The strength of this business is more than the money it generates. The collective power of our millions of sellers sustains a 
scale from which we can build valuable financial services and marketing services, creating reinforcing and virtuous cycles back to 
our core business of payments. We've made getting capital as easy as tapping a button. We replaced pen and paper accounting 
with real-time insights into sales patterns and customer trends. Everything works together seamlessly to help our sellers make 
smart decisions for their businesses. When they succeed, we succeed.
