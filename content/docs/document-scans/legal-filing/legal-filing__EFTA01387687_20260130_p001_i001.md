don't need the foresight to invest prior to volatility going up — pricing continues to look good as long as implied volatility 
remains elevated. 
Callable Yield Note Overview: Callable Yield Notes with Contingent Coupon are considered equity alternatives, which 
pay a coupon on a quarterly basis, provided none of the underlying indexes breach the pre-defined coupon barrier 
during any quarter (observed daily, on closing index levels). On final valuation day, if the performance of the least 
performing underlying index closes below the final barrier, investors will incur a loss of principal that is proportionate to 
the decline of that underlying index (max loss potential 100%). The issuer has the right to call the notes at par on a 
quarterly basis. All note terms, including coupon payments, and final redemption payment, are subject to the solvency 
of the note issuer, which for this offering is JP Morgan.
