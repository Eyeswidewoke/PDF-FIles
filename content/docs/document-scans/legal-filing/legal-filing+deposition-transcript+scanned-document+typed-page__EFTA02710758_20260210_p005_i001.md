"The minimum wage is important to raise, but it's not an economic policy," he said, as families trickled 
by, awaiting their turkey, wrapped in green and white. "You've got the divergence between really high 
corporate profits but stagnant wages, and when you have stagnant incomes with costs continuing to 
increase, people are going to suffer immensely." 
Neither state nor federal government is equipped to close the gap between the wages families earn and 
the income they need: The expiration of some stimulus funding has reduced the number of people who 
qualify for food stamps. Meanwhile, federal funding for heating assistance programs is lower than it was 
last year. 
"What's happening more and more is that a lot more of the people we have contacting us for help are 
the working poor—and they're starting to lose benefits that they'd gotten while earning less," said Steve 
Geller, director of Southeast Vermont Community Action in Westminster, Vermont. 
Vermont's unemployment rate, at 4.4 percent, is one of the lowest in the nation. But when people get 
jobs—even low-wage, part-time jobs, they lose access to subsidized housing and food stamps. They get 
less heating assistance and have to pay more for health insurance, Geller said. 
A single worker can earn up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level, or $1,810, and still receive food 
stamps in Vermont, said Faye Conte, with Hunger Free Vermont. That means a person who works 40 
hours a week can earn up to $10.50 an hour and still receive benefits, making Vermont one of the more 
generous states for public assistance. 
Still, there were 87,525 individuals receiving food stamps in September of this year, down from 100,087 
in September of last year, Conte said. The unemployment rate in September of this year, 4.4 percent, is 
just one-tenth of a percentage point lower than it was a year ago. That indicates that Vermonters' job 
situations haven't changed much, but their incomes have increased enough so that they no longer 
receive benefits. 
That doesn't mean they have enough money for all their expenses, she said. Hunger Free Vermont 
calculated that a family of four on two minimum-wage salaries can get around $1,000 in public benefits 
and tax credits, but they don't earn enough money to pay for all the things they need, including 
transportation, housing, and food. 
"People are making a dollar or two more and losing their childcare and housing subsidies," said James 
Haslam, the director of the Vermont Workers' Center, which organizes low-wage workers. "It doesn't 
encourage anyone to make more money under the current system." 
This summer, Vermont passed a law that allows working parents to earn a little bit more money before 
their state assistance through the "Reach Up" program—Vermont's version of the federal Temporary 
Aid to Needy Families—disappears. But other benefits have federally-mandated income limits, and 
workers are left with the choice of taking a wage increase, or more hours—and losing assistance—or 
turning down offers of a raise. 
Shela Linton, 36, of Brattleboro, spent years as a single parent making $20,000 or less a year. Then she 
got a job as a field organizer with the Vermont Workers' Center, and doubled her salary. 
But with that increase, she lost her monthly housing subsidy, worth around $320, her $160 worth of food 
stamps, and her fuel assistance. The amount of money she has to pay for healthcare has skyrocketed, to
