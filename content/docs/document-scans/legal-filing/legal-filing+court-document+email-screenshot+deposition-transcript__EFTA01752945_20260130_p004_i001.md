One stop Mr. Kerry =as retained is Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, where he is schedul=d to meet the crown 
prince, Mohammed bin Zayed. Abu Dhabi, like other Pers=an Gulf states, is worried about the specter of a nuclear Iran 
and has been alarmed by the reports of a potenti=l deal. 
Mr. Kerry got a tas=e of the political storm any deal is likely to stir up earlier on Friday w=en he met in Tel Aviv with Mr. 
Netanyahu. The Israeli leader derided the p=tential agreement as "the deal of the century" for Iran and said Israel 
rejected it unequivocally.

November 07, 2013 •= Here are the contours of the deal the Obama administration thinks it migh= cut this week with 
the new and improved Islamic Republic of Iran:<=p> 
• 
A "modest rollba=k" of the nuclear weapons program 
* 
Some "suspe=sion" of enrichment at key sites like Natanz and Fordow 
• 
Conversion of=uranium enrichment from 20 percent to less usable fuel rods 
• 
No end to plu=onium work at the Arak heavy-water reactor 
• 
No concession= on Parchin military complex, where weapons research took place (but that=92s the IAEA's 
problem, insists the Obama team) 
• 
No agreement =o ship abroad fissile material 
Key questions for r=ght now? What's a "modest rollback" exactly? How much "suspension=94 is suspension? Where the 
administration once demanded a "freeze," t=at's no longer on the table. Why isn't the US deal tied to what the IAEA is 
demanding, ie details on weaponization work? It o=ce was. Why is it now ok to keep fissile material in Iran? Once, the 
admin=stration insisted it had to go, perhaps to Russia. And what about the seco=d route to a nuclear weapon, ie 
plutonium and Arak? Now, no deal at all there. 
What do the Iranians get in return? Not clear, but Obama will pull out all =he stops. He hasn't got much latitude because 
of the sanctions rammed do=n his throat by Congress, but sanctions under IEEPA (The International Eme=gency 
Economic Powers Act) are at the president's discretion. So he could unfreeze certain Iranian assets =nd potentially nod 
and wink to foreigners now sitting on Iranian cash to d= the same. More importantly for Iran, the full faith and credit of 
Barack =bama would suddenly be behind them, and letters of credit to which they had no access until now could come 
uns=uck, helping ease the pressure on their economy. 
What will the Iranians have given? Nothing. Every single offer reportedly o=t there from the Iranians is less than what 
was offered mere months ago in=earlier negotiations; In exchange, every concession contemplated by the Ob=ma team 
is more than what was offered in earlier negotiations. Who's the better negotiator here? Did you have =ny doubt? 
let's deconstruct for a second the technique here: The Obama folk are pat=ing themselves on the back that diplomatic 
tactics they used with North Ko=ea are working with Iran, namely the "sequencing" of concessions by ea=h side, 
theoretically building confidence and allowing each side to back out in the case of bad faith. First, let'= assess the value 
of that process with North Korea: Three nuclear tests an= nuclear-ready missiles, nuclear plants online, and growing 
exports to rog=e states. That's good stuff. Second, let's look at what Iran's giving: Every single step is reversible, eve=y
