incorporation fee is $400 and service providers' fees are reasonable. Incorporation can usually be 
accomplished within 24 to 48 hours. 
An exempt company must have three officers. None of the directors or officers need to be residents of 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. There must be at least a president, a secretary, and a treasurer. The president 
must be a director but the other officers do not need to be directors. The president and the secretary 
may not be the same person. One person may hold no more than two offices. If the beneficial owner 
does not wish to provide directors or officers, service providers can usually provide nominees. An 
exempt company must appoint a local resident agent for service of process. 
A U.S. Virgin islands exempt company must have a minimum capital of $1,000 and a typical capital 
structure consists of 1,000 shares without par value. No bearer shares are allowed. U.S. Virgin 
Islands exempt companies are generally inappropriate for U.S. persons as such persons may not own, 
directly or indirectly, ten percent or more of the stock of the exempt company measured by either 
vote or value. 
Annual filing requirements are minimal. No tax return is required but a simple franchise tax return 
must be filed by June 30 of each year. The return requires the signature of the resident agent or an 
officer or director. The current officers and directors must be listed on the return but the shareholder's 
identity need not be revealed. 
Redomiciliation 
It is possible to relocate the domicile of a company formed in another jurisdiction to the United 
States Virgin Islands. This is usually accomplished by filing with the U.S. Virgin Islands a certificate 
of domestication and amended articles of incorporation, which will serve as the company's articles 
after the change of domicile, along with a copy of the memorandum and articles of association or 
similar document that created the corporation in its jurisdiction of origin. After filing these 
documents, along with a $500 filing fee, the foreign corporation is treated for U.S. Virgin islands 
purposes as if it were established there. This technique is particularly useful for clients who have an 
existing offshore company in a jurisdiction, such as the British Virgin islands, which permits 
outbound redomiciliations and who desire to take advantage of the benefits of a U.S. Virgin islands 
exempt company without having to transfer ownership of assets from the existing company. 
Secrecy 
The only information on the public record for a U.S. Virgin Islands exempt company is the names and 
addresses of its officers and directors. The identity of the shareholders is not part of the public record. 
The U.S. Virgin Islands tax authorities may inquire as to the identity of the beneficial owner of an 
exempt company., however, such an inquiry would generally be for the purpose of determining 
whether the owner is a United States person and proof that the owner is not such a person can often 
be provided without revealing the owner's identity. Should a foreign government desire information 
about an exempt company which is not on the public record, its inquiry must be directed to the 
sovereign authority, that is, the United States government. (It should be noted in this regard that the 
U.S. Virgin islands is specifically excluded from every U.S. tax treaty and nearly every tax exchange of
