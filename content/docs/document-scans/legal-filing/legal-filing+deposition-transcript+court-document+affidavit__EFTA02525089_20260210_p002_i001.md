> Intuitionist math fits together with automata theory. It turns out tha= there is a universal computer, i.e. a function that 
can itself compute al= computable functions (Turing completeness). All functions that implement =he universal 
computer can effectively compute the same set of functions, b=t they may differ in how efficiently they can do it. 
Efficiency relates to=computational complexity classes. 
> The simplest universal computers known are some cellular automata, 
> wit= Minsky and Wolfram arguing about who found the shortest one. 
> Boolean alge=ra is Turing complete, too, as is the NAND gate, the 
> lambda calculus, and =lmost all programming languages. The Church 
> Turing thesis says that all un=versal computers can compute each 
> other, and therefore have the same power= 
> I suspect that it is possible that the Church Turing thesis is also a =hysical law, i.e. it is impossible to build physical 
computer that can cal=ulate more than a Turing machine. However, that conflicts with the traditi=nal intuitions of most 
of physics: that the universe is geometric, i.e. hy=ercomputational. The fact that we cannot construct a hypercomputer, 
not ju=t not in physics, but also not mathematically (where we take its existence=as given when we perform geometry), 
makes me suspect that perhaps even God=cannot make a true geometric universe. 
> How can we recover continuous space from discrete computation? Well, s=acetime is the set of all locations that can 
store information, and the se= of all trajectories along which this information can flow, as seen from t=e perspective of 
an observer. We can get such an arrangement from a flat l=ttice (i.e. a graph) that is approximately regular and fine 
grained enough= If we disturb the lattice structure by adding more links, we get nonlocal=ty (i.e. some information 
appears in distant lattice positions), and if we=remove links, we get spatial superposition (some locations are not 
danglin=, so we cannot project them to a single coordinate any more, but must proj=ct them into a region). 
> On the elementary level, we can define a space by using a set of objec=s, and a bijective function that maps a scalar 
value to a subset of these =bjects. The easiest way of doing might be to define a typed relationship t=at orders each pair 
of objects, and differences in the scalar are mapped t= the number of successive links of that relationship type. We can 
use mult=ple relationship types to obtain multiple dimensions, and if we choose the=relationships suitably we may also 
construct operators that relate the dim=nsions to each other via translation, rotation and nesting, so we derive t=e 
properties of Euclidean spaces. 
> To get to relativistic space, we need to first think about how informa=ion might travel through a lattice. If we just 
equalize value differential= at neighboring locations, we will see that the information dissipates qui=kly and won't travel 
very far. To transmit information over large dist=nces in a lattice, it must be packaged in a way that preserves the value 
a=d a momentum (in the sense of direction), so we can discern its origin. A =ood toy model might be the Game of Life 
automaton, which operates on a reg=lar two dimensional lattice and allows the construction of stable, traveli=g 
oscillators (gliders). In Game of life, only the immediate neighbor loca=ions are involved, so gliders can only travel in very 
few directions. A mo=e fine grained momentum requires that the oscillator occupies a large set =f adjacent lattice 
locations. SmoothLife is a variant of Game of Life that=uses very large neighborhoods and indeed delivers stable 
oscillators that =an travel in arbitrary directions. 
> I think I have some idea how to extend this toy model towards oscillat=rs with variable speed and more than two 
dimensions. It may also possible =o show that there are reasons why stable traveling oscillators can exist i= id, 2d and 
3d but not in 4d, for similar reasons why stable planetary orb=ts only work in 3d. 
> To give a brief intution about a traveling oscillator as a wavelet: Th=nk of a wavelet as two concentric circles, one 
representing the deviation =bove zero, the other one the deviation below zero. They try to equalize, b=t because the 
catch up is not immediately, they just switch their value in=tead. (This is the discretized simplification.) Now displace the 
inner cir=le with respect to the outer one: the arrangement starts to travel. Making=the pattern stable requires
