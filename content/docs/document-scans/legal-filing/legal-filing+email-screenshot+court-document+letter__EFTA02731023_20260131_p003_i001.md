Epstein. Payments to Epstein, at an annualized rate of $23 to $26 million per year, was higher 
than the median CEO pay for Fortune 500 companies, which Fortune calculated at $15.9 million 
for 20217 The Dechert report indicated that the amounts paid to Epstein far exceeded those 
which you paid to other professional advisors.' 
Since then, members of my staff held several meetings with your outside counsel at Paul, 
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP ("Paul Weiss") and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck 
LLP ("Brownstein") to discuss your cooperation with the Committee's investigation. In those 
meetings, your outside counsel indicated that you were unwilling to answer questions regarding 
details of payments to Epstein. However, your counsel indicated you were willing to provide the 
Committee information related to tax issues involving the 2006 Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts 
("the 2006 GRATs"), the remainder trust into which the assets from the 2006 GRATs flowed 
into ("the remainder trust"), and the step-up-basis transaction. The Committee subsequently 
directed follow up requests for information to you on January 1r, 2023 and February 6ih, 2023, 
which you responded to on January 16'" and February 21, 2023, respectively.' 
While the Committee appreciates the information you have provided, the responses 
declined to answer several questions related to important tax issues concerning the assets held in 
the remainder trust, claiming that these requests were "outside the scope of the Committee's 
purview.i1 ' This claim is without merit, as the Senate Finance Committee has jurisdiction over 
all matters related to federal tax laws. Investigations into matters pertaining to the operation and 
enforcement of internal revenue laws are squarely within the Committee's legislative purview. 
Among the issues you refused to address were the extent to which you received excess 
distributions of income from the assets held in the remainder trust, important details on the 
mutual release of claims strategy that Epstein may have devised, and the degree to which you 
retained voting powers with respect to assets held in the remainder trust." This information is 
essential for the Committee to evaluate the means by which you retained income from your 
ownership of Apollo holdings while avoiding gift and estate taxes on the transfer of enormous 
wealth to your children. 
The Committee also remains concerned by your continued refusal to answer questions 
related to payments to Epstein and how such amounts were calculated in relation to any services 
provided. To date, the Committee has not received a sufficient explanation as to why Epstein 
was paid amounts vastly exceeding that paid to other attorneys and accountants involved in these
