and, any final disposition in person at the DOT Docket Offices between 9 a.m. 
and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The Docket Office 
(telephone (800) 647-5227) is located on the plaza level of the Department of 
Transportation Nassif Building at the street address stated in ADDRESSES. 
Comments will be available in the AD docket shortly after the Docket 
Management Facility receives them. 
This AD is required because TRFs, part numbers 340-166-205-0, 340-166-206-
0, 340-166-207-0, 340-166-208-0, 340-166-209-0, 340-166-210-0, now 
require an initial inspection threshold of 25,000 cycles-in-service (CIS) on the 
commercial (air carrier) models engines and 19,000 CIS on the business jet 
models. This proposed AD would not affect any other CFM56-7B part number 
TRFs. We have been monitoring CFM's revised life analysis progress since 
February 2005. CFM International provided to us the November 15, 2006 revision 
to the ESM to introduce mandatory inspections of the TRF. CFM International has 
been using a damage tolerant lifing approach, based on an FAA approved 
methodology for structural lifed components, to prepare life extensions for all 
CFM56 TRFs using on-condition life management. This improved life 
management process defines a first inspection threshold and reinspection 
intervals accounting for crack initiation and propagation. The previous life 
management process was based on crack initiation only. This condition, if not 
corrected, could result in failure of the TRF from low-cycle fatigue cracks. Failure 
of the TRF could result in engine separation from the airplane, which could lead 
to loss of control of the airplane. 
FAA's Determination and Requirements of the Proposed AD Back to Top 
We have evaluated all pertinent information and identified an unsafe condition 
that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design. We 
are proposing this AD, which would require revising the Airworthiness Limitations 
Section in the ESM and the air carrier's approved continuing airworthiness 
maintenance program to incorporate life reductions for certain TRFs. 
Costs of Compliance Back to Top 
We estimate that this proposed AD would affect 1,228 engines installed on 
airplanes of U.S. registry. Since life extensions are possible on condition, the cost 
of the proposed AD will be limited to performing TRF inspections. We also 
estimate that it would take about 3.0 work-hours per engine to perform the 
proposed actions, including the TRF inspections, and that the average labor rate 
is $80 per work-hour. There are no required parts. Based on these figures, we 
estimate the total cost of the proposed AD to U.S. operators to be $294,720. 
Authority for This Rulemaking Back to Top 
Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on 
aviation safety. Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the authority of the FAA 
Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope 
of the Agency's authority. 
We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part 
A, Subpart III, Section 44701, "General requirements." Under that section, 
Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air 
commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the 
Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is 
within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that 
is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.
