•

• 
Provide detailed information as to other banks that tra=sferred funds into secret accounts or that accepted 
funds when secret acco=nts were closed; 
• 
Agree to close accounts of account holders who fail to =ome into compliance with U.S. reporting obligations; 
and 
* 
Pay appropriate penalties. 
Banks meeting all of the above requirements=are eligible for a non-prosecution agreement. 
According to the terms of the non-prosecuti=n agreement signed today, BSI agrees to cooperate in any related 
criminal or civil proceedings, demonstrate its implementation of controls =o stop misconduct involving undeclared U.S. 
accounts, and pay a $211 milli=n penalty in return for the department's agreement not to prosecut= BSI for tax-related 
criminal offenses. 
"The department's Swiss Ban= Program is an innovative effort to get the financial institutions that fa=ilitated a 
massive fraud on the American tax system to come forward with informatio= about their wrongdoing — and to ensure 
that they are held respons=ble for it," said Acting Associate Attorney General Stuart F. Dele=y. "Today's resolution 
demonstrates that the program is working. BSI is paying an appropriate penalty for its misconduct =nd the information 
and continuing cooperation we have required the banks t= provide in order to participate in the program is allowing us 
to systemat=cally attack offshore tax avoidance schemes." 
BSI helped its U.S. clients create sham cor=orations and trusts that masked the true identity of its U.S. 
accountholders. Many of its U.S. clients also opened "number=d" Swiss bank accounts that shielded their identities, 
even from e=ployees within the Swiss bank. BSI acknowledged that in order to hel= keep identities secret, it issued 
credit or debit cards to many U.S. accountholders without names visible on the card itself...AO 
BSI not only helped U.S. clients shield the=r identity from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). but helped them 
repatriate cash as well. BSI admitted that its relationship man=gers and their U.S. clients used code words in emails to 
gain access to fu=ds. BSI disclosed instances where its U.S. clients would use coded l=nguage, such as asking their 
private bankers, "can you download some tunes for us?" or note that their =E2..gas tank is running empty" when 
they required additional c=sh to be loaded to their cards. 
From the beginning of the Swiss Bank Progra=, the department has emphasized the importance of the banks' 
helping to identify individuals who facilitate U.S. tax evasion and U.S. a=countholders. BSI provided substantial 
assistance in this regard...AO 
"An individual is not culpable simp=y because he or she is identified by a bank within the program," s=id Acting 
Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo of the department40.804>s Tax Division. "With that said, the 
department strongl= encourages those individuals and entities currently under indictment, und=r investigation, or who 
have concerns regarding their potential criminal liability to contact and fully cooperate with the depar=ment to reach a 
final resolution." 
Since 2009, the department has charged more=than 100 offshore bank accountholders, dozens of facilitators, 
and financial institutions. The department's offshore enforc=ment efforts have reached far beyond Switzerland, as 
evidenced by publicly=announced actions involving banking activities in India, Luxembourg, Liech=enstein, Israel and the 
Caribbean. 
BSI had more than 3,000 active United State=-related accounts after 2008, many of which it knew were not 
disclosed in the United States. In resolving its criminal liabilitie= under the program, BSI provided extensive cooperation
