LISTING AND GENERAL INFORMATION 
Application will be made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Notes to be admitted to the Daily Official 
List. No assurances can be given that any such listing will be obtained with respect to the Notes. The issuance and 
settlement of the Securities on the Closing Date are not conditioned on the listing of any Securities on the Irish 
Stock Exchange. As part of the harmonization of securities markets in Europe. the European Commission has 
adopted a directive known as the Prospectus Directive (which was required to be implemented by member states by 
July I, 2005) that regulates offers of securities to the public and admissions to trading to E.U. regulated markets. A 
directive known as the Transparency Directive which came into force in the European Union at the beginning of 
2005 and is required to be implemented by member states by early 2007. will among other things. impose 
continuing financial reporting obligations on issuers that have certain types of securities admitted to trading on an 
E.U. regulated market In addition, the Market Abuse Directive harmonizes the rules on insider trading and market 
manipulation in respect of securities admitted to trading on an E.U. regulated market and requires issuers of such 
securities to disclose any non-public price-sensitive information as soon as possible, subject to certain limited 
exemptions. The listing of Securities on the Irish Stock Exchange would subject the Issuer to regulation under these 
directives, although the requirements applicable to the Issuer are not yet fully clarified. The Indenture will not 
require the Issuer to maintain a listing for any Class of Securities on an E.U. stock exchange (or other exchange) if 
compliance with these directives (or other requirements adopted by the European Commission or a relevant member 
state or other government, exchange or listing authority) becomes burdensome in the sole judgment of the Collateral 
Manager. 
If and for so long as any Class of Securities is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. copies of the Articles of 
the Issuer, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Co-Issuer and the resolutions of the Board of 
Directors of the Co-Issuers authorizing the issuance of the Securities and the Indenture, will be available for 
inspection at the office of the Trustee. The Issuer is not required by Cayman Islands law, and the Issuer does not 
intend, to publish annual reports and accounts. The Co-Issuer is not required by Delaware law, and the Co-Issuer 
does not intend, to publish annual reports and accounts. The Indenture, however. requires the Issuer to provide the 
Trustee with written confirmation, on an annual basis, that to the best of its knowledge following review of the 
activities of the prior year, no Default has occurred or, if one has, specifying the same. 
Each of the Co-Issuers represents that, as of the date of this Offering Circular. there has been no material 
adverse change in its financial position since the date of its creation. Neither of the Co-Issuers is involved, or has 
been involved since incorporation, in any litigation or arbitration proceedings relating to claims on amounts which 
may have or have had a material effect on the Co-Issuers in the context of the issue of the Securities, nor, so far as 
the Co-Issuer is aware, is any such litigation or arbitration involving it pending or threatened. 
The issuance of the Securities will be authorized by the Board of Directors of the Issuer by resolutions 
passed on or about the Closing Date. The issuance of the Class A Notes. Class B Notes and Class C Notes will be 
authorized by the Board of Directors of the Co-Issuer by resolutions passed on or about the Closing Date. Since 
incorporation neither the Issuer nor the Co-Issuer has commenced trading, established any accounts or declared any 
dividends, except for the transactions described herein relating to the issuance of the Securities and, in the case of 
the Issuer, certain warehouse arrangements described herein.
