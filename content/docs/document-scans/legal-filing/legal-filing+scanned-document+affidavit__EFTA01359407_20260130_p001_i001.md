WHY ARE THE RICH AND POWERFUL SO IN THRALL TO MAXWELL'S DAILY MAIL 
(London) January 10, 2015 Saturday 
Sjoberg stated that she met Epstein three years ago when Ghislaine Maxwell approached 
her . . . to work around Epstein's house. Maxwell told her they needed some girls to work 
at the house to answer phones and run errands,' it says. 
Sjoberg, a pretty, 23-year-old student, was allegedly later asked by Epstein to provide 
erotic massage. 
In 2009, lawyers preparing a case against Epstein meanwhile took a deposition from 
Alfredo Rodriguez, Epstein's former housekeeper. In it, he claimed that Ms Maxwell kept 
an office under the stairs in the Palm Beach property, saying her computer contained a list 
of girls who came to give massages there, along with their phone numbers. 
Rodriguez further claimed that Maxwell kept nude pictures of some of these girls on the 
device. He believed these photos had been taken without the young women's knowledge. I 
don't think they knew they were being photographed,' he said. 
Then there are the extraordinary, but disputed, claims by Roberts, who alleges that she 
spent four years as Epstein's slave' after being introduced to him at the age of 15 by 
Maxwell whom she'd met while working at a local beauty spa. 
On her first visit to Epstein's home, where she'd been offered work as a masseur, she was 
led into a bedroom, where Epstein was lying naked on a table. 
After she had rubbed his back for 40 minutes, the tycoon rolled over, exposing himself, she 
claims. 
A legal paper dating back to 2009 claims Ms Maxwell then took off her own shirt and left 
on her underwear and started rubbing the upper part of her body across Epstein's body, 
showing Roberts what she was supposed to do. 
Maxwell then told [Roberts] to take off her own clothes . . The encounter escalated.' 
Roberts claims to have subsequently joined a harem paid $200 a time to provide erotic 
massages to Epstein and his friends including, she alleges, Prince Andrew in exclusive 
locations around the world. 
Jeffrey loved the latex outfits Ghislaine had for us girls,' reads a 2011 court filing. He had 
bondage outfits, he had all different kinds of outfits, but his favourite was the schoolgirl. 
Ghislaine would take me to dress up to surprise Jeffrey ... that would include wearing a tiny 
little skirt with nothing underneath.' 
Regarding Roberts' claims, Ms Maxwell's spokesman said this week: Each time the story 
is retold it changes, with new salacious details about public figures ... the claims are 
obvious lies and should be treated as such.' 
It was also claimed in court papers unearthed this week that Ms Maxwell, to dodge 
questions about these allegations, lied to lawyers that she had to return to the UK and had 
no plans to return to the U.S. because her elderly mother was deathly ill'. 
However, Ms Maxwell then popped up at Bill Clinton's daughter's wedding in America the 
following month.
