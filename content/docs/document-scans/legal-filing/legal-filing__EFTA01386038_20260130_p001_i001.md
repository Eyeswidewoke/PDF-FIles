Special Report: Argentina - Position tor the upturn 
residual gain at these levels (entry: 95bp; current: 77bp; 
target: 70bp). 
The BONARs - The local law bonds have lost their 
prominence since Argentina reopened its international 
markets in 2016, but in our view some of the less liquid 
bond at the shorter end of the curve offer attractive 
value for taking Argentina's credit exposure. During 
this year's rally, BONARs have underperformed NY law 
counterparts due to real investors increasing their 
overweight on the latter. Interestingly, BONAR 25s and 
27s are actually trading inside corresponding ARGENT 
bonds. The value on the SONAR curve clearly 
concentrate at the front end (up to the 22s), but 
liquidity could be an issue. 
Going provincial 
Among Argentina provincial bonds, 
we retain a preference for 7-year bonds from the 
Argentine provinces of Cordoba (Province of Cordoba 
7.45% '24s) and Salta (Province of Salta 9.125% '24s) 
due to relatively low leverage and superior credit 
metrics within the Argentine provinces, expected 
increase in government transfers as per favorable 
supreme court ruling in 2016, 
positive reform 
momentum in Argentina, superior relative value within 
Argentine quasi-sovereign and provincial credits. See 
graph below for a snapshot of provincial bonds' 
valuation in comparison with the sovereign curve.

GOP War runts - With economists revising up their GDP 
growth forecasts for the 2017 and 2018 recently, there 
has been some renewed interest in GDP Warrants, 
which have outperformed bonds over the past couple 
of weeks. In our view, it is perhaps a bit too early to be 
overly excited about the Warrants. A 2017 growth 
potentially exceeding 3% - clarity of which could be 
obtained in the coming months via looking at higher 
frequency proxy data - will indeed force government to 
stop procrastinating on the tricky issue of base case 
GDP interpretation (likely with a re-launch of buybacks). 
We remain constructive on the Warrants due to our 
longstanding view that the government will go with the 
market friendly resolution to this issue but after the 
recent rally we would only look to buy on dips given 
the uncertainty in growth. Our economist calls for a 
below trigger level of 2.8% for 2017. 
Concluding remarks 
The current pro-growth policy mix will likely continue 
to favor equities, but It will also impose limitations on 
fiscal tightening: on the pace of disinf€ation, fixed 
income 
returns, 
and 
currency 
adjustment. 
The 
combination - which will support additional (mild) real 
peso appreciation and high real rates in the near term -
bodes for positioning for short-end carry and floating 
rates. Valuation and the prospect of back-loaded FX 
depreciation supports duration extension via USD debt. 
The choke of instrument in local markets is important 
at this stage where Argentina's markets are not 
trending anymore and because 0 wide dispersion in 
valuations. The macro dynamics favors floating rates 
over fixed rate instruments given both supply and 
monetary policy risks as well as valuation, although the 
latter is clouded by market segmentation. A deeper 
look at the valuation via our fixed-rate implied yield 
model helps support our macro intuition. 
While valuation in credit looks tight vs. its current 
credit standing, there are a number of reasons for u to 
believe there is still scope for further tightening. In 
addition, alternative instruments (with spread pickups) 
offered by EUR bonds, select local law USD bonds, and 
select provincial bonds also enhance the attractiveness 
in this space.
