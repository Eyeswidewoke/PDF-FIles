Perhaps the most significant of the human rights points is the submission that rape trials in Sweden arc held 
behind closed doors. This court is being asked, it is said, to surrender a man for a secret trial, contrary to article 
47 of the Charter, article 6 of the ECHR and to the UK's fundamental constitutional principles. 
Article 6 ECHR reads, in part: 
(1) In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and 
public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgement shall 
be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or pan of the trial in 
the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the 
interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, of to the extent 
strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would 
prejudice the interests of justice. 
Evidence was heard on this point. It does indeed appear to be the case that in almost all rape trials the evidence 
at least is heard privately. The judgment is pronoucned publicly. Any final decision as to public or private trial is 
taken by the court. It may very well be that in most cases all parties are content with this process. However 
there have been some cases where the defendant asked for a public trial and this was refused. The notion of a 
trial that is not heard in public is certainly alien as far as our system is concerned, at the least for adults. In the 
youth court, trials (including trials on allegations of rape) arc heard without access for the general public. The 
press is permitted to attend but with significant restrictions on what can be published. Less significantly, it is not 
unknown in our trial process for there to be reporting restrictions at least until the trial concludes. 
Mr Robertson says that "Any sense of fair play — that justice must be seen to be done — revolts at this Swedish 
practice". The question for me is whether it offends against article 6 and other fundamental rights. I have been 
referred to Fedje v Sweden. However I have not been referred to any significant body of European Court 
Cases that show that the Swedish practice in rape cases offends against article 6. Article 6 specifically envisages 
circumstances where the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the hearing. Apparently the 
practice in Sweden is long-standing. One assumes that rape allegations are not that uncommon. If the Swedish 
practice was in fundamental and flagrant breach of human rights I would expect there to be a body of cases 
against Sweden confirming that. In fact I think the position is more subtle and less stark than Mr Robertson 
suggests. His own witness, Mr Alhem, who is dearly a thoughtful man and much attached to the principle of 
fairness, was in two minds about the issue. 
It is fair to say that there has been an argument in other jurisdictions, including our own, that some cases should 
not be publicised or evidence reported. There can be no doubt that Sweden incorporates article 6 principles into 
its judicial system. Because that country has reached a different conclusion on the appropriate balance between 
privacy and open justice does not mean that their practice offends against article 6. I am satisfied that the 
appropriate test is applied in Sweden and that if a decision is taken to hold a trial in private then that will be after 
the necessary balancing has been undertaken, and will not breach article 6 or any other fundamental human right. 
There was at one stage a suggestion that Mr Assange could be extradited to the USA (possibly to Guantanamo 
Bay or to execution as a traitor). The only live evidence on the point came from the defence witness Mr Alhem
