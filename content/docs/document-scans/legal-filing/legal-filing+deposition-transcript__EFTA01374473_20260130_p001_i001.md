Mr. Deering served as a Director at Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Company from April 30, 2003 until 
November 17, 2017. He served as an Independent Trustee of Vornado Realty Trust from 2004 to December 
31, 2012. He served as an Independent Director of Mercantile Bankshares Corp. from April 30, 2003 to 
November 17, 2017. He received BS degree from Drexel University and MBA degree from Wharton School, 
University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Deering passed away on November 17, 2017 with an estimated net worth of 
$85 million that was left to his wife Kathryn Deering. 
His daughter, Heather Deering Crosby is founder and employee of Matheys Lane Capital Management L.P., a 
private equity company. Heather is Managing Director, Limited Partner and has served as Managing 
Director, Limited Partner since 10/01/2008. Heather Crosby has an ownership stake in Matheys Lane Capital 
Management L.P. of more than 75%. Crosby previously worked as a partner at Rex Capital Advisors, as a vice 
president at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and as a trader and a banker at Goldman Sachs & Co. Crosby earned 
her MBA from Harvard Business School and her bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College. 
Opportunities and Challenges 
We have several opportunities to pursue with the Deering/Crosby family as outlined below. There are a few 
challenges. First, Heather Crosby runs an RIA that helps manage the Deering family assets. The RIA has 
pushed for an overly simple, low fee asset allocation. Despite serving as an RIA, they seem relatively 
unsophisticated. The Crosby assets are not managed by the RIA, and Heather handles this account more 
directly despite having limited time to focus on it. Her husband is a private equity partner, and earns a lot of 
money, so perhaps portfolio management isn't the first priority. Finally, the family and the RIA seem to have 
relationships with every bank on the street, so there is lots of competition. 
Deering —given the recent passing of Tony Deering, there will be a continued opportunity to reevaluate the 
asset allocation as his assets are passed to his wife and eventually to the rest of his family. We recently 
repriced a margin loan for the account 
Crosby - we would like to have more influence over how this account is traded. Heather has engaged 
directly in some options transactions, but has been resistant to doing anything more systematic like Harvest 
or structured notes. There is much more we could be doing if she were willing to hand over some control or 
focus more. She is contemplating a residency change to Florida and needs to do some estate planning, so 
this will be an opportunity for us to help and deepen the relationship. 
RIA — There is real potential upside for us to get some business done with the RIA directly or with their other 
clients. They have not been willing to engage in that discussion to date. We may be viewed as a competitor 
more than a provider here. We need to learn more to understand this better.
