2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
the Plaintiff lost millions of dollars; (2) BIC's involvement in those transactions as the 
Plaintiff's broker and agent; (3) the rvi duties BIC owed to the Plaintiff arising from their 
working relationship and course of dealings; and (4) BIC's breach of those duties through 
its alleged misrepresentations and suppression of material facts, among other things. (See 
id.) The Plaintiffs claims are discussed in more detail below, but the TAC clearly contains 
plausible claims with much more than conclusory statements or threadbare recitals of the 
elements of a cause of action. 
BIC next argues that the TAC violates Rule 8(a)(2) and Rule 8(d)(1). (Doc. 65 at 3-5.) Rule 
8(a)(2) provides that a complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim 
showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Rule 8(d)(1) provides 
that "[e]ach allegation must be simple, concise, and direct." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1). While 
the TAC is somewhat sprawling, with some paragraphs appearing repetitive and 
unnecessary, the undersigned acknowledges that the length and repetition is due, in part, 
to the fact that the Plaintiff has restated certain allegations to cure shotgun pleading 
deficiencies in the Second Amended Complaint. (Compare doc. 64, with doc. 31.) In the 
Court's Order granting the Plaintiff leave to file its Proposed Second Amended Complaint 
("PSAC"), United States District Judge Kristi K. DuBose risj noted that 
the PSAC is a "shotgun pleading." as it "incorporate(s) every antecedent allegation by reference into each subsequent 
claim for relief 
' Wagner v. First Horizon Pharrn. Corp.. 464 F.3d 1273. 1279 (11th Cir. 2006). The Eleventh Circuit 
greatly disfavors such pleadings. see. e.g.. id. . . However, having reviewed the PSAC. the Court does not find it 
confusing on its face and will not sue sponte deny amendment on this basis. 
(Doc. 30 at 7-8.) After the Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint (doc. 31), the 
Defendants filed motions for a more definite statement (dots. 46 and 49), and the Plaintiff, 
subsequently, filed the TAC to clarify its claims. The undersigned agrees with the Plaintiff 
that, at this point, its claims are sufficiently clear. The TAC gives BIC fair notice of the 
Plaintiff's claims "and the grounds upon which [they] rest," such that it allows BIC to frame 
a responsive pleading. Accordingly, the undersigned finds that the TAC complies with the 
pleading requirements of Rule 8. 
6 See Twombly. 550 U.S. at 556. 127 S. Ct. at 1964-65 (observing that Rule l3(a)(2) requires that the pleading "'give the 
defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests" (quoting Conley v. Gibson. 355 U.S. 41. 47. 
78 S. Ct. 99.2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957))). 
B. The Plaintiffs claims against BIC are properly asserted in tort. 
BIC argues that all claims Plaintiff asserts against r20] it--fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, 
negligence and wantonness--arose from their contract and, thus, those claims "must be 
dismissed insofar as the allegations therein assert a cause of action sounding in tort but 
based on a contract." (Doc. 65 at 6.) The undersigned disagrees. 
It is well settled in Alabama that "a mere failure to perform a contractual obligation is not a tort." Barber v. Business 
Products Center, inc., 677 So. 2d 223.228 (Na. 1996)1. overruled on other grounds by White Sands Group, L.L.0 v. 
PRS Il, LLC. 32 So. 3d 5. 14 (Na. 2009)]. It is also true, however, that Alabama courts have recognized exceptions to 
this rule. See. e.g.. Powers v. CSX Transp.. Inc.. 190 F. Supp. 2d 1284. 1295 (S.D. Na. 2002) (collecting cases). The 
Eleventh Circuit has construed Alabama law on this point as providing that, while ordinary breach of contract does not 
constitute a tort. lilt is possible for a tort to arise in Alabama out of a breach of a duty implied by or arising out of a 
contract." Brown-Marx Associates. Ltd. v. Emigrant Say. Bank, 703 F.2d 1361. 1371 (11th Cir. 1983); see also Hamner
