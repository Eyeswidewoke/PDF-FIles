purchaser of such a Security by its purchasing and holding to represent. warrant and covenant that. for so long as it 
holds a beneficial interest in such Securities, it (and each account for which it is acquiring such Securities) is not a 
Benefit Plan Investor or, except with respect to ERISA Limited Securities purchased by a Controlling Person on the 
Closing Date, a Controlling Person.

Security will be restricted in order to comply with the aforementioned limitations. Moreover, there can be no 
assurance that. despite the restrictions relating to purchases by or transfers to Benefit Plan Investors and Controlling

ERISA Limited Securities will not be "significant."

purchase and to hold Securities should determine whether, under the general fiduciary standards of investment 
prudence and diversification and under the documents and instruments governing the Plan, an investment in such 
Securities is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the overall investment policy of the Plan and the 
composition of the Plan's investment portfolio. Any Plan proposing to invest in Securities should consult with its 
counsel to confirm that such investment will not result in a prohibited transaction and will satisfy the other 
requirements of ERISA and the Code. 
The sale of any Securities to a purchaser is in no respect a representation by any Transaction Party or any of its 
respective Affiliates that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by 
purchasers generally or any particular purchaser. or that such an investment is appropriate for purchasers generally 
or any particular purchaser.
