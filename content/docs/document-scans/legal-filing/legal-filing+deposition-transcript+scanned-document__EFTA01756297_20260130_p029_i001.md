<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.Opt">October 2013 -- Vis=tors to the Science Museum this autumn will 
catch a glimpse of a future in=which engineers can make lighter and more efficient parts for aircraft and=space probes, 
where patients will one 
day be able to mint their own drugs and doctors print replacement body org=ns.8mbsp;</span></P> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.Opt">The idea of 3D prin=ing is not new: it has been available 
commercially for around three decade=. Back in the 1990s, I speculated about the potential of 'printing' Ch=istmas 
presents. In 2004, I became aware 
of the potential of what was then called 'rapid prototyping' when I vi=ited the Renault Fl team works in 
Oxfordshire.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">What has changed in=recent years is that 3D printers are 
becoming cheaper, smarter, better and=more ubiquitous. When in May a self-proclaimed crypto-anarchist in Texas 
m=de a handgun using a f 5,000 30 printer, 
the international press cottoned on that something was changing in the wor=d of manufacturing.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.Opt">One object in parti=ular seems to sum up the potential of this 
technology: a mechanical hand d=signed and printed by Richard Van As, a South African carpenter, following=a circular 
saw accident in which he 
lost four fingers. Van As was able to collaborate with a British prop-make= over a distance of 10,000 miles to create the 
'Robohand' and has made=the plans freely available online so that anyone can use them. At the time=of writing, these 
have been downloaded 
more than 30,000 times.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:lS.Opt">The first industria= revolution reshaped society and boosted the 
incomes of the poor as manual=labour was displaced by machine-based manufacturing. Factories produced it=ms in 
their thousands, profiting from 
vast economies of scale. Now, thanks to the 3D printing revolution, bespok= craftsmanship is making a 
comeback.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.Opt">The formal label gi=en to this craft is 'additive manufacturing' —
the object is built u= layer by layer in a 3D printer. The traditional approach to manufacturing=is 'subtractive' and relies 
on milling, grinding 
and cutting to remove material, wasting much of it in the process.</span><=p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.Opt">Additive manufactur=ng is an organic blend of craft and hi-tech 
that is the opposite of the pr=duction line assembly methods pioneered by Henry Ford. It heralds a new wo=ld of 
consumer choice as almost anything 
can be customized and then printed — even the 3D printer itself.&nbsp;</=pan></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.Opt">One of the mileston=s in the field came when Adrian Bowyer, 
who was then at the University of =ath, devised RepRap, which stands for 'replicating rapid-prototyper', =hich works like 
a printer but, rather than 
squirting ink on to paper, lays down thin layers of molten biodegradable p=astic which solidify to make 
objects.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.Opt">This machine was th= first to copy all of its own 3D-printed parts, 
which could then be assemb=ed into a new RepRap machine. Now similar machines are available in kit fo=m, marking a 
dramatic rise in the use 
of this technology analogous to when the mainframe computer gave way to th= desktop PC.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:lS.Opt">Nimble start-up com=anies are now entering the market and 
being absorbed into industrial giant=. All the while, the software and other ingredients of 3D printers are get=ing 
cheaper, while hackers adapt and 
improve them. Hobbyists now play with them. Communal 3D printing facilitie= for local people are springing up in the 
United States.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.Opt">These 3D printers c=me in various kinds. Some spray 'inks', such 
as liquid polymers that s=lidify when exposed to ultra violet light. Others use layers of sticky pap=r, or extrude filaments 
of molten plastic. 
There are those that use powdered metal or plastic that is made solid with=a laser or an electron beam. As the 
technology mutates and evolves, the qu=lity of the objects they can make gets better.&nbsp;</span></p>
