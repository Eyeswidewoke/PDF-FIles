person approach to increase victims' willingness to participate in police interviews throughout 
the investigation and later to appear in the courtroom as a fact witness. 
Witness-centered Interviewing: In a typical police interview, the investigator controls the social 
dynamics, and structures the interview around his or her cognitive needs. For instance, 
interviewers interrupt witnesses' narrations frequently to ask follow-up questions, because 
interviewers are concerned that they will forget to ask the follow-up question—and they consider 
only secondarily, or not at all, that their interruptions disrupt the witness's thought processes. By 
comparison, in a CI, the victim plays a more central role: The victim's thoughts and emotions 
drive the interview process, and the interviewer alters his/her questions in response to the 
victim's recollections. We suspect that the victim's greater control over the interview process in 
the CI leads to a greater sense of self-efficacy than in the typical police interview, where the 
victim/witness plays a more subordinate role. 
A parallel phenomenon occurs when interviewing people whose first language is different from 
the interviewer's, e.g. an English-speaking police investigator interviewing a new immigrant 
whose first language is French, and who has difficulty expressing himself in English. In the CI, 
interviewers allow victims first to write out or tape record their story in their preferred language 
(here, French) and only after having expressed themselves in this comfortable modality does the 
interview proceed in the witness's non-preferred language (here, English). Allowing victims to 
express themselves first in their preferred language increases the likelihood that victims will 
generate more complete and accurate descriptions, and thereby raise victims' feelings of self-
efficacy and control. By comparison, forcing victims to describe events only in their non-
preferred language further increases victims' frustration. 
Heightened Concentration: The CI victim likely concentrates more intensely during the interview 
than does a conventional interview victim. That comes about for a variety of reasons: (a) CI 
interviewers ask fewer questions and are less likely to disrupt the victim's concentration; (b) the 
CI is conducted at a slower pace; (c) the CI victim is encouraged to close his/her eyes; (d) the CI 
encourages victims to provide long narrative responses, in which victims become increasingly 
focused as the narrative develops (cf. conventional interviews in which victims provide many 
brief answers). We believe that the resulting heightened concentration allows victims to be more 
relaxed during the interview, and that this confers a greater sense of control and mastery when 
thinking about the critical event. 
Trust Between Interviewer and Victim: In conventional police interviewers, victims often report 
that they feel like suspects when they are asked a string of very specific, closed questions at the 
outset of the interview. By comparison, when witnesses are permitted to give an open-ended 
narration at the beginning of a CI, they feel as if the interviewer trusts them, and actually listens 
to them. Not surprisingly, feeling like a trusted person rather than as a suspect should contribute 
to the victim's perception of dignity and respect. 
The aforementioned are the major differences between the CI and conventional police 
interviews. We suspect that there may be many other subtle components within the CI that 
contribute toward victims' well being, and conversely, that many components of the 
conventional interview contribute to its disruptive effects. It is interesting to note that some
