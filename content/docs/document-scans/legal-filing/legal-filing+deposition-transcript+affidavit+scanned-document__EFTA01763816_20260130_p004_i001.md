Oct 22, 2012 -- Rec=ntly, Iran's currency, the rial, dropped to historic new lows. By Octobe= 1, 2012, the 
currency had plummeted <http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/world/mid=leeast/irans-rial-plummets-against-the-
dollar.html?_r=2&hp&> =0 35,000 rials to the dollar — it had stood at 25,000 rials to the dolla= only a week earlier. Only 
a few days later, the currency dropped even further to 40,000 rials to the dollar. 
In response, protests erupted4=pan> <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east=19812482> outside 
Tehran's old and largest bazaar. The government closed currency =xchange shops and rounded up hundreds of illegal 
money changers, in the ho=es of curbing the rials' financial slide.=span style="font-size:18pt"> 
These events have c=ntributed to disruption and instability in the Iranian economy, which alre=dy suffers from 
high unemployment, low output, and soaring inflation. As reflected in the October 2012 World Economic Out=ook, 
prepared by the International Monetary Fund, the Iranian economy face= a number of challenges. According to the 
report, in the coming year, the =ranian economy is predicted to have growth of -0.9 percent, unemployment of over 14 
percent, and a wild i=flation rate of 25 percent. 
A combination of mi=management, bad economic planning, inadequate attention to the adverse imp=cts of 
international economic and financial sanctions, and the strained relationship between Iranian businesses and th= 
outside world has contributed to Iran's current economic woes. The situ=tion has been further aggravated by low 
tolerance within the Iranian gover=ment for constructive criticism, lack of interest in expert opinions, lack of flexibility in 
dealing with t=e outside world and a disinterest in looking to the experiences of other c=untries to find solutions to 
similar economic issues. p> 
Following the end o= the eight-year war with Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran focused on for=ulating and 
carrying out Five Year Development Plans (FYDPs). The 4th and 5th FYDPs, respectively launched in, 2005=06 and 
2011/12, were part of a 20-year economic and social vision that was=expected to improve the Iranian economy's 
international ranking.<=span> 
Unfortunately, howe=er, these plans contained many implausible targets and set largely unattai=able goals. 
While the 4th FYPD set a target of 8% growth in GOP, the actual average growth in GDP during this period w=s 5%. GDP 
performance has also been inadequate during the initial years of=the 5th FYDP. 
Similarly unrealist=c objectives for employment, inflation, liquidity, productivity, domestic =nd foreign 
investment, poverty reduction, oil exports, and research and development also remained unachieved during =hese 
periods. 
The government's =ubsidy reform program is a particularly salient case study in the failure =f Iranian economic 
planning. The reform aims at compensating households through cash handouts for energy price increase=. The 20-
month period for implementation of subsidy reforms, the 5th FYDP=92s cardinal reform package, was, however, 
unsatisfactory. Despite the ref=rm program's boldness, several shortfalls—e.g., cash compensation to everyone, both 
rich and poor, and disregard for the e=periences of other countries—contributed to a number of negative outcome=. 
Large cash compensation payment deficits intensified government de=endence on Central Bank resources. This 
accelerated already high levels of liquidity in the Iranian economy. This =n turn increased inflation, which was in fact to 
be redressed by the subsi=y reform program. 
The 4th and 5th FYD=s represent one third of Iran's 20-year economic vision cycle. In develo=ing the 5th FYPD, 
policy makers failed to learn from the outcomes of the 4th FYDP and based the remainder of the 20-year v=sion upon 
feeble, quivering pillars. 
These plans failed =o pay attention to the adverse effects of international economic and finan=ial sanctions, 
which unfavorably harmed the government's normal operations and adversely affected the Iranian busine=s
