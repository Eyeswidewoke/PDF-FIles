MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
Overview 
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of 
effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business 
combination with one or more businesses. We have not identified any business combination target and we have 
not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with ik.spe..ct to 
identifying any business combination target. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash 
from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, our capital stock. 
debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 
The issuance of additional shares of our stock in a business combination: 
• may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering; 
• may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to 
those afforded our common stock: 
• could cause a change of control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued. which 
may affect, among other things. our ability to use our net operating loss cany forwards, if any, and could 
result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 
• may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or 
voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and 
• may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and/or warrants. 
Similarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in: 
• default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are 
insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 
• acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest 
payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or 
reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
