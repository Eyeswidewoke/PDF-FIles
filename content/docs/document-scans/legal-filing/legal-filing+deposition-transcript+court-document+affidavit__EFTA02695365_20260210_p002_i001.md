1. The DIFC Court is a state-of-the-art common law court whose procedures are based on the English civil procedure 
rules (with the ability to grant summary judgment), and whose judges comprise very experienced former judges from 
the senior courts of (for example) England, Singapore and New Zealand; 
2. Judgments rendered by the DIFC Courts can be enforced in the onshore Dubai courts as Dubai court judgments and 
this has happened on numerous occasions; 
3. In contrast to many offshore courts, parties in the DIFC Court can be awarded the bulk of their legal and expert costs 
and expenses; 
4. Dubai is signatory to two conventions providing for the recognition and enforcement of court judgments in many 
countries in the MENA Region. These are: 
• 
the 1983 Convention on Judicial Co-operation between States of the Arab League (the "Riyadh Convention"), to 
which all of the Gulf Cooperation Council ("GCC") countries, as well as Iraq, Palestine, Sudan, Mauretania, Somalia, 
Tunisia, Jordan, Morocco, Libya, Algeria, Yemen and Syria are signatoryll]; and 
• 
the 1995 Protocol on the Enforcement of Judgments Letters Rogatory, and Judicial Notices issued by the Courts 
of the Member States of the Arab Gulf Co-operation Council (the "GCC Protocol"), to which all of the GCC countries are 
signatory. 
Why should this interest you? 
If your company conducts business in the above countries we encourage you to speak with us to discuss the significance 
and implications of this new legislation on your business and in particular, on your existing dispute resolution policies. 
We believe that this development may be particularly important for: 
* 
financial institutions with a presence in the MENA region, as the judges in the DIFC Courts have experience of 
handling complex cross-border financial disputes, and the power to grant summary judgment; 
• 
parties contracting with regional financial institutions; 
• 
businesses with a presence in the UAE and in the wider MENA region, which will need to review their standard 
and bespoke contracts in light of this development; and 
• 
clients with an existing business, or planning to do business, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia since this 
development may present an alternative option for dispute resolution in contracts involving the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia.

generally;
