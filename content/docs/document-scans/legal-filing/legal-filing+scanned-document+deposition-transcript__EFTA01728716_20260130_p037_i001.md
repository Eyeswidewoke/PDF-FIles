jured themselves. Although in some cases the recantation may be valid, it is most 
likely the result of blackmail, feelings of guilt about the offender being in prison, 
or shame over their behavior. 
Some victims in acquaintance-child-exploitation cases disclose incomplete and 
minimized information about the sexual activity. This creates significant prob-
lems for the investigation and prosecution of such cases. For instance when the 
investigator finally gets a victim to disclose the exploitation and abuse, the victim 
furnishes a version of his victimization that he or she swears is true. Subsequent 
investigation then uncovers additional victims, child pornography, or computer 
chat logs—directly conflicting with the first victim's story. A common example of 
this is that the victim admits the offender sucked his penis, but denies that he 
sucked the offender's penis. The execution of a search warrant then leads to the 
seizure of photographs of the victim sucking the offender's penis. Additional vic-
tims may also confirm this, but then lie when they vehemently deny that they did 
the same thing. 
The allegations of multiple victims often conflict with each other. Each victim 
tends to minimize their behavior and maximize the behavior of other victims or 
the offender. Some victims continue to deny the activity even when confronted 
with the pictures. Today investigators must be especially careful in computer cases 
where easily recovered chat logs, records of communication, and visual images 
may directly contradict the socially acceptable version of events that the victim is 
now giving. 
Understanding the Preferential Molester 
Preferential sex offenders may be "pillars of the community" and are often 
described as "nice guys." They almost always have a means of access to children 
(e.g., marriage, neighborhood, occupation). Determining their means of access 
helps identify potential victims. Investigation should always verify the credentials 
of those who attempt to justify their acts as part of some "professional" activity. It 
must be understood, however, that just because an offender is a doctor, clergy 
member, or therapist, for example, does not mean he could not also be a child 
molester. 
As previously stated, because the molestation of children is part of a long-
term persistent pattern of behavior, preferential child molesters are like human 
evidence machines. During their lifetime they leave behind a string of victims 
and collection of child pornography and erotica. The preferential child molester, 
therefore, can be thoroughly investigated and corroborative evidence easily found 
if investigators understand how to recognize him and how he operates—and if 
their departments give them the time and resources. 
Men sexually attracted to young adolescent boys are the most persistent and 
prolific child molesters known to the criminal-justice system. Depending on how 
one defines molestation, they can easily have dozens if not hundreds of victims in 
a lifetime. They usually begin their activity when they are teenagers themselves 
and continue throughout their lives as long as they are physically able. 
Many pedophiles spend their entire lives attempting to convince themselves 
and others that they are not evil sexual perverts, but good guys who love and 
nurture children. That is a major reason why they do such things as join organiza-
tions where they can help troubled children and volunteer to search for missing 
children. Because so many of them have successfully hidden their activities for so
