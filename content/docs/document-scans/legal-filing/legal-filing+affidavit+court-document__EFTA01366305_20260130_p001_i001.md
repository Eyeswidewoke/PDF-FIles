placement warrants will expire worthless. The private placement 
warrants will not be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the 
sponsor or its permitted transferees (except as described below under 
"Principal Stockholders—Transfers of Founder Shares and Private 
Placement Warrants"). If the private placement warrants are held by 
holders other than the sponsor or its permitted transferees. the private 
placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the 
holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being 
sold in this offering. Our sponsor. or their permitted transferees. has 
the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless 
basis.

Transfer restrictions on private 
placement wan-ants 
Proceeds to be held in trust account 
The private placement warrants (including the common stock 
issuablc upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be 
transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion 
of our initial business combination. 
The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross 
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in 
a Dust account. Of the $140.8 million in proceeds we will receive 
from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants 
described in this prospectus, or approximately 5161.658 million if the 
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, $135.0 
million ($10.00 per unit), or approximately $155.25 million ($10.00 
per unit) if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in 
full, will be deposited into a segregated mist account located in the 
United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company 
acting as trustee. and $1.75 million will be used to pay expenses in 
connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital 
following this offering. The trustee, upon our written instructions. 
will direct Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as Depositary 
(or such other depositary bank designated by us) to invest the funds 
as set forth in such written instructions and to custody the funds while 
invested and until otherwise instructed. The proceeds to be placed in 
the trust account include approximately up to $4,050,000 (or 
approximately up to $4,657,500 if the underwriters' over-allotment 
option is exercised in full) in deferred underwriting commissions. 
Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, our amended and 
restated certificate of incorporation, as discussed below and subject to 
the requirements of law and stock exchange rules, will provide that 
none of the funds held in the mist account will be released from the 
trust account until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial 
business combination and (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public 
shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination 
within 24 months from the closing of this offering. Based on current 
interest rates, we do not expect that interest earned on the trust 
account will be sufficient to pay taxes. The proceeds deposited in the 
trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors. if 
any. which could have priority over the claims of our public 
stockholders. 
Anticipated expenses and 
funding sources 
Unless and until we complete our initial business combination, no 
proceeds held in the trust account will be available for our use.
