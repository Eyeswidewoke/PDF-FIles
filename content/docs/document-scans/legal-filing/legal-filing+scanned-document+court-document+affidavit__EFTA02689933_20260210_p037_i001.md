Amalgamation, division or transfer of Compartments or Classes 
17.11 Under the same circumstances as provided under Section 17.6 of this General Section, the General 
Partner may decide to allocate the assets of any Compartment to those of another existing 
Compartment within the Company or to another undertaking for collective investment organised under 
the provisions the 2007 Act or of Part II of the 2002 Act or the 2010 Act or to another compartment 
within such other undertaking for collective investment (the new Compartment) and to redesignate 
the Shares of the Compartment concerned as Shares of another Compartment (following a split or 
consolidation, if necessary, and the payment of the amount corresponding to any fractional entitlement 
to the relevant Shareholders). Such decision will be notified in the same manner as described under 
Section 17.6 of this General Section one month before its effectiveness (and, in addition, the 
publication will contain information in relation to the new Compartment), in order to enable 
Shareholders to request redemption of their Shares, free of charge, during such period. 
17.12 Notwithstanding the powers conferred to the General Partner by Section 17.11 of this General Section, 
a contribution of the assets and liabilities attributable to any Compartment to another Compartment 
within the Company may, in any other circumstances, be decided upon by a General Meeting of the 
Compartment or Class concerned for which there will be no quorum requirements and which will 
decide upon such an amalgamation by resolution taken by simple majority of those present or 
represented and voting at such meeting. Such resolution will however be subject to the General 
Partner's consent. 
17.13 Furthermore, in other circumstances than those described in Section 17.6 of this General Section, a 
contribution of the assets and of the liabilities attributable to any Compartment to another undertaking 
for collective investment referred to in Section 17.11 of this General Section or to another 
compartment within such other undertaking for collective investment will require a resolution of the 
Shareholders of the Class or Compartment concerned taken with 50% quorum requirement of the 
Shares in issue and adopted at a 2/3 majority of the Shares present or represented and voting, except 
when such an amalgamation is to be implemented with a Luxembourg undertaking for collective 
investment of the contractual type (fonds commun de placement) or a foreign based undertaking for 
collective investment, in which case resolutions will be binding only on such Shareholders who have 
voted in favour of such amalgamation. Any General Meeting resolution taken in accordance with this 
Section 17.13 is subject to the General Partner's consent. 
18. 
DISTRIBUTION — RE-INVESTMENT CASH 
General 
18.1 
Each year the General Meeting will decide, based on a proposal from the General Partner, for each 
Compartment, on the use of the balance of the year's net income of the Investments. A dividend may be 
distributed, either in cash or Shares. Distributions may take place through the redemption of Shares. 
Further, dividends may include a capital distribution, provided that after distribution the net assets of 
the Company total more than EUR1,250,000. 
18.2 
Over and above the distributions mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the General Partner may 
determine to the payment of interim dividends (including, for the avoidance of doubt, through a 
redemption of Shares pursuant to Section 8.4 of this General Section) in the form and under the 
conditions as provided by law. Any such distribution will be made in compliance with the distribution 
scheme applicable to the relevant Compartment.
