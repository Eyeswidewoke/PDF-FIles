SOP III -1081 Southern Financial LIS 
received a payment from the Fund as of the time of such distribution or payment equal to 
the portion of such amount that is attributable to such Partner's Interest as determined by 
the General Partner in its sole discretion, which payment shall be deemed to be a 
distribution of Distributable Cash pursuant to the relevant clause of Section 6.2 to the 
extent that such Partner (or any successor to such Partner's Interest) would have received 
a cash distribution but for such withholding. To the extent that such payment exceeds the 
cash distribution that such Partner would have received but for such withholding, the 
General Partner shall notify such Partner as to the amount of such excess and such 
Partner shall make a prompt payment to the Fund of such amount by wire transfer, which 
payment shall not constitute a Loan and, consequently, shall not reduce the Remaining 
Commitment of such Partner or increase the balance of such Partner's Partner Account. 
In the event that the Fund anticipates receiving a distribution or payment from which tax 
will be withheld in kind, the General Partner may elect to prevent such in kind 
withholding by paying such tax in cash and may require each Partner in advance of such 
distribution to make a prompt payment to the Fund by wire transfer of the amount of such 
tax attributable to such Partner's Interest as equitably determined by the General Partner, 
which payment shall not constitute a Loan and, consequently, shall not reduce the 
Remaining Commitment of such Partner or increase the balance of such Partner's Partner 
Account. 
(e) 
FATCA. Each Partner shall provide the General Partner and the Fund 
with any information, representations, certificates or forms relating to such Partner (or its

Investment Vehicle holds (directly or indirectly) an interest (whether in the form of debt 
or equity), Many member of any "expanded affiliated group" (as defined in 
section 1471(e)(2) of the Code) of which any Person described in clause (i) or (ii) is a 
member and (iv) the Manager or any of its Affiliates) to (A) enter into, maintain or 
comply with the agreement contemplated by section 1471(b) of the Code, (B) satisfy any 
requirement imposed under sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code in order to avoid any 
withholding required under sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (including any 
withholding upon any payments to such Partner under this Agreement), (C) comply with 
any reporting or withholding requirements under sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code 
or (D) comply with any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted 
pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the 
implementation of sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code. In addition, each Partner 
shall take such actions as the General Partner may reasonably request in connection with 
the foregoing. In the event that any Partner fails to provide any of the information, 
representations, certificates or forms (or undertake any of the actions) required under this 
Section 6.9(e), the General Partner shall have full authority to (A) (x) form an entity
