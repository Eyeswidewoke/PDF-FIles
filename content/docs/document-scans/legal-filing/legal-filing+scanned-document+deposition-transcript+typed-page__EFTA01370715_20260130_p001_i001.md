Good afternoon Wayne, 
Below is a PEP and negative media escalation for your review. 
Details on client: 
Juan Carlos Mas (J.C.) is the son of Jorge Mas Canosa (deceased 1997), a Cuban-American immigrant who founded 
the Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF) and MasTeclnc. a publicly traded company (MTZ). J.C. was 
introduced to DB by Freddy Menjivar, an Investment Solutions Group (ISG) Officer with the private bank. Freddy 
worked with the client from 2010-2015 as his relationship manager at JP Morgan. 
CANF was founded as a non-profit organization by Mr. Canosa in Naples, Florida in 1981 to identify independent civil 
society leaders as agents of change and support their mission to restore and rebuild the Cuban society who had suffered 
for generations under a forceful dictatorship. Since its incorporation, CANF has helped shape U.S. policy toward Cuba 
in ways that help promote a democratic and just society in Cuba. The Carter administration believed that if not for Mr. 
Canosa, the U.S. might have ended the Cuban embargo. After the death of Mr. Canosa in 1997, his son Jorge Mas 
became the chair and J.C. became a director. 
Mr. Canosa founded MasTec, Inc. in 1994, a multinational infrastructure engineering and construction company in 
Coral Gables, Florida. It is the second largest Hispanic-owned company in the United States with over 20,000 
employees in North America, Jose Mas, J.C's brother, became CEO after his father passed (until present) and J.0 
served as president of MasTec International, a subsidiary of Mastec Inc, until he became the CEO of Neff Rental in 
2002. 
In 1988 the Mas family along with Jose Perez (a long-time family friend) founded MP Equipment. In 1989, the Mas 
family purchased Neff Machinery and merged with MP Equipment to create Neff Rental. The company provides high-
quality construction equipments. The company was one of the largest equipment rentals employing more than 1,000 
people in branches across the U.S. J.C. was the CEO of Neff Rentals from 2002 until 2007, when a NY based private 
equity form acquired Neff Rentals. 
After J.0 stepped down from Neff Rentals, J.0 was involved in various family business matters and worked on 
developing his own company, Synergy Equipment in 2012. J.C. is currently the Chairman of Synergy Equipment, a 
rapidly expanding heavy equipment rental company in Florida and the owner of Juan Carlos Mas Holdings. He is also 
an active civic & community leader serving on multiple boards and organizations, including as a director of the Mas 
Family Foundation, which provides scholarships to disadvantaged young students who demonstrate leadership skills 
and embrace the ideals of a free society. His annual income is $10MM and net worth is between $100-$500MM. 
Purpose of the relationshio/Details of transactions: 
The purpose of this relationship is to open a DB AG premium bank account to earn high yields on cash. There will be 
an initial contribution of $2MM into a new checking account that will be transferred into the premium account. There 
are no additional expected inflows or outflows. The source of the contribution is gains from the clients' JPM 
investment account. The client will also be opening a PB Brokerage account with an initial contribution of $5MM. 
Reason for escalation: 
During the due diligence process negative media was found and the senior has been identified as a PEP. 
PEP Details: 
Mr. Canosa (father) -Founder of the CANF, which received funding from the U.S. government as well as funded the 
campaigns of several politicians. He worked with both the Carter and Reagan administration on Cuban American 
policy and was named the chair of the advisory board of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting by President Reagan. He was 
regarded within the U.S. as an effective lobbyist on Cuban and anti-Castro political positions but was labeled a 
"counterrevolutionary" by the Cuban government.
