Special Report: EMFX Outlook 2018: Growth-led Revaluation 
CU 
The Colombian peso faces a challenging 
domestic and external scenario. In addition to the 
already familiar twin deficits on the fiscal and current 
accounts, the Colombian economy faces a low-
confidence environment as well as a challenging 
election ahead. Towards the end of 2017 growth has 
somewhat picked up and inflation has eased. In 2018 
growth is likely to somewhat strengthen yet the peso's 
volatility is very sensitive to changes in the risk 
perception of the Colombian economy. Therefore, the 
election-related headlines especially if connected to 
Colombia's fiscal accounts could very likely trigger a 
bout of COP weakness followed by outflows due to 
Banrep's 
dovish 
stance 
and 
the 
increasingly 
challenging fiscal scenario up ahead. 
3 Unlike the currencies mentioned above, ILS does 
not have any major fundamental pressure points, as 
growth is in reasonable shape and the current account 
is in surplus. However, valuation and positioning are 
major concerns, and drive our tactically bearish view on 
the currency at these levels. In trade-weighted terms, 
ILS is near its all-time strong levels, which has also 
pushed overvaluation to historical extremes (chart). On 
our DBeer and PPP metrics, ILS is around 10% 
overvalued, right at the top of the historical valuation 
range. There have been retracements from such 
stretched valuations in the past. Meanwhile, inflation 
remains low, which - combined with the strong 
currency - opens the door for Bol FX intervention to 
pick up. 
ILS is at historical extreme overvalued levels

INN. The best of the tailwind - structurally positive 
policy measures (GST, bank recap), policy easing, 
ratings upgrade, carry/vol - are already in the price, and 
will be hard pressed to drive further outperformance in 
2018. The equity markets remain rich; bond inflows are 
restricted by access via FPI quotas, and likely to be 
pressured by concerns over fiscal slippage; and RBI is 
unlikely to be able to ease further in this rate cycle. Any 
upside to oil prices could be particularly damaging to

the macro picture via trade gap, inflation and fiscal (in 
the event of excise duty cuts) channels. We see RBI as 
continuing with its asymmetric intervention bias, 
persisting on the bid in dollars with an eye to prevent 
overvaluation hurting growth. 
Another currency that would naturally fit in the camp of 
those more exposed to depreciation is the 
- on 
valuation and high inflation. However, it needs a 
category apart as an adjustment currency such as the 
EGP. We maintain the view that it will play the role of 
nominal anchor - especially for wage negotiation is O1 
- and that it will outperform forwards for a near 
double-digit margin (amid bouts of depreciation). 
We conclude our risk assessment with Ekl's election

We find it to be most binary for Brazil and Mexico in 
terms of changing economic policies, increasing 
uncertainty hurting the investment climate, and fiscal 
slippage. While Colombia's election may fail to set the 
country on a fiscally sustainable path, we expect 
moves in that direction in Brazil and Mexico. To repeat, 
however, these remain quite uncertain.
