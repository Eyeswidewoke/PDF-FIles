Long or short, Mark G. Roberts? 
The Head of Real Estate Strategy and Research looks at global sectoral trends. 
Are commercial real-estate fundamentals generally still 
attractive? 
ain Across the globe, we currently see a positive spread 
between long and short interest rates, implying that a recession 
- with its obvious negative implications for tenant demand and 
rents - is not likely. In addition, outside of a few markets, the 
amount of new construction remains low. As a result, vacancy 
rates are declining and rent levels are increasing, likely leading 
to higher earnings growth. We continue to favor a pro-cyclical 
investment strategytargeted at offices and logistics, areas which 
typically perform well as economic growth increases. 
But is caution advisable on specific markets? 
EZI In the United States, the decline in oil prices is expected to 
have knock-on effects for certain property sectors in Houston. 
In the United Kingdom, the regions are in an upwards market 
cycle and we prefer these markets over central London, where 
the increase in new construction against a background of higher 
base rates could lead to lower relative returns. Finally, pricing 
appears aggressive in Singapore and vacancy rates are expected 
to increase which could create downside risks for capital values. 
Would listed real estate be resilient to an abrupt rise in interest 
rates? 
Listed real estate may appear interestingly valued 
compared to the broader equity market or Treasury yields. U.S. 
RE ITs (real estate investment trusts) are also currently trading at 
a discount of around 2% to the underlying net asset value (NAV) 
of property held by these companies. (Over the long term, they 
typically trade at a 5% premium.) When stock valuations become 
disconnected like this from the private market, we typically see 
increased share buy-backs and higher levels of mergers-and-
acquisitions activity, providing a catalyst for prices to move 
higher. Still, we are mindful of the impact that a sudden upwards 
move in interest rates could have on the asset class. U.S. REITs 
would probably move on par with the S&P 500 Index if there was 
only a 25-basis-point rise in rates — but a larger unexpected rise 
would likely lead to underperforrnance

Will governments continue to support infrastructure investment? 
En Each dollar spent by governments on infrastructure can 
translate into much greater gains in GDP and employment.
However, budget constraints are limiting public investment, 
and governments have started putting greater emphasis on 
attracting private capital in infrastructure. We see this trend 
continuing, with governments "crowding in" private-sector 
Investment, through improving regulatory frameworks and 
public-private-partnership structures. This is likely to create 
further opportunities for institutional investors seeking 
long-dated, inflation-hedged income streams and portfolio 
diversification. 
Do you have a positive outlook for listed infrastructure? 
BM We recently completed a top-down analysis on listed 
infrastructure as well as real-estate securities and how they 
have performed in different economic environments, with a 
focus on GDP and interest-rate levels relative to their average. 
This suggests that, in the current environment, global listed 
infrastructure securities would perform broadly in line with the 
MSCI World Index for equities if there was a 25-basis-point 
rise in the major developed economies' interest rates. For the 
upcoming year, we expect global listed infrastructure securities 
to generate total returns in the range of 7%.
