changes involved in maintaining such licenses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. 
We are subject to risks related to litigation, including intellectual property claims and regulatory disputes. 
We may be, and in some instances have been, subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), 
government investigations, and other proceedings involving intellectual property, consumer protection, privacy, labor and 
employment, immigration, import and export practices, product labeling, competition, accessibility, securities, tax, marketing and 
communications practices, commercial disputes, and other matters. For example, we have been served with a putative class action 
complaint filed on behalf of couriers for our Caviar subsidiary alleging that the couriers have been improperly denied reimbursement 
for business expenses due to their classification as independent contractors. 
We are currently in litigation with Robert E. Morley and a related entity regarding the inventorship of certain patents related 
to our intellectual property (Morley Litigation). If one or more claims in the Morley Litigation were determined adversely to us, or if 
the Morley Litigation were settled on unfavorable terms, this could affect our ability to use certain intellectual property and could 
also result in substantial monetary liabilities. In addition, Mr. Morley filed a subsequent lawsuit containing allegations that the 
formation of Square and the development of our card reader and decoding technologies constituted, among other things, breach of 
an alleged oral joint venture, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation of trade 
secrets, as well as other related claims. Mr. Morley contends that he was an equal partner with Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey in 
the business enterprise that ultimately evolved into Square, and that Mr. Dorsey and Mr. McKelvey breached their alleged oral joint 
venture agreement with Mr. Morley by excluding him from ownership in Square. Mr. Morley is seeking a judgment and order that 
Square, Mr. Dorsey, and Mr. McKelvey hold ownership of Square in constructive trust for Mr. Morley, as well as a variety of 
damages, injunctive relief, royalties, and correction of inventorship of certain of our patents. 
The number and significance of our legal disputes and inquiries have increased as we have grown larger, as our business 
has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and as our products and services have increased in complexity.

Becoming a public company will raise our public profile, which may result in increased litigation. In addition, some of the laws and 
regulations affecting the intemet, mobile commerce, payment processing, business financing, and employment did not anticipate 
businesses like ours, and many of the laws and regulations affecting us have been enacted relatively recently. As a result, there is 
substantial uncertainty regarding the scope and application of many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, which 
increases the risk that we will be subject to claims alleging violations of those laws and regulations. In the future, we may also be 
accused of having, or be found to have, infringed or violated third-party intellectual property rights. 
Regardless of the outcome, legal proceedings can have a material and adverse impact on us due to their costs, diversion of 
our resources, and other factors. Plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the 
course of litigation, including preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle 
legal disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Furthermore, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we 
may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that we may not choose to appeal or that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may 
have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights. If we are required, or choose to enter 
into, royalty or licensing arrangements, such arrangements may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly 
increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop or procure alternative non-infringing 
technology or discontinue use of technology, and doing so could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible. In 
addition, the terms of any settlement or judgment in connection with any legal claims, lawsuits, or proceedings may require us to 
cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party and could materially and adversely affect our 
business. 
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, 
services, and brand. 
Our trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are critical to our success. We rely 
on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination of confidentiality, invention assignment, and license agreements with our 
employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, trade dress, domain name, 
copyright, trade secret, and patent rights, to protect our brand and other intellectual property rights. However, various events 
outside of our control may pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. as well as to our products and services. Effective 
protection of trademarks, copyrights, domain names, patent rights, and other intellectual property rights is expensive and difficult to
