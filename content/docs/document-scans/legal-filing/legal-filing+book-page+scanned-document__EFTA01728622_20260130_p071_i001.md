it appear to be homemade child pornography. If necessary, highly experienced 
investigators and forensic laboratories could be of assistance in making 
distinctions between homemade and commercially produced child pornography. 
Contrary to what its name implies, the quality of homemade child pornogra-
phy can be as good if not better than the quality of any commercial pornography. 
The pedophile has a personal interest in the product. Homemade simply means it 
was not originally produced 'primarily for commercial sale. Although.commercial 
child pornography is not openly sold in "brick and mortar" stores anywhere in 
this country, homemade child pornography is continually produced, swapped, 
and traded in almost every community in the United States primarily via the 
Internet. Although rarely found in "adult" bookstores, child pornography is 
frequently found in the homes and offices, especially on the computers, of 
doctors, lawyers, teachers, clergy members, and other apparent pillars of the com-
munity. There is, however, a connection between commercial and homemade 
child pornography. Sometimes homemade child pornography is sold or winds 
up in commercial child-pornography magazines, movies, and videos or uploaded 
on the Internet. The same pictures are reproduced and circulated again and again. 
With rapidly increasing frequency, more and more of both commercial and home-
made child pornography is found in digital format on computers and disks. In 
this format there is no loss of quality when it is reproduced. This actually 
increases the odds of finding child pornography in any investigation. Again the 
Internet has tended to blur the distinction between commercial and homemade 
child pornography. 
Technical Versus Simulated 
In understanding the nature of child pornography, investigators must also 
recognize the distinction between technical and simulated child pornography. 
As previously stated the federal child-pornography law (18 U.S.C.A. § 2256) 
defines a child as anyone younger than the age of 18; therefore, a sexually explicit 
photograph of a pubescent, mature looking 15-, 16-, or 17-year-old girl or boy is 
what I call technical child pornography. Technical child pornography does not 
look like child pornography, but it is. The production; distribution; and, in some 
cases, possession of this child pornography could and should be investigated 
under appropriate child-pornography statutes. Technical child pornography is 
an exception to much of what we say about child pornography. It often is pro-
duced, distributed, and consumed by individuals who are not child molesters or 
pedophiles; is more openly sold in stores and distributed around the United States; 
and more often portrays females than males. In essence, because it looks like 
adult pornography, it is more like adult pornography. 
On the other hand, sexually explicit photographs of 18-year-old or older males 
or females may not legally be child pornography, but, if the person portrayed in 
such material is young looking, dressed youthfully, or made up to look young, 
the material could be of interest to pedophiles. This is what I call simulated child 
pornography. Simulated child pornography looks like child pornography, but 
may not be. (See discussion below.) It is designed to appeal to the pedophile but it 
usually is not legally child pornography because the individuals portrayed are 
older than 18. This illustrates the importance and sometimes the difficulty in 
proving the age of the child in the photographs or videotapes. Particularly 
difficult is pornography portraying underage children pretending to be overage
