Russia, Iran, and China, attempting to influence the 2024 U.S. election. According to the article, Smith referenced

Opinion: Why the Secrecy Around the Foreign Source of the Springfield Hoax Bomb Threats? 
An opinion piece from the National Review (09/18, Geraghty) reported that Ohio Governor Mike DeWine's office 
has not disclosed the foreign source behind a series of bomb threat hoaxes targeting Springfield schools, aiming to 
prevent further threats. According to the article, the FBI has publicly warned that Russia, China, and Iran seek to 
influence the 2024 election by sowing discord, which aligns with the motives behind these threats. The article 
noted that the Intelligence Community views Russia as the leading foreign influence actor, with Iran increasing 
efforts and China focusing on down-ballot races. The author assessed that the government's lack of transparency 
raises concerns about its handling of foreign threats and national security.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Veteran CIA Officer Who Drugged and Sexually Assaulted Dozens of Women Gets 30 Years in Prison 
The Associated Press (09/18, Mustian, Goodman) reported that a longtime CIA officer who drugged, photographed 
and sexually assaulted more than two dozen women in postings around the world was sentenced to 30 years in 
federal prison Wednesday after an emotional hearing in which victims described being deceived by a man who 
appeared kind, educated and part of an agency "that is supposed to protect the world from evil." According to the 
article, Brian Jeffrey Raymond, with a graying beard and orange prison jumpsuit, sat dejectedly as he heard his 
punishment for one of the most egregious misconduct cases in the CIA's history. It was chronicled in his own library 
of more than 500 images that showed him in some cases straddling and groping his nude, unconscious 
victims. Prosecutors say the 48-year-old Raymond's assaults date to 2006 and tracked his career in Mexico, Peru, 
and other countries, all following a similar pattern. A DOJ press release quoted FBI Assistant Director in Charge 
David Sundberg of the Washington Field Office, who said, "For 14 years, Raymond exploited his trusted position as 
a U.S. government representative to lure women into his confidence, he then drugged and sexually assaulted them 
and took explicit photos and videos of them without their consent. The FBI thanks the brave women who shared 
information that furthered this investigation. We recognize our domestic and foreign law enforcement partners 
who helped bring Raymond to justice for his reprehensible crimes?' Fox News (09/18, Casiano), Washington 
Post (09/18, Hsu), and Newsweek (09/18, Venegas) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: FBI Investigates Suspicious Packages Sent to Election Officials in Mukiple States 
The New York Post (09/18, King) reported that election officials in more than a dozen states have received 
suspicious packages in recent days, triggering security fears less than seven weeks before millions of Americans go 
to the polls to elect the next president and Congress. Several state election offices, including in Kansas and Iowa, 
were briefly evacuated after receiving the parcels, which have not been found to contain hazardous material. The 
article quoted spokespeople for the US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) and FBI, who said, "Some of the letters 
contained an unknown substance and we are working closely with our law enforcement partners to respond to 
each incident and safely collect the letters, we are also working with our partners to determine how many letters 
were sent, the individual or individuals responsible for the letters, and the motive behind the letters." In at least 
one case, the sender of a package was listed as the "United States Traitor Elimination Army?' Many of the bundles 
contained a white, powdery substance, according to local officials. USA TODAY (09/18, Gomez), the Guardian 
(09/18, Tait), and CBS News (09/18, Video) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: Trump Assassination Attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania 
The Secret Service's Failure to Halt a Tragedy at a Trump Rally 
The New York Times (09/18, Sullivan, Kelly) reported that several lapses are emerging as key reasons the U.S. Secret 
Service failed to protect former President Donald J. Trump from an assassination attempt at a campaign rally on 
July 13 in Butler, Pa., a New York Times investigation has found. According to the article, the agency's failures at the 
Butler Farm Show grounds — where a gunman's bullets grazed Trump's ear, wounded two rally attendees and killed
