SRLP102 Alpha Group Capital 
A broad range of risk factors could cause the Skis Funds to fail to meet their investment objectives, 
and there can be no assurance that the Siris Funds will achieve these objectives. Additionally, the 
Projections in many cases may not reflect the value obtainable in a sale of such investments under 
current market conditions. If the Skis Funds or Siris Capital were to liquidate such investments 
under current market conditions, the values obtained may, with respect to certain investments, be 
materially lower than those indicated in the Projections, as the Projections generally assume the 
successful implementation of Siris Funds' business plans at the time of disposition, which may, 
among other factors, include an improvement in current market conditions.
