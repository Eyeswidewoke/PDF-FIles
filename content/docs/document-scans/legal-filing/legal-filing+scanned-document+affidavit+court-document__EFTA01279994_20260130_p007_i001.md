Lender may require Borrower to pay a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or 
reporting service used by Lender in connection with this Loan. 
5. 
Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on 
the Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage," and 
any other hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires 
insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the 
periods that Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change 
during the term of the Loan. The insurance carrier providing the insurance shall be chosen by 
Borrower subject to Lender's right to disapprove Borrower's choice, which right shall not be 
exercised unreasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in connection with this Loan, either: 
(a) a one-time charge for flood zone determination, certification and tracking services: or (b) a 
one-time charge for flood zone determination and certification services and subsequent charges each 
time remappings or similar changes occur which reasonably might affect such determination or 
certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone determination 
resulting from an objection by Borrower. 
If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance 
coverage, at Lender's option and Borrower's expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any 
particular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or 
might not protect Borrower, Borrower's equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, 
against any risk, hazard or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously 
in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might 
significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed 
by Lender under this Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security 
Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and 
shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment. 
All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender's 
right to disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as 
mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and 
renewal certificates. If Lender requires, Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid 
premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise 
required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy shall include a 
standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee. 
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender 
may make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise 
agree in writing, any insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by 
Lender, shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is 
economically feasible and Lender's security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration 
period. Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an 
opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction, 
provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the 
repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is 
completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on
