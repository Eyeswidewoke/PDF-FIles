USA Today (7/23, Brown, 10.31M) reports, "Instacart said it has not found evidence of a 
cybersecurity breach after customers' private data was reportedly unearthed on the dark web." 
Instacart responded to a Buzzfeed News story on the possible data breach Wednesday. 
"BuzzFeed says it confirmed with two Instacart users that the info included in the cache 
matched their recent purchases," but "Instacart told USA TODAY on Thursday that it initiated an 
investigation and found no evidence that its hub of user data has been breached." 
UK Universities Lose Data To Ransomware Attack. 
BBC News Online (UK) (7/23, 1.02M) reports at least six universities "in the UK and Canada 
have had student data stolen after hackers attacked a cloud computing provider." Human Rights 
Watch and the children's mental health charity, Young Minds, "have also confirmed they were 
affected." The hack targeted Blackbaud, "one of the world's largest providers of education 
administration, fundraising, and financial management software." The US-based company's 
systems "were hacked in May." It has been criticized "for not disclosing this externally until July 
and for having paid the hackers an undisclosed ransom." 
5G Spectrum Issues On Senate Agenda. 
Politico (7/23, Levine, 4.29M) reports in its Morning Tech column that wireless spectrum will 
take "center stage across a number of fronts today." The Senate Commerce telecom 
subcommittee today "will hear from a slate of industry and analyst witnesses about how the 
FCC and Administration have managed the airwaves in the wake of a series of high-profile SG 
spats." Tom Power, general counsel for wireless trade group CTIA, "plans to warn of global 
implications surrounding limited availability of prime mid-band spectrum." Power will testify, 
"Other nations are beating us to the punch." He'll recommend "the lower 3 MHz band, currently 
held by the Pentagon, as the next best target." 
A TikTok Ban In The US May Depend On Who Owns It. 
NPR (7/23, Allyn, 3.12M) reports TikTok is "contemplating ways to distance itself from its 
Chinese parent company as threats from Washington grow louder." The Trump Administration is 
"considering ways to push the video-sharing app, beloved by teens and 20-somethings, out of 
the US altogether." Leading technology policy and national security experts "say, if President 
Trump is determined to run TikTok out of the US, he is most likely to issue an executive order 
declaring it a national security threat under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 
an authority that branched out from the century-old Trading with the Enemy Act." Stewart 
Baker, the former general counsel at NSA, said, "When we talk about sanctions against Russian 
oligarchs and kleptocrats, well, the sanctions are that no American can do business with them. 
And now that same sanction might be used against TikTok." There are "murmurs about a 
possible American-based spinoff, or a small group of US investors buying the app." 
LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES 
FBI Data Show Increase In Blocked Gun Sales. 
Politico (7/23, Swan, 4.29M) reports, "Internal FBI data reveal a jarring new stat: The number 
of people trying to buy guns who can't legally own them has skyrocketed. That came as part of 
a surge in gun purchases in the first three months of 2020, compared to the same time period 
in 2019. And the change has raised concerns about gun safety." Politico adds, "In March 2019, 
the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) ran background checks on 
823,273 attempted gun buys (the system immediately greenlights the vast majority of 
transactions). This past March, however, NICS processed more than 1.4 million background 
checks--a massive spike. The most dramatic shift, though, might be in how many people the 
system blocked from buying guns. In March 2019 and February 2020, the NICS system blocked
