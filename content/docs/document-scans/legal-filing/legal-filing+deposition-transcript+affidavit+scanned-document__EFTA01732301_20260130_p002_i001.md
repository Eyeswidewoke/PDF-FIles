"Whoever succeeded in killing, this=is a big thing, and whoever [was killed but] succeeded in at least scaring=the Israeli 
pedestrian is also a Martyr." 
[Offic=al PA N, Oct. 31, 2015]

According to Zaki, all those who attacked Israelis are "giants,"="leaders," and "pioneers" and those who died attacking 
Israelis are "Marty=s." Although terrorist Raed Jaradat did not "succeed" in killing anyone, b=t "only" stabbed and 
critically wounded an Israeli soldier, Zaki singled h=m out, stating that he is "just like" the murderers, i.e., just as 
honorab=e. Zaki exemplifies the PA policy Pal=stinian Media Watch <http://www.palwatc=.org> has documented of 
turning =errorists into role models and heroes for society, stating=that this stabber surely will have something named 
after him: 
"I believe that, Allah willing, som=thing will be built and named after him [Raed]. When Palestine is liberate=, Allah 
willing, he will have at least an institution named after him, and=a statue [made] of him." (see longer excerpt below) 
Zaki made these statements during a special broadca=t on official PAN covering the transfer of the=bodies of two 
terrorist stabbers, Raed Jaradat and Mahmoud Ghanimat. 
See PA glorification of terrorists <http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=3D448> and PMW's docume=tation of the 
current terror wave <http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=3D1095> . 
The following is a longer excerpt of Zaki's glorification =1 murderers: 
Member of Fatah Central Committee= Abbas Zaki: "They =the Martyrs] are giants and leaders who have written the 
future of the reg=on. These Martyrs of the Al-Aqsa [Mosque] have outshined the political lea=ership and scared Israel... 
Raed (i.e., terrorist who stabbed one) is not =just] a Martyr from [the town of] Sall., or the Hebron district. Raed is j=st 
like lyad Al-Awawdeh (i.e., terrorist who stabbed one), Alaa Abu Jamal =i.e., terrorist who murdered two), and 
Muhannad Halabi (i.e., terrorist wh= murdered two). These are pioneers. Raed is one of the greatest pioneers..= I 
believe that, Allah willing, something will be built and named after hi= [Raed]. When Palestine is liberated, Allah willing, 
he will have at least=an institution named after him, and a statue [made] of him... Everyone who=loves Palestine and 
wants Israel to be scared, should salute [all] the dec=ased - whether they were Martyrdom-seekers, or Martyrs. 
Whoever succeeded =n killing, this is a big thing, and whoever succeeded in at least scaring =he Israeli pedestrian is also 
a Martyr."
