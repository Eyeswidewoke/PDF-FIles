Funds' or third-party valuation models. Market disruptions may also force a Multi-Strat 
Fund to close out one or more positions. Such disruptions have in the past resulted in 
substantial losses for funds employing relative value strategies. Even if a Multi-Strat 
Fund's relative value investment strategies are successful, they may result in high 
portfolio turnover, and, consequently, high transaction costs. 
A major component of relative value trading involves spreads between two or more 
positions. To the extent the price relationships between such positions remain constant, 
no gain or loss may occur. Such positions do, however, entail a substantial risk that the 
price differential could change unfavorably and, due to the leveraged nature of the Multi-
Strat Funds' trading, result in increased losses. 
Changes in the shape of the yield curve can cause significant changes in the profitability 
of relative value strategies. In the event of an inversion of the yield curve, the reversal of 
the interest differential between investments of different maturities can make previously 
profitable hedging techniques unprofitable. 
Market Neutral and Hedged Strategies 
Although Hudson Bay Capital invests in positions that are intended to be market neutral, 
it may be unable to, or decide not to, hedge its positions, and, in such event, a Multi-Strat 
Fund might sustain a significant risk of loss as a result of changes in the price of unhedged 
positions. In addition, there is no guarantee that the returns of the Multi-Strat Fund will 
continue to have a low correlation or be non-correlated with market indices and the Multi-
Sint Fund could experience significant losses. 
The Multi-Strat Funds also may utilize financial instruments such as commodity interests, 
forward contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and floors both for investment purposes 
and to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of the Multi-Strat Funds' 
portfolio positions. Hedging against a decline in the value of a portfolio position does not 
eliminate fluctuations in the values of portfolio positions or prevent losses if the values of 
such positions decline, but establishes other positions designed to gain from those same 
developments, thus moderating the decline in the portfolio positions' value. Such hedge 
transactions also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the portfolio positions 
should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible for the Multi-Strat Funds to enter into 
a hedging transaction at an acceptable price or at a price sufficient to protect the Multi-
Swat Funds from the anticipated decline in value of the portfolio position. 
Event-Driven Investing 
Event-driven strategies focus on investing in positions whose profitability depends upon 
the result of some significant corporate event occurring. The consummation of mergers, 
exchange offers, cash tender offers or other similar transactions can be prevented or 
delayed by a variety of factors. If the proposed transaction appears likely not to be 
consummated or in fact is not consummated or is delayed, the market price of the security 
to be tendered or exchanged may, and likely will, decline sharply by an amount greater 
than the difference between the Multi-Strat Fund's purchase price and the anticipated
