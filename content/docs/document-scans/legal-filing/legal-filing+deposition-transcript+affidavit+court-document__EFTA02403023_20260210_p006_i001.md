as coinciding at a single value of (xi, t). Suppose also we want to use a Lorentz transformation to 
derive the trajectories of those particles as seen by a second intertial observer. Then it is easy to 
construct cases in which the four particles no longer coincide in the second frame of reference, be-
cause the modified Lorentz transformation takes the positions coincident in one frame to different 
locations, depending on the energy and momentum of the particles. 
This certainly sounds bad, as it means an interaction that looks local to one observer involves 
four separated events in another observer's description. However, we have argued that the clas-
sical picture of DS R may not be self-consistent, so this puzzle should be re-examined in the quan-
tum theory. To see why quantum effects may help to resolve these apparent paradoxes, note that 
the commutation relation (4) imply additional uncertainty relations[16, 17, 18, 19], 
&tax ≥ tplxi 
(5) 
This implies immediately that we cannot construct a quantum state in which we can precisely 
localize a single particle both in x' and t. So the first observer cannot actually be sure that the 
four worldlines coincided at a single event. All observers must describe the possible interactions 
amongst the particles in terms of quantum probability amplitudes. Indeed, as is discussed by sev-
eral authors(16, 17, 18, 19, 6, 23], this additional uncertainty gives rise to an anomalous spreading 
of wavepackets due to the modified commutations relations (5). We reproduce this below, and in-
vestigate the extent to which this may provide a solution to the problem of non-locality generated 
by energy and momentum dependent Lorentz transformations. 
However, we are not able to demonstrate that the spreading of the wavepacket is sufficient to 
hide the non-locality generated by the Lorentz transformation for all states. Thus, we next inves-
tigate another approach to the issue. This is whether there might be a relaxation of the notion of 
locality which can incorporate the Lorentz dependence of the notion of a localized event, without 
at the same time leading to non-locality being so generic that it blatently disagrees with known 
physics. Thus, in section 5 we introduce a notion of n-locality in the context of the classical free 
relativistic particles, which is defined as follows: A set of N ≥ 3 events, E', each on a worldline 4 of 
a free relativistic particle, are n-local if there is an (energy and momentum dependent) Lorentz transforma-
tion which takes the N events to a single event 13°'. We can then hypothesize that interactions among 
particles propagating in n-Minkowski spacetime are n-local rather than locals. We can call N ≥ 3 
worldlines that contain mutually n-local events, n-intersecting. 
This will be acceptable only if generic sets of N ≥ 3 worldlines do not contain any mutually 
n-local events. Equivalently, it should not be the case that N ≥ 3 sets of worldlines can be brought 
to intersect by an energy and momentum dependent Lorentz tranformation. For were this pos-
sible, the principle that physics is n-local would imply that any set of N ≥ 3 particles could be 
interacting. Were this the case the notion that physics is local would be entirely lost. 
Happily, we show that this catastrophe does not occur. In section 5 we find that n-locality is not 
a generic property of any set of three or more worldlines. To the contrary, the sets of n-intersecting 
triples of worldlines are of measure zero in the sets of three worldlines, and become even rarer 
as four or more particles are involved. To investigate whether physics was n-local rather than 
Note that we restrict consideration to 3 or more particles, because if there is a real interaction amongst two par-
ticles, either they exchange energy and momentum, in which case the outgoing worldlines have different energy and 
momentum than the incoming ones, or they annihilate into a third particle. Coincidences of two particles that do not 
change either's energy and momentum are not physical interactions.
