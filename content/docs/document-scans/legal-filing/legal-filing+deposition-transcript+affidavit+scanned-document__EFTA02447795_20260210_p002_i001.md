Things did not go as planned. While Fitbit has =eleased a new line of fitness trackers and software, Jawbone's =ebsite 
says the products it released last year are out of stock. The =ompany has sold merchandise to a third party reseller. On 
Amazon, its =itness bands are steeply discounted. Its Up3 tracker for instance, is =eing sold for around $55, compared to 
the $179 it sold when it came out = little over a year ago. It does not have a single product planned for =he holidays this 
year. 
Mr. Rahman =aid discounting of products was common, reflecting the "nature =f online products and commerce." He 
added that Jawbone had =roducts in development that were close to launch. 
Lawsuit =oss 
Meanwhile, Jawbone lost a patent =nfringement and trade-secret violation lawsuit against Fitbit at the =.S. International 
Trade Commission in two separate rulings, though =awbone says it is appealing. Mr. Rahman referred to the trade 
secrets =uling as "narrow" and added that Jawbone's =atent portfolio remained strong. (A spokesman noted Jawbone 
still has a =ase against Fitbit pending in state court in California.) 
A BlackRock fund holding $216 million of the debt wrote =t down by 77%, while other Blackrock funds holding about $49 
million of =he debt wrote it down by 61%. 
Mr. Rahman =tood by the decision to sue. "We have a fiduciary obligation to =rotect our assets," Mr. Rahman said. 
BlackRock was one of the investors that believed 
Rahman could right the ship, leave its troubles behind and forge 
=head as a leader in consumer electronics. It loaned the $300 million to =awbone with plenty of protections, including at 
that time the right to =e paid back before any other investor. 
But =elations between the firms have become tense. In the email to staff, =r. Rahman noted "I believe everyone knows 
one of our larger =onstituents has been pushing for us to sell Jawbone," he said. =E2 They continue to fight against the 
company and the rest of our =hareholders. We do not understand their motivation," he wrote. =e didn't name the firm 
but a Jawbone spokesman confirmed he was =eferring to BlackRock. 
In =ednesday's interview, however, Mr. Rahman said: "We =99re working with BlackRock. It's not accurate to say we 
have a =isagreement." 
At =lackRock's request, Jawbone retained boutique investment bank =JT Partners and Code Advisers to look for buyers. 
A person familiar =ith the situation said Jawbone conducted the formal search in August. A =pokesman for Jawbone and 
Mr. Rahman wrote in an email that there were =o offers at the end of the process. 
Through a =pokesman, Mr. Rahman said "there had been some discussion"=about selling some of Jawbone's technology 
separately. "B=t those were very specific and limited discussions and never amounted =o an offer—none of our 
constituents were interested in this, =9D the spokesman wrote. 
A =lackRock fund holding $216 million of the debt wrote it down by 77%, =hile other BlackRock funds holding about $49 
million of the debt wrote =t down by 61%, according to securities filings. The writedowns seem to =ndicate the 
BlackRock funds don't expect to recover most of the =oney. "I don't know how they value things or don'= value things," 
Mr. Rahman said. 
Mr. Rahman said he would eventually explain to the =ublic what happened inside Jawbone over the past year, but not at 
this =ime. "We're going to do it on our terms," he =aid.
