learn from past mistakes will we find better direction. And because the ISIS crisis has to do with the relationship 
between religio=, politics, and violence, our response must have a religious component as wel=. Here is what we must 
keep in mind: 
1. The=e are no "holy wars." War is always the resu=t of a failure to resolve human conflicts without violence. War is a 
consequence of our=sins. Even when theology is used to justify the use of force, or "just war," <=i>it is still a failed 
response. There is no glory or righteousness in war. And those who argue for the use of force should be repentant and 
humble when they do =o. Since Bill O'Reilly is asking us to press our American government to fight against a "holy war" -
- we should reach back to O'Reilly to help him understan= why this rhetoric is so wrong and dangerous. 
2. We must admit that our primarily military response to terrorism since 9/11 has=not worked; it has made things 
worse. The world and our lives a=e less secure now because of previously failed military responses. In particular, the 
war in Iraq, based on false pretenses and carried out in wrong ways, is a primary cause of ISIS. The Iraq war destabilized 
that country and the region, refue=ed the Sunni/Shia sectarian conflict (just as many people in the international religious 
community warned), and revealed American practices and policies l=ke torture and supporting oppressive regimes -- all 
of which have accelerated =eep grievances that are at the core of the ISIS ideology. We cannot just keep d=ing what has 
failed. Protecting people from murderous assaults is a legitimate and necessary task that will require a serious strategy. 
But a primarily American military strategy cannot defeat ISIS, and even if an overwhelming American force were to enter 
Iraq and Syria to destroy the present ISIS arm=, they or something like them would rise up again. American forces 
perm=nently occupying the Middle East is not a sustainable strategy for peace but a formula for endle=s worldwide 
terrorism. 
3. Onl= new political and economic solutions in the Middle East will finally transf=rm the current state of affairs. While 
some, including Fox New= hosts like O'Reilly, continually disparage "political solutions," it is an obvious piece of the 
puzzle. A lasting soluti=n will require the often-divided Middle East states themselves to take responsibility for their own 
region and for their own failures of governanc= -- together. The United States must only assist them if they take 
responsibili=y for reasonable governance. We must be honest that the injustice and corruption of autocratic states in 
Muslim countries is a direct cause of ISIS, and our uncritical support for these governments must change. Beheadings in 
Saudi Arabia must be opposed as much as ISIS beheadings. Our Saudi hy=ocrisies, along with other Arab regimes, exist 
because of our thirst and addiction to oil and are part of w=at leads to an ISIS. Theologically, sin does beget sin, and 
accountability is necessary to a more peaceful future. 
4. Fundamentalism, in all our faith traditions, is a politicized use of religi=n based on fear and power, and it is best 
defeated from the inside, not the outside. Fundamentalism cannot be bombed away from without, which just gives 
them new recruits. Reli=ious fundamentalism is best defeated from within its own tradition. A global alliance between 
as many leaders and communities as possible, must be built to support responsible and courageous Muslim leaders 
whose teaching and practice must ultimately undermine the le=hal ISIS fundamentalism.
