respective responses to the significant events of history that decides the progress of mankind; there, it is 
the complex nature of man that assumes more importance than any underlying truth in history or 
science. Consequently, in search of answers for any metaphysical or ontological query it is more 
reasonable to find ways of exploring man first; may be it should be as a whole by appropriate means than 
by limiting the investigation only to what humans or other species are found to be physically or 
biologically constituted of.

Reality Has Its Own Purpose In and For Itself

In a recent article by Deepak Chopra, MD, "Can We Evolve Beyond Evolution? We Have To" [1J it was 
mentioned that 
"-- The reality we accept is a human construct." 
"— We should see ourselves as conscious creators who imbue reality with our own purposes." 
While many people think this way there are also those who believe reality is fixed in stone beyond 
whatever they may think of it. To some extent both are right. We do have the freedom to interpret what 
we experience, and mind does play a role in determining what the senses observe. At the same time 
reality doesn't just disappear when we do not perceive it. Our house is still there when we go to work for 
several hours. For instance, it could bum down when we are not there. So it is not all a human construct, 
and as for purposes they also are not solely created by us. 
A more satisfactory conception would be one that includes and harmonizes both the idealism of a mind 
or consciousness based creation of reality, and the realism of the inherent purposefulness of an already 
existing reality of which we are part and parcel. 
The reality people experience is a human construct insofar as it is limited to sensuous perception of the 
phenomenal world of appearance, as well as the circumscribed judgments of finite understanding. 
However, this does not reach to the noumenal Reality in and for itself beyond or behind its apparent or 
phenomenal surface. In India the mayavad philosophy of Brahman Satyam, Jagat Mithya claims that 
Reality is purely a product of human misconception and only Brahman as mere impersonal 
consciousness (an oxymoron since consciousness is the essence of personality) is the absolute reality or 
truth. This philosophy, also called kevaladvaita, however, does not provide an alternative to material 
reductionism but merely an alternative reductionism. Instead of reducing everything to matter it proposes 
to reduce everything to impersonal consciousness. In fact, what is needed is an alternative way of 
thinking that is not based solely on the judgments of a finite ego that is found, for instance, in the abstract 
thinking of Kantian philosophy in the West as well as in the kevaladvaita interpretations of 
Shankaracharya in the East.
