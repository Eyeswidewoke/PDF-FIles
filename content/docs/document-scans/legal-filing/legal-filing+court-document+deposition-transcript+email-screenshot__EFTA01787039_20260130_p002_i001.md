However, even a business that has a =alid resale certificate will owe the use tax if the goods are =ubsequently taken out 
of inventory, held for sale to customers, and put to the =usinesses' own use. Consequently, a retail furniture store that 
=akes some desks out of its inventory and uses them to furnish its =ffices owes use tax on those desks. 20 
NYCRR§531.3(a). 
In a case involving the publisher of =enthouse magazine, Bob Guccione, artworks purchased by a registered =endor were 
held to be subject to sales tax since they were not purchased =E2 for one and only one purpose: resale" and were 
=isplayed at the residence and offices of Mr. Guccione. (P-H Fine Arts, Ltd. v. NYS Tax Appeals Tribunal, October 13, 1994 
aff'd. 227 AD2d 683, 3rd =/span>Dept., 1996). The New York Department of Taxation and Finance =as opined that 
lending art for display at a 
1 
2 
museum in New York is 'use' that =ould trigger the tax if the owner was a resident for sales and use tax =urposes when 
purchased. TSB-A-08(7)S. 
Delivery 
On Aug. 6, 2015, the New York State =epartment of Taxation and Finance issued TB-ST-155, =ntitled "Delivery Rules for 
New York State Sales Tax." This tax bulletin =iscusses the rules governing where delivery of property or services =ccurs 
and the resulting tax consequences. The bulletin also =e-emphasizes that a use tax is due if tangible personal property is 
purchased by an individual who maintains a place of abode in New York =without regard to how many days it is used) or 
by anyone engaged in business in New York who brings the goods into the =tate. 
The bulletin restates the rule that =he amount of sales tax due is determined based on the location where =elivery of 
tangible personal property is made—nothing new there. In an ordinary transaction where a =urchaser takes the goods 
with them upon the sale, the location of the sale determines the amount =f state and local sales tax due. If goods are 
purchased and then delivered by the seller's own =rucks, the location where delivery is made determines the tax due. 
=lso, if the seller ships the goods by common carrier (such as the =.S. Postal Service, FedEx, UPS, etc.) or the seller 
arranges shipment by a private or contract carrier, the location where the goods =re delivered determines the tax due. 
However, the bulletin makes clear =hat if the purchaser makes arrangements for =he goods to be picked up by a 
common 
carrier or private contract carrier, or if the =oods are delivered to an employee, agent, or representative of the 
=urchaser, sales tax is due based upon that location. This is a particular problem =or those whose purchases are very 
valuable and require special handling which, for many reasons not related to tax, a =urchaser may want to control. 
For example, if you are buying a =aluable, fragile piece of art, like a sculpture or large painting, =hich needs to be packed 
with extraordinary care and shipped through a service that specializes =n handling that type of art the purchaser might 
want to make those arrangements himself even if the location of ultimate =elivery is outside New York. In that case, 
New York sales tax would be due if you take delivery or send your agent to =ake the goods from New York to its ultimate 
destination in another state or foreign country. The tax consequence is =aced, in part, on the narrow definitions of 
delivery. 
This has caused uproar throughout the =alleries and art sellers in New York. Within weeks, TB-ST-155 =isappeared from 
the Department's website, except for one reference on =age 32 of Publication 750 (A Guide to Sales Tax in New York),
