Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers. 
Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes a corporation's board of directors to grant, and authorizes a 
court to award, indemnity to officers, directors, and other corporate agents. 
On the completion of this offering, as permitted by Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the 
Registrant's amended and restated certificate of incorporation will include provisions that eliminate the personal liability of its 
directors and officers for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty as directors and officers. 
In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of the Registrant to be in effect upon the completion of this offering provide that: 
• The Registrant shall indemnify its directors and officers for serving the Registrant in those capacities or for serving other 
business enterprises at the Registrant's request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides 
that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably 
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had 
no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. 
• The Registrant may, in its discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is 
permitted by applicable law. 
The Registrant is required to advance expenses, as incurred, to its directors and officers in connection with defending a 
proceeding, except that such director or officer shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that 
such person is not entitled to indemnification. 
Table of Contentr 
• The Registrant is not obligated pursuant to the amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to 
proceedings initiated by that person, except with respect to proceedings authorized by the Registrant's board of directors 
or brought to enforce a right to indermification. 
• The rights conferred in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws are not 
exclusive, and the Registrant is authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with its directors, officers, employees, 
and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons. 
• The Registrant may not retroactively amend the bylaw provisions to reduce its indemnification obligations to directors, 
officers, employees, and agents. 
The Registrant's policy is to enter into separate indemnification agreements with each of its directors and officers that provide 
the maximum indemnity allowed to directors and executive officers by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and 
also to provide for certain additional procedural protections. The Registrant also maintains directors and officers insurance to insure
