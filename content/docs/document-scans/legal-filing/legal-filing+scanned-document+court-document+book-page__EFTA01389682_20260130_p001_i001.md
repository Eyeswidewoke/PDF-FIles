GLDUS132 EverWatch Financial 
indirect interests in other funds managed or under the control of Glendower. Moreover, none of the 
limited partners of the Access Fund (the "Limited Partners"), the General Partner, Investment Manager 
or any of their respective affiliates has either (i) the right to participate in the control, management or 
operations of the Underlying Fund or (ii) the power to legally bind or commit the Underlying Fund, 
Glendower or any of their respective affiliates. No Glendower entity has (i) the right to participate in the 
control, management or operations of the Access Fund, the General Partner or any of their respective 
affiliates or (ii) the power to legally bind or commit the Access Fund, the General Partner or any of their 
respective affiliates except in certain limited circumstances set forth in the Underlying Fund LPA. If the 
Access Fund fails to make a capital contribution with respect to its investment in the Underlying Fund 
when due, whether as a result of a default of a Limited Partner or otherwise, the Underlying Fund may 
(but is not required to) exercise various remedies against the Access Fund and/or its Limited Partners on 
a look through basis, including forfeiture of all of its investment in the Underlying Fund. Both the Access 
Fund and the Underlying Fund impose administrative or management fees, custodial accounting and 
other service fees, performance allocations and other expenses that will reduce returns and returns to 
Limited Partners are likely to be lower than those from a direct investment in the Underlying Fund. 
Nothing contained in this paragraph or elsewhere in this Memorandum shall constitute a waiver by any 
investor or potential investor in the Access Fund of any of its legal rights under applicable U.S. federal 
securities laws or any other laws whose applicability is not permitted to be contractually waived. By 
subscribing for an interest in the Access Fund, each Limited Partner will be deemed to agree that 
Glendower will be a third-party beneficiary of this paragraph. 
The historical investment performance incorporated herein provides no assurance of the future performance of 
the Underlying Fund or of the future performance of the Access Fund and is not indicative of future results. 
There can be no assurance that the Underlying Fund will achieve comparable results. Return calculations in the 
Underlying Fund PPM include valuations for unrealized investments. Actual realized returns on unrealized 
investments will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, market conditions at the time of 
disposition, legal and contractual restrictions on transfer that may limit liquidity, any related transaction costs 
and the timing and manner of disposition, all of which may differ from the assumptions and valuations used in 
the historical investment performance data incorporated herein. Accordingly, the actual realized returns on 
unrealized investments may differ materially from the returns incorporated herein. There can be no assurance 
that the Underlying Fund will be able to implement its investment strategy, achieve its investment objective or 
avoid substantial losses. 
This Memorandum contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking 
terminology such as -may.- -seek.-  -expect.-  "estimate," or -believe' or the negatives thereof or other variations 
thereon or comparable terminology. Fonvard-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts, 
including statements about beliefs and expectations. Any statement in this Memorandum that contains 
intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions (and the assumptions underlying them) is a forward-looking 
statement. These assumptions are based on plans, estimates, and projections, as they are currently available. 
Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as of the date they are made, and none of the Underlying Fund, 
Glendower, the Access Fund, the General Partner, the Investment Manager or any of their respective affiliates 
undertakes to update any of them in light of new information or future events. Forward-looking statements 
involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could therefore cause actual results of 
the Underlying Fund and the Access Fund to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking 
statement. 
The terms of the Underlying Fund have not been finalized and may be subject to change in connection with 
continuing negotiation with prospective investors. The final terms of the Underlying Fund may be different 
from those summarized herein or provided in the materials incorporated by reference herein. A prospective 
investor should not invest unless it is able to sustain the loss of all or a significant portion of its investment. 
In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the Access Fund and the 
terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved, not all of which arc discussed in this Memorandum.
