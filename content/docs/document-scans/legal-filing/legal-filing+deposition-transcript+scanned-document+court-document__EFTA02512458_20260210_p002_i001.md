2017 Revs: $5B & =ositive FCF $133M — 5-6x trailing revs certainly possible, =mplying $25B+ valuation (In our SOTP for 
Vivendi we have music at 4x sales or €24bn) Ordinary Shares Outstanding: 176,976,280 reported as of =/22/18 
Valuation: At high =nd of recent trading, implies mkt cap $26B+ (very rough estimate). =owever, using current secondary 
market prices (- $125) implies a market =ap of —$22B (very rough estimate) 
o Client conversations point to a =20-22B valuation as being a level they might add

Industry Model: Record Labels own New Music =amp; Back Catalog — Distribute thru Spotify & Apple Music =o 
Consumers — key question is how does Spotify gain control =ver supply? 
Bull/Bear Views 
• 
Bull 
o Spotify becomes the Netflix of =usic by becoming a record label owning exclusive content — not =he case today and 
likely cash intensive 
o Spotify is an aggregator (not =etflix), it's taking a commission on providing all music any =ime you want — pushback 
likely would be then should be valued =n gross profit multiple 
Bear 
o Cash burn / Potential dilution =ices higher than expected as company pivots to become Netflix of music = paying up 
for performer exclusivity (good) but likely results in =igher than expected cash burn (bad) 
o Typical consumer model is =dvertising — give service away for free and get 3rd party advertisers to pay =or access to 
users. Typical business model is SaaS — =ubscription fee. Key for both is marginal cost to add users is =inimal. Due to 
royalty agreements, marginal costs for Spotify =row with user growth limiting operating leverage from network effect 
=similar to Lyft/Uber/Airbnb) 
Competition — =pple Music — Record labels 
Index Implications 
In =rder to be included in the S&P 500, a company must have been =rading for at least 12 months following an IPO as 
well have positive =arnings. As a result, we don't expect any index implications =or SPOT in the S&P 500 until these 
requirements are met. However, =t should be eligible for the S&P TMI and Completion indices. We are =till looking at 
implications for FTSE and MSCI based on domicile. 
Stock Loan Implications 
Given the structure of the IPO, there may be a delay in =hares settling INTO stock lending programs due to the DWAC 
process. =Delivery Withdrawal at Custodian). This potential delay will more than =ikely affect the initial Locate Liquidity 
for a few days. 
Happy to coordinate calls with John Egan, BAML's =hort Analytics Specialist 
Expected Trading Dynamics 
Our understanding is that on the =orning of trading, the Floor Specialist will act like a stabilizing =gent normally 
would (with banks advising) to help match supply and =emand

The opening is likely to be very =elayed as we will not know amount of shares to be bought/sold 
The stock has a decent =robability of trading up significantly on day 1 due to lack of pressure =ram selling 
shareholders & inability to source a locate 
Historical Private Share =rading 
2017: $37.50 to $125 
1/1/18 to 2/22/18: $90 to =132.50 (excl Tencent transaction) 
Some confusion on share =rices as secondary market =rices are currently -55000/share. Everything in =rospectus 
reflects a 40-to-one share split (this includes the =eneficiary certificates that the founders own)
