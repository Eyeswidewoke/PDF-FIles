Summary 
In his theory of evolution, Charles Darwin proposed that living beings were "all netted together" through a common 
ancestry. Yet o=e branch of the tree of life, the plant kingdom, was Darwin's most enduring foc=s. He was a major field 
collector, a consummate and sustained observer of plant life, a rigorous botanical experimentalist, and the high theorist 
of plant evolution. 
Botany played a pivotal part in each phase of Darwin's life. As an undergraduate, he collected=20 specimens for his 
botany professor's herbarium while on a geologica= expedition in Wales. Voyaging for five years aboard the HMS 
Beagle= he collected plants along with fossil bones and bird skins. Preparing to =rite On the Origin of Species, botany 
became critical to the growth of his evolutionary theory. Ultimately, he turned his home and the surrounding 
countryside into a botanical field station. 
Darwin's six botan=cal books would recast large areas of plant science. His studies on the fertilization of orchids, on 
insectivorous plants, and on the climbing and other plant movements were each a beautifully articulate example of how 
evolution could solve the traditional mysteries of natural history. Through his work, Darwin laid foundations for modern 
botany that remain firm to this day. 
Darwin's botanical formation 
Darwin was heir to a rich botanical tradition, one that often resonated in the specific botanical topics and viewpoints he 
was to adopt. His grandfather Erasmus Darwin, for example, was an evolutionist and spread the Linnaean doctrine that 
plants, just like animals, have sexes. Darwin's first botanical exposure was in his father's ample=garden at The Mount in 
Shrewsbury where young Charles played among apple trees bred by Thomas Andrew Knight, President of the Royal 
Horticultural Society. However, the foundations of Darwin's formal education in b=tany were laid at Cambridge by his 
dynamic professor John Stevens Henslow (1796-1861) who later opened the way for Darwin to participate in the 
B=agle's scientific cruise around the world. 
The Beagle =oyage 
The Beagle expedition concentrated on certain regions of South America: coastal Brazil, Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, the 
Andean coast as far north as Lima and the oceanic Galapagos archipelago. 
Plants came before birds in the birth of Darwinian evolution. Darwin did not become an evolutionist on the Galapagos, 
but the basis for a profound=20 shift in his understanding of species was established there — and i= began with plants. 
When the Beagle arrived in the Galapagos i= September 1835, Darwin immediately observed that the flora appeared 
unique. Thereupon, he collected "all the plants in flower".=This we know from a pocket field notebook that Darwin kept 
when he was in the archipelago. Darwin's Galapagos plant specimens, numbering wel= over 200, constitute the single 
most influential natural history collection of live organisms in the entire history of science. Indeed, Darwin'= plants 
represent the foundational collection for the entire Galapagos=20 flora. Settled back in London in 1837, he sketched his 
first evolutionary tree and began firmly applying the idea of descent with modification to all of natural history. 
In 1856, D=rwin put ink to blue foolscap and began to steadily write. His seminal boo=, On the Origin of Species, was 
finally published in November 185=.
