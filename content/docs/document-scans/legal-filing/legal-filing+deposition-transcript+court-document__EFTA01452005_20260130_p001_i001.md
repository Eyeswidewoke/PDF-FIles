Part B — Conflicts of interest relating to DB Private Equity and the Fund 
Management of the Fund 
The Manager (and its respective affiliates and team members) will devote such time to the management of the Fund as 
each, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to carry out the operations of the Fund effectively. The Manager may, in 
addition to the Secondary Team, instruct individuals from across the DB PE platform to assist with the Fund's investment 
activities and to serve on the Investment Committee. The Manager and its team members, including members of the 
Investment Committee who are part of the Secondary Team, may also work on projects for its affiliates, Deutsche Bank 
and other investment platforms and conflicts of interest may arise in allocating management time, services or functions 
among such affiliates, Deutsche Bank and other investment platforms. 
Investment by members of the management team 
Members of the management team of DB PE may invest personal funds directly or indirectly into the Fund or through 
other parallel investment entities. As such, their decisions may be influenced by the presence of their investment, and 
may not be completely unbiased. 
Carried Interest 
The entitlement of certain members of the Secondary Team and certain affiliates of Deutsche Bank to receive the 
economic benefit of the Carried Interest received by the Special Limited Partner may create an incentive for the Manager 
to make more speculative investments on behalf of the Fund than it would otherwise make in the absence of such 
Carried Interest. The existence of Carried Interest may result in conflicts of interest between the Manager and Investors 
with respect to the management and disposition of investments and the determination of the order, timing and amount of 
distributions by the Fund. 
The fact that the Carried Interest is linked to the performance of the Fund may create an incentive for the Manager to 
cause the Fund to make investments that are more speculative than would be the case in the absence of performance-
