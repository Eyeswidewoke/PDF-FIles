American Farmland Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Unaudited) 
1. ORGANIZATION 
American Farmland Company (together with its subsidiaries, the "Company"), a Maryland 
corporation, was established on October 9. 2009, and commenced its operations on October 15, 2009, 
for purposes of investing in farmland principally located in the United States. The Company conducts 
all of its activities through American Farmland Company L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), a 
Delaware limited partnership. The Company owned 81.2% and 80.8% of the common limited 
partnership interests in the Operating Partnership at Junc 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, 
respectively. 
The Company and American Farmland Advisors LW (AM) are Co-General Partners of the 
Operating Partnership. Since inception, affiliates of the members of AM (the "Founders") contributed 
$21,145,000 in capital to the Operating Partnership through June 30, 2015 and December 31. 2014, 
respectively, in addition to the capital provided to the Company from the proceeds of issuance of 
common stock. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements arc unaudited and include the accounts of the 
Company, the Operating Partnership and its wholly owned limited liability companies. All intercompany 
transactions and balances have been eliminated. In our opinion, all adjustments (which include only 
normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of 
operations and changes in cash flows have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures 
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been omitted. These consolidated financial 
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and for the years then ended included elsewhere in this prospectus. 
We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated fmancial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of 
the operating results for the full year. Certain prior period balances have been reclassified in order to 
conform to current period presentation. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents—The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with 
a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include an investment in a 
commercial paper fund and a money market fund. 
The Company maintains cash balances in major banks which, at times, may exceed the limits of 
amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Company had funds on 
deposit in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC; however, the Company believes the credit risk 
related to these deposits is minimal. 
Investments in Real Estate—Investments in real estate consist of farmland and improvements 
made to the farmland, consisting of buildings, wells, irrigation and drain systems. and trees and vines 
acquired in connection with the land purchase. Investments in real estate are recorded at cost. 
Improvements, replacements and costs of development for new trees and vines or the repurposing of 
raw land are capitalized when they extend the useful life or improve the use of the asset. Costs of
