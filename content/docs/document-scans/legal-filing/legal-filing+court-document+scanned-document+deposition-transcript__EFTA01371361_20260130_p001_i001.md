2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
vehicle is troubling and may indicate non-compliance with the terms of the settlement 
agreement, but this does not affect the fairness, reasonability, or adequacy of the 
settlement itself. 
c. Objection of Richard I. Ellenbogen 
Richard I. Ellenbogen [* 33] filed an objection on March 11, 2016, arguing that the 
settlement is unreasonable because the extended warranty does not cover vehicles, like 
his, that fall outside the time limit but have low mileage and may display defects in the 
future. ECF No. 78. Mr. Ellenbogen seeks either an extension of the warranty to 75,000 
miles without regard to the number of years or a complete recall repair of all Class 
Vehicles. Id. Plaintiffs note that Mr. Ellenbogen submitted a written request for exclusion 
on June 22, 2016. See ECF No. 107-1 Ex. C (opt-out list identifying Mr. Ellenbogen). 
Because Mr. Ellenbogen has requested exclusion from the N14 Class, he no longer has 
standing to object to the settlement. In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 282 F.R.D. 92, 110 
(D.N.J. 2012) ("The case law does not suggest that a class member requesting exclusion 
from a settlement may nonetheless object to that settlement.") 
d. Objection of Jerry D. Phillips 
Jerry D. Phillips filed an objection to the settlement on March 11, 2016, arguing that the 
service record documentation requirement is "particularly onerous" for the same reasons 
mentioned by Mr. Mirchandani, that MINI should turn over any service records it 
possesses to Class Members, and that the warranty extension is insufficient p341 for the 
same reasons mentioned by Ms. Williams and Mr. Ellenbogen. ECF No. 79. For the 
reasons discussed, none of these arguments renders the settlement unfair, unreasonable, 
or inadequate.,
2 Mr. Phillips also claims that "MINI sold their customers an engine containing parts that were 100% guaranteed to fail; the only 
thing uncertain was when it would fail." ECF No. 79 at 1 (emphasis in original). The Court's fairness analysis might be different if 
the failure of each Class Vehicle were guaranteed. As discussed. however, Plaintiffs acknowledge that the defect rate of the 
Class Vehicles is merely in the single digits." so the engines in most Class Vehicles will not fail because of the defect at issue. 
ECF No. 92 at 21. 
e. Objection of Thomas Brischler 
Thomas Brischler filed an objection on March 23, 2016, arguing again that the warranty 
extension is too short. ECF No. 80. Mr. Brischler acknowledges that, even though his 
vehicle does not fall under the extended warranty, he is eligible for reimbursement for 
timing chain and timing chain tensioner repairs or reimbursements, but states that he has 
not sought repairs because he will not be entitled to reimbursement if this Court rejects the 
r351 settlement agreement. Id. at 1-2. Mr. Brischler seeks a warranty extension and an 
extension of the claims period after the effective settlement date. Id. at 2. Mr. Brischler is 
correct that the finality of the settlement depends on the Court's approval, but this is not 
reason for the Court to withhold its approval.
