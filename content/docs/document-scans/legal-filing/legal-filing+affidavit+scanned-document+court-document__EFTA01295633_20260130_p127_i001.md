2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
believe that the agent has authority to act for the principal." Id. "Second, they must be such 
that the claimant's actual, subjective belief is objectively reasonable.Nd. 
4 "Actual authority may be express or implied." King. 886 P.2d at 165. "Implied authority is actual authority. cXcumstantialty 
proved, which the principal is deemed to have actually intended the agent to possess." Id For example. lalUlhority to perform 
particutar services for a principal carries with it the implied authority to perform the usual and necessary acts essential to carry 
out the authorized services." Id. Because, at this stage. Mr. Steadman does not advance any facts or argument supporting a 
finding of actual authority, the court does not address that theory in this order. 
The court finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether BoA made 
objective manifestations that caused Mr. Steadman to subjectively and reasonably believe 
that Mr. Ngo had authority to either modify BoA's specified terms of acceptance or to 
accept the modification ['21] agreement on BoA's behalf. One of the ways in which a 
principal can cloak a person in apparent authority is "by appointing a person to a position, 
such as that of manager or treasurer, which carries with it generally recognized duties; to 
those who know of the appointment there is apparent authority to do the things ordinarily 
entrusted to one occupying such a position." King, 886 P.2d at 165. BoA appointed Mr. 
Ngo to the position of Assistant Vice President, Mortgage Specialist II. (See Ford Decl. Ex. 
4 at 180-87.) When Mr. Steadman requested to participate in a loan modification program, 
Wells Fargo assigned Mr. Ngo to assist him. (2d Steadman Dep. at 13:8-16.) Mr. Ngo was 
Mr. Steadman's "main contact person" with respect to his loan modification. (2d Steadman 
Dep. at 31:14-16.) 
"One dealing in good faith with an agent who appears to be acting within the scope of his 
authority is not bound by undisclosed limitations on the agent's power." King, 886 P.2d at 
165. Mr. Ngo met with Mr. Steadman and helped Mr. Steadman submit a HAMP 
application with proper documentation. (Steadman Decl. at 2; Steadman Dep. at 82:4-83:4; 
2d Steadman Dep. at 13:1-14:21; Ford Decl. Ex. 4 at 180-87 (email from Mr. Ngo 
arranging a meeting with Mr. ('22] Steadman and instructing him which documents to 
bring), Ex. 2 at 50-53 (final HAMP application signed by Mr. Ngo and Mr. Steadman).) 
When Mr. Steadman contacted Mr. Ngo regarding how to deliver his acceptance and Mr. 
Ngo told him to bring the documents to his office, it could have reasonably appeared to Mr. 
Steadman that Mr. Ngo was acting within the scope of his authority. 
Mr. Steadman testifies that he subjectively believed Mr. Ngo had the authority to act on 
behalf of BoA. (Steadman Decl. at 2-3; Steadman Dep. at 105:1-25.) And a jury viewing 
these facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Steadman, Reeves, 530 U.S. at 150, could 
reasonably find that Mr. Steadman's belief was objectively reasonable. See King, 886 P.2d 
at 165. As such, summary judgment on the questions of acceptance and contract 
formation is inappropriate. See Keystone Land, 94 P.3d at 949. 
2. Statute of Frauds 
Agreements that "by their terms are not to be performed in one year" fall within the statute 
of frauds. RCW 19.36.010. So do contracts creating or evidencing any encumbrance on 
real estate. RCW 64.04.010; RCW 64.04.020. Under the statute of frauds, such contracts 
are unenforceable unless they are set forth in writing and signed by the party to be bound.
