2014 V.I. LEXIS 45, *; 61 V.I. 13, ** 
743, 489 N.E.2d 712 (1985). New York legislation provides that a court consider the efforts 
one spouse has made to the other spouse's career. See, N.Y. DoM. REL. LAW § 236(3)(1), 
(5). In O'Brien v. O'Brien, the Defendant-wife sought equitable distribution of the 
Plaintiff/Husband's license to practice medicine. The Plaintiff commenced the action for 
divorce two (2) months [* 28] after obtaining such license. The Plaintiff began his 
postgraduate classes after the parties were married. For the majority of the parties nine (9) 
years of marriage, he was working towards a career in medicine. Meanwhile, the 
Defendant maintained their household, relinquished her opportunity to further her career, 
and provided financially for the parties. The Defendant provided expert testimony 
evaluating the present value of the Plaintiff's medical license. O'Brien v. O'Brien, 66 N.Y.2d 
576, 498 N.Y.S.2d 743, 489 N.E.2d 712 (1985). 
[10] Here, Dr. Wright-Francis acquired her medical degree in 1992, she began working 
towards the degree years before the parties were married. There is no evidence that Mr. 
Francis was unjustly compelled to delay or relinquish his education or career goals in order 
for Dr. Wright-Francis to pursue her goals. Mr. Francis did not provide testimony on the 
amount in which he contributed to Dr. Wright-Francis' education. Furthermore, Mr. Francis 
does not offer personal or expert testimony on the potential or actual worth of Dr. Wright-
Francis' degree. Two (2) decades have passed since Dr. Wright-Francis received her 
medical degree. Mr. Francis failed to provide the Court any substantial or credible 
evidence to calculate a value of Dr. [119] Wright-Francis' medical degree. 
[11] 01N8] The Virgin Islands has long viewed "marriage as a partnership or joint venture, 
whereby both parties collaborate for a common purpose and contribute toward its 
success." See, Fuentes v. Fuentes, 247 F. Supp. 2d 714 (2003); Felix v. Felix, 1998 WL 
458499, *2 (D.V.I. 1998). 
It is important to note that Mr. Francis also received a higher education degree 
immediately before the marriage. Mr. Francis acquired his Master's in Business 
Administration in 1990 and is admittedly a well-qualified astute financial investment 
manager. The parties testified that [*.31] they supported each other with the help of their 
families in the early years of their relationship and marriage. Both degrees provided an 
expectancy of a better life, but this was not guaranteed by contract or other form of surety. 
Even so, both degrees launched successful and profitable careers for the parties. Both 
parties worked throughout the duration of the marriage and contributed financially to the 
marriage. 
Accordingly, Mr. Francis' evidence and testimony are insufficient to demonstrate that Dr. 
Wright-Francis' medical degree is marital property. In this instance, Dr. Wright-Francis' 
medical degree is her separate property and is not subject to equitable distribution.

[12] IHN9] The Court also has the authority to divide the personal property in divorce 
action even after a divorce decree has been issued. In Garcia, the Supreme Court explains 
that "the Superior Court will be required to issue rulings on post-divorce ownership of 
personal property ... such as cars, boats, electronics, jewelry, shares of stock, bonds and 
monies deposited with financial institutions ... ." Garcia, 59 V.I. 758.
