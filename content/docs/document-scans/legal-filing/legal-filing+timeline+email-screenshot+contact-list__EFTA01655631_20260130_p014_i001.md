U.S. Health Agency Says Employees Can Apply for Early Retirement 
Reuters (03/04,Wingrove, Levine) reported that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told 
employees on Monday they could apply for early retirement over the next 10 days and should respond to 
a request for information on their accomplishments of the past week, according to emails. The HHS told 
employees in an email that it received authorization on Monday from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management to offer early retirement under the Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, which impacts 
agencies "that are undergoing substantial restructuring, reshaping, downsizing, transfer of function or 
reorganization." According to the article, employees at HHS, which includes the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), had previously been told that 
they did not have to respond to DOGE's emails and there would be "no impact to your employment with 
the agency if you choose not to respond." Multiple other U.S. agencies had also told employees not to 
respond immediately to DOGE's demand, including the FBI and State Department. 
Federal Judge Awards $2 Million to Family of Man Killed by FBI Agent in Failed 
Hostage Rescue 
Houston Landing (03/04, Trombly) reported that a federal judge in Houston awarded nearly $2 million in 
damages on Monday to the mother and son of a Honduran man fatally shot by an FBI agent during a 
botched rescue attempt in 2018. Judge Kenneth Hoyt ruled that Special Agent Gavin Lappe acted 
negligently by firing his rifle through the window of a home fatally wounding Ulises Valladares. The article 
stated that Hoyt also found no evidence to support Lappe's claim that Valladares, who had been held for 
ransom, had grabbed his gun. "Statements by the agents otherwise are not only untrue and unsupported 
by scientific evidence or logic, they represent intentional falsehoods," Hoyt wrote in a ten-page order. The 
article noted that Hoyt determined that Lappe's actions were negligent and concluded that the federal 
government could be held liable for Valladares's death. As a result, Valladares's family members were 
awarded damages, which included compensation for the emotional distress of losing him, the loss of 
financial support, and the costs of repatriating his body to Honduras. Valladares's son, Ulysses Valladares 
Jr., was awarded $1.3 million, while Valladares's mother, Justina Garcia, received $611,000. Hoyt also 
granted $475,000 in attorney fees.

remains of missing Clay County, Florida, woman Susan Mauldin. According to the article, this historic case
