New York treats Mom as if she were a New York resident, and her taxable estate — the $5.34 million 
credit shelter trust for Dad — exceeds New York's $1 million exclusion, thereby triggering hypothetical 
New York estate tax of $431,600. Since Mom's interest in the condo represents 5% of her estate, her 
New York estate tax is 521,580 (5% of $431,600). 
The "new" New York estate tax produces a dramatically different result in this example: New York now only 
taxes non-resident decedents on their New York-situs real and tangible personal property: it also gives 
residents and non-residents alike the same New York estate tax exclusion, and does not reduce a non-
resident decedent's exclusion to reflect the ratio of New York property to the decedent's overall estate. To 
illustrate: 
"New" New York law. Same facts as above, except that Mom dies in April 2014. Her estate owes no 
New York estate tax, as the disposition to Dad qualifies for the marital deduction, which defers estate tax 
until Dad's death. Even if Mom were widowed and left the $800,000 condo to her children, her estate 
would still not be subject to New York estate tax because her New York taxable estate (the condo) is 
under the $2,062,500 New York exclusion in effect at her death. If widowed Mom's condo were worth 
$2.062,500 and she left it to her children, her estate would owe no New York estate tax; if her condo 
were worth $2,165,625 (5% more than the New York exclusion at her death), her estate would owe 
5112,050 in New York estate tax — the same amount that a resident decedent would owe if her taxable 
estate were over the exclusion amount by 5%. 
Comments. This change for non-residents is a big deal — and means that non-resident married couples 
with New York real or tangible personal property will no longer have the unhappy surprise illustrated above 
at the first spouse's death. Indeed, regardless of the size of the non-resident's New York estate, if it passes 
to the surviving spouse in a disposition that qualifies for the marital deduction, no New York estate tax will be 
payable until the surviving spouse's death (assuming the spouse still owns that New York property at 
death).' But what about once that spouse is widowed — or suppose the New York non-resident is single? Is 
there a way to reduce the potential New York estate tax on that New York property, assuming its value will 
likely exceed the New York exclusion in effect at that non-resident's death? 
Before addressing that question, let us review a few things: 
• 
The New York estate tax applies to a non-resident's real or tangible personal property that is located in 
New York; it does not apply to a non-resident's Intangible property." 
• 
"Intangible properly" refers to items such as stocks, bonds and interests in entities such as limited 
liability companies and partnerships; it is deemed to "reside" with its owner. 
• 
The New York State Constitution bars New York from imposing estate tax on a non-resident's intangible 
property (see Article XVI, § 3). 
• 
A "single member limited liability company" is a limited liability company (LLC) with one member; unless 
that single member LLC has elected to be treated as a corporation, it is disregarded for income tax 
purposes, and is effectively treated as -one" with its owner/member. 
• 
A Subchapter S corporation is a "pass-through" entity that passes through its income to shareholders, 
and is therefore not subject to corporate-level income tax. 
' Note that, in general. if the non-resident gives away New York real or tangible personal property (or intangible property 
connected with a New York trade or business) within three years of death, New York will pull that property back into the 
non-resident decedents New York estate.
