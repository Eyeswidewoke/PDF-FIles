Emirate stated that there is no current need for the rest of the money. Does this mean that 
the Government of Dubai has closed the doors for new subscription to a second tranche? 
Will support be provided by the Government of Dubai for the companies as a grant? 
The doors to subscription have not been shut down. The subscriptions so far meet our requirements. The support 
given to companies is not a grant, because its origin is the bill, and companies possess productive assets that 
enable them to meet all the requirements. The problem of these companies is part of the liquidity problem that 
has afflicted the financial system and banking world.

Looking at the entities that will avail from Dubai government's financial support, can we 
say that Dubai government affiliate companies have overestimated their financial 
capabilities to cover development requirements, then subsequently their administrations 
became responsible for the level of these companies' transparency in handling their 
projects? 
The global financial crisis took all countries by surprise and was much bigger than any economy or large 
companies across the world. It is not really helpful for anyone to claim wisdom in hindsight. Learning the lesson 
well is the true bottom line of this crisis. I have always repeated that only the one who works is one who is likely 
to commit errors. But the most important thing is to learn not to repeat the same error twice. Definitely gaps that 
may be revealed through current reform efforts will be immediately addressed and rectified.

Your Highness, you have put Emiratization on top of the country's development priorities. 
Over the years, the UAE population has grown significantly to the extent that expat 
residents have become absolute majority. Meanwhile, number of private sector companies 
has significantly increased as well. How do you see this impacting the UAE nationals' job 
opportunities? Do you believe it might be necessary to expand the Emiratization plan to 
cover a larger portion of the private sector companies? 
The Emiratization plan is primarily based on training and qualifying UAE nationals, equipping them with all 
necessary tools and competencies a nd supporting them to confidently compete in the job market. I am positive 
that most of the private sector companies prefer to recruit UAE nationals as part of their Corporate Social 
Responsibilities. Also salaries of UAE nationals — however high they may appear to be - are far less than those of 
expats. Employing a UAE national will open the door for more interaction with government departments and 
local customers, who are eventually the highest spenders. If some companies fall short of their responsibilities 
toward the local workforce, then the government will intervene through a set of measures and incentives to 
encourage these companies to live up to the expected level of responsibility.

Many countries have applauded the UAE's hospitality and praised the level of respect it 
shows to the expat communities and the freedom it offers them to lead their business and 
social lives in perfect ease. This encouraged many expats to reside in the IJAE for long 
period of time, evolving the same habits and traditions of the local community as well as
