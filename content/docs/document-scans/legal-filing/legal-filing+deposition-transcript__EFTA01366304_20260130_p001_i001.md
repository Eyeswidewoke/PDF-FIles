been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this 
prospectus forms part, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to 
waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares

business combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating 
distributions from the trust account with icspeet to their founder 
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination

will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account 
with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete 
our business combination within the prescribed time frame). If we
