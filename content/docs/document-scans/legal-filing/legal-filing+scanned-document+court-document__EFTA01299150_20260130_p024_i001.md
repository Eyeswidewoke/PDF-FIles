more than once in the style of the Amended Complaint. 
One of the contentions raised by the defendants in their joint motion to dismiss is that not all defendants have been properly 
served. The Court will reserve ruling on the service aspects of the motion to dismiss. 
["5] Plaintiff invokes the Court's jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 2201, 2202, 15 
U.S.C. §§ 15, 26, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985 and 1986. The Court has jurisdiction to 
decide all of the issues raised by the motion to dismiss. 
[HN1] When determining a motion to dismiss, of course, the Court is obliged to construe 
all of the material allegations contained in the Amended Complaint in the light most 
favorable to the plaintiff with those allegations accepted as true. See, e.g., Jenkins v. 
McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 89 S. Ct. 1843, 23 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1969); Voter Information 
Project v. City of Baton Rouge, 612 F.2d 208 (5th Cir. 1980); 5 Wright & Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure: Civil § 1363 (1969). Moreover, [FIN2] dismissal of an action on a 
barebones pleading should always be carefully and deliberately considered since it is a 
precarious option with a high mortality rate. Voter Information Project, supra; Barber v. 
MN "Blue Cat," 372 F.2d 626 (5th Cir. 1967). 
Plaintiff has proceeded pro se with his action from its inception despite the Court's 
admonition that the assistance of counsel would be highly beneficial in this case, a cause 
involving several subtle and complex issues of law. [**6] In considering the motion to 
dismiss, however, the Court has not penalized plaintiff for proceeding in his own behalf 
where the law mandates that [I-IN3] pro se pleadings are to be held to a less stringent 
standard than those drafted by an attorney. Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S. Ct. 594, 
30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972); Craft v. Texas Board of Pardons & Paroles, 550 F.2d 1054 (5th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 926, 98 S. Ct. 408, 54 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1977); Shaw v. Briscoe, 
541 F.2d 489 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 933, 97 S. Ct. 1556, 51 L. Ed. 2d 778
