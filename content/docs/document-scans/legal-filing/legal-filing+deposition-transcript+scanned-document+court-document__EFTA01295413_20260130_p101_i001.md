376 III. App. 3d 599, *; 876 N.E.2d 129, **; 
2007 III. App. LEXIS 962, ***; 315 III. Dec. 129 
"This guaranty is irrevocable, absolute. present. continuing and unconditional. and the obligation of (the Swentos) shall 
not be released or affected by (a) any extensions of time. indulgences or modifications r"2O] which Landlord may 
extend with Tenant in the performance of said Lease: (b) any failure of Landlord to enforce any of the conditions of said 
Lease: (c) any assignment of the lease by Tenant; or (d) any COMM which Landlord may give to such assignment." 
The personal guaranty further provided that the "guaranty shall also inure to the benefit of 
Landlord's successors, assigns, and legal representatives." In light of the express 
provisions of the guaranty, we find that by agreeing that their obligation would continue 
even if the landlord granted extensions of time to the tenant or otherwise modified the 
lease, the Swentos granted the landlord the right to make such extensions or modifications 
without impairing the validity of the guaranty. See Zirp-Bumham, 356 III. App. 3d at 605 
(where language of original guaranty provided that the guarantor "guarantee[d] the 
landlords, its successors and assigns, the prompt and full payment of all Rent,' 
'notwithstanding any amendment, addition, assignment, sublease, transfer, renewal, 
extension or other modification of the Lease,"' (emphasis omitted) the guarantor was not 
relieved from personal liability due to an allegedly erroneous listing of [..21] the trustee 
and landlord on a second reaffirmation of the guaranty because the landlord did not 
require the guarantor's reaffirmation to receive the benefit of the original guaranty under 
the language of that original guaranty). We therefore conclude that the Swentos were not 
discharged from the guaranty due to the modifications contained in the Agreement. 
B. Affirmative Defense of Estoppel by Waiver 
The Swentos next contend that the circuit court erred in granting ["610] CEC's motion for 
a directed verdict where it denied the Swentos the opportunity to present their affirmative 
defense of estoppel by waiver. The Swentos argue that CEC is estopped from seeking a 
judgment against the Swentos where CEC entered into the Agreement solely with Jeepers 
and Jeepers ['"139] Illinois that superceded the lease. The Swentos maintain that 
neither CEC's forcible eviction and detainer action nor the Agreement contemplated the 
Swentos as guarantors to the lease and CEC should be prevented from reverting to the 
1991 personal guaranty. In the alternative, the Swentos argue that CEC and Jeepers 
Illinois entered into an executory accord that prevents CEC from attempting to collect the 
same debt from the Swentos as a ("1'22] nonparty to that accord. 
CEC argues that the Swentos waived these purported defenses by failing to raise them 
before the trial court. We agree. The record shows that the Swentos' counterclaim and 
affirmative defenses included promissory estoppel, in which the Swentos alleged that CEC 
was estopped from asserting its rights under the lease because it broke off negotiations to 
extend the lease for an additional time period after Jeepers Illinois failed to pay overdue 
rent. However, the Swentos did not present to the circuit court the estoppel by waiver 
arguments that they advance on appeal and these arguments are therefore waived. See 
Robidoux v. Oliphant, 201 III. 2d 324, 344, 775 N.E.2d 987, 266 III. Dec. 915 (2002). 
Waiver aside, we find that the Swentos arguments are without merit. The Swentos first 
assert that CEC is estopped from seeking a judgment against the Swentos, where CEC 
entered into the Agreement solely with Jeepers and Jeepers Illinois and where CEC did 
not name the Swentos in the forcible eviction and detainer action, ignores the fact that, as 
already discussed, the personal guaranty's language provided that the guaranty would
