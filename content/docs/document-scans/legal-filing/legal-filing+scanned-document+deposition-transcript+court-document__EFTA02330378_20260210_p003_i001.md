=rogrammes(81. =alking and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise programmes have been shown to reduce bone loss 
although they did not increase significantly =one mineral density (BMD) compared to controls in the first few years =f 
menopause[4] and =hey showed limited effects on bone in postmenopausal women[9]. 
Vibration could be a viable alternative in frail people(10,111. =hole-body vibration (WBV) is a new type of 
exercise that has been =ncreasingly tested for the ability to prevent bone fractures and =steoporosis[3,12-15J. =ecent 
studies of WBV have shown a positive effect of controlled WBV on =ait, body balance and motor capacity[16]. =owever, 
the treatment has to follow specific safety guidelines[17] to =revent exercise-related injuries (back pain, muscular 
discomfort, =tc.), such as limiting the exposure to vibration to a maximum of 10 =inutes and maintaining the posture of 
the participant in a semi-squat =tance with knees flexed, with active involvement of the leg muscles to =educe the 
transmission of vibration to the head. 
The currently marketed =evices that deliver sinusoidal vibration to the whole body use two =ifferent types of 
vibrating plates[171: a) =he whole plate oscillates up and down; b) reciprocating vertical =isplacements on the left and 
right side of a fulcrum, increasing the =ateral accelerations. A few studies have shown recently that there is =carce 
evidence of the effectiveness of the up-and-down plate for =ncreasing BMD in experimental animals[13j or =umans(15J; 
but =he literature is largely lacking studies of the effect of the =eciprocating plate technique. 
Currently available WBV exercise devices deliver vibrations =t frequencies of 15-60 Hz. Investigators usually 
administered =requencies at 15-35 Hz to obtain the maximum transmissibility =f the mechanical stimulus produced by 
the vibrating plate[18J. On =he other hand, since the resonance frequency for the WBV is in the =ange of 5-10 Hz [191, 
the =requencies lower than 20 Hz has been usually avoided. However, some =ecent studies have included in their 
protocols frequencies at 10—=5 Hz to allow for gentle adaptation in frail populations (nursing home =esidents, elder, 
rehabilitation programs, etc.)116,201. But, =o our knowledge, none of them have reported the specific effect of =hese 
low frequencies on bone mass. This knowledge could specially =ontribute to make decisions on the WBV programs to 
frail people. =owever, prior to administer these WBV programs in frail people, these =rograms have to be tested in 
healthy population. 
The purpose of the current =tudy is to determine whether 8 months of WBV exercise at 12.6 Hz using = 
reciprocating plate is more effective than walking for improving BMD =nd balance in healthy postmenopausal women.

Subjects and study design 
Figure <=pan class="figpopup-sensitive-area" style="cursor: pointer; =ext-decoration: none; position: absolute; 
top: Opx; opacity: 0; color: =ransparent; background-color: transparent; left: =3em;">Figurell shows that 36 
postmenopausal =omen recruited through advertisements in local newspapers volunteered =o participate in the study; 
however, only the 28 who completed the =rial are included in the analysis. Informed consent was obtained from =11 
qualified volunteers. The inclusion criteria were: at least 5 years =rom the last menstruation; adequate nutritional status 
according to WHO =orms (as determined by questionnaire); non-smoker; consumption of no =ore than four alcoholic 
beverages per week; the ability to follow the =rotocol; free from disease or medication known to affect bone =etabolism 
or muscle strength. A questionnaire designed to gather =nformation about current and previous dietary factors, 
including intake =f calcium and vitamin D, was administered. At baseline, serum =steocalcin and urinary 
deoxypyridinoline crosslinks and creatinine were =etermined as markers of bone formation and resorption, 
respectively[211.

Exclusion criteria were: acute hernia; =hrombosis; any pharmacologic intervention for osteopenia within the 
=revious 6 months; any history of severe musculoskeletal problems; =ngaged in high-impact activity at least twice a 
week (any =eight-bearing activity or exercise more intense than brisk =alking). 
All =ubjects were assigned at random to one of the study groups. A total of =4 women trained for 8 months on a 
vibrating plate via reciprocation =the WBV group). The other 14 women participated in a walking activity =the Walking
