1) The FDA has studied and approved 1,453 drugs in its entire history. 
2) Seventy percent of the US population takes at least one prescription drug each month. The number of deaths from 
prescription drugs in the US each year exceeds deaths from illegal drugs, as well as from automobile accidents. Over 4 
billion prescriptions were written in the US last year by health care professionals. 
3) The total number of prescription drugs on the marketplace in the US is unknown, unpublished, and not tracked by the 
FDA. The clearest database is from the National Library of Medicine which lists 88,212 prescription drug compounds on 
file in the US. There are over 300,000 over-the-counter (OTC) drug products marketed in the US. The number of 
nutraceutical products is unknown, but sales in the US are estimated to be approaching $200 billion dollars per year, 
while dietary supplements and vitamins sales exceed $27 billion per year. Probiotics are rapidly growing in popularity, 
and worldwide sales are expected to exceed $50 billion dollars per year by 2020. 
4) Most physicians and the public are unaware that the vast majority of prescription drugs in the US marketplace have 
not been studied or approved by the FDA. They are legally marketed only because of a 1938 legislative loophole 
grandfathering the continuation of their marketing and sale to physicians and the public. 
5) A significant number of the 440,000 deaths in US hospitals each year arise from medical errors due to pharmaceutical 
adverse reactions or interactions. The cost to society of adverse drug reactions in the US exceeds $136 billion per year. 
6) In 2004 an FDA approved drug was withdrawn after five years on the marketplace, and only in retrospect was found 
to be responsible for an estimated 38,000 fatalities in the US alone. Ironically, thousands of unproven drugs continue to 
be legally marketed while an FDA committee denied approval for a novel potentially lifesaving drug for Duchenne 
Muscular dystrophy. The denial was because the small number of study subjects, as expected with a rare disease, did 
not reach statistical proof of safety even though no participants had an adverse reaction. 
7) Comprehensive and conscientious post-marketing surveillance should be required for all products promoted and sold 
as therapeutic, including prescription, OTC, nutraceuticals, probiotics, etc. There should be an emphasis on precision 
genomic information to enhance safety by identifying sub-populations with optional benefits and higher risk of adverse 
events. 
8) The cross referencing of poly-pharmacy risk of drug-drug interaction including over the counter (OTC), nutraceuticals, 
probiotics, etc., and other data end points subject to meta-analysis, while preserving individual privacy rights, will 
greatly enhance public health and safety.

How do you feel about an 800 word Op ed , slightly less inflammatory 
Also when you cite over 10,000 drugs without science documentation are you referring to over the counter 
drugs 
Can you summarize everything in a few bullet points ?
