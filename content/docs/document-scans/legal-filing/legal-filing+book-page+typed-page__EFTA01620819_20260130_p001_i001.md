Fungal associations of basal 
vascular plants: reopening a 
closed book? 
Introduction 
The widely held hypothesis that Glomeromycota fungi alone 
formed the ancestral land plant—fungus symbiosis (Pirozynski & 
Da!pi, 1989; Selosse & Le Tacon, 1998; Wang & Qiu, 2006; 
Parniske, 2008) has recently been challenged by new lines of 
evidence from molecular, cytological, functional and palaeonto-
logical studies. First, liverworts of the earliest divergent Glade, the 
Haplomitriopsida, form a mutualistic mycorrhiza-like relation-
ship, whereby there is reciprocal exchange of plant carbon (C) for 
fungal nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), with members of the 
Mucoromycotina (Bidartondo et al, 2011; Field et 
2014), a 
fungal lineage considered basal or sister to the Glomeromycota 
(James etal., 2006; Lin nal, 2014). Second, other basal plants, 
including complex and simple thalloid liverworts and homworts, 
enter into associations with both Mucoromycotina and Glomer-
omycota fungi, sometimes simultaneously (Bidartondo et at, 
2011; Desire, eta!, 2013). Third, dual partnerships involving 
fungi with affinities to Glomeromycota and Mucoromycotina have 
been reported in fossils of early vascular plants from the Devonian 
(Strullu-Derrien et al, 2014). 
Turning to the fungal associations of the extant representatives of 
the early diverging vascular plant lineages, the glomeromycete 
identity of fungi in ferns (Monilophyta) has never been questioned 
—a consensus borne out by cytology and limited DNA sequencing 
data (Wang & Qiu, 2006; Ogura-Tsujita etal., 2013). By contrast, 
the unusual cytology of fungal colonization in lycopods 
(Lycopodiophyra), highly reminiscent of the cytology reported in the 
Haplomitriopsida genus Treubia (Duckett et al, 2006), suggested 
unique fungal partnerships or ilycopodioid mycothallus interac-
tions' (Duckett & Ligrone, 1992; Schmid & Oberwinlder, 1993) 
until a molecular study detected Glomeromycota in this group 
(Winther & Friedman, 2008), thus 'laying to rest over a century of 
speculations and uncertainty' surrounding their identity (Leake 
et al, 2008). However, Windier & Friedman's study, and a more 
recent investigation proposing a basidiomycete as the main 
symbiont in a member of the Lycopodiaceae (Horn eta!, 2013; 
but see rebuttal in Strullu-Derrien eta& 2014 criticizing their 
limited molecular and microscopical data), used methods that do 
not detect Mucoromycotina fungi. Therefore, it remains to be 
determined whether members of the Mucoromycotina related to 
the fungi known to enter into mutualism with basal liverworts 
(Field et al, 2014) also form associations with vascular plants. To 
test this possibility, we carried out molecular and microscopical 
analyses of the fungal associations of all the major lineages of 
lycopods and ferns. 
Materials and Methods 
Sampling sites were globally distributed (Supporting Information 
Table S1). At least one mature plant colony was collected from each 
site. Plants were processed for cytological and molecular analyses 
within 1 wk of collection by removing and cleaning roots with 
forceps and sterile water. Roots were prepared for scanning and 
transmission electron microscopy as previously described (Pressel 
et al, 2010; Desire end, 2013). Extraction and sequencing of 
genomic fungal DNA were performed using the method of 
Bidartondo et al (2011). In brief, the universal fungal 18S primer 
combination NS1 (White et 4, 1990) and EF3 (Smit et at, 1999) 
was used to amplify DNA which was cloned (TOPO TA; 
Invitrogen) and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Genetic 
Analyser 3730 (Waltham, MA, USA). Between four and eight 
clones were sequenced for each sample and identified using NCBI 
BLAST (Altschul et al, 1997). Sequence editing and assembly were 
performed in Geneious v5.6 (http://www.geneious.com). The 
alignment algorithms of MUSCLE were used within MEGA v5.1 
(Tamura et al, 2011), with reference sequences from GenBank. 
Using UCHIME (Edgar et al, 2011) within MOTHUR (http:// 
www.mothur.org), confirmed sequences were not chimeric. Evo-
lutionary models were tested in MEGA. Bayesian inference was 
carried out using MrBayes (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist, 2001) and 
FigTree v1.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk) for visualization and edit-
ing. Representative DNA sequences have been deposited in 
GenBank (KJ952212—KJ952241). 
Results 
Molecular and cytological analyses showed that both Mucoromy-
cotina and Glomeromycota fungi associate with lycopods and ferns 
(Figs 1, 2). We examined samples from 20 lycopod and 18 fern 
species, and detected fungi in seven and 13 species, respectively 
(Table S1). Glomeromycota fungi were present in three lycopod 
species while Mucoromycotina were found in four. Fungal 
colonization was detected in only 17 of the 101 lycopod samples 
analysed. Diverse Mucoromycotina fungi colonized lycopods, 
sometimes occurring within the same species, and even the same 
plant, and six new Mucoromycotina clades were discovered (Fig. 
S2). Colonization rates in ferns were higher (33 out of 58 samples) 
and showed specificity to Glomeromycota (Fig. SI). Ferns 
exclusively contained members of the order Glomerales, with the 
exception of one Ophioglossum (Diversisporales), one Psi/arum 
(Archaeosporales), one Tmetipteris (Archaeosporales), and three
