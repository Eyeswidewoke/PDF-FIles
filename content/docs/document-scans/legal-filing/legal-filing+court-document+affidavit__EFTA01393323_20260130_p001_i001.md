GLDUS130 Aspen Grove Capital, LLC 
preferred dividends are attributable to periods totaling less than 367 days, the 60 day holding period 
discussed herein applies. A dividend is not qualified dividend income to the extent that the Access Fund is 
under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect 
to positions in substantially similar or related property. If the Access Fund realizes qualified dividend 
income, the Access Fund will report to its Limited Partners their respective shares of such income. 
Notwithstanding the above, a Limited Partner's allocable sham of qualified dividend income will not 
qualify for the reduced rate to the extent such Limited Partner elects to include such dividend income as 
investment income for purposes of the investment interest expense deduction discussed below. A Limited 
Partner's foreign tax credit may be limited to the extent it relates to qualified dividend income taxed at the 
reduced rates of tax. 
Dividends-Received Deduction. A portion of income from the Access Fund allocable to corporate Limited 
Partners may qualify for the "dividends-received deduction." The dividends-received deduction applies to 
certain dividends received from certain corporations. 
Medicare Tax. A 3.8% Medicare contribution tax generally is imposed on the net investment income of 
U.S. individuals, estates and trusts whose income exceeds certain threshold amounts. For U.S. individuals, 
this threshold generally will be exceeded if an individual has adjusted gross income that exceeds $200,000 
($250,000 if married and filing jointly/$125,000 if married and filing separately). For this purpose, net 
investment income generally is expected to include a Limited Partner's distributive share of the Access 
Fund's income and net gains, as well as net capital gains attributable to a sale of the Limited Partner's 
Interests, over deductions properly allocable to such income and net gains. Prospective Limited Partners 
that are U.S. individuals, estates or trusts am urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability 
of the Medicare tax in their particular circumstances. 
Taxation of Interests—Other Taxes. The Access Fund and Limited Partners may be subject to other taxes, 
such as the alternative minimum tax and foreign, state and local income taxes (including withholding taxes) 
and estate, inheritance or intangible property taxes that may be imposed by various jurisdictions, including 
the State and City of New York, where the Access Fund's principal office is currently located, and any 
other state in which the Access Fund is deemed to conduct business or hold assets. For taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1. 2026, substantial limitations will apply to 
investors' ability to deduct their allocable share of any such state and local taxes. Each prospective investor 
should consider the potential consequences of such taxes on an investment in the Access Fund. It is the 
responsibility of each prospective investor to satisfy itself as to, among other things, the legal and tax 
consequences of an investment in the Access Fund under state law, including the laws of the state(s) of its 
domicile and its residence, by obtaining advice from its own tax advisor, and to file all appropriate tax 
returns that may be required. 
The Access Fund will treat any tax withheld from or otherwise payable with respect to income allocable to 
the Access Fund as cash received by the Access Fund and will treat each Limited Partner as receiving as a 
distribution the portion of such tax that is attributable to such Limited Partner and therefore shall reduce 
distributions otherwise to be made to such Limited Partner. Similar provisions would apply in the case of 
taxes required to be withheld by the Access Fund or when the Access Fund must pay taxes on behalf of the 
Limited Partners. 
Possible Legislative or Other Changes. The Code, with respect to all of the foregoing matters and other 
matters that may affect the Access Fund or its Limited Partners, is subject to change by Congress. In recent 
years, there have been significant changes in the Code, some of which arc being reconsidered by Congress 
and interpretations of which are being considered by the IRS and the courts. It is not possible at this time
