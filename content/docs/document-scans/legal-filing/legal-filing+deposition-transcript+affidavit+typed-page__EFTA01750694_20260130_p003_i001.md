have indicated that Qatar and Turkey are now working on alternative ceasefire plan: indeed, Prime 
Minister Erdogan and Sheikh Tamim met on July 16th to discuss the potential effort to end hostilities. 
Jordan: Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood—the Islamic Action Front (IAF)—seems to have taken a more 
moderate tack recently, possibly in an attempt to heal rifts within the party between moderate and 
conservative voices while gaining favor in the eyes of the government as the lesser of two Islamist 
threats. At a news conference on July 2nd, IAF announced an extensive economic policy proposal for 
the country, which was circulated to various government ministries. While Jordan's executive branch 
remained largely silent, media officials commented that "They [the IAF] are a part of the national 
fabric...We hope this signals a more meaningful engagement in public affairs." 
In an apparent indication of the Jordanian concern of spillover from Syria and Iraq, Jordan's army 
recently announced a drive for new recruits. While officials maintain that this is standard procedure, 
there is speculation that it directly relates to the advances of the Islamic State in Iraq, given that Abu 
Musab AI-Zarqawi—considered the Islamic State's "spiritual father"—was a Jordanian national who 
headed up al-Qaeda in Iraq until he was killed by US forces in 2006. Recent demonstrations in the 
area of Ma'an saw protestors align with the Islamic State by calling themselves the "Fallujah of 
Jordan" and thus, suggest the possibility of some grassroots support for IS within certain pockets of 
Jordanian society. 
Kuwait: Politics in Kuwait heated up again this month, as Kuwaitis took to the streets in illegal 
protests and demanded political reform—in particular, a more empowered and representative 
national assembly and the release of imprisoned political leaders (most recently, opposition leader 
Musallam al-Barak). In an apparent response to the increase in public pressure, the Kuwaiti 
government recently threatened to revoke the citizenship of those suspected of undermining the 
security and stability of the state, further fueling political tensions. 
The government announced an "iron fist" policy against those who threaten the state and increased 
scrutiny of the activities of nongovernmental associations to make sure they are not engaging in 
political arenas. Protests have been taking place in Kuwait since 2006 and bring together various 
disaffected groups, including young people, powerful tribal groups, Islamists, nationalists, human 
rights activists, and "bidoun" Kuwaitis who lack full nationality and rights. The tensions are likely to 
continue to run high as opposition leader al-Barak's trial for insulting the supreme judicial council and 
slandering its chairman (a crime for which he could receive three years in jail) is set to resume in 
September and as the political turmoil and Islamist advance continue in neighboring Iraq. 
Yemen: Following a several-day battle in the northern area of Amran between Houthi militants on 
one side and local army units and tribes affiliated with the Isiah party on the other, the UN Security 
Council issued a statement on July 11th "demanding that the Houthis and all armed groups and 
parties involved in the violence withdraw" and urging the Panel of Experts "to look into [peace] 
spoilers as a matter of urgency and to present expeditiously relevant recommendations to the 
[Sanctions] Committee established pursuant to the resolution 2140 (2014)." 
While violence initially subsided following mediation efforts of UN Special Envoy Jamal Benomar, 
fighting has since resumed over strategic vantage points despite efforts to put in place a more neutral 
army unit in Amran. Further, the fallout of this most recent fighting in the north has highlighted 
internal complexities within the armed forces, as two high-ranking army commanders have been 
sacked and another seen to be closely aligned with the Isiah movement has had his powers curtailed.
