population centers" — a formulation widely believed to refer to the two or three largest Israeli settlement blocs — or to 
return to the 1949 Armistice lines; rather, Bush said, a peace agreement can be achieved only "on the basis of mutually 
agreed changes that reflect these realities." 
On one level, a central question is whether there is any fundamental difference between Bush's, Clinton's and Obama's 
ways of framing the issue. 
The answer is somewhat yes, but mostly no. Obama talked about a starting point for the negotiations on the border, 
while Bush talked about an end point. Both statements assume that the basis for negotiating the border is the line of 
1967 or the armistice line of 1949 — effectively the same line. 
Further, Obama said a number of things in his speech specifically supportive of what Netanyahu has been demanding. 
He said Hamas <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Hamas> is not a partner for peace as long as it does not recognize 
Israel or renounce terrorism. By implication, the President thus effectively opposed the recent reconciliation agreement 
between Fatah <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Fatah+Organization>, which renounced terrorism in the 1993 
Oslo <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Oslo> Accords, and Hamas, which has not renounced terrorism. Obama also 
criticized the Palestinians for considering a unilateral declaration of statehood. Most importantly, Obama associated the 
U.S. fully with the importance of recognizing Israel as a democratic and Jewish state; and he spoke at some length about 
the imperative of meeting Israel's security requirements in a manner that would give Israel the confidence that it could 
defend itself by itself. 
It was thus surprising that Netanyahu reacted so swiftly and harshly to the President's speech, saying America did not 
understand Israel's situation and emphasizing that the 1967 borders are "indefensible." 
Netanyahu implied that Obama had called for Israel to withdraw to the 1967 lines —which Obama did not do — and 
repeated demands that Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state and accept an Israeli military presence along the 
Jordan River <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Jordan+River> 
Even before arriving in Washington <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Washington%2c+DC> to discuss the 
President's policy, the Prime Minister felt compelled to oppose it. 
In effect, Netanyahu's reaction to Obama's words revealed far more about the politics of the peace process in both 
countries than about the nuances of American policy. Netanyahu, like all Israelis, wants peace, but it is unclear whether 
he or his coalition wants a peace process. The prime minister has laid out a series of preconditions and demands that are 
not unreasonable as outcomes of negotiations, but effectively serve as roadblocks to getting to negotiations. 
Netanyahu has also made what can only be considered a fundamental political gaffe by seeking support for his position 
within the domestic politics of the U.S. It is both usual and acceptable for Israel or others to argue their case before the 
American people; it is quite another matter to seek to pit the opposition against the President. 
This has never worked in the past — witness then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Yitzhak+Shamin's attempt to reach over the head of President George H. W. 
Bush <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/George+H.W.+Bush> to the Congress to secure loan guarantees for Soviet 
immigrants, an effort that failed. Netanyahu has been unwise to try this again, and the Republicans 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/U.S.+Republican+Party> have been unwise to take this bait. The peace process, 
for many years immune to the partisanship that besets so much of our national discourse, has now become just another 
political pawn in the partisan squabbling between our parties. 
In all of this Israeli-American infighting, can it be assumed that the Palestinians will cheer the President's speech? Clearly 
not. Palestinians President Mahmoud Abbas <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Mahmoud+Abbas> has called an
