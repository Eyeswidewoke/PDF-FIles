the prescription drugs that can be legally marketed in the United States have not only not been approved by the FDA, 
they have never been objectively evaluated for for their basic safety and efficacy by their manufacturers or distributors. 
In 2014 US prescription drug sales exceeded $374 billion dollars. The amount spent on unsafe, unproven, and ineffective 
drugs is undoubtedly a significant portion of this total. Adding to this dangerous and wasteful expenditure are the 
financial consequences of ineffective treatment allowing disease progression, and the prohibitive expense of resulting 
morbidity and mortality. Congress and the FDA should assure that these tens of billions of dollars per year are redirected 
from unethical and wasteful practices, and instead utilized to protect the public health and safety. 
A significant number of the staggering 440,000 deaths in US hospitals each year that arise from medical 
errors are due to pharmaceutical adverse reactions or interactions. The cursory voluntary post-marketing surveillance of 
drugs is widely recognized as haphazard and inadequate, and has resulted in prohibitive and avoidable excess mortality 
and morbidity rates. One of the more recent drug approvals that was later withdrawn was in 2004 for Merck's anti-
inflammatory drug Rofecoxib (Vioxx •) which has been conservatively attributed with over 38,000 deaths in the US, and 
60,000 worldwide. The number of deaths related to Vioxx • is probably a multiple of the conservative figure. In 1999, 
the year Vioxx • was introduced, the US experienced a jump in cardiovascular deaths by an unprecedented 50,000+ 
excess deaths per year. The surge of 50,000+ deaths per year persisted until Vioxx • was withdrawn from the market in 
2004, contributing to a potential 250,000 deaths in the US alone. 
The FDA has extremely high, and arguably excessive, safety and efficacy standards for new drugs and 
generic versions of pre-1938 drugs. What is incomprehensible is that it has protected from regulatory oversight 
inappropriately grandfathered drugs for over eighty years that have no safety or efficacy data. Ironically, a generic 
version of the eighty plus year old protected pharmaceutical would require FDA regulation. FDA guidelines are in 
essence giving the grandfathered drugs not only a regulatory protection pass, but also monopoly status by creating a 
financial and regulatory barrier to the entry of generic manufacturers. 
The FDA and Congress have consistently failed to addressed this major public health and safety issue. By 
emphasis on excessive and unreasonable safety and efficacy statistical data, the expense and uncertainty of approval 
have skyrocketed drug development costs. This has hindered pharmaceutical and industry innovation, and delayed and 
prevented bringing new products and therapy to the market. The outdated grandfather status of drugs from 1938 and 
before has allowed tens of thousands of unapproved drugs to remain in the marketplace. The hundreds of billions of 
dollars spent on unproven drugs is exceeded only by the exorbitant cost in human mortality and morbidity. The numbers 
are not known, but if 250,000 Americans can be killed in only five years by one drug over that was approved by the FDA, 
imagine the numbers killed over eighty years with 88,000 unapproved drugs that were never evaluated for safety or 
efficacy. 
The FDA will require pharma to spend hundreds of millions to billions of dollars to bring a new drug to 
market, yet old ones that have been never seen even the most basic of safety studies are marketed with impunity. 
Grandfathered drugs are still marketed over eighty years after first appearing without safety or efficacy data, or any 
form of post marketing surveillance. Contrast this lack of oversight with the bureaucratic logic by which an FDA panel 
which has declined to approve a new drug for Duchene muscular dystrophy, a fatal disease of children without effective 
therapy, because the number of subjects is too small for statistical proof of safety. This is in spite of the fact that none of 
the subjects were harmed, and many had dramatic benefit. The denial of a potentially life-saving drug because of a small 
statistical and theoretical possibility of harm flies in the face of the FDA's cavalier attitude about the flood of 
grandfathered drugs with unknown safety and efficacy. 
The interaction between a subject patient and a pharmaceutical product can be summarized as falling 
into one of four categories. Only one of the four categories has an optimal outcome, where the drug is efficacious 
providing benefit, without creating an adverse reaction. A mixed result is where the drug does provide therapeutic 
benefit, but also causes an adverse reaction which may override its benefits. A relatively neutral outcome, except for the 
negative financial impact and delay in effective therapy, is where the drug is not efficacious and does not provide 
therapeutic benefit, but does not cause an adverse reaction. The worst case scenario is where there is no therapeutic 
benefit, but an adverse event occurs, potentially with significant morbidity and mortality. There is growing recognition in
