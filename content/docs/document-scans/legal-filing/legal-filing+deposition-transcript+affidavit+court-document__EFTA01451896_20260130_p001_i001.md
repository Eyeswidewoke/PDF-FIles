SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
income would otherwise be excluded as dividends, interest, gains or other similar income. 
A U.S. Tax-Exempt Investor whose interest will be debt-financed should consult with its 
tax advisors concerning the taxation of such interest under the PFIC rules that may be 
applicable to its investment in the Offshore Feeder Fund. 
The Offshore Feeder Fund will be a PFIC as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
If an investor becomes a U.S. Taxable Investor after investing in the Offshore Feeder Fund, 
the investor could become subject to the adverse tax consequences of the PFIC regime. 
Such an investor should consult its own tax advisor as to the U.S. tax implications to it of 
the PFIC rules. In addition, U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors and Investors that become U.S. 
Holders may be required to file an annual or other report with respect to the Offshore 
Feeder Fund or any portfolio company that is treated as a PFIC. 
Treasury regulations provide that tax-exempt persons generally are not subject to the 
potentially adverse effects of the PFIC rules. An investor that is a U.S. Tax-Exempt 
Investor may not make a QEF election with respect to the Offshore Feeder Fund unless the 
investor is taxable under the UBTI rules with respect to distributions received from the 
Offshore Feeder Fund (which would occur generally only if a U.S. Tax-Exempt Investor 
itself borrowed to make its investment in an interest). The Offshore Feeder Fund and the 
Fund have not committed themselves to providing the information that an investor would 
need to make a QEF election. 
A U.S. Tax-Exempt Investor that transfers cash to the Offshore Feeder Fund in exchange 
for an interest will be required to file a Form 926 or a similar form with the IRS if (1) such 
person owns immediately after the transfer at least 10% by vote or value of the Offshore 
Feeder Fund or (2) the transfer, when aggregated with all related transfers under applicable 
regulations, exceeds $100,000. In addition, U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors owning 10% or 
more of the total value of a foreign corporation such as the Offshore Feeder Fund will be 
required to file an information return with the IRS containing certain disclosure about the 
filing investor, other Investors and the Offshore Feeder Fund. The Offshore Feeder Fund 
has not committed itself to providing the information necessary to complete this return. In 
the event that a U.S. Tax-Exempt Investor that is required to file such information returns 
fails to do so, such investor could be subject to substantial penalties. Further, certain U.S. 
Tax-Exempt Investors may be subject to an excise tax if the Offshore Feeder Fund engages 
in a "prohibited tax shelter transaction" or a "subsequently listed transaction" as defined in 
Section 4965 of the Code. If the Offshore Feeder Fund engages in a prohibited tax shelter 
transaction, U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors may be subject to substantial penalties if they fail 
to comply with special disclosure requirements, and their managers may also be subject to 
substantial penalties. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors 
regarding the applicability of these rules to an investment in the Offshore Feeder Fund. 
Additional Reporting Requirements. Although Investors in the Offshore Feeder Fund 
are currently not required to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts 
('FBAR") form with the U.S. Treasury Department with respect to an investment in the 
Offshore Feeder Fund, U.S. Treasury Department has announced that it is considering 
these requirements and intends to issue regulations clarifying the application of the FBAR 
filing obligation in relation to entities such as the Offshore Feeder Fund. Under the
