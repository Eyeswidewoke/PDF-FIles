Litigation 
On December 1, 2010, the Company, along with co-founder Jim McKelvey, filed a complaint in the United States District 
Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (Civil Action No. 4:10-cv-02243) against REM Holdings 3, LLC ("REM') that. as amended, 
seeks to correct the inventorship of three patents. The patents named Robert Morley as the sole inventor and REM as their 
assignee of rights, and the Company filed suit to have Mr. McKelvey added as an inventor. REM subsequently filed counterclaims 
alleging that the Company had infringed those same three patents. The litigation was stayed pending the outcome of reexamination 
proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") with respect to the three patents. Wth the exception of five 
recently amended claims, which have not yet progressed beyond preliminary reexamination, all of the claims from the three patents 
asserted in Mr. Morley's 2010 complaint have either been canceled or otherwise found unpatentable by the Patent Office Trial and 
Appeals Board. 
On January 30, 2014, Mr. Morley and REM filed a complaint against the Company, Jack Dorsey, and Mr. McKelvey, again in 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (Civil Action No. 4:14-CV-00172), alleging that the formation of 
the Company and the development of its card reader and decoding technologies constituted, among other things, breach of an oral 
joint venture, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation of trade secrets, as well 
as other related claims. Mr. Morley also alleges infringement of an additional patent from the same family as those in the prior 
litigation, and he seeks correction of inventorship of certain of our patents. This lawsuit has now been consolidated with the prior 
litigation, and the patent-related claims have been stayed pending the outcome of PTO proceedings. 
The Company is vigorously defending against the claims of REM and Mr. Morley in both cases. Given the early stage of the 
District Court proceedings. the Company cannot reliably determine the potential liability that could result from this matter. 
On March 19, 2015. Jeffry Levin filed a putative class action lawsuit against Caviar, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Square), alleging that Caviar misclassified Mr. Levin and other similarly situated couriers as independent contractors under the 
provisions of the California Labor Code and claiming that certain expenses should have been borne by Caviar. This lawsuit was
