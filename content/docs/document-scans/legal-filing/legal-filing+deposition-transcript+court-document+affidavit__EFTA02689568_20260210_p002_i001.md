U.S. Immigration Policy on Asylum Seekers 
Summary 
The United States has long held to the principle that it will not return a foreign 
national to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened. This principle 
is embodied in several provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 
most notably in provisions defining refugees and asylees. Aliens seeking asylum 
must demonstrate a well-founded fear that if returned home, they will be persecuted 
based upon one of five characteristics: race, religion, nationality, membership in a 
particular social group, or political opinion. 
Aliens present in the United States may apply for asylum with the United States 
Citizenship and Immigration Services Bureau (USCIS) in the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) after arrival into the country, or they may seek asylum 
before a Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) 
immigration judge during removal proceedings. Aliens arriving at a U.S. port who 
lack proper immigration documents or who engage in fraud or misrepresentation are 
placed in expedited removal; however, if they express a fear of persecution, they 
receive a "credible fear" hearing with an USCIS asylum officer and — if found 
credible — are referred to an EOIR immigration judge for a hearing. 
In FY2003, there were 42,114 claims for asylum filed with USCIS, and by the 
close of the fiscal year, there were 262,102 asylum cases pending at USCIS. The 
USCIS asylum officers approved 11,434 cases in FY2003, and the percentage of 
cases approved was 29% of cases decided. Generally, over two-thirds of all asylum 
cases that EOIR received were cases referred to the immigration judges by the 
asylum officers. The percentage of EOIR asylum cases approved was 37% of cases 
decided in both FY2002 and FY2003. At the end of FY2003, there were 158,624 
cases pending for asylees to adjust to legal permanent resident (LPR) status. A person 
who receives asylum today would wait about 16 years to become an LPR. 
Although there are many who would revise U.S. asylum law and policy, those 
advocating change have divergent perspectives. Some express concern that potential 
terrorists could use asylum as an avenue for entry into the United States, especially 
aliens from trouble spots in the Mideast, northern Africa and south Asia. Others 
argue that — given the religious, ethnic, and political violence in various countries 
around the world — it is becoming more difficult to differentiate the persecuted from 
the persecutors. Some assert that asylum has become an alternative pathway for 
immigration rather than humanitarian protection provided in extraordinary cases. 
Others maintain that current law does not offer adequate protections for people 
fleeing human rights violations or gender-based abuses that occur around the world. 
At the crux is the extent an asylum policy forged during the Cold War can adapt to 
a changing world and the war on terrorism. 
Thel0r Congress enacted several bills that included asylum provisions, notably 
P.L. 108-333 and P.L. 108-458. Elimination of the cap on asylee adjustments as well 
as inclusion of asylum provisions dropped from P.L. 108-458 are now in H.R. 418 
and H.R. 1268, both of which passed the House, and a compromise version was 
retained by the conferees on H.R. 1268. This report will be updated as warranted.
