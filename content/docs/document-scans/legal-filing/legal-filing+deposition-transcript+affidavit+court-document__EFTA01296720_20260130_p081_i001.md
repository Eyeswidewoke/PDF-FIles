2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87203, * 
that was made to Main Justice or to any other District, including any documents that were 
transmitted to any other District regarding the conflict and regarding what was to be 
investigated." (DE 260 at 4). Petitioners argue that such materials are relevant because 
they "show why the victims did not receive proper notifications about the non-prosecution 
agreement that the [United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida] 
negotiated with Epstein." (DE 266 at 11). The Court concludes that the materials are not 
relevant in that regard. 
First, the Court finds that the responsive documents are shielded by governmental 
attorney-client privilege. The responsive documents are internal Department ['34] of 
Justice correspondences between attorneys for the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida and the Executive Office of United States Attorneys. (DE 212-1 
at 22-23); (see Table at P-013248-13278). One of the Executive Office's functions is to 
"[p]rovide general legal interpretations, opinions, and advice to United States Attorneys in 
areas of recusals." Offices of the United States Attorneys, United States Department of 
Justice, http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/mission-and-functions (last visited June 19, 
2015). The internal documents that Petitioners seek relate to the provision of legal advice 
by the Executive Office to the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
Florida regarding how to proceed in the Epstein matter given the initiation of CVRA 
litigation by Petitioners. These communications are solely between attorneys within the 
United States Department of Justice. The communications do not constitute the 
commission of crime, fraud, or misconduct, but rather simply advise how to proceed given 
that allegations of misconduct have been made, i.e., allegations that the Government 
violated the victims' CVRA rights. 
Moreover, the documents related to the recusal determination are not relevant to ['35] 
matters conceming whether the Government violated Petitioners' CVRA rights several 
years before. Petitioners speculate that the reason that the Southern District recused "may 
have to do with the Office's treatment of the victims." (DE 266 at 12). The Court has 
reviewed the recussal materials, and they do not indicate that the Office had to step away 
from the Epstein matter because of its handling of victims' notifications, but rather because 
of the perceived conflict that would exist if the Office continued to investigate Epstein after 
the institution of CVRA litigation by Petitioners. The recusal materials have no relevancy to 
anything that occurred prior to the institution of the instant litigation by Petitioners. 
5. Request No. 19--Materials Related to Defense's Assault on Prosecution 
In request number 19, Petitioners seek all documents supporting, or contradicting, a 
statement made by a United States Attorney to the media that Epstein launched "a 
yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors." (DE 260 at 4). After its in 
camera review, the Court has not identified any documents that are responsive to this 
request that are not otherwise protected opinion work product. No ['36] production under 
this request is necessary. 
6. Request No. 25--Initial Disclosures under FRCP 26(01) 
Finally, Petitioners request that the Government comply with its obligation to serve initial 
disclosures under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1). Although Petitioners have
