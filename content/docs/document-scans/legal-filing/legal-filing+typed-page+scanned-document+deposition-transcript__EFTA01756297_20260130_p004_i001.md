(Although it is also the case that Argentina, Brazil, Germany, .1-pan, and the Netherlands have domestic enrichment 
capabilities while remai=ing compliant with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.) 
But while a permanent end to Iranian enrichment would be ideal, it is also =ighly unrealistic. The Iranian regime has 
invested enormous amounts of pol=tical capital and billions of dollars over decades to master the knowledge=and 
centrifuge technology associated with uranium enrichment -- and nothin= will put that genie back in the bottle. Indeed, 
one is hard pressed to fi=d a single bona fide Iran expert on the planet that believes Tehran would =ccept a diplomatic 
deal with the P5+1 that zeroed out enrichment for all t=me. 
And here's six reasons why: 
1. Backing an end to enrichment would be political suicide for Rouhani. 
Iran's new president simply can't agree to permanently end enrichment. In 2=03, during his previous role as Iran's chief 
nuclear negotiator, he convin=ed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to accept a temporary suspension =f 
enrichment. But further talks with the international community stalled i= early 2005 over a failure to agree on Iran's 
right to enrichment, and Teh=an ended its suspension shortly thereafter. Rouhani believes -- as do his =ritics in the 
Revolutionary Guard and the supreme leader -- that the West =ocketed Iranian concessions and Tehran got nothing in 
return. The failure =f Iran's earlier approach under Rouhani facilitated the rise of Mahmoud Ah=adinejad and his 
hardline policies, including the development of a much mo=e robust uranium enrichment capability. Rouhani is unlikely 
to make that m=stake again. And even if Rouhani were somehow convinced to do so, he would=be savaged by his right 
flank, significantly undercutting his presidency. 
2. It's a matter of pride and principle for the regime. 
The regime has invested far too much of its domestic legitimacy in defendin= Iran's "rights" (defined as domestic 
enrichment) to completely capitulate=now, regardless of the pressure. The nuclear program and "resistance to ar=ogant 
powers" are firmly imbedded in the Islamic Republic's ideological ra=son d'etre. Khamenei, the ultimate decider on the 
nuclear file, and the Re=olutionary Guards will not give up on the program altogether, for it could=be a viewed by their 
supporters and opponents alike as a total defeat. 
However, Khamenei may accept a deal that constrains Iran's nuclear program =ut still allows limited enrichment. Under 
such an agreement, he could tell=the Iranian people: "I said we never wanted nuclear weapons and I have iss=ed a fatwa 
(religious ruling] against them. I insisted that our rights be =espected, and now they are." But if Khamenei cries uncle 
and dismantles th= entire program, how will he explain the billions invested and justify the=years of sanctions and 
isolation to his people? What would it all have bee= for? Khamenei likely fears such a humiliation more than he fears 
economic=collapse or targeted military strikes against his nuclear facilities. 
3. If Iran does want to go nuclear, sanctions aren't going to stop it in ti=e. 
Although hawks believe Tehran is on the ropes and that additional sanctions=can force Iran to completely dismantle its 
nuclear program, economic and n=clear timelines don't align. To be sure, Iran's economy is in dire straits= and a desire 
to alleviate the pressure is driving the regime's apparent w=llingness to negotiate more seriously. But despite the 
current pain, Iran =s not facing imminent economic collapse. This may be a dark period in Tehr=n, but Khamenei likely 
believes that Iran weathered worse times during the=Iran-Iraq war. Some analysts have warned that Iran could achieve a 
critica= "breakout capability" -- the ability to produce fissile material for nucl=ar weapons so fast that it could not be 
detected or stopped -- sometime in=mid-2014. Yet, even if the U.S. Congress goes forward with additional hars= 
sanctions, the regime is not likely to implode before it reaches this tec=nical threshold and, if it did, it might make little 
difference. Even the =mprisoned leadership of the Green Movement and Iranian secularists opposed=to the Islamic 
Republic support domestic uranium enrichment. The only way =o stop a breakout capability is to get a deal, fast -- and 
that means acce=ting some limited enrichment under strict safeguards. 
4. Washington is still an effective bogeyman. 
Khamenei likely believes that Rouhani's election and the Iranian president'= new moderate tone provide sufficient 
domestic and international credibili=y to mitigate the downside risks of failed diplomacy. Congress could attem=t to 
force Tehran to accept maximalist demands by increasing sanctions, bu= the supposed mechanism for pressure affecting 
Iranian calculations is the=regime's fear of popular unrest. Yet, if P5+1 negotiations are seen to fai= because of 
Washington's insistence on zero enrichment, the Iranian public=is likely to blame the United Sates not the regime for the 
failure. Econom=c pressure on the regime may increase as a result, but popular pressure to=change course may not. 
5. Pressure will become less effective if the United States comes off as th= intransigent party. 
If talks collapse because of Washington's unwillingness to make a deal on e=richment -- a deal Russia and China and 
numerous other European and Asian =ations support -- it will also become harder to enforce sanctions. Whether=or not
