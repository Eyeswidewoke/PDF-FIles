This sometimes involves a plea of nolo contendere to avoid civil liability. The 
offender may make public statements that he is pleading guilty because he does 
not want to put the children through the trauma of having to testify or has no 
more money to defend himself. In some cases offenders claimed they pleaded 
guilty because they knew a jury would convict them, but they "could not 
remember committing the crime." This problem is compounded by the fact that 
it is possible, under the provisions of a U.S. Supreme Court decision (North Caro-
lina a Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 1970), for an offender to plead guilty to a charge while 
at the same time not acknowledge that he committed the crime. Although it is 
understandable why a prosecutor might accept such a plea in some cases, its use 
prevents the offender from having to accept public responsibility for his behav-
ior. He is able to plead in essence "guilty, but not guilty" and further confuse the 
child victim as to who is guilty and innocent. 
Another variation of this is that the child molester pleads not guilty by reason 
of insanity. If state insanity criteria allow it, he will claim he knew his acts were 
wrong, but he lacked the ability to conform his behavior to the law. The judge 
and jury will then be given the difficult task of differentiating between an irresist-
ible impulse and an impulse not resisted. When other tactics fail the child 
molester may claim some type of mental illness. It is interesting to note that few 
child molesters admit mental illness until relatives, friends, or neighbors identify 
them; law enforcement identifies and arrests them; or other tactics fail and the 
courts convict them. If, as previously discussed, all pedophiles are not necessarily 
child molesters, then pedophilia alone cannot be the cause of their child molest-
ing. Such mental-health defenses rarely work during a trial, but can be more 
effective at sentencing. 
The real battle then takes place at sentencing where sex offenders effectively 
play the "sick and sympathy" game. In this game the offender expresses deep 
regret and attempts to show he is a pillar of the community, a devoted family 
man, a military veteran, a churchgoer/leader, nonviolent, without prior arrests, 
and a victim of abuse with many personal problems. They get the courts to feel 
sorry for them by claiming they are hard-working "nice guys" or decorated 
career military men who have been humiliated and lost everything. In view of the 
fact that many people still believe in the myth that child molesters are evil weirdos 
or social misfits, this tactic can unfortunately be effective especially at sentencing. 
Many traits introduced by the offender as evidence of his good character (e.g., 
dedication to children, volunteer work, conducting child-sex-abuse prevention 
programs, offers to assist law enforcement) in fact contribute to his ability to 
access and seduce children and/or rationalize his behavior. 
In addition some seduced victims do not want the perpetrator prosecuted or 
sent to prison. At sentencing they may even write a letter to the judge indicating 
their "consent" in the sexual activity and expressing their love for the defendant. 
Should such a letter get the same consideration as a letter from a victim request-
ing harsh punishment? 
Although convicted of a sex offense, they will sometimes produce forensic 
mental-health evaluations that will diagnose no sexual disorders. The diagnosis of 
numerous mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disor-
der, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), personality disorders, and "Internet 
addiction syndrome" is often introduced as mitigating circumstances for consid-
eration in the sentencing phase of the case. If there is a diagnosis of one or more
