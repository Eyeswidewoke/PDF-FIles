Sheikh Sabah's pursuit a= a peacemaker is only matched by his humanitarian efforts to 
alleviate human suffering around the world. Test=ment to this is the designation of the Amir as a Humanitarian Leader, 
and Kuwait a= a Global Humanitarian Centre. Sheikh Sabah hosted three Syria aid conference= in Kuwait, where donor 
countries pledged a total of approximately $20 billio= dollars to support the plight of millions of Syrian refugees. And as I 
understand, your country, Norway, has participated in the organisation of th= third conference in the United Kingdom. 
Kuwait itself has been the third largest donor following the United States and the United Kingdom. 
This is quite impressive, given t=e small geographical size of Kuwait, that under the 
leadership of Sheikh Sabah, it has become the=world's largest donor to humanitarian aid in terms of its level as 
p=rcentage of GDP, standing at 1.3 per cent. Most of this aid is channelled through the=United Nations and its various 
organisations, which understand more than any=ne else how valuable and indispensable this reliable support is to our 
troubled=world, when many nations started to feel donors' fatigue. 
Other than emergency relief, She=kh Sabah has also looked at the long-term interest of 
poorer countries. The Kuwait Fund for Economic Development, which the Amir supervises, has extended loans on 
concessionary term totalling over $19 billion to finance development projects in 106 countries. The well-balanced 
foreign policy that Sheikh Sabah put in place, which focuses on assistance, support and respect, is one of the main 
reasons=why such a large alliance of world nations came together to liberate Kuwait f=om the Iraqi invasion in 1990. It 
appears that the good deeds that Kuwait and i=s Amir have done to the world had paid back. 
Contributing simultaneously to g=obal emergency relief and resolution of conflicts, on 
the one hand, and supporting the development=of poorer nations, 
on the other, Sheikh Sabah has d=monstrated that he has a firm understanding that 
reducing the gap between poor and rich countries is a=main catalyst for the reduction of conflicts and world peace. =/p> 
In his home country, Sheikh Saba= was behind two major reforms with far-reaching 
consequences. During his tenure as prime minister in 2005,=a law was passed giving women in Kuwait suffrage rights for 
the first time. Wi=hin weeks after that law was passed, he appointed the first woman minister in hi= cabinet. As Amir of 
Kuwait he ratified a number of legislations in 2006, including the Publications Act, which opened the door for numerous 
media organisations to obtain licenses and operate. Kuwait was soon ranked the top=country in the Middle East in 
"Reporters Without Borders" Press Freedom Index. 
Restrictions were also lifted on=licensing of public-benefit associations and civic society 
organisations. This also helpe= to revive cultural life and led to the opening of several theatres, an opera=house and 
cultural centres, and it greatly added to the cultural richness an= tolerant environment of the City of Kuwait, where 
people from more than 120 nationalities live, and where worshippers of different faiths go to their respective mosques 
or churches to pray, which is not very common for countri=s in the region.
