Pre-existing Fiduciar, or 
Contractual Obilinitions 
Mr. DiCamillo will be required to present all business 
opportunities which arc suitable for Universal Trailer 
Corp. to it prior to presenting them to us. 
Mr. DiCantillo will be required to present all business 
opportunities which are suitable for Select Staffing 
Corp. to it prior to presenting them to us. 
Mr. Anthos will be required to present all business 
opportunities which are suitable for Eaglepoint 
Advisors to it prior to presenting them to us. 
However, he believes that as a consulting firm it is 
not itself in the business of engaging in business 
combinations, and thus he believes there will be no 
conflicts with us 
Accordingly, if any of the above executive officers, directors or director nominees becomes aware of a 
business combination opportunity which is suitable for any of the above entities to which he or she has then 
current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to 
present such business combination opportunity to such entity. and only present it to us if such entity rejects the 
opportunity. We do not believe, however, that any of the foregoing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations will 
materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director 
unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of 
our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would 
otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with 
members of our management team or their affiliates. In the event we seek to complete our initial business 
combination with a company that is affiliated with any member of our management team or their affiliates, we. or 
a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an 
independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA that our initial business combination is fair to 
our company from a financial point of view. 
In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, our initial 
stockholder has agreed to vote its founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the offering in 
favor of our initial business combination and our officers. directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote 
any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, 
we would need only 5,062,501 of the 13.500.000 public shares. or 37.5%, sold in this offering to be voted in favor 
of our initial business combination in order to have such transaction approved (assuming the over-allotment 
option is not exercised and no shares arc purchased by such parties in this offering). 
Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our officers, directors and director 
nominees will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in 
the future be amended. In addition, our amended and restated 
112 
certificate of incorporation will provide that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us 
for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation 
thereof is not permitted by the DGCL. 
We will enter into agreements with ow officers, directors and director nominal to provide contractual 
indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation. Our bylaws also permit us to maintain insurance on behalf of any officcr, director or employee for 
any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such 
indemnification. We will purchase a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance that insures our officers, 
directors and director nominees against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some
