SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Limited Partners (which are greater than the management fees payable by investors in the 
Master Fund). Investors should read this entire Memorandum (including the Appendices), 
the Onshore Feeder LP Agreement and the Offshore Feeder LP Agreement, as applicable, 
and should consult with their legal, tax and financial advisors regarding the risks and 
conflicts of interest involved in an investment in a Feeder Fund. 
The Master Fund Offering Memorandum contains a more detailed and comprehensive 
summary of the risks associated with an investment in the Master Fund. Because the sole 
purpose of the Onshore Feeder Fund is to acquire an interest in the Master Fund, the 
underlying investment opportunity is in the Master Fund and all of the risk factors and 
disclosures of potential conflicts set forth in the Master Fund Offering Memorandum will 
be relevant when considering an investment in a Feeder Fund. Therefore, prospective 
Investors must also carefully review the Master Fund Offering Memorandum, 
including the more detailed and comprehensive summary of risks related to an 
investment in the Master Fund in Section 8: "Risk Factors" before making a 
commitment to a Feeder Fund. 
General Risk Factors 
Recent Developments in the U.S. and Global Financial Markets. The ongoing turmoil 
in the U.S. and global financial markets has illustrated that the current environment is one 
of extraordinary and unprecedented uncertainty and instability. A number of high-profile 
and significant transactions and events have occurred with respect to participants in the 
financial services industry, including the failure or forced sale of certain banks, investment 
banks and other financial services businesses and broad scale market intervention by 
governments in the United States and abroad, and economic and financial market 
conditions have significantly deteriorated as compared to prior periods. Global financial 
markets have experienced considerable and prolonged declines in the valuations of equity 
and debt securities and an acute contraction in the availability of credit. As a result, certain 
government bodies and central banks worldwide, including the U.S. Treasury Department 
and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, have undertaken unprecedented intervention 
programs, the effects of which remain uncertain. The U.S. economy has experienced and 
continues to experience significant declines in employment, household wealth and lending 
and the global credit markets continue to experience substantial disruption, liquidity 
shortages and financial instability. Moreover, recent events may indicate that recovery 
from the recession may be more prolonged. In particular, U.S. financial and global 
markets have experienced high levels of volatility surrounding the downgrade of the 
United States' long-term sovereign credit rating by Standard & Poor's from AAA to AA+, 
and certain other macroeconomic events that have been well publicized, including 
difficulties of certain European Union member states to service their sovereign debt 
obligations. Because of the unprecedented nature of these events, the ultimate impacts on 
global markets are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent, and may adversely 
affect the Feeder Funds, the Master Fund and their investments.
