Good question 
Not really 
The medical space is so filled - it honestly doesn't feel like a space for innovation. People talk a lot but the 
regulatory environment and intense competition for resources to support well established labs makes it hard to 
make progress. 
I enjoy spending time in the hospitals, learning about stuff. The cases have a beginning and an end (move on to 
the next one), the leaming is challenging. Using skills and making decisions where I am accountable is terrific. 
While there is always room for improvement and tons of input from folks all over the hospital - doctors largely 
make autonomous decisions where there are real outcomes. Nothing fake or intangible. And it feels like a merit-
based place in the sense that the gossip and politics are secondary to the patient care (and not the primary 
drivers of it). There is also no cult of a supreme leader or head of state that makes emotional and often all 
ecmpassing decisions (unless it is God). I like neurology and neurosurgery both and I plan to continue to carve 
out a cool hybrid role that manages both specifically with expertise in trauma and cerebrovascular pathology 
since that is where I have lots of training and experience. 
There are a ton of really cool research questions that no one will fund. I'm not sure even how to answer the 
questions but if they were provable, they would be game changing. I've tried to get research grants but basically 
unless you are doing genomics or degenerative disease - there really isn't much to qualify for. Setting up a lab is 
also a bogus operation since you don't really need all the space/people but the university needs that to keep 
funding flowing. So the "dean's tax" is a huge barrier too. 
There is an offer on the table in the private sector at a big hospital here called 
where they want 
me to run their vascular fellowship and be a neurosurgical hospitalist (neurology + neurosurgery inpatient only, no 
clinic). But it is a real commitment and so bureaucratic/academic - not creative and a step in a direction that I am 
not keen to take.

Since you are in the hospital doing surgery two or three times a night , for two weeks. , isn't there 
something that is an offshoot of medicine that you are passsionate about
