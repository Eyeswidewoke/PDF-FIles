The authors did not examine the impact of a cou=try achieving zero inequality (something that would come close to 
idealized communism), b=t used inequality levels and economic growth in 1990 as their reference, whic= they compared 
to data from 2010. The wealth gap in OECD countries is now at its highest level since 30 years, as this chart below 
shows. (Inequality is measured with a Gini coefficient which ranges from zero to one. Zero =quals maximum equality, 
whereas one stands for maximum inequality. Chart: OECD, Focus on Inequality and Growth Report) 
Economically, the authors are parti=ularly worried about the gap between low-income households and the rest of the 
population. =quot;ln contrast, no evidence is found that those with high incomes pulling away fr=m the rest of the 
population harms growth," the authors wrote. ="Since 2008, the argument that inequality is causing economic losses 
has gained st=am. But the fact that this study was released by the OECD has surprised me,&quo=; Dean Baker, co-
director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, tol= The Washington Post. Particularly before the financial 
crisis, many economi=ts considered inequality as a useful corollary to economic growth -- an assump=ion the recent 
OECD study tries to rebuke. 
Here=are the countries that missed out on most growth, according to the OECD: 
</=> 
1. New Zealand: New Zealand'= economy could have grown by 44 percent between 1990 and 2010, but the country did 
only achieve=28 percent growth due to inequality. Hence, it lost 15.5 percentage points -- more than any other country. 
This i= particularly surprising, given that New Zealand was once considered a paradise of equality, as Max Rashbrooke, 
=he author of a book called Inequality: A New Zealand Crisis, pointed out in th= Guardian newspaper. "New Zealand 
halved its top tax rate, cut=benefits by up to a quarter of their value, and dramatically reduced the bargaining power 
Q=80$ and therefore the share of national income — of ordinary workers. Thous=nds of people lost their jobs as 
manufacturing work went overseas, and there was n= significant response with increased trade training or skills 
programs, a po=icy failure that is ongoing," Rashbrooke writes in the op-ed. He=also blames New Zealand for a lack of 
AFFORDABLE HOMES which led to higher rents and unpaid mortgages.

2. Mexico: Among all 21 examined OECD countries, Mexico has the highest level of inequality and missed out on 11 
percent of potential economic growth, according to the Gini coefficient, a commonly us=d measurement method. In 
May, photographer Oscar Ruiz captured Mexico's inequality in aerial footage. The subtitle=that accompanies the photos 
reads: "This image has not been modified. It's time to change that."=/p> 
c=pan style="font-size:12ptline-height:107%;font-family:Georgia,serir>3.=/span> Britain, Finland and Norway: These 
countries missed out on nearly 9 percentage points of economic growth. While Br=tain is among the OECD's most 
unequal countries, Finland and Norway had low inequality levels in 1990 and CONTINU=D to do so in 2010. 
Nevertheless, inequality increased in both Scandinavian countries (and particularly in Finland).' 
4. United States= Italy and Sweden: Between six and seven percentage points of potential growth were knocked off by 
inequal=ty between 1990 and 2010. The report does not offer individual explanations wh= those countries rank among 
the nations that are hardest hit. Spain, F=ance and Ireland, however, are the only countries that did not miss out on 
economic growth. According to=the authors of the study, all three countries have decreased or maintained the extent
