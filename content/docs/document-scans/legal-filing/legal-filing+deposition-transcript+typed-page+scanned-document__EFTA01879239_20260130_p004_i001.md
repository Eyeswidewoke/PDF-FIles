crisis of 2008 was ultimately the result of unethical, 'casino' behaviour on the trading floor. 
Whatever failings banks might have exhibited in their ethical standards here, the reality is that the 
banking crisis had its roots in poor lending and risk standards, and poor management of loan book 
funding, rather than wild gambles or duplicity in the securities markets. The Vickers Commission 
explicitly recognised this by focusing on raising capital standards at the retail banks that make up 
the backbone of the British credit system. 
Recent huge losses in the Chief Investment Office at.' P Morgan and conduct like that of Barclays' 
traders have made this distinction far too subtle to insist upon politically. This may not matter 
much in regulatory terms — regulators have already embarked on a wide range of securities markets 
reforms. But it will help embed the persistent political idea that retail banking is inherently 'safe' 
while investment banking and securities markets business is inherently 'risky'. To which recent 
events have added the taint of suspect ethical conduct. 
For universal bank leaders who have come out of the securities world, this is likely to be part of the 
challenge of dealing with politicians and regulators over the next few years. Politicians actively 
questioned Mr Diamond's credentials to lead a retail bank when he was appointed Barclays CEO in 
2011. His departure leaves an even greater burden on universal bank leaders to understand the 
growing political gap between the skillset desired of retail bank management and the caricature of 
the men and women who make a living on the trading desks. Mr Diamond maintained a glass office 
on the trading floor at Barcap even after his transition to leadership of Barclays; a gesture heavy 
with meaning for his critics. 
Mr Diamond's instincts were to close this gap by championing a 'citizenship' agenda for Barclays. 
The main problem with this is not the agenda, or the work that was done by the bank in its name. It 
was the persistent undermining of this message by the perceived conduct of the bank itself. Not just 
questions of culture and character raised by the admission that traders had sought to manipulate 
LIBOR rates for personal and institutional profit and the mis-selling of payments insurance and 
interest rate hedges for small businesses. But also fundamental questions over the bank's business 
model, the way it rewards its highest earners including Mr Diamond himself, its approach to its own 
tax affairs and the 'aggressiveness' of the tax services it provides to clients, irrespective of their 
legality. In this, obviously Barclays is far from alone. 
Politicians are at something of a loss as to how concretely to address these issues of values and 
character and this poses a particular challenge for banks. Culture is hard to regulate and the public 
have no real appetite or patience for reassurances that a renewed rigour from supervisors will fix 
the problem. The proxies for culture are going to be pay and senior accountability, and these are the 
two things that ultimately tripped up Mr Diamond at Barclays. Although many in banking would like 
to argue that these things are beside the point, politically they are the point. 
Like much else in the current banking model, the case for remuneration levels in banking is based 
purely on the logic and discipline of the free market for financial services. Yet the bailouts of 2008 
and the LIBOR-fixing scandal have further exhausted political and regulatory patience with the idea 
that banking exists in a free market. High levels of remuneration are also glaringly at odds with the 
wider economic context and the prevailing political climate. George Osborne, the British Chancellor, 
has tried to accommodate London-based investment banks by resisting the rather rigid rules 
inserted at the last minute by the European Parliament into the European CRD4 Directive applying 
ratios for fixed and bonus pay at European banks. But in doing so he is well aware that he is badly 
out of step with the public mood. 
The accountability problem is as simple and blunt as politics gets. The massive market disruptions of 
2008 and the ensuing economic crisis have created a latent political desire for personal 
accountability from the banking industry that it has so far been unable to meet. In part this is 
because the most egregiously managed institutions in the period leading up to 2008 have simply
