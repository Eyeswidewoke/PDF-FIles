Science Philanthropist, Jeffrey Epstein, Backs the First Free Thinking Robots 
Robots are quickly evolving from direction driven machines to free thinking, non-deterministic humanoids, thanks 
to an ingenious group of artificial intelligence scientists front Hong Kong and Texas; and to the funding of a 
prominent New York science investor, called Jeffrey Epstein. 
For a long time, robots looked largely like clunky machines that relied on deterministic algorithmic pathways. 
Over the last decade however. Hanson Robotics, based in Richardson, Texas, has revolutionized the appearance of 
robots with responsive facial expressions, synthetized rubber skin, called frubber and delicate features. 
Collaborator, Mark Tilden, creator of BEAM robotics and the WowWee Robosapien humanoid robot, has also 
produced complex robotic movements from analog logic circuits, discrete electronic components, and usually 
without a microprocessor. And to fill their heads, artificial intelligence group, OpenCog has stepped in to give 
these humanoid sculptures, a brain. 
Based in Hong Kong, OpenCog, an open source AI programming group, under the direction of Ben Goertzel, 
began their cerebral project with a Hanson Robokind: a toddler like robot. The challenge is to take the basic 
intelligence of virtual avatars programmed for the screen, and transfer that to a robotic structure. To do this 
however, a robot must have the capacity to perceive and interpret the outside world. 
To a large extent, OpenCog's virtual characters have that capacity: for example, each character has a database 
called an AtomSpacc where thousands of 'atoms' exist as knowledge concepts such as objects, actions and feelings 
(anger, fear, happiness). Every time a character spatially encounters objects or concepts in its environment, a new 
atom is duplicated in that character's Atomspace. Associations arc also recorded as a character moves front one 
concept to another. Upon repetition, associative links get stronger, influencing a character's pathway choices and 
building associative memory. Links can also decay over time if not used by algorithms. 
Generalized intelligence from the environment is also built as similarities between concepts trigger an associative 
network in the AtomSpace. Indeed, several algorithms can function at the same time: such as current associative 
links and associative networks that are triggered due to similarities. The theory behind this "cognitive synergy" is 
that humans have multiple thought processes going on simultaneously, prioritizing one's over others in order to 
function. 
Virtual characters also have basic needs programmed into them which can get depleted or filled by interaction with 
the environment. The status of a need has a significant impact on which pathways a character chooses to take. For 
example, if the need for water is high, a character will prioritize a water atom in its pathway choice. 
"The challenge in all of this," Jeffrey Epstein remarked, who funds the project along with the Hong Kong 
Innovation in Technology Fund, "is to create a robotic nervous system that can perceive concepts in its 
environment as effectively as virtual avatars." To date. Jeffrey Epstein's foundation, the Jeffrey Epstein VI 
Foundation plays an active role in supporting neuroscience around the world. In addition to establishing the 
Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard. the foundation is one of the largest funders of individual
