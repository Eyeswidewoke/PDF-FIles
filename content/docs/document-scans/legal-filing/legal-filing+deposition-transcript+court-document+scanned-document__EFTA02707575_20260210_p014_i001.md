Other Intangible Assets — Other intangible assets consist of customer lists, contract rights, 
accreditations, proprietary curricula, covenants not to compete, trade names, and trademarks. Other 
intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
lives. The Company reviews and evaluates the remaining useful lives of such assets if events or changes 
in circumstances require impairment testing and/or a revision to the remaining period of amortization. 
Any such impairment analysis is based on a comparison of the carrying values to expected future cash 
flows. 
Other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more 
frequently, if circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed their fair values. If the carrying amount 
exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to 
reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value. 
There was no impairment of other intangible assets in fiscal years 2011 or 2010. 
Long-Lived Assets — The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets, other than goodwill 
and other intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value of assets may not be recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows. Any 
impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying values of such assets exceed their fair 
value (based on discounted cash flows). Impairment losses related to child care center property and 
equipment totaled $19.3 million for 2011 and $10.2 million for 2010. The impairment charges are 
included as a component of depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Financial Instruments — In accordance with reporting and disclosure requirements of ASC 825-10, 
Financial Instruments, the Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this 
information in the Company's notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different 
than the book value of those financial instruments. When fair value is equal to book value, no disclosure 
is made. 
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued 
compensation, and related expenses and other accrued liabilities, excluding derivatives, approximate fair 
value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 
The Company's derivatives include an interest rate swap agreement, an interest rate cap agreement, and 
a four-year forward currency hedge based on the British pound. These instruments are recognized in the 
consolidated balance sheets at fair value. None of these instruments have been designated as a hedge of 
specific underlying interest rate exposure and marked to market with the resulting gains or losses 
recognized as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Changes in 
the foreign currency hedge are included as a component of gains and losses on investments. 
Deferred Financing Costs — Included in other assets are deferred financing costs incurred in 
connection with the issuance of debt. Deferred financing costs are amortized over the lives of the related 
debt facilities using a method that approximates the effective interest method. Deferred financing costs 
are recorded in other assets (see Note 11). 
Income Taxes — The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under 
this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future consequences of 
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. If it is more likely than not that some portion or 
all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the amount 
of that deferred tax asset to the amount, more likely than not, to be recognized. Uncertain tax positions 
and the related interest and penalties are recognized in other liabilities and income tax expense (see 
Note 20).
