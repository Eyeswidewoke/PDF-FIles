Jibril Rajoub, Head of the PA Supreme Council for Sport and Yo=th Affairs recently expressed total support for 
Palestinian terror which h=s murdered 22 Israelis and injured 215 in the last two months, stressing:<=span> 
"I congratulate everyone who carried them =ut (i.e., terror attacks). I say to you, we are proud of you." 
[Official PA TV, Oct. 17,=20151 
However, Rajoub added that Palestinians must be careful not to=carry out suicide terror in Tel Aviv, not because killing 
Israelis that wa= is wrong, but because the international community rejects and condemns it= Rajoub recommended 
that Palestinians murder only those Israelis whose mur=er the international community will accept as legitimate targets 
- the "se=tlers and soldiers" who are killed because they are "at the wrong time and=in the wrong place." Rajoub 
essentially instructs murderers of Israelis to=make sure they murder the right ones:

"The international community does not agre= to a bus exploding in Tel Aviv. But the international community does not 
=sk what happens to a settler or soldier in the occupied territories at the=wrong time and in the wrong place. No one 
asks about him! Therefore, we=want to fight in such a way that the world and the international community=will remain 
by our side."

According to Rajoub, it is the international community's messa=e to the PA, possibly through its silence, that it accepts 
stabbing and sh=oting murders of Israeli soldiers and civilians in Jerusalem and the West =ank, which enables the PA 
leadership to continue promoting murder. Clearly= the international community shares in the moral responsibility for 
the cu=rent murder wave if this is how the PA leadership perceives their standpoi=t. According to Rajoub, if the 
international community were to send the ex=licit message to the PA that it "does not agree" to any=PA terror 
anywhere, the PA would be forced to stop so that "the internatio=al community will remain by our side."
