full text of our code of business conduct and ethics will be posted on the investor relations page on our website. We intend to 
disclose any amendments to our code of business conduct and ethics, or waivers of its requirements, on our website or in filings 
under the Exchange Act. 
Election and Classification of Board of Directors 
Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors. Pursuant to our current certificate of 
incorporation and our amended and restated voting agreement, our directors were elected as follows: 
Messrs. Dorsey, McKelvey. Khosla, and Johnson and Drs. Summers and Simmons were elected as the designees 
nominated by holders of our common stock; 
Mr. Botha was elected as the designee nominated by holders of our Series B convertible preferred stock; 
• Ms. Meeker was elected as the designee nominated by holders of our Series C convertible preferred stock; and 
• Mr. Viniar was elected as a designee nominated by holders of a majority of each of our common stock and our convertible 
preferred stock. 
In connection with this offering, the provisions of our amended and restated voting agreement relating to the election of our 
directors will terminate and our current certificate of incorporation by which our directors were elected, along with our 
151 
Table of Contents 
bylaws, will be amended and restated. After the completion of this offering, the number of directors will be fixed by our board of 
directors, subject to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. Each of 
our current directors will continue to serve as a director until the election and qualification of his or her successor, or until his or her 
earlier death, resignation, or removal. 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors will be divided into three classes 
with staggered three-year terms. Only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, with the other 
classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. Our current directors will be divided among the three 
classes as follows: 
• the Class I directors will be Messrs. Dorsey, Johnson, and Viniar, and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of 
stockholders to be held in 2016: 
• the Class II directors will be Messrs. Botha and McKelvey and Dr. Simmons, and their terms will expire at the annual 
meeting of stockholders to be held in 2017; and 
• the Class III directors will be Ms. Meeker and Dr. Summers, and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of 
stockholders to be held in 2018. 
At each annual meeting of stockholders, upon the expiration of the term of a class of directors, the successor to each such 
director in the class will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following his or 
her election and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies, in accordance with our certificate of incorporation. Any 
additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as 
nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of our directors. 
This classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our company. 
Director independence 
Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each 
director concerning his or her background, employment, and affiliations, our board of directors has determined that Ms. Meeker, 
Messrs. Botha, Johnson, and Viniar, and Drs. Simmons and Summers, do not have relationships that would interfere with the 
exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is "independent" 
as that term is defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the New York Stock
