2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
(Id., 1146.) 
The Plaintiff alleges that, despite the foregoing, the Defendants failed to disclose 
Specialty's precarious financial condition and misrepresented that Specialty was financially 
sound. (Id., ¶¶ 64, 74.) 
F. Claims asserted in the TAC. 
The Plaintiff asserts thirteen counts in the TAC. (Doc. 64.) In Counts I and II, the Plaintiff 
asserts breach of contract claims against BTU, only. (Id. at 30-31.) In Count III, the Plaintiff 
asserts fraudulent misrepresentation claims against all the Defendants pursuant to 
sections 6-5-101 and 6-5-103 of the Code of Alabama. (Id. at 31-43.) In N 3] Count IV, 
the Plaintiff asserts fraudulent suppression claims against all the Defendants pursuant to 
section 6-5-102. (Id. at 43-49.) In Count V, the Plaintiff asserts fraudulent deceit claims 
against all the Defendants pursuant to section 6-5-104. (Id. at 49-55.) In Count VI, the 
Plaintiff asserts fraud in the inducement claims against all the Defendants. (Id. at 55-58.) In 
Count VII, the Plaintiff asserts fraud in insolvency claims against BTU and Brito pursuant to 
section 13A-9-48 of the Code of Alabama. (Id. at 58-65.) In Counts VIII-IX, the Plaintiff 
asserts negligence and wantonness claims against BIC. (Id. at 65-73.) In Counts X-XI, the 
Plaintiff asserts breach of fiduciary duty claims against BIC. (Id. at 73-81.) In Count XII, the 
Plaintiff asserts that the corporate veil should be pierced as to Bunkering and BTU so that 
the Plaintiff may recover against Brito personally. (Id. at 82-84.) In Count XIII, mislabeled 
as Count XI, the Plaintiff asserts a claim for injunctive relief against BTU and Brito. (Id. at 
84-87.) 
BTU and Brito moved to dismiss Counts IV and VII for failure to state a claim, and moved 
to strike Count VI as redundant.' (Doc. 67.) BIC moved to dismiss all Counts asserted 
against BIC (Counts 
VIII-XI) for failure to state a claim. (Doc. 65.) Counts I, II, XII 
and XIII are not addressed in the ['14] motions to dismiss and, thus, they are not 
discussed herein. 
5 BTU and Brito indicate in one sentence on the first page of their motion to dismiss that Cotrit V1 should be dismissed for 
failure to state a claim. (Doc. 67,1 1.) However, in their bnef they provide no argument regarding the dismissal of Court VI for 
failure to state a claim and failed to even reassert the statement made on the face of their motion. (Doc. 67-1.) The only 
discussion of Court VI relates to their argument that it should be stricken as redundant of other claims. (1d. at 5.) Accordingly, 
with respect to Count VI, the undersigned construes BTU and Bates motion as asserting the redundancy argument, only. 
II. Motion to Dismiss Standard 
Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a defendant may move 
to dismiss a complaint on the basis that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which 
relief may be granted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion questions the 
legal sufficiency of a complaint (or portions of a complaint); therefore, in assessing the 
merits of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must assume that all the factual allegations set 
forth in the complaint are true. See, e.g., United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 327, 111 
S. Ct. 1267, 1276, 113 L. Ed. 2d 335 (1991); Powell v. Lennon, 914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th 
Cir. 1990). Moreover, all factual allegations are to be construed in the light most favorable
