Arbitration 
This Agreement contains a predispute arbitration clause. By signing an arbitration 
agreement the parties agree as follows: 
• 
All parties to this Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, 
including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration 
forum in which a claim is filed. 
• 
Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court 
reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited. 
• 
The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other 
discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings. 
• 
The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award, unless, in an 
eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all 
parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date. 
• 
The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are 
affiliated with the securities industry. 
• 
The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in 
arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in 
court. 
• 
The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments to 
them, shall be incorporated into this Agreement. 
By opening an account at UBS, and by UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services 
Incorporated of Puerto Rico by accepting your application and carrying your account, you, 
UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS Financial Service Incorporated of Puerto Rico agree as 
follows: 
• 
To resolve any controversy, claim or issue in any controversy that may arise between 
you and UBS Financial Services or UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico 
by arbitration, whether it happen before or after, or at the time this Agreement was 
executed, including but not limited to controversies, claims or issues in any 
controversy concerning any account, transaction, dispute or the construction, 
performance or breach of this Agreement or any other agreement. 
• 
Any arbitration under this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act 
and shall be conducted before an arbitration panel convened by the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or any other national securities exchange's arbitration 
forum, upon which UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services Incorporated 
of Puerto Rico is legally required to arbitrate the controversy with you, including, 
where applicable, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. 
• 
Such arbitration shall be governed by the rules of the organization convening the 
panel. 
• 
The arbitrators shall resolve any controversy in accordance with applicable law. 
• 
The arbitrators will apply state and federal statutes of limitation the same as if the 
claim were brought as a civil action in court. 
• 
The award of the arbitration panel is not subject to appeal and judgment upon the 
award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
• 
No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration nor seek to 
enforce any pre-dispute arbitration Agreement against any person who has initiated 
in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not 
opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class 
action until: 
— 
the class certification is denied; or 
— 
the class is decertified; or 
— 
the customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to 
enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights 
under this agreement except to the extent stated herein. 
• 
You expressly agree that service of process in any action shall be sufficient if served 
by certified mail, return receipt requested, at your last address known to UBS. 
• 
You expressly waive any defense to service of process as set forth above. 
This Arbitration Agreement 
represents standard industry practice 
and binds you and UBS Financial 
Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services 
Incorporated of Puerto Rico to 
arbitrate any disagreements that may 
arise between the parties. 
'The parties', for purposes of this 
arbitration agreement are UBS 
Financial Services Inc. or UBS
