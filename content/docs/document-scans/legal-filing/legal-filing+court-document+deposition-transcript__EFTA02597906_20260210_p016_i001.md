determined by it not to be in proper form, or the acceptance of which or payment for which may, in the opinion of the 
Company=#39;s counsel, be unlawful. The Company also reserves the absolute right to waive any defect or irregularity 
in any tender of particular Shares, and the Company's interpretation of the terms of the Offer (including the instr=ctions

such tenders are irrevocable, exc=pt that they may be withdrawn after July 2, 1999 unless previously accepted fo= 
payment as provided in this Offer to Purchase. If the Company extends the period of time during which the Offer is 
open, is delayed in accepting for payment or paying for Shares or is unable to accept for payment or pay for Shares 
pursuant to the Offer for any reason, then, without prejudice to the Company's rights under the Offer, the Depositary 
may, on behalf of the Company, retain all Shares tendered, and such Shares may not be withdrawn except as otherwise 
provided in this Section 4, subject to Rule 13e-4(f)(5) under the Exchange Act, which provides that the issuer making the 
tender of=er shall either pay the consideration offered, or return the tendered securiti=s, promptly after the termination 
or withdrawal of the tender offer.

Depositary at one of its addresse= set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase and must

specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and 
the name of the registered holder of t=e Shares, if different from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If t=e 
Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered to the Depositary, a signed noti=e of withdrawal with signatures 
guaranteed by an Eligible Institution (except=in the case of Shares tendered by an Eligible Institution) must be submitted 
prior to the release of such Shares. In addition, such notice must specify,=in the case of Shares tendered by delivery of 
certificates, the name of the registered holder (if different from that of the tendering stockholder) and the serial 
numbers shown on the particular certificates evidencing the Shar=s to be withdrawn or, in the case of Shares tendered 
by book entry transfer, =he name and number of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the 
withdrawn Shares. Withdrawals may not be rescinded, and Shares withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not validly 
tendered for purpose= of the Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be retendered by again followin= one of the 
procedures described in Section 3 at any time prior to the Expiration Date. 
All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of an= notice of withdrawal will be determined by the 
Company, in its sole discretion, which determination shall be final and binding. None of the Company, the Dealer 
Managers, the Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any 
defect or irregularity in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure=to give any such notification.
