weeks, wh=n you delayed any detailed discussion of money wanting to give the i=sue a thoughtful response ( which I 
fully understand ) . you u=ilaterally changed changed our agreement. . 5m would be reserv=d for the future ? . and out 
of the remaining 15m ,? i would receiveronly a third. ( note : I'm confident that both the d=bt , and the artspace 
investment will also lead to = write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,yo= were surprised when I said that i 
require most people to pay =heir advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I will be prope=ly compensated for
