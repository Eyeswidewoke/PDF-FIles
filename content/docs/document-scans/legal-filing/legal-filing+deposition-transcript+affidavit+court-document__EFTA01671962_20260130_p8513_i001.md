Payments: Your payment must be sent to the payment address shown on your statement and must be received by 5 p.m. local time at that address 
to be credited as of the day it is received. Payments we receive after 5 p.m. will not be credited to your Account until the next day. Payments must 
also: (1) include the remittance coupon from your statement (2) be made with a single check drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a 
negotiable instrument payable in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system; and (3) Include your Account number. If your payment 
does not meet all of the above requirements, crediting may be delayed and you may incur late payment fees and additional interest charges. 
Electronic payments must be made through an electronic payment method payable in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. If 
we accept payment in a foreign currency, we will convert it into US dollars at a conversion rate that Is acceptable to us, unless a particular rate Is 
required by law. Please do not send post-dated checks as they will be deposited upon receipt. Any restrictive language on a payment we accept will 
have no effect on us without our express prior written approval. We will re-present to your financial institution any payment that is returned unpaid. 
Permission for Electronic Withdrawal: (1) When you send a check for payment, you give us permission to electronically withdraw your payment 
from your deposit or other asset account. We will process checks electronically by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number, account 
number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the check is not processable electronically or a less costly process is available. 
When we process your check electronically, your payment may be withdrawn from your deposit or other asset account as soon as the same day we 
receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your financial account statement. If we cannot collect the funds electronically 
we may issue a draft against your deposit or other asset account for the amount of the check. (2) By using Pay By Computer, Pay By Phone or any 
other electronic payment service of ours, you give us permission to electronically withdraw funds from the deposit or other asset account you specify 
in the amount you request. Payments using such services of ours received after &00 p.m. MST may not be credited until the next day. 
How We Calculate Your Balance: We use the Average Daily Balance (ADB) method (including new transactions) to calculate the balance on which 
we charge interest for Pay Over Time balances on your Account. Call the Customer Care number listed below for more information about this 
balance computation method and how resulting interest charges are determined. The method we use to figure the AD8 and interest results in daily 
compounding of interest. 
Paying Interest: If you have a Pay Over Time balance, your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. We will begin charging 
interest on transactions added to a Pay Over Time balance as of the date they are added. However, we will not charge interest on charges added to a 
Pay Over Time balance automatically (for example, Sign & Travel and Extended Payment Optionl if you pay the Account Total New Balance by the due 
date each month. 
Foreign Currency Charges: If you make a Charge in a foreign currency, we will convert it into US dollars on the date we or our agents process it. We 
will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date, unless a particular rate is required by law. The conversion rate we use is no more 
than the highest official rate published by a government agency or the highest interbank rate we identify from customary banking sources on the 
conversion date or the prior business day. This rate may differ from rates in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments 
will be billed at the rates such establishments use. 
Credit Balance: A credit balance (designated CR) shown on this statement represents money owed to you. If within the six-month period following 
the date of the first statement indicating the credit balance you do not request a refund or charge enough to use up the credit balance, we will send 
you a check for the credit balance within 30 days if the amount Is $1.00 or more. To request a refund, contact us at the address or phone number as 
noted below for Customer Care & Billing Inquiries. 
Credit Reporting: We may report information about your Account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your 
Account may be reflected in your credit report.
