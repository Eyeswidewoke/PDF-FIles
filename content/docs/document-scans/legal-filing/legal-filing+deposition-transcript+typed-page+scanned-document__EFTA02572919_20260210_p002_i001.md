Email helps out with other types of communication. It allows you to exchange a lot of information in advance of 
a meeting =and make the meeting far far more valuable... 
Email is not a good way to get mad at someone since you can't interact. You can send friendly messages very 
easily since those are harder to misinterpret. 
We began to E-mail each other three or four times a week. I would have a question about something and say to myself, 
"I'm going to E-mail Bill about that," and I'd write him a message and get a =one- or two-page message back within 
twenty-four hours, sometimes much =sooner. At the beginning of our electronic relationship, I would wake up in the 
middle of the night and lie in bed wondering if I had E-mail from Bill. Generally, he seemed to write messages at night, 
sleep (maybe), then send them the next morning. We were intimate in a curious =way, in the sense of being wired into 
each other's minds, but our contact was elaborately stylized, like ballroom dancing. 
In some ways, my E-mail relationship with Bill was like an ongoing, monthlong conversation, except that there was a 
pause =after each response to think; it was like football players huddling up =after each play. There was no beginning or 
end to Gates' messages--no time wasted on stuff like "Dear" and "Yours"--and I quickly corrected this etiquette breach in 
my own messages. Nor were there any fifth-grade-composition-book standards like "It may have come to your attention 
that" and "Looking forward to hearing from you." Social niceties are not what Bill Gates is about. Good spelling is not 
what Bill Gates is about, either. He never signed his messages to me, but sometimes he put an "&" at the end, which, I 
learned, means "Write =back" in E-mail language. After a while, he stopped putting the "&," but I wrote back anyway. He 
never addressed me by name. Instead of a letterhead, there was this:

For years after the telephone was invented, in 1876, people thought it was a device that would transmit news, 
drama, and music: the idea that the telephone was a way to talk to other people took about twenty years to sink in 
here, and about thirty years in Europe. Similarly, today one hears about shopping, banking, and renting =movies on the 
information highway. These are all possible ways of making money, of course, but the point of the information highway, 
it seems to me, is that it offers a new way of talking to other people. The trouble people have understanding this simple 
point is the same trouble people =in the nineteenth century had understanding the telephone. 
Bill Gates, aged thirty-eight, is one of the richest men in the country--the richest in 1992, and the second richest, after 
the investor Warren Buffett, in 1993, with a fortune of =six billion one hundred and sixty million dollars, according to 
Forbes. =Last March, when he announced his engagement to Melinda French, a twenty-nine-year-old manager at 
Microsoft, the news made the front page =of the Wall Street Journal. Gates controls the computer industry to an 
=extent matched by no other person in any other major industry. The Justice Department is currently trying to 
determine whether his control =constitutes a monopoly. 
Microsoft now supplies eighty per cent of all the personal-computer operating-system software in the world--that is, the 
=layer of software that translates your commands so that the computer can act on them--and fifty per cent of all the 
application software, which =is the tools, like Microsoft Word (writing) and Excel (accounting), that run on top of the 
operating system. Microsoft uses its leverage in the =operating-system market as a competitive advantage in the 
applications =market--a practice that is not nice but is not necessarily illegal. "You could say, as I have said to Bill, that 
having achieved this much power you should turn your attention to being magnanimous," a rival software =executive 
told me. "But Bill believes that now is not the time for statesmanship. Now is the time to conquer new foes, plunder new 
lands. =He doesn't like being compared to John D. Rockefeller--he goes, 'Hey, I'm not a grasping monopolist, am l?'--but 
he doesn't know how to behave any other way. To hold war councils and to design strategies with the =explicit aim of
