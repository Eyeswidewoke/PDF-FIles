=dentify the discrepancies between baseline neural signals in healthy individuals and =hose produced by someone with 
a particular disease. The conventional approach =o recording neural signals is to use tiny probes with electrodes inside 
=ailed patch clamps. A prostate-cancer researcher, for example, could attach patch =lamps to a nerve linked to the 
prostate in a healthy mouse and record the activity. =he same thing would be done with a mouse whose prostate had 
been genetically engineered to produce malignant tumors. Comparing the output from both =ight allow the researcher 
to determine how the neural signals differ in =ancerous mice. From such data, a corrective signal could be programmed 
into a =ioelectronic device to treat the cancer. 
But there are =rawbacks to using patch clamps. They can sample only one cell's activity at a time, and therefore fail to 
gather enough data to see the =ig picture. As Adam E. Cohen, who teaches chemistry and physics at Harvard, puts it, =E2 
It's like trying to watch an opera through a straw." 
Cohen, an expert in an emerging field called optogenetics, thinks he can overcome the limitations of the patch clamps. 
His research is trying to =se

optogenetics =o decipher the neural language of disease. "Getting patch =lamps into a single [neuron] is extremely slow 
and laborious — about =n hour per cell," Cohen told me when I visited his lab recently. "The bigger =roblem is that 
[neural] activity comes not from the voices of individual neurons but from a =hole orchestra of them acting in relation to 
each other. Poking at one at a =ime doesn't give you the global view." 
Optogenetics =rose out of a series of developments in the 1990s. Scientists knew that proteins, called opsins, in bacteria 
and algae generated =lectricity when exposed to light. Optogenetics exploits this mechanism. Opsin genes are =nserted 
into the DNA of a harmless virus, which is then injected into the brain =r a peripheral nerve of a test subject. By choosing 
a virus that prefers =ome cell types over others, or by altering the virus's genetic sequence, =esearchers can target 
specific neurons — cold- or pain-sensing, for example — =r regions of the brain known to be responsible for certain 
actions or behaviors. Next, an =ptical fiber — a spaghetti-thin glass cable that transmits light from its tip — =s inserted 
through the skin or skull to the site of the virus. The fiber's light =ctivates the opsin, which in turn conducts an electrical 
charge that forces the neuron to fire. =esearchers have already controlled mouse behavior with optogenetics — 
=nducing sleep and aggression on command. 
Before opsins =an be used to activate neurons involved in specific ailments, however, scientists must determine not only 
which neurons are =esponsible for a particular disease but also how that disease communicates with the =ervous 
system. Like computers, neurons speak a binary language, with a =ocabulary based on whether their signal is on or off. 
The specific sequence, =nterval and intensity of these on-off shifts determine how information is conveyed. =ut if each 
disease can be thought of as speaking its own language, then a =ranslator is needed. What Cohen and others recognized 
was that optogenetics can do =hat job. So Cohen reverse-engineered the process: Instead of using light to =ctivate 
neurons, he used light to record their activity.
