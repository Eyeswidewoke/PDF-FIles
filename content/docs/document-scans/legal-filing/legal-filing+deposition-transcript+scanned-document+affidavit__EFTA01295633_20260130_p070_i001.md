785 F.3d 895, "; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
clear that this hypothesized general rule cannot apply here, see J.A. 1519 ('The best 
sentiment I can muster in favor of the [Nucor] selection procedure is that it is consistent in 
its inconsistency."). See also, e.g., Tabor v. Hilti, Inc., 703 F.3d 1206, 1229 (10th Cir. 
2013) (affirming denial of class certification where "Plaintiffs challenge[d] a highly [**129] 
discretionary policy for granting promotions"). 
The majority also notes that the general manager formally approved promotions in the 
plant. Maj. op. at 50. Without saying so explicitly, the majority seems to propose that the 
general manager provided some common, plant-wide direction that drove common, plant-
wide disparities. Yet even the Brown I majority recognized that the general manager 
played no genuine role in the promotions decisionmaking process. 576 F.3d at 152 
("Although, by policy, the plant's general manager approves all promotions and handles 
discrimination and harassment investigations, the record suggests that each department 
manager has unbridled discretion to make promotions within his department utilizing 
whatever objective or subjective factors he wishes."). The evidence confirms that 
proposition. Promotions, the general manager explained, were "not [his] area of 
responsibility," as he had "department managers that ma[d]e those decisions." J.A. 8163. 
Nucor instead trained its department managers to make promotions decisions and 
implement the anti-discrimination policy. 
The majority nevertheless says the general manager engaged in "inaction." Maj. op. at 48, 
50. The majority's theory -- ["*130] premised on an assumed culture of "odious racism" 
and passive enabling -- resembles a theory that Wal-Mart out-and-out rejected. See 131 S. 
Ct. at 2553-54 (refusing to credit evidence asserting that a "strong corporate culture," 
enabled by policies of discretion, permitted bias in pay decisions); accord Davis v. Cintas 
Corp., 717 F.3d 476, 489 (6th Cir. 2013). 
Even if one assumes that such a theory were viable and relevant here, it would not prove 
commonality. "Inaction" -- letting supervisors do as they wish -- is just discretion by another 
name. "[I]t is a policy against having uniform employment practices." Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. 
at 2554. "Wal-Mart tells us that local discretion cannot support a company-wide class no 
matter how cleverly lawyers" (or judges) "may try to repackage local variability as 
uniformity." Bolden, 688 F.3d at 898; accord In re Navy Chaplaincy, No. 1:07--mc--269 
(GK), 306 F.R.D. 33, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122936, 2014 WL 4378781, at *15 (D.D.C. 
Sept. 4, 2014). Were it otherwise, one could find a common [147] policy in most every 
case, as most every company has a management head at the top that could be accused of 
not doing enough. Beyond that, Plaintiffs' experts never traced their identified disparities to 
the general manager, and their reports never even mention him. For good reason. 
Individual acts of discretion, not the general managers purported acquiescence, would 
have caused any disparities ["131] and the injuries that they reflect. Thus, the not-very-
common common policy does not present a common injury. 
Nucor also used a plant-wide "dual-approval" scheme, under which promotions required 
approval from both "originating" and "destination" department heads. The majority sees 
this as a case of potential "cat's paw" liability, wherein a non-decisionmaker influences the 
ultimate decisionmaker's choice in a discriminatory way. Maj. op. at 36-37 (citing Smith v. 
Bray, 681 F.3d 888, 897 & n.3 (7th Cir. 2012)). But nothing other than speculation 
indicates that dual approval was used to effect discrimination in any common way, and any
