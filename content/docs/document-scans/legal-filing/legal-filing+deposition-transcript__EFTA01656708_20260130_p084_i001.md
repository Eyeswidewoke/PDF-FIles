a Noose Recovered from Epstein's Cell 
After His Death."

New York 
The photographs of Epstein's cell on August 10, 2019, 
show an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing. 
Some of the linens had been ripped into thin strips, 
which were tied to the desk and bunkbed inside the 
cell. Some of the strips were tied like a noose. When 
shown a picture of Epstein's cell, Noel verified that it 
contained a lot of linen and extra clothing. Noel said 
the mattress on the floor was Epstein's, as he always 
slept on the mattress on the floor. As detailed in the 
BOP policies section of Chapter 2, MCC New York 
SHU Post Orders required that COs assigned to the 
SHU during the daytime tours of duty conduct at 
least five cell searches each day, and that the entire 
SHU, including all common areas and cells, be 
searched every week. The OIG investigation 
revealed, however, that on August 9, 2019, the SHU 
staff logged only one cell search in TRUSCOPE, and 
the search was not of Epstein's cell." BOP records 
did not indicate when Epstein's cell was last searched. 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that 
at least five cell searches should be conducted on the 
day and night watch shifts within the SHU, and that 
cell searches are conducted in cells every time the 
inmate departs the cell. He said the SHU Officer in Charge was responsible for making sure the searches 
were conducted and logged into the BOP TRUSCOPE database. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said 
that only one cell search was entered into TRUSCOPE on August 9, 2019, because cell searches were tedious 
to enter, and he was busy. He did not believe that it was a problem that only one cell search was logged on 
August 9 because he said the SHU staff would have gone into every cell when the inmates took their 
showers. He said that during the period of Epstein's custody, SHU inmates showered on Mondays, 
Wednesdays, and Fridays. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that during showers, SHU staff 
searched every cell. He explained that all of the SHU cells should have been searched on Friday, August 9 
because it was a shower day. He said SHU staff should also conduct cell searches when inmates go to the 
recreation area or for attorney visits. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, Epstein's cell 
should have been searched because both Epstein and Inmate 3 left the cell on the morning of August 9. He 
further stated that he believed that the majority of cells in the SHU were searched although, as noted above, 
the SHU staff logged only one cell search in TRUSCOPE on August 9 and the search was not of Epstein's cell. 
41 As noted previously, Epstein's cell contained an excessive amount of linens, some of which had been ripped into thin 
strips and tied like a noose. Figure 6.5 depicts one such noose, which is illustrative of the types of linens found in 
Epstein's cell; the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself. 
" TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related 
information and provides unit officers an electronic event log.
