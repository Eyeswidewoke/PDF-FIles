• the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the Non-U.S. holder within the 
United States (and, under certain income tax treaties, is attributable to a United States permanent 
establishment or fixed base maintained by the Non-U.S. holder); or 
• we are or have been a "U.S. real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any 
time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of disposition or the period that the Non-
U.S. holder held our common stock, and, in the case where shares of our common stock arc regularly 
traded on an established securities market, the Non-U.S. holder has owned, directly or constructively, more 
than 5% of our common stock at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the 
disposition or such Non-U.S. holder's holding period for the shares of our common stock. There can be no 
assurance that our common stock will be treated as regularly traded on an established securities market for 
this purpose. 
Unless an applicable treaty provides othenvise, gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to 
tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates as if the Non-U.S. holder were a U.S. resident. Any gains 
described in the first bullet point above of a Non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to 
an additional "branch profits tax" at a 30% rate (or lower treaty rate). 
If the second bullet point above applies to a Non-U.S. holder, gain recognized by such holder on the sale. 
exchange or other disposition of our common stock or warrants will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. 
federal income tax rates. In addition, a buyer of our common stock or warrants from such holder may be required 
to withhold U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 10% of the amount realized upon such disposition. We cannot 
determine whether we will be a U.S. real property holding corporation in the future until we complete an initial 
business combination. We will be classified as a U.S. real property holding corporation if the fair market value of 
our "U.S. real property interests" equals or exert' s 50 percent of the sum of the fair market value of our 
worldwide real property interests plus our other assets used or held for use in a trade or business, as determined 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
Redemption of Common Stock. The characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the redemption 
of a Non-U.S. holder's common stock pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under 
"Description of Securities—Common Stock" generally will coinapond to the U.S. federal income tax 
characterization of such a redemption of a U.S. holder's common stock, as described under "U.S. holders—
Redemption of Common Stock" above, and the consequences of the redemption to the Non-U.S. holder will be as 
described above under "Non-U.S. holders—Taxation of INstributions" and "Non-U.S. holders—Gain on Sale, 
Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Stock and Warrants," as applicable. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection 
with payments of dividends and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our units, shares of common stock 
and warrants. A Non-U.S. holder may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that it is not a 
United States person in order to avoid information reporting and backup withholding requirements. The 
certification procedures required to claim a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty will satisfy the certification 
requirements necessary to avoid the backup withholding as well. The amount of any backup withholding from a 
payment to a Non-U.S. holder will be allowed as a credit against such holder's U.S. federal income tax liability 
and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the Internal 
Revenue Service.

FATCA Withholding Taxes. Provisions commonly referred to as "FATCA" impose withholding of 30% on 
payments of dividends (including constructive dividends) on our common stock or warrants, and, beginning in 
2017. sales or other disposition proceeds from our units, shares of common stock and warrants to "foreign 
financial institutions" (which is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes investment vehicles) and 
certain other Non-U.S. entities unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements 
(generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities) have been 
satisfied, or an exemption applies (typically certified as to by the delivery of a properly completed IRS Form W-
8BEN-E). If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution 
generally will be entitled to a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which 
may entail significant administrative burden). Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an 
intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. 
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the effects of FATCA on their investment in our 
securities.
