FINDING FAKE NEWS New American, The May 8, 2017 Monday 
Long before Donald Trump made the "Fake News" meme synonymous with the 
"progressive" establishment media, multiple surveys had already shown that Americans 
had lost virtually all respect for, and trust in, the media. Gallup, Pew, and other pollsters 
have found that almost 70 percent of Americans distrust the "mainstream media" (MSM). 
Not surprisingly, more and more Americans have turned to social media and the multitude 
of newer, alternative news sources on the Internet. Examples of fake news - which 
encompass outright fabrications as well as gross distortions and censorship of real news -
have become so egregious and commonplace that it is impossible to list them all. Below is 
but a fraction of the fake news proliferation. 
*"Hands up, don't shoot": In appearances on Fox News programs on December 8,2016, 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sheriff David Clarke charged that 'fake news" was "born" with the 
widespread media propagation of the "hands up, don't shoot!" lie, that claimed Michael 
Brown, a young black man, was shot dead in cold blood by white police officer Darren 
Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. This lie greatly fueled the deadly riots that followed 
throughout the country. "The 'hands up, don't shoot' lie was propagated by every 
mainstream liberal media across this country," Clarke said. "The New York Times, the 
Washington Post, the LA Times, the Chicago Tribune, CNN, MSNBC, all propagated that 
'hands up, don't shoot' lie. It was from that time forward that this concept of fake news was 
talked about." 
Very few members of the MSM have fessed up to their part in this horrendous lie. One who 
has is Jonathan Capehart, who wrote a mea culpa column in the Washington Post on 
March 16, 2015 entitled "'Hands up, don't shoot' was built on a lie." Like Clarke, Capehart 
is a black man, but similarities seem to end there; Capehart is a liberalleft Democrat, 
commentator for MSNBC, columnist for the Post, and a homosexual activist "married" to 
Obama State Department official Nick Schmit. Nevertheless, after Capehart had read the 
official reports on the shooting, he confessed they had "forced me to deal with two 
uncomfortable truths: Brown never surrendered with his hands up, and Wilson was justified 
in shooting Brown." 
* Hate-crime hoax epidemic: Vilifying conservatives with various "hate" labels - racist, anti-
semite, misogynist, xenophobe, homophobe - has been the standard operating procedure 
of the MSM for decades. However, this practice intensified to an alarming degree during 
the recent election cycle - and after. Dozens of stories of alleged hate crimes by Trump 
supporters have been given huge media coverage, only to be later proven to be fabricated 
(often with the "victim" confessing and being prosecuted for making the false charges). 
Rarely, however, do the media publicize the subsequent facts that discredit the earlier 
false claims. 
* Global warming, hoax of the century - For more than 20 years, the MSM propagandists 
have been hyperventilating over the supposed dire danger of anthropogenic (man-made) 
global warming, or AGW, to justify vast new government programs that would cost trillions 
of dollars and exterminate freedom. Among the hundreds of AGW lies that have been 
perpetrated is the claim that 97-99 percent of scientists agree that AGW is an existential 
threat to all life on the planet.
