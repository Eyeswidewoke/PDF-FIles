785 F.3d 895, "; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, "*; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
The majority's analysis casts an inappropriate role for an appellate court. Now, ['.77] a 
court must review each decision that an appellant cites and independently consider 
whether any part of it might undermine the district court's judgment for some reason that 
the appellant never raised. That concept reconceives the appellate courts' role, as those 
"courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research." Nat'l Aeronautics & 
Space Admin. v. Nelson, 562 U.S. 134, 147 n.10, 131 S. Ct. 746, 178 L. Ed. 2d 667 
(2011); see also Walker v. Prince George's Cnty., Md., 575 F.3d 426, 429 n." (4th Cir. 
2009) ("Judges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in briefs."). In addition, using the 
[1'926] majority's new rule, appellants may now launch late-in-the-day challenges to any 
part of a district court's certification decision so long as they serendipitously cited a case 
canvassing Rule 23 in their opening brief. This "preservation-by-citation" approach renders 
the waiver rule a nullity. 
D. 
In the end, the majority declares itself unwilling to exercise its "discretion" to "discard years 
of litigation on appeal because of an inartful brief." Maj. op. at 58. That approach seems to 
give pro se litigant treatment to a brief crafted by experienced class counsel -- counsel that 
has appeared in our court before. Surely it does not expect too much from veteran counsel 
to ask them to make their arguments straight up and square. All the more ("78] so when 
these counsel have been specifically cautioned about waiver on previous occasions. See, 
e.g., Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., 516 F.3d 955, 972-73 (11th Cir. 2008) 
(holding that party represented by same counsel had "abandoned" claim by failing to raise 
it in his opening brief); see also Angles v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., 494 F. App'x 326, 330 
n.6 (4th Cir. 2012) (same); cf. Bennett, 656 F.3d at 821 (holding that party represented by 
same counsel had "essentially abandoned" argument by making only a "conclusory 
challenge"); Anderson v. Cagle's, Inc., 488 F.3d 945, 959 (11th Cir. 2007) (same). 
The "purpose" of the preservation rule is also not served by overlooking Plaintiffs' waiver. 
See maj. op. at 57-58. The rule "ensures that the opposing party has an opportunity to 
reflect upon and respond in writing to the arguments that his adversary is raising." 
Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., 680 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir. 2012); see also 
United States v. Leeson, 453 F.3d 631, 638 n.4 (4th Cir. 2006) (noting that late arguments 
are "unfair to the appellee"); Pignons S.A. de Mecanique v. Polaroid Corp., 701 F.2d 1, 3 
(1st Cir. 1983) ("In preparing briefs and arguments, an appellee is entitled to rely on the 
content of an appellant's brief for the scope of the issues appealed[.]"). Nucor never had a 
chance to address Plaintiffs' predominance arguments directly, as Plaintiffs waited until 
their reply brief to make them. Plaintiffs argued in their reply brief, for example, that no 
"heightened" predominance standard applies after Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. 
Ct. 2541, 2551, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011), and the majority agrees, see maj. op. at 62. 
There might very well be reason to believe ("79] otherwise, though Nucor has never had 
a chance to make that argument. See, e.g., Andrey Spektor, The Death Knell of Issue 
Certification and Why That Matters After Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 26 St. Thomas L. Rev. 165, 
172 (2014) (suggesting that Wal-Mart rendered it harder for issues to predominate). It must 
be cold comfort to Nucor, then, to hear that it was not "prejudice[d]" by these and other 
unanswerable arguments. Maj. op. at 58.
