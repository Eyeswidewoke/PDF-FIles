HY Multi Sector.Media, Cable & Satellite 
and framing (including roofing costs) were the top two cost line-items at about 
22% and 15%, respectively, of the overall cost of an average single-family 
house. Land prices continue to increase given they are a residual of housing 
price movements. Some commentary was made surrounding this issue by 
homebuilders participating at our 2017 Building Conference (link to our equity 
teams notes here: DB's 2017 Building Conference: Notes and Conclusions). 
As an example, Toll Brothers commented that CA-based land sellers saw 
homebuilders' margins expanding and have re-rated their land prices higher. 
As shown in Figure 17, the Random Lengths Lumber Composite is also 
accelerating with recent readings in the index at S458/bdft, an increase of 
27.6% y/y. 
Homebuilders continue to be able to pass along inflationary 
pressures to consumers but it is a dynamic worth monitoring given the steady 
and wide-spread material/labor inflation likely to be seen in 2018, and already 
growing pressure on affordability.

Infrastructure: Getting Back On Track in 2018 
2017 Disappointing Year, 2018 Looks More Promising 
The infrastructure market - 
specifically highways, bridges, roads and 
transportation - had a disappointing year in 2017. 
Coming into 2017, 
expectations were running high that the newly-elected President Trump could 
drive through an infrastructure stimulus, but this was not the case. According 
to the construction-put-in-place series, YTD infrastructure spending was 
$110bn, a decline of about 3% versus the same period in 2016. However, the 
outlook for spending remains positive with 2018 likely to show growth closer 
to its longer-term trend line of -3%. During DB's 2017 Building Conference, 
there were some interesting anecdotes from the management team of Martin 
Marietta - producers of aggregates and heavy building materials - whom 
commented that the industry's underperformance was not only due to the 
impact of weather (i.e. storms, rainfall) but also bottlenecks at state-level DOTs. 
Due to years of budgetary constraints, staffing is short and unable to deal with 
the planning and approval process to vet and execute projects. Management 
for Martin also noted that DOTs have also begun to hire third-party engineering 
firms to alleviate some of these issues and accelerate approvals. The funding 
levels remain stable and favorable with the Fixing America's Surface 
Transportation (FAST) Act signed into law on 12/4/15, the first long-term 
federal funding bill in over a decade. While the absolute amount of spending 
did not increase substantially, the bill provides for $305bn to be spent across 5 
years (2016 - 2020) on a number of infrastructure initiatives (annual CAGR of 
2.5% until 2020). Depending on the ability of Trump and Congress to pass tax 
reform, there is also some decent optionality that an infrastructure stimulus 
can be passed in 2018.
