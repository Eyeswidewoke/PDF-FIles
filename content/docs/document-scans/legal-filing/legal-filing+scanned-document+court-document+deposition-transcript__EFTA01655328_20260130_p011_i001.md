General Events 
• 14th annual Municipal Finance Conference — Tuesday, July 22, 2025. Location: Online event, 8:45 AM. The 
annual Municipal Finance Conference brings together academics, practitioners, issuers, and regulators to 
discuss recent research on municipal capital markets and state and local fiscal issues. The conference is a 
joint venture of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, the 
Rosenberg Institute of Global Finance at Brandeis International Business School, the Mitch Daniels School of 
Business at Purdue University, the Harris School of Public Policy at University of Chicago, and the MI School 
of Public Affairs at University of Texas at Austin. The 2025 conference will primarily be held in person, with 
livestream options for remote viewers, on July 22 and 23 at 1777 F St. NW. 
• The Heritage Foundation: The 2025 B.C. Lee Lecture featuring Congressman John Moolenaar — Tuesday, July 
22, 2025. Location: Online event, 10:30 AM. Decades of U.S. engagement with China, fueled by trade and 
manufacturing policies that empowered the Chinese Communist Party, have left the U.S. dependent on 
China. Critical supply chains, from vital rare-earth elements to key pharmaceutical products, remain largely 
or wholly dependent on the Chinese Communist Party. 
• American Progress: An Urgent Warning from Texas: A Conversation on Defending Democracy and Fighting 
Authoritarianism in the States — Tuesday, July 22, 2025. Location: Online event, 1:30 PM. In states across the 
country, American democracy is being hollowed out from within. Elected leaders are using democratic tools 
to antidemocratic ends, systematically eroding our institutions not through violence but through law. Texas' 
legislature will soon consider taking the extraordinary step of redistricting in the middle of a decade, 
potentially diluting the votes of millions of Texans and swaying the balance of power in Congress. Former 
U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) has spent years fighting voter suppression while organizing people in every 
part of Texas, and he is a leader in the fight against emerging authoritarianism at the state level. Norm Eisen 
is litigating numerous cases around the nation as part of his ongoing efforts to fight for a stronger 
democracy. 
• AEI: Meet the Stars: Screening the FREE Initiative's Mini-Documentary Films — Tuesday, July 22, 2025. 
Location: AEI Auditorium, 5:30 PM. How do you inspire a sense of agency in young people? According to 
AEI's Ian Rowe, family, religion, education, and entrepreneurship are the foundational building blocks of 
agency.
