We then project our model to assess the prospects for wage acceleration in 
the near future. If the unemployment rate remains stagnant at its present level, 
5.5%, the NAIRU will not get breached and our model implies that wage 
inflation will not increase. By contrast, suppose that the unemployment rate 
continues its rapid decline. In particular, we consider the case in which payrolls 
grow at a steady pace of 225k per month through the end of 01 2016, and 
simulate the path of the unemployment rate using the Atlanta Fed's "Jobs 
Calculator", under the assumption of an unchanged labor force participation 
rate.1 Then our model suggests that wage inflation will pick up because the 
NAIRU will be breached. The timing of this event, however, depends crucially 
on the estimate of the NAIRU. In our projection, the unemployment rate will 
fall below the CBO's estimate of the NAIRU, which is slightly below 5.4%, in 
Q2 2015. But it will only fall below the FOMC's most recent estimate, 5.0%-
5.2%, in 03 or Q4 2015.2 
This highlights the importance of the FOMC's reduction of its NAIRU estimate 
at the March meeting from a range that was consistent with the CBO's 
estimate to the above-discussed range. All else being equal, the lower NAIRU 
estimate implies that the FOMC expects wage acceleration to be delayed by 
three-to-six months. The likely corollary is that the committee now expects to 
raise rates a quarter or two later.

Japanese Potential Buyers> 
Treasury demand ebbs and flows between different investor classes. In 2014h2 
foreign FX reserves managers became important but as much as a 
diversification trade away from Euros. Given the decision by the GPIF to 
increase their allocation to overseas bonds and equities, there is naturally a lot 
of interest in the potential for Japanese buying of Treasuries going forward. 
Here we try and quantify the potential in terms of three specific sectors: 
pensions; insurance and deposit taking institutions including the banks and 
post office. Note that we only have data for outward investment so this is not 
exclusively Treasuries but we can presume that the bulk of any outward 
investment adjustments will be made via Treasuries, given low Euro yields. 
We also assume that the average moat* population growth rate and the average monthly CES/CPS 
acitMOyMent ratio remain at their current levels. 
' For illustrative purposes. the chart uses the lower bound c4 the FOMC's estimate. 5 0%. which gets 
breached in O4 2015 in our projection.
