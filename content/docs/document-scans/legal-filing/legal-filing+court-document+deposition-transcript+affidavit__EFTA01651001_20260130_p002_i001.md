Re: United States v. Defendant(s) Ghislaine Maxwell 
Case Number 2020R00719 and Court Docket Number 20-CR-00330 
Dear 
The enclosed information is provided by the United States Department of Justice Victim Notification 
System (VNS). As a victim witness professional, my role is to assist you with information and services 
during the prosecution of this case. I am contacting you because you were identified by law 
enforcement as a victim or potential victim during the investigation of the above criminal case. 
Charges have been filed against defendant(s) Ghislaine Maxwell. The lead prosecutor for this case is 
ALEXANDER ROSSMILLER. The main charge is categorized as Project Safe Childhood. 
Assistant United States Maurene Comey and Assistant United States Attorney Alison Moe 
Victims of all crimes under federal investigation are entitled to services under the Victims' Rights and 
Restitution Act (VRRA), including notification of court events. For further details, please refer to Title 34 
United States Code section 20141 or the VRRA link posted at https://www.notify.usdoj.gov. 
Now that charges have been filed in federal court, victims of the charges filed are, in addition, entitled 
to the following rights, according to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, Title 18 United States Code section 
3771: (1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused; (2) The right to reasonable, accurate, 
and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of 
any release or escape of the accused; (3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court 
proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony 
by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding; (4) The 
right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, 
sentencing, or any parole proceeding; (5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government in the case; (6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law; (7) The right to 
proceedings free from unreasonable delay; (8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect 
for the victim's dignity and privacy; (9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain 
or deferred prosecution agreement; and (10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section 
and the services described in section 503(c) of the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (34 
U.S.C. 20141(c)) and provided contact information for the Office of the Victims' Rights Ombudsman of 
the Department of Justice. 
Please understand that these rights apply only to victims of the counts charged in federal court, and 
thus you may not be able to exercise all of these rights if the crime of which you are a victim was not 
charged. In any event, we will continue to provide you with notifications and services unless you tell us 
not to. We will make our best efforts to ensure you are provided the rights and services to which you 
are entitled. You may contact the Victim/Witness Coordinator at the office listed above if you have 
questions about the progress of your case, your rights or the services to which you are entitled, or how
