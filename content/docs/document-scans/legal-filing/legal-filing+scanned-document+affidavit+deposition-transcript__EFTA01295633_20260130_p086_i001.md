2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82496, * 
charges will be applied to [his] account, plus interest" and that Defendants "charged his 
account the prior month for the five months of insurance premiums" they claimed he owed 
since the lapse of his previous policy. (Compl. ¶ 33) See also id. ¶¶ 81 and 85, describing 
the application of the charge to Plaintiffs loan balance and against his escrow account. 
Plaintiff does not clearly assert what portion (any or all) of these charges he actually paid. 
A charged fee, though unpaid, can constitute injury. See Barrows v. Chase Manhattan 
Mortgage Corp., 465 F. Supp. 2d 347, 366 (D.N.J. 2006)(finding that plaintiff had standing 
to claim a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, because "Plaintiffs 
contention that Defendants had a duty to insure the propriety of any attempt to collect [the 
fees charged] negates Defendants' argument that Plaintiff needed to have actually paid 
such fees.")(emphasis added). ['13] Moreover, the application of allegedly unlawful 
charges to Plaintiff's loan balance (Id. ¶ 81) necessarily increased his balance, and this 
accumulation of debts may reduce equity, affect credit ratings, limit borrowing capacity, or 
otherwise cause a concrete injury to a plaintiff, even if he never actually pays the debt 
accumulated, perhaps due to foreclosure or bankruptcy. 
Beyond Article III standing. this Court has statutory jurisdiction over "any civil action in 
which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000, exclusive of 
interest and costs" and where "any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State 
different from any defendant." 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2). Plaintiff here, a citizen of New 
Jersey, alleges against Defendants, citizens of Ohio or Colorado, an amount in 
controversy exceeding $5 million. (Compl. ¶¶ 20-23) 
Having confirmed jurisdiction, the Court now turns to the merits of Statebridge's motion to 
dismiss. 
Ill. Legal Standard 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides that a court may dismiss a complaint "for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." In order to survive a motion to 
dismiss, a complaint must allege facts that raise a right to relief above the speculative 
level. [94] Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 
2d 929 (2007); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). 
When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the reviewing court must accept as true all 
allegations in the complaint and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. 
Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 231 (3d Cir. 2008). In reviewing the 
allegations, a court is not required to accept sweeping legal conclusions cast in the form of 
factual allegations, unwarranted inferences, or unsupported conclusions. Morse v. Lower 
Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997). Instead, the complaint must state 
sufficient facts to show that the legal allegations are not simply possible, but plausible. 
Phillips, 515 F.3d at 234. "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual 
content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable 
for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. lqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. 
Ed. 2d 868 (2009). 
Finally, the Court considers "only the allegations in the complaint, exhibits attached to the 
complaint, matters of public record, and documents that form the basis of a claim." Lum v.
