o%20POTUS%20rene=ed%20nuclear%20diplomacy%20issues.pdf> still tighter sanctions—the one factor Washington 
experts seem to agree =as prompted Tehran's conciliatory turn—it is unclear how the US negoti=tors can elicit from Mr. 
Zarif and his masters a sufficient Iranian compro=ise that will not look to all the world like a capitulation. And if the US 
side cannot bring to the table assuranc=s of sanctions relief sufficient to seal an acceptable deal, its predicame=t may 
induce paralyzing caution on other policy fronts deemed important to=Tehran, lest the collaborative spirit at the nuclear 
talks be spoiled. 
All three negotiati=ns underway, regarding Israel-Palestine, Syria, and Iran's nuclear progr=m, are inescapably attached 
to larger region-wide dynamics that will frust=ate American objectives if not addressed by US foreign policy. President 
Obama needs a strategy. 
American Interests,=American Principles, American Influence—an American Strategy 
Policy veterans in =ashington cannot point to any prior case where economic sanctions have "=icked in" strongly enough 
to produce the desired result—until now. San=tions against the regimes led by Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein and 
Bashar al-Assad produced scarcity and hardsh=p for the poorest of their citizens but enriched the leadership circle, wh= 
exacted higher rents on the basic commodities they alone could smuggle in= 
Kudos to the US Tre=sury Department for locating and constricting the key transactional nodes =hrough which Iran's 
economy connects to the world. Yet the tool of econo=ic sanctions against Iran, while more potent than any previous 
instance, should be troubling to US policymakers.=With the exception of the clerical regime, Iran's 79 million people 
ough= to be the target of American goodwill, not collective punishment for the =cts of their dictators. Sustaining the US 
economy as the world's strongest depends on free trade; a latter-=ay 'blockade' of any country by the United States 
should be a rare exc=ption, for policy and moral reasons. 
One consequence of =he Iran sanctions that mirrors past cases, <http://article=.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-
2S/opinions/42392666_1_nuclear-issue-revolutio=ary-guard-corps-iranophobia> as Fareed Zakaria has pointed 
out=/span> <http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-25/opinion=/42392666_1_nuclear-issue-revolutionary-guard-
corps-iranophobia> , is that Iran's Revolutionary Guards "profit from the sanctions because=their businesses have 
become the only path for trade and smuggling." 
For these reasons, =resident Obama should strengthen his negotiating hand with Iran by collaborating with Congress to 
make clear, not just what further economic pain and=isolation will result from Tehran's refusal to accept a verifiable end 
to its nuclear weapons program, but the=relief and rewards that a comprehensive nuclear concession by Iran's lea=ers 
will produce. Every citizen of Iran should become aware that the US is=offering an end to those sanctions that were 
created for the purpose of pressuring Iran on the nuclear issue=97whether via executive order or legislation. The 
Congress could also indi=ate its readiness in principle to support the lifting of UN Security Counc=l sanctions relating to 
the nuclear issue. 
This step would pla=e the onus for compromise back on the Iranian side of the negotiating tabl=, forcing the regime to 
explain to its people why it would not accept a de=I codifying what it has already said is its policy, namely that it does 
not seek to build nuclear weapons that =t wants sanctions relief in order to secure an immediate upsurge in the en=ire 
country's standard of living. Assuming Iran can say yes to comprehen=ive nuclear restraints for comprehensive sanctions 
relief, the Revolutionary Guards' lucrative smuggling business=would be over. More importantly, the terrible choice 
between war with Iran=or a regional nuclear arms race would be averted. 
Reciprocating Presi=ent Rouhani's expressed desire for improved relations, the Congress and =dministration should even 
consider fattening Iran's 'prize' for an a=ceptable nuclear deal with a package of increased student visas, cultural and
