After months of repression, peaceful demonstrations gave way to armed oppos=tion. But it has failed to mount effective 
defenses of rebel neighborhoods=or inflict casualties on the army and security forces. In recent months re=ression has 
become increasingly murderous, with artillery raining down on cities and militias slaughtering=villagers. 
Options 
Intransigent regimes historically have caused despair, withdrawal from poli=ics, retreat into private life, and emigration. 
This would of course be we=come by the old regimes today, taking away a good deal of the pressure to =eform. The 
lower turnout in successive Egyptian elections may be encouraging to rulers. 
These options are unlikely today as Arab youth has insufficient opportunity=to work and have families. Emigration will 
seem attractive to many, especi=lly to Europe and the US. However, those countries are not as open as they=once were 
to immigrants, and young men from the Middle East may be among the least welcome. 
The activists in the Arab world today have thus far exhibited remarkable te=acity in the face of oppression and 
intransigence from rulers. There is st=ll the conviction that their moment is at hand and failure will bring on d=cades of 
continued misrule. Unlike many rulers of the past, those in power today have the capacity to come do=n on activists and 
their families both cruelly and relentlessly. 
A change in tactics will come and in places take the form of using violence=and terrorism, initially sporadic and 
unorganized but with potential for b=coming well organized, whether from new organizations or grafting on to ex=sting 
ones. They will target personnel in the security forces, military, and state. Student groups and activist n=tworks that 
coalesced early last year may turn their organizational skills=to these acts, just as some in the US antiwar movement 
formed the Weather =nderground after the 1968 police crackdown in Chicago, and launched a bombing campaign. 
A more historically significant parallel is the People's Will, a Russ=an group that emerged following the failure of 
populism and which assassin=ted Tsar Alexander III in 1894. It set the groundwork for later secret pol=tical movements 
that were dedicated to overthrowing the Romanov dynasty and directed by fearsome, single-minded f=gures. 
Existing structures may serve the same purpose. The Muslim Brotherhood or s=linter groups of it, in both Egypt and 
Syria, have been known to use viole=ce. In Egypt, a splinter group assassinated president Anwar Sadat in 1981.=ln Syria, 
the Muslim Brotherhood began a wave of bombings that led to the regime's ruthless attack on=the city of Hama in 1982. 
Salafist networks have long inculcated not only an austere form of Islam bu= also militancy and a zeal to transform the 
world and establish a just (Is=amist) state. Salafis have an at least semi-secret organization with unsee= but munificent 
benefactors, probably in Saudi Arabia. They have long acted as recruitment networks for causes i= Bosnia, Chechnya, 
and Afghanistan during the Soviet war (1979-89). Today =hey have ties to the Sunni insurgents in Iraq, who in turn have 
ties to Ir=qi refugees in Syria. 
Salafi networks, however, are thought to be tied to Wahhabi clerics and Sau=i intelligence, both of which recoil from 
democracy and support the cause =f autocracy in the region. Salafism enjoys an intermediary position betwee= the 
conservative House of Saud and the revolutionary al•Qaeda movement. 
Part of al-Qaeda's appeal over the years has been its argument that s=cular dictatorships are unreformable and can only 
be brought down through =rmed struggle, which in turn will bring social justice. The Arab Spring wa= thought to signal 
the end of al-Qaeda's appeal by showing that secular dictatorships could indeed be brought down =ithout the 
cataclysms Osama bin Laden and the like called for. 
The persistence of secular dictatorships will bring new appreciation of al-=aeda as intransigent regimes are ratifying a 
central part of its thought. =gents of al-Qaeda are doubtless making this point in the region and only a=few thousand 
converts could be problematic if not disastrous. Western powers supportive of democracy and =ulf powers supportive of 
autocracy might well bear this in mind, though of=course the old regimes will not.
