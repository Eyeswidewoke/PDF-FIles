GEM Equity Strategy Outlook 2014 
future prospects for the economy and drive further outflows. Against this 
backdrop the Chinese authorities will do everything they can to maintain 
confidence in the value of the Renminbi in order to attract further inflows 
despite the fact that the currency appears increasingly overvalued from a 
corporate perspective. The necessity to attract large flows of foreign capital 
into China on an ongoing basis also implies that China is not such a safe haven 
if foreign inflows into emerging markets begin to dry up in 2014, despite the 
very comfortable current account and official fiscal ratios. 
What should investors do in the face of such uncertainty? We would 
completely disregard the apparent cheapness of the market and would advise 
GEM investors to take a big underweight position, and non-dedicated investors 
to avoid Chinese equities entirely wherever possible. We do acknowledge 
though that this very negative stance will be considered far too extreme by 
most benchmarked investors in which case we would adopt a dual strategy. 
First, we do not see a strong case for taking big sector bets within a China 
portfolio, since post-Plenum, the valuation discrepancy between perceived 
winners and losers from anticipated shifts in the economy has become 
increasingly extreme. If our bearish medium term view on the economy plays 
out, then consumption will suffer along with investment, which will leave the 
very expensive Healthcare and Staples sectors very exposed. The banks are a 
black box, just as the developed market financials were going into the 2007-08 
crisis; current valuations are obviously discounting a fairly hefty level of 
impairment, but it is difficult to claim that a worst case scenario is priced in. 
Secondly, we would advise a contrarian strategy for those investors who are 
understandably unwilling to take a strong structural view on China. This has 
been the right strategy for the past four years as the lack of visibility 
concerning policy and the underlying state of the economy and financial 
condition of the corporate sector has driven wild swings in sentiment among 
investors. At present, both investor surveys and fund flows suggest that 
weightings have increased markedly along with confidence in economic policy, 
so now should not be a bad time to scale back exposure. 
Finally, there are many reasons why we might be too pessimistic about 
Chinese equities but there is one sign in particular which might cause us to 
concede that we are wrong. The increasingly obvious accretion of power and 
more assertive attitude by the Beijing based authorities has some negative 
connotations in terms of foreign and social policy, but could be very positive 
from an economic perspective if Beijing intends to impose market disciplines 
on local authorities. We believe that the new administration will back away 
from the consequences of imposing a hard budget constraint, but if this did 
start to happen evidenced by meaningful closures of industrial capacity and 
widespread curtailment of future investment plans, the long term implications 
would be very positive, although the economy and some key sector would take 
a short term hit. We will continue to monitor individual industries to try to 
identify any sectors where there is a clear prospect of individual winners 
emerging from a process of consolidation.
