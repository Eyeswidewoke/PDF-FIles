the 1940s, the United States has led the world on innovation and on developing new technologies, 
industries, and business models, securing its position as a global superpower. However, in the face of 
significant national security challenges and an intensifying global technology race, the U.S. position faces 
challenges. How can American companies keep pace with their international counterparts? What is the role 
of regulators in preserving competition, fueling critical national security inputs, and facilitating innovation, 
particularly in the Al and technology fields? And can the United States maintain its position ahead of its 
geopolitical rivals as the reigning economic and technological world power? Join Chair of the Federal Trade 
Commission Lina M. Khan and Rana Foroohar, associate editor at the Financial Times, for a conversation on 
these and other issues. 
• Atlantic Council: EnergySource Innovation Stream with Asoba: Enabling energy access in Africa — Wednesday, 
March 13, 2024. Location: Online Event, 10:00 AM. Please join the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center for 
the next episode of EnergySource Innovation Stream. This series highlights energy innovations with the 
potential to reshape the global energy system through discussions with the companies and individuals 
working diligently to enable these technologies. On Wednesday, March 13, from 10:00 a.m. — 10:30 a.m. ET, 
the Global Energy Center will host Shingai Samudzi, CEO and Founder of Asoba, to discuss the expansion of 
clean energy in Africa. William Tobin, Assistant Director at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center, will 
moderate the discussion. For African economies, energy access is essential to enabling economic and social 
development. Yet, almost 80 percent of African businesses lack access to stable and affordable energy 
sources. Africa represents an energy paradox, a continent rich in renewable energy resources but still 
struggling with high levels of energy poverty. Unreliable and aging energy infrastructure alongside limited 
financial investment have proved to be substantial roadblocks in expanding energy access across Africa. 
Asoba is working to change this. Asoba leverages grid technologies to manage onsite renewable energy 
assets through load forecasting, supply and demand management, and dispatch scheduling. Doing so creates 
opportunities for more efficient energy supply across the grid and maximizes long term revenue, placing 
Asoba at the center of a new era of electricity in Africa. 
• Atlantic Council: Baltic bulwark: Prime Minister Evika Silina on Latvia's transatlantic role — Wednesday, March 
13, 2024. Location: Atlantic Council, 3:00 PM. On March 13 at 3:00 p.m. ET/8:00 p.m. CET, the Atlantic 
Council is hosting an #ACFrontPage conversation with Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silica. The prime minister 
will explore Latvia's role in transatlantic affairs and its importance in the Baltic region as a bulwark against 
Russia. In the two years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, Latvia has reaffirmed its status as 
a steadfast NATO ally and a pivotal player in efforts to safeguard stability, promote collective defense, and 
support Kyiv. Additionally, Latvia has surpassed NATO's 2 percent of gross domestic product defense-
spending threshold and currently hosts a NATO forward presence battle group to bolster the Alliance's 
eastern flank. With several important milestones to come over the course of this year—including the 
twentieth anniversary of Latvia's accession to NATO and the Alliance's seventy-fifth anniversary—Silica joins 
the Atlantic Council to outline her government's priorities for the upcoming NATO Summit in Washington 
and to discuss how the United States and the Baltic countries can continue to work together to strengthen 
their collective security.
