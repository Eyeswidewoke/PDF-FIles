2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In November 2015 our board of directors adopted, and we expect our stockholders will approve prior to the completion of this 
offering, our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). We expect that our ESPP will be effective on the business day 
immediately prior to the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. We believe that allowing 
our employees to participate in our ESPP provides them with a further incentive towards ensuring our success and accomplishing 
our corporate goals.

A total of 4,200,000 shares of our Class A common stock will be available for sale under our ESPP. 
The number of shares of our Class A common stock available for sale under our ESPP will also include an annual increase on the 
first day of each fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2016, equal to the least of: 
• 8,400,000 shares;

Table of Content; 
• 1% of the outstanding shares of all classes of our common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal 
year: or 
• such other amount as our board of directors may determine. 
Plan Administration. 
The compensation committee of our board of directors will administer our ESPP and will have full but 
non-exclusive authority to interpret the terms of our ESPP and determine eligibility to participate. subject to the conditions of our 
ESPP. as described below. 
Eligibility. 
Generally, all employees of ours or any of our participating subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in our ESPP 
if they meet the eligibility requirements. However, an employee may not be granted rights to purchase shares of our Class A 
common stock under our ESPP if such employee: 
• immediately after the grant would own capital stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of 
all classes of our capital stock; or 
• hold rights to purchase shares of our common stock under all of our employee stock purchase plans that accrue at a rate 
that exceeds $25,000 worth of shares of our common stock for each calendar year. 
Offering Periods. 
Our ESPP includes a component that allows us to make offerings intended to qualify under Section 423 
of the Code and a component that allows us to make offerings not intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code to participants 
of designated companies, as described in our ESPP. Our ESPP provides for 12-month offering periods. The offering periods will be 
scheduled to start on the first trading day on or after May 15 and November 15 of each year, except for the first offering period, 
which will commence on the effectiveness of this Registration Statement and will end on the last trading day on or before 
November 15, 2016. Each offering period will include purchase periods, which will be the approximately 6-month period
