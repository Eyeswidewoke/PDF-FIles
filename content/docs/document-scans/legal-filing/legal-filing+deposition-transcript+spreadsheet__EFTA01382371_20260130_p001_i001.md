Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Tribk of Contents 
42-month period beginning on March 21, 2013. We paid annual management fees under the 3rd MR AB LLC Agreement totaling $6 
million for fiscal 2013 and S6 million for fiscal 2014. In connection with the Safeway acquisition, the 3rd A&R AB LLC Agreement was 
amended and restated. Pursuant to the fourth amended and restated limited liability company agreement of AB Acquisition LLC (the "4th 
A&R AB LLC Agreement"), we paid the Cerberus-led Consortium the remaining $9 million in annual management fees provided for by 
the 3rd A&R AB LLC Agreement. 
The 4th A&R AB LLC Agreement provides for the Cerberus-led Consortium to receive annual management fees of $1 3.75 million 
from our company over a 48-month period beginning on January 30, 2015, the date of the consummation of the Safeway acquisition. We 
have paid management fees to the Cerberus-led Consortium totaling $13.75 million for fiscal 2015. In exchange for the management 
fees, the Cerberus-led Consortium has provided strategic advice to management, including with respect to acquisitions and financings. 
As of June 20, 2015, management fees over the remainder of the 48-month period total $41.25 million. Consistent with the terms of the 
4th A&R AB LLC Agreement, the remaining management fees will be paid in full upon the closing of this offering. We do not expect to 
pay any further management fees to the Cerberus-led Consortium following the completion of this offering. 
Management Loans 
In connection with the Safeway acquisition, on January 30, 2015, we provided loans (the "Management Loans") to nine members 
of our management to enable them to invest in equity of AB Acquisition. Other than the loan to Robert Butler, who retired in December 
2014 as our Chief Operating Officer, the Management Loans were repaid in full on July 2. 2015 from the proceeds of loans provided to 
Management Holdco by Goldman Sachs Bank USA and secured by a pledge of the equity owned by Management Holdco. The table
