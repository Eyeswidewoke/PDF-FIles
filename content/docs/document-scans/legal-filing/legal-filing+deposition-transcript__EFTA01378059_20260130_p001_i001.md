the dividends are effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, if an income tax treaty 
applies, are attributable to a permanent establishment of the non-U.S. holder within the United States). A distribution will constitute a dividend for V.S. federal 
income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any distribution not 
constituting a dividend will be treated as first reducing the adjusted basis in the non-U. S. holders shares of our common stock and, to the extent it exceeds 
the adjusted basis in the non-U.S. holders shares of our common stock, as gain from the sale or exchange of such shares. 
Dividends effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, attnbutable to a U.S. permanent establishment) of a non-
U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax if the non-U.S. holder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements. 
Instead, such dividends generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis, in the same manner as if the non-U.S. holder were a 
resident of the United States. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate 
as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its "effectively connected earnings and profits," subject to certain adjustments. 
Gain on sale or other disposition of our common stock 
In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or, subject to the discussion below under the heading "Information Reporting and 
Backup Wthholding" and 'Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act." withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our common stock 
unless: 
• 
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. holder within the United States and, if required by an applicable 
income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of the non-U.S. holder: 
the non-U.S. holder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other 
conditions are satisfied: or 
we are or have been a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter of the five-year period 
ending on the date of the disposition and the non-U.S. holders holding period and certain other conditions are satisfied. 
Gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, net of 
certain deductions, at regular U.S. federal Income tax rates. If the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, the branch profits tax described above also may 
apply to such effectively connected gain. An individual non-U.S. holder who is subject to U.S. federal 
ISO 
Table of Conteral 
income tax because the non-U.S. holder was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the year of sale or other disposition of our common 
stock will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from such sale or other disposition, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. 
Information reporting and backup withholding 
We must report annually to the Internal Revenue Service and to each non-U.S. holder the amount of dividends paid to, and the tax withheld with respect to, 
each non-U.S. holder. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. Copies of 
this information also may be made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which the non-
U.S. holder resides or is established. 
U.S. backup withholding tax (currently, at a rate of 28%) is imposed on certain payments to persons that fail to furnish the information required under the U.S. 
information reporting rules. Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder generally will be exempt from backup withholding if the non-U.S. holder provides a properly 
executed IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or otherwise establishes an exemption. 
Under U.S. Treasury regulations. the payment of proceeds from the disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder effected at a U.S. office of a broker 
generally will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding, unless the beneficial owner, under penalties of perjury. certifies, among other things. 
its status as a non-U.S. holder or otherwise establishes an exemption. The payment of proceeds from the disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. 
holder effected at a non-U.S. office of a broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding and information reporting, except as noted below. In the 
case of proceeds from a disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder effected at a non-U.S. office of a broker that is: 
a U.S. person: 
a "controlled foreign corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes: 
a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income from certain periods is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business: or 
a foreign partnership if at any time during its tax year (a) one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who, in the aggregate, hold more than 50% of 
the income or capital interests of the partnership or (b) the foreign partnership is engaged in a U.S. trade or business: 
information reporting will apply unless the broker has documentary evidence in its files that the owner is a non-U.S. holder and certain other conditions are 
satisfied, or the beneficial owner otherwise establishes an exemption (and the broker has no knowledge or reason to know to the contrary). Backup 
withholding will apply if the sale is subject to information reporting and the broker has actual knowledge that you are a United States person. 
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-U.S. holder can be refunded 
or credited against the non-U.S. holders U.S. federal income tax habil-fly, if any, provided that the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue 
Service in a timely manner.
