NASA will test an air-launched system in 2016 with Generation Orbit, an Atlanta company. It 
uses a Gulfstream G-IV executive jet to carry aloft a rocket which it fires off to put 45-50kg 
a loads into low-Earth orbit.

Neither Generation Orbit or Virgin Galactic may come down much on price, as both see a profit 
to be made in offering regular launches, even weekly ones. Operators whose nanosats ride 
shotgun as ballast in other missions do not have much control over when they launch or the 
orbits they reach, says William Pomerantz, the head of special projects at Virgin Galactic. John 
Olds, boss of Generation Orbit, says that as constellations of nanosats increase, placing them in a 
precise orbit will be critical in keeping small-satellite networks operating. 
The nanosat wars 
Nanosats also face two other limiting factors: communications and propulsion. Those used for 
academic work principally rely on amateur-radio frequencies, with basic equipment squeezed 
into the CubeSat form. Transmission and reception are further hindered by the size of antennae 
or dishes, both on the ground and on the satellites. Many academic projects set up their own 
listening stations and recruit space buffs who can use inexpensive kit, but these work on an 
informal basis. Companies tend to use licensed frequencies and plump for more expensive radio 
gear to handle their data flows. More development in communications equipment and investment 
in ground stations would improve things. 
The other bugbear, propulsion, is harder to solve. Currently, launch operators can prevent 
nanosats carrying hazardous propellants that might be used to power them to another orbit. Nor 
have engineers had a reason to design tiny spaceship engines using safer fuel. But they do now. 
Even a basic capability to push in one direction would allow nanosats to remain in orbit longer, 
or allow a satellite that has been placed into low-Earth orbit, using an inexpensive launch 
provider, to nudge itself to a higher geostationary orbit. And some might travel far beyond 
Earth. 
Benjamin Longmier of the University of Michigan and founder of Aether Industries, which 
makes equipment for high-altitude research, has begun production of a nanosat propulsion 
system based on his previous work at the Johnson Space Centre in Texas. This is a rocket that 
uses ionised propellants accelerated by magnetic fields. He has been able to scale this down to 
CubeSat size, using liquid water or solid iodine as the propellant. Dr Longmier says the system 
could allow a constellation of satellites to remain in the correct position relative to one another, 
move satellites to polar orbit from less-expensive launch insertions or increase an orbit. 
Surrey Satellite Technology's STRaND-1 also contained a couple of experimental propulsion 
systems. One is a re-entry device that ejects a mixture of water and alcohol to tip the nanosat out 
of orbit at the end of its useful life. The other is an array of pulsed-plasma thrusters which heat 
and evaporate a material to produce a charged gas to push the satellite along. 
NASA has plans to offer a $5m prize using a six-unit CubeSat for groups to demonstrate ways 
both to communicate across large distances and display the effective use of unconventional
