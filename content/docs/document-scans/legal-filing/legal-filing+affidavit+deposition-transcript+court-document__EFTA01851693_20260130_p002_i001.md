you may give it away and enjoy the process. you said that 50 mliion 
should go the Israeli equivablent of a rhodes scholarship program that 
itamar would help structure. 50 million to columbia to pay salaries 
of the brain researchers. all houses planes shoudl be sold and only 
the new york apt kept as rene was comfortable there. . You 
suggested the Daily news and us news should be sold. , the printing 
press should be closed. and sold. ( if possible without a bankriutpcy. 
). you will most lilely leave bxp in december . and thought that Rand 
R would be more valuable in the future. . We agreed gthat giving 
such large suns away should and would be your main focus, 
Seperate and aprt form the recent will change. that was done by ellen 
harrison , terms of which you were fuzzy on, you wanted alan 
duglash to get into the nitty gritty of the tax returns. you thought 
that in the interim media was well magened by holliber, . and real 
csatc by 
 You wanted jamie to be involved in the distribution of 
funds but suggested he was not capable of fully understanding the 
issues and the complexity. You told me that you recognized that 
your capability to deal with this was only decreasing, and wanted a 
team to be fully responsbilte and that you acknowledgged that you 
were not able to truly follow its progression so that you prefered to 
delegate with as much protection as possible the people involved. so 
that they could operate with a free but watched hand. I told you that 
I prefer not to be involved but if you again chose to bite the bullet, I 
would sell all the investments . all. restructure all the trusts. all. and 
direct the monentization of the bxp position. Im not sure if you will 
again change your mind, but must protect myself and the people you 
have asked me to get involved. Your foundation will have to be 
staffed as well. Again I reiterated that 40 million up front paid by 
tranfereing bxp stock or assigning part of your investemnt portfolio! 
would be ok, as long as we could secure it. I rccognzicd that cash 
flow was your concern and said we would find a way, but would 
only do so with other peoples involvement so as to confirm your 
desires. 
I am a friend , I would like to do as you ask, but as you have changed your mind 
more than once , I remain available.. Rccogznig yesterday , that 
you were no longer able to deal with these issues, and wanted help, 
and as i suggested we might need to get a judge or other legal sign 
off, to validate any arrangement as you might tend to forget in the 
future , I wish you will.
