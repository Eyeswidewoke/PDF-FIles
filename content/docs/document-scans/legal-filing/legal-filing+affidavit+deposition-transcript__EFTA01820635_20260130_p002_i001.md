million-square-meter waterfront development adjacent to Dubai Marina, notable for the building 
depicted on promotional drawings which resembled a donut standing on end. It was clear to 
anyone who visited the construction site in the spring that work had come to a halt. 
Not a crane, truck or bulldozer was to be found on the vast expanse of reclaimed land, and even 
the on-site offices had been cleared of everything but the furniture. Dubai Promenade's Web site 
still promises "a sophisticated waterfront community" with "breathtaking vistas from every 
direction" as though the Dubai property boom was still in full swing. 
In previous years, words such as those lured lenders like flies to honey, but during the first half of 
2009, holders of Nakheel sukuk certificates began to get skittish about how the company would 
pay off its $3.52 billion in obligations due in December, sending the price plummeting. 
Sentiment began rebounding over the summer, with investors becoming more bullish on Nakheel, 
on Dubai as a whole, and on the Gulf in general. By August, Nakheel's sukuk price had risen 46 
percent from its February low of63.5 cents on the dollar, a movement Abu Dhabi daily The 
National called "one of the clearest indications yet that Dubai is getting the upper hand on the 
financial crisis." 
Markets had watched the issue as an indicator of how the Dubai government would handle the 
emirate's $80 billion-plus debt load, and it was gradually becoming clear that the government 
would not allow Nakheel to default, aided as it was by the UAE central bank, which came to the 
rescue earlier this year by buying at least $10 billion of Dubai's $20 billion bond issue. 
Whatever Nakheel's woes, there's still plenty of money to go around. 
In August, Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its 2010 growth forecast for the GCC from 3.2 
percent to 3.7 percent, reflecting growing confidence that the region would emerge from the 
economic downturn faster and stronger than it had previously expected. Although the bank's 
forecast for 2009 growth remained below market consensus at -1 percent, it laid out a case for 
renewed bullishness next year. 
For one thing, oil prices are likely to remain high, leading to sustained budget surpluses. Even at 
the worst of times around the New Year, oil only dipped to $35 a barrel, relatively high compared 
to prior downturns, and going into the fourth quarter of 2009 it was trading at roughly double 
that, close to the $75 per barrel deemed a "fair price" by the leaders of the region's biggest 
producer, Saudi Arabia. 
"There is a kind of consensus - we're not there yet, but we will be in a few months time - that oil 
prices are going to be much higher than in any previous recession," says Turker Hamzaoglu, an 
analyst for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. "When oil exceeds $65 per barrel, which is 
our average budget breakeven forecast for the GCC, these countries start saving. 
Since we see oil prices at $64 at the end of this year and $82 the next, this is definitely going to 
be supportive of fiscal balances."
