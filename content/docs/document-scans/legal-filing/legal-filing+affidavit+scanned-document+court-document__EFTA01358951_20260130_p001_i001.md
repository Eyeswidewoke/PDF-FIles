889 F.3d 116, *; 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 11909, *" 
for anything beyond the shipping-and-handling costs associated with the trial offer." Id. at 312: see also Van Dyke. 605 F.2d at 
224. Here. there is no allegation of such explicit deceit: the plaintiffs affirmatively consented to the fully-disclosed terms of the 
membership club offer, and do not dispute that those terms governed their relationship with Trilegiant. 
[HN8]The elements of mail and wire fraud must be pled with particularity. See Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 9(b); Lundy v. Catholic Health Sys. of Long Island, 711 F.3d 106, 119 (2d Cir. 
2013); Anatian v. Coutts Bank (Switzerland) Ltd., 193 F.3d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 1999). The 
complaint must detail the specific statements that are false or fraudulent, identify the 
speaker, state when and where the statements were made, and explain why the 
statements were fraudulent. Mills v. Polar Molecular Corp., 12 F.3d 1170, 1175 (2d Cir. 
1993); see, e.g., In re [9 25] Ford Fusion & C-Max Fuel Econ. Litig., 2015 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 155383, 2015 WL 7018369, at *33 (requiring plaintiffs [*.15] to "sufficiently allege 
the who, what, when, where, and why of the fraud at issue under Rule 9(b)"). 
The plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by requiring them to allege specific 
misrepresentations in the use of the mail or wires to satisfy Rule 9(b). Their theory is that 
even if Trilegiant made otherwise innocent use of the wires, it did so to advance an 
enterprise that was deceptive overall. E.g., Brewer v. Village of Old Field, 311 F. Supp. 2d 
390, 403 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (While the mailings themselves did not contain 
misrepresentations, "the complaint allege[d] a close connection between the defendants 
and the alleged fraudulent scheme" and the mails were "simply used in furtherance of a 
master plan to defraud."). 
True, [HN9] the mail or wire communications themselves need not contain a false 
statement. See Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 715, 109 S. Ct. 1443, 103 L. Ed. 
2d 734 (1989); see also SKS Constructors, Inc. v. Drinkwine, 458 F. Supp. 2d 68, 78 
(E.D.N.Y. 2006) (when alleging use of the mail and wires, "the pleader need only allege 
that the mail and wire fraud were in furtherance of a larger scheme to defraud" and "the 
communications themselves need not have contained false or misleading information") 
(internal quotations marks omitted); Calabrese v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 283 F. Supp. 2d 797, 
808 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) ("a detailed description of the underlying scheme and the connection 
therewith of the mail and/or wire communications" is sufficient to satisfy Rule 9(b)) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). ["16] But a plaintiff still needs to allege a material 
misrepresentation as part of the defendants' scheme to fraud to state a violation of section 
1341 or 1343. See O'Donnell, 822 F.3d at 657. That is so notwithstanding characterization 
of the alleged frauds as predicate acts of a racketeering conspiracy.' The complaint here 
lacks the particularized allegation of an underlying "scheme to defraud" animated by a 
material misrepresentation. 
6 IHN10I A valid claim that does riot rest on specific misrepresentations in the use of the mails or wires always identities fraud 
with particularity at some level of the enterprise. See. e.g.. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Blessinger. No. 06 CV 391(NGG)(ARL). 2007 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21781. 2007 WL 951905. at '7-8 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 27. 2007) (complaint specified how members of the 
conspiracy "submitted insurance applications to the plaintiff ... which contained false and incomplete information intended to 
mislead plaintiff." and "detail(ed) the nature of the false statements"); Wood y. Incorporated Village of Patchogue. 311 F. Supp. 
2d 344. 368.60 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (complaint included allegations that defendants made misrepresentations by submitting annual 
payroll statements certifying inaccurate information): SKS Constructors. 458 F. Supp. 2d at 76-78 (credit card charges and 
checks did not contain misrepresentations. bit the wrongdoing within the conspiracy included "wrongfully endorsed checks 
payable to XL and then deposited those checks in accounts for himself;" "purchased raw materials on credit while never 
intending to pay for those materials;" and 'fraudulently obtained' credit in others' names).
