Portfolio Manager's Summary: 
LTE proliferation and cheaper handsets push data demand around 
the globe, creating a buzz for infrastructure players 
The buzz returned this year to Mobile World Congress and we contributed as best we 
could, running between meetings, downing caf6 con leches and snacking on jamon 
sandwiches. What was different was the focus of the buzz, which if last year was 
centered on smartphone growth and LTE unit volumes, then this year it was 
infrastructure. Almost every network equipment vendor we met with sounded 
optimistic about operator spending in the year ahead. 
In terms of an overarching theme, OTT (Over The Top) took the spotlight as Facebook 
announced that Whatsapp would be launching voice services. Remember two years 
ago when carriers tried to launch RCS? Well this Facebook announcement was salt on 
the old wounds of that struggling attempt to compete with fast moving OTT vendors. 
Nevertheless. what the announcement does highlight in a positive sense is that carriers 
will likely be pushed to offer better coverage and capacity as we move forward. There 
were other themes, which, while not as oven as OTT, will likely have ramifications for 
players around the industry. Specifically: a continued race in the baseband space - there 
is still no clear number two behind Qualcomm here, the frontend industry consolidation, 
LTE deployment acceleration, Firefox redefining the cheap smartphone and the struggle 
to differentiate in high end handsets. 
Our key takeaways. 
• 
State of the Baseband - number two still undecided: As most of our readers 
know, we suggested a few months ago that Qualcomm would see little 
competition in 2014. In short, Mobile World Congress only reinforced this 
viewpoint. In Barcelona we met with most of the merchant baseband players 
and a number of industry contacts across the handset foodchain, and what is 
increasingly clear to us, is that this year the fight will be for a foothold, in hopes 
to make a play for meaningful volume, and the second spot, behind Qualcomm 
in 2015. While we have argued that Mediatek was the clear number two 
behind Qualcomm (they remain so in unit volumes and profits), this point has 
been muddied a bit by the mixed progress in LTE of a few others and what we 
feel are challenges in LTE for Mediatek. 
• 
Smanphones - high end struggles to differentiate, while Firefox redefines 
cheap: It is strikingly obvious that differentiating on the high-end with 
hardware is limited. Every major handset OEM at the show had shiny new 
handsets (and tablets), as well as a wearable to go along with it. The good 
news for many across the globe is that smartphones are only getting cheaper. 
Firefox (Mozilla) took this one step further, introducing a $25 smartphone at the 
show. The phone runs on a 1 Ghz application processor, and has a Spreadtrum 
2G GSM/Edge baseband and WiFi connectivity. We were able to demo the 
device, which we felt was a large improvement on the year before, when they 
had the OS running on a more expensive 800 mhz processor. Ubuntu also was 
demonstrating an interesting multimedia OS which was improved from last 
year and eliminates any physical buttons on the screen.
