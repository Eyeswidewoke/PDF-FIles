experts, boosting their role. We also want 
to reinforce our commitment to allocate 
other core competences to each location, 
something which will be reflected in our 
marketing approach. 
What is special about Deutsche AWM's 
investment process? 
I think that we can be really proud of 
what we have already achieved, for our 
investment process is unprecedented 
in this sector. Partly, this is simply due 
to our size which allows us to employ a 
wide range of investment experts who 
are active all over the globe. With roughly 
750 billion euros under management. 
we are among the twenty largest asset 
managers world-wide. if you consider 
only actively managed assets, which 
is more meaningful when it comes to 
investment expertise, we are among the 
top ten.' Another factor Is our structured 
investment process ensuring that the 
opinions of our individual experts are 
aggregated into a common macro picture 
and a coherent asset allocation. 
How, exactly, does this work? 
Our investment process has four 
components. The basis is provided 
by our experts' fundamental analysis 
which results in recommendations on 
individual assets. This revolves around 
the continuous interaction of our 
specialists with each other as well as 
with economists, strategists and regional 
ClOs. The second step is the aggregation 
of these individual recommendations 
by portfolio construction teams into 
model portfolios. In a third step, these 
model portfolios are adjusted according 
to the restrictions and requirements 
of individual clients by our portfolio 
managers. In the last and fourth step, our 
quality management continuously verifies 
whether these actual portfolios are- in 
line with our strategy efficiently and 
timely managed within the agreed risk 
frame. 
' Investment & Pensions Europe; 
year-end 2014 data 
Let's get down to details now. What 
strategy could a German middle-aged 
investor with an average risk appetite and 
100,000 euros follow in 2016? 
First of all, let me say that fixing realistic 
return targets can save a lot of headaches. 
My targets may sound conservative 
but I am happy with an average of 4 
percent. In recent years, this could be 
achieved quite easily with investment-
grade bonds but this will change in 
2016. I might suggest a so-called barbell 
strategy now. In a nutshell, you buy the 
most basic things in a discount store and 
everything else in delicatessens, skipping 
the middle segment. This means I would 
try to safeguard the major part of returns 
via more risky assets, possibly via sound 
European equities as well as U.S. and 
euro high-yield debt. This would be the 
delicatessen. The remainder should come 
from investments in short-dated 
fixed-income papers to secure 
liquidity at low volatility. So that 
outlines a typical investment 
strategy for this class of 
investor, which, of course, 
would also depend on an 
individual's specific investment 
profile. 
To be continued 
Almost exactly on its third anniversary, 
Deutsche AWM is taking another 
important step forward. Major pans of 
wealth management will be incorporated 
into the German retail business (both 
private and business clients) making 
possible a more uniform client dialog. 
Apart from that, I will, as new CIO, lead an 
asset-management unit which will build 
on our recent achievements, continuously 
learning and improving.
