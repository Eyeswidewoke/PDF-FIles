Facebook (Sell): habits are changing. There may be trouble ahead 
A new survey released by eMarketer on Friday shows that for US users who are sharing less with friends 
and family on the platform it is often because of trust. 47% of such respondents said that the reason was 
due to privacy concerns. It comes after a Gallup poll last month showed that 43% of Facebook users 
were very worried about the invasion of privacy. Now this may not manifest into platform behaviour 
changes yet but the first effect could be to see slowing DAU/MAU metrics and lower engagement. In turn, 
this could lead to marketers questioning the digital ROI of the platform. As we mentioned last week, we 
see evidence of Twitter attempting to capitalise by introducing a new timeline ad campaign for publishers 
as the company shifts deeper into programmatic ads.

Zynga (Buy): complementary deal and margin uplift ahead 
The key push v pull argument on Zynga has been on how the company will get to a stated aim of a 20% 
adjusted EBITDA margin. The company is executing on the progress of the same and this week's 
acquisition of Gram Games should help achieve that target with projected EBITDA contribution of $12M 
in 2018 and $20M in 2019. The price of the deal at $250M seems reasonable and will bring in a 75 
person studio in London and Istanbul that fits into the Zynga strategy of connecting interactive 
entertainment with players. Gram has success in building hyper-casual games and Merge games. The 
Merge series uses the mechanic of merging two puzzle pieces together to solve a puzzle and is a 
mechanic that makes free-to-play games easy and addictive. 
The strategic shift towards live services is paying off, with frequent content updates driving higher 
average revenue per user and engagement. Audience numbers are on the rise with DAU's up +19% YoY 
and MAU's +30% YoY. Zynga guided O2 adjusted EBITDA to $37M above consensus (Factset) $35.7M, 
and the Q2 guidance implies the company is on track with adjusted EBITDA margin of 18% expected for 
Q2. Zynga has now delivered EBITDA upside for eight straight quarters.

Salesforce.com (Buy): no slowing in sight 
Salesforce.com, despite high expectations, still managed to beat and raise. 1O revenue of $$3.01B was 
ahead of consensus (Factset) $2.946 driven by subscription beat ($.281B above $2.73B expected), Non 
GAAP OM of 17.1% 190bps above street. Raise FY guidance for revenues of $13.075-$13.125B and 
EPS of $2.2942.31 above consensus $12.73B and $2.12. Company revenue run rate of $12B/year, 
growing 25% YoY. A quite remarkable feat — we remember when it reached $16 in 2009 and $5B in 
2014. Artificial Intelligence, through its Einstein assistant, is delivering nearly 2 billion predictions every 
day and its ease of use is seen as key driver of adoption. This is almost double the number in February 
and the ability to include custom sales and service forecasting in the predictive analytics can only help 
further embed salesforce CRM in customers' spending priorities.
