2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
warranty extension -- along with monetary awards that will not be calculated in the 
aggregate until all claim submission periods have ended and Defendants have processed 
the claims. ECF No. 86 at 18. 
2. The lodestar calculation supports an award of between $1,917,673.40 and 
$2,320,000 in fees and expenses 
Plaintiffs seek attorneys' fees and expenses in the total amount of $2,320,000, which is 
31.5 percent less than their lodestar calculation of $3,387,328.75. ECF No. 86 at 22.' 
Defendants do not argue that Class Counsel is entitled to less than the lodestar amount, 
but instead argue that Plaintiffs' $3,387,328.75 lodestar calculation is itself incorrect, based 
on unreasonably high billing rates and insufficient documentation of the hours reportedly 
billed by Class Counsel. ECF No. 90 at 1. 
3 In their reply brief in further support of their motion for attorneys' fees. Plaintiffs submit that this sum has increased by an 
additional $113.606. ECF No. 105 at 1. 1 n.1 (citing Norton v. Wilshire Credit Corp.. 36 F. Supp. 2d 216. 219 (D.N.J. 1999) 
("Prevailing parties may also collect reasonable attorney's fees for time spent preparing the fee petition?) (citing Institutionalized 
Juveniles v. Secretary of Pub. Welfare, 758 F.2d 897. 92425 (3d Cir. 1985)). Because Defendants r82) address the hours 
and billing rates reported in Plaintiffs' original motion, and because this calculation adequately supports the award Plaintiffs 
seek. the Court performs its analysis using the hours and billing rates reported in the original motion. 
The Court calculates the lodestar amount by multiplying the number of hours "reasonably 
worked" on a client's case by a "reasonable hourly billing rate for such services based on 
the given geographical area, the nature of the services provided, and the experience of the 
attorneys." Ins. Brokerage, 579 F.3d at 280 (quoting Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 302). "To 
examine the lodestar factor properly, a Court should make explicit findings about how 
much time counsel reasonably devoted to a given matter, and what a reasonable hourly 
fee would be for such services." Gunter v. Ridgewood Energy Corp., 223 F.3d 190, 199-
200 (3d Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). 
With regard to the hours worked by class counsel, the court may exclude from its 
calculation hours that are "not reasonably expended," such as hours attributable to over-
staffing, hours that appear excessive in light of the experience and skill of the lawyers, and 
hours that are redundant or otherwise unnecessary, as well as hours that are not 
"adequately documented." Norton v. Wilshire Credit Corp., 36 F. Supp. 2d 216, 219 (D.N.J. 
1999) (Walls, J.) (citing Hensley at 433-34). Although a "fee petition should ["63] include 
'some fairly definite information as to the hours devoted to various general activities, e.g., 
pretrial discovery, settlement negotiations and the hours spent by various classes of 
attorneys, e.g., senior partners, junior partners, associates," Rode, 892 F.2d at 1190 
(quoting Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Phila. v. American Radiatory & Standard Sanatory 
Corp., 487 F.2d 161, 167 (3d Cir. 1973)), "it is not necessary to know the exact number of 
minutes spent nor the precise activity to which each hour was devoted nor the specific 
attainments of each attorney." Id. 
To determine whether an attorney's billing rate is reasonable, a court "should assess the 
experience and skill of the prevailing party's attorneys and compare their rates to the rates 
prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, 
experience, and reputation." Id. (citations omitted).
