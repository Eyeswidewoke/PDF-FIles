Office other than its bead or home office represents to arid agrees with the other party that, notwithstanding the place 
of booking or its jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation, its obligations are the same in terms of recourse against 
it as if it had entered into the Transaction through its head or home office, except that a party will not have recourse 
to the head or home office of the other party in respect of any payment or delivery deferred pursuant to Section 5(d)

relevant Confirmation or as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, and, if an Office for that party is not specified

otherwise agree in writing, the Office through which a party enters into a Transaction will also be the Office in which 
it books the Transaction and the Office through which it makes and receives payments and deliveries with respect to 
the Transaction. Subject to Section 6(bXii), neither party may change the Office in which it books the Transaction or
