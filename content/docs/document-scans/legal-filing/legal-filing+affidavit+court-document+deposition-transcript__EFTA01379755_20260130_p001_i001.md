[1803-13] All ER Rep 178; Also reported 14 Ves 341; 33 ER 552 
touching the validity of the will was determined; and that he is, therefore, in sufficient time. 
To that it is answered that if there is no breach of the condition, there is no occasion to 
come into a court of equity: besides, that it was by the plaintiffs own act that the probate 
was delayed so long; and it may be doubted whether it would be competent to him to take 
advantage of his own groundless resistance to the proof of the will. 
But it is said, this court relieves against forfeiture, and breaches of condition. To that it was 
answered by the defendants that this is not a mere breach of condition, but a conditional 
limitation over in a given event; and, where there is a devise over to any other than that 
person who would by disposition of law take the estate, the court never relieves and for 
that distinction Cage v Russel (1) was referred to That this is a conditional limitation, and 
not a mere condition, is clear from Avelyn v Ward (2) The question there was not of the 
same kind, but the limitation in the will was precisely the same as this: a limitation to the 
heir-at-law upon condition of giving a release within a certain period; and that was held a 
conditional limitation 
not a strict condition. If this be a conditional limitation, it seems to follow that the event 
having taken place, the court cannot possibly relieve. Though the estate is given over to 
the executrix, who would have been benefited by the release, yet it is a real estate, which 
she could not take as executrix; and, therefore, the circumstance that she is so makes no 
difference. 
It is then contended upon the case of Earl of Northumberland v Earl of Aylesford (3) that 
Michael Simpson by entering into possession of the devised estate was obliged upon the 
doctrine of election to make the release, when called upon to do so, and, therefore, it is to 
be considered as executed. In that case Algernon never did release his claim: but it was 
decreed that his executors should then execute a release: as, by taking the benefit he had 
contracted the obligation to execute it. But the circumstances of this case are not the 
same, for Michael Simpson cannot be considered as possessing the estate under the 
devise. He was the heir-at-law. He entered, contesting the will. During that time he cannot 
be considered in possession as devisee. Afterwards, when the question was determined, 
he offers a release; but clogged with a condition that it should be accepted within three 
days; which implied that if that condition was not complied with, he would hold adversely to 
the will, and as no longer bound to comply with those terms. 
This is quite different, therefore, from that case, where the possession taken could be 
ascribed to nothing but the will. Besides, that decision is materially shaken by Lord 
Beaulieu v Lord Cardigan (4) in the House of Lords, which had been determined by LORD 
NORTH INGTON upon the same principle and in the same way: viz, that the estate should 
go, as if it had been actually settled according to the condition. The House of Lords, 
however, declared that the estate not being settled pursuant to the condition, the devise 
made on that condition did not take effect. 
That applies precisely to this case. Michael Simpson not having complied with the 
condition of giving a release of all claims upon Elizabeth Simpson is not entitled to the 
benefit of the devise, made upon that condition. There is no doubt that he is entitled to an
