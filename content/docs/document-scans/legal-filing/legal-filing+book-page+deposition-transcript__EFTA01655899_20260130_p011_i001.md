their money growing, convincing them to invest more. But the apps were fraudulent; and after milking all they 
could, the accused would allegedly run off with their victims' money — what's known as a pig butchering scam. The 
article stated that the FBI said it had so far identified "approximately 120 victims with losses of approximately 
$9,547,180 associated with this schemer according to a search warrant for the suspects' cryptocurrency wallets. 
Individual victims were losing between $100,000 and over $800,000 each to the fraudsters, the court documents 
show. In 2022, Chen and Xu bought a house in Frisco valued by Zillow at $1.5 million; they own another property in 
Allen, Texas, and drove in a $100,000 Porsche Cayenne, the FBI said. The article added that the FBI had been 
chasing the couple since 2021 and had acquired access to their Google and Binance accounts as they prepared to 
file the charges in June, the documents show. But the family managed to leave the country earlier this year and 
have not returned. In January, Chen, Xu and their two children received new Chinese passports from the Chinese 
Consulate in Houston, Texas, bought tickets to go to China and departed three days later, the court documents 
show. They later liquidated their assets in the U.S., according to the government narrative.

LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES 
Illinois Assault Weapons Ban Triggers Gun Buying Boom, FBI Data Shows 
Patch (08/12, Meadows) reported that following last year's passage of a statewide ban on assault weapons and 
large-capacity magazines, Illinoisans responded by purchasing more guns than ever. The article stated that legal 
gun sales in Illinois increased by 5 percent from 2022 to 2023, marking the second-largest increase in the nation, 
according to FBI data compiled by SafeHome. Using data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check 
System to reflect the number of background checks conducted for firearm purchases, the home security 
organization reported 504,452 firearms were sold in Illinois last year. The article noted that the increase in gun 
sales comes after Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the Protect Illinois Communities Act in January 2023. Drawn up in the 
wake of the Highland Park shooting the year before, the law defined assault weapons, banned their sale and 
limited magazine capacity to 15 rounds for pistols and 10 for long guns. The majority of 2023 gun purchases in 
Illinois came in the months that followed the new law, which included provisions requiring the registration of 
existing assault weapons with state police by the start of this year.

International Investigation Leads to Shutdown of Ransomware Group 
The Record (08/12, Greig) reported that the FBI announced the takedown of the Radar/Dispossessor ransomware 
operation on Monday, confirming that dozens of servers across the U.S. and Europe were "dismantled." The group 
— which some researchers believe was started by former affiliates of the LockBit ransomware enterprise — has 
listed dozens of victims since emerging last year. Last month, members of the group told DataBreaches.net about a 
purported attack on Richard Parish Hospital in Louisiana that was never confirmed by the hospital. According to the 
article, on Monday, the FBI's Cleveland office said the group is led by a hacker going by the moniker "Brain" and 
that law enforcement officials took down three servers in the U.S., three in the U.K., and 18 in Germany. Eight 
domains registered in the U.S. and one in Germany were also taken down by the FBI. The article noted that in a 
statement, the FBI said Radar/Dispossessor has existed since August 2023 and focused on targeting small to mid-
sized businesses and organizations. FBI officials said their investigation discovered that 43 companies were 
attacked by the group from across the U.S., South America, India, Europe, the United Arab Emirates, and 
elsewhere. The group primarily went after companies and organizations in the education, healthcare, financial 
services, and transportation sectors. The ransomware gang operated like most others, according to the FBI, 
breaching networks and stealing data before encrypting systems. The FBI warned the total number of businesses 
and organizations affected is yet to be determined because many ransomware operations have variants used by 
affiliates. The article quoted the FBI, who said, "The FBI encourages those with information about Brain or Radar 
Ransomware, or if their business or organization has been a target or victim of ransomware or currently paying a 
criminal actor, to contact its Internet Crime Complaint Center." The article mentioned that the operation was 
conducted alongside the DOJ, the U.K.'s National Crime Agency, and law enforcement in Germany. WJW (Fox-8)
