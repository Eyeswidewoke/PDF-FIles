US Equity Insights 
Bank stocks represent shareholders equity or residual real assets 
that are used to intermediate nominal assets and liabilities 
Bank stocks represent real entities with earnings that should rise with inflation. A bank, 
like any other business, should be valued based upon all of its future cash flows. Just 
like any business, a bank's earnings and dividends should grow with inflation over the 
long-term even if none of its earnings are retained for reinvestment. Thus, just like any 
business, a fair PE on a bank's steady-state EPS is 1 /real cost of equity and a fair PB on 
a bank's steady-state book value is its sustainable nominal ROE / real cost of equity. 
Although a bank's earnings should grow with inflation over the long-term, it is 
important to acknowledge that a bank's earnings are subject to the risk of unexpected 
inflationary/deflationary shocks. Abrupt changes in inflation expectations and/or 
inflation risk premiums and real interest rates, relative to the rates of return embedded 
in the income producing assets that a bank holds, or embedded in the rates of return of 
liabilities that a bank issues, can damage a bank's earnings power for the period of time 
it takes for any duration mismatch between its assets and liabilities to elapse. This issue 
along with leverage affects the path to normal EPS and real cost of capital (risk), but not 
the terminal value calculation. The perpetual growth rate of a bank's earnings should 
include inflation, i.e., its terminal value capitalization rate should be a real rate. 
The risk of change in the cost of capital relative to returns earned on assets is a risk that 
all businesses bear. Although this is generally a more significant risk for banks as 
relatively small interest rate changes (typical volatility) can significantly impact near-
term EPS as amplified by leverage. However, banks are generally capable of adapting 
to secular interest rate shifts quicker than non-financial companies. What we mean is 
that the return that a bank earns will usually follow changes in the cost of capital more 
quickly up or down than non-financial companies. In a valuation sense, particularly for 
terminal value, banks are shorter duration than businesses that have more sticky 
returns relative to any cost of capital change. Businesses with sticky returns, especially 
if such returns are well above the cost of capital, are longer-duration equities. Long 
duration equities benefit in value from secular declines in capital costs, but suffer upon 
a secular climb in capital costs as the drivers of their returns are more independent. 
More on why a bank's long-term EPS should grow with inflation 
Retained earnings should be in assets producing returns inclusive of evpec loci inflation 
The retained earnings at banks represent many real assets, such as property, 
equipment, accumulated marketing, etc.; but much of it will be in nominal assets like 
loans and securities that make up most of the bank's assets. These nominal assets 
should produce returns that include an expected inflation rate. As discussed above, risk 
stems from changes in inflation from what is embedded in the returns from assets held. 
For non-financial businesses, the ability to grow earnings and dividends with inflation 
even when no earnings are retained for reinvestment comes from the rising cost of 
replacing the real assets that underlie earnings. Thus, in order to keep the return on 
capital constant on the real value of capital employed prices need to rise with inflation. 
It might seem that raising prices on a constant capital base produces perpetually rising 
economic profits, but if the capital base is carried with an inflation adjustment then the 
return on capital stays constant. For businesses that are highly competitive with returns 
close to the cost of capital all this occurs via market forces. This is typical for 
commodity producers and other highly competitive or regulated businesses. This is why 
Energy and Utilities stocks are usually among the more effective inflation hedges.
