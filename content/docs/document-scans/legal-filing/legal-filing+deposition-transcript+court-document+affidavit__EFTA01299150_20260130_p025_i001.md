509 F. Supp. 815, *; 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11119, **; 
1981-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P64,165 
(1977); Bruce v. Wade, 537 F.2d 850 (5th Cir. 1976); Williams v. McCall, 531 F.2d 1247 
(5th Cir. 1976); Cook v. Whiteside, 505 F.2d 32 (5th Cir. 1974). Indeed, the Court finds 
plaintiffs Amended Complaint to be rather skillfully drafted when considering the complex 
issues raised and the fact that plaintiff has no prior legal experience. 
3. Although these cases al arise in the context of prisoner pro se pleadings, the same standard should apply to a nonposoner 
plaintiff where he chooses to proceed m his own behalf. 
[""7] Following the guidance of these fundamental principles, the Court has conducted a 
careful review of the Amended Complaint and concludes that plaintiff is unable to state a 
claim upon which relief can be granted as to that portion of the Amended Complaint 
asserting violations of his civil rights. As for the remainder of the Amended Complaint 
alleging antitrust violations, [119] the Court concludes that it would be premature to 
dismiss at the present stage of the proceedings. A discussion of the rationale behind this 
determination is in order. 
II. GENERAL PLEADING REQUIREMENTS 
[HN4] Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) enunciates the general standard that a pleading must meet in 
order to withstand a motion to dismiss. The pleader is entitled to considerable latitude 
regarding the mode of stating his claim for relief, provided the pleading gives reasonable 
notice of the claim or claims asserted. The Court considers the Amended Complaint 
amply sufficient to meet the general notice requirements of Rule 8 by adequately setting 
forth a claim and giving the defendants fair notice of its basis. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 
41, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957); 5 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and [nEl] 
Procedure : Civil §§ 1216, 1217, 1286 (1969). ° 
4. OW of an abundance of caution and at the defendants' request, the Court ordered plaintiff deposed in order that the 
underlying nature of his claim was more readily imderstood. As a result, the defendants were fully apprised of the nature of this 
claim. 
III. SHERMAN ACT ALLEGATIONS 
The Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., was enacted in 1890 to prohibit combinations and 
conspiracies in restraint of trade (Section 1), and to regulate monopolies (Section 2). 
Federal jurisdiction is predicated upon an allegation that the actions of the defendant have 
some nexus or connection with interstate commerce. Before the federal court can acquire 
jurisdiction, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions substantially and adversely 
affect interstate commerce. Failure to satisfy this threshold jurisdictional prerequisite will 
result in the dismissal of the complaint. 
[HN5] The general scope of the Sherman Act encompasses the entire regulatory power 
granted Congress [""9] under the Commerce Clause. Apex Hosiery Company v. Leader, 
310 U.S. 469, 60 S. Ct. 982, 84 L. Ed. 1311 (1940). Although the act includes more than 
simply a restraint on trade motivated by a desire to limit interstate commerce, federal 
enforcement must turn initially on whether or not the acts alleged in the complaint could
