Their difference was distinct above all in what kind of a=solution they supported in Syria. The uprising in Syria first 
turned to a =ivil war and could well be tending toward a regional conflict. But the Baathist regime was still standing, 
wi=h no indication that it would be going away anytime soon. 
Ankara was nevertheless persisting on a military solution=and continued to advocate creation of "secure zones" that 
could signif= partial occupation of Syria. Washington, on the other hand, had never warmed to the idea of a military 
intervention= especially one that it would have to lead and had good reasons to avoid. =he latest move was 
Washington's giving priority to a political/diplomati= solution anchored on a joint understanding reached between US 
Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpa=t, Sergei Lavrov, in their May 7 meeting in Moscow. In 
Washington's appr=ach, assistance and support for the opposition was to facilitate such a so=ution. 
As a subtext, one has to look to Washington and Ankara'= stances against the jihadists. Washington was concerned for 
the future of=Syria and its own security from Ankara's opening of Turkish territory to jihadist elements led by the pro-al-
Qaeda =abhat al-Nusra, and was making this known to Ankara. 
The second main divergence was Ankara's insistence on A=sad's departure as a precondition to initiating any diplomatic-
political=solution process. 
But Assad is not going anywhere. To insist on his exit as=a precondition to a political solution was possibly impeding 
peace by ruli=g out an agreed solution that could end up with Assad eventually leaving the stage. That, of course, meant 
eve= more destruction and misery for Syria in the meantime. 
We know that the US, too, favors a transition government =ithout Assad. But we don't think that the Obama 
administration was insis=ing on keeping Assad out of the negotiations aimed at establishing such a transition 
government. How the two parties wo=ld affect each other's stances was a matter of speculation before the Wh=te 
House meeting. 
Whose position was more realistic, more resilient and the=efore more persuasive given the realities? Whose was 
obsolete and had lost=its credibility? 
These questions have to be answered before evaluating the=messages that could well show the way for the near future 
that both leader= gave in their Rose Garden news conference under drizzling rain on May 16.<=p> 
Everybody knows there is no good solution for Syria. The =ost appropriate approach would be to choose the least bad 
option, and end =he bloodbath that is destroying that country and threatening the region with war. 
When that is the criterion, then it becomes impossible to=find anything to defend in Turkey's policy. Erdogan went to 
Washington a= a leader whose military-solution-without-Assad policy had failed. There is more. 
Erdogan sat down at Washington's negotiating table as a l=ader whose misguided Syria policy had endangered his 
country's security =nd stability and accumulated excessive negative energy along fragile sectarian fault lines. 
The bomb that went off on May 11 in Reyhanli town, Hatay =rovince, where hundreds of thousands of Arab Alevis live, 
did not only kil= more than 50 and wound 150. It also rattled Erdogan's position considerably. 
As such, Erdogan went to Washington as a weakened leader =pen to suggestions that it was time to change his Syrian 
policy. 
Now we can assess who said what at the Rose Garden <http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-
video/video/2013/05/16/pres=dent-obama-holds-press-conference-prime-minister-erdogan> and what they meant.
