- The Physics of the Universe" 
Hosted at SpaccX. Caltoch and the Andaz West Hollywood Hyatt. January 8.9.10 2010 
To accomplish the extraordinary. you must seek extruordinaty people. 
James Lee Byars 
In this two day retreat us hope to bring together the lop minds (thinkers and doers) in the fields of the physics of the universe both 
theoretical and experimental. We want to ask and answer questions like "IRw much can us understand about the universe, wont' 
"What is the role of theory and of experiment in getting there?' "Are there things we may not understand?" and "How much of 
what we think we know might be wrong?". The meeting fasten discussion and we arc convinced that when the best people talk the 
outcome is advance and growth. We arc hoping we can avoid standard prepared talks, and focus on exciting forefront issues, where 
dime may be diffrunces of opinion. or new results that will provoke wide discussion. You will receive more information about the 
program and your own possible role in the near future. The summit is inspired by the onset of the Large I ladron Collider. the Planck 
mission the Kcal results by satellite and ground based experiments on dark matter searches, and the vast progress in dimity. Also 
by meetings such as the MC Olympics. and the workshops of the past years at the NIC1P, K111' and Perimeter as well as 
interdisciplinary gatherings of the ASU Origins, the Edge Maga-Classes and Geogle's SciFoo.
