2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82496, * 
c. Plaintiff has not pled his own performance under the contract. 
Finally, Statebridge asserts that p26] Plaintiff has not asserted his own performance of 
the contract. Specifically, plaintiff satisfies his pleading requirements if he alleges (1) a 
contract; (2) a breach of that contract; (3) damages flowing therefrom; and (4) that plaintiff 
performed his own contractual duties. Pub. Serv. Enter. Grp., Inc. v. Philadelphia Elec. 
Ca, 722 F. Supp. 184, 219 (D.N.J. 1989) (citing 5 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and 
Procedure, § 1235 at 189-90). In other words, "when pleading a claim for the breach of an 
express contract . . . the complaint must contain some allegation that the plaintiffs actually 
performed their obligations under the contract." R.H. Damon & Co. v. Softkey Software 
Products, Inc., 811 F. Supp. 986, 991 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (dismissing plaintiffs case for failure 
to do so). 
Here, Statebridge has alleged that "Plaintiff failed to perform his contractual duties under 
the Mortgage," because he "failed to make timely payments pursuant to the Note and 
Mortgage" and is thereby estopped from bringing a breach of contract claim against 
Statebridge under the Mortgage Agreement. (Def.'s Reply at 12) By nature, Defendants 
use force-placed insurance only when a mortgagor has failed to maintain insurance on the 
property at issue, and the Court recognizes that a financially distressed borrower failing to 
make insurance payments may simultaneously fail to make mortgage ["27] payments as 
well. Nonetheless, Plaintiff must show his own performance in order to collect damages 
under the contract itself. Finding that Plaintiff has failed to do so, the Court will dismiss 
Plaintiffs breach of contract claim. 
C. Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing 
Plaintiff has, however, stated a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and 
fair dealing, because he has pleaded that Statebridge deprived him of the benefit of his 
bargain and that Statebridge acted in bad faith." 
11 Plaintiff need not plead his own performance to assert a claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
so long as plaintiff has asserted the existence of a valid contract. See DEJA Distribution Servs.. Inc. v. All Source Freight 
Solutions, Inc.. No. CIV.A. 11-3901 JAP. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEAS 33697. 2012 WI 845929. at '4.5 (D.N.J. Mar. 13. 
2012Xrejecting breach of contract claim for plairtifrs failure to plead its own performance but still reaching implied covenant 
claim (and rejecting it on other wounds)). 
The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which accompanies all contracts under 
New Jersey law, "mandates that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect 
of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract." 
Faistl v. Energy Plus Holdings, LLC, No. CIV.A. 12-2879 JLL, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
125334, 2012 WL 3835815, at *6 (D.N.J. Sept. 4, 2012) (quoting Seidenberg v. Summit 
Bank, 348 N.J.Super. 243, 254, 791 A.2d 1068 (App. Div. 2002)). 
"A party exercising its right p28] to use discretion in setting prices under a contract 
breaches the duty of good faith and fair dealing if that party exercises its discretionary 
authority arbitrarily, unreasonably, or capriciously, with the objective of preventing the 
other party from receiving its reasonably expected fruits under the contract." Wilson v. 
Amerada Hess Corp., 168 N.J. 236, 251, 773 A.2d 1121, 1130 (2001). "Essential to a
