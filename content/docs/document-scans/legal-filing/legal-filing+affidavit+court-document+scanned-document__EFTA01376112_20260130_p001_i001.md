U.S. Shareholder, notwithstanding the fact that generally the character of such gains otherwise would be preserved 
under the PFIC rules if a QEF election were made. 
Also. the PF1C rule permitting the deferral of tax on 
undistributed earnings would not apply. 
A holder of Income Notes that is a U.S. Shareholder of the Issuer subject to the CFC rules for only a 
portion of the time in which it holds its Income Notes should consult its own tax advisors regarding the interaction 
of the PFIC and CFC rules. 
Indirect Interests in Pkit's and CFCs. If the Issuer holds a security of a non-U.S. corporation that is 
treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders of Income Notes could be treated as holding an 
indirect investment in a PFIC or a CFC and could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences. Holders should 
consult their tax advisors regarding the issues relating to such investments. 
Distributions on Income Notes. The treatment of actual cash distributions in respect of the Income Notes. 
in very general terms, will vary depending on whether a U.S. holder has made a timely QEF election as described 
above. If a timely QEF election has been made, dividends (which are distributions up to the amount of current and 
accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer) allocable to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election 
will not be taxable to U.S. holders. Similarly, if the Issuer is a CFC of which the U.S. holder is a U.S. Shareholder. 
dividends will be allocated first to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules and to this extent will not be 
taxable to U.S. holders. Dividends in excess of such previously taxed amounts will be taxable to U.S. holders as 
ordinary income upon receipt. and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction (in the case of corporate 
U.S. holders) or the reduced rates of tax applicable to dividends from certain qualified foreign corporations (in the 
case of individual U.S. holders). Distributions in excess of any current and accumulated earnings and profits will be 
treated first as a nontaxable return of capital, to the extent of the holder's tax basis in the Income Notes. and then as 
capital gain. 
In the event that a U.S. holder does not make a timely QEF election, then except to the extent that 
distributions may be attributable to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules, some or all of any 
dividends distributed with respect to the Income Notes may be considered excess distributions, taxable as previously 
described. 
Sale, Redemption or other Disposition of Income Notes. In general. a U.S. holder of an Income Note will 
recognize gain or loss (which will be capital gain or loss, except as discussed below) upon the sale or exchange of 
such Income Note equal to the difference between the amount realized and such holder's adjusted tax basis in the 
Income Note. A U.S. holder's tax basis in a Income Note will generally equal the amount paid for such Income 
Note. increased by amounts taxable to such holder by virtue of a QEF election. or under the CFC rules, and 
decreased by actual distributions from the Issuer that are deemed to consist of such previously taxed amounts or 
represent a return of capital. 
If a U.S. holder does not make a timely QEF election as described above. any gain realized on the sale or 
exchange of a Income Note will be treated as an excess distribution and effectively taxed as ordinary income under 
the special tax rules described above. 
If the Issuer were treated as a CFC and a U.S. holder were treated as a U.S. Shareholder therein, then any 
gain realized by such holder upon the disposition of its Income Notes. other than gain constituting an excess 
distribution under the PFIC rules, would be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. holder's share of the 
current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer. In this respect. earnings and profits would not include 
any amounts previously taxed pursuant to a timely QEF election or pursuant to the CFC rules. 
The pledge of stock of a PFIC may in some circumstances be treated as a disposition of such stock. 
Tax Treatment of Tax-Exempt U.S. Holders 
In general. a tax-exempt U.S. holder of the Notes will not be subject to tax on unrelated business taxable 
income ("UBTr) with respect to income from the Notes regardless of whether they are treated as equity or debt for
