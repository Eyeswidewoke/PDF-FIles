2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79534, * 
fraud, indicating Jeffrey Prosser never owned the assets. In addition, Prosser argues 
Carroll failed to prove Jeffrey Prosser's insolvency at the time of each transfer, an 
essential element of Carroll's claims, Carroll contends these two issues [*3] have been 
waived because Prosser failed to raise them in a motion for judgment as a matter of law 
prior to submission of all the evidence to the jury. Alternatively, Carroll asserts Prosser's 
arguments fail as a matter of law. 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, which was amended in 2006, permits a court to grant 
judgment as a matter of law "only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the 
nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is 
insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability." Price v. Trans Union, 
L.L. C., No. 09-1332, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36176, at *7, [WL], at *2 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 
16,2012) (quoting LePage's' Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2003)). In 
determining whether to grant this "sparingly invoked remedy," the court must "refrain from 
weighing the evidence, determining the credibility of witnesses, or substituting [itsj own 
version of the facts for that of the jury." Marra v. Phila. Nous. Auth., 497 F.3d 286, 300 (3d 
Cir. 2007) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). A motion for judgment as a 
matter of law may "be made at any time before the case is submitted to the jury." FED R. 
Civ. P. 50(a)(2). raj As long as the motion was raised before the jury received the case, 
the movant may renew the motion within 28 days after entry of judgment. FED. R. CR/. P. 
50(b). However, failure to make a motion for judgment as a matter of law during trial 
'Wholly waives the right to mount any post-trial attack on the sufficiency of the evidence." 
Murphy v. City of Phila. DepY of Recreation, No. 07-4104, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94358, at 
*9, [WL], at *3 n.l (E.D. Pa. Aug. 19, 2011) (citations omitted); see also Jeckell v. 
Crestwood Area Sch. Dist, No. 04-1135, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71380, at *1, [WL), at *2-3 
(M.D. Pa. Sept. 18, 2008). 
Although Prosser made a Rule 50 motion during trial, her argument, as it related to the 
Chapter 7 case, was only that Trustee Carroll did not adduce proof of actual intent by 
Jeffrey Prosser to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors. This is not the same as arguing 
Trustee Carroll failed to prove Jeffrey Prosser owned the assets he transferred to his wife. 
In addition, Prosser asserted an insolvency argument, however this argument related only 
to the solvency of Jeffrey Prosser's company, and not to himself personally. Thus, 
because Prosser did not raise either of the arguments she seeks to raise herein at trial, 
they [* 5] are deemed waived. 
Prosser contends it would he unfair and inequitable to find waiver, as her arguments could 
not have been raised until the jury in the Chapter 11 case delivered its verdict. Prosser 
thus contends this Court should view the Chapter 11 jury verdict as newly discovered 
evidence pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60 (permitting a court to relieve a 
party from a final judgment for, inter alia, "newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable 
diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 
59(b)"). This Court disagrees. 
The verdict in the parallel Chapter 11 case is entirely irrelevant to the issue of whether 
Prosser could have raised the arguments made here before the jury's deliberations. 
Indeed, the Chapter 11 jury's finding was based on evidence submitted prior to that jury's 
deliberations. If, based on the evidence submitted at trial, the Chapter 11 jury could find
