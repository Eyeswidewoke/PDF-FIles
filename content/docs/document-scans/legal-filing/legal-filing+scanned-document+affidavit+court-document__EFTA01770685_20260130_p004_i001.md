Assad regime's assault on its own people. In their ra=ks there is irresolution and endless talk about the complications 
and the =niqueness of the Syrian case. 
No such uncertainty detains the Friends of the Syrian Regime=97Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and to a lesser extent China. In 
this camp, ther= is a will to prevail, a knowledge of the stakes in this cruel contest, and material assistance for the 
Damascus dic=atorship. 
In the face of the barbarism unleashed on the helpless people=of Homs, the Friends of Syria squirm and hope to be 
delivered from any mea=ingful burdens. Still, they are meeting Friday in Tunis to discuss their options. But Syrian 
dictator Bashar al-As=ad needn't worry. The Tunisian hosts themselves proclaimed that this convo=ation held on their 
soil precluded a decision in favor of foreign military=intervention. 
Syria is not Libya, the mantra goes, especially in Washington= The provision of arms to the Syrian opposition is 
"premature," =en. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently stated. We don't know the Syrian 
opposition, another al=bi has it—they are of uncertain provenance and are internally divided. O=r weapons could end 
up in the wrong hands, and besides, we would be "=ilitarizing" this conflict. 
Those speaking in such ways seem to overlook the disparity in=firepower between the Damascus ruler with his tanks 
and artillery, and the=civilian population aided by defectors who had their fill with official terror. 
The borders of Syria offer another exculpation for passivity.=Look at the map, say the naysayers. Syria is bordered by 
Lebanon, Iraq, Jo=dan, Turkey and Israel. Intervention here is certain to become a regional affair. 
Grant the Syrians sympathy, their struggle unfolds in the mid=t of an American presidential contest. And the incumbent 
has his lines at =he ready for his acceptance speech in Charlotte, N.C. He's done what he had promised during his first 
presidenti=l run, shutting down the war in Iraq and ending the American presence. Thi= sure applause line precludes the 
acceptance of a new burden just on the o=her side of the Syria-Iraq frontier. 
The silence of President Obama on the matter of Syria reveals=the general retreat of American power in the Middle 
East. In Istanbul some=days ago, a Turkish intellectual and political writer put the matter starkly to me: We don't think 
and talk muc= about America these days, he said. 
Yet the tortured dissertations on the uniqueness of Syria's s=rategic landscape are in fact proofs for why we must thwart 
the Iran-SyriarHezbollah nexus. Topple the Syrian dictatorship and the access of Iran to the Mediterranean is severed, 
leaving the brigan=s of Hamas and Hezbollah scrambling for a new way. The democracies would d=monstrate that 
regimes of plunder and cruelty, perpetrators of terror, hav= been cut down to size. 
Plainly, the Syrian tyranny's writ has expired. Assad has imp=icated his own Alawite community in a war to defend his 
family's reign. Th= ambiguity that allowed the Assad tyranny to conceal its minority, schismatic identity, to hide behind a 
co-opted Su=ni religious class, has been torn asunder. Calls for a jihad, a holy war, =gainst a godless lot have been made 
in Sunni religious circles everywhere. 
Ironically, it was the Assad tyranny itself that had summoned=those furies in its campaign against the American war in 
Iraq. It had prov=ded transit and sanctuary for jihadists who crossed into Iraq to do battle against the Americans and the 
Shiites; =t even released its own Islamist prisoners and dispatched them to Iraq wit= the promise of pardon. Now the 
chickens have come home to roost, and an A=awite community beyond the bounds of Islam is facing a religious war in 
all but name. 
This schism cannot be viewed with American indifference. It i= an inescapable fate that the U.S. is the provider of order 
in that region= We can lend a hand to the embattled Syrians or risk turning Syria into a devil's playground of religious 
extre=ism. Syria can become that self-fulfilling prophesy: a population abandone= by the powers but offered false solace 
and the promise of redemption by t=e forces of extremism and ruin.
