Iranian police chief at the time,10 Esmail Alunadi-Moghaddam, explained during an interview 
that 130,000 more people were becoming addicts each year." Because of this situation, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran has had to wage a real 'War on Drugs'. And the said `war' should 
not be seen as a mere catch-phrase here: more than 3,700 security officers were killed during 
clashes with smugglers,12 and walls were built at the Afghan-Iranian border as shootouts 
have been happening regularly in this area. The Iranians have spent at least US$600 million a 
year to deal with this threat. Ten per cent of its conscripts are mobilised to secure the border 
with this problematic neighbour.13 Seen from a comfortable distance, the anti-drugs laws and 
actions of Tehran can look severe (death penalty for trade or possession of more than five kg 
of opium or 30g of heroin, for example).14 But, with the numbers of addicts being so big, 
with the social and economic consequences of trafficking being real, and with the source of 
the problem (Afghanistan) being so close, Tehran's 'repressive' approach is somewhat 
understandable. However, Tehran can truly deal with this issue only if Afghanistan itself is 
stabilised by the establishment of a viable state — integrated again with the international 
community, and being strong enough to fight drug trafficking in collaboration with its 
neighbours. The situation is already slightly better in the post-Taliban period, of course. 
Afghanistan is not a totally `failed' or `rogue' state any more, and there has been better 
cooperation in the fight against trafficking between Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. An 
example of this relative improvement is the cooperation resulting in simultaneous operations 
in 2009 and 2010. Seventy-four drug dealers and a few tons of hashish, opium and heroin 
were seized. I
But all this does not change the fact that Iran's pre-9/11 problem, traceable to drugs from 
Afghanistan, is still an important concern for Teheran today. As long as the Afghan territory 
is not truly stabilised under the control of one internationally recognised authority, these anti-
drug-menace victories will be of little consequence, even in the short term. The Afghan areas 
that are not under the control of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) forces produce 
the bulk of the poppy farm yields. And the Taliban has profited from this situation, to say the 
least, collecting at least US$125 million a year in opium production in 2009, at a time when 
I° Still, with the same responsibilities, as of May 2012.
