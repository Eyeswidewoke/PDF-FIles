Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Following this offering, we intend to utilize these exemptions. As a result, we will not have a majority of independent directors nor 
will our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you 
will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance 
requirements. 
In the event that we cease to be a controlled company within the meaning of these rules, we will be required to comply with these 
provisions after specified transition periods. 
More specifically, if we cease to be a controlled company within the meaning of these rules, we will be required to (i) satisfy the 
majority independent board requirement within one year of our status change, and (ii) have (a) at least one independent member on 
each of our nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee by the date of our status change, (b) at least 
a majority of independent members on each committee within 90 days of the date of our status change and (c) fully independent 
committees within one year of the date of our status change. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our board of directors does not have a formal policy on whether the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board of 
directors should be separate. However, Robert G. Miller currently serves as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Our board of 
directors has considered its leadership structure and believes at this time that our company and its stockholders are best served by 
having one person serve in both positions. Combining the roles fosters accountability, effective decision-making and alignment between 
interests of our board of directors and management. Mr. Miller also is able to use the in-depth focus and perspective gained in his 
executive function to assist our board of directors in addressing both internal and external issues affecting the company. 
Our corporate governance guidelines provide for the election of one of our non-management directors to serve as Lead Director 
when the Chairman of the board of directors is also the Chief Executive Officer. Lenard B. Tessler currently serves as our Lead Director. 
and is responsible for serving as a liaison between the Chairman and the non-management directors, approving meeting agendas and 
schedules for our board and presiding at executive sessions of the non-management directors and any other board meetings at which 
the Chairman is not present, among other responsibilities. 
Our board of directors expects to periodically review its leadership structure to ensure that it continues to meet the company's 
needs. 
Role of Board in Risk Oversight 
While the full board of directors has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, its committees oversee 
risk in certain specified areas. In particular, our audit and risk committee oversees management of enterprise risks as well as financial 
risks. Our compensation committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our executive compensation plans 
and arrangements and the incentives created by the compensation awards it administers. Our compliance committee is responsible for 
overseeing the management of compliance and regulatory risks facing our company and risks associated with business conduct and 
ethics. Our nominating and corporate governance committee oversees risks associated with corporate governance. Pursuant to our 
board of directors' instruction, management regularly reports on applicable risks to the relevant committee or the full board of directors, 
as appropriate, with additional review or reporting on risks conducted as needed or as requested by our board of directors and its 
committees.
