Table of Contain 
Global Business Solutions 
Our OBS segment revenues are primarily derived from processing credit and debit card transactions for business clients and also include 
fees for providing processing, loyalty and software services and sales and leases of POS devices. Revenues are generated from a variety of sources: 
• 
Discount fees charged to a merchant, net of credit and debit card interchange and assessment fees charged by the payment networks. The 
discount fee is typically either a percentage of the purchase amount or an interchange fee plus a fixed dollar amount: 
• 
Processing fees charged to our alliances: 
• 
Processing fees charged to merchant acquirers who have outsourced their transaction processing to us; 
Sales and leases of POS devices: 
Fees from providing reporting and other services: and 
• 
Software and software-as-a-service fees generated from the Clover App Starker. 
GBS revenue is presented net of interchange feu and assessments but includes reimburseable debit network firs and other, which is 
also included as an expense. 
A substantial portion of our business within the GI3S segment is conducted through merchant alliances between the Company and 
financial institutions. If we have majority ownership and management control over an alliance, then the alliance's financial statements are 
consolidated with ours and the related processing fees are treated as an intercompany transaction and eliminated upon consolidation. If we do not 
have a controlling ownership interest in an alliance, we use the equity method of accounting to account for our investment in the alliance. As a 
result, our consolidated revenues include certain processing fees charged to alliances accounted for under the equity method. 
A large portion of segment revenue is derived from transaction and processing related services. This business is dependent on 
macroeconomic consumer trends and global economic conditions that affect the volume of consumer spending and the use of electronic payments 
and changes in these factors have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, our ability to grow this portion of the business. We have 
begun to implement recent initiatives, such as the introduction of several new products and expansion of our sales force. in an effort to grow this 
business versus prior periods.
