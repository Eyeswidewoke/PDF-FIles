I would ask that you realize that very =A0unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal a=tention and 
my personal time . Time that I was forced to=C2 grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you a=e my 
very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding =rocess that I have decided i will have this year for my time 
.=C2 (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask tha= you keep in mind that though our deal expired 
months ago. (also kee=ing in mind , that your understanding of the final payment terms nei=her reflected the emails or 
my memory, we finished it up your way. ) =A0I have answered every call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, ha=e made . 
reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was =orced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dang=rous not to. 
I made serious dollar and time concessions last year.ve=y serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your 
conce=ns , but I am, under no circumstances , none, willing to=spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up 
Carlyn's mess = which was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were =oth highly aware of the dire circumstances in 
which you found yourself las= year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness. and those v=ry circumstances I 
took extra care in our negotiations . (you had clrimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with m= very 
close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious =C2 ,in the near future, another barrel will appear of your 
own design =AO ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had alr=ady been paid for the work that is now required. The art partnership 
has f=lly answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligatio=s and more so. . <=span>( FYI Carlyns art 
=artnership that you referenced is similar in only its ti=le. ) You will al=o recall that you required that my payments be 
at the end of my work=not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was never to =nclude hours upon hours of 
training your staff). I eventually agreed= this of course should make clear that the 2=14 tax year that will close Oct 
2015 is not covered by our past agre=ment at all. I pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed=a multi 
year agreement right out of the box. you said you preferred =ot. As you said ,I have produced results to date, =AO far in 
excess of even my own exalted opinion of my projections. I have =evoted a monumental amount of my limited amount 
of time-- way, way i= excess of our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to rol= in the amount still outstanding from 
last year if that helps .. How=ver, As my best student , and my only one, you are now=C2 capable of doing most, if not 
all, of the required work =ourself. I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just =ave fun, trade 
stories,. share moments ideas etc.. I am of c=urse always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that ro=te . 
always . It will take a great deal of your time , b=t you will not have to spend any more money on mine . <=div> We 
are scheduled t= meet fri at 430 , I leave at S am sat morning.<=r style="font-size:12.8000001907349pC>
