I am very pleased with the results, and I am confident we are on the right track. Everybody will recognise shortly 
the encouraging indicators of the economic recovery. 
PAUL STORER, Gulf News 
If it became necessary, what further steps of support would the government consider for the 
financial services and property industries? Would the government consider extending 
support to other important industries in the UAE, like tourism? If so, what form might this 
take? 
The measures we have undertaken so far have shifted the UAE economy from the crisis mood to the solution 
mood. Not one country in the world, regardless of what efficient systems it boasts, could have ensured recovery 
from the financial crisis before recognising its actual impact on the global economy and international markets. No 
one could predict ensuring recovery before the world's leading economies consolidates their efforts to face the 
crisis. That actually took several months of constant work. Now, optimistic voices are getting louder worldwide, 
while markets' fear has started to gradually diminish. 
The UAE has one of the region's most progressive, vibrant and open economies. Efforts by world leading 
economies to deal with the financial crisis have been effective and fruitful, while the tendency to increase 
international cooperation — including recent decisions by the G20 summit in London — remains very positive and 
encouraging. I can confidently say that the UA E is very well positioned on the recovery path, thanks to our 
domestic policy measures — such as the fiscal stimulus, easing monetary policy, and increasing liquidity in the 
system. There are some early indicators of international economic recovery. Yet, I cannot predict that the global 
economic recovery will proceed without potential hurdles. I cannot also claim that repercussions of the economic 
financial meltdown are over yet. But what I can say is that the worst is already behind us, and there is now a solid 
will and determination among concerned countries to join hands to collectively revive the global economy as well 
as their own individual economies. 
Increasing financial support to other business sectors is probable, pending the actual needs of each particular 
sector. The UAE's tourism sector is in a good shape, with UAE hotels recording high occupancy rates. The 
country's tourism industry has already successful survived the worst period and resiliently adapted itself during 
the most critical times.

What are the main strengths and weaknesses of the UAE, as it faces the challenge of the 
global economic slowdown? What are the particular challenges that Dubai faces as it 
positions itself as a global business centre? 
The UAE's strengths are numerous. The UAE's success in facing the global financial crisis and alleviating its 
impact on the Emirati economy is the most conspicuous=2 Oevidence of these strengths. The country enjoys a 
leading ranking position in several fields such as productivity, environment, connectivity, and transformation to 
knowledge economy. Yet the failure to match best international practices in these fields might be considered a 
major weakness. We always benchmark ourselves against the best. I always say that we have just embarked on a 
long journey of hard work to fulfil our promised sustainable development through a series of strategic projects to 
be established during the years to come.
