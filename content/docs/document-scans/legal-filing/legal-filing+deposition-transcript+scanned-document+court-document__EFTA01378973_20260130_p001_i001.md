Subject to Early Redemption, if a Coupon Barrier Event does not occur, we will pay a contingent coupon 
expected to be at least $30 (to be determined on the Trade Date) per $1,000 principal amount of securities on 
the immediately following Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If a Coupon Barrier Event has occurred, no 
contingent coupon will be paid on the immediately following Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If any 
Contingent Coupon Payment Date is not a business day, the contingent coupon will be payable on the first 
following business day, unless that business day falls in the next calendar month, in which case payment will be 
made on the first preceding business day. The amount of any contingent coupon will not be adjusted in respect 
of any postponement of a Contingent Coupon Payment Date and no interest or other payment will be payable 
hereon because of any such postponement of a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. No contingent coupons will 
be payable following an Early Redemption. Contingent coupons, if any, will be payable on the applicable 
Contingent Coupon Payment Date to the holder of record at the close of business on the business day 
immediately preceding the applicable Contingent Coupon Payment Date; provided that the contingent coupon 
payable on the Early Redemption Date or Maturity Date, as applicable, will be payable to the person to whom 
the Early Redemption Amount or the Redemption Amount, as applicable, is payable. 
A Coupon Barrier Event will occur if, on any trading day during an Observation Period, the closing level of any 
Underlying is less than its Coupon Barrier Level. 
Each Observation Period will be from but excluding an Observation Date to and including the next following 
Observation Date, provided that the first Observation Period will be from and excluding the Trade Date to and 
including the first Observation Date. 
Subject to Early Redemption, at maturity, the Redemption Amount you will receive will depend on the individual 
performance of each Underlying and whether a Knock-In Event has occurred. For each $1,000 principal amount 
of securities, the Redemption Amount will be determined as follows: 
• 
If a Knock-In Event has not occurred, $1,000. Therefore, you will not participate in any appreciation of 
any Underlying. 
• 
If a Knock-In Event has occurred, 51,000 multiplied by the sum of one plus the Underlying Return of the 
Lowest Performing Underlying. In this case, the Redemption Amount will be less than $750 per $1,000 
principal amount of securities. You could lose your entire investment. 
Any payment on the securities is subject to our ability to pay our obligations as they become due. 
The Issuer may redeem the securities in whole, but not in part, on any Contingent Coupon Payment Date 
scheduled to occur on or after January 22, 2019 but prior to the Maturity Date, upon notice to the trustee on or 
before the immediately preceding Observation Date for $1,000 for each $1,000 principal amount of the 
securities (the "Early Redemption Amount"), together with the contingent coupon, if any, payable on that 
Contingent Coupon Payment Date (the "Early Redemption Date"). No further payments will be made in respect 
of the securities. Payment will be made in respect of the Early Redemption on the Contingent Coupon Payment 
Date immediately following the relevant Observation Date. Any payment on the securities is subject to our 
ability to pay our obligations as they become due. 
A Knock-In Event will occur if the Final Level of any Underlying is less than its Knock-In Level.
