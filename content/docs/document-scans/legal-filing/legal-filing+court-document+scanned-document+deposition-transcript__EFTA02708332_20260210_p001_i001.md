Company Background: 
Real Time Investments has been operating in the US residential housing market since 2008, buying, 
refurbishing and tenanting/managing single family homes. The company has been selling these 
homes to clients investing between $60,000- 300,000. $60,000 is our approximate average sale price 
for a single unit. All of the properties on our books are fully owned by the company and are tenanted 
prior to sale to investors. This gives us an added assurance in detailing projected rental yields to our 
clients. 
Our target rental yield per property is currently 14% per annum. The demand for rental properties in 
the areas we operate in has given us the capacity to back our clients' investments under Escrow to 
provide a 12% net rental yield for the first 2 years of ownership. Gains of 12.1% in US house prices 
(Case-Shiller) in April (year-on-year) have also made this a good capital appreciation prospect in the 
longer-term, given prices are still far from their pre-crisis peaks. 
There are four core departments of the business: property research and acquisition; property 
refurbishment; property management; sales & client relations. 
(1) Research and Acquisition: we focus on markets that meet three general criteria- rental 
yields are high, rental demand is high and there are prospects for capital appreciation. Our 
focus is currently on the Suburbs outside of Detroit where we have selected a number of 
neighbourhoods that realise these investment objectives. To read more about these specific 
areas refer to our attached 2013 'Michigan Portfolio' brochure. 
In addition to regular trips to Michigan by our Managing Directors, boots on the ground are 
important. We have an infrastructure of personnel in Metro Detroit sourcing units from 
banks (foreclosures) and private landlords. It it is important to pinpoint target areas on a 
street-by-street basis, which is why we never buy a package of properties without having 
done the necessary due diligence on each individual unit. A desirable residential location and 
projected refurbishment costs are two imperative elements considered in every acquisition. 
This process is ongoing, so we typically monitor between 30-40 properties at any one time. 
Currently we are unable to take full advantage of this level of high quality stock and see 
potential to significantly ramp up our acquisition. 
(2) Property Refurbishment: again, we do not deal with third parties. Our construction team 
does the work for each of the properties we have refurbished. Apart from pushing down 
costs, this provides a procedural consistency, meaning we can be confident that our 
properties are liveable and durable when tenants move in. 
The level of refurbishment we implement varies from property to property- our 
refurbishment team is capable of comprehensive construction work as well as small-scale 
touch-ups. 
(3) Property Management: our partnership with Peerless Properties in Detroit provides us with 
a professional residential management team with online services to track rental income. 
Regular property inspections and tenant assessments have led to Peerless delivering an 
outstanding rental consistency within our portfolio and those of our clients. Initial rental 
contracts are set in place for a 12month period, after which we negotiate a contract
