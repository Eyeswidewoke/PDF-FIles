FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
differently. Our view that USD strength will broaden 
out to GI0 low-yielders like EUR, and continue to gain 
ground against the JPY is thus an important tailwind 
for USD/SGD. SGD is also one of the most overvalued 
currencies globally, with consensus across a broad 
range of models. Moreover, domestic vulnerabilities 
have built up in Singapore over the OE years from high 
household debt to bubbly property prices that leave her 
exposed to inevitable short-end rates normalization. 
We are long USD/SGD looking for a move above 1.30 
this year.

We expect RMB appreciation to persist in 2014 despite 
a strong USD environment. With global growth 
gradually recovering and Asian exports likely to catch 
up, we look for a healthy current account surplus for 
China ($220bn, 2.2% GDP). In addition, expectations of 
further increases in offshore investment quotas (i.e. 
RQFII) on the back of capital account liberalization, 
should mean that portfolio inflows pick up, putting 
further appreciation pressure on RMB. With the 
appreciation trend intact, and carry potentially set to 
become more attractive as authorities push forward 
with interest rate liberalization; we are likely to see 
speculative flows into China persist. Inflation will be a 
key driver of the pace at which this appreciation is 
permitted by the authorities. The main risk to our view 
is from the sizeable nature of short USD positioning in 
this pair - both in the offshore and onshore markets. In 
the event of weaker economic data driven by tight 
monetary conditions and reforms, we could see a 
pickup in volatility. For now though, we stay short 12M 
USD/CNH with a target of 5.95. 
JPY/KRW heading back to single-digits 
The won's fate in 2014 remains a struggle between 
strong underlying fundamentals, and the defensiveness 
of the central bank in the face of concerns about a 
weakening yen. The fundamental story is supported by 
1) continuing improvement in the current account; 2) 
high leverage to the global growth/trade upturn; and 3) 
strength of the domestic financial system as a result of 
the macro prudential policies implemented post-2008. 
Given the strength in export orders in construction and 
shipping and the resulting hedging pressure, as well as 
the record levels of USD deposits held by Korean 
corporates, there is likely to be persistent pressure on 
the currency to appreciate. BoK on the other hand is 
unlikely to abandon its conservative stance on the won, 
given concerns about upside to exports being 
competed away by a cheapening yen. We have seen 
such concerns drive the policy response function in 
2009. in mid-2012 and again last year. Given the 
expected strength in the broader dollar, and the Bors 
reaction function, we see better risk reward to express 
the view of fundamental strength in KRW via JPY/KRW 
downside. We target a clean break of the psychological 
10 level, with a near-term target of 9.75.
