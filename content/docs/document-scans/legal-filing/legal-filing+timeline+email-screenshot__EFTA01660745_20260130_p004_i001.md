IN THE NEWS 
Judge Delays Trump's Hush Money Sentencing Until at Least September After High 
Court Immunity Ruling 
The Associated Press (07/02, Offenhartz, Peitz) and Reuters (07/02, Cohen, Heavey) reported that in a 
major reprieve for former President Donald Trump, sentencing for his hush money convictions was 
postponed until at least September as the judge agreed to weigh the impact of a new Supreme Court 
ruling on presidential immunity. According to the articles, Trump had been scheduled to face sentencing 
on July 11, but the postponement sets the sentencing for Sept. 18 at the earliest. Trump's lawyers are 
arguing that the Supreme Court ruling merits not only delaying the sentencing but also tossing out his 
conviction. The articles explained that the Supreme Court decision granted broad immunity protections 
to presidents, making it harder for prosecutors to use evidence of official acts in criminal cases. This ruling 
restricts prosecutors from citing presidential duties as evidence when trying to prove that unofficial 
actions violated the law. The articles noted that prosecutors with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin 
Bragg's office said Trump's argument was "without merit," but agreed to delay the sentencing to give 
Trump the chance to make his case. A timeline posted by ABC News (07/02, Katersky, Charalambous) 
illustrated the FBI's involvement in the Hush Money case. The article reported that on April 9, 2018, the 
FBI executed a search warrant on Michael Cohen's residence and office. Prosecutors alleged that Trump 
and others engaged in a pressure campaign to ensure Cohen did not cooperate with law enforcement. 
The article noted that Cohen later pled guilty, admitting his role in the hush money payments and stating 
that he acted at Trump's direction. Additional reporting on the story was provided by the New York Times

Indigenous Activist Denied Parole for 1975 Killings of Two FBI Agents Serving 
Warrants 
The Associated Press (07/02, Hollingsworth) reported that Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier has been 
denied parole for the 1975 killings of two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South 
Dakota. According to the article, the U.S. Parole Commission announced that he won't be eligible for 
another hearing until June 2026. His attorney, Kevin Sharp, criticized the decision, stating, "This decision 
is a missed opportunity for the United States to finally recognize the misconduct of the FBI and send a 
message to Indian Country regarding the impacts of the federal government's actions and policies of the 
1970s." The FBI and its former agents dispute Peltier's claims of innocence, with Mike Clark, president of 
the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, stating, "They were down, they were wounded, they 
were helpless and he shot them point blank. It is a heinous crime." The family of one of the agents, Jack 
Coler, also opposes Peltier's release, with Coler's son writing, "Peltier allows himself to be celebrated 
thus. He knows his guilt." The article noted that Director Wray said in a statement that "justice continues 
to prevail." And Natalie Bara, president of the FBI Agents Association, described Peltier in a statement as 
an "unremorseful murderer." Additional reporting on the story was provided by Reuters (07/02, Clifford),
