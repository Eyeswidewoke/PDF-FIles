A weakening in the economy could also force some retailers to clog", resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and declines in 
transactions, and reduced earnings on transactions due to a potential shift to large discount merchants. Additionally, credit card issuers may reduce 
credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices. Changes in economic conditions could adversely impact our future 
revenues and profits and result in a downgrade of our debt ratings. which may lead to termination or modification of certain contracts and make it 
more difficult for us to obtain new business. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of 
operations. 
Our ability to anticipate and respond to changing industry trends and the needs and preferences of our clients and consumers may ig[ett our 
competitiveness or demand for our products, which may adversely affect our operating results. 
Financial services. payments. and technology industries are subject to rapid technological advancements. new products and services, 
including mobile payment applications, evolving competitive landscape. developing industry standards, and changing client and consumer needs 
and preferences. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the financial grnices, payments, and technology industries will 
continue to emerge. Thew changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Also. our clients and their 
customers continue to adopt new technology for business and personal uses. We must anticipate and respond to these changes in order to remain 
competitive within our relative markets. For example, our ability to provide innovative point-of-sale technology to our merchant clients could have 
an impact on our Global Business Solutions business. In addition, failure to develop value-added services that meet the needs and preferences of 
our clients could have an adverse effect on ow ability to compete effectively in our industry•. Furthermore. clients' and their customers' potential 
negative reaction to our products and services can spread quickly through social media and damage our reputation before we have the opportunity 
to nvond. If we are unable to anticipate or respond to technological changes or evolving industry• standards on a timely basis, our ability to remain 
competitive could be materially adversely affected. 
Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the financial services, payments, and technology industries mar materially and 
adversely affect our overall business and operations. 
Financial services, payments, and technology industries are highly competitive and our payment solutions compete against all forms of 
financial services and payment systems. including cash and checks, and eltxtronic, mobile, and eCommerce payment platforms. if we are unable to 
differentiate ourselves from our competitors. drive value for our clients and/or effectively align ow resources with our goals and objectives, we 
may not be able to compete effectively. Our competitors may introduce their own value-added or other services or solutions more effectively than 
we do, which could adversely impact our growth. We also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment system. 
°Commerce payment systems. and payment systems for mobile devices. Failure to compete effectively against any of these competitive threats 
could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the highly competitive nature of our industry could lead to increased pricing pressure which 
could have a material impact on our overall business and results of operations. 
Potential changes in the competitive landscape, including disintermediation from other participants in the payments value chain, could harm 
our business. 
We expect that the competitive landscape will continue to change. including: 
• 
Rapid and significant changes in technology, resulting in new and innovative payment methods and programs that could place us at a 
competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our products. 
• 
Competitors, clients. governments, and other industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace our value-added 
products and services.
