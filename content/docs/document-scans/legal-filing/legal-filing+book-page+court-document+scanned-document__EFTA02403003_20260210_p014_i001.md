Hence we encounter a new situation in realizing the relativity of inertial frames in a non-
commutative spacetime, which is that a feature of special relativity fails to hold here. In special 
relativity the synchronization of clocks can be extended arbitrarily far from the clock which an-
chors the procedure. This of course breaks down when there is curvature. Here we see the process 
by which an inertial observer assigns coordinates to distant events is breaking down even in the 
absence of the gravitational field. This is due either to effects of the non-commutativity of space-
time (or, equivalently, the curvature of momentum space), or to an energy dependence of the 
speed of light. This should not be surprising, to the contrary it would have been strange if the 
principle of the relativity of inertial frames can be extended to the non-commutative case without 
loosing some feature of the physics. Giving up the presumption that the procedure of clock syn-
chronization can be carried out to cosmological distances is not a lot to give up. Indeed, in the real 
world, the procedure breaks down for curvature effects long before the issues discussed here are 
encountered. 
This is then a situation like curvature, or the obstructions in the construction of coordinate 
patches in complex manifolds, in which a procedure for assigning meaningful coordinates breaks 
down globally. This raises the question of whether there is an elegant global description as we do 
find in curved geometries and complex manifolds, perhaps inherent in the mathematical structure 
of the ic-Poincare algebra[25]. If so, this may affect other open problems such as the meaning 
of velocity of distant particles in ,c-Minkowski spacetime[14, 15], the problem of unitarity[16), 
as well as the issue of constructing sensible interacting quantum field theories in tc-Minkowski 
spa cetimekappafields. 
These remain crucial issues for further work.

A Relationship to other approaches 
In this appendix I would like to contrast the results we have found to hold for tc-Minkowski 
spacetime with those found for other approaches. 
First, there is an analysis of a different formulation of DSR, based directly on deforming the 
action of the generators of the Poincare algebra[22], which obtains results similar to those found 
here: There is no macroscopic non-locality in the detection events, seen by an observer near the 
detector, but there are issues of coordinate ambiguities for the emission event. 
On the other hand, [6] finds that Bob's satellite frame sees macroscopic non-locality at the 
detector. It is important to understand the reason for this disagreement. We first look at the
