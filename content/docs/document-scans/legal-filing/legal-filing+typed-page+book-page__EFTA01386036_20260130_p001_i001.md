Special Report: Argentina • Position for the upturn 
dated forward rates as shown below. The first is simply 
to concatenate the short end LEBACs and longer end 
BOTEs. The second is to fit a spline curve first as a 
parametric representation of the two curves, then 
adjust it (effectively shifting up the BOTEs) so that the 
overlapping data points (at March 2018 tenor) between 
the two curve match. These are inputs to price the 
floaters.

BOPOM 20s have been a popular choice in positioning 
for carry, but BOCANs look superior for those that 
tolerate lower liquidity. In particular, we believe, 
BOCANs could benefit from a tightening spread 
between LEBAC yields and BADLAR. We expect 
higher-for-longer LEBAC rates to attract a larger share 
of savings while a growing economy will demand more 
credit from banks. Altogether these two should 
translate into higher demand and lower supply of funds, 
which means higher BADLAR rates vs. LEBACs.

LEBAC yields have moved first on the tightening of 
monetary policy, which has driven up the basis 
Page 4 
between 1M LEBAC rate and BADLAR to a recent peak 
of 600bp (chart) before it started to recede. Despite 
convergence during the past month, the current basis 
(close to 500bp) remain significantly higher than 
historical average and we see it likely further converge 
to 400bp area in the coming months. This dynamics 
should help boost the relative value of the BOCANs vs. 
BOTEs - and also vs. BOPOM 20s. 
As we delineate in our previous report Argentina Local 
Markets - The Way of the Bullish (Part la we assess 
relative valuation of BOCANs vs BOTEs via projecting 
BADLAR rates using forward rates implied by a 
nominal curve derived from LEBACs and BONTEs. We 
then reset the coupons for the BOCANs, calculate the 
"Fixed rate implied yield" for the BOCANs and contrast 
it with the yield of comparable fixed rate bonds. 
In this piece, we use two scenarios for forward rates as 
shown in the chart on the left. While the LEBACs 
provide a better reference for policy in the longer end 
the BOTEs are the anchor for the projected floating 
rates in the long-end. Instead of combining these 
segmented curves we use the two as lower and upper 
boundaries for valuation of BOCANs and BOPOMs 20s. 
The chart below shows the results.

In sum, focusing on the short end of the curve, 
• 
The 18s and 19s look a good (accessible) 
alternative to LEBACS. 
• 
Going a bit longer, BOCAN 20s look more attractive 
(by up to 200bp) vs. BOPOM 20s and also vs. 
BOTEs.
