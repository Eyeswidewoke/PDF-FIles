Fund Terms and Conditions 
All requests to modify or appoint additional advisors and 
successor advisors to a fund must be communicated to 
the community foundation in writing. In addition, a written 
acknowledgement must be received from the community 
foundation confirming that the request has been granted. 
If the community foundation has not received the name(s) 
of an additional advisor(s) or successor advisor(s) to the 
fund, or other special instructions, in writing, the community 
foundation will use the fund's balance to support the 
community foundation's Community Endowment Fund. 
The following Fund Advisory Privileges and Fund Relationship 
Definitions further explain the role of advisors and other 
interested parties to funds at the community foundation. 
These terms correlate to the Fund Agreement forms and will 
determine the fund's contacts and advisors. 
Fund Relationship and Fund Advisory Privileges 
Definitions: 
Primary Contact: One person per fund who should be 
contacted first for anything concerning the fund. This 
individual may or may not have fund advisory privileges. 
Fund Advisor: Individual has full advisory privileges over 
a fund, including grant recommendations, investment 
recommendations, naming the fund and appointment of other 
fund advisors and successor advisors. (This is the highest 
level of authority.) 
Secondary Advisor: Individual also has full advisory 
privileges over grant recommendations but has no other fund 
administration advisory privileges. (This is an intermediate 
level of authority.) 
Fund Representative: Individual has access to fund 
information but no fund advisory privileges. (This is the 
lowest level of authority.) 
Successor Advisor: The second generation fund advisor; 
he or she has no advisory privileges until the cessation to act 
of all initial fund advisors. (Primarily for donor advised funds, 
committee advised funds and scholarship funds.) 
Fund Spending Policy 
The community foundation recommends a minimum 5% 
annual distribution rate for all funds. For endowed funds, 
the community foundation's board of directors sets and 
monitors a required annual distribution rate that is calculated 
as a percentage of fund assets. This rate is based on 12 
trailing quarter balances and is subject to change based 
on community needs, investment performance and the 
long-term preservation of endowment funds' principal. An 
endowed fund must be invested for a minimum of 12 
months before the fund's initial annual distribution rate 
can be calculated. 
Grant Disbursement 
Grants must be for charitable purposes, and those grants 
may be recommended to any 501(c)(3) organization or 
verified charitable entity (e.g. schools, religious institutions) 
located in the United States or any nongovernmental 
organization outside of the United States having a verifiable 
charitable purpose. All grants directed outside of the United 
States must comply with federal government regulations, and 
the prospective grantee must be verified as the equivalent 
of a public benefit organization within the United States and 
must otherwise conform to all relevant U.S. federal and state 
laws. Grants may also be given for charitable purposes to 
non-501(c)(3) organizations if the charitable expenditure 
can be verified through a process called expenditure 
responsibility. Expenditure responsibility is required for 
any organization not described in IRS Section 170(b)(1)(A), 
including for-profit companies, private operating foundations 
and new public charities that do not yet have 501(c)(3) status 
and disqualifying supporting organizations. 
Grants given to all 501(c)(3) public charities within the United 
States must be for a minimum of $200. Grants given outside 
the United States or requiring expenditure responsibility 
within the United States must be for a minimum of $1,000. 
Grant checks sent to organizations are accompanied by 
a community foundation letter specifying the name of the 
fund and the fund advisor's name(s) unless requested 
otherwise by the donor or fund advisor and as approved 
by the community foundation. The fund advisor's address 
may also be included on all letters if requested by the fund 
advisor. Mail which the community foundation receives for 
the fund will not be forwarded. Approved grants are typically 
sent within 10 working days of the recommendation being 
received or the fund advisor will be notified as to the reason 
for a delay. However, any fund submitting 20 or more grant 
recommendations at one time should allow up to two weeks 
for processing. Grants made from funds at the community 
foundation are issued on checks with the name and logo of 
the community foundation.
