It is also interesting to note that in the ,c-Poincare context translations can also split the non-
commuting time coordinate, t, of an event. The formula for an infinitesimal translation in 
Poincare is[23, 24] 
bt = a° — tppiaie'PP°; 
oxi = ai
(22) 
for infinitesimal translations labeled by a four vector, (a°, ai). Thus, consider an event at t = 0, 
x' = 0 in some frame, defined by the collision of two particles with momentum, pt and A. If we 
consider this event with respect to another frame at rest with respect to the first, but translated a 
distance a in the I direction, the event will be split into two events with a time difference 
At' = tpa(pr —74) +0(t?,) 
(23) 
So also we have to ask if what we have here is a case of one event that somehow has become 
two, or simply a single event whose time coordinate in a distant frame is ambiguous. I would 
claim that for both for boosts and translations, these coordinate ambiguities are just a new kind 
of coordinate artifact. To support this I would note that these coordinate ambiguities have very 
peculiar properties for real physical effects. 
• The alleged problem with locality always occurs at very large distances from the point 
around which boosts are made, ie the origin of the coordinate system that defines an inertial 
frame. 
• The presence or absence of this distant non-locality appears to depend on the position and 
motion of the observer. What happens is that an event which is local in one reference frame, 
appears to become two events, when described with the coordinates of a frame of reference 
which is moving with respect to the first and/or very distant from it. 
• When a single event is split by such a distant lorentz boost into two, they are time like 
separated, and which is to the future and which past depends on the direction of the velocity 
of the moving frame. 
• When the event is split by a translation, the causal order of the two events that are apparently 
created depend on whether the translations was done to the left or to the right. When the 
event is split by the use of a commuting time coordinate, 2', the causal order depends on the 
direction of the momenta of the photons. 
I would then propose that the correct interpretation of these results is that the apparent split, 
in which the time coordinate of a single distant event is given two or more different values, is not 
a physical phenomena at all, but only a coordinate ambiguity, which occurs when one attempts 
to define a moving inertial frame by synchronizing clocks over large distances. How else could 
we describe the fact that whether the event has one or two time coordinates depends on which 
reference frame is being used to describe the event? And how else can we understand the fact 
that the choice of which of two apparently time like separated events is to the future of the other 
depends on the direction of motion of a very distant observer? 
This is classical physics, so whether an event is to the causal future or past of another event 
cannot be influenced by the direction that may be chosen for boosting an observer who is not only 
spacelike from the events in question, but at a cosmological distance from it. Therefor causality
