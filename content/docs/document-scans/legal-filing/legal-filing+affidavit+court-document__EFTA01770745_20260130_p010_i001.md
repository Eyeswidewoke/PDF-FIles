As for a resolution, one possible scenario is that Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs could grant registration to some of 
the targeted NGOs in the days ahead. This would clear the way for the courts to dismiss the charges against the NGOs 
or, perhaps more likely, for them to find those charged innocent. Such an approach could ease tensions while allowing 
Egypt's generals to officially maintain distance from the case. Yet Abul Naga could easily derail such a plan; throughout 
this debacle she and her allies have repeatedly employed carefully timed public remarks and leaks to reignite tensions. 
There is one more important faction in Cairo to consider: the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party, 
which now boasts a plurality of seats in the Egyptian Parliament. The People's Assembly has only been in session since 
January 23 and has yet to pass any legislation pertaining to the NGO crisis. Eventually, however, it will be up to the 
parliament to decide whether to pass a more permissive NGO law in line with international standards. 
So far, the signals from the Brotherhood have been contradictory. On one hand, it is in the group's interest to support a 
freer environment for NGOs, considering the large number of Islamist associations aligned with the movement. This was 
reflected in a recent op-ed by Brotherhood General Guide Mohammad Badie, who wrote, "All political, intellectual, 
social, cultural and economic trends and forces in the country -- along with civil society -- must be allowed to operate 
and express their views." On the other hand, some Brotherhood leaders are taking a hard stand against foreign funding, 
unsurprising given that the movement is funded almost entirely by its Egyptian members and supporters. 
As lawmakers, however, Brotherhood members have also made comments about what a change in the U.S.-Cairo aid 
relationship could mean. On February 12, Essam el Erian, vice chair of the Freedom and Justice Party and chair of the 
Foreign Relations Committee in the new parliament, made news when he pronounced that an interruption of U.S. aid 
would be a violation of the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty and would open the door for Egypt to change other terms of 
the treaty. That is no small claim. For more than three decades, that agreement -- including the billions in aid every year 
from the United States -- has served as a foundation for security arrangements throughout the Middle East. 
Many observers have argued that the U.S. must maintain its assistance in order to preserve its leverage with the 
Egyptian military. But this crisis is exactly the moment to use this leverage. The fate of civil society in Egypt and beyond 
is very much at stake. If the second largest recipient of U.S. military aid can attack pro-democracy organizations with no 
real consequences, authoritarian governments worldwide will be emboldened to follow suit. As such, the administration 
should take a tougher line, making clear that military aid will certainly be interrupted unless the attacks on NGOs are 
halted and all charges are dropped. The White House deserves credit for having made support for civil society an 
important pillar of its approach to strengthening democracy worldwide. Now is the time to demonstrate the strength of 
that commitment.
