Conditions of Contract and Other Important Notices 
PASSENGERS ON A JOURNEY INVOLVING AN ULTIMATE DESTINATION OR A STOP IN A 
COUNTRY OTHER THAN THE COUNTRY OF DEPA RTURE ARE ADVISED THAT INTERNATIONAL 
TREATIES KNOWN AS THE MONTREAL CONVENTION, OR ITS PREDECESSOR, THE WARSAW 
CONVENTION, INCLUDING ITS AMENDMENTS (THE WARSAW CONVENTION SYSTEM), MAY 
APPLY TO THE ENTIRE JOURNEY, INCLUDING ANY PORTION THEREOF WITHIN A COUNTRY. 
FOR SUCH PASSENGERS, THE APPL ICABLE TREATY, INCLUDING SPECIAL CONTRACTS OF 
CARRIAGE EMBODIED IN ANY APPLICABLE TARIFFS, GOVERNS AND MAY LIMIT THE LIABILITY 
OF THE CARRIER. 
NOTICE of Liability Limitations 
The Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention system may be applicable to your journey 
and these Conventions govern and may limit the liability of air carriers for death or bodily injury, 
for loss of or damage to baggage, and for delay. 
Where the Montreal Convention applies, the limits of liability are as follows: 
1. There are no financial limits in respect of death or bodily injury. 
2. In respect of destruction, loss of, or damage or delay to baggage, 1,131 Special Drawing Rights 
(approximately EUR 1,200; US $1,800) per passenger in most cases. 
3. For damage occasioned by delay to your journey, 4,694 Special Drawing Rights (approximately 
EUR 5,000; US $7,500) per passenger in most cases. 
EC Regulation No. 88912002 requires European Community carriers to apply the provisions of the 
Montreal Convention limits to all carriage by them of passengers and their baggage by air. Many 
non-European Community carriers have elected to do so in respect of the carriage of passengers 
and their baggage. 
Where the Warsaw Convention system applies, the following limits of liability may apply: 
1. 16,600 Special Drawing Rights (approximately EUR 20,000; US $20,000) in respect of death or bodily 
injury if the Hague Protocol to the Convention applies, or 8,300 Special Drawing Rights (approximately 
EUR 10,000; US $10,000) if only the Warsaw Convention applies. Many carriers have voluntarily waived 
these limits in their entirety, and US regulations require that, for journeys to, from or with an agreed 
stopping place in the US, the limit may not be less than US $75,000. 
2. 17 Special Drawing Rights (approximately EUR 20; US $20) per kg for loss of or damage or delay to 
checked baggage, and 332 Special Drawing Rights (approximately EUR 400; US $400) for unchecked 
baggage. 
3. The carrier may also be liable for damage occasioned by delay. 
Further information may be obtained from the carrier as to the limits applicable to your journey. If 
your journey involves carriage by different carriers, you should contact each carrier for 
information on the applicable limits of liability. 
Regardless of which Convention applies to your journey, you may benefit from a higher limit of 
liability for loss of, damage or delay to baggage by making at check-in a special declaration of the 
value of your baggage and paying any supplementary fee that may apply. Alternatively, if the 
value of your baggage exceeds the applicable limit of liability, you should fully insure it before 
you travel. 
Time limit for action: Any action in court to claim damages must be brought within two years from the date 
of arrival of the aircraft, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived. Baggage claims: 
Written notice to the carrier must be made within 7 days of the receipt of checked baggage in the case of 
damage, and, in the case of delay, within 21 days from the date on which it was placed at the disposal of 
the passenger.
