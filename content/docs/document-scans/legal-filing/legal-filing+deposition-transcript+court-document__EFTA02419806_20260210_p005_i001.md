marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as 
described in this policy. 
If you open a PayPal account directly on a third party website or via a third party 
application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not 
directly on a PayPal website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or 
application and your information may be subject to their privacy policies. 
How you can restrict PayPal from sharing your personal information 
Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in 
certain instances. However, these laws also state that you cannot restrict other types of

to you in the notifications preferences.
