February 23, 2012 -= BEIRUT, Lebanon — Syria 
<http://topics.nytimes.comitopinews/international/countriesandter=itories/syria/index.html?inline=nyt-geo> 's 
downward spiral into more hellish conflict in cities like Hom= has provoked a new surge of outrage around the world, 
with Arab and many =estern countries searching for new ways to support protesters and activist=groups coming under 
the government's increasingly lethal assault. 
But as diplomats fr=m about 80 countries converge on Tunisia 
chttp://topics.nytimes.com/topinews/international/countriesandter=itoriesitunisiatindex.html?inline=nyt-geo> on 
Friday in search of a strategy to provide aid to Syria's b=leaguered citizens, they will find their efforts compromised even 
before t=ey begin by the lack of a cohesive opposition leadership. 
Nearly a year after=the uprising began, the opposition remains a fractious collection of polit=cal groups, longtime exiles, 
grass-roots organizers and armed militants, a=l deeply divided along ideological, ethnic or sectarian lines, and too 
disjointed to agree on even the rudimen=s of a strategy to topple President Bashar al-Assad's government. 
The need to build a=united opposition will be the focus of intense discussions at what has bee= billed as the inaugural 
meeting of the Friends of Syria. Fostering some s=mblance of a unified protest movement, possibly under the umbrella 
of an exile alliance called the Syrian National Council, will be a theme hovering in the background. </=pan> 
The council's int=rnal divisions have kept Western and Arab governments from recognizing it =s a kind of government in 
exile, and the Tunis summit meeting will probabl= not change that. Russia, Syria's main international patron, is avoiding 
the meeting entirely. 
The divisions and s=ortcomings within the council were fully on display last week when its 10-=ember executive 
committee met at the Four Seasons Hotel in Doha, Qatar —=its soaring lobby bedecked with roses and other red flowers 
left over from Valentine's Day. 
The council has bee= slow on critical issues like recognizing the transformation of the Syrian=uprising from a nonviolent 
movement to an armed insurrection, according to=members, diplomats and other analysts. 
Aside from represen=ing only about 70 percent of a range of groups opposing Mr. Assad, the cou=cil has yet to seriously 
address melding itself with the increasingly inde=endent internal alliances in Horns and other cities across Syria trapped 
in an uneven battle for survival, they s=id, warning that the council runs the risk of being supplanted. 
"They were in a c=nstant, ongoing struggle, which delayed anything productive and any real w=rk that should be done 
for the revolution," said Rima Fleihan, an activi=t who crawled through barbed wire fences to Jordan from Syria last 
September to escape arrest. She was representing=Syria's Local Coordination Committees, an alliance of grass-roots 
activi=ts, on the council until she quit in frustration this month. 
"They fight more =han they work," Ms. Fleihan said. "People are asking why they have fai=ed to achieve any 
international recognition, why no aid is reaching the pe=ple, why are we still being shelled?" 
Even by comparison =ith Libya, where infighting among rival militias and the inability of the =ransitional National Council 
to exert authority fully created turmoil afte= the successful uprising there, Syria's opposition appears scattered. 
Well before NATO in=ervened in Libya, groups hostile to Col. Muammar el•Qaddafi leveraged the =uge chunk of eastern 
Libya they held around Benghazi into the attempt to c=aim the whole country. A unified focus on the rebellion 
submerged most overt political differences for a time. </=pan> 
The United States a=d other Western governments are also wary of the uncertain role of Islamis=s in Syria. The Muslim 
Brotherhood and other organized Islamist groups wer= more thoroughly suppressed in Syria than in Egypt, and their
