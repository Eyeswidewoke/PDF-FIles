significant loyalty to this country. Some of those expats felt optimistic about recent 
announcements made by some real estate companies that property buyers in certain 
projects in Dubai or Ajman will be offered "permanent UAE residency." Other companies 
have completely closed the door of speculation regarding the same issue. How does the 
government perceive=2 Othe "Permanent Residency" promise? And are there any eventual 
plans to adopt it in the UAE? 
Offering residency is absolutely far beyond the jurisdiction of any real estate company. It is a sovereign issue 
governed by laws and regulations. But I wonder if one buys property in London, Paris, Cairo, or Beirut does this 
mean obtaining a permanent residency there? We are very keen to ensure convenient conditions for expat 
property owners. However, we will be issuing a new law that includes a long multi-visit permit soon.

The IRE has proven remarkable capability in managing previous crises, including the 
Gulf First or Second Wars and 9/11 events in the US. What are the steps endorsed by the 
country's supreme leadership to overcome the current financial crisis? And do these 
measures include re-evaluating the UAE's strategy and its plans for the coming few years? 
Revisiting and re-evaluating strategies and plans are ongoing processes. They aren't only restricted to times of 
crises. Life is full of changes and developments, but only the clear-headed can effectively monitor and examine 
these changes and identify their trends and then determine how much these developments will impact their own 
strategies and plans.

Some Western media are trying to defame the UA E either through exaggerating the impact 
of the economic downturn on Dubai, or through inaccurate reports such as Human Rights 
Watch's on the Media Law in the UAE. What do you think are the reasons behind such 
campaigns? And what is your response to these campaigns? 
We don't care who stands behind such campaigns, but rather pay attention to the content of these reports either 
issued by media or international nongovernmental organizations. We deal with such reports with absolute 
objectivity -- for example when producers of these reports express their wish to visit the UAE and meet 
concerned officials, we open our doors for them and welcome all constructive discussions, offering them full 
briefings on all facts. We attentively listen to their views and, I like to think, so do they. 
Regarding Human Rights Watch's report on the UAE's new draft media law, the international organisation's 
officials were in the country last week. They met with the concerned UAE officials who defended the law and 
disputed the report's inaccurate remarks, explaining the law's different clauses and articles. They tried to steer the 
report's producers away from any misleading interpretations of its content.

The government has taken significant steps to support the financial services and property 
industries in the UAE. Are you happy with the results so far?
