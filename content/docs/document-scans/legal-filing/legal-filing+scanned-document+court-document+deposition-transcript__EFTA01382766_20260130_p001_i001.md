Table of Contra 
No Cumulative Voting 
Under Delaware law, the right to vote cumulatively does not exist unless the certificate of incorporation specifically authorizes 
cumulative voting. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not authorize cumulative voting. Therefore. stockholders holding a 
majority in voting power of the shares of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors will be able to elect all our directors. 
Special Stockholder Meetings 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that special meetings of our stockholders may be called at any time only 
by or at the direction of the Board or the chairman of the Board; provided. however, at any time when shares of our Class B common gook remain 
outstanding. special meetings of our stockholders shall also be called by the Board or the chairman of the Board at the request of KKR. Our 
amended and restated bylaws prohibit the conduct of any business at a special meeting other than as specified in the notice for such meeting. These 
provisions may have the effect of deferring. delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of our Company. 
Requirements for Advance Notification of Director Nominations and Stockholder Proposals 
Our amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of 
candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the Board or a committee of the Board. In order for any 
matter to be "properly brought" before a meeting. a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice requirements and provide us with certain 
information. Generally. to be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 
120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws also 
specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder's notice. Our amended and restated bylaws allow the chairman of the meeting at a 
meeting of the stockholders to adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings which may have the effect of precluding the conduct of 
certain business at a meeting if the rules and regulations are not followed. These provisions may also defer, delay or discourage a potential acquirer 
from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to influence or obtain control of our 
Company. 
Stockholder Action by Written Consent 
Pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken 
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if a conrent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the 
holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a 
meeting at which all shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, unless our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation provides otherwise. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will preclude stockholder action by written consent once 
no shares of our Class B common stock remain outstanding. 
Supermajorby Provisions 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that the Board is expressly 
authorized to make, alter. amend, change. add to. rescind or repeal. in whole or in part, our amended and restated bylaws without a stockholder vote 
in any matter not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. For as long as shares 
of our Class B common stock remain outstanding. any amendment. alteration. rescission or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws by our 
stockholders will require the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of our stock present in person or represented 
by proxy and entitled to vote on such amendment. alteration, rescission or repeal. Once no shares of our Class 13 common stock remain outstanding.
