As I said earlier, the Control Factor is "active" and =E2$4continuous" so we must constantly monitor and 
combat it.=C2*Like "Whack-a-Mole," just as we may think we have add=essed it, another variation pops right up. I use 
the terms "addict=E2$4 and "enabler" because we truly need a form of reh=b to break the habitual power of the 
Control Factor and bec=use our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between=a typical addict and 
his enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an ad=ict to kick his habit, so does the enabler act essentially addicted to his 
behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship involves the transfer of responsibility for our 
Islamic Enemyt>=99s hate and resultant actions onto us with our response framed essentiall= as an effort to do what we 
can to try to address the Enemy's grie=ance. (Your book, <http://www.amazon.com/United-Hate-Romance-=yranny-
Terror/dp/1935071602/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=3D1357362028&sr=1-1&keywords=united+in+hate> , 
describes this addiction to hate in detail.=u> 
The key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for ou= Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant actions 
back to it and ta=e responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can=about the enemy. We must 
unwind our inappropriate projections and introjec=ions and rediscover who we are and are not. We must speak up. We 
must supp=rt those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are consistent with=our principles. And we must 
stalk the Control Factor, constantly be on guard for its intrusion. This is an indivi=ual endeavor as each of our Control 
Factors uses its own methods. The=book gives plenty of examples of each maneuver discussed but it is importa=t for 
each of us to discover the unique workings of his own mind. That tak=s the work of the Inner Jihad. 
FP: Share with our readers what you mean by the "Turnarou=d Moment." 
Siegel: There is a moment in=typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed to thei= limit. 
They then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthle=s as the threat they face. No more moral high 
ground; no more futile attem=ts to ignore or change the threat's essence. As Lee Harris describ=d in The Suicide of 
Reason <http://www.amazon.com/Suicide-Reason-Radical-Islams-
Thr=at/dp/B00167R9NW/ref=sr_l_l?s=books&ie=UTF88(qid=1360128507=amp;sr=1-
3.8ikeywords=lee+harris+suic%20ide+of+reason> , it is the willingness o r license to be (not necessarily actually being) as 
ruthless that is c=itical. It is a mental state that sheds all the prior counter-productive e=forts at denial to finally clearly 
focus on the threat faced. Part of the =nner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner rather than later.=/u> 
FP: You suggest that "mirroring" should be used a= part of our arsenal. Tell us about it. 
Siegel:=Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict respons=bility that we have been 
inappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict=enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like the addict, the enemy uses a 
less =imiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates aggression =hile we respond only. Mirroring means 
that we demonstrate our willingness =o act symmetrically, to be governed by the same rules. It is stunning how =uch is 
accomplished when one's attitude simply is clear that he will do what is necessary; often not much else is needed as the 
a=dict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally changed. But other times =ction is absolutely needed. 
Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat =he enemy as it treats us carries great meaning. Imagine (international 
law=aside) if Israel announced that from now on it will mirror Hamas such that=if civilian populations are targeted by 
bombs from Gaza, Israel will =o the same (it is accused of such anyway). The population might fina=ly rethink and take 
responsibility for its privilege of voting its leaders= As stated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we mirror we 
teac= the other the effects of his behavior. 
Conversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases=where it is necessary to highlight 
our differences with the enemy. Just th=s week, an disingenuous report was issued by an NGO drawing an 
equivalence=between Palestinian and Israeli schoolbooks claiming that both sides have their relativistic " narratives." 
Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch <http://www.palwatch.org/>'s website has demonstrated=for years, there is 
nothing in the West anywhere comparable to the hatred =pewed daily by the Palestinian Authority, including through its 
education =ystem. It is interesting to note that while the US State Department initia=ly funded the "study,"- in what 
appears to be an attempt t= sanitize the PA's record so that the US can continue to fund the =A against the spirit of US
