S-1/A 
The following description summarizes the material terms of our securities. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain 
all the information that is important to you. 
Capital Stock 
Class A and Class B Common Stock 
All issued and outstanding shares of our common stock will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and non-
assessable. All authorized but unissued shares of our common stock will be available for issuance by our board of directors without 
any further stockholder action, except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Our amended and 
restated certificate of incorporation provides that, except with respect to voting rights and conversion rights, the Class A common 
stock and Class B common stock are treated equally and identically. 
Voting Rights. 
Holders of Class A common stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by 
the stockholders. The holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock will generally vote together as a single 
class on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, unless otherwise required by Delaware law or our amended and 
restated certificate of incorporation. The holders of common stock will not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.

Dividend Rights. 
Holders of common stock will be entitled to ratably receive dividends if, as. and when declared from time 
to time by our board of directors at its own discretion out of funds legally available for that purpose, after payment of dividends 
required to be paid on outstanding preferred stock, if any. Under Delaware law, we can only pay dividends either out of "surplus" or 
out of the current or the immediately preceding year's net profits. Surplus is defined as the excess, if any, at any given time, of the 
total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory capital. The value of a corporation's assets can be measured in a 
number of ways and may not necessarily equal their book value. 
Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions. 
Upon our dissolution, liquidation, or winding-up, the assets legally available for 
distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of our common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all 
outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares 
of preferred stock. 
Conversion. 
Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share 
of our Class A common stock. In addition, each share of our Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of our 
Class A common stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except certain transfers to entities, including certain charities 
and foundations, to the extent the transferor retains sole dispositive power and exclusive voting control with respect to the shares 
of Class B common stock, and certain other transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or upon 
the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, voting separately as a 
class. All outstanding shares of our Class B common stock will convert into shares of our Class A common stock when the shares 
of our Class B common stock represent less than 5% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B 
common stock. 
Other Matters. 
The common stock will have no preemptive rights pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws. There will be no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable 
to the common stock. All outstanding shares of our Class A common stock will be fully paid and non-assessable, and the shares of 
our Class A common stock offered in this offering, upon payment and delivery in accordance with the underwriting agreement, will 
be fully paid and non-assessable. 
Preferred Stock 
Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock will be issuable 
from time to time, in one or more series, with the designations of the series, the voting rights of the shares of the series Of any), 
the powers, preferences, or relative, participation, optional, or other special rights (if any), and any qualifications, limitations, or 
restrictions thereof as our board of directors from time to time may adopt by resolution (and without further stockholder approval), 
subject to certain limitations. Each series will consist of that number of shares as will be stated and expressed in the certificate of 
designations providing for the issuance of the stock of the series.
