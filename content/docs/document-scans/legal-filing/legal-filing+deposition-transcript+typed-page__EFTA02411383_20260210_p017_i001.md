This is not unalloyed joy for the creditor nations. Once the exposure of a creditor to a borrower gets sufficiently 
large, the two sink or swim together. The relationship between China and America has been described as vendor 
financing, in which the Chinese lend the Americans the money to buy their cheap manufactured goods; a collapse 
in American demand would cause substantial unemployment (and social unrest) in China. 
The longstanding system of vendor financing may have encouraged the rich world to concentrate on consumption 
rather than investment and to enjoy the resulting "artificial" growth, like a child on a sugar high. Richard Koo, 
who wrote a book about the Japanese recession, "The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics", refers to a debt-financed 
boom as "cherry-blossom" economics. He recounts the tale of the two brothers who bought a barrel of sake to sell 
to revellers at Japan's cherry-blossom festival. But instead of taking money from the thirsty crowd, each brother 
charged the other for a cup of sake, then used the proceeds to buy a cup for himself, and so on. The brothers 
ended the day drunk and empty-handed. 
Jeremy Grantham of GMO, a fund-management group, is a detached and cynical observer of the financial and 
economic scene. The way he sees it, "all debt seems to do is bring growth forward a little. If you get people to 
spend 1% more than their income every year, after 20 years they are going backwards because interest expense 
is eating up more of their salary." 
Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at SEB Group in Sweden, is equally pessimistic. "The leverage-led growth model 
is dead," he says. "Households and corporates can increase borrowing and enhance today's consumption and 
investments but that requires that we can assume higher future incomes and expected returns and/or rising asset 
values. And this is not certain." 
Running out of ammunition 
The debt burden may also have had a distorting effect on economic policy. In the 1960s and 1970s governments 
grappled with a wage-price spiral in which demands for higher wages forced companies to increase their prices, 
which in turn triggered demands for higher wages. The past two decades have seen a debt-interest rate spiral. It 
starts off with the private sector borrowing a lot of money. This is followed by a crisis in which the central bank 
cuts interest rates to help borrowers. That encourages the private sector to borrow more, which makes it all the 
more imperative for central banks to come to the rescue when the next crisis comes along. With short-term 
interest rates now at 1% or less in America, Britain, Japan and the euro zone, this process cannot go any further. 
If the 1960s and 1970s produced consumer inflation, the debt-interest rate spiral created asset inflation. In 2000 
this pushed share prices to unprecedented peaks; indeed many stockmarkets have yet to regain the levels they 
reached a decade ago. Now the support of asset prices has entered a new stage, with central banks buying assets 
(in particular, government and mortgage-backed bonds) directly to boost the financial sector. 
Indeed, that sector was the biggest beneficiary of this spiral. Before the credit crunch it generated some 35% of 
all domestic profits in America. A highly sophisticated society would be expected to spend quite a lot on finance, 
but that figure still looked too high. "We have been transferring aggregate income and wealth to the financial-
services industry. All this financial activity is just a deadweight on the system," says Mr Grantham. 
During the debt boom the optimists argued that the huge growth in derivatives did not add to risk in the system 
because every buyer was matched by a seller. Nobody drew attention to the fact that with each new instrument 
the finance sector took a cut in the form of a fee, or the spread between buying and selling prices. As derivative 
was piled on derivative, debt on debt, the cut got ever larger. 
Financial profits may have artificially boosted the government's revenues across a range of items, from corporate 
profits to capital gains and taxes on bonuses. Some of that revenue may now be lost for good. Mr Koo points out 
in his book that whereas in 1990 Japanese tax receipts were 160 trillion ($416 billion), in 2005 they had come 
down to only 149 trillion, even though Japan's nominal GDP was 13% higher. When revenues were booming, 
governments thought they would keep coming and increased their spending accordingly. Now it is hard to see how 
the gap can be closed.
