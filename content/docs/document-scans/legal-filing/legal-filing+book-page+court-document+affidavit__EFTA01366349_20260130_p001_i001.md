seniors to the under-banked market, having revenues of more than SI.3 billion when sold to Lone Star 
Partners in 2014. 
We believe the combined team possesses the core characteristics of an ideal team for a special purpose 
acquisition corporation. This combined team is a mix of what we view to be successful dealmakers or operators. 
with experience across multiple deal types, including complicated special situations and as senior operators across 
a variety of businesses and industries, having completed more than 125 transactions collectively. This combined 
team has built a meaningful proprietary deal sourcing network in a wide range of industries and business lines that 
should allow us to source deals that other investors could not. Through these endeavors. this combined team has 
what we believe is a long standing track record of value creation, both as investors and for investors, across the 
gamut of private equity or direct public and private company investing. Our network and current affiliations 
across the team will allow us to lean heavily on an existing infrastructure of resources that will twig in due 
diligence, underwriting and ultimately structuring an acquisition. We may also leverage our network of third party 
advisors as needed. 
With respect to the foregoing examples, past performance by our management team or sponsor team is not a 
guarantee either (0 of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will 
be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. Furthermore. in considering any past 
performance information contained herein, you should bear in mind that actual returns depend on. among other 
factors, future operating results, the value of the investments and market conditions at the time of disposition, any 
related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may differ from the assumptions on which 
the overall performance of any prior investments arc based. 
Business Strategy and Sourcing of Targets 
Our acquisition and value creation strategy will be to identify. acquire and, after our initial business 
combination, to build a company in an industry that complements the experience and expertise of our combined 
team. Our acquisition selection process will leverage their deep, broad and trusted network of industry, private 
equity sponsor and lending community relationships as well as their relationships with public and private 
companies at a board and management level, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys and accountants. We 
believe this should provide us with a breadth of business combination opportunities as well as opportunities for 
improving the target's business post-merger. Over the course of their careers, our combined team have developed 
a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships, which we intend to use to source merger targets which 
will not be subject to highly competitive auctions. Their capabilities include both deep and diverse strengths. as
