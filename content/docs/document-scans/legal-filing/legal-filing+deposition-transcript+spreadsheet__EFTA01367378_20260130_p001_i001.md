Primary Growth Drivers 
Volume growth over the next two years is primarily driven from re-developed 
mature assets (Ekofisk II) as well as from the bringing on-line of several growth 
projects in both the UK and Norway. However, the longer-term viability of 
North Sea production growth is most strongly correlated with the successful 
(i.e. timely) development of the massive Johan Sverdrup field which was 
recently sanctioned in February. We estimate North Sea crude production to 
hold broadly flat (-2.5 MMb/d) through 2016 before declining to 2.2 MMb/d in 
2019 w/ recovery in 2020 as Johan Sverdrup is brought on-line. 
Primary Risks 
In our view, the impact of project delays is mostly muted as all growth projects 
are currently either on-stream or under development with growth from the 
currently producing Ekofisk field alone, estimated at -15% of 2014-2016 North 
Sea. Post 2016. we expect a decline in the North Sea until the end of the 
decade/ramp of the massive Johan Sverdrup field (+300 Mb/d of production 
growth in 2020). The chief risk to North Sea production on a go-forward basis 
will focus on managing declines. We note, however, that Statoil (covered by 
our European counterparts), alone, accounts for -20% of the oil production 
growth from the North Sea over the next 3 years and any announcements of a 
change to the company's planned activity in the region would likely have a 
material impact on the forecast. 
Managing Declines: For a more detail look at North Sea decline, please see 
our case study on page 20 of this publication. In summary, we assume a 
decline rate (ex growth rates and redevelopment projects) of -12% during our 
forecast period and assume a contribution of -3% from prior year production 
in normalized outages within the forecasted 12% forecast. We see some 
upside to our forecasted decline rates as operators (in the Norwegian North 
Sea) benefit from exchange rate tail-winds that will soften cuts to brown field 
spending. Assuming that -20% of a company's NCS spend is denominated in 
the local currency (S Kroner), we estimate that a 25% YoY reduction in SUSD 
denominated capex (proxy for an industry average) will likely result in an 
"actual" 10% YoY cut spend. Further, a reallocation of capital away from more 
costly frontier plays in the Barents Sea towards more immediate cash flow 
accretive brown-field projects can also provide upside to our current forecast. 
On our base case assumes declines of 12%, and estimate a 1% revision to the 
assumed decline to result in a swing of - 125 Mb/d to our 2017 outlook.
