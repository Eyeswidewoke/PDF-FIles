people took to the streets, but, unlike elsewhere, their rallyin= cry was never "the people want the downfall of the 
regime"; rat=er, they wanted its "reform". 
Nor does Jordan suf=er from those sectarian antagonisms that have disfigured what, in Syria, b=gan as a popular, 
peaceful movement for freedom and democracy. It has no K=rds; it is almost uniformly Sunni. Most of its people favour 
the Syrian rebels; but the regime itself has sou=ht "neutral" ground between the two sides, fearing reprisals fro= one or 
the other if it didn't. But events of the past two weeks show just=how serious Jordan's exposure to the drama next door 
could become. These include the first death of a Jordanian soldier

bound-militantsk along the Syrian-Jordanian border; clashes=between the army and groups of jihadists seeking to 
cross it; and the unma=king of an alleged al-Qaida plot and the arrest of 11 men — all Jordania=s — planning multiple 
bomb and mortar attacks on high-profile targets in Amman. The noted Jordanian columnist Ur=yb al-Rintawi recalled the 
2005 bombings that killed 60 people in three Am=an hotels. These were staged by the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a 
Jordanian= from his base in Anbar — the western, exclusively Sunni province of Iraq — then a virtual fief of al-Qaida. Fo= 
Jordan, Rintawi said, Syria now risked becoming "Anbar 2"— bu= an "Anbar" with only 100km of populated territory 
between it an= Jordan's capital, rather than 1,000km of empty desert away. 
Disturbing, of cour=e. Yet terrorism on its own never really works; it requires the "righ=" context to be effective. And, in 
the final analysis, it is on Jorda='s basic political, social and economic health that its ability to resist the Syrian contagion 
depends. And Jordan's heal=h is, in fact, looking increasingly poor. The relationship between ruler a=d ruled is 
deteriorating, as the latter intensify their pressures for refo=ms and the former persists in efforts to dilute or block them 
altogether. 
On the constitution=l front, King Abdullah has made what are seen as minor, cosmetic changes t=at do little to transfer 
ultimate authority from the palace to parliament =nd the people. 
He also insists on =reserving an electoral law that favours the Transjordanian segment of the =opulation - the minority 
from which the monarchy traditionally derived i=s support — at the expense of the urban one. That penalises the 
numerically larger, better educated, economically =ore productive segment, the Palestinians. They have long considered 
themse=ves second-class citizens and, if things got bad, this faultline could be =s dangerous as those sectarian and 
ethnic ones now playing havoc in neighbouring countries. 
The law also disadv=ntages the Muslim Brotherhood, Jordan's most powerful political party, who=e support is strongest 
in urban areas and especially among the Palestinian=. It now seems headed for a major confrontation with the regime 
over parliamentary elections due at the end of the year. 1=, as threatened, it boycotts these, that will produce a 
parliament with no=real legitimacy, making a mockery of Abdullah's reformist pretensions. 
Then there are the =alafis. Some of Jordan's have gone to Syria to fight the heretic Alawite r=gime, now a prime target 
for Sunni jihadists everywhere. After at first se=ming to turn a blind eye to this, Jordan is now seeking to prevent it, for it 
threatens to boomerang against itself= As the alleged al-Qaida plot shows, for some Jordanian Salafis jihad in S=ria is 
merely a preparation before returning home to take on their own reg=me which — orthodox Sunni though it is — is 
impious on other grounds. 
Whatever the outcom= of the Syrian civil war, Jordan's own reform-related troubles are now suc= that it might make 
little difference whether Assad survives or falls. For=Abdullah both alternatives look bad. If Assad survives, with at least 
the perceived connivance of Jordan, that =ill increase the hostility of Jordan's Islamist-led opposition towards 
the=throne. If he falls, that will greatly strengthen them, because they will =ave the full support of the new order —
doubtless heavily Islamist — that will emerge in Assad's place= In either case the more stubbornly the king resists the 
clamour for =eaningful reform, the more the opposition will be inclined to go the whole=hog and raise the slogan: "The 
people want the downfall of the regime."
