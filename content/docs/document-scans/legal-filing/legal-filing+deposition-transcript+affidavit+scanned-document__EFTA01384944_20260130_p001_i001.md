additional $15 million in revolving credit facilities. Although, as discussed in "Use of Proceeds" we 
intend to pay down our current indebtedness with the proceeds of the offering, we intend to incur 
additional debt in connection with future acquisitions or for other purposes. In addition, if we are 
successful in acquiring a portfolio of properties, such as the portfolio of properties for which we 
recently submitted a bid to the seller, although we intend to maintain leverage consistent with our 
previously stated leverage range, our leverage may increase significantly over a shorter period of time 
than if we acquire properties on a farm by farm basis. If necessary, we also may borrow funds to make 
distributions to our stockholders in order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes. To the extent that we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt at 
maturity, it may be necessary to refinance the debt through debt or equity financings, which may not be 
available on acceptable terms or at all and which could he dilutive to our stockholders. If we are 
unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms or at all, we may be forced to dispose of farms at 
inopportune times or on disadvantageous terms, which could result in losses. lb the extent we cannot 
meet our future debt service obligations, we will risk losing to foreclosure some or all of our farms that 
may be pledged to secure our obligations. An increase in our degree of leverage also could make us 
more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. 
Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of 
operations. 
We may experience interest rate volatility in connection with variable-rate debt that we may owe or 
may make, from time to time. The interest rates on our revolving credit facilities are variable. Although 
we have not entered into any derivative contracts to attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations, we may, in a manner consistent with our qualification as a REIT, seek to mitigate our 
exposure to changing interest rates by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate 
swaps and caps in the future. These derivative instruments involve cost and risk and may not be 
effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes. Risks inherent in derivative instruments 
include the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts may be unable to perform their obligations, 
the risk that interest rates move in a direction contrary to, or move slower than the period 
contemplated by, the direction or time period that the derivative instrument is designed to cover, and 
the risk that the terms of such instrument will not be legally enforceable. While we intend to design 
our hedging strategies to protect against adverse movements in interest rates, derivative instruments 
that we are likely to use may also involve immediate costs, which could reduce our ability to make 
distributions to our stockholders. Likewise, ineffective hedges, as well as the occurrence of any of the 
risks inherent in derivatives, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or reduce your 
overall investment returns. We will review each of our derivative contracts and will periodically evaluate 
their effectiveness against their stated purposes. 
complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax 
liabilities. 
The REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Generally, income from 
a hedging transaction we enter into either to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to 
borrowings incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets, or to manage the risk of 
currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain (or any property which generates such 
income or gain) that constitutes "qualifying income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income 
tests applicable to REIM, does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross 
income tests, provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable 
sections of the Code and Treasury Regulations. lb the extent that we enter into other types of hedging 
transactions, or fail to make the proper tax identifications, the income from those transactions is likely 
to be treated as non•qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. As a result of these 
rules, we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those
