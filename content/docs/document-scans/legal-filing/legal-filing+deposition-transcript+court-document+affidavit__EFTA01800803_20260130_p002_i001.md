brain cortex. The clock shows stem cells removed from embryos to be extremely young and the brains of centenarians 
to be about 100. 
"Such tight correlations suggest there is somet=ing seemingly immutable going on in cells," says Elizabeth 
Blackburn of the University of California, San Francisco, who won a Nobel prize for her research on telomeres — caps on 
the ends of chromosomes that shorten with age. It could be a clue to undiscovered biology, she suggests. And there may 
be medical implications in cases in which epigenetic estimates do not match a person's birth certificate. 
In the months since Horvath's paper appeared, other researchers have replicated and extended the results. The 
study has stirred up excitement about potential applications, but also debate about the underlying biology at work. 
"It's something new," says Peter Vissch=r, chair of quantitative genetics at the University of Queensland in 
Australia. "If he's right that the=e is something like an inherently epigenetic clock at work in ageing, that is very 
interesting. It must be important." 
Clocking on 
Horvath kept his vow to the Gilgamesh project by supplementing his PhD in mathematics with a doctorate in 
biostatistics, which led to a position in the genetics department at UCLA in 2000. After receiving tenure in 2006, he 
began to focus on ageing by searching for shifts that occur in gene activity over the course of life. A doctoral student 
took the lead, feeding gene-transcription data through statistical filters in the hope of turning up a robust biomarker for 
age. But after more than a year, Horvath and the student had found no strong clues. If any such signal exists in gene-
transcript data, they concluded, it is hopelessly swamped by the noisy variations from organ to organ and person to 
person. With little to show for their work, "= decided to keep quixotic projects like this away from students and 
postdocs," Horvath says. 4>=9Clt didn't seem fair to risk their careers." 
"The big question is whether the clock measures a biochemical process that serves a purpose." 
Things began to look up in 2011, however. As part of a team led by his UCLA colleague Eric Vilain, Horvath had 
analysed methylation patterns in DNA extracted from the saliva of 68 adults. The researchers were looking for an 
epigenetic pattern that correlated with sexual orientation. None turned up, but with the data in hand Horvath and his 
colleagues decided to see whether they could use it to predict age. 
In human DNA, methyl groups most often attach at 'CpG sites' — places where a cytosine precedes a= guanine 
in the DNA. A typical human genome contains more than 28 million such sites. But the microarray technology used to 
detect methylation samples finds only a fraction of them: older machines pin down just 27,000 sites and newer ones 
around 485,000. 
Horvath got lucky. He found success with a simple statistical model, which looked at how many cells in a drop of 
saliva have DNA methylated at just two particular CpG sites. The index roughly paralleled participants' ages with a 
correlation of 0.85, or 85%, and an average accuracy of about five years2 <http://www.natur..com/news/biomarkers-
and-ageing-the-clock-watcher-1.15014#b2> . 
While working on a subsequent study, Horvath identified methylation patterns that hewed even more closely to 
age in very different cell types, such as brain and blood. Suddenly, a goal that he had thought impossible — finding a 
biomarker for the=age of almost every part of the body — seemed attainable. 
But it would not be easy. He would have to pull together myriad data sets that included both peoples' ages and 
their DNA methylation information. Methylation profiles are used for many kinds of medical research — usually in areas 
other than ageing (see Nature 508, 22; 2014 <http://www.nature.com/uidfinder/1=.1038/508022a> ). And because of
