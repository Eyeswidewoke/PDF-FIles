Director Wray Unveils Cyber Threat Disruptions, Highlights Risks at Munich Security Conference 
Fox News (02/15, Hagstrom) reported that at the Munich Cyber Security Conference in Germany, Director Wray 
highlighted the significant threat posed by Chinese hackers affiliated with the CCP, stating that they have reached a 
"fever pitch" in their cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies. He warned, "You might find your companies 
harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies," and emphasized the presence of PRC hackers in 
critical infrastructure, ready to act if geopolitical lines are crossed. Director Wray noted the escalation of 
preparations for cyberattacks, particularly against U.S. oil and gas sectors since 2011, pointing out, "What we're 
seeing now is China's increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack 
whenever Beijing decides the time is right." He reiterated the daily cyber threat to the U.S. in his testimony before 
Congress and underscored a report from the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory that revealed prolonged unauthorized 
access to U.S. infrastructure by Chinese hackers, highlighting the risks of significant disruptions in case of U.S.-China 
conflicts. The FBI posted a transcript of Director Wray's remarks at the Munich Security Conference. 
Director Wray Says FBI Disrupted Russian Intelligence Hacking Network 
CNN (02/15, Lyngaas) added that at the Munich Security Conference, Director Wray announced the disruption of a 
vast network of over 1,000 internet routers hacked by Russia's GRU military intelligence. According to the article, 
this network, or botnet, was used for espionage against the U.S. and its European allies. Through a court order, the 
operation successfully removed hackers from these compromised routers, effectively "locking the door behind 
them." The article explained that while addressing the global gathering of intelligence officials, Director Wray 
reiterated the longstanding concern over Russian and China-backed hacking groups infiltrating U.S. critical 
infrastructure, such as energy and telecommunications networks. He highlighted the potential for these adversaries 
to disable networks during a crisis, stating, "Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, we've 
seen Russia conducting reconnaissance on the US energy sector. And that's a particularly worrisome trend because 
we know that once access is established, the hacker can switch from information gathering to attack quickly and 
without notice." Director Wray also disclosed new intelligence on Russian military developments, specifically their 
efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space, framing Russia's behavior as consistent with its history of
