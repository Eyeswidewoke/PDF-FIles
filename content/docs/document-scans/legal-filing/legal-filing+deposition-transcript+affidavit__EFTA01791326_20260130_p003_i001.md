ab=olute forecast miss between ADP and private payrolls has been just 38k. Looking just at the last six months to 
September, the average discrepancy between the two surveys has been around 36k on an absolute basis, including a 
couple of recent months (June and August) where the two measures were virtually the same. For the record, the 
consensus is expecting today's ADP repo=t to show a +150k gain, lower than last month's +166k result. At the mo=ent, 
Bloomberg consensus is pointing to a +155k gain in next week's BLS pr=vate payrolls, and just a 115k gain in nonfarm 
payrolls (though these estimates will probably get revised after today's ADP). The ADP report is due b=fore the opening 
bell in New York, which will set the tone for trading before we get to the FOMC later in the day. 
Overnight markets are trading with a posit=ve tone across the board led by the TOPIX (+0.8%) and Hang Seng (+1.0%). 
The release of weaker than expected Japanese IP numbers (1.5% MoM vs 1.8% expec=ed) hasn't dampened sentiment 
in Japanese equities, and a strong gain in =SDJPY (+0.5%) is probably helping. The Chinese seven day repo rate continues 
to climb (+45bp to 5.85%) after yesterday's small RMB13bn liquidity i=jection by the PBoC was seen as mostly a symbolic 
move. Market chatter continues to suggest that the PBoC is attempting to limit recent consumer and house price 
inflation while others are attributing the recent money market rate rises to month-end effects and corporate tax 
payments. The rise in the repo rate hasn't stopped A-shares from posting solid gains (+1.0%) to=ay. Elsewhere S&P500 
futures are flat, after a strong run late yesterday.</=ont> 
Indeed yesterday saw another round of slig=tly softer US data that helped drive the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Dow Jones 
(+0.7%) to fresh highs. European markets started off on a weaker footing, after a number of earnings misses from banks 
saw financial stocks struggle at the open. The sentiment improved later in the day, thanks to stronger earnings from the 
likes of BP. Indeed, the DAX (+0.48%) managed to break above the 9000 mark for the first time in the minutes before the 
close. The positive sentiment was evident across asset classes including credit where the European senior and sub 
financials indices grinded to new series tights. In the UK, there is increasing market chatter about what the Chance=lor 
will decide in terms of RBS' problem assets. RBS subordinated paper c=ntinues to be better bid, perhaps on reports that 
Osborne will avoid a breakup of the group. 
Yesterday's US dataflow supported th=se arguing for a later start to the taper. US retail sales for September were down 
0.1% MoM (vs 0% expected) and retail sales ex auto and gas were up 0.4%, lower than the 0.5% expected. On the 
inflation side, September PPI was lower than expectations in the headline (-0.1% vs. +0.2% expected). Consumer 
confidence for October dropped sharply to 71.2 (vs 75.0 expected, 79.7 previous) probably due to the impact of the 
fiscal standoff in Washington. Most surprising of all was the gain in the USD (dollar index +0.46%) which strengthened in 
spite of the weaker than expected US data. This weighed on EURUSD (-0.3%) which had its sharpest fall in three weeks. 
Treasuries traded in a tight range between 2.50% to 2.53%. An uneventful Syr UST aucti=n helped 10yr yields close at 
2.50%, not far from where they are trading this morning. 
Today will be mostly about the FOMC announ=ement and the ADP employment report. Ahead of that, German CPI and 
unemployment data will be released together with the Spanish preliminary Q3 GDP report. It will be a busy day on the 
government bond calendar with new Italian 5 & 10yr, German 10yr and 7yr UST supply. In the US, the other data 
releases of note are the monthly budget statement and CPI (consensus 0.2% MoM vs 0.1% in August). General Motors 
reports earnings today before the opening bell — its always interesting to hear management's view= on global demand, 
particularly in light of Ford's upbeat assessment last week.<=font>
