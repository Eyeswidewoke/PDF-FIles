785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
In view of their failure to raise the predominance issue, Plaintiffs now suggest that 
Ipiredominance and commonality . . . are [both) part of Rule 23(b)(3)," such that a 
challenge concerning one should be treated as a challenge to both. Appellant's Reply Br. 
2. They are mistaken. 
Commonality, found in Rule 23(a)(2), asks whether the proposed class will "resolve an 
issue that is central to the validity of each of one of the claims in one stroke." EQT Prod. 
Co. v. Adair, 764 F.3d 347, 360 (4th Cir. 2014). Predominance, found in ['92k1] Rule 
23(b)(3), presents a "far more demanding" inquiry, Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 
U.S. 591, 624, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997), namely whether any common 
questions "pre-dominate over any questions affecting only individual members," Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Thus, while a "common issue" will establish commonality, that common 
issue only goes to one part of the predominance inquiry. Consequently, courts and parties 
must address these requirements separately, rather than muddle them together. See Vega 
v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 564 F.3d 1256, 1268-70 (11th Cir. 2009); In re Ins. Brokerage Litig., 
579 F.3d 241, 277 (3d Cir. 2009); accord Ealy v. Pinkerton Gov't Servs., Inc., 514 F. App'x 
299, 305 (4th Cir. 2013) (" r731 [T]he Rule 23(a) commonality requirement[] and the Rule 
23(b)(3) predominance requirement remain separate inquiries and the inquiries should not 
be 'blended."'). 
The majority excuses Plaintiffs' waiver because it believes that Plaintiffs "followed the 
district courts lead" in combining the two issues. Maj. op. at 55. Thus, even though 
commonality and predominance are legally distinct, the majority speculates that the district 
court did not treat them as such here. The majority's analysis mischaracterizes the district 
court's opinion. 
The district court did not just repeat back its commonality findings in determining that 
Plaintiffs' class failed as to predominance. To the contrary, the court expressly held that it 
could not find the required predominance "even if the Fourth Circuit subsequently 
conclude[d] that plaintiffs have identified a common issue that satisfies Rule 23(a)(2)." J.A. 
10956. The court then explained -- over several pages — that many different reasons 
underlay its predominance finding, including several individual questions that could 
"overwhelm" common ones. Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Trust Funds, 133 S. Ct. 
1184, 1196, 185 L. Ed. 2d 308 (2013). Because Plaintiffs heavily rely on anecdotal 
evidence, for instance, the district court correctly concluded that a jury 'would have to 
delve into the merits [*74] of each individual promotion decision" to determine whether 
each decision evidenced discrimination. J.A. 10959. Thus, a trial meant to resolve class-
wide issues would likely devolve into a series of mini-trials examining each promotion 
decision made in the Nucor plant. The court further acknowledged that "individual 
damages determinations," like those that would be required here, can "cut against class 
certification." J.A. 10956. Although it concluded that such damages determinations did not, 
standing alone, compel decertification in this case, J.A. 10958, they did provide the district 
court an additional basis for caution in making its predominance finding. See, e.g., Cooper 
v. So. Co., 390 F.3d 695, 722-23 (11th Cir. 2004), overruled on other grounds by Ash v. 
Tyson Foods, Inc., 546 U.S. 454, 126 S. Ct. 1195, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1053 (2006) (noting that 
individualized damage issues could swamp the advantages coming from an initial, class-
wide liability determination); accord Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F.3d 402, 421-22 
(5th Cir. 1998), cited with approval in Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417,
