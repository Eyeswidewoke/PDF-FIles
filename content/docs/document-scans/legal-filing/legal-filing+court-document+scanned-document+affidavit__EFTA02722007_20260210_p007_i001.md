In 2010, the figure was 785 a day. But each day, nearly as many Afghans have been trying to 
cross the border illegally in order to work in Iran.29 The economic difficulties in their 
country, as well as security-related issues, explain their desire to migrate. Such a situation 
will prevail, unless the potential refugees have actually a chance to have the better life, which 
they seek, in their own country. And it will be possible, to paraphrase Seyyed Mohammad 
Reza Sajjadi, the Iranian Permanent Representative at the United Nations Office in Geneva, 
the potential Afghan refugees will remain in their homes only if there are 'secure and decent' 
conditions in the country.30 Again here, this burden, several decades old, makes of Tehran a 
political entity that cannot satisfy itself with wishy-washy declarations about Afghan 
stabilisation. For Iran, the instability of its neighbour has true economic and social 
consequences that could have a political impact, if a sizable part of the Iranian citizenry is 
unsatisfied with the way the authorities deal with this issue.

(2) The Taliban or Afghanistan as a 'Rogue State' 
For Iran, Afghanistan has been a source of troubles in terms of security issues since the 
Taliban came to power. At this period, from an Iranian point of view, the 'failed' Afghan 
state became a 'rogue' entity. At least, some leaders of the Taliban, particularly the ones 
influenced by an anti-Shia sentiment, were planning for a direct conflict with the Iran if their 
internal enemies could first be dealt with.3I From 1996, the new Afghan 'Emirate' made its 
intentions clear when it gave asylum to the Sunni Baluch and Turkmen activists from Iran. 
who were in violent opposition to Tehran.32 The Iranian concerns were kindled by such open 
hostility from the Taliban, so much so that Robert Baer33 reports that Iran was ready to go to 
war at one time to take control of Western Afghanistan. Tehran's aim was to prevent 
Taliban's control of the Afghan-Iranian border." Still, despite their anxieties, the Iranians 
seem to have thought that a deal could be made with Pakistan in order to stabilise 
Afghanistan in a way acceptable to all the countries in the region, Iran included, and without

in the mind of the ideological 'hawks' around Mullah Omar. See on this subject Steve Coll, Ghost Wars,
