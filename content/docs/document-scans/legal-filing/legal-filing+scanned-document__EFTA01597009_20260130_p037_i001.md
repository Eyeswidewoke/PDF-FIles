Entire Agreement and Changes to the Agreement 
This Client Relationship Agreement and the related documents, including the General 
Terms and Conditions and the rest of the Agreements and Disclosures booklet form the 
entire "Agreement" between you and us with respect to your account(s). This Agreement 
supersedes any prior representations or agreements. 
The accounts and services we offer may change over time. We may change our Agreement 
with you at any time by sending you a written notice of the change, and the changes will 
be effective on the date of the notice unless we specify a later date. We also may cease to 
offer services at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of your Accounts and 
our products and services constitutes your acceptance of the new terms and conditions. 
All changes by you to the Agreement will become effective only if offered in writing and 
signed by us. 
Applicable Law 
This Agreement, including the Arbitration provisions in the next paragraph, and its 
enforcement, are governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to 
such State's choice of law or conflict of laws provisions. The Agreement is binding on all 
parties provided that there is no inconsistency with the Federal securities laws or the 
Federal or State banking laws. In connection with any Card issued, the respective 
Cardholder Agreement shall be governed by Federal law and the law designated by the
