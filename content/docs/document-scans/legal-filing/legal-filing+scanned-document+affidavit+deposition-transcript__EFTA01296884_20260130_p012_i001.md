United States Courts Opinions: Supreme Court of New York: Neary v Burns US Official 
News April 1, 2014 Tuesday 
distributions due to them from the net proceeds of this sale in violation of the Operating 
Agreement and applicable Limited Liability Company Law. Specifically, it alleges that 
Burns withheld from these sale proceeds the sum of $35,745.83 from Neary and the sum 
of $44,831.58 from Benevento. 
Plaintiffs' second amended complaint alleges three causes of action. Plaintiffs' first cause 
of action against 2784 LLC alleges that 2784 LLC is in possession and control of the funds 
wrongfully withheld from them by Burns from their share of distributions of the net sale 
proceeds of the 2784 premises in violation of the Operating Agreement and applicable law, 
and that they have been damaged in the total sum of $80,577.41, plus interest from March 
9, 2010. Plaintiffs' second cause of action alleges a direct claim by Neary against Bums, 
which asserts that Burns owed an independent fiduciary duty to Neary, as a member of 
2784 with a 6.133% ownership interest, that Burns wrongfully withheld the sum of 
$35,745.83 from his share of distributions from the net proceeds of the sale of the 2784 
premises, and that he is entitled to a judgment in this sum. Plaintiffs' third cause of action 
alleges a direct claim by Benevento against Burns, which asserts that Burns owed an 
independent fiduciary duty to Benevento as a member of 2784 LLC with a 9.2% ownership 
interest and/or as the holder of a 9.2% beneficial interest in 2784 LLC through the Estate 
of Julia, that Burns wrongfully withheld the sum of $44,831.58 from his share of 
distributions from the net proceeds of the sale of the 2784 premises, and that he is entitled 
to a judgment in this sum. 
On October 24, 2013, Burns filed his instant motion for an order dismissing plaintiffs' 
amended verified complaint. In his motion papers, Bums opposed plaintiffs' r6]motion to 
amend and sought an order denying plaintiffs' motion.[FN1] 2784 LLC has not submitted 
any papers with respect to Burns' motion, and it took no position at oral argument 
In support of their motion to amend, plaintiffs maintained that their proposed amendment 
was meritorious since they were entitled to their full share of distributions from these sale 
proceeds and that the withholding of over $80,000 from their distributions was wrongful 
and improper. Moreover, no prejudice was demonstrated by Burns with respect to the 
proposed amendment since it simply streamlines plaintiffs' amended complaint and does 
not assert any new facts or causes of action against Bums. In addition, there could be no 
prejudice to 2784 LLC since, as noted above, it has not as yet served an answer in this 
action, and prejudice to warrant denial of leave to amend requires some indication that the 
defendants were hindered in the preparation of their case or were prevented from taking 
some measure in support of their position (see McGhee v Odell, 96 AD3d 449, 450 [1st 
Dept 2012]; Kocourek v Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., 85 AD3d 502, 504 [1st Dept 2011]). 
Furthermore, while there was a two-year delay by plaintiffs in seeking such leave, 
discovery is ongoing, and depositions have not yet been held (see Rosicki, Rosicki & 
Assoc., P.C. v Cochems, 59 AD3d 512, 514 [2d Dept 2009]). 
Thus, since a motion for leave to amend a complaint should be freely granted, absent 
prejudice or surprise directly resulting from the delay in seeking leave, unless the proposed 
amendment is palpably insufficient or patently devoid of merit (see CPLR 3025 [b]; Aurora 
Loan Servs., LLC v Thomas, 70 AD3d 986, 987 [2d Dept 2010]; Lucido v Mancuso, 49 
AD3d 220, 222 [2d Dept 2008], appeal withdrawn 13 NY3d 813 [2009]), and, here, the 
proposed amendment was not palpably insufficient or patently devoid of merit and there
