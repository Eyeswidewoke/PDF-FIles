2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82496, * 
Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217, 221 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004). A document forms the basis of a claim 
when it is "integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint." Id. (citing In re Burlington 
Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997)). 
IV. Discussion 
Statebridge moves to dismiss Plaintiffs Complaint on the grounds that a) all of Plaintiffs 
claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine; b) Plaintiff cannot claim breach of contract 
because Statebridge was [-15] not a party to the contract, the contract authorized the 
actions alleged to be unlawful, and Plaintiff himself violated the contract; c) Plaintiff cannot 
claim breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, because Plaintiff has 
failed to allege that Statebridge deprived him of the benefit of his bargain or that 
Statebridge acted in bad faith; d) Plaintiff cannot claim breach of fiduciary duty, because 
no such duty exists between a mortgagor and mortgagee; e) Plaintiff cannot claim violation 
of the NJCFA, because Plaintiff has failed to allege that Statebridge engaged in an 
unlawful practice or that Plaintiff suffered an ascertainable loss; and f) Plaintiff cannot 
claim RICO violations, because Plaintiff has failed to allege a RICO enterprise or a pattern 
of racketeering activity. 
The Court considers each of these arguments in turn. 
A. The Filed Rate Doctrine 
Statebridge first argues that all of Plaintiffs claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine, 
which "provides that a rate filed with and approved by a governing regulatory agency is 
unassailable in judicial proceedings brought by ratepayers." Clark v. Prudential Ins. Co. of 
Am., 736 F. Supp. 2d 902, 913 (D.N.J. 2010) (citing Alston v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 585 
F.3d 753, 763 (3d Cir. 2009)). 
Specifically, "[t]he filed rate doctrine bars suits that challenge ['1 6] the reasonableness of 
filed rates or that would have the practical effect of causing certain consumers to pay a 
rate that varies from the filed and approved rate." (SMTD at 25 (citing Smith v. SBC 
Commc'ns, Inc., 178 N.J. 265, 274-75, 839 A.2d 850 (2004))) Statebridge argues that this 
non-justiciability strand deprives courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over such suits and 
"reflects the courts' general reluctance to substitute their judgment for the judgment of the 
regulatory agency vested with primary authority to make such decisions and the courts' 
limited ability to determine the reasonableness of rates." (Id. at 26 (quoting Clark v. 
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 736 F. Supp. 2d 902, 913 (D.N.J. 2010)). 
However, the filed rate doctrine does not apply to bar claims where "Plaintiffs challenge 
[Defendant's] allegedly wrongful conduct, not the reasonableness or propriety of the rate 
that triggered that conduct." Alston v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 585 F.3d 753, 765 (3d Cir. 
2009). In Alston, the Third Circuit considered allegations of wrongful conduct involving 
unlawful kickbacks. "Plaintiffs may not sue . . . if they simply think that the price they paid 
for their settlement services was unfair," the Court found, but plaintiffs "may allege a 
violation of fair business practices through the use of illegal kickback payments. The filed-
rate doctrine bars suit from the former class of plaintiffs r17] and not the latter." Id. at 764 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
