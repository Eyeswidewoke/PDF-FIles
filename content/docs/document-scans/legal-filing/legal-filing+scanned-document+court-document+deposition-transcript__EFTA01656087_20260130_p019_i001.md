• Brooking Institution: The future of US climate  policy: Issues at stake in the 2024 election — Thursday, 
September 19, 2024. Location: Brooking Institution, 3:00 PM. Climate policy has been a significant focal area 
at the federal level over the past three years, notably with the passage of legislation such as the Inflation 
Reduction Act (IRA) and the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The IRA and IIJA will be 
essential for the transition of the United States to a carbon-free society by 2050. They will also have wide-
reaching state and local impacts, including in Michigan. The 2024 election is an ideal time to examine how 
current U.S. climate policy is working and what the next few years could look like. For instance, many 
challenges remain in the implementation of the IRA and the IIJA (e.g., permitting and land use), while the 
impacts on major industries like automotive manufacturing are still being studied. On September 19, 
Brookings and the University of Michigan will bring together their policy and research expertise to explore 
important aspects of recent legislation as well as the future of climate policy in the United States. Please join 
us for a reception following the program.

• CSIS: "On Day One": A U.S. Economic Contingency Plan for a Taiwan Crisis — Thursday, September 19, 2024. 
Location: Online event, 11:30 AM. How should the U.S. respond economically on "day one" of a significant 
crisis in or around the Taiwan Strait? How swiftly and dramatically would U.S. economic decisions ripple out 
globally? To answer these and related questions, the Freeman Chair is pleased to host a discussion with Eyck 
Freymann, a Hoover Fellow at Stanford University and non-resident research fellow at the China Maritime 
Studies Institute at the US Naval War College, and Hugo Bromley, Research Associate at the Centre for 
Geopolitics and an affiliated research associate at Robinson College, Cambridge. They are authors of the 
recent report On Day One: An Economic Contingency Plan for a Taiwan Crisis (Hoover Institution Press, July 
2024), which lays out guiding recommendations for "avalanche decoupling" in the case of a Taiwan Strait 
crisis. Jude Blanchette, Freeman Chair in China Studies, will moderate the discussion. 
• CSIS: The Implications of GSP Renewal for Great Power Competition —Thursday, September 19, 2024. 
Location: Online event, 2:00PM. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, which provides duty-
free treatment to goods from designated beneficiary countries, lapsed in 2020. Despite ongoing discussions 
about its importance, it has yet to be reauthorized, leading to continued uncertainty for beneficiary 
countries and the businesses that rely on this program. The lapse of GSP is part of a broader collapse in U.S. 
trade policy over the last 15 years. Free trade agreements, once a cornerstone of U.S. economic policy, have 
become politically contentious. However, the cessation of GSP comes at a time when China has become the 
leading trading partner for many developing countries. The lack of an American alternative offer is 
accelerating deeper economic ties between these countries and China, with long-term geopolitical 
implications. This panel will examine the strengths and weaknesses of the potential reauthorization of GSP 
and how the U.S. can reassert leadership in global trade, support economic growth in the developing world, 
and counter China's growing global influence.
