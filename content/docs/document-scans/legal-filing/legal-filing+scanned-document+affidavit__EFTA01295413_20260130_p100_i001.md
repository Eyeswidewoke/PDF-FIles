the terms and provisions of the Lease are hereby ratified, reaffirmed and confirmed." 
(Emphasis added.) 
We find that, contrary to the Swentos' argument, none of these changes rin in the 
Agreement constituted a material change in terms so as to release the Swentos from their 
personal guaranty. None of these clauses altered the performance required by the tenant, 
such as the amount of rent owed under the lease, the terms of lease, or the basic 
relationship between the tenant and landlord. In addition, the waiver of any defenses 
against the landlord was only as of the date of the Agreement. 
The Swentos, nonetheless, argue that their obligation under the personal guaranty was 
discharged by the assignment of the tenant's obligations under the lease to successor 
tenants and ultimately Jeepers Illinois. The Swentos assert that when they transferred the 
Jeepers franchise back to Jeepers Illinois and assigned all assets and liabilities to Jeepers 
Illinois, the asset pool available to the business creditors of the tenant significantly 
changed. The Swentos maintain that on March 25, 1998, when Jeepers and Jeepers 
Illinois dissolved Family Fun, which was the Swentos' family business operating the 
franchise, the Swentos' amount of risk changed because the Swentos were no longer 
guarantying that the entity they exercised direct control over would satisfy the lease 
agreement. rug The Swentos rely on Bernardi Bros., Inc. v. Great Lakes Distributing, 
Inc., 712 F.2d 1205 (7th Cir. 1983), in support of their argument. 
In Bernardi Bros., the owner of a car wash took out a bank loan and had it guaranteed. 
The borrower later incorporated his business and changed its name, but the pool of assets 
that secured the loan remained the same. The guarantor later sought to escape liability 
due to the incorporation and name change. The court applied Illinois law and held that 
because the economic relationship between the parties had not changed, the incorporation 
and name change did not materially alter the contract and did not discharge the loan. 
Bernardi Bros., 712 F.2d at 1207-08. Here, the Swentos argue that following the reasoning 
Bernardi Bros., where a change in corporate form does diminish the pool of assets 
available to its creditors, the risk ['•138] posed to the guarantors is necessarily increased 
and justified the discharge of the guarantors' obligations. The Swentos maintain that when 
the debtor changed from being the Swentos themselves, to their franchisor, Jeepers, the 
pool of assets changed and the risk to the Swentos as guarantors substantially increased. 
However, the [un] Swentos agreed to the assignment of the tenant's interests to 
Jeepers Illinois. This assignment was expressly recognized by the "Fourth Amendment to 
['6O9] Lease." The fourth amendment, which was signed by both Harvey and Cherry 
Swento, also contained a statement that the Swentos: "ratify, reaffirm and confirm their 
joint and several obligations under and pursuant to that certain Personal Guaranty of 
Lease dates as of July 8, 1991, in favor of the Landlord." The record therefore indicates 
that the Swentos agreed to guaranty the obligations of Jeepers Illinois as assignee of the 
lease. Where guarantors assent to such changes in the contract, the guarantors will not be 
released. See Roels, 240 III. App. 3d at 583. 
We further find that the Swentos' arguments ignore the fact that the language of the 
personal guaranty specifically provided that the guaranty would remain intact regardless of 
changes and modifications to the lease, including extensions of the lease. The personal 
guaranty provided:
