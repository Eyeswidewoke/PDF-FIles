Our Company 
While we will be internally managed upon completion of this offering, we have previously been an 
externally managed real estate company. We focus primarily on the acquisition of a diversified portfolio 
of permanent crop, specialty/vegetable row crop and commodity row crop farmland, including 
development farmland located in the U.S. in select major agricultural states. We lease our farms to 
experienced professional farmer tenants under a variety of lease structures with staggered durations, 
including fixed leases and participating leases. As of June 30, 2015, our portfolio was comprised of 
17 farms with approximately 15,378 gross acres, including nine farms in California, three farms in 
Florida, three farms in Illinois, one property in Arkansas and one property consisting of two aggregated 
parcels, one of which is in Alabama and the other of which is in Georgia. Subsequent to June 30, 2015, 
we have acquired two additional properties (one of which was aggregated with an existing farm). 
increasing our total portfolio to approximately 16,136 gross acres with a value of approximately 
$207.7 million, holding the two recent acquisitions at cost. For a more detailed discussion of our farms, 
see "Our Business and Farms—Our Portfolio." 
We were formed as a Maryland corporation in October 2009, and we have elected to qualify as a 
real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our 
taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We conduct all of our business activities through our operating 
partnership, of which we will be the sole general partner following the Internalization. 
Internalization 
Since commencing operations in October 2009, we have been externally managed by AM, which is 
an affiliate of Optima. On November 25, 2014, we and our operating partnership entered into a 
Contribution Agreement with AFT1RS and each of the holders of equity ownership interests in AM 
pursuant to which, upon the completion of this offering, we will internalize the management functions 
historically provided by AFA. As consideration in the Internalization. our operating partnership will 
issue Common Units with an aggregate value of $12 million to AFTRS and each of the holders of 
equity ownership interests in AFA. On December 15. 2014, we received the requisite consent from a 
majority of our disinterested stockholders approving the Internalization. We expect that the 
Internalization will be completed simultaneously with, and conditioned upon, the completion of this 
offering. See "Structure of Our Company—Internalization." 
We expect that, after the Internalization, our management team will be comprised of the current 
employees of our company as well as shared employees with Optima pursuant to an arrangement 
described below. See "Certain Relationships and Related Party Ransactions—lkansitional Services
