Global Equities 
While good U.S. economic data is normally positive for 
the Eurostoxx, the impact of lower U.S. inflation or 
wage growth data on Europe is less known. 
But if you assumed this worked against Fed rate 
hikes, then it could move EUR/USD up again in the 
short term — often not a positive for the Eurostoxx. 
A fading tailwind from a weak EUR would have an 
impact on Eurozone companies, particularly on 2016 
earnings. Equity investors are already focusing on 
next year, so this could affect current levels. 
The good news is that ECB knows all this and should 
include the EUR as a factor in any decision to expand 
or prolong its quantitative easing (QE) program, if 
Eurozone economic data should deteriorate. 
The earnings exposure of the Eurostoxx to China is 
about 15-20% with the German market being the most 
exposed. So downward revisions to earnings per 
share (EPS) estimates would not surprise. 
Lower valuations will, of course, price in negative 
news from China to some extent. But the impact of 
China on other emerging markets could create further 
problems — and not only for European markets. 
Global Fixed Income 
— Eurozone GDP growth picked up to +1.5% YoY in Q2 
2015, up from around +0.75% a year ago. 
— Normally, such an improvement in growth would have 
been expected to push government bond yields higher. 
— However, Eurozone bond yields currently look more 
influenced by the disinflation impulse coming from 
China and commodities. It looks as though worries 
about inflation trump growth, so far this year. 
— The quantitative easing (i.e. bond buying) program by 
the ECB has also increased demand and thus the 
prices of government bonds, thereby reducing yields, 
mainly in the first quarter of this year. 
— The chart shows the currently close correlation 
between government bond yields in the Eurozone 
(proxied for by the French 10 year yield) and inflation. 
— Should the disinflation impulse from China/ 
commodities get more obvious, as the ECB hinted at in 
its last press conference, a further fall in inflation 
cannot be ruled out. The latest inflation release showed 
consumer prices falling by -0.1% YoY in September 
after +0.2% the month before.

Focus of the week 
Equities: Any ECB decision on QE expansion or 
prolongation will likely factor in the implications of 
the EUR exchange rate for Eurozone equities. 
Fixed Income: Eurozone bond yields remain more 
influenced by disinflation concerns than evidence 
that economic growth is picking up.
