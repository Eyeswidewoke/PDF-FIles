Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges:We use the Average Daily 
balance methodto calculate Finance Charges on your Account. Under thismethod,we figure the Finance Charges on your 
Account by applying the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for eadi feature (such as 
Purchase,. Cash Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account(Inducting current transactions). To get the 
Average Daily Balance for each feature, we ° C ake the beginning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid 
Fi nance Charges from previous billing periods), 2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees (3) subtract any paymentscc 
credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustmen . For each day after the first day of rho billing period, we also 
add an amount of interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the daily periodic rate 
for the feeure. This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for 
ihO next day. If this balance is negative, d is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the 
feature for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average 
Daily Balance for the feature. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number of days in the billing 
period and the daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the Finance Charge assessed on that feature, except for 
variations caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge for the billing period is calculated by adding the Finance Charges 
assessed on all features of the Account. This 
method of cakulating the Average Daily Balance 
and 
Finance Charge results in daily compounding of Finance Charges. The minimum Finance Charge for any 
billing period in which Finance Charges are imposedis $0.50. If you paid the New Balance on your prior statement in ILA 
by its payment due date, and you pay the New Balance on this statement by its payment due date, then you 
will avoid additional Finance Charges on purchases inducted in the New Balance ai this statement. 
Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies: if you incur a Charge in a foreign currency, it will be 
converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date. 
Currently, the conversion rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest 
official 'a:inversion rate published by a government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate 
identified by us from customary banking sources, on the conversion date or the prior business day, 
in each 
instance increased 
by 
2%. This conversion rate may, doer from rates in effect on the 
date of your Charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such 
estabishments use.
