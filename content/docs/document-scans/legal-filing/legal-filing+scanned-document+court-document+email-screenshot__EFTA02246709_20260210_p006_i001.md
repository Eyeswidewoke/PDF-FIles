Rail Protection Plan TM
General Conditions for an Exchange under the Rail 
Protection Plan TM
• Rail passes, train tickets, reservations, and city passes/tours may be exchanged for the 
same or different product(s), excluding Gift Cards. 
• The value of the original product will be applied to the new booking. Travelers who have 
not yet determined their new travel date(s), or if tickets are not available yet for purchase, 
will be issued a coupon code equal to the value of the exchanged product(s) to be applied to 
a new booking at a later date. 
• Travelers are responsible to pay the difference in price between the exchanged product(s) 
and the new booking. If the price of the product is lower than the original product, the 
difference will not be refunded nor will a credit/coupon code be given for future use. 
• Coupon Codes are issued in the name of the traveler(s) given at the time of the original 
booking and are non-transferable. 
• Coupon Codes issued for an exchanged product must be redeemed on a new booking no 
later than two (2) years from the issue date on the coupon code. No refund will be issued in 
cases where the full value of the coupon code is not used. 
• No explanation is required for exchange requests on the product(s). 
• Rail Protection Plan has no cash value. Travelers who use their RPP Exchange benefit 
and then cancel the new booking will only be eligible to receive a refund on any cost paid by 
the traveler that exceeded the value of the original exchange after the penalties have been 
applied. Shipping and handling fees are non-refundable. 
• Exchange of Paper Products under RPP : Exchange requests must be received by 
RENA Customer Relations no later than three (3) business days prior to the scheduled 
departure date to Europe. New product/coupons codes will not be issued until the original 
documents have been received by RENA. Exchanges on paper products cannot be 
performed after the traveler(s) have departed to Europe. Travelers with paper products 
leaving for Europe within 3 business days or who are shipping paper products internationally 
to Europe, are not eligible to take advantage of the RPP Exchange benefit but may still 
qualify for the RPP Cancellation Benefit. 
• Exchange of E-tickets (Print at Station/Print at Home) under RPP : Exchange requests 
must be received by RENA no later than three (3) business days prior to the scheduled train 
departure date. Exchange requests received two (2) business days or less from the
