S-1/A 
Purchasers in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the book value of their investment. 
The assumed initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set 
forth on the cover page of this prospectus, is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our 
outstanding capital stock upon the completion of this offering. Therefore, if you purchase shares of our Class A common stock in 
this offering, you will incur immediate dilution of $10.64 in the net tangible book value per share from the price you paid. In 
addition, investors purchasing shares of our Class A common stock from us in this offering will have contributed 29.8% of the total 
consideration paid to us by all stockholders who purchased shares of our common stock, in exchange for acquiring approximately 
8.4% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of September 30. 2015, after giving effect to this offering. The 
exercise of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock will result in further dilution. 
In making your investment decision, you should understand that we and the underwriters have not authorized any other 
party to provide you with information concerning us or this offering. 
You should carefully evaluate all of the information in this prospectus. We have in the past received, and may continue to 
receive, a high degree of media coverage, including coverage that is not directly attributable to statements made by our officers or 
employees, that incorrectly reports on statements made by our officers or employees, or that is misleading. We and the 
underwriters have not authorized any other party to provide you with information concerning us or this offering. 
Affiliates of one of the underwriters in this offering collectively beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding 
convertible preferred stock and have an interest in this offering beyond customary underwriting discounts and 
commissions. 
Because J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is an underwriter in this offering and its affiliates collectively beneficially own more than 
10% of our outstanding convertible preferred stock, all of which will convert into shares of Class B common stock in connection with 
this offering, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is deemed to have a "conflict of interest" under Rule 5121 of Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority Inc. (Rule 5121). Accordingly, this offering will be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of Rule 5121. The 
rule requires that a "qualified independent underwriter" meeting certain standards participate in the preparation of the registration 
statement and prospectus and exercise the usual standards of due diligence with respect thereto. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC has 
agreed to act as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 5121 in connection with this offering. Morgan 
Stanley & Co. LLC will not receive any additional fees for serving as a qualified independent underwriter in connection with this 
offering. In its role as qualified independent underwriter, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC has participated in due diligence and the 
preparation of this prospectus and the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Although Morgan Stanley & Co. 
LLC has, in its capacity as qualified independent underwriter, participated in due diligence and the preparation of this prospectus 
and the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we cannot assure you that this will adequately address all 
potential conflicts of interest. We have agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC against liabilities incurred in connection with 
acting as qualified independent underwriter, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In accordance with Rule 5121, J.P. 
Morgan Securities LLC will not sell shares of our Class A common stock to a discretionary account without the prior written 
approval from the account holder. See the section titled "Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest)" for additional information.
