Yet the crisis mean= even more because it was the birth of the modern era of energy. Although =he OPEC embargo 
seemed to provide proof that the world was running short o= oil resources, the move by Arab exporters did the 
opposite: It provided massive incentive to develop new oil fields =utside of the Middle East—what became known as 
"non-OPEC," led=by drilling in the North Sea and Alaska. 
The Prudhoe Bay oil=field was discovered in Alaska five years before the crisis. Yet oppositio= by environmentalists had 
prevented approval for a pipeline to bring the 0=1 down from the North Slope—very much a "prequel" to the current 
battle over the Keystone XL pipeline.=Only in the immediate aftermath of the embargo did a shaken Congress appro=e a 
pipeline that eventually added at its peak as much as two million barr=ls a day to the domestic supply. 
The push to find al=ernatives to oil boosted nuclear power and coal as secure domestic sources=of electric power. The 
1973 crisis spawned the modern wind and solar indus=ries, too. By 1975, 5,000 people were flooding into Washington, 
D.C., for a conference on solar energy, which ha= been until then only "a subject for eco-freaks," as one writer =oted at 
the time. 
That same year, Con=ress passed the first Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which requ=red auto makers to 
double fuel efficiency—from 13.5 miles per gallon to =7 miles per gallon—ultimately saving about two millions barrels of 
oil per day. (The standards were raised in 2=12 to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025). France launched a "war on energ= 
waste," and Japan, short of resources and fearing that its economic =iracle was at risk, began a drive for energy 
efficiency. Despite enormous growth in the U.S. economy since 1973, oil co=sumption today is up less than 7%. 
The crisis also set=the stage for the emergence of new importers that have growing weight in t=e global oil market. In 
1973, most oil was consumed in the developed econo=ies of North America, Western Europe and Japan—two thirds as 
late as 2000. But now oil consumption is flat or=falling in those economies, and virtually all growth in demand is in 
devel=ping economies, now better known as "emerging markets." They rep=esent half of world oil consumption today, 
and their share will continue to increase. Exporting countries will increa=ingly reorient themselves to those markets. Last 
month, China overtook the=U.S. as the world's largest net importer of oil. 
A lasting lesson of=the crisis years is the power of markets and their ability to adjust to di=ruptions, if government allows 
them to. The iconic images of the 1970s—g=s lines and angry motorists—are trotted out whenever some new disruption 
happens. Yet those gas lines weren't the =esult of markets. They were the largely self-inflicted result of governmen= 
interference in markets with price controls and supply allocation. Today,=the oil market is much more transparent owing 
to the development of futures markets. 
The 1970s were also=years of natural-gas shortages, which turned into a bitter political issue= particularly within the 
Democratic Party. Many at the time attributed the=e shortages to geology, but they too were the result of regulation 
and price controls. What solved the shortage= wasn't more controls but their elimination, which resulted in an 
oversupp=y that became known as the "gas bubble." Today, abundant natural=gas is the default fuel for new electricity 
generation. The lesson is that markets and price signals can work very eff=ciently, and surprisingly swiftly, even in crises, 
if they are allowed to.=/span> 
There will be futur= energy disruptions because there is still much political risk around oil.=ln 2013, the Middle East is 
still in turmoil, but the alignments are diffe=ent. In 1973, Iran was one of America's strongest allies in the Middle East. 
Tehran didn't participate in the emba=go and pushed oil into the market. But since the 1979 Islamic revolution, 
=ashington and Tehran have been adversaries. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which=was at the center of the 1973 embargo, 
is now America's strongest Arab ally. 
The real lesson of =he shock of 1973 and the second oil shock set off by the overthrow of Iran=s shah in 1979 is that they 
provided incentives—and imperatives—to dev=lop new resources. Today, total world oil production is 50% greater than 
in 1973. Exploration in the North Sea and A=aska was only the beginning. In the early 1990s, offshore production 
expan=ed farther out into the Gulf of Mexico, opening up deep water as a new oil=frontier. In the late 1990s, Canadian 
oil sands embarked on an era of growth that today makes them a larger sour=e of oil than Libya before its 2011 civil war.
