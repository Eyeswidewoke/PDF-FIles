end of the match-making, possibly with Triquint, and certainly outside of this deal, with 
other players attempting to redefine their own positions. It will be interesting to watch 
Skyworks, which has a healthy handset business in the active elements, but is doing 
well growing their business in other areas, outside of the handset market. 
There is a lot at stake in the front-end, we estimate the total 3G/LTE FEM addressable 
market to be a 57.6 to $11.5 billion annual opportunity in FY15. And while we did not 
hear much interest out of the merchant baseband vendors not-named-Qualcomm (they 
are likely focused on launching LTE before they attempt integration elsewhere), many 
front-end players were likely looking around at possibilities to strengthen their position 
or sell while the selling is good. Some have made great strides in recent years - we met 
with Ethertronics, who continues to do well and is making similar moves to integrate 
front-end elements into their antennaes. I/O Semiconductor is another player with 
whom we met and is sounding encouraged by recent design wins. Altogether, there 
appear to be a number of players receiving decent amounts of business. Our thesis 
though remains the same - consolidation will continue and many will be best served to 
find a dance partner sooner rather than later. 
Peregrine - PA catches attention of many 
At the show, Peregrine demoed their CMOS PA, and the results were impressive - the 
company was able achieve 44% efficiency in LTE used alongside Nuilira's envelope 
tracking solution - being at least as good, if not better than the best GaAs competitor. 
With WCMDA, the solution achieves 48% efficiency without envelope tracking, in line 
with the best GaAs competitor. Many hardware vendors are impressed with the demo 
results, and while RFMD has made inroads into Peregrine's territory recently, we 
believe that Peregrine should be able to secure design wins with this PA solution given 
its efficiency and size. While the existing switch business continues to bump along with 
Samsung being their main customer, adding PA revenues could be hugely helpful not 
just to the top•line, but also to the company's appeal as a target for others. Meanwhile 
the high performance business segment continues to perform well, with automotive 
and set-top players both helping to drive profitable growth for the business. Overall, 
management sounded encouraged about the results of their PA. We believe this is 
certainly a step in the right direction but our excitement is tempered by the view that 
something may need to be done, possibly inorganically, in order to expedite their 
roadmap to a fully integrated solution for the front end.

SCIISIMO MOH: 
In our meeting with management, they sounded constructive about growth with 
Chinese-based OEMs and their traction in adjacent markets. They also sounded upbeat 
about their recent announcement around motion technology, called Motion 
technology, which enables activity navigation and gesture interpretation while 
consuming low energy (less than 5mW). The company feels that there are a number of 
use cases around the technology and while we tend to agree, we also wonder how 
quickly Qualcomm would be able to integrate such a technology into their own chipset. 
Nonetheless, the technology on its own was interesting, but is still in its early stages. 
Management appeared positive, encouraged by recent, more constructive discussions 
with Apple than in years past; however nothing was announced, nor did they expect it 
to be any time soon. Management simply made the point to suggest that relations were 
no longer at a standstill. To us this means taking the value of zero opportunities with 
one of the largest handset OEMs in the world to a chance, incorporating a small option 
value to the name. We would counter any positive notions about this, with the point 
that the company could find it challenging to backfill the waning Apple royalty stream 
with profitable sales as we move throughout the year. As a result, we maintain our 
Hold.
