2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79534, * 
the transfers at issue in that ease were made directly from Jeffrey Prosser's company to 
his wife for fair value and without fraud, so too Prosser could have argued — "at any time" 
during the course of the trial, and certainly once all the evidence had been submitted [' 6] 
to the jury -- that Carroll failed to present evidence showing Jeffrey Prosser owned the 
assets he transferred to his wife, and failed to present evidence showing Jeffrey Prosser's 
insolvency at the time of each transfer. There is no reason why Prosser had to wait for the 
jury verdict in the parallel case before raising either of those arguments. 
Even if this Court were to find Prosser's arguments not waived, however, the motion is 
denied as a matter of law. Upon review of the evidence submitted to the jury, this Court 
finds Trustee Carroll submitted sufficient evidence regarding Jeffrey Prosser's ownership 
of the assets he fraudulently transferred to his wife to support the verdict in this case. In 
addition, the Court finds Jeffrey Prosser's insolvency at the time of each transfer is not an 
essential element of Trustee Carroll's claims. 
Trustee Carroll presented Alan Barbree, a forensic accounting expert, to testify about 
Jeffrey Prosser's ownership of each of the five categories of assets Carroll sought to 
recover in his case: (1) cash; (2) jewelry: (3) improvements to the Shoys Estate; (4) 
furniture; and (5) fine art and antiques. As to the first two categories, Barbee testified that 
r7] Jeffrey Prosset transferred cash and jewelry to his wife via payments made directly 
from his personal bank account. Trial Tr. 118:3-120:7, 12.1:7-124:19,125:2-15,129: 8-
130:23,132:2-17,135:11-136:5,136:18-141:16,141:20-142:11, June 7, 2011. These 
transfers were explained in detail at trial, and supporting documentation was included With 
Barbree's summary of the transfers, all of which was provided to the jury during its 
deliberations so it could track the payments. Based on this evidence, the jury could 
reasonably have concluded Jeffrey Prosser's personal bank account was the point of 
origin for the cash and jewelry transferred. See id.; see also Trial Exs. 201 - 203, 216. 
Barbree further testified that the remaining three categories of assets Trustee Carroll 
sought to recover (improvements to the Shoys mansion, furniture, and art and antiques) 
were paid for either through Jeffrey Prosser's personal bank account or through a "contra-
equity account" set up at Jeffrey Prosser's company for his use. Trial Tr. 143:17-24, 
144:20-145:8, 147:3-161:22, June 7, 2011. As stipulated by the parties, payments made 
through this contra-equity account were "distributions" made solely for the benefit rsj of 
the shareholder, Jeffrey Prosser, and thus were Prosser's personal funds. Id. at 163. 
These transfers were also explained in detail at trial, and supporting documentation was 
again provided to the jury at the time of its deliberations so it could also track these 
payments. See Trial Exs. 213-215, 217. From this evidence alone, a jury could reasonably 
conclude the assets paid for through the contra-equity account, as distributions to Jeffrey 
Prosser, were owned by Jeffrey Prosser, and were in fact transfers from Jeffrey Prosser to 
his wife. Moreover, Prosser herself tetified these items were gifts from her husband, 
providing further evidence of her husband's initial ownership. See, e.g., Trial Tr. 224:6-25 
(jewelry), June 7, 2011. As a result, this Court finds Trustee Carroll presented sufficient 
evidence for a jury to conclude Jeffrey Prosser owned the particular assets at issue which 
he men fraudulently transferred to his wife. 
Prosser next argues Trustee Carroll failed to present evidence of Jeffrey Prosser's 
insolvency at the time of each transfer, which Prosser contends was an essential element 
of each of Carroll's claims. Trustee Carroll asserted three types of claims against [' 9]
