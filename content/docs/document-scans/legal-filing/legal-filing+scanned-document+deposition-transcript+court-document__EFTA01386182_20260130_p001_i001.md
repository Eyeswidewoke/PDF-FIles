AGP LP 519 Alpha Group Capital Paul Barrett 
2. INTRODUCTION 
Alkeon Growth PW Partners, LP is a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership") formed for 
the purpose of investing its assets in accordance with the investment objective set forth in this Confidential 
Private Offering Memorandum (the 'Memorandum") and the Partnership's Limited Partnership Agreement 
(the Partnership Agreement"), each as may be amended from time to time. The Partnership invests in a 
broad range of financial instruments and other investments. Alkeon Capital Advisers, LLC, a Delaware 
limited liability company, is the general partner of the Partnership (the "General Partner') and is responsible 
for managing the business of the Partnership. Alkeon Capital Management, LLC, a Delaware limited 
liability company that is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the "SEC"), is the investment manager (the -Investment Manager") of the Partnership. Panayotis ("Takis") 
Sparaggis, the controlling person and Chief Investment Officer of the Investment Manager and the 
controlling person of the General Partner, serves as the Partnership's principal portfolio manager (the 
"Portfolio Manager) and as the lead member of the Investment Manager's investment team. Other 
members of the investment team assist Mr. Sparaggis in his role as the Partnership's Portfolio Manager. 
The Partnership invests substantially all of its assets through a "master-feeder" fund structure in 
Alkeon Growth Master Fund, Ltd. (the "Master Fund"), a Cayman Islands exempted company. Alkeon 
Growth Offshore Fund, Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (the "Offshore Feeder), and other 
investment vehicles also invest their assets in the Master Fund and other investment vehicles may be 
formed in the future to invest in the Master Fund. Each investment vehicle, including the Partnership, that 
invests in the Master Fund indirectly shares the expenses of the Master Fund pro rata based on its interest 
in the Master Fund. The Investment Manager also serves as the investment manager to the Master Fund 
and the Offshore Feeder. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Memorandum to the investment 
activities of the Partnership mean the investment activities of the Partnership indirectly through its 
investment in the Master Fund, and other references to the Partnership may, to the extent appropriate, 
include both the Partnership and the Master Fund. 
This Memorandum sets forth the investment objective and method of operation of the Partnership, 
the principal terms of the Partnership Agreement and certain other pertinent information. However, this 
Memorandum does not set forth all the provisions and distinctions of the Partnership Agreement that may 
be significant to a particular prospective limited partner of the Partnership (each, a "Limited Partner; 
collectively, the "Limited Partners"; and, together with the General Partner, the "Partners"). 
Each 
prospective limited partner should examine this Memorandum, the Partnership Agreement and the 
Subscription Agreement accompanying this Memorandum in order to assure itself that the terms of the 
Partnership Agreement and the Partnership's investment objective and investment program are 
satisfactory to it. See Section 9, "Admission of Partners; Additional Capital Contributions." 
Prospective Limited Partners are invited to review any non-proprietary materials available to the 
General Partner relating to the Partnership, the operations of the Partnership and any other matters 
regarding this Memorandum. All such materials are available for review at the office of the Partnership at 
any reasonable hour after reasonable prior notice. The General Partner will afford prospective Limited 
Partners the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from its representatives concerning the 
terms and conditions of the offering and to obtain any additional information to the extent that the General 
Partner or the Partnership possesses such information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or 
expense.
