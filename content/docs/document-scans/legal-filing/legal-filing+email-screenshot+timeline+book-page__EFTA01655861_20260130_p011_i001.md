FBI Reinstates Security Clearance for Former Employee Who Raised Questions About Jan. 6 Attack 
CNN (06/05, McDougall) reported that former FBI employee Marcus Allen, who raised questions about the January 
6 Capitol attack, had his security clearance reinstated and was awarded 27 months of back pay after being 
suspended since February 2022. According to the article, the FBI had initially suspended Allen over concerns about 
his "allegiance to the United States" and his judgment regarding the events of January 6. After a congressional 
hearing and subsequent investigation, the FBI reinstated Allen's security clearance, leading to his resignation and 
his lawyer declaring the outcome a vindication. "While we can't comment on the specifics of any settlement, both 
parties agreed to resolve this matter without either admitting wrongdoing. Any allegation that the Director lied to 
Congress is false. The FBI takes seriously its responsibility to FBI employees who make protected disclosures under 
whistleblower regulations, and we are committed to ensuring they are protected from retaliation," the FBI said.
