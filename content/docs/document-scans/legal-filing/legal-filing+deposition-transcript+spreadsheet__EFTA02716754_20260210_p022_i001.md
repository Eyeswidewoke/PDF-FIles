respectively. Yet, Little Rock's crime rate has imp=oved slightly since 2010, when when more than 1,500 violent crimes 
were reported=for every 100,000 people. Prison overcrowding remains a major issue for Pulaski County, which includes 
little Rock. Police have claimed that preventing rep=at offenders from being detained for long enough periods of time 
may be exacerbating the local crime problem.

Low educational attainment and poverty rates among Cleveland residents may explain, in part= the area's high violent 
crime rate. Just 78.2% of area adults had c=mpleted high school and 16.5% had at least a bachelor's degree as of last 
y=ar, both among the lower figures nationwide. Also, Cleveland's median househ=ld income of $26,096 was lower than 
that of every other large U.S. city except for Detroit. Robberies accounted for the bulk of Cleveland's violent cr=me rate, 
with 897 reported per 100,000 last year, second only to Oakland. The burgla=y rate was even higher. More than 2,100 
burglaries — thefts occurring=without the victim present — were documented per 100,000 area residents last ye=r, the 
second highest rate in the country and more than three times the national r=te of 610.

More than 5,000 violent crime were reported in St. Louis last year, or nearly 1,600 per 100=000 people. Still, much like 
the rest of the nation, violent crime in St. Louis=has dropped in recent years. In 2010, more than 6,200 violent incidents 
were re=orted in the city, or 1,747 per 100,000 residents. Despite this improvement, St. Louis still struggles with tragic 
levels of certain serious crimes. A total=of 120 murders were reported in St. Louis last year, or 38 per 100,000 people, 
among the worst rates for any large U.S. city. Additionally, according to l=cal news reports, there were considerably 
more murders this year through Octobe= than during the same period in 2013. 
3. Memphis,=Tenn.

> Pct. of adults with high school degree: 82.5% (82nd lowest) 
There were 7,200 aggravated assaults reported in Memphis last year. This was one of the larg=st figures among U.S. 
cities and a major contributor to Memphis' high =iolent crime rate of 1,656 per 100,000 residents. In addition to a high 
violent cr=me rate, Memphis also suffers from high levels of property crimes, which total=ed nearly 40,000. There were 
366 arsons in 2013, for example, more than in all=but five other large U.S. cities. Like residents in a majority of the 
country=E2440s most dangerous cities, Memphis residents are far more likely to live in pov=rty than most Americans. 
The area's poverty rate of nearly 28% in 2013 =as among the highest rates nationwide.
