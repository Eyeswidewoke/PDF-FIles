=C2 With regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong 
inclination is not to be=20 involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught w=th many pitfall many that 
will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. =AO I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people 
involved need to =e upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the begi=ing of my involvement ) I am 
also aware however of my overar=hing friendship obligations of ok, -given all the complexities =who else can do it? 
problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. child=en with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking with little 
direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would report to him. 
eilee= included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot=C2 my first choice as I prefer only being 
responsible and standing behind =y own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be transmi=ted to reflect 
status stated by others ) 
=With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to think 
through the problem creatively=. My organizations handling of the more complex isssues I believe you might find very 
costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing,=maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my teams 
doing the work , not your=. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator. not sure what role you prefer for=Eileen as 
you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Ric= your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom 
report to a =ew person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy gregory, I wo=ld suggest limiting to one person. The 
increasing public profile needs to be tak=n into consideration. 
talk later..
