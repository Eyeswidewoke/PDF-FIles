"We are not interested in the fate =f certain individuals," Mr. Lavrov said at a late night news conference 
<httpl=www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2013/05/209117.htm> on Tuesday. "We are interested in the fate=of the 
Syrian people." 
Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Kerry announced th=t they would host an international conference where Syrian government 
officials and rebels will be given a chance to name an i=terim government 
<http:=/www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/07/us-syria-crisis-conference-idUSBRE9461=S20130507> . The odds of the 
two sides agreeing are low but Mr. Kerry d=serves credit for securing a small diplomatic step forward here. 
The problem is that Mr. Lavrov =nd his boss, President Vladimir Putin, may be unable to deliver on Mr. Ass=d. 
For nearly two years, Mr. lavro= and Mr. Putin have served as the Syrian leaders' chief diplomatic allie= but Iran has 
provided far more military support. Russian analysts say Washington is kidding itself if it believes Mr. Putin=can 
orchestrate a quick and easy Assad exit. 
"All of this is wishful think=ng," said Sergei Strokan, a columnist for the liberal Moscow daily Komme=sant. "Moscow has 
quite limited influence on the Syrian regime." 
Decades from now, President Bar=ck Obama's decision to not arm Syria's rebels may be condemned or prai=ed. But a 
visit to Moscow this week showed that it has come at an immediate price. Washington's failure to act created a=vacuum 
that Mr. Putin and Mr. Lavrov used to boost Russia's global stand=ng. 
"For the last two years, Lavrov has=dramatically elevated his profile on the world stage," Susan Glasser rec=ntly wrote in 
Foreign Policy magazine. "He has done so by almost singl=-handedly defying Western attempts to force some united 
action <http://www.foreignpolicy.com/arti=les/2013/04/29/minister_no?page=full> to stop Syria's deadly civil war." 
Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Putin have a=so used Syria to bolster their standing at home. Mr. Kerry's widely publ=cized visit 
coincided with the one-year anniversary of disputed elections in Russia that led to Mr. Putin's third term in of=ice. 
Before meeting with Mr. Kerry, Mr. Putin fired a key lieutenant who w=s the architect of the system that has allowed the 
Russian leader to contr=l major industries, seize most media outlets and intimidate or co-opt rivals. 
With the price of oil low, Putin's =il-dependent economy is flagging. Barring a surge in prices, massive socia= welfare 
payments are unsustainable. <=ont face="Times New Roman">Corruption is endemic, consuming an estimated $300 
billion a year <http://www.blo=mberg.com/news/2013-05-07/strongman-putin-is-no-match-for-corruption.html> , 16 
percent of Russia's g=oss domestic product. Transparency International, an anti-corruption group= named Russia the 
worst nation on earth in its most recent Bribe Payer's index <http://bpi.transparency.org/bpi2=11/results/> , which 
ranks firms on their likelihood to bribe. 
A spate of recent laws on libel, prot=sts, blasphemy and treason has made it more difficult to exercise basic rights 
chttp://artic=es.washingtonpost.com/2013-04-17/world/38597570_1_russia-putin-alexander-c=erkasov> , the 
Washington Post reported last month.=Mr. Putin also recently ordered prosecutors nationwide to search for non-
g=vernmental organizations that have failed to abide by a new law requiring them to register as "foreign agen=s" if they 
receive foreign funding. 
Mr. Putin is probably secure un=il the end of his term in 2016. But a slowing economy and public fatigue w=th Mr. Putin 
are taking a toll. In the end, the key factor may be the price of oil, the pillar of Putin's one-dimens=onal economy. 
"If the price of oil drops below $50 [a barrel), it is a death sentence,=94 said a Russian analyst who asked not to be 
named.<=p> 
On the international stage, mea=while, Russia is ascendant. For Mr. Putin, Mr. Kerry's request for help =arked the 
achievement of a decade-old goal. From the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 1999 bombing of Kosovo, to=the 2003
