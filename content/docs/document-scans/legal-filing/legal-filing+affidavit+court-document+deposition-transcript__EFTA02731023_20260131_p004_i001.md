transactions, and why you were willing to pay Epstein over $100 million without a written 
services agreement or contract. 
Overpayments of income and other issues arising from trust tax avoidance scheme 
A central focus of the Committee's investigation is understanding what role Epstein 
played in solving an estate tax issue involving the 2006 GRATs. The Dechert report first 
described this issue as an estate tax "problem" that if left unresolved would lead to a potential 
estate tax liability for your children of $1 billion or more.12 The Dechert report also claimed that 
Epstein offered a "proprietary" solution that helped address this problem and allowed you to 
keep the assets in the 2006 GRATs outside of your taxable estate. In order to better understand 
this transaction, the Committee sent several requests for information related to tax issues arising 
from the 2006 GRATs, the assets held in the 2006 GRATs, and the solution Epstein proposed to 
ensure the assets would not be subject to gift and estate taxes. 
In response to the Committee's investigation, you indicated that there were no issues or 
problems with the 2006 GRATs themselves. Instead, you clarified that there was a tax-related 
concern with the remainder trust which the assets held in the 2006 GRATs were to be transferred 
into upon the expiration of the 2006 GRATs." It appears that because you were receiving 
income from assets held in the remainder trust, there was concern that the assets held in the trust 
would be included in your taxable estate.14 Under Internal Revenue Code Section 2036(a)(1), if a 
taxpayer gives away assets to a third party while retaining the right to income from those assets, 
those assets are included in the taxpayer's gross estate at the taxpayer's death. A related tax 
provision under Section 2035(a) provides that gifts of property made within three years of the 
donor's death would be included in the decedent's taxable estate.15

was a consensus among witnesses that Epstein offered a unique solution to a potential estate planning problem that 
arose out of a trust known as the 2006 Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (2006 GRAT)" and at pg. 10: "Witnesses 
differed on what the value of the estate tax would have been today or in the future if the issues had not been 
resolved, but they believed the estate tax liability could have been as much as $1 billion or more." 
11 Memorandum submitted on behalf of Leon Black by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP to Senator 
Ron Wyden, Chairman, Senate Finance Committee, Jan. 16, 2023 (at pgs. I & 2: "The memorandum respectfully 
proceeds on the belief that the premise of the question — that them were `issues with the 2006 GRAT' is based on a 
misunderstanding. Them were no issues or problems associated with the 2006 GRATs themselves. The 2006 
GRATs functioned as intended, and were in no way out of the ordinary for such instruments, nor were they 
problematic. Instead, there was a potential tax-related concern with the trust ('the remainder trust') into which the 
assets held in the 2006 GRATs were to be transferred into upon the expiration of the GRATs.") 
" Id. at pg. 2: "Under the terms of the remainder trust, the trustees were to distribute to Mr. Black income generated 
by certain specified assets. The trustees had a right to terminate Mr. Black's income interest. Under Internal 
Revenue Code Section 2036(a)(1), if a taxpayer gives away assets to a third party while retaining the right to income 
from those assets, those assets am included in the taxpayer's gross estate at the taxpayer's death." 
111d. at pg. 2: "A related estate tax issue involved Section 2035(a), which provides that if the decedent relinquished 
a power with respect to transferred property (which would include relinquishing an income interest of this nature) 
during the three-year period ending on his date of death, that property would also be included in his gross estate. 
Despite the fact that, as noted above, the trustees, rather than Mr. Black, would be terminating Mr. Black's income 
interest, and therefore Section 2035(a) would not be implicated, out of an abundance of caution, and given Mr. 
Black's age, all parties wanted to act promptly to resolve this issue (without a potential three-year tail)."
