The Whiteside. Lab 
606-064 
When I sought a position in the lab I contacted George by email and he replied by offering 
me a postdoc position that had just opened. George asked me to apply to the NIH for my own 
funding. I did so and asked him what areas he was interested in that I should consider writing 
a proposal on. He gave me a very broadly defined set of problems in the form of short phrases. 
For example, one was "mitochondria as reagents." And that was it. It was up to me to figure 
out what I wanted to work on and, at least, write a proposal. In the end, the proposal got 
funded by the NIH and luckily they haven't held me to that specific project: I've worked on 
everything but that project! 
When new recruits joined the lab, they were usually presented with a list of 5 to 10 projects 
Whitesides thought were important. They were also given a summary of each lab member's research, 
and asked to spend considerable time in the lab talking to researchers, who were also eager to get 
help with projects and thus tried to sell their "hottest ideas" to new recruits. Based on the list and 
others' ideas, new students had the opportunity to decide what to work on. Often, for the first six 
months, new members just talked to lab members and explored potential projects where they could 
make a contribution—usually working with different groups on different ideas. 
Team members were helpful to each other. They met regularly on formal and informal bases to 
discuss the status of their project, solve problems, and develop wild ideas. Nevertheless, Whitesides 
was adamant about results. A student needed to have three or four first-author papers, a few second-
author papers, and a few third-author papers. Thus, by the time he or she left the lab, a student 
usually had 10 or more published papers or submitted manuscripts. A student's doctoral thesis was 
literally a bound collection of all her or his published papers and manuscripts. Whitesides 
commented on this unconventional approach, "We staple them together and that's the thesis. We do 
not even change it. I've told the department that there is no way I can disentangle the contribution of 
an individual student from these highly collaborative projects. And also I do not intend to. Finally, 
they accepted this approach. It is very clear that it is the group that collectively generates the ideas 
and does the work. It is equally clear that the group collectively gets the credit." Whitesides went on 
to explain why the delicate problem of authorship was not a problem in his lab: 
The way we deal with senior authorship works out naturally and everybody understands 
it. Plus, groups are so productive that there's not really a problem with people having lots of 
opportunities to be first author. I'm always the last author. The first author is the person who 
takes the intellectual responsibility at the end by pulling the whole thing together, by doing 
most of the writing and by getting the organization done. And usually students are very good 
at recognizing who has been the engine for making the project go. At the beginning, new 
students are often supporting authors, but, by the time they leave, they are usually first 
authors. In the end, I think people very much like this notion of cooperation in research and 
the idea of research as a social as well as scientific activity. It is just fun to work with smart 
people on interesting problems! 
All the lab members generally shared Whitesides' view on authorship, considering it a "very 
generous policy" and a "very good system." Once a paper was written and submitted, the lead 
author provided documents to recipients on a checklist. A printout of the paper was sent to 
Harvard's Office of Trademark and Technology Licensing (OTTL). The official patent policy of the 
university stated that it was the responsibility of every member of a group who worked for the 
university to report his or her inventions to OTTL. The office was responsible for deciding whether it 
had commercial value. Whitesides was involved in the decision process as well. When he thought an 
idea had particular commercial relevance, he made sure it got the deserved attention. OTTL's Robert 
Benson commented:
