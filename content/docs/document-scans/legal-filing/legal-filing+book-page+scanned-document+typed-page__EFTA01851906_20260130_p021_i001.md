Fund Terms and Conditions 
The community foundation shall assume responsibility for 
check writing, bookkeeping, investment management, tax 
reporting, auditing and evaluation of projects, and for making 
available to the fund advisors and fund representatives 
reports of fund income, expenses and grantmaking, as 
appropriate. 
Restrictions on Grants 
In compliance with the Internal Revenue Code, grants are 
not permitted to individuals, for non-charitable purposes; 
for political contributions or to support political campaign 
activities; or for any purpose that would provide benefits, 
goods or services to a donor to the fund, the fund's 
advisor(s) or other related parties. A fund advisor is subject to 
IRS penalties if the fund's donor(s), advisor(s) or other related 
parties receive benefits, goods or services in connection 
with a grant recommendation. This includes grants to satisfy 
pledges made by any person including a fund advisor and 
non-deductible (or partially lax-deductible) memberships, 
event tickets, sponsorships, registration fees in tournaments 
and cause-related marketing activities. Grants are not 
allowed to private non-operating foundations. Please contact 
the community foundation if you have questions about the 
exclusion of benefits from grant recommendations and/or 
multiple-year payments. 
Payments from an Advised Fund 
The community foundation does not permit expense 
reimbursements, loans, compensation or other similar 
payments from an advised fund to any donor, fund advisor or 
related party. All expenses must be paid by the community 
foundation directly after appropriate review of the expenses 
and their payees, and all expenditures must be preapproved 
by the community foundation prior to being incurred. The 
expense submitted for review must be charitable in nature or 
support a charitable purpose. 
Fundraising Policy 
On rare occasions, the community foundation may consider 
permitting a fund to raise money. All fundraising activities 
must be pre-approved by the community foundation. Fund 
advisors must allow at least 30 days for approval. Use of the 
community foundation's name on any fundraising material 
is expressly prohibited without prior written approval by the 
community foundation. The community foundation cannot 
reimburse the donor, fund advisor or related parties for 
expenses related to fundraising activities. All contributions 
raised in support of the fund must be made payable to 
Silicon Valley Community Foundation with the name of the 
fund in the memo line. The community foundation is not 
responsible for the success of fundraising activities. 
Memorial Funds 
A memorial fund can be established in honor of someone 
who has passed away, and requests for donations in the 
name of the deceased to the community foundation are 
required to use the following language in obituaries or 
solicitations for gifts: "Funds raised will be added to the 
[insert name] Fund at Silicon Valley Community Foundation, 
a 501(c)(3) organization. All checks must be made payable to 
Silicon Valley Community Foundation with [insert name] Fund 
in the memo line." 
Names of donors to memorial funds will be disclosed to 
memorial fund advisors; however, specific gift amounts will not. 
Scholarship Funds 
For any scholarship fund established at the community 
foundation, the scholarship selection committee must be 
appointed by the community foundation; however members 
may be recommended by the donor. The donor and parties 
related to the donor may serve on the selection committee 
but they cannot directly or indirectly control the committee. 
As required by law, the scholarship selection process must 
be approved annually by the community foundation's board 
of directors. The community foundation disburses scholarship 
funds to the institution the recipient attends and will not 
disburse a grant to a specific individual. 
Designated Funds 
Designated funds can only be established for the benefit of 
one qualified public benefit organization. If that organization 
ceases to exist or dramatically changes its charitable 
purpose, the community foundation will use its variance 
power to find a similar organization which matches the 
donor's intent. Should the donor request that the organization 
be changed, all remaining assets will be granted to the 
original organization and a new fund must be established. 
Fund Inactivity 
If a fund advisor is no longer willing or able to advise the 
fund's distribution, and no successor advisor is named, the 
community foundation's board of directors will assume 
responsibility for grantmaking. Inactivity is when no grant 
recommendations or gifts are received for a period of
