VIPA and WICO are both instrumentalities of the Government of the Virgin Islands. However, they are 
each subject to different set of rules and regulatory regimes which have a significant impact on the overall 
economics of the industry. For example, in order to remain competitive, WICO geared its pricing to 
achieve relative parity with Crown Bay, however, WICO has no control over the VIPA-Havensight Fee. 
Therefore WICO has little to no ability to raise its rates without an action by the VIPA to either raise its 
rates at Crown Bay or lower the VIPA-Havensight Fee. In fact, WICO could find itself in a position 
requiring it to lower rates should the VIPA-Havensight Fee be increased without an overall fee increase 
by the VIPA at Crown Bay. Moreover, WICO must ensure an operation equivalent to Crown Bay with 
what understand to be half the per passenger revenue as a large portion of the revenue attributable to the 
\VICO dock is allocated to the VIPA. Based on the financial information provided, this fee structure has 
proven unsustainable for WICO as it faces major challenges accessing the capital markets to meet the 
demands of its customer base (discussed below). 
In addition to issues around fee structure discussed above, we understand WICO to be subject to what 
amounts to be a different exaction regime than the VIPA. In particular, WICO is subject to an annual 
PILOT obligation totaling $700,000 or 8% of its total operating revenues. Much like thc VIPA-
Havensight Fee, the PILOT is an additional government levy on WICO's gross revenues. We understand 
that WIC() has been unable to make the PILOT payment and a large accrued liability of approximately $5 
million sits on its balance sheet which is an yet another impediment to WICO's ability to access the capital 
markets. It is our understanding that WICO must do so in the short term to both meet its obligations to 
its lender (discussed below) as well as to raise new capital to meet the demands of its customers to 
provide new infrastructure to accommodate larger vessels (discussed below). 
B. A Non-Strategic Approach to Passenger Distribution to Retail Centers 
As stated above, St. Thomas is visited by over 1.7 million cruise ship passengers each year (each with a 
$1600 duty free allowance) however the distribution of passengers to the various outlets in St. Thomas is 
somewhat tortured. While the drivers for several successful retail outlets in St. Thomas are clearly in 
place, many of the property owners and merchants continue to experience poor operating results. We 
believe that this is at least in part a result of the disjointed approach to the overall management and 
strategy of the cruise ship industry and several conflicts of interest that diminish the potential arrival 
experience on St. Thomas. 
The retail rental rates across Crown Bay, Havensight, Downtown and YHG (in particular) and overall 
tenancies have suffered in recent years due in part to (i) poor distribution of higher end vessels to Crown 
Bay where a lower quality retail outlet occupies the Crown Bay Center (.e. keeping those tourists with 
greater spend away from the higher end products located in both Downtown and YHG) (i) an existing 
and continuing conflict of interest among WICO in its capacity as YHG's ground landlord and WICO in 
its capacity as manager of the Havensight Mall on behalf of GERS and (iii) the challenges associated with 
organizing and managing the taxi associations. 
As manager of the Havensight Mall, WICO has been unable to balance the demands by GERS and the 
Havensight merchants to direct passengers to Havensight and its obligations to support the operations 
and development of its tenant, YHG. This has resulted in a visually unpleasant and highly confusing 
passenger arrival experience. Rather than being officially welcomed to the Territory, on inspection many 
tourists seem lost and confused by the patchwork of fences, barriers and taxis that greet them upon 
disembarkation. Further, the taxi associations which work at the \VICO dock have little incentive to 
direct traffic to nearby outlets as it results in lower fares. Rather, taxi drivers encourage a trip to the 
Downtown Merchants or Crown Bay Center over YHG or encourage a drop off at Havensight from 
Downtown instead of YHG. In fact, it is our experience that most passengers on arrival are largely 
unaware of the unique retail experience which could await them stretching from Havensight to 
Downtown Charlotte Amalie. Over the years the taxi unions have resisted all efforts at a harbonvide 
water transport system which would effectively level the playing field for all merchants and, if established
