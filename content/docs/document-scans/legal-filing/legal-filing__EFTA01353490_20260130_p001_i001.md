make this information publicly available until after the expire. 
bon date. In this case, the Gash settlement value of a credit 
default option would be zero. There is also a risk that the 
listing options market may determine that a credit event has 
occurred based on information available to it when in fact no 
credit event has occurred. This could happen, for example, if 
the sources used to confirm the credit event are erroneous. 
The rules of OCC and/or the listing options market may 
provide that a confirmation of a credit event or other contract 
adjustment may be revoked up to a specified time prior to 
exercise settlement. Settlements based on a listing options 
market's confirmation of a credit event we irrevocable even if 
no credit event has occurred. 
7. 
Every determination by the listing options market 
of a redemption event, succession event or credit event will 
be within the listing options market's sole discretion and will 
be conclusive and binding on all holders and sellers and not 
subject to review. OCC shall have no authority to make such 
determinations and shall have no responsibility therefor. 
8. 
Prior to the period when a credit default option 
has been automatically exercised, the only means through 
which the holder can realize value from the option is to sell it 
at its then market price in an available secondary market. If a 
secondary market for such an option is not available. it will 
not be possible for its holder to realize any value from the 
option at that time. 
9. 
There is no underlying interest for credit default 
options that is quoted in the marketplace. Because of this. 
there are no underlying interest prices to provide a reference 
to investors for pncing credit default options. 
10. As discussed above under the caption "Other 
Risks," options markets have discretion to halt trading in an 
option in certain circumstances — such as when the market 
determines that the halt would be advisable in maintaining a 
fair and orderly market in the option. In the case of credit 
default options. options markets may take into considera-
tion, among other factors, that current quotes for debt secu-
rities or other securities of the reference entity are unavaila-
ble or have become unreliable. 
11. The risk that a trading market for particular 
options may become unavailable and the potential conse-
quences are also discussed above under the caption "Other 
Risks." The SEC has approved certain credit default options 
for listing and trading on a national securities exchange as 
securities. OCC filed its rules for clearing credit default 
options with the CFTC. and the CFTC issued an exemption 
permitting 0CC to clear such options when traded on a 
national securities exchange whether or not they are within 
the CFTC's jurisdiction. By its terms. the exemption is revo-
cable, and its revocation would be one of the events that 
could lead to the unavailability of a trading market for credit 
default options.
