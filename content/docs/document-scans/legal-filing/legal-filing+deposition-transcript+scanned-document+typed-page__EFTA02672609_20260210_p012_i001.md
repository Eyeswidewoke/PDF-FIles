The 1.4 million active-service military members, meanwhile, will get paid no matter how long the shutdown 
lasts. That's because =he House and Senate specifically passed a bill to guarantee active-duty military pay even when 
the government is closed. Obama signed it into law Monday nigh=. 
So which parts of government actually shut dow=? 
Closed! Well, unless Arizona wants to pay to operate it. 
Everything else, basically. It's a fairly long =ist, and you can check out in detail which activities the agencies are 
planning to halt =n these contingency plans posted by each agency. Here are a few select exa=ples: 
Health: The National Institutes of Health stopped accepting new patients for clinical research a=d stop 
answering hotline calls about medical questions. The Centers for Di=ease Control and Prevention stopped its seasonal 
flu program and have a "significantly reduced capacity to respond to outbreak investigations." 
Housing: The Department of Housing and Urban Development are not be able to provide loca= housing 
authorities with additional money for housing vouchers. The nati=n's 3,300 public housing authorities have also stopped 
receiving payments, alth=ugh most of these agencies have enough cash on hand to provide rental assistanc= through 
the end of October. 
Immigration: T=e Department of Homeland Security no longer operates its E-Verify program, which means that 
businesses are not able to check on the legal immigration status of prospective employees during the shutdown. 
Parks=and museums: The National Park Service closed more than 400 national parks and museums, including 
Yosemite National Park in California, Alcatraz in San Francisco, and the Statue of Liberty in New York. The last time this 
hap=ened during the 1995.96 shutdown, some 7 million visitors were turned away. (=ne big exception was the south 
rim of the Grand Canyon, which stayed open only bec=use Arizona agreed to pick up the tab.) 
Regulatory ag=ncies: The Environmental Protection Agency have closed down almost entirely during a 
shutdown, save for operations around Superfund sites. Many of t=e Labor Department's regulatory offices are closed, 
including the Wage an= Hour Division and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. (The Min= Safety and 
Health Administration stayed open.) 
Finan=ial regulators. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the vast U.S. derivatives 
market, are largely sh=t down. A few financial regulators, however, such as the Securities and Ex=hange Commission, 
has remain open. 
(Small parts of) Soc=al Security: The Social Security Administration has retain a skeleton staff to make sure the 
checks keep goi=g out. But the agency won't have enough employees to do things lik= help recipients replace their 
benefit cards or schedule new hearings for disability cases.<=span> 
Visas and passports: The State Department says it will keep most passport agencies and consular operations 
open so long as it has the funds to do so, although som= activities might be interrupted. (For instance, "if a passport 
a=ency is located in a government building affected by a lapse in appropriations, the facility may become unsupported.") 
During t=e previous shutdown in 1995-'96, around 20,000 to 30,000 applications from foreigners for visas went 
unprocessed each day. =A0This time around, the State Department is planning to continue processing visas through the 
shutdown, since those operations are largely funded by fees collected. 
Veterans: Some key benefits has continued and the VA hospitals remains open. But many services have been 
disrupted. The Veterans Benefits Administration will =e unable to process education and rehabilitation benefits. And 
the Board of Veter=ns' Appeals will be unable to hold hearings.
