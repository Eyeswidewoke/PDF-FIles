1967) (finding no contract formation because the "offer clearly specifie[d] the time and 
manner in which acceptance . . . was to be consummated" and the offeree had not 
complied with the specifications); Johnson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 178 Wn. App. 828, 
316 P.3d 1054, 1060 (2013) (finding no contract formation because the plaintiffs putative 
acceptance did not meet the plain language of the offers requirements). Ordinarily, 
whether there was mutual assent to the terms of an offer is a question of fact for the jury. 
Keystone Land & Dev. Co. v. Xerox Corp., 152 Wn.2d 171, 94 P.3d 945, 949 (Wash. 
2004). 
Here, there is no dispute that Mr. Steadman did not comply with BoA's specified manner of 
acceptance. (Steadman Dep. at 104:2-106:20.) Ordinarily, this failure would prevent 
formation of a contract. ['17]See Corbit, 424 P.2d at 299. Mr. Steadman, however, claims 
that Mr. Ngo waived the specified requirements when he told Mr. Steadman he "could 
submit the final loan modification documents by bringing them to [Mr. Ngo's] office in 
downtown Seattle" and "informed [Mr. Steadman] that [his] actions were sufficient to 
accept the loan modification offer.'" (Steadman Decl. at 2.) 
3 Green Tree moves to strike Mr. Steadman's testimony about Mr. Ngo's statements as hearsay. (See Reply at 2.) However, in 
general, "oUr-of-court statements that are offered as evidence of legally operative verbal conduct are not hearsay.' United 
States v. Pang. 362 F.3d 1187. 1192 (9th Cir. 2004). Because such statements have independent legal significance. they are 
considered "verbal acts," and are exempted from the definition of hearsay. Id: see also Viall v. Scott. 943 F.2d 56 (9th Cr. 
1991). Specifically. 'proof of oral utterances by the parties in a contract suit constituting the offer and acceptance which brought 
the contract into being, are not evidence of assertions offered testimorially but rather of utterances verbal conduct to which the 
law attaches duties and liabilities.' N.L.R.8. v. H. Koch 8 Sons. 578 F.2d 1287. 1290-91 (9th Cir. 1978): see also United States 
v. Rubier. 651 F.2d 628. 630 (9th Cr. 1981) (-Facts of independent legal significance constituting a contract which is at issue 
are not hearsay.") Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit held that ('18) testimony that a third party accepted a contract during an out-
of-court telephone conversation was not hearsay because it was not introduced to prove the truth of the third party's assertion, 
but rather "only to show that [the third party] uttered words of assent. regardless of their truth.' H. Koch 8 Sons. 578 F.2d at 
1290-91. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that "the truth of (the third party's] words was completely irrelevant, for to lead a person 
reasonably to suppose that you assert to an oral agreement is to assent to it. contrary intentions notwithstanding." Id. internal 
quotations and alterations omitted): see also Calif. Trucking Ass n v. Bhd of Teamsters 8 Auto Truck Drivers. Local 70. 679 
F.2d 1275. 1291 (9th Cir. 1981) ('The out-of-court statement of the (company) representative was not offered for the truth of the 
matter asserted; rather, the statement had an operative effect n the nature of a contract rejection wholly apart from the truth of 
the assertion"). 
Similarly. here, Mr. Ngo's out-of-court statements are not introduced for their 'truth,' but rather to show that Mr. Ngo uttered 
legally operative words that brought a contract into being. See H. Koch 8 Sons. 578 F.2d at 1290-91. Because Mr. Ngo's 
representation that Mr. Steadman could tender acceptance in a different manner effectively modified or re-stated BoA's offer to 
RN. Steadman. they r19] are utterances of verbal conduct. See id. The truth of the words is irrelevant, for to lead Mr. 
Steadman to supposed that BoA assented to his different form of acceptance was to assent to it, contrary intentions (or 
mistaken impressions) notwithstanding. See id. As such, Mr. Ngo's statements are rot hearsay. Therefore. the court denies 
Green Tree's motion to strike. See Adair v. Safeco Ins. Co.. No. CV-O9-31-BUSEH-RKS. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51185, 2010 
WL 2079542. at '4 (D. Mont. May 24. 2010) ("Evidence of the alleged statement is evidence of a verbal act, an utterance that is 
itself an operative fact giving rise to legal consequences. The statement is admitted to show that it actually occurred, not for the 
truth of the statement's contents."). In so ruling, the court does not pass on Mr. Ngo's actual or apparent authority to make such 
representations, or the extent to which the statements bind BoA See id. 
An agent can bind his or her principal to a contract when the agent has either actual or 
apparent authority. King v. Riveland, 125 Wn.2d 500, 886 P.2d 160, 165 (Wash. 1994). 
"Both actual and apparent authority depend upon objective manifestations made by the 
principal." Id. 'With actual authority, the principal's objective manifestations are made to 
the agent; with apparent authority, they are made to a third person." Id. "Such rail 
manifestations will support a finding of apparent authority only if they have two effects." Id. 
"First, they must cause the one claiming apparent authority to actually, or subjectively,
