April 23 -- A =a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/21/=R2010122104371.html" 
target="_blank"> New START treaty reestablishing the process of nuclear arms control has=recently taken effect. 
Combined with reductions in the U.S. defense budget= this will bring the number of nuclear weapons in the United 
States to the=lowest overall level since the 1950s. The Obama administration is said to be considering negotiations for=a 
new round of nuclear reductions <http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-h=use-weighs-
nuclear-arms-cuts-but-will-wait-for-more-talks-with-russia/2012=02/14/gIQAfdDgER_story.html> to bring about ceilings 
as low as 300 w=rheads. Before momentum builds on that basis, we feel obliged to stress ou= conviction that the goal of 
future negotiations should be strategic stabi=ity and that lower numbers of weapons should be a consequence of 
strategic analysis, not an abstract preconceive= determination. 
Regardless of one=92s vision of the ultimate future of nuclear weapons, the overarching goal=of contemporary U.S. 
nuclear policy must be to ensure that nuclear weapons=are never used. Strategic stability is not inherent with low 
numbers of weapons; indeed, excessively low numbers =ould lead to a situation in which surprise attacks are 
conceivable. 
We supported ratifi=ation of the START treaty. We favor verification of agreed reductions and =rocedures that enhance 
predictability and transparency. One of us (Kissing=r) has supported working toward the elimination of nuclear weapons, 
albeit with the proviso that a series of v=rifiable intermediate steps that maintain stability precede such an end po=nt 
and that every stage of the process be fully transparent and verifiable= 
The precondition of=the next phase of U.S. nuclear weapons policy must be to enhance and enshr=ne the strategic 
stability that has preserved global peace and prevented t=e use of nuclear weapons for two generations. 
Eight key facts sho=ld govern such a policy: 
First, strategic st=bility requires maintaining strategic forces of sufficient size 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-anno=nces-new-military-
approach/2012/01/05/gIQAFWcmcP_story.html> and composition that a first strike=cannot reduce retaliation to a level 
acceptable to the aggressor. 
Second, in assessin= the level of unacceptable damage, the United States cannot assume that a =otential enemy will 
adhere to values or calculations identical to our own.=We need a sufficient number of weapons to pose a threat to what 
potential aggressors value under every conceivabl= circumstance. We should avoid strategic analysis by mirror-imaging. 
Third, the composit=on of our strategic forces cannot be defined by numbers alone. It also dep=nds on the type of 
delivery vehicles and their mix. If the composition of =he U.S. deterrent force is modified as a result of reduction, 
agreement or for other reasons, a sufficient var=ety must be retained, together with a robust supporting command and 
contro= system, so as to guarantee that a preemptive attack cannot succeed. 
Fourth, in deciding=on force levels and lower numbers, verification is crucial. Particularly i=portant is a determination of 
what level of uncertainty threatens the calc=lation of stability. At present, that level is well within the capabilities of the 
existing verification systems= We must be certain that projected levels maintain — and when possible, =einforce — that 
confidence. 
Fifth, the global n=nproliferation regime has been weakened to a point where some of the proli=erating countries are 
reported to have arsenals of more than 100 weapons. =nd these arsenals are growing. At what lower U.S. levels could 
these arsenals constitute a strategic threat? What=will be their strategic impact if deterrence breaks down in the overall 
st=ategic relationship? Does this prospect open up the risk of hostile allian=es between countries whose forces 
individually are not adequate to challenge strategic stability but that co=bined might overthrow the nuclear equation?
