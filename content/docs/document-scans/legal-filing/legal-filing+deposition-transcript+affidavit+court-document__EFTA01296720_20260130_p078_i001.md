presuppose that wrongdoing took place. After its in camera review, the Court finds that 
Petitioners have not made a prima facie showing of serious misconduct sufficient to negate 
the protections of the work product doctrine. 
Materials constituting the opinion work product of the Governments attorneys shall 
therefore be withheld from Petitioners. Certain documents that the Court considers fact-
based work product may be produced subject to relevancy considerations discussed 
below. 
B. Relevancy p26] of Requests for Production 
In addition to asserting privileges, the Government responds to Petitioners' first request for 
production by arguing that many of the materials requested are not relevant to the instant 
CVRA litigation. (DE 260). 
Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure defines the general scope of discovery as 
follows: 
Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense--
including the existence. description, nature. custody. condition. and location of any documents or other tangible things 
and the identity and location of persons who know of any discoverable matter. . . . Relevant intonation need not be 
admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). "Discovery should ordinarily be allowed unless it is clear that the 
information sought has no possible bearing on the claims and defenses of the parties or 
otherwise on the subject matter of the action." Milinazzo v. State Farm Ins. Co., 247 F.R.D. 
691, 695-96 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (citing Dunkin' Donuts, Inc. v. Mary's Donuts, Inc., No. 01-
0392, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25205, 2001 WL 34079319, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 1, 2001)). 
1. Request No. 1--the FBI File on the Epstein Matter and Indictment Material 
In their first request for production, Petitioners seek the file generated by the FBI in the 
Epstein matter, including all documents "collected as part r271 of its case against and/or 
investigation of Epstein." (DE 260 at 2). Petitioners also request that the Government 
produce all prosecution memoranda and draft indictments prepared in the case. (Id.). The 
Government argues that such materials regarding its decision to prosecute Epstein are 
irrelevant to the issue of whether they denied Petitioners their rights under the CVRA. (Id.). 
Petitioners disagree. They argue that "materials going to the strength of the Government's 
case against Epstein" are a "vital part" of their case against the Government. (DE at 266 at 
8). "Those materials would directly demonstrate that the Government had an extremely 
strong case against Epstein, giving the Government a motive for needing to keep the 
victims in the dark about the plea deal." (Id.). The Court concludes that discovery should 
not extend to these materials. 
First, the Court finds that all prosecution memoranda, research into indictable offenses, 
and draft indictments are protected opinion work product. These documents were created 
by the Government in anticipation of a possible prosecution of Epstein and evince the 
Government's internal mental impressions, legal theories, and strategy concerning the 
issues presented by a ['28] possible prosecution. As discussed above, Petitioners have
