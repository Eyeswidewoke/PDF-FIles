offering rights, individual RRA Holders that together own Registrable Securities 
representing at least 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock have 
the right to demand the Company to effectuate the distribution of any or all of their 
Registrable Securities by means of an underwritten offering pursuant to the Shelf 
Registration Statement. No individual holder may exercise this right more than two times. 
The Company is not obligated to effect an underwritten demand notice within 90 days of 
closing another underwritten offering. Under their piggyback registration rights, if at any 
time the Company proposes to conduct an underwritten offering for its own account, the 
Company must allow such RRA Holders to include a specified number of their Registrable 
Securities in the offering. These rights are subject to certain conditions and limitations, 
including certain rights to limit the number of shares to be included in an underwritten 
offering and the Company's right to delay or withdraw a registration statement or an offer 
and sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement (including 
underwritten offerings) under certain circumstances. The registration rights granted in the 
Registration Rights Agreement are subject to customary indemnification and contribution 
provisions. 
The summary of the Registration Rights Agreement set forth in this Item 1.01 does not 
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the 
Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is being filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and is 
incorporated herein by reference. 
Warrant Agreement 
On July 27, 2016, the Company entered into a warrant agreement (the 'Warrant 
Agreement") with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as warrant agent (the 
'Warrant Agent"). Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, the Company issued two series of 
warrants (the "Series A Warrants" and the "Series B Warrants", together, the "Warrants") 
to the holders of the Company's common stock as of July 26, 2016, such Warrants to 
expire at the close of business on July 27, 2021 (the "Expiration Date"). Following July 27, 
2016, there are 154,108 Series A Warrants outstanding to purchase up to an aggregate of 
154,108 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $10.30 per share (the 
"Series A Exercise Price"). Following July 27, 2016, there are 154,108 Series B Warrants 
outstanding to purchase up to an aggregate of 154,108 shares of common stock at an 
initial exercise price of $12.88 per share (the "Series B Exercise Price"). The Warrants 
may generally be exercised during the period commencing 30 days prior to the Expiration 
Date, subject to receipt by the Company of certain Alaska tax credits. Upon issuance, the 
shares issued under the Warrants will represent 4.5% of the outstanding shares of 
common stock as of July 27, 2016, subject to the issuance of (i) additional shares of 
common stock under a new 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which, once adopted, will 
reserve 1,038,258 shares of common stock for issuance, and (ii) 132,093 shares of 
common stock to the lenders under the New Senior Loan Facility as an anti-dilution 
protection relative to the Warrants.
