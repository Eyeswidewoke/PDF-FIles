785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
discriminated against at Nucor." J.A. 6109. The same employee was actually "upset by this 
racial discrimination issue because it is not something that has happened to me or is 
happening across the board here at Nucor." Id. Another employee explained that "the way 
things are done . . . at Nucor are not influenced by race." J.A. 6164. 
The list goes on: black employees approved of management's handling of race-related 
issues in the plant, see, e.g., J.A. 6109, 6215, 6480-81, 6943, explained that they were 
treated well, see, e.g., J.A. 6350, 6361, and often reasoned that complaints of racism from 
other employees were unjustified, see, e.g., J.A. 6566. Even those who felt that 
promotions were not made fairly often blamed factors other than race, such as a "buddy" 
system in which supervisors promoted friends. See, e.g., J.A. 6258, 6299, 6438, 6494. 
Some affidavits also directly contradicted ["142] the sixteen declarations that Plaintiffs 
submitted. In fact, Jacob Ravenell, Kenneth Hubbard, Robyn Spann, and Byron Turner all 
expressly denied that they had been denied promotions because of their race, even 
though Plaintiffs cite them as four of their sixteen key witnesses. See J.A. 6400, 6746, 
6933, 6964. The district court had every right to weigh such self-contradictory testimony 
and conclude as it did. See Stevenson v. City of Seat Pleasant, Md., 743 F.3d 411, 422 
(4th Cir. 2014). 
b. 
Based on "[c]ommon sense and prudence," however, the majority finds yet again that the 
district court clearly erred — this time by finding that "potentially coercive" affidavits 
supported Nucor to some small degree. Maj. op. at 42. The majority's naked credibility 
determination is exactly the sort of decision we are not meant to undertake on appellate 
review. "[W]hen a trial judge's finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of [a 
witness who] . . . has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by 
extrinsic evidence, that finding, if not internally inconsistent, can virtually never be clear 
error." Anderson, 470 U.S. at 575. 
The majority nevertheless adopts a self-contradictory credibility rule: statements made in 
support of an employer must be rejected when the employer ["143] obtains them, while 
statements made against the employer will be given "significant weight given the 
circumstances in which they were made." Maj. op. at 43. The majority draws this 
distinction by assuming that an employer exercises coercive power in most any interaction 
with its employees. "However, it is well settled that not every interrogation of employees by 
Company officials constitutes coercion[.]" NLRB v. Lexington Chair Co., 361 F.2d 283, 289 
(4th Cir. 1966). And one must not lose sight of the practical effect of the majority's novel 
approach: employers now have no incentive to investigate and remedy claims of 
discrimination. Employers will well understand that investigations can no longer benefit 
them -- at most, facts developed during an investigation will only be used against the 
employer. Even an employer with a supportive workforce will be unable to defend itself 
with beneficial employee testimony, lest it be accused of unproven coercion. Informal 
resolution, p952] Congress' preferred course, will therefore become even more difficult. 
See West v. Gibson, 527 U.S. 212, 218-19, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1999) 
(noting Congress's intention that Title VII claims would be resolved informally).
