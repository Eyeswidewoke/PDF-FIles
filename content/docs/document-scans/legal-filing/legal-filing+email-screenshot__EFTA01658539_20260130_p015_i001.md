Lawsuit Alleges Indian Hackers Leaked Businessman's Emails. 
Reuters (10/19) reports, "Iranian-American businessman Farhad Azima has accused a pair of 
Indian companies of stealing his emails and publishing them to the web, according to a lawsuit 
filed in federal court in North Carolina." According to Reuters, "Azima's suit alleges that Indian 
security company CyberRoot Risk Advisory and New Delhi-based BellTroX InfoTech Services 
carried out the hack-and-leak at the behest of American private intelligence company Vital 
Management Services, which in turn had been hired by the international law firm Dechert on 
behalf of the Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority (RAKIA), an investment fund based in the 
United Arab Emirates. Reuters reported in June that BellTroX was at the center of a years-long 
hacking campaign that targeted more than 10,000 accounts across the globe, citing three 
former employees, outside researchers and a trail of online evidence." 
Bloomberg (10/19, Turton, 4.73M) reports, "A years-long legal dispute between" Azima 
"and the Investment Authority of Ras Al Khaimah, one of the seven emirates that make up the 
United Arab Emirates, has now entangled a private investigator in North Carolina and two 
hacking-for-hire firms in India." Bloomberg adds that in the lawsuit, Azima, "an Iranian aviation 
executive who lives and works in America, accused law firm Dechert LLP of hiring a private 
investigator, Nicholas Del Rosso, who then allegedly hired hackers in India to steal documents 
from Azima. Nicholas Del Rosso and his company Vital Management Services Inc. are named as 
defendants in the suit. Dechert LLP isn't a named party in the suit. Azima is seeking monetary 
damages and an injunction against further hacking." The lawsuit "comes after reporting by 
Bloomberg and Reuters earlier this year that showed an Indian company, Belltrox Infotech 
Services, had for years worked as a 'hacking-for-hire' service, targeting more than 10,000 
people and companies."

Pro-Iran Trolls Spreading Fake Scandals Posted On Legitimate News Sites By Hackers. 
The Daily Beast (10/19, 1.39M) reports, "Over the past year, hackers have broken into a 
number of news organizations' Twitter accounts and at least one website to plant fake stories." 
One such series of "fake scandals" was when "an Israeli news outlet's hacked Twitter account 
tried to fool readers into believing for a few brief moments earlier this month." The account 
promoted fake scandals such as that "President Trump [was] dying of coronavirus and handing 
over power to Mike Pence." Another was of "Black Lives Matter protesters surrounding the 
Clintons' house in New York and firing gunshots." Though it is "still unclear who was responsible 
for the account break-ins amplified by Iranian linked trolls," cybersecurity researchers such as 
Mandiant Threat Intelligence's Lee Foster are concerned about hackers "compromising 
legitimate news sites to post fabricated news articles."
