In essence, the=lranian regime's approach toward sex, like its philosophy of governance, is=marked by =aslahat, 
or expediency, and used alternately as a tool of suppre=sion, inducement, and incitement. In the summer of 2009, when 
hundreds of t=ousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest Ahmadinejad's reelection= many protesters were 
brutally beaten by the Basij militia, gangs of young r=gime thugs on motorbikes who were given a green light to quell the 
uprising= As Iranian-American academic Shervin Malekzadeh reported from Tehran, the B=sij seemed to be driven by a 
combination of class resentment and pent-up fr=stration. "They don't screw; they don't drink or smoke joints," one of 
his s=urces told him. "What else are they going to do with all of that energy?" 
But perhaps the seminal -- and mos= heartbreaking -- moment of the Green Revolution was the murder of a 26-
yea=-old female protester, Neda Agha-Soltan, whose bloody death was caught on c=11-phone camera and rendered one 
of the most viral videos in history. In an=nbsp;HBO documentary <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYN53BOeijY> 
about h=r life, Neda's mother recalls a message <http:Mezebel.com/neda-agha-soltan> that some sympathetic f=male 
Basij members relayed to Neda days before she was killed by a sniper: "=ear, please don't come out looking so 
beautiful.... Do us a favor and=don't come out because the Basiji men target beautiful girls. And they will=shoot you." 
While the iconic faces of l=an's 1979 revolution were bearded, middle-aged men, Neda has come to symbol=ze 
the new face of dissent in 21st-century Iran: a young, modern, educated w=man. For her opposition to the regime and 
to the hijab, she is the embodime=t of fitna in Khamenei's eyes. 
THREE SPRINGS LATER, t=e Iranian regime once again is faced with a crisis, this time of an externa= variety. As 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatens war in bet=een meals, the Pentagon plays war games and policy 
planners huddle in the Write House: Is the Iranian regime rational or irrational? Can diplomatic neg=tioations prevent 
Iran from obtaining a bomb, or is an attack on Iran's nuc=ear facilities inevitable? 
Many Iran watchers assert that to persuade Tehran not to pursu= a nuclear weapon, Washington must reassure 
Khamenei that the United States=merely seeks a change in Iranian behavior, not a change of the Iranian regi=e. 
What they fail to consider is Khamenei's deep-seated c=nviction that U.S. designs to overthrow the Islamic 
Republic hinge not on m=litary invasion but on cultural and political subversion intended to foment=a "velvet" 
revolution from within. Consider this revealing address 
<http://78.=6.108.112/view_video.php?viewkey=cad7789c1e3d43ea1522&page=&vie=type=&category=> &n=sp;on 
Iranian state TV in 2005: 
<=p> 
=ore than Iran's enemies need artillery, guns, and so forth, they need to sp=ead cultural values that lead to 
moral corruption.... I recently read=in the news that a senior official in an important American political cente= said: 
"Instead of bombs, send them miniskirts." He is right. If they arous= sexual desires in any given country, if they spread 
unrestrained mixing of=men and women, and if they lead youth to behavior to which they are natural=y inclined by 
instincts, there will no longer be any need for artillery and=guns against that nation. 
Khamenei's v=st collection of writings and speeches makes clear that the weapons of mass=destruction he fears 
most are cultural -- more Kim Kardashian and Lady Gaga=than bunker busters and aircraft carriers. In other words, 
Tehran is threat=ned not only by what America does, but by what America is: a depraved, post=odern colonial power
