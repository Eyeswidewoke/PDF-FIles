HOW the Notes Work 
Upside Scenario: 
If the Final Value is greater than the Initial Value, investors will receive at maturity the $1,000 principal amount plus a return equal to the 
Index Return times the Upside Leverage Factor of 2.00, subject to the Maximum Return of at least 40.00%. 
• 
If the closing level of the Index increases 5.00%, investors will receive at maturity a 10.00% return, or S1,100.00 per $1,000 
principal amount note. 
• 
Assuming a hypothetical Maximum Return of 40.00%, if the closing level of the Index increases by 40.00%, investors will receive at 
maturity a return equal to the 40.00% Maximum Return, or $1,400.00 per $1,000 principal amount note, which is the maximum 
payment at maturity. 
Par Scenario: 
If the Final Value is equal to the Initial Value or is less than the Initial Value by up to the Contingent Buffer Amount of 25 00%, investors 
will receive at maturity the principal amount of their notes. 
Downside Scenario: 
If the Final Value is less than the Initial Value by more than the Contingent Buffer Amount of 25.00%, investors will lose 1% of the 
principal amount of their notes for every 1% that the Final Value is less than the Initial Value. 
• 
For example, if the closing level of the Index declines 60.00%, investors will lose 60.00% of their pnnopal amount and receive only 
$400.00 per $1,000 principal amount note at matunty. 
The hypothetical retums and hypothetical payments on the notes shown above apply only if you hold the notes for their entire term. 
These hypotheticals do not reflect the fees or expenses that would be associated with any sale in the secondary market If these fees 
and expenses were included, the hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments shown above would likely be lower. 
Selected Risk Considerations 
An investment in the notes involves significant risks These risks are explained in more detail in the 'Risk Factors' sections of the 
accompanying product supplement and underlying supplement 
• 
YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES MAY RESULT IN A LOSS —
The notes do not guarantee any return of principal If the Final Value is less than the Initial Value by more than 25.00%, you will 
lose 1% of the principal amount of your notes for every 1% that the Final Value is less than the Initial Value by more than 25.00% 
Accordingly, you will lose more than 25.00% of your principal amount at maturity and could lose all of your principal amount at 
maturity. 
• 
YOUR MAXIMUM GAIN ON THE NOTES IS LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM RETURN, 
regardless of the appreciation in the level of the Index, which may be significant. 
• 
CREDIT RISK OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. —
Investors are dependent on JPMorgan Chase & Co 's ability to pay all amounts due on the notes. My actual or potential change in 
our creditworthiness or credit spreads, as determined by the market for taking our credit risk, is likely to adversely affect the value 
of the notes. If we were to default on our payment obligations. you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the notes and 
you could lose your entire investment. 
•

potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes. It is possible that hedging or trading activities of ours or our
