The Whitesides Lab 
606-064 
The Commercialization of Ideas 
Although Whitesides tried to confine his research to breakthrough science, a smaller 
complementary effort created intellectual property (see Exhibits 14 and 15) to facilitate the 
commercialization of the lab's research products; this represented only a part of the transfer of 
original work to industry, however. Whitesides had cofounded a dozen companies, for which his role 
was not just to supply the original science to start the company, but also to provide advice for the 
ongoing development of the underlying technology and applications. Some startups were founded 
on intellectual property (IP) from his lab (often by lab graduates), while others were founded, in 
whole or in part, on the original ideas and broad concepts that came from Whitesides' inventive 
mind. Examples of the latter sort included Genzyme, Geltex Pharmaceuticals, and Advanced 
Magnetics. Examples of startups more directly connected to the lab's IP were Theravance, Surface 
Logix, Nano-Terra, and Clams Diagnostics. 
Carmichael Roberts16 explained, 
There are physical things as well as ideas that spin out of George's lab. In the case of 
GelTex, it was an idea that was based on some broad, fundamental scientific work that George 
was doing, but there was never any direct work done on a polymer in George's lab. George 
believed that the engineering of materials and figuring out how to design the surfaces of them 
to interact with things in biology were important. GelTex made all of the materials and the 
direction came out of George's head, but was never done in his academic lab; but the basic 
science that one would need to understand it was. 
The scale and scope of Whitesides' Lab provided a plethora of science concepts. This was possible 
since ideas in his lab were generated very quickly. Bryan Roberts" commented, "One of the 
foundations for biomedical progress in the U.S. in general, and George specifically, is the 
government's funding of really basic research. Large-scale funding of basic research is, in my view, 
very important in stimulating innovation. One may not immediately see what the commercial 
application will be, but basic research provides the infrastructure for advances that result in 
commercially relevant products." People who founded businesses with Whitesides described him as 
a person who was frequently the source of initial and ongoing ideas that brought scientific solutions 
to commercial problems; he was outstanding at taking complicated problems and simplifying them. 
"With GelTex," Tananbaum (Prospect Venture Partners) noted, "once a problem was defined, George 
generated dozens and dozens of possible solutions." 
Tananbaum was involved in a second startup based on broad ideas whose IP came only after the 
company was founded: "George and I had talked for years about multivalency, which became the 
underlying science for Theravance." With Tananbaum and Burt Christensen's filling key leadership 
roles, the company was founded in 1997 and began developing specific applications of what was 
originally just a scientific concept. 
In terms of return to investors over the last 10 years in healthcare, GelTex and Theravance were 
viewed as very successful startups (e.g., GelTex was acquired by Genzyme for S1.6B in 2000). 
16 Carmichael Roberts, president and cofounder of Surface Logix, had been a postdoc in the Whitesides lab and also obtained 
his MBA degree from MIT's Sloan School. 
"Bryan Roberts (Venrock Associates, general partner since 2000) spent three years in investment banking before getting a 
Ph.D. in chemistry at Harvard. After earning his Ph.D. degree, he won a Kaufman Fellowship to intern in venture capital. 
18 Burt Christensen was the retired head of R&D at Merck PharmaceuticaLs. Whitesides and Roy Vagelos, Merck's former CEO, 
also served as company directors.
