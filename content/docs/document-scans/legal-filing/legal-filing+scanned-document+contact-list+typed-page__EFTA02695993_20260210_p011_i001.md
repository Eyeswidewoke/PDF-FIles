Tram et al

result. Acknowledging methodological differences with our 
study, most notably the timing of auditory stimulation, we 
interpret the findings of Bo and Callaghan as broadly consistent 
with ours. 
Beneficial effects of controlled auditory stimulation on 
acute pain and stress have been observed in the setting of 
other medical procedures. In a randomized trial of 58 healthy 
male neonates undergoing circumcision, Marchette et al74
reported that they were less likely to have tachycardia toward 
the end of the procedure (tightening the clamp, waiting for 
hemostasis, and cutting foreskin) if recorded "classical music 
for neonates"t1'2O  was played. Burke ct a175 found that 
synthesized female vocals and womb sounds stabilized HR 
and behavioral agitation in 4 neonates following endotracheal 
suctioning, which is frequently performed in critically ill, 
intubated infants on mechanical ventilation. Chou et al,76
using the same auditory stimuli of Burke et al, reported that 
the musical stimuli improved O2-sat during endotracheal suc-
tioning and may have hastened its return to baseline levels 
after suctioning in 30 infants. 
We explored the use of music to reduce stress caused by cra-
nial ultrasound in a set of fraternal twins. One twin was played 
lullabies following the procedure and was found to have a 
lower mean HR, and unlike the unstimulated twin, did not cry. 
These anecdotal observations raise the possibility that music 
might decrease stress caused by cranial ultrasound, a procedure 
that is commonly performed on premature infants. 
Concluding Remarks 
There is growing awareness of the need for better manage-
ment of pain and stress in hospitalized infants who undergo 
many medical procedures, standardized approaches to man-
aging procedure-induced pain remain lacking.5941•63'77
Whereas the risk: benefit ratio of treatment with opioids and 
sedatives is high, owing to steep dose-response curves and the 
potentially devastating consequences of respiratory depression, 
nonpharmacological interventions such as controlled auditory 
stimulation with music carry little or no risk to the infant. The 
amount, timing, and type of controlled auditory stimulation 
that maximize its amelioration of procedure-induced distress 
remain unclear, and they may not be easy to predict. Future 
investigations aimed at optimizing and standardizing the use 
of music, other auditory stimuli, and multimodal treatment 
incorporating auditory stimuli are needed to advance the 
efforts to alleviate pain and stress in this needy patient 
population.
