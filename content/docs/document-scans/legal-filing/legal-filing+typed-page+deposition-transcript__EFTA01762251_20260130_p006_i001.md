political party or movement, politely declined. Nevertheless, the Muslim Brotherhood managed to spread its doctr=ne in 
the Arabian Peninsula, particularly through immigration of members o= the movement who fled the Nasser regime. 
The first real shock that hit the relationship between Riyadh and the Broth=rhood took place following the Iraqi invasion 
of Kuwait in 1990. While Sau=i Arabia relied on the US to liberate the occupied emirate and to ensure i=s own security 
against the threat of Saddam Hussein, the Muslim Brotherhood opposed Western intervention. Th=s position was 
interpreted as a sign of ingratitude. Following the liberat=on of Kuwait in 1991, Saudi Arabia witnessed the appearance 
of the first o=position movement, Al-Sahwa (Awakening), which challenged throughout the 90s the absolute monarchy 
of Al-Saud and c=lled for political reforms. Some Saudi leaders accused the Brotherhood of =eing Al-Sahwa's inspiration. 
The second shock, more violent, that hit the relationship between the Broth=rhood and Saudi Arabia came following the 
attacks of 11 September 2001 in =he United States. Some 15 of the 19 alleged attackers were Saudis. Part of=Saudi's 
rulers threw the blame for this "deviation" of some young Saudis on the doctrinal activ=sm advocated by the Muslim 
Brotherhood, particularly their most famous ide=logue, Saved Qutb, hanged by the Nasser regime in 1966. The Saudi 
interior=minister at the time, and the crown prince from October 2011 until his death on 16 June 2012, Nayef Bin Abdel-
Aziz, a=cused the Muslim Brotherhood in 2002 of being the origin of most problems rn the Arab world. 
"The Brotherhood has done great damage to Saudi Arabia ... All our pro=lems come from the Muslim Brotherhood ... 
The Muslim Brotherhood has destr=yed the Arab world," he said firmly. 
However, the danger perceived by Al-Saud family from the Muslim Brotherhood=remained remote, as the movement 
was in opposition. Its coming to power in=Egypt and Tunisia — and perhaps tomorrow in Syria — thanks to unexpect=d 
popular uprisings, completely changed the situation. Hence the attitude of the less reserved Saudi authorities v=s-a-vis 
the new regime in Egypt. Riyadh fears that the rise to power of =he Brotherhood encourages Islamist opposition inspired 
by that movement to=resume activities within the kingdom. 
The arrest in the United Arab Emirates in late 2012 of 11 Egyptians accused=of forming a Brotherhood cell to help 
overthrow the UAE regime only reinfo=ced these fears. 
But far from the alleged plots against the Gulf States, the Saudi ruling fa=ily perceives the Brotherhood and its doctrine 
as an ideological rival to =ahhabism, which may spread and sow discord in the kingdom or threaten the =onarchy. It is 
not surprising in this context that several reports underlined Saudi financial support for t=e Egyptian Salafist current in 
the last parliamentary elections in late 20=1. 
The perception of danger also has a regional dimension, as some Saudi leade=s feared the rise of an alliance between 
Egypt, Turkey and Qatar — the o=ly Gulf state to maintain close ties with the Muslim Brotherhood — which=may reduce 
the dominant regional influence Saudi Arabia had exercised through its alliance with Mubarak's Egypt and S=ria's Bashar 
Al-Assad. 
In France, Qatar owns the popular soccer team Paris Saint=Germain and the accompanying PSG handball team. In 
addition it has &=bsp;holdings in Louis Vuitton as well as in French heavy industry, in the French oil company Total, in 
the media, and in real=estate on the French Riviera. Through its Al Jazeera Sports, it laun=hed the French TV channel 
beIN Sport. With its investment fund,=Divine Investments SA, it is preparing to buy Printemps, the department store 
chain, a transaction worth $2 billion. &nb=p;lt outbid Galeries Lafayette, the other great French store, which was 
=nterested in buying its rival.</=> 
In Italy, Qatar controls the fashion house Valentino. &nb=p;It has holdings in Tiffany's, in Credit Suisse, in the Banco 
Santander=Brasil, and in the Agricultural Bank of China. In March 2013, the emir of Qatar, who already had investments 
in Gre=ce, bought six Greek islands in the Echinades, in the Ionian Sea, for abou= $10 million; he intends to build palaces 
there for his three wives and 24=children. In Germany, the Qatar holdings include high-end real estate property in 
Berlin, including the five-star G=and Hyatt hotel in Potsdamer Platz, as well as holdings in Porsche, Volksw=gon, 
Siemens, and the construction group Hochtief.
