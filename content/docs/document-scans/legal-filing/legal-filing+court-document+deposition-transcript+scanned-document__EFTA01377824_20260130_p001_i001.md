ti- I/A 
The Registrant believes the offers, sales, and issuances of the above securities, including the transaction described under the title 
"Common Stock Issuances," were exempt from registration under the Securities Act by virtue of Section 4(a)(2), formerly 4(2), of 
the Securities Act, because the issuance of securities to the recipients did not involve a public offering, or were offered in reliance 
on Rule 701 because the transactions were pursuant to compensatory benefit plans or contracts relating to compensation as 
provided under such rule. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions represented their intentions to acquire the 
securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends 
were placed upon the stock certificates issued in these transactions. All recipients had adequate access, through their relationships 
with the Registrant or otherwise. to information about the Registrant. The sales of these securities were made without any general 
solicitation or advertising. 
Item 16. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. 
(a) Exhibits. 
We have filed the exhibits listed on the accompanying Exhibit Index of this Registration Statement. 
(b) Financial Statement Schedules. 
All financial statement schedules are omitted because the information called for is not required or is shown either in the 
consolidated financial statements or in the notes thereto. 
Item 17. Undertakings. 
The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting 
agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt 
delivery to each purchaser. 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, and 
controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or

otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is 
against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of 
the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person 
in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled 
by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against 
public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 
The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that: 
(1) 
For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of 
prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of 
prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed 
to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. 
(2) 
For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that 
contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered 
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
