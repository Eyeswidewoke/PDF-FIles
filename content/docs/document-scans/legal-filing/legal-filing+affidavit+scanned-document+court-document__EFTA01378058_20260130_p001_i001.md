Certain material United States federal income tax considerations for non-U.S. holders 
The following is a general discussion of material U.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to the ownership and disposition of our common stock 
applicable to non-U.S. holders who acquire such shares in this offering. This discussion is based on current provisions of the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations 
promulgated thereunder, and administrative rulings and court decisions in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change at any time, possibly 
with retroactive effect. 
For purposes of this discussion, the term "non-U.S. holder' means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a 
partnership or any of the following: 
a citizen or individual resident of the United States; 
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in the United States or under the 
laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 
an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source: or 
a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons 
have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S Treasury regulations to be 
treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a person 
treated as a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Persons that for U.S. federal income tax purposes 
are treated as a partner in a partnership holding shares of our common stock should consult their tax advisors. 
This discussion assumes that a non-U.S. holder holds shares of our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code 
(generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to a non-U.S. 
holder in light of that holders particular circumstances or that may be applicable to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law 
(including, for example. financial institutions, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment, insurance companies, tax-exempt 
entities, holders who acquired our common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, entities or arrangements 
treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders liable for the alternative minimum tax, certain former citizens or former long-term 
residents of the United States, holders who hold our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction, and holders who 
own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of our common stock (by vote or value)). In addition, this discussion does not address 
U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax, nor does it address any aspects of the unearned income Medicare 
contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2O10. or U.S. state, local or non-U.S. taxes. Accordingly, prospective 
investors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local. non-U.S. income and other tax considerations of acquiring, holding 
and disposing of shares of our common stock.
