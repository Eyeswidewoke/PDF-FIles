Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the 
ADB method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we calculate the FC on your Account by applying the 
Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) (inducing current transactions). To get the ADS, we (1) 
take the beginning balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous billing periods), (2) add any new 
transactions, debits or fees, (3) subtract any payments or credits cracked as of that day, and (4) make any appropriate 
adjustments. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the 
previous days daily balance multiplied by the DPR. This gives us the daily balance for that day and the beginning 
balance for the next dm/. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances 
for the biting period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the ADB. The ADS for 
a bang period w01 be considered zero if you paid the total New Balance, if any, shown on your previous biting 
statement by the Closing Date of the current billing period. If you multiply the ADB by the number of days in the billing 
period and the DPR, the result will be the FC assessed, except for variations caused by rounding. This method of 
calculating the ADB and FC results in daily compounding of FC. The information on page 2 of your statement
