FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
enjoyed by its neighbors over the past decade, a result 
of onerous regulation and weak productivity growth. 
We anticipate that this FDI gap will begin to close as 
2013's reforms bear fruit. 
Second, growth is set to be sharply stronger. Our 
economist has noted that the main reason behind the 
disappointing performance of Mexican manufacturing 
relative to the US this year was the lack of growth in 
high-value sectors to which the Mexican economy has 
become more sensitive. We do not anticipate this 
dynamic to continue. At the same time, the drag 
caused by last year's lack of government spending will 
end, with the IMF showing Mexico to possess one of 
the most positive fiscal impulses in EM next year. We 
therefore like to be long MXN against USD, targeting 
12.50. Given the positive outlook for oil production and 
FDI, we also like playing MXN strength against other oil 
producers, in particular COP and RUB. 
In contrast, the Brazilian real will likely face another 
challenging year. The current account has only 
improved modestly in spite of significant FX adjustment 
and the income balance remains a concern as a decade 
of large scale FDI inflows are 'paid back.' Moreover, 
while FX reserve coverage remains ample, the BCB has 
signaled it will adopt a more cautious stance over FX 
intervention over the course of the coming six months, 
as the central bank's swap book grows to up to 25% of 
total reserves. Finally, the upcoming election is unlikely 
to result an improvement in positive sentiment around 
the government's fiscal policies. We expect USD/BRL 
to trade in a high (2.25-2.50) range, ending the year at 
2.40. 
Regarding the Andeans, we foresee a difficult period 
for COP and a better backdrop for CLP and PEN. With 
respect to COP, the upcoming election year also 
represents a concern, with President Santos facing a 
strong challenge from the populist right. There are also 
question marks surrounding the outcome of peace 
negotiations with the FARC. Exports are expected to 
suffer as Venezuela's economic crises drags on. 
Combined with a muted outlook for oil prices, this 
suggests the COP will likely be the best short among 
Lat Am currencies next year. We like to play this versus 
a rather depressed CLP, which should benefit from a 
possible upturn in China and possible lower oil prices. 
PEN should also be helped by the uptick in growth 
(especially after last year's slowdown) and spillover 
effects 
from 
the 
expected 
increase in copper 
production. 
Altogether we like to be long MXN vs COP and RUB, 
long CLP 
vs 
COP, 
long 
PEN 
and 
see 
BRL 
underperforming the forwards while possibly trading in 
a 2.25-2.50 range.
