2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
Timothy Fitzgerald submitted an objection to Defendants on June 3, 2016, arguing, for 
reasons already discussed, that the warranty extension is not long enough. ECF No. 92-5 
Ex. 11. In the event the Court does not extend the warranty, Mr. Fitzgerald requests to be 
excluded from the N14 Class. Id. at 1. The Court grants this request. 
1. Objection of James. p38] M. Ward 
On June 13, 2016, James M. Ward filed an objection to the settlement, arguing that the 
settlement should include compensation for Class members who sold their Class Vehicles 
at a loss after repairing the engine. ECF No. 97. Mr. Ward seeks compensation for "all or 
part of the $18,559.43" price at which he bought his Class Vehicle. Id. at 1. Again, this 
objection ignores the reality that even non-defective cars decline in value after their 
purchase. As discussed, Mr. Ward is also entitled to reimbursement for repairs and 
replacements made on his Class Vehicle. 
m. Objection of Jamye C. Brown 
On June 20, 2016, Jamye C. Brown filed an objection to the settlement agreement, 
arguing again that the extended warranty is too short and does not cover her Class Vehicle 
and that the engine repair provision is unreasonable. ECF No. 96. Ms. Brown states that, 
in response to MINI's 2013 recall, she brought her vehicle to a "qualified Mini dealership," 
where the timing chain tensioner was repaired free of charge. See id. at 1, 5. Damage to 
the engine rendered the vehicle unusable, however, and Ms. Brown did not replace the 
engine because she would be entitled to reimbursement for only ten percent of the cost. 
See [*39] id. at 4, 5 (2009 model, 57,125 miles); ECF No. 92 at 13 (engine repair or 
replacement schedule). 
Again, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the reimbursement schedule and warranty 
limitation reflect a need to "draw the line" somewhere and the reality that vehicles decline 
in value over time. 
n. Objection of Gregory Munro 
On June 20, 2016, Gregory Munro filed an objection to the settlement. ECF No. 98. Mr. 
Munro, a law professor, argues that (a) the warranty extension is not long enough to 
provide relief to owners of old or high mileage Class Vehicles under the Magnuson-Moss 
Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2301 et seq., (b) there has been "inadequate discovery into the 
conduct of defendants" regarding the alleged defects and defendants' knowledge of the 
defects, and (c) the settlement does not include reimbursement for other expenses, 
including towing charges, travel expenses, and the cost of substitute vehicles, that might 
be available as "consequential damages" in a tort action. Id. at 1. Mr. Munro also argues 
that the settlement agreement "does not address" an allegedly defective oil system in the 
Class Vehicles "that may have been a substantial factor in the timing chain failures." Id. at 
4-5. 
Mr. Munro is correct that the owners of Class Vehicles [*40] who repaired or replaced 
failed engines or who sold their vehicles at a loss when the vehicles had certain 
combinations of mileage and age, see ECF No. 92 at 13, 14, are not entitled to 
compensation for the engine repairs or sales under the terms of the settlement. ECF No.
