IMPORTANT NOTICE OF MEMBERSHIP REWARDS® 
PROGRAM CHANGES 
Effective March 15, 2004, for each transfer of points into the 
Frequent Flyer program of a US airline, a fee of $0.0004 per 
point, with a maximum fee of $50, will be charged to your 
Card account. We charge this fee to offset the federal excise 
tax we must pay on such transfers. The fee may be more or 
less than the actual amount of the excise tax we pay on any 
individual transfer.

New in 2004, National lets Membership Rewards® enrollees
