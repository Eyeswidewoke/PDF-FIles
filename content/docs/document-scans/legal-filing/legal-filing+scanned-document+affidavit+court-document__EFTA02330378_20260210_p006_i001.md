Comparison with the =iterature 
Bone mass density 
Although moderate-intensity aerobic exercise =nterventions usually documented positive, but not statistically 
=ignificant, increases in bone mass[28]; =erschueren et al. 1151 =eported positive effects on hip BMD but not in total 
body or lumbar =pine BMD after 6 months of WBV using an up-and-down plate, lower =mplitudes (1.7-2.5 mm) and 
higher frequencies (35-40 =z) than the current study. However, these results reflected a similar =rend of adaptation to 
the current study. Russo et al[20] did =ot find any improvement in bone characteristics after 6 months of WBV =raining 
with a reciprocating plate with two sessions per week. =herefore, the number of sessions per week seems to play an 
important role to obtain the desired effect. 
Torvinen et al[3] =eported no effect on bones of healthy young adults after 8 months of =ertical WBV with 3-5 
sessions per week using a lower amplitude =2 mm), different frequencies (15-45 Hz) and a multidirectional =ibration 
exposure of the body by variation of body position on the =late. The variability of the program contributed to make 
standing on =he platform less monotonous, but distributed the mechanical strains in =ifferent body sites. Therefore, the 
lack of effects on bone in the =tudy reported by Torvinen et al[3] could =e explained partially because the study used 
lower vertical amplitudes =han the current study, which are associated to a less mechanical =mpact, and the number of 
mechanical strains were shared by more =natomical sites. In addition, the sample population was younger than =hat of 
the current study. 
On the other hand, the non-significance at the lumbar level =an be attributed to the partial knee flexion during 
the vibratory =xercise reducing the effects of the mechanical impact [3]. =evertheless, Rubin et al[18] found =reater 
strain in the vertical axis than in the lateral axis using =ifferent devices based on platforms oscillating the plate up-and-
down. =n contrast, the current study had higher lateral than vertical =cceleration by using a reciprocating plate that 
oscillated on a central =xis so that, when half of the platform is up the other half is down, =ausing a continuous balance 
of hips. 
Yamazaki et al[8] =emonstrated that moderate or walking exercise in postmenopausal women =ith 
osteopenia/osteoporosis maintained lumbar BMD via a suppression of =one turnover. Several studies showed that the 
effect of exercise on =umbar BMD in postmenopausal women seems to be quite modest (exercise =gt; 1% versus control 
< 1%)129] or =ven non-existent[30], and =he walking program of the current study did not induce any effect, =hich could 
be attributed, in part, to the better health status of the =ubjects of the current study (no case of 
=steopenia/osteoporosis). 
Balance 
Six-week WBV programs with =he use of a reciprocating plate at 3 sessions per week could reduce the =eclining 
balance in the elderly using 4-6 sets of 30-60 = at 35-40 Hz[10] or 4 =ets of 60 s at 10-26 Hz [16]. The =urrent 8-month 
trial showed that a vibrating exercise with a =eciprocating plate could improve balance in postmenopausal women. In 
=ontrast, studies of 8 months using an up-and-down plate did not show =ny improvement of balance[3]. This =ifference 
between devices could be explained, in part, because: a) the =alance and the strength of lower limbs declines with age, 
particularly =n the lateral direction[31], the =irection in which the reciprocating plate used in the current study =howed 
the greater mechanical acceleration; b) the studies differed in =he methodology of balance assessment. Therefore, 
further research is =equired to determine the adequate dose-response of vibration training =eeded to improve balance. 
Body mass =ndex 
The current =tudy reported a positive effect of WBV at 12.6 Hz on BMI compared to =alking group. This 
amelioration could be partly attributable to the =rend of the higher BMI of WBV group at baseline. Other previous study 
=id not find this positive effect (p < .05) on weight loss using WBV =t higher frequencies (25-45 Hz) compared to a 
control group =lthough they also found a trend of weight loss[3]. Other =uthors also reported that vibratory training at 
35-40 Hz was =ore effective to reduce fat mass than resistance training [15]. In =ontrast, another WBV at 35-40 Hz
