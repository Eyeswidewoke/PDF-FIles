No assurance can be given that the IRS will concur with the tax consequences set forth below. Each 
prospective investor is advised to consult its own tax and financial advisors as to the U.S. federal income 
tax consequences of an investment in the Access Fund and as to applicable state, local, estate, foreign or 
other tax laws. 
THIS SUMMARY IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS, 
LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE TO ANY PROSPECTIVE LIMITED PARTNER. PROSPECTIVE 
LIMITED PARTNERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT 
TO THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES AND ANY OTHER POTENTIAL 
TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCALITY OR OTHER 
RELEVANT TAXING JURISDICTION ARISING FROM THE ACQUISITION, HOLDING OR 
DISPOSAL OF INTERESTS. 
Status for U.S, Federal Income Tax Purposes. It is expected that the Access Fund and the Underlying 
Fund (together, the "Funds") each will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
As a partnership, a Fund generally will not be responsible for the payment of any U.S. federal income taxes 
associated with its operations (although it may be required to withhold or pay taxes under the BBA Rules 
or on behalf of its partners in certain circumstances). Instead, the taxable income or loss of a Fund for a 
taxable year (including the Access Fund's share of such items from the Underlying Fund) will pass through 
and be included in the computation of the taxable income and loss of the Limited Partners (subject to the 
limitations discussed below) regardless of whether a Fund distributes any amounts to its partners. 
Accordingly, it is possible that a Limited Partner will have a greater amount of taxable income allocable to 
it from the Access Fund for a taxable year than the amount of cash distributed to it from the Access Fund 
and may be required to pay taxes on its share of the Access Fund's taxable income using cash from other 
sources. 
A Fund could fail to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes in future years as a result 
of a variety of developments including, (i) modifications of the law governing the classification of entities 
as partnerships and (ii) characterization of a Fund as a "publicly traded partnership" as a result of the volume 
and nature of contributions of capital and redemptions and transfers of partnership interests. Failure to 
qualify as a partnership generally would result in a Fund's treatment as a corporation for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes. As a corporation, a Fund would generally be subject to an entity-level U.S. federal 
income tax, and all or a portion of its distributions (other than upon liquidation of a Fund or a partner's 
interests in the Fund) could be characterized as dividends. If a Fund was treated as a "publicly traded 
partnership," then it would be taxable as a corporation unless 90% or more of its gross income for each 
taxable year consisted of "qualifying income" including interest, dividends and gain from the sale of capital 
assets. If a Fund is mated as a "publicly traded partnership," we cannot assure you that the Fund would 
meet this 90% test. Thus, if a Fund is treated as a "publicly traded partnership," it may qualify as a 
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
In addition, while we expect that the Underlying Fund will qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income 
tax purposes as well, we can provide no assurance to this effect. Assuming the Underlying Fund is so 
treated, the Access Fund generally will be deemed to realize its pro rata sham of income, gain, deduction 
or loss realized by the Underlying Fund for such purposes. If instead the Underlying Fund was treated as 
a corporation for such purposes, each Limited Partner will bear its pro rata share of corporate taxes borne 
by the Underlying Fund. 
The following discussion assumes each Fund will qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes.
