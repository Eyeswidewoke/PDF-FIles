FBI Director Nominee Kash Patel Testifies at Confirmation Hearing 
Trump's FBI Chief Pick, Kash Patel, Insists He Has No 'Enemies List' and Won't Seek Retribution 
The Associated Press (01/30, Tucker, Richer, Brown) reported that Kash Patel, President Donald Trump's pick to lead 
the FBI, insisted to deeply skeptical Democrats on Thursday that he did not have an "enemies list" and that the 
Bureau under his leadership would not seek retribution against the president's adversaries or launch investigations 
for political purposes. The article quoted Patel, who said, "I have no interest, no desire and will not, if confirmed, 
go backwards. There will be no politicization at the FBI. There will be no retributive actions taken." The article 
stated that the reassurances were aimed at blunting a persistent line of attack from Democrats, who throughout 
the hearing confronted Patel with a vast catalog of prior incendiary statements on topics that they said made him 
unfit for the director's job and raised alarming questions about his belief in conspiracy theories and loyalty to the 
president. Patel, for his part, sought to distance himself from his own words, accusing Democrats of taking them 
out of context, highlighting only snippets, or misunderstanding his point. The New York Times (01/30, Goldman, 
Thrush, et al.) reported that in trying to distance himself from far-right associates and his own public statements, 
Patel went so far as to suggest he disagreed with Trump's decision to pardon Jan. 6 rioters who attacked law 
enforcement officials. It was a rare divergence from a president who selected him to run the nation's most 
powerful law enforcement agency. According to the article, Patel, who has repeatedly accused the Bureau's 
leadership of weaponizing its vast powers to target Trump, told the committee he believed that 98 percent of the 
FBI was made up of "courageous apolitical warriors for justice" who "just need better leadership." He did not 
explain how he determined that the other 2 percent, about 760 people out of a workforce of 38,000 employees, 
were supposedly partisan. Patel said his main goal as director would be to fight violent crime and protect the 
country from three principal national security threats — terrorism, Chinese espionage, and Iranian aggression. 
Politico (01/30, Cheney) reported that Patel repeatedly refused to say that Joe Biden won the 2020 election —
following similar refusals by Trump's nominee to be attorney general, Pam Bondi. "What's so hard about saying 
Biden won the 2020 election?" said Sen. Peter Welch (D-VT), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee 
convening Patel's confirmation hearing Thursday. "President Biden was certified and sworn in. I don't know how 
else to say it," Patel said. The article mentioned that Democrats have hammered Trump nominees over their refusal 
to acknowledge Biden's victory, saying it demonstrates an implicit unwillingness to adhere to facts and to put 
loyalty to Trump above telling the truth.
