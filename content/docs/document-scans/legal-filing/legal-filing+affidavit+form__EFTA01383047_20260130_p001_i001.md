GLDUS238 SOUTHERN FINANCIAL LLC 
Section 7: Risk Factors 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV. LP 
Risk Factors 
An investment in the Fund involves a substantial degree of risk and should be considered only by Investors whose 
financial resources are sufficient to enable them to assume such risk (and the possible loss of some or all of their 
investment) and who have no immediate need for liquidity in their investment. Investors should carefully evaluate the 
following Ask factors associated with an investment in the Fund. Past performance of the SOF Funds cannot be taken as 
an indication of the performance of the Fund. Investors should make their own assessment of the risks and rewards of 
an investment in the Fund. 
Pail A - Risks Related to an Investment in Secondary Private Equity 
Pooled investments in secondaries 
In many cases, the Manager expects that the Fund will have the opportunity to acquire a portfolio of investment funds or 
direct investments from a seller on an "all or nothing" basis. Certain of the investment funds or direct investments in the 
portfolio may be less attractive than others, and certain of the sponsors of such investment funds (or in some cases, the 
controlling investors in the portfolio companies) may be more familiar to the Manager than others, or may be more 
experienced or highly regarded than others. In such cases, it may not be possible for the Fund to carve out from such 
purchases those investments which the Fund considers (for commercial, tax, legal or other reasons) to be less attractive. 
Complex nature of due diligence and valuation process for GP-led Secondaries 
In traditional secondaries investments, secondaries investors typically provide liquidity to primary investors in private 
equity funds. and secondaries investors are able to rely on conducting due diligence on financial statements and periodic 
company updates originated by a common investment manager. By contrast, because many portfolios of direct 
investments being targeted by the Fund may be collections of the private equity assets of a seller other than private 
equity funds managed by a common investment manager, many GP-led Secondaries may lack the benefit of financial 
statements and periodic company updates that would be originated by a common investment manager. This may affect 
the ability of the Fund to conduct fundamental due diligence on the portfolio companies comprising such investment 
portfolios. 
Termination of the Fund's interest in an underlying fund 
The general partner or manager of an underlying fund may. among other things, terminate the Fund's interest in such 
underlying fund if the Fund fails to satisfy any capital call by that underlying fund or if the general partner or manager of 
that underlying fund determines that the continued participation of the Fund in the underlying fund would have a material 
adverse effect on the underlying fund or its assets. The Fund may tail to meet a capital call if an Investor fails to honor a 
capital call by the Fund and such shortfall cannot be made up by the other Investors, a new investor, a borrowing, the 
Manager or otherwise. 
Reliance on management of portfolio companies 
While d is the intent of the Fund to invest in underlying funds with proven investment fund managers and companies with 
proven operating management in place, there can be no assurance that such management will continue to operate 
successfully. Although the Fund will monitor the performance of each underlying fund and investment, it will rely upon 
management to operate the underlying funds and portfolio companies on a day-to-day basis.
