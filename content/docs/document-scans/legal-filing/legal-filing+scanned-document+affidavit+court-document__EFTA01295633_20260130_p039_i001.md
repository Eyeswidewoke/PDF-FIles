785 F.3d 895, "; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
discrimination." Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Watson, 487 U.S. at 990). For a 
nationwide class, Wal-Mart found that proving a consistent exercise of discretion will be 
difficult, if not impossible in some circumstances. Id.; see also Davis v. Cintas Corp., 717 
F.3d 476, 488 (6th Cir. 2013) (noting the difficulties Wal-Mart presents for parties seeking 
to certify a nationwide class). 
But [HN26] for a localized, circumscribed class of workers at a single facility, a policy of 
subjective, discretionary decision-making can more easily form the basis of Title VII 
liability, particularly when paired with a clear showing of pervasive racial hostility. In such 
cases, the underlying animus may help establish a consistently discriminatory exercise of 
discretion. 
This Court's recent opinion in Scott v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc. specifically provides 
several ways that such a disparate impact claim may satisfy Rule 23 after Wal-Mart, 
including: (1) when the exercise of discretion is "tied to a specific employment practice" 
that "affected the class in a uniform manner"; (2) when there is "also an allegation of a 
company-wide policy of discrimination" that affected [""53] employment decisions; and (3) 
'When high-level personnel exercise" the discretion at issue. Scott, 733 F.3d at 113-14. 
The first and second of Scott's alternatives are most relevant to this case. A specific 
employment practice or policy can comprise affirmative acts or inaction. Cf. Ellison v. 
Brady, 924 F.2d 872, 881 (9th Cir. 1991) (explaining an employer's responsibility to act to 
rectify a hostile or offensive work environment under Title VII). Regarding affirmative acts, 
the district court has established that Nucor's promotions practice provides that 
le]mployees in each of the production departments may bid on positions available in other 
departments," and that in order to promote one of the bidders, "the supervisor, the 
department manager, and the general manager must approve a written change of status 
and then submit the change of status form to the personnel office." J.A. 477-78. 
For purposes of class certification, the workers have provided sufficient evidence that such 
a policy, paired with the exercise of discretion by supervisors acting within it, created or 
exacerbated racially disparate results. The promotions system, requiring approvals from 
different levels of management, created an environment in which the discriminatory 
exercise of discretion by one [""54] department head harmed the promotions opportunities 
for all black workers at the plant by foreclosing on opportunities in that department and 
generally impeding upward mobility. Moreover, the disproportionate promotions of white 
workers had to be ratified by the general manager, Ladd Hall, who was thus on notice, or 
should have been on notice, that there were pronounced racial disparities in department-
level promotion practices, r9171 as indicated by the statistical and anecdotal evidence 
presented. 
The workers have also presented sufficient evidence of a practice of inaction by the 
general manager who ignored the evidence of, and complaints regarding, discrimination in 
promotions at the plant. See, e.g., J.A. 996-97, 1016, 1056, 1087, 1104. Such managerial 
inaction occurred despite Nucor's status as an "Equal Opportunity Employer" and its claim 
to have a "plantwide policy barring racial discrimination." Resp'ts' Br. 6. One black worker, 
Ray Roane, has testified that he complained directly to Hall about discrimination in 
promotions. J.A. 996-97. Hall threatened his job. J.A. 997. Consistent with that evidence, 
the workers observe in the context of their hostile work environment claim that [""55]
