The Olympics was merely the culminating=event, this came , after my winning many competitions in various 
=3B World Championships. Along my journey to the Olymp=cs , I had to pay , by earning, my own way, somet=mes 
only a couple of rubles at time. I set aside my aches and pains but co=tinued to visualize the spectators upside down , as 
I performed the =3B first, of many body flips, and drove on... 
I am now si=ting here at the Clifford Chance Law Office in Paris, where I am =working as an intern. In the 
evening, I now visualize myself be=ng in an amphitheater surrounded by a bouillabaisse of talented students f=om 
arund the world. As we listen to lectures by some of Harva=d's greatest legal minds I can hear the clicks of the laptop 
keyboards as =y fellow Harvard students refuse to look up at the professor as they belie=e it may cause them to 
mistakenly hit the wrong key .=/P> 
While trave=ing to foreign countries for training and competitions, I tried to visua=ize what it would be like to 
actually live in one. To my delight, at the=age of 16, I won a scholarship and was awarded a participation in a one-=ear 
exchange program in France. This experience was the first time=l had not only to compete, but had to do so in a 
language that w=s orthogonal to my native Russian. Luckily, now, in addition to French=and Russian I am also fluent in 
English and Norwegian. 
Motivated by my inte=est in international and legal affairs and in public speaking, I was acc=pted by the 
University of Paris to study law. The visualizations&n=sp; can sometimes be frightening. I remember with trepidation, 
on the =ery first day of class being sternly told that though we were now 2000 inc=ming students, we should be well 
aware that only 30= of us were expected to graduate. So I closed my eyes and began to=visualized myself as one of 
those lucky 300. 
=FONT size=3> As I push hard on t=e envelope of my future images I can see myself being an attorney=2C 
defending my clients, attempting to improve the =ives of those I represent. I believe that debating in a court is a=so a 
form of competition. It is even more rewarding than cheers from the c=owd. The competition of ideas and the search of 
compelling arguments require both skill and practice not unlike sports trai=ing. At trial ,small changes make large 
differences, just as in sports=tiny errors, might lead to a tragic injury. The legal system and the spo=t world look 
backward to precedent, though in sports we talk about break=ng one's own records as well as the world's best. I 
visualize doing both. =eing prepared for the unknown as I face new challenges. Following the rule= of the game I will 
push to the extremes - this time in the legal world. l=believe that law will enable me to do intellectually,=/SPAN> what 
snowboarding, has enabled me to do physically.=/P> 
=FONT size=3>While working 12 hou=s a day, I know that it is just another step in my training befo=e studying 
at HIS. This experience gives me an insight into the life of a =awyer, the opportunity to conduct due diligences and 
attend hearings. I =m particularly drawn to the challenges I find at the intersection of Inter=ational business law and 
arbitration.. 
Now I am practicing another visualiza=ion. This time I am standing on the stage, being handed my Law diploma 
b= the Dean. I can see and hear the Dean congratulating me. I look over , =nd again see my mother and father amongst 
other spectators, reac=ing their hands towards the sky. However this time they are all right side=up.
