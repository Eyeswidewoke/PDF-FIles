sufficient quantities of that product to meet our requirements, and we may experience a shortage of that product available for sale 
or distribution. The shortage of a popular product could materially and adversely affect our brand, our seller relationships, and the 
acquisition of additional sellers. If we overestimate demand for a particular product, we may experience excess inventory levels for 
that product and the excess inventory may become obsolete or out-of-date. Inventory levels in excess of demand may result in 
inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at further discounted prices, which could negatively impact our 
gross profit and our business. 
Our products and services may not function as intended due to errors in our software, hardware, and systems, or due to 
security breaches or human error in administering these systems, which could materially and adversely affect our 
business. 
Our software, hardware, and systems may contain undetected errors that could have a material adverse effect on our 
business, particularly to the extent such errors are not detected and remedied quickly. We have from time to time found

defects in our customer-facing software and hardware, internal systems, and technical integrations with third-party systems, and 
new errors may be introduced in the future. In addition, we provide frequent incremental releases of product and service updates 
and functional enhancements, which increases the possibility of errors. The electronic payments products and services we provide 
are designed to process complex transactions and deliver reports and other information related to those transactions, all at high 
volumes and processing speeds. Since customers use our services for important aspects of their businesses, any errors, defects, 
disruptions in services, or other performance problems with our services could hurt our reputation and damage our customers' 
businesses. Software and system errors, or human error, could delay or inhibit settlement of payments, result in oversettlement, 
cause reporting errors, or prevent us from collecting transaction fees, all of which have occurred in the past. Similarly, security 
breaches or errors in our hardware design or manufacture could cause product safety issues typical of consumer electronics 
devices. Such issues could lead to product recalls and inventory shortages, result in costly and time-consuming efforts to redesign 
and redistribute our products, give rise to regulatory inquiries and investigations, and result in lawsuits and other liabilities and 
losses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. 
Systems failures, interruptions, delays in service, catastrophic events, and resulting interruptions in the availability of our 
products or services could harm our business and our brand, and subject us to substantial liability. 
Our systems and those of our third-party data center facilities may experience service interruptions, denial-of-service and 
other cyber-attacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in 
telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical unrest, computer viruses, or 
other events. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully 
redundant, and our disaster-recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, 
we are subject to increased scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity and disaster recovery plans and 
more rigorous testing of such plans. This increased scrutiny may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from 
other business priorities. 
We have experienced and will likely continue to experience denial-of-service attacks. system failures, and other events or 
conditions that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have 
resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. In addition, they could result in significant expense to repair or replace damaged 
equipment and remedy resultant data loss or corruption. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the speed or 
other functionality of our products or services could materially harm our reputation and business. Frequent or persistent interruptions 
in our products and services could cause sellers to believe that our products and services are unreliable, leading them to switch to 
our competitors or to avoid our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and business. Moreover. to the 
extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to customers or their businesses, these customers could seek 
compensation from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to 
address. 
A significant natural disaster could have a material and adverse impact on our business. Our headquarters and certain of our 
data center facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. Despite any precautions we 
may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our headquarters or data centers could result in 
lengthy interruptions in our services or could result in related liabilities. We have implemented a disaster recovery program, which 
enables us to move production to a back-up data center in the event of a catastrophe.
