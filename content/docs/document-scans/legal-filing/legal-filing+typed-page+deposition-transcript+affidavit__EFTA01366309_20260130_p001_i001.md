rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cast requirement which 
may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business 
combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have 
offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not 
complete the initial business combination. 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by 
law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain 
stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will 
• conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation 
pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates 
the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer 
rules, and 
• file proxy materials with the SEC. 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial 
business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of 
common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. 
In such case, our initial stockholder has agreed to vote its founder 
shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in 
favor of our initial business combination and 
19 
our officers, directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote 
any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of 
our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect 
to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or 
against the proposed transaction. 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide 
that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that 
would cause our net tangible assets to be has than $5,000,001 (so 
that we are not subject to the SEC's "penny stock" rules). 
Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net 
tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement 
relating to our initial business combination. For example. the 
proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to 
be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the 
target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) 
the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with 
the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the 
aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all 
shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption 
plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the 
terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate 
amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business 
combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock 
submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
Limitation on redemption rights of 
stockholders holding more than 10% 
of the shares sold in this offering if 
we hold stockholder vote 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek 
stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business
