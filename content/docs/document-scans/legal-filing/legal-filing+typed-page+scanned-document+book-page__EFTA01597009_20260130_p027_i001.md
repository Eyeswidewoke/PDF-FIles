Individual Retirement Accounts 
The Agreements and Disclosures booklet contains the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements and 
the IRA Disclosure Statements that apply to any Traditional, Roth, SEP or SIMPLE Individual 
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you open with us now or in the future. If we make changes to 
the UBS IRA Custodial Agreement and the IRA Disclosure Statement we will send you 
updated documents, and you agree to be subject to those updated terms and conditions. 
According to the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements, UBS Financial Services Inc. is named as 
the custodian of your IRA when we accept the Account. At your death, the beneficiary or 
beneficiaries whose name(s) are shown on the Account Information pages of the 
Completing Your New Account Process package will become entitled to your IRA. 
Beneficiaries must be named in writing. Your written designation may apply to future 
accounts, and in that case, we will confirm your designation in the Completing Your 
Account Opening Process package. If you do not designate beneficiaries, or your 
beneficiary designation does not effectively dispose of the assets, your beneficiary with 
respect to the IRA or any part of the IRA not effectively disposed of, will be your surviving 
spouse, or your estate if you do not have a surviving spouse. You may be charged a 
Custodial Account fee in connection with this IRA. 
If this IRA account is funded via transfer from a non-UBS account, you represent that all 
transfers to this account originate from a same name inherited IRA of the same type 
indicated on this IRA Account Application (e.g., Traditional IRA, Roth IRA) and/or a direct 
rollover from a qualified plan which named you as beneficiary. 
Accounts with Cash Management Features 
The Agreements and Disclosures booklet contains the terms and conditions that apply to 
the cash management features you may select. All requests to enroll in cash management 
features are subject to approval. We consider your continued use of your Account as your 
acceptance of the applicable terms and conditions. 
There are important differences in the cash management features and other services that 
are available to U.S. residents through UBS accounts and those that are available to clients 
who reside outside the U.S. For example, we have different sweep programs for uninvested 
cash and different Card programs for these accounts. This agreement and the Agreements 
and Disclosures booklet describe which programs apply to which types of accounts. 
Verbal Authorization to Upgrade or Add Cash Management Features to an Account 
For any account you have with us now or may open in the future, we may accept verbal 
requests to upgrade or add cash management features to your Account. Generally, we 
permit any authorized person to provide verbal instructions to upgrade or add services to 
your Account unless you instruct us otherwise. In some circumstances, we may ask you or 
another person who is named on the account to sign additional documents or provide 
additional information for those additional features. We will provide you updated terms 
and conditions for the services you request if we have not already sent them to you or 
another owner of the Account. We consider your use of the Account as your acceptance of 
the applicable terms and conditions. 
Our Sweep Options and Your Sweep Election 
As a service to you, we offer options for the automatic investment or deposit of available 
cash balances ("sweep") in your Accounts. Current Sweep Options include the UBS Bank 
Sweep Programs and the Sweep Funds. The available Sweep Options and their features, 
and the eligibility of an Account for a specific Sweep Option varies by the type of Account 
you open, the services you select, the type of entity you are and your country of residence. 
We may change or discontinue our sweep service at any time, including adding or 
discontinuing specific Sweep Options. We may establish criteria for Sweep Options offered 
to different clients, including, but not limited to, establishing minimum asset requirements 
for clients to qualify for specific Sweep Options. 
You authorize and direct us to deposit or invest your available cash balances on each 
business day in your Sweep Option and to withdraw your funds from, or liquidate your 
The features and fees of your IRA are 
fully described in the Agreements 
and Disclosures booklet.
