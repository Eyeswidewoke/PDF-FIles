USA TODAY---Michael Wolff column on my book Annals of Unsolved Crime 
http://usat.ly/XMlj6w 
The mother's milk of media is crime. As news or as entertainment, =rime, preferably with a corpse, not only gets ratings 
but, in the way =t is pursued and resolved, reflects our sense of order and authority. 
Once upon a time, resolution and guilt were guaranteed. But in =ost-modern media, highly rated crimes, the ones that 
haunt both the =ews and the coolest dramas, are not resolved. Coverups don't bring =erpetrators down, they hold them 
up. 
In 1966, Edward Jay Epstein, a Cornell graduate student, published a =ook called Inquest. The book was a critique of the 
yet mostly admired =arren Commission report and, arguably, launched not only the industry =f doubt that continues to 
surround the Kennedy assassination but the =onspiracy culture that shadows most politics and provides grist for so =uch 
media. 
This week, in the 50th anniversary year of the JFK assassination, =pstein publishes a grand package of shadow and 
suspicion, The Annals =f Unsolved Crime. Such open cases — most left open because some =owerful person or entity did 
not want them closed — are the ones =hat certainly make the most compelling media. In fact, the book makes = good 
case that much of history is the product of greater and smaller =onspiracies. 
In Epstein's world, modern fiction, from the convenient murders in =etflix's House of Cards to virtually every cable series 
with a =efarious hero corrupting, plundering and murdering with a fair amount =f impunity, is just a minor adaptation of 
reality. 
Epstein himself is a grand figure of modern journalism, an =nvestigative journalist who has continued to socialize with 
and stay =n terms with the rich and powerful he investigates. It is their =ecrets, or at least the secrets of their lawyers 
and bankers, that he =ften reveals. His 15 books, including his investigations of the =iamond trade, Hollywood business 
practices, CIA moles and television =ews, are all about disabusing the notion that what we accept as true =ears much 
relationship to what is real. 
Show Epstein a juicy crime and he will show you how it has been =ubverted by unseen powers for their own agenda, by 
the inevitable =ncompetence of investigative authorities and by the media because it =ikes a simple story line. Oh yes, 
and add on top of that the =bfuscations of amoral governments, the tradecraft of ubiquitous =ecurity and intelligence 
services, and the brutal efficiency of =rganized crime rings. 
Most recently, smelling a rat, the ever-freelance Epstein took it upon =imself to reinterpret the pursuit and investigation 
of former =nternational Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, arrested in =ew York for allegedly sexually 
assaulting a hotel maid. His methodical =econstruction of everybody's footsteps not only uncovered videotape 
=urveillance implicating the French government in an effort to bring =own Strauss-Kahn, but rewrote the entire 
narrative of the ultimate =ncounter with the hotel maid in New York. 
Epstein doesn't so much solve crimes as make them more complicated. It =s not a question with Epstein of guilt or 
innocence, but of cause and =ffect. In this, Epstein diverges from most conspiracists who come =fter him. He has no 
politics nor agenda. He is not so much angry about =he general miscarriages of justice, but pleased to be able to see 
=hrough them. 
His new book is a mix of current headlines, from Strauss-Kahn to Amanda =nox to the 2006 assassination of Alexander 
Litvinenko in London by =adioactive isotopes, and historical holdovers, from the Lincoln =ssassination to the Lindbergh 
kidnapping and Jack the Ripper. His =oint being: It has always been thus. Power, media and incompetence =eliably 
combine to create convenient resolutions and substantially =ntrue stories. 
For Epstein, who was once novelist Vladimir Nabokov's assistant, there =s really no aha! moment; there is only a peeling 
back of the onion, something else revealed, some other avenue to go down — a kind of =ver-advancing new season of 
narrative.
