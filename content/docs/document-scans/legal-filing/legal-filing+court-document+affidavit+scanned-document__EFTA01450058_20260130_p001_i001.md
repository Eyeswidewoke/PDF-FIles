Section 2(a)(iii)) and (b) the option rights of the parties in respect of that Terminated Transaction or group of 
Terminated Transactions. 
Any Close-out Amount will be determined by the Determining Party (or its agent), which will act in good faith and 
use commercially reasonable procedures in order to produce a commercially reasonable result. The Determining 
Party may determine a Close-out Amount for any group of Terminated Transactions or any individual Tenninated 
Transaction but, in the aggregate. for not less than all Terminated Transactions. Each Close-out Amount will be 
determined as of the Early Termination Date or, if that would not be commercially reasonable, as of the date or dates 
following the Earl• Termination Date as would be commercially reasonable. 
Unpaid Amounts in respect of a Tenninated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions and legal fees and out-
of-pocket expenses referred to in Section 11 are to be excluded in all determinations of Close-out Amounts. 
In determining a Close-out Amount, the Determining Party may consider any relevant information, including, without 
limitation. one or more of the following types of information:—
(i) 
quotations (either firm or indicative) for replacement transactions supplied by one or more third parties that 
may take into account the creditworthiness of the Determining Party at the time the quotation is provided and the 
terms of any relevant documentation including credit support documentation between the Determining Party and the 
third party providing the quotation: 
(ii) 
information consisting of relevant market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties 
including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other 
relevant market data in the relevant market: or 
(iii) 
information of the types described in clause (i) or (ii) above from internal sources (including any of the 
Determining Party's Affiliates) if that information is of the same type used by the Determining Party in the regular 
course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions. 
The Determining Party will consider, taking into account the standards and procedures described in this definition, 
quotations pursuant to clause (i) above or relevant market data pursuant to clause (ii) above unless the Determining 
Party masonably believes in good faith that such quotations or relevant market data arc not readily available or would 
produce a result that would not satisfy those standards. When considering information described in clause (i), (ii) or 
(iii) above, the Determining Party may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding arc not and would not 
be a component of the other information being utilised. Third parties supplying quotations pursuant to clause (i) 
above or market data pursuant to clause (ii) above may include. without limitation dealers in the relevant markets, 
end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information. 
Without duplication of amounts calculated based on infonnation described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, or other 
relevant information, and when it is commercially reasonable to do so. the Determining Party may in addition 
consider in calculating a Close-out Amount any loss or cost incurred in connection with its terminating, liquidating or 
re-establishing any hedge related to a Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions (or any gain 
resulting from any of them). 
Commercially reasonable procedures used in determining a Close-out Amount may include the following:—
(1) 
application to relevant market data from third parties pursuant to clause (ii) above or infonnation from 
internal sources pursuant to clause (iii) above of pricing or other valuation models that are, at the time of the 
determination of the Close-out Amount, used by the Determining Party in the regular course of its business in pricing 
or valuing transactions between the Determining Party and unrelated third panics that are similar to the Terminated 
Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions; and
