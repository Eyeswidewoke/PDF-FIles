(B) 
if no other security or obligation of the Obligor or its guarantor is 
rated by S&P or Moody's, then the Collateral Manager may apply to S&P for a 
S&P credit rating estimate, which will be its S&P Rating provided that pending 
such application the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation will be deemed to 
be "CCC+" if the Collateral Manager reasonably believes that the appropriate 
credit rating is "CCC+" or greater, or otherwise "CCC-"; provided, however, that 
if the S&P credit estimate actually assigned to any obligation that had been 
deemed to have an S&P Rating of "CCC+" pursuant to this provision pending 
such estimate is lower than "CCC+", thereafter the S&P Rating of any obligation 
pending assignment of a credit estimate shall be "CCC-"; or 
(C) 
if such Collateral Obligation is not rated by Moody's or S&P, no 
other security or obligation of the Obligor or its guarantor is rated by S&P or 
Moody's and if the Collateral Manager determines in its sole discretion based on 
information available to it after reasonable inquiry that such Obligor (x) is not 
subject to any bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings nor in default on any of 
its obligations, (y) is a legally constituted corporate entity having the minimum 
legal, financial and operational infrastructure to carry on a definable business, 
deliver and sell a product or service and report its results in generally accepted 
accounting terms as verified by a reputable audit firm and (z) is not so vulnerable 
to adverse business, financial and economic conditions that default in its financial 
or other obligations is foreseeable in the near term if current operating trends 
continue, then the S&P Rating will be "CCC-"; provided that the Collateral 
Manager must request from S&P an S&P credit rating on such Obligor within 30 
days after the addition of the relevant Collateral Obligation; provided, further, 
that Collateral Obligations constituting no more than 5% of the Collateral 
Principal Amount may be given an S&P Rating based on this subclause (C) (after 
giving effect to the addition of the relevant Collateral Obligation, if applicable); 
provided that if (i) the relevant Obligor or guarantor or obligation is placed on any positive 
"credit watch" list by S&P, such rating will be increased by one rating subcategory or (ii) the 
relevant Obligor or guarantor or obligation is placed on any negative "credit watch" list by S&P, 
such rating will be decreased by one rating subcategory; 
provided fluffier that with respect to any Collateral Obligation or Reference Obligation to which 
clause (B) and (C) above are applicable or for which a credit estimate was obtained, for so long 
as any Notes remain Outstanding, prior to or immediately following the acquisition of any such 
Collateral Obligation, and on or prior to each one-year anniversary of the acquisition of any such 
Collateral Obligation, the Issuer shall submit to S&P a request to perform a credit estimate on 
such Collateral Obligation, together with all information reasonably required by S&P to perform 
such credit estimate. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Collateral Obligation that is (A) a 
DIP Loan, the S&P Rating shall be (1) the rating assigned thereto by S&P if the rating is public, 
(2) the rating assigned by S&P if the rating is confidential, but only if all appropriate parties have 
provided written consent to its disclosure and use, (3) the rating assigned by S&P thereto through
