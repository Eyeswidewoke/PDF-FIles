Adjustments to cost basis can be made after year-end, in particular, for return of capital adjustments, but may also include adjustments for corporate action events. Therefore there may be differences in cost basis

the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those involving foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with less 
than one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns.

market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds credited to your brokerage account. Please see the 
money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit products disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional information. Pursuant to SEC Rule lob-10(b)(1) confirmations are
