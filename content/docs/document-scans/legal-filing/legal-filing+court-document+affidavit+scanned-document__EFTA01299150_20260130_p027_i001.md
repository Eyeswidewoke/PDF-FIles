509 F. Supp. 815, *; 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11119, **; 
1981-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P64,165 
5. There are no class action allegations contained in the Amended Complaint. 
The hospitals involved in this action furnish medical care and services to the community in 
a variety of ways: by caring for patients, training doctors and staff personnel, developing 
research facilities, and extending staff privileges to private physicians. Much of this activity 
happens to spill across the boundaries of Florida and into the stream of interstate 
commerce. 
It is this activity of providing medical care to patients that the defendants allegedly ["13] 
seek to exclude plaintiff from participation and involvement. It is this activity that must be 
connected with interstate commerce in order to sustain jurisdiction. Plaintiff must establish 
that the medical services supplied by the defendants have the required effect on interstate 
commerce. He is not required to show that the alleged conspiratorial actions of the 
defendants have any connection with interstate commerce. To rule otherwise would vitiate 
the intended scope of the law and impose an insuperable burden upon a plaintiff alleging 
an anticompetition conspiracy. Such a conspiracy would seldom reach interstate 
proportions though the object of the conspiracy might be federal in scope. 
The Court's conclusion that the Amended Complaint is jurisdictionally sound is supported 
by the recent decision of McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, 444 U.S. 232, 100 
S. Ct. 502, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1980), in which the Supreme Court held that the district court 
erred in dismissing a complaint which alleged a price fixing conspiracy involving several 
Louisiana real estate brokerage firms. The Court stated that the plaintiff could establish 
the requisite jurisdiction under the Sherman r*14] Act by demonstrating that a substantial 
effect on interstate commerce was generated by the defendants' brokerage activities. 
Referring specifically to the requirement that plaintiff must allege a relationship between 
the activity involved and some aspect of interstate commerce, the Court observed: 
To establish the jurisdictional element of a Sherman Act violation it would be sufficient for petitioners to demonstrate a 
r821] substantial effect on interstate commerce generated by respondents' brokerage activity. Petitioners need not 
make the more particularized showing of an effect on interstate commerce caused by the alleged conspiracy to fix 
commission rates. or by those other aspects of respondents' activity that are alleged to be unlawful. The validity of this 
approach is confirmed by an examination of the case law. If establishng juisdiction required a shoving that the 
unlawful conduct itself had an effect on interstate commerce, jurisdiction would be defeated by a demonstration that the 
alleged restraint failed to have its intended artioompeblhe effect. ilia is not the rule of our cases. See American 
Tobacco Co. v. United States. 328 U.S. 781.811.66S. rim Ct. 1125. 1139. 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946): Urited States v 
Socony Vacuum Oil Co.. 310 U.S. 150. 225. n. 59. 60 S. Ct. 811. 846. 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940).... 
Id. 100 S. Ct. at 509. 
Defendants have cited several cases in their memoranda which would appear to support 
dismissal of the Amended Complaint: Wolf v. Jane Phillips Episcopal Memorial Medical 
Center, 513 F.2d 684 (10th Cir. 1975); Riggall v. Washington County Medical Society, 249 
F.2d 266 (8th Cir. 1957); Spears Free Clinic and Hospital v. Cleere, 197 F.2d 125 (10th 
Cir. 1952). These cases all involved dismissals of complaints for defective jurisdictional 
allegations under the Sherman Act in situations similar to that now before this Court. The 
dismissed antitrust complaints in the cases cited appear to involve only general 
jurisdictional allegations devoid of the specificity contained in plaintiff's Amended 
Complaint. Furthermore, these cases explicitly reject the analysis described above which 
links jurisdiction to the stream of interstate commerce by focusing upon the interstate
