EM Currency Handbook 2018: Still Fuel in the Tank 
Romania 
The leu was introduced in 1867. Romania left the gold 
standard in 1914 and the leu's value fell. A revaluation 
took place on August 15, 1947. replacing the old leu at 
a rate of 20,000 old lei = 1 new leu. At the time of its 
introduction, 150 new lei equalled 1 USD. On January 
28, 1952. another new leu was introduced. Unlike the 
previous revaluation, different rates were employed for 
different kinds of exchange (cash, bank deposits, debts 
etc.) and different amounts. These rates ranged from 20 
to 400 "old lei" for 1 "new" leu. From 1994 to 1997 the 
leu was freely-floating before becoming a managed 
float against USD and baskets of EUR and USD. At the 
end of October 2004, the National Bank of Romania 
(NBR) abandoned the basket and moved to a more 
flexible exchange rate. On 1st July 2005 the leu was 
redenominated, with the old ROL being converted to 
RON at a rate of 1 RON = 10,000 ROL. On 1st 
September 2006, the NBR eliminated the remaining 
capital controls and completed the liberalisation of the 
capital account. 
Romania joined the EU in 2007 and therefore has a 
commitment to join the Euro at an unspecified future 
date. In order to enter the Eurozone, all five Maastricht 
criteria must be met including the commitment to enter 
ERM-II and maintain EUR/RON +/-15% around a 
selected "parity" rate for at least 2 years. 
The NBR is run by the Board of Directors, which 
consists of nine members and is led by a Governor. The 
NBR moved to direct inflation targeting in 2005. The 
inflation target has been 2.5% with a +/- 1% variation 
band since 2013. 
The exchange rate regime of the leu currently in place 
is that of a managed float, in line with using inflation 
targets as a nominal anchor for monetary policy. 
The leu is both fully deliverable and convertible. Spot is 
liquid in both USD/RON and EUR/RON but EUR/RON is 
viewed as the economically correct way to take a view 
on the leu.
