Tax Considerations 
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 
The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, 
holding and disposing of Interests in the Onshore Feeder Fund by U.S. Holders (as defined 
herein) and of Interests in the Offshore Feeder Fund by U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors (as 
defined herein) and Non-U.S. Holders (as defined herein) who purchase their respective 
interests in the offering. This summary is based upon the Code, U.S. Department of the 
Treasury ("U.S. Treasury Department") regulations promulgated thereunder, published 
rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), court decisions and other applicable 
authority, all as in effect on the date of this Memorandum and all of which are subject to 
change or different interpretations (possibly on a retroactive basis). This summary does 
not purport to address all U.S. federal income tax matters that may be relevant to a 
particular investor and, except where clearly indicated otherwise, does not address 
Investors with special circumstances, such as a controlled foreign corporation, a passive 
foreign investment company, or an individual who is a U.S. expatriate and, therefore, 
subject to special treatment under the Code. This discussion and the discussion of tax 
considerations under "ERISA Considerations" have been written to support the marketing 
of investments in the Onshore Feeder Fund and the Offshore Feeder Fund. It was not 
intended or written to be used, and cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of 
avoiding U.S. federal income tax penalties. Prospective investors are urged to consult 
their tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local, foreign income and other 
tax consequences to them of acquiring, holding and disposing of Interests. 
For purposes of this summary, a "U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of an interest in the 
Onshore Feeder Fund or Offshore Feeder Fund that is, for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes, a citizen or resident of the United States, a U.S. domestic corporation or 
otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis with respect to its 
interest. The tax treatment of persons who hold interests through a partnership (including 
an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) generally will 
depend upon certain factors, including the activities of the partnership. Partners in a 
partnership holding interests should consult their tax advisors. A "Non-U.S. Holder" 
means any Investor that is not a U.S. Holder. 
The Onshore Feeder Fund 
Onshore Feeder Fund Status. The Onshore Feeder Fund intends to operate as a 
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not a publicly traded partnership 
taxable as a corporation. The Onshore Feeder Fund's only investment will be in the Master 
Fund, which is also treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
Taxation of Investors on Onshore Feeder Fund Profits and Losses. The Onshore 
Feeder Fund itself generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, and the 
characterization of an item of profit or loss generally will be determined at the Onshore 
Fund (rather than at the Investor level). Each Investor in computing its U.S. federal income 
tax liability for a taxable year will be required to take into account its allocable share of all
