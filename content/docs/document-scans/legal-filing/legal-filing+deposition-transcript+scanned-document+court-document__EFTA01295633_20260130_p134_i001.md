2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
deceptive action, a "plaintiff need not show the act in question was intended to deceive, 
only that it had the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public." Panag v. 
Farmers Ins. Co. of Wash., 166 Wn.2d 27, 204 P.3d 885, 899 (Wash. 2009). Although the 
Washington Supreme Court has not provided an explicit definition for "unfair acts," Klem, 
295 P.3d at 1187, it has held that "an act is unfair if it . . . is unethical, oppressive, or 
unscrupulous," id. at 1186. One federal interpretation, to which Washington courts 
interpreting the CPA may look for guidance, states that a "practice is unfair if it causes or is 
likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by 
consumers themselves and is not outweighed by countervailing benefits." Id. 
Mr. Steadman contends that Green Tree's initiation of foreclosure r39] proceedings was 
deceptive because it misrepresented that Mr. Steadman had defaulted on his loan 
payments. (Resp. at 18.) Mr. Steadman also contends that Green Tree's failure to help him 
finalize and process a loan modification to which Mr. Steadman's previous servicer had 
agreed was unscrupulous. (Resp. at 19.) Because the CPA is to "be liberally construed 
that its beneficial purposes may be served," RCW 19.86.920, the court concludes that Mr. 
Steadman's allegations adequately support a finding of a deceptive or unfair trade 
practice." 
11 Ordinarily. whether undisputed conduct is unfair or deceptive is a question of law, not a question of fact. Lyons v. U.S. Bank 
Net. Ass'n. 181 Wn.2d 775. 336 P.3d 1142. 1148 (Wash. 2014). However. where the allegedly deceptive conduct is disputed. 
the material questions of fact must be resolved by a factfinder. Id Here. Green Tree disputes Mr. Steadman's allegations.
Therefore, whether GreenTree's conduct was unfair or deceptive is a question for the trier of fact. See id.: see also 6A Wash. 
Prac.. Wash. Pattern Jury Instr. Civ. WPI 310.08 (6th ed.) (setting forth the definition of an unfair or deceptive act or practice for 
the jury's determiretion). 
Next, the court finds that Mr. Steadman has adequately raised a material issue of fact 
regarding r40] damages. Under the CPA, "the injury requirement is met upon proof the 
plaintiffs property interest or money is diminished because of the unlawful conduct. Panag, 
204 P.3d at 899. Additionally, "plaintiff must establish that, but for the defendant's unfair or 
deceptive practice, the plaintiff would not have suffered an injury." Indoor BillboarcWVash., 
Inc. v. Integra Telecom of Wash., Inc., 162 Wn.2d 59, 170 P.3d 10, 22 (Wash. 2007). 
Personal injuries such as "mental distress, embarrassment, and inconvenience are not 
recoverable under the CPA." Panag, 204 P.3d at 899. 
Here, Mr. Steadman testifies that he has been charged default fees and foreclosure fees 
as a result of Green Tree's allegedly invalid foreclosure on his property that he would not 
have been charged otherwise. (See Steadman Decl. at 3.) "The injury element will be met 
if the consumers property interest or money is diminished because of the unlawful conduct 
even if the expenses caused by the statutory violation are minimal." Mason v. Mort. Am., 
Inc., 114 Wn.2d 842, 792 P.2d 142, 148 (Wash. 1990). Because Mr. Steadman provides 
evidence that his money has been diminished because of Green Tree's allegedly unlawful 
conduct, there is a question of fact regarding this element. Therefore, summary judgment 
on Mr. Steadman's CPA claim is inappropriate.'2
12 In support of his CPA claim. Mr. Steadman attaches as evidence six consumer complaints filed with Ng the Washington 
State Attorney General against Green Tree for failing to credit loan modifications entered into prior to assignment. (See Box 
Decl. Ex. 3.) Green Tree moves to strike this evidence as unauthenticatecl, hearsay, and impermissible character evidence.
