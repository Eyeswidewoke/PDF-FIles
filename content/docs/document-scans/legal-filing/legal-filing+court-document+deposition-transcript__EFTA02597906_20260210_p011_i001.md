Shares (or such lesser number as are validly tendered at prices =ot greater than $55.00 nor less than $50.00 per Share) 
pursuant to the Offer. =he Offer is not conditioned upon any minimum number of Shares being tendered. =he Offer is, 
however, subject to certain other conditions. See Section 6. The Company reserves the right to purchase more than 
15,000,000 Shares pursuant=to the Offer, but does not currently plan to do so. 
4 
In accordance with Instruction 5 of the Letter of Transmittal, each stockholder who wishes to tender Shares must specify 
the price (not greater than $55.00 nor less than $50.00 per Share) at which such stockholder is willing to have the 
Company purchase such Shares. As promptly as practicabl= following the Expiration Date, the Company will determine 
the Purchase Pric= (not greater than $55.00 nor less than $50.00 per Share) that it will pay f=r Shares validly tendered 
pursuant to the Offer, taking into account the numb=r of Shares so tendered and the prices specified by tendering 
stockholders. A=l Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer will be purchased at the Purchase Price. All Shares not 
purchased pursuant to the Offer, including Shares tendered at prices greater than the Purchase Price and Shares not 
purchased because of proration, will be returned to the tendering stockholders at the Company's expense as promptly 
as practicable following the Expiration D=te. 
If not more than 15,000,000 Shares (or such greater number of Shares as the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect 
to purchase pursuant to the Offe=) are validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, the Company 
will purchase all such Shares. 
If more than 15,000,000 Shares (or such greater number of Shares as the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to 
purchase pursuant to the Offe=) have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, =he 
Company will purchase up to a maximum of 15,000,000 Shares (or any such greater number designated by the 
Company), upon the terms and subject to th= conditions of the Offer, in the following order of priority: 
(a) all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date by any stockholder who owned 
beneficially an aggregate of fewer than 100 Shares as of the close of business on May 3, 1999 and who validly tenders all 
of such Shares (partial tenders will not qualify for this preference) and completes the box captioned "Odd Lots" on the 
Let=er of Transmittal and, if applicable, on the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery (see 
Section 2); and 
(b) after purchase of all of the foregoing Shares, all other Shares validly tendered at or below the Purchase Price and not 
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, on a pro rata basis, if necessary (with appropriate adjustments to avoid 
purchases of fractional Shares). 
The Company does not expect that it will be able to announce the final proration factor or to commence payment for 
any Shares purchased pursuant t= the Offer until approximately five NYSE trading days after the Expiration Date, if 
proration of tendered Shares is required, because of the difficult= in determining the number of Shares validly tendered 
(including Shares tendered pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedure described in Section=3) and not withdrawn 
prior to the Expiration Date and as a result of the "=odd lot" procedure described in Section 2. Preliminary results of 
proratio= will be announced by press release as promptly as practicable after the Expirati=n Date. Holders of Shares may 
obtain such preliminary information from the Dealer Managers or the Information Agent and may also be able to obtain 
suc= information from their brokers. 
The Company expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, at any time or from time to time, to extend the period of 
time during which the Of=er is open by giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositar=. See Section 14. 
There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will exercise its right to extend the Offer. If the Company 
decides, in its sole discretion, to increase (except for any increase not in excess of 2% of the outstanding Shares) or 
decrease the number of Shares being sought or to increase or decrease the consideration offered in the Offer to holders 
of Shares and, at the time that notice of such increase or decrease is first published, sent or given to holders of Shares in
