2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87203, * 
In the context of government attorneys, the "work-product privilege applies to . 
discussions between prosecutors and investigating ri7] agents, both state and federal." 
United States v. Zingsheim, 384 F.3d 867, 872 (7th Cir. 2004) (citing FTC v. Grolier Inc., 
462 U.S. 19, 103 S. Ct. 2209, 76 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1983)). 
The work-product privilege extends only to documents that an attorney prepares "in 
anticipation of litigation." Fed. R. C iv. P. 26(a)(3)(A). Petitioners argue that the work-
product privilege does not apply to the submitted documents because they were not 
prepared "in anticipation of [the instant] CVRA litigation." (DE 265 at 7). Retreating 
somewhat from this initial assertion, Petitioners argue that "[m]any of the documents at 
issue here were not prepared in anticipation of litigation, and certainly not in anticipation of 
the litigation about the Crime Victims' Rights Act." (Id.). 
Although "[s]ome older cases took the position that the work-product immunity applied only 
to documents prepared in direct relation to the case at bar," 8 Wright, Miller & Marcus, 
Fed. Prac. & Fed. P. § 2024, p. 518 (3d ed. 2010), more recent cases "have generally 
found that documents produced in anticipation of litigating one case remain protected in a 
subsequent case[] if they were created by or for a party to the subsequent litigation," 
Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 248 F.R.D. 663, 668 (N.D. Ga. 2008). 
These cases rely on the Supreme Court's dicta in Federal Trade Communication v. 
Grolier, Inc., that "the literal language of [Rule 26(b)(3)] protects materials prepared for any 
litigation risi or trial as long as they were prepared by or for a party to the subsequent 
litigation." 462 U.S. 19, 25, 103 S. Ct. 2209, 76 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1983) (emphasis in original); 
see also 8 Wright, Miller & Marcus, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P. § 2024, p. 519 n.47 (3d ed. 2010) 
(collecting cases). Similarly, the work-product doctrine applies regardless of whether 
litigation actually ensued, so long as it can be fairly said that the document was prepared 
or obtained because of the prospect of litigation. See Kent Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 530 F.2d 
612, 623 (5th Cir. 1976) (holding that agency documents produced when deciding "to 
prosecute or not to prosecute" were protected work product, regardless of 'whether 
litigation actually ensured"). 
After its in camera review, the Court finds that the majority of work-product documents 
identified by the Government were prepared or obtained by the Government because of 
the reasonable prospect of litigating a criminal case against Epstein. (DE 212-1 at 1-21; 
DE 216-1 at 1-12; DE 329-1 at 1-18).' This CVRA litigation and the underlying criminal 
investigation are integrally related, and the work-product doctrine protects from discovery 
materials prepared in anticipation of either in the instant litigation. 
4 The Government asserts that the work•product doctrine applies to documents prepared by ('191 attorneys in the Department 
of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) in response to Petitioners' counsel's request for an investigation into the 
Government's handling of the Epstein case (DE 276-1 at 12-14). Although these doctrnents were prepared by Government 
attorneys, the Government has not demonstrated that they were prepared "in anticipation of litigation or for trial" so as to be 
protected work product. Fed. R. Cry. P. 26(b)(3)(A). As discussed in the next section, however, the Court has thoroughly 
reviewed these documents and finds that they are not relevant. or likely to lead to materials relevant to the instant CVRA 
litigation. (See infra Sect. 8.3.) 
Petitioners argue that the work-product doctrine "does not apply" in this case for two 
additional reasons. First, they argue that the doctrine does not apply in a case brought by 
crime victims against the federal prosecutors who were bound to protect their rights under
