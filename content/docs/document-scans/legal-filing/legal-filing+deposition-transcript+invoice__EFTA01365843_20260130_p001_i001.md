6. Joint Ventures 
Mexko 
On July I, 2014. the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with S.A. de C.V. , a non-related party. to form IV Churrascaria Mexico. 
S. de R.L. de C.V. (the "Minajaro IV). (the "Parties"), for the purposes of jointly developing, constructing and operating Brazilian style 
steakhouses under the "Pogo de Chao" name in certain locations in Mexico. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement. the Company owns 51% of 
the ownership interests in the joint venture and is entitled to receive 50% of the profits of the joint venture after the Parties recoup their initial 
contributions. The Company is also entitled to a license fee equal to a percentage of the annual gross revenue of each restaurant developed, 
constructed or operated by the Minajaro IV. 
The Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the joint venture since the Company will have the power to direct activities that 
significantly impact the entity on a day-to-day basis. These activities include, but are not limited to having an affirmative vote over key operating 
decisions of the joint venture. Upon formation of the joint venture, the Company has the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity 
("VIE") that could potentially be significant to the VIE, and the Losses/Benefits Criterion, as defined in the joint venture agreement. is satiered. 
The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include any amounts of revenue or income from operations of its Mexico joint 
venture, as the construction of restaurants included in the joint venture are currently in process. All losses from the Minajaro .111 have been 
allocated to the Company's joint venture partner in accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreement. The assets of the consolidated joint 
venture are restricted for use only by the joint venture and are not available for the Company's general operations. As of March 29, 2015. all net 
assets of the Minajaro JV have been contributed and are owned by the Company's joint venture partner and, as a result, have been allocated to the 
noncontrolling interest in the Minajaro
