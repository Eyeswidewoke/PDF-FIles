> I suspect that it is possible that the Church Turing thesis is also a =hysical law, i.e. it is impossible to build physical 
computer that can =alculate more than a Turing machine. However, that conflicts with the =raditional intuitions of most 
of physics: that the universe is =eometric, i.e. hypercomputational. The fact that we cannot construct a =ypercomputer, 
not just not in physics, but also not mathematically =where we take its existence as given when we perform geometry), 
makes =e suspect that perhaps even God cannot make a true geometric universe. 
> How can we recover continuous space from discrete computation? Well, =pacetime is the set of all locations that can 
store information, and =he set of all trajectories along which this information can flow, as =een from the perspective of 
an observer. We can get such an arrangement =rom a flat lattice (i.e. a graph) that is approximately regular and =ine 
grained enough. If we disturb the lattice structure by adding more =inks, we get nonlocality (i.e. some information 
appears in distant =attice positions), and if we remove links, we get spatial superposition =some locations are not 
dangling, so we cannot project them to a single =oordinate any more, but must project them into a region). 
> On the elementary level, we can define a space by using a set of =bjects, and a bijective function that maps a scalar 
value to a subset =f these objects. The easiest way of doing might be to define a typed =elationship that orders each pair 
of objects, and differences in the =calar are mapped to the number of successive links of that relationship =ype. We can 
use multiple relationship types to obtain multiple =imensions, and if we choose the relationships suitably we may also 
=onstruct operators that relate the dimensions to each other via =ranslation, rotation and nesting, so we derive the 
properties of =uclidean spaces. 
> To get to relativistic space, we need to first think about how =nformation might travel through a lattice. If we just 
equalize value =ifferentials at neighboring locations, we will see that the information =issipates quickly and won't travel 
very far. To transmit information =ver large distances in a lattice, it must be packaged in a way that =reserves the value 
and a momentum (in the sense of direction), so we =an discern its origin. A good toy model might be the Game of Life 
=utomaton, which operates on a regular two dimensional lattice and =llows the construction of stable, traveling 
oscillators (gliders). In =ame of life, only the immediate neighbor locations are involved, so =liders can only travel in very 
few directions. A more fine grained =omentum requires that the oscillator occupies a large set of adjacent =attice 
locations. SmoothLife is a variant of Game of Life that uses =ery large neighborhoods and indeed delivers stable 
oscillators that can =ravel in arbitrary directions. 
> I think I have some idea how to extend this toy model towards =scillators with variable speed and more than two 
dimensions. It may =lso possible to show that there are reasons why stable traveling =scillators can exist in id, 2d and 3d 
but not in 4d, for similar =easons why stable planetary orbits only work in 3d. 
> To give a brief intution about a traveling oscillator as a wavelet: =hink of a wavelet as two concentric circles, one 
representing the =eviation above zero, the other one the deviation below zero. They try =0 equalize, but because the 
catch up is not immediately, they just =witch their value instead. (This is the discretized simplification.) =ow displace the 
inner circle with respect to the outer one: the =rrangement starts to travel. Making the pattern stable requires =istorting 
the circles, and probably relaxing the discretization by =ncreasing the resolution. The frequency of the wavelet 
oscillation is =nversely related to how fast it can travel.

> Also, =he faster the vortex moves sideways, the slower it must
