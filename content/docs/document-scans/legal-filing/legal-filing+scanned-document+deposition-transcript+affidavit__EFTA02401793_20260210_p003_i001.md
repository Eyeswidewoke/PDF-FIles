Two years, two stor=es 
When Egyptians of a=l classes and persuasions united against their dictator of three decades i= 2011, the call was for 
bread, freedom and dignity. The results under all =hree headings have been mixed and each gain has come at a price. 
The brief unity is long since gone; accounts of =hat happened to it, and to the country, depend strongly on who is telling 
=hem. 
The version favoure= by Islamists is a saga of success. Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim B=otherhood endured 
decades of suppression. Drawing inspiration from a wide =ange of hierarchical institutions, from the Boy Scouts to the 
Communist Party, the Brothers worked assiduousl= to spread a culture of resistance to Western influence. 
Their message, expo=nded by a disciplined network, resonated more and more under Mr Mubarak. F=ith provided 
solace and strength in the face of poverty and political repr=ssion. And Mr Mubarak allowed the Brotherhood just scope 
enough to spook Western powers, who could reliably be worried b= Islamist bogeymen. This cynical ploy gave the 
Brotherhood a level of poli=ical experience no other opposition to Mr Mubarak could match. 
The temporary milit=ry rulers who followed Mr Mubarak saw the Brotherhood as a partner capable=of harnessing the 
Egyptian "street" while subject to the sort of disci=line with which military men feel comfortable. They took its advice 
when crafting their transition plan—which, promoted=by Islamists as a vote for the faith, was passed with a thumping 
77% major=ty in March 2011. This plan deferred the drafting of a constitution, calli=g first for parliamentary elections: 
parliament would then select a constituent assembly to write a constitutio=. Once that had been written, Egypt could 
hold a presidential election. 
Aware of its electo=al advantage, the Brotherhood initially promised to run for only a third o= parliamentary seats. But it 
changed its mind, and the elections of Decemb=r 2011 to January 2012 gave the Brothers 47% of seats. To widespread 
surprise Salafist parties, representing an eve= more conservative Islamist tendency, claimed nearly a quarter of the 
vote=. "We have tried socialism and capitalism," was the simple refrain voi=ed widely in Egypt's sprawling slums and 
villages, "so why not try Islam?" In many constituencies voters ha= no other choice. Secular parties had little reach 
outside cities, and cou=d certainly not match the Islamists' provision of charity, cheap goods a=d useful services. They 
scarcely bothered to compete for seats in the Shura Council, the weak upper parliamentary ho=se, which was elected on 
a tiny turnout in February 2012. 
Understandably, the=lslamists saw parliamentary elections as a vindication of their claim to r=present Egypt's silent 
majority. But as the new parliament, well stocked=with what many educated Egyptians regarded as bearded yokels, fell 
into bickering and grandstanding, a backlash began=to build. The generals, still in power until the June 2012 election of a 
n=w president, began to share fears, felt deeply by Egypt's Christian mino=ity and also by the country's entrenched 
establishment, that the Islamists' agenda could prove dangerously divisi=e. Courts dismissed the parliament's first 
choice of a 100-person consti=uent assembly, ostensibly on technical grounds but really, it appears, bec=use it was seen 
as insufficiently representative of non-Islamists. Though the constitution was delayed, the army decided pr=sidential 
elections should go ahead regardless. 
When the Brotherhoo= broke an earlier promise not to run a presidential candidate, the army-ap=ointed elections board 
disqualified its first choice, Khairat al-Shater, a=businessman seen as the group's intellectual strongman. Mr Morsi, its 
reserve candidate, was a professor of engineering=known for unquestioning loyalty to the Brotherhood's "guidance 
bureau=94. 
Despite the Brother=ood's powerful and well financed machine, Mr Morsi garnered just 25% of =he vote; more than any 
other candidate, but a lot less than expected. Over=ll, non-Islamist candidates captured a slim majority. But the one 
among them with the most votes, and thus Mr M=rsi's second-round opponent, was Ahmed Shafiq, a suave air-force 
officer=and a minister under Mr Mubarak—a past that many non-Islamists could not=stomach. Their votes were crucial 
in giving Mr Morsi his eventual narrow win. To soothe their fears, Mr Morsi r=signed from the Freedom and Justice
