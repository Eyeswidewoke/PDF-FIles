So long as the depositary for a global preferred security, or its nominee, is the registered owner of such 
global preferred security, such depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner 
or holder of the preferred securities represented by such global preferred security for all purposes under the 
restated trust agreement governing such preferred securities. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial 
interests in a global preferred security will not be entitled to have any of the individual preferred securities 
represented by such global preferred security registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive 
physical delivery of any such preferred securities in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or 
holders thereof under the restated trust agreement. 
Payments of any liquidation amount, premium or distributions in respect of individual preferred securities 
registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee will be made to the depositary or its nominee, as the case 
may be. as the registered owner of the global preferred security representing such preferred securities. None of 
W. R. Berkley, the property trustee, any paying agent, or the securities registrar for such preferred securities will 
have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of 
beneficial ownership interests of the global preferred security representing such preferred securities or for 
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. 
We expect that the depositary or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment in respect of a global preferred security 
representing the trust's preferred securities, will credit immediately participants' accounts with payments in amounts 
proportionate to their respective beneficial interest in the aggregate liquidation amount of such global preferred security 
for such preferred securities as shown on the records of such depositary or its nominee. We also expect that payments 
by participants to owners of beneficial interests in such global preferred security held through such participants will be 
governed by standing instructions and customary practices. as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of 
customers in bearer form or registered in "street name" and will be the responsibility of such participants. 
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. the restated trust agreement will 
provide that: 
if we advise the trustees in writing that the depositary is no longer willing or able to act as depositary 
and we fail to appoint a qualified successor within 90 days; 
• 
we at our option advise the trustees in writing that we elect to terminate the book-entry system through 
the depositary: or 
after the occurrence of an event of default under the corresponding subordinated debt securities, owners 
of preferred securities representing at least a majority of liquidation amount of such preferred securities 
advise the property trustee in writing that the continuation of a book•entry system through the 
depositary is no longer in their best interests; 
then the global preferred securities will be exchanged for preferred securities in definitive form in accordance 
with the instructions of the depositary. It is expected that such instructions may be based upon directions received 
by the depositary from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in global preferred securities. 
Individual preferred securities so issued will be issued in authorized denominations. 
Payment and Paying Agency 
Payments in respect of the preferred securities shall be made to the depositary, which shall credit the 
relevant accounts at the depositary on the applicable distribution dates or. if the trust's preferred securities are not 
held by the depositary, such payments shall be made by check mailed to the address of the holder entitled thereto 
as such address shall appear on the register of the trust. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus 
supplement, the paying agent shall initially be the property trustee and any copaying agent chosen by the 
property trustee and acceptable to us and the administrative trustees. The paying agent shall be permitted to 
resign as paying agent upon 30 days' written notice to us and the property trustee. In the event the property 
trustee shall no longer be the paying agent, the administrative trustees shall appoint a successor, which shall be a 
bank or trust company acceptable to the administrative trustees and us. to act as paying agent. (Section 5.9)
