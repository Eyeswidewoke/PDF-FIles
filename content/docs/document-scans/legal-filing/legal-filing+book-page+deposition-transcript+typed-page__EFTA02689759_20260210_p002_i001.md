History of Academic Medicine 
about 6,000 of the 9,000 doctors 
graduating from medical school each year 
to be drafted by the Department of 
Defense." 
Selective Service director Lewis Hershey 
used the conscription policies to create a 
comprehensive workforce policy he 
called "channeling," where men were 
directed through "pressurized guidance" 
into desirable civilian and military 
pursuits considered to be in the national 
interest' "From the individual's 
viewpoint," commented Hershey. "he is 
standing in a room which has been made 
uncomfortably warm. Several doors are 
open, but they all lead to various forms of 
recognized, patriotic service to the 
nation." 
More than 700 doctors, dentists, and 
other health care professionals could 
satisfy their military obligation each year 
through service in the PHS 
Commissioned Corps.° The NIH used the 
channeling policy to recruit highly 
sought-after medial school graduates 
eager to pursue careers in academic 
medicine. As U.S. involvement in the war 
escalated, more physicians sought to 
fulfill their military obligations through 
work at the NIH, and the number of 
applicants and the size of the ATP grew.' 
In 1965, the year that the first U.S. 
ground troops landed in Saigon, 153 
physicians reported to the ATP to fulfill 
their military obligation. The following 
year, the number of new associates 
jumped to 178, and by 1970, it increased 
to 206. In 1973, the year a peace 
settlement in Paris led to a ceasefire in 
Vietnam. the number of new associates 
peaked at 229 (Figure 1).' 
The "Yellow Berets" 
The term "Yellow Berets" was used in a 
derogatory manner during the Vietnam 
War to contrast draft dodgers with the 
elite Green Berets—the U.S. Army 
Special Forces—in a period beset by 
ongoing strife and civilian antiwar 
protests. Its origin is not clear, but it was 
used in a 1966 Bob Seger song, "Ballad of 
the Yellow Baer": 
Fearless cowards of the USA 
Bravely here at home they stay 
They watch their friends get shipped away 
The draft dodgers of the Yellow Beret. 
"To our amusement we PHS officers 
were called 'Yellow Berets' by the officers 
from the naval hospital across Rockville

Pike." recalled William Eaton, who was 
an NII I investigator in 1968.9 Although 
the associates did not use the term 
themselves during the war, when many 
adopted it years later, it took on an ironic 
connotation. Bernard M. Babior, a 
research scientist who trained at the NIH, 
used the term wryly in a poem he wrote 
to the NIH scientist Earl Stadtman in 
1990': 
Whereas my draft board said to me, "IA: 
I from ascetic Boston made my way 
Bethesdawards, to Stadtman's realm secure 
To soldier for a while in the Yellow Beret. 
Examining the influence of the "Yellow 
Berets" 
After completing their military 
obligations in the ATP, many NIH 
associates returned to U.S. medical 
schools and helped form academic 
faculties that developed clinical 
research training programs. "All of the 
professors wanted to have their best 
students come here," recalled Joseph E. 
Rath'o who was director of intramural 
research at an NIH institute during the 
Doctor Draft, "because they knew that 
they would be here for two or three 
years and then probably come back to 
their university." 
The former NIH associates, the "Yellow 
Berets," arc said to have had a defining 
influence on academic medicine in the 
years following their NW training. A 
previous survey found that, in 1998, 
23.6% of the professors of medicine at 
Harvard Medical School and 21% at 
Johns Hopkins University School of 
Medicine were former NIH associates.' 
Our goal %r this study is to demonstrate, 
using both qualitative (archival research 
and oral history) and quantitative (data 
matching) methods, that a substantial 
portion of the young physicians who 
fulfilled their military obligations 
through service in the NW ATP during 
the Doctor Draft went on to assume 
leadership roles within U.S. academic 
medicine as a result of the high-level 
training and networking opportunities 
available to them at the NIH. The ATP 
during this period, we will demonstrate, 
was the most important source of 
physician—scientists for a generation. 
Method 
Qualitative analysis 
As part of a John 1. Pisano Travel Grant 
awarded by the Office of NIH History in 
2001, one of the authors (SS.) 
interviewed selected associates who 
entered the ATP during the period of the 
Doctor Draft (1950-1973) about their 
experiences and the training they
