Fixed-income market perspectives 
The China syndrome 
China and commodities continue to unsettle the markets. The 
PBoC started to devalue its currency in mid-August. While the 
adjustment so far may not look that significant, it constitutes 
both a monetary-policy regime shift and an implicit admission of 
slower Chinese economic growth. 
To better assess the importance of the move it is helpful to 
contrast the physical and economic size of China with its 
relatively low GDP per capita (one seventh that of the U.S., in 
U.S. dollar terms). This catch-up potential is important for global 
growth and, in particular, commodities. Externally, to underpin 
its global position, China also wants to establish the yuan as a 
key trading currency, with the aim of reducing the emerging 
markets' dependence on the U.S. dollar. It is therefore trying 
to get the yuan included in the basket of currencies which 
constitutes the IMF's Special Drawing Bights. Until recently, 
China had long seen yuan stability as a way of gaining the 
necessary credibility and this might explain its attempts to 
defend the value of the currency versus the U.S. dollar in recent 
years. However, the resulting real appreciation of the yuan hurt 
both exports and growth. In addition. defending the yuan led to a 
significant decrease in China's U.S. dollar reserves in both 2014 
and 2015 (see chart). 
China's new currency regime kills three birds with one stone. 
First, it is a move towards a more market-oriented exchange-rate 
system, as desired by the IMF. Second, currency depreciation 
helps export sectors, providing one way to reinvigorate growth. 
In this respect, it is not the relatively small adjustment in the 
currency so far but the potential further adjustment that matters. 
Finally, it has helped shifted attention away from China's equity-
market interventions. 
The new regime has led to "risk off" sentiment in the fixed-
income markets and significant moves in Asian currencies 
versus the U.S dollar. We believe that China might devalue 
further and other Asian central banks (e.g. Taiwan, South Korea, 
Japan) could respond with monetary easing and currency 
depreciation to maintain competitiveness The resulting 
resurrection of deflation fears could continue to weigh on rates 
over the next few weeks, longer term the currency-induced 
growth effects should kick in. We remain long-term constructive 
on emerging markets and high-yield, but would currently only 
add selectively, for example in euro high-yield 
Quarterly change in China's foreign-exchange reserve" 
Defending the yuan against a strong U.S. dollar in the old 
currency-peg system led to a fall in reserves in 2014 and 
2015 ...although total reserves remain substantial.
