the postulate that physical interactions are local. Might it be possible that the concept of locality is 
weakened or altered in a way that incorporates the observer dependence of worldline coincidence, 
but in a way that still restricts physical interactions in a way that is consistent with observations? 
To investigate this we have to formulate exactly what is the concept of locality that is allowed 
by the structure of physics in n-Minkoski spacetime. In this regard, I propose for consideration 
the following notion of locality, which i will call n-locality. I define it as follows. N ≥ 3 events 
E7, I = 1, 2, 3... each on the worldline of a particle, 4(r) are n-local if there is a passive Lorentz 
transformation to the description seen by another observer, which maps the these events to a 
single event, p°. (4(r) = (t, 4(r)). Since each event is on a different worldline the Lorentz 
transformation leads them to intersect at a common point. Thus we say that the worldlines which 
do not intersect, but which can be mapped to intersecting worldlines by an energy and momentum 
dependent Lorentz transformation are n-intersecting. 
We then make a postulate which is a consequence of observer independence: Suppose that there 
are N ≥ 3 events, on N worldlines, which are kappa-local. Then an interaction will take place with the 
same probability as it is seen to take place in the frame of the observer who sees the three events mapped 
to a single event, which is a coincidence of all three worldlittes. 
We can call this the hypothesis of 
tc-locality of physics. This can be easily generalized to more than three events. Note that, for the 
interaction probability to be non-zero, in addition to the worldlines coinciding the onservation of 
energy and momentum must be satisfied. So the condition of the worldlines being n-intersecting 
is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an interaction to take place. 
We next ask whether the hypothesis of n-locality could be consistent with observation. There 
will certainly be an inconsistency with observation if n-locality is generic. By this I mean the 
following. Consider an arbitrarily chosen N-tuplet of world-lines of particles in spacetime. Each 
is a solution of the equations of motion and so is specified by a point in the phase space of a free 
relativistic particle. Generically they do not intersect, (we assume for the moment that space has 
d = 3 dimensions, below we consider the special case of d = 1.) Now we say that n-locality is 
generic if for every such triple of particle worldlines there is an inertial observer who sees them to 
intersect at a point. That is, there are N ≥ 3 events on the N worldlines that are taken to a single 
event under some momentum dependent Lorentz transformation. 
If n-locality is generic in this sense then the postulate of ti-locality of physics still does not 
imply that any N ≥ 3 particles interact just as if they had an intersection. The conservation laws 
still have to be satisfied. But physics would still look very non-local because an interaction would 
be no more or less likely to happen then for the case of particles whose worldlines intersect at an 
event. 
But suppose instead that n-locality was a property of measure zero among triples of worldlines 
of particles. Then the situation is very different. In this case, we cannot use the fact that physical 
interactions have so far been found to be local to rule out the hypothesis that physics is instead 
n-local. This is because to see that physics is n-local rather than local we would have to very 
carefully prepare triples of particles on worldlines that have the property that a n-local set can be 
made by selecting one event on each worldline. Since such experiments have never been made we 
cannot rule out the hypothesis that physics is n—local. Indeed, it might be of interest to investigate 
how such experiments might be done. 
Below i study separately the cases of d = 1 and d = 3 dimensions and show that in both cases 
n-locality is a property of measure zero among triples or higher multiplets of worldlines. Hence I 
conclude that at least in n-Minkowski spacetime the argument for a bound from observation fails.
