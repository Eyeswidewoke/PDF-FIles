"Twenty year= ago, we had no idea that Christians came this far south and east in the Ar=bian Gulf," Dr Joseph Elders, 
the project's archaeological director, who be=an excavating the site nearly two decades ago, said yesterday as he led 
rep=rters on a tour of the site. 
"This shows that Christianity had penetrated far fur=her than we thought before ... We don't have many monasteries 
from this per=od." 
T=e monastery complex, a multi-building compound located on the eastern side o= the 87-square-kilometre island, is 
the only pre-Islamic Christian site kno=n in the UAE. Discovered in 1992 during an archaeological survey, the monas=ery 
is believed to have been an important destination for pilgrims travelli=g along a trade route to India. 
"We think quite a lot of visitors came to the mon=stery," said Dr Elders. "These people wanted to be visited." 
A separate room for v=sitors was built within the monastery complex itself, where pilgrims could p=ay or leave gifts. Dr 
Elders, who is also the chief archaeologist for the C=urch of England, said the archaeological team believes the visitors 
might h=ve been attracted to the site because it was founded by a saint, or holy ma=. 
The=archaeological team has unearthed only one body at the monastery site, but t=e discovery was a significant one. 
The church was built around the grave, w=ich might have belonged to the settlement's founder, the same local saint 
w=ose presence brought travellers to the island. 
"Academically, it's fascinating andrreally important," said Peter Hellyer, the excavation's project manager and=a 
columnist for The National. "It explains a lot more about the heritage of=this country. Most people wouldn't know that 
history, that there was Christ=anity here before Islam." 
Christianity spread throughout the Gulf between the yea=s 50 and 350, following the trade routes. The inhabitants of 
the 7th-centur= settlement probably belonged to the Nestorian Church, or Church of the Eas=. Researchers believe the 
wealthy community was made up of a mixture of peo=le from along the Gulf, and local residents who spoke Syriac and 
Arabic. 
The comm=nity probably chose the site based on its location at the head of a natural=sheltered harbour.

15 types of pottery at the comp=ex. The complex itself comprises monks' cells, kitchens and animal pens sur=ounding a 
courtyard with a church dominating the centre. The artefacts, inc=uding bowls, jars, glass vessels and ceremonial vases, 
reveal that the monk= had ties to modern-day Iraq, India and maybe Bahrain.

"We are delighted to be opening this ancient site to=the public, which gives visitors an insight into the rich history of Sir 
Ba=i Yas Island and the UAE," said Sheikh Sultan bin Tahnoun Al Nahyan, the ch=irman of the Tourism Development and 
Investment Company (TDIC). "We are pro=d of our heritage and are therefore focused on creating a multi-experience 
t=urism destination where guests are able to enjoy a variety of activities, w=ile protecting and preserving the history and 
culture of our country, as we=l as the natural environment of the island." 
The 65-square-metre archeological si=e, which is enclosed within a protective fence and covered as part of conse=vation 
and preservation efforts, is part of an effort to highlight the hist=ry and heritage of the island. Envisioned as part of the 
Desert Islands tourism experience, a visit to the monastery could eventually be part of a heri=age trail that would 
include other significant archaeological sites on the i=land.
