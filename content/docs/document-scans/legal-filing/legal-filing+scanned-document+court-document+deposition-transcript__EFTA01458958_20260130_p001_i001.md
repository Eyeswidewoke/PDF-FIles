World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
US' Dollar drag 
On the back of weak manufacturing and international trade data, second-
half 2015 real GDP growth is poised to rise by less than 2% as current-
quarter output is projected to increase just 1.5%. This would result in 2015 
growth of 2.0% (O4/O4), slightly below the 2.2% average annualized gain 
in economic output since the economy exited recession more than six 
years ago. More importantly, we expect 2016 real GDP growth to come in 
at only 2.2% (O4/O4), down 50 basis points from our previous estimate. 
This is due to a reassessment of the negative effects of the rising dollar 
and the possibility of further appreciation yet to come. 
• 
Nevertheless, with real potential GDP growth only around 1% due to 
slowing productivity growth, even a trend-like 2% GDP growth rate would 
likely be enough to put further downward pressure on the unemployment 
rate. Consequently, this should keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates, 
albeit at a very modest pace, as policymakers gain confidence that a 
tightening labor market will engender faster wage gains and a cyclical 
firming of inflation toward their 2% long-term goal. 
• 
The US factory sector is bearing the brunt of depressed global demand. 
The manufacturing ISM survey is in contraction territory, and the industrial 
production index is down from its cyclical peak in December 2014. Given 
that changes in the trade-weighted dollar tend to affect net exports with a 
substantial lag, the economy has yet to experience the full impact of the 
appreciating dollar. If the trade-weighted dollar remains at its current level 
or appreciates further, net exports could pose a more significant drag on 
US economic activity. 
• 
Based on the appreciation to date, we estimate the rise in the dollar is 
worth roughly 60 basis points of monetary tightening. The fact that the 
currency is doing some of the Fed's work for it is one reason why we 
expect the trajectory of interest rates to be mildly shallower than that 
implied by the FOMC's central-tendency forecasts. The strong dollar will 
also weigh on import prices, and hence consumer goods inflation. To be 
sure, there is a risk that the US dollar will rise substantially further because 
the Fed is the only major central bank that is beginning to remove 
monetary accommodation. Other central banks, notably the ECB, are 
further easing monetary policy. Furthermore, the US factory sector is being 
hamstrung by a mini-inventory cycle that is also depressing output. This 
destocking will likely end next quarter. In the interim, the consumer looks 
set to continue to do the heavy lifting with respect to growth, but we 
expect spending to modestly slow over the course of next year because of 
the waning impact of the energy tax cut, a substantial portion of which 
appears to have been saved. 
• 
Additionally, we see only modest scope for non-residential investment to 
fill the void, as the uncertainty around global growth prospects and the 
outcome of the US Presidential Election may keep companies in a wait-
and-see mode with respect to capital spending plans. While the drag from 
energy-related capital spending should dissipate in the coming quarters, it 
is not likely that we will see a meaningful boost to output growth from 
non-residential investment over the next several quarters.
