* 
This is not to say that value is not usefu=. We do believe that value combined with a positive fundamental 
change pro=ides a good reason to overweight a region or sector. And this is why we in=tead overweight Europe in our 
regional portfolio. 
* 
Japanese equities have stopped outperfo=ming. We reduced our overweigh= in Japanese vs. EM equities 
in our model portfolio in this week's GMOS. There is currently no policy impetus and the positive economic=news is 
largely priced in. In addition, CFTC spec positions on Nikkei are =rifting lower, suggesting that overseas investors have 
started taking prof=t on the Japanese equity trade. 
Credit<=span> 
* 
US Financials have outperformed Non=F inancials recently and are now only 1 lbp wider in spread, close to 
the 8b= multi-year tight reached in May. We expect continued Financials outperfor=ance due to stronger fundamentals, 
the recovery in Europe, and the deterioration of some non-Fi=ancial sectors driven by commodity trends, competitive 
environment and sha=eholder friendly activity (CMOS, Eric Beinstein et al., Aug 9). We =re OW both US and European 
financials in our GMOS portfolio.

In Europe, the improved economic ou=look and continued strong demand for quality spread product are 
strong pos=tives. At this point, we see more upside on our European growth forecasts =han in the US. In addition, as we 
argued in last week's Flows & Liquidity, Who is driv=ng the great rotation?, Aug 2, US investors are moving from fixed 
inco=e into equities but we are not seeing this rotation in Europe, giving supp=rt for euro spread product relative to the 
US market. Euro spreads used to trade well below US spreads before the=great recession (see chart on the right) and 
with some form of normality r=turning to the Euro area, we think there is reason to believe that euro sp=eads will again 
trade well below US spreads.

With US 10-yr yields side-winding around 2=6% for almost two months and FX volumes down to their 
typical August lows,=the dollar index is freefalling. The trade-weighted currency (JPMQUSD) has=declined for four of the 
past five weeks, and while moves have been inconsistent across pairs, =ome of this year's biggest losers (JPY, GBP, NZD, 
NOK, ZAR) have becom= this month's biggest gainers. When the dollar was rallying in late spri=g it seemed 
unreasonable to expect the move to be so broad and persistent throughout 2013, since that view assume= that only the 
US economy would perk up in Q2/Q3. Instead, selective USD s=rength has been our message for months. Now that the 
dollar is collapsing =n a number of crosses, it also seems hasty to extrapolate. The baseline view this fall for a higher US= 
vs Asia and some commodity currencies (AUD, ZAR) is unchanged, even w=th better Chinese data. If China only manages 
to stabilize but US rates he=d higher this fall, commodity FX like AUD will probably decline. 
* 
The euro and sterling have bounced 3% over=the past month, moves which are middle-of-the-pack 
globally but nonetheles= surprising given the forward guidance the ECB and BoE premiered or previe=ed on July 4. Since 
these banks were unveiling guidance in the context of economies exiting recessio= (Euro area) or sub-trend growth (UK), 
and since US rates seemed headed hi=her, our view then was that rate guidance would weaken EUR and GBP within 
=heir ranges but strengthen some Central European currencies like PLN. What explains EUR and GBP's rise= Growth 
surprises, mainly. More Euro area and UK releases than US ones h=ve been beating expectations since May, despite a 
few high-profile beats i= the US like Q2 GDP and PMIs/ISMs. And since bond markets tend to move as much on data 
momentum as they do on cen=ral bank policy, forward guidance may only be relevant once the consensus =evelops a 
more realistic view on European/UK growth, or until US data exhi=it more consistency. Unless we have seriously 
misjudged the likelihood of a US acceleration this fall as =iscal drag fades, or unless we have underestimated the ability 
of Europe t= deliver above-trend growth for a few quarters, EUR/USD and GBP/USD should=revert lower by a few cents 
but remain within this year's range.
