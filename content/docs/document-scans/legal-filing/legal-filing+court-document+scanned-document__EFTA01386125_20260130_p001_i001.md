Prime Brokers 
On page 27 of the Memorandum, under the section headed "Brokerage and Custody", the 
following sub-sections shall be inserted after the first paragraph: 
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC 
Credit Suisse acts as a prime broker and custodian to the Master Fund pursuant to the terms and 
conditions of a Customer Agreement (together with the Annexes thereto) dated January 12, 2012 
(the "Credit Suisse Prime Brokerage Agreement"). Credit Suisse is a part of the Credit Suisse 
Group and is based in New York, with offices worldwide. Credit Suisse provides prime brokerage 
and custody services to the Master Fund under normal commercial terms pursuant to the Credit 
Suisse Prime Brokerage Agreement. 
In accordance with applicable US law, including but not limited to, the rules and regulations of the 
US Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), all of the assets of the Master Fund are 
held in the name of the Master Fund and beneficial ownership thereof is recorded on the books of 
Credit Suisse as belonging to the Master Fund. The rules of the SEC require that Credit Suisse 
holds all fully-paid and excess margin customer securities either physically or in a control 
location. To the extent of applicable US law, such securities and cash will generally not be 
available to the creditors of Credit Suisse. 
Credit Suisse and its affiliates have a security interest in all securities and other property of the 
Master Fund that are delivered to, in the possession of or held in an account at Credit Suisse or 
its affiliates. All of the Master Fund's securities, commodities or other property may from time to 
time (without notice to the Master Fund) be pledged, repledged, hypothecated, rehypothecated, 
sold or otherwise transferred or used, in which event the Master Fund will only have a right to the 
return of equivalent assets. 
However, any such pledging, re-pledging, hypothecation, re-hypothecation, selling, transfer or 
use by Credit Suisse or its affiliates is subject to the applicable rules of the SEC (including, 
without limitation, Rule 15c3-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) which 
limits the amount Credit Suisse can pledge, repledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell or 
otherwise transfer or use to an amount up to but not exceeding 140% of the Master Fund's 
margin debit balance. 
Credit Suisse or its affiliates may execute any of their duties and exercise its rights by or through 
agents. In selecting and appointing such agents, Credit Suisse or its affiliates shall use 
commercially reasonable care to ensure that they appoint only persons or entities they 
reasonably believe to be competent and will periodically make what they reasonably consider to
