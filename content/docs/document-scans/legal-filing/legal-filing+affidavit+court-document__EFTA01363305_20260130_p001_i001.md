748 F.2d 602, *; 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 15990, **; 
1984-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P66,311; 40 Fed. R. Serv. 2d (Callaghan) 954 
legal counsel. Southwest Express Co., Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 670 F.2d 
53, 55 (5th Cir.1982); K.M.A., Inc. v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, 652 F.2d 
398, 399 (5th Cir.1981). 
This rule ensures that a licensed attorney, an officer of the court, is responsible for 
conducting the corporation's litigation. It protects the court and the public from 
unscrupulous and irresponsible behavior. In this case, for example, Patterson continually 
made unwarranted personal attacks on the court and opposing counsel, repeatedly misled 
the court as to the state of the record, and raised frivolous motions and objections. An 
attorney would have been deterred from engaging in such behavior because of his 
obligations to the court and his fear of the sanctions [**22] that might otherwise be 
imposed by the court and the bar. 
Patterson sought to circumvent the rule which prevents a nonlawyer from representing a 
corporation by dissolving SAFFCO. To this end, Patterson dissolved SAFFCO in 
accordance with Georgia law and moved to substitute himself, doing ['610] business as 
Screen Advertising Film Fund Company, as party plaintiff. As a sole proprietor, he could 
proceed pro se under section 1654. 
The trial court denied Patterson's motion. In its dispositive order, the court observed that 
this o a complicated antitrust case: that the appropriate handling of this case demands skilled attorneys. who are 
officers of this Court; that attempts by Mr. Patterson to act pro se have been and will be disruptive of the orderly 
processing of this litigation (observe the ad hominem approach adopted in the motion to substitute order and the 
motion for sanctions). 
In a courtroom setting should Mr. Patterson be on the witness stand and at the same time attempting to act as his own 
attorney. the task of the trial judge in preventing the trial from degenerating would be a difficult one. 
Patterson takes issue with the court's r231 ruling. 
[HN9I Georgia law provides that a cause of action on behalf of a corporation, which is the 
subject of litigation pending on the date of dissolution, may continue to be prosecuted by 
the corporation in its corporate name. Ga.Code Ann. 14-2-293 (1982). A dissolved 
corporation may maintain a federal suit when it has been given that power by state law. 
Bauer v. Uniroyal Tire Co., 630 F.2d 1287, 1290 n. 2 (8th Cir.1980); Froning's, Inc. v. 
Johnston Feed Service, Inc., 568 F.2d 108, 110 (8th Cir.1978). When Patterson moved to 
substitute himself for his dissolved corporation, the question became whether the court 
could insist that SAFFCO continue to prosecute the case. 
Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(c) speaks to this question; it governs the substitution of parties during 
pending litigation due to a transfer of interest through corporate dissolution. Froning's, Inc. 
v. Johnston Feed Service, Inc., 568 F.2d at 110; Panther Pumps & Equipment Co. v. 
Hydrocraft, Inc., 566 F.2d 8, 23 (7th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1013, 98 S. Ct. 1887, 
56 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1978). ("241 The rule states, in pertinent part, 
IHN10) (c) Transfer of Interest. In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the 
original party. unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in 
the action or joined with the original party.
