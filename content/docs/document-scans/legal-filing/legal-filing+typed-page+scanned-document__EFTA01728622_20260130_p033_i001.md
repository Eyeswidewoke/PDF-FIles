As previously stated this new typology is a continuum. A preferential sex 
offender can have some of the motives and behavior patterns of a situational sex 
offender and vice versa. It is a matter of degree. For example in one case an 
offender who was a schoolteacher had a child-pornography videotape mailed to 
him at the school where he worked. The "smart" thing to do would have been 
to take it home and view it in privacy; however, the teacher took it to a 
videocassette recorder (VCR) at the school for immediate viewing. This was a 
fantasy-driven, "needy" mistake typical of preferential sex offenders. To make it 
worse he forgot to move a switch, and the tape was shown on numerous moni-
ton around the school leading to his identification. This was a "sloppy" mistake. 
Although this typology continuum will be applied here primarily to child 
molesters, it can be applied to any sex offender. Nuisance sex offenders (e.g., 
window peepers, fetish burglars, obscene telephone callers, flashers) are the sex 
offenders most likely to exhibit predominately preferential motives and patterns. 
Child molesters are more evenly distributed between offenders exhibiting pre-
dominately preferential and situational motives and patterns. Offenders who rape 
adults are the sex offenders most likely to exhibit predominately situational 
motives and patterns. In my opinion this is why one hears it said so often that 
rape is not about sex and is not really a sex crime. In spite of this common and 
"politically correct" view, some rapists are preferential-type sex offenders and for 
them rape is primarily about sex. One rarely hears it said, however, that child 
molesting is not about sex or not a sex crime. This is most likely due to the fact 
that more child molesters exhibit preferential patterns of sexual behavior and do 
not use physical force or violence to control their victims. 
Situational-Type Child Molesters 
The situational-type child molester does not usually have compulsive-paraphilic 
sexual preferences including a preference for children. He may, however, engage 
in sex with children for varied and sometimes complex reasons. For such a child 
molester, sex with children may range from a "once-in-a-lifetime" act to along-
term pattern of behavior. The more long-term the pattern, the further down the 
continuum he may move. He will exhibit more and more of the behavior pat-
terns of the preferential-type offender. The situational-type molester usually has 
fewer child victims. Other vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly, sick, or 
disabled, may also be at a risk of sexual victimization by him. For example the 
situational-type child molester who sexually abuses children in a daycare center 
might leave that job and begin to sexually abuse elderly people in a nursing home. 
Situational offenders are not "better" than nor as "bad" as preferential offenders; 
they are just' ifferent. Within this category at least three major patterns of behav-
ior emerge. These regressed, morally indiscriminate, and inadequate patterns are 
described below. 
Regressed Such an offender usually has low self-esteem and poor coping skills; 
he turns to children as a sexual substitute for the preferred-peer sex partner. Pre-
cipitating stress may play a bigger role in his molesting behavior. His main victim 
criterion seems to be availability, which is why many of these offenders molest 
their own children. His principal method of operation is to coerce the child into 
having sex. This type of situational child molester may or may not collect child or 
adult pornography. If he does have child pornography it will usually be the "best
