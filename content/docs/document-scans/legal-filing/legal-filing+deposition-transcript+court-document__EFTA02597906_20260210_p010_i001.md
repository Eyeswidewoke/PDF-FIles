this proposal, Mr. =exner and the Trust would permit the Company to use the restricted cash to repurchase Shares at a 
premium to their market price and would agree not to participate in such repurchase. Consequently, the Company, Mr. 
Wexner and t=e Trust would agree 
3 
to rescind the Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement. The terms of the Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement are 
summarized in the Company's 1=99 Proxy Statement and a copy of the Agreement has been filed with the Commiss=on 
as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 1996 =iscal year, and may be obtained in the manner 
described in Section 10. 
On various occasions, the Board and the Finance Committee of the Board have considered aspects of the Contingent 
Stock Redemption Agreement. With the advice of Lazard Freres & Co.lic, the Company's financial advisor =ith respect to 
this matter, and Davis Polk & Wardwell, its legal advisor, t=e Board concluded that, although the Company's rights under 
the Contingen= Stock Redemption Agreement (which are not exercisable until July 31, 2006) were potentially of future 
benefit to the Company's stockholders other than =r. Wexner, the opportunity for the Company to use the 
approximately $352 milli=n in restricted cash to repurchase Shares at a premium represented a greater immediate, 
tangible benefit to the Company's public stockholders, and w=s therefore in their best overall interests. In addition, the 
Board recognize= that certain other corporate objectives would be facilitated by rescinding =he Contingent Stock 
Redemption Agreement. As such, on April 30, 1999, the Boar= voted to rescind the Contingent Stock Redemption 
Agreement, provided that (=) the approximately $352 million in restricted cash would be made available t= be used for 
the purposes of this Offer, (2) Mr. Wexner, affiliated entities and members of Mr. Wexner's immediate family would 
agree not to tender =ny Shares in the Offer and (3) certain other conditions were satisfied. On May=3, 1999, a special 
committee of the Board approved the terms of an agreement (=he "Rescission Agreement") implementing the foregoing 
matters and th= Rescission Agreement was entered into. 
Purpose of the Offer 
The Offer is an integral part of the Company's ongoing strategy of allo=ing the Company to focus on its key businesses 
and maximizing stockholder value= The purpose of the Offer is to allow those stockholders desiring to receive cash for a 
portion of their Shares an opportunity to do so at a premium ove= the recent trading prices for the Shares. While the 
Board continues to beli=ve that the Shares represent an attractive investment for its continuing stockholders, the Offer 
presents stockholders who may wish to receive an immediate cash premium for their Shares with an opportunity to 
realize such premium by tendering Shares in the Offer.
