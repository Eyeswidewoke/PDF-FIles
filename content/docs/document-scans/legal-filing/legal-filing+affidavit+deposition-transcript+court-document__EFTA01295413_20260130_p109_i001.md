2004 Ohio 6250, *; 2004 Ohio App. LEXIS 5682, ** 
Jeepers sought judgment relating to Note 1, claiming that the agreement discharged 
Jeepers of this debt. Hanlin-Rainaldi opposed Jeepers' motion for summary judgment. 
r P14] On April 1, 2003, the trial court rendered a decision, wherein it granted in part and 
denied in part Hanlin-Rainaldi's motion for summary judgment and granted Jeepers' 
motion for summary judgment; however, this decision was later vacated. Pursuant to 
Civ.R. 53 and local rule, the trial court r 7] later referred the matter to a magistrate for a 
mediation conference. After reaching an impasse, the matter was referred for further 
motion practice and trial preparation. 
r P151 On July 24, 2003, the trial court rendered judgment wherein it granted in part and 
denied in part both Hanlin-Rainaldi's and Jeepers' motions for summary judgment. In its 
judgment, the trial court found in favor of Hanlin-Rainaldi concerning its claims that 
Jeepers breached the August 2001 agreement and was liable to Hanlin-Rainaldi under 
Notes 2 and 3. However, the trial court found in favor of Jeepers as to Hanlin-Rainaldi's 
claims that Jeepers failed to satisfy its obligation under Note 1 and Jeepers was unjustly 
enriched. From this judgment, Hanlin-Rainaldi appeals and asserts a single assignment of 
error: 
The trial court erred as a matter of law in applying the parol evidence rule to bar evidence of Appellee's subsequent 
conduct 
r P16] In its reply brief, Hanlin-Rainaldi alternatively asserts: 
The trial court erred as a matter of law by failing to consider evidence of Appellee's subsequent payments on the note 
to show intent and meaning, including whether such conduct constituted rit] a modification or waiver of the terms of 
the release language in the settlement agreement. 
r P17] We will first address which substantive law and procedural law apply to this cause. 
r P113] [HN1] The Supreme Court of Ohio has held: 
The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied bless either the 
chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for 
the parties' choice, or application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to the fundamental policy of a state 
having a greater material interest in the issue than the chosen state and such state would be the state of the applicable 
law in the absence of a choice by the parties.
