Theme #14: Volte-face - buy 6m EUR/EM-USD/EM vol spreads, sell EUR vs TRY, MXN, INR 
• 
Options markets assume the dollar will drive price 
action but the euro is now the "risk off" currency 
• 
"Euroglut" outflows into the US and EMFX reverse 
as risk appetite sours and carry trades squeeze 
• 
EUR/EM crosses have been realizing well above 
USD/EM but implied volatilities are quite similar 
• 
We recommend buying 6m EUR/EM - USD/EM 
volatility spreads in TRY, MXN. INR 
• 
For a directional view, express our EM 2016 
Outlook short EUR v. TRY, MXN and INR trade as a 
4m 97.5% worst-of put, a 2/3rd discount v. vanillas 
UM is the nevz risk appetite barometer 
Our FX strategy team has written extensively about 
"Euroglut" outflows into the U.S. and emerging 
markets (see FX Special Report 9-Dec-14 and 1-Dec-15). 
EUR increasingly adapts the hallmarks of safe haven 
currencies such as CHF and JPY; fixed income 
outflows (Figure 1) followed by sudden repatriation 
during positioning squeezes. Consequently, correlation 
between equities (a risk proxy) and EUR/USD has 
flipped since the Fed-driven USD rally (and ECB QE-
driven EUR sell-off) last year. The EUR TWI is now 
negatively correlated to the S&P 500 while the USD 
TWI is positively correlated to equities (Figure 2). 
We can also infer forward-looking market expectations 
of dollar-equities correlation by comparing implied 
volatility for USD-hedged and un-hedged international 
equity ETFs. 
In recent months fun-hedged) EFA 
volatility has traded 1-2% below both iShares hedged 
EFA (HEFA) and DB X-trackers hedged EFA (DBEF), 
suggesting the market expects the dollar will be 
positively correlated to global equities in the future 
(principally with respect to EUR, CHF and JPY). 
We should expect a similar result when looking for 
volatility in EMFX. 
Since EUR/USD is negatively 
correlated to equities (acting as risk proxy), we would 
expect EUR to be negative correlated with EMFX as 
well, making EUR/EM more volatile than USD/EM. 
Buy EUFflEkl volatility not USDIEM for an added fool. Of 
Indeed, EUR/EM is realizing higher, but implied 
volatility is not reflecting this at all. Figure 3 illustrates 
that EUR/EM and USD/EM 6-month implied volatility is 
priced roughly equal for much of EMFX, and where it is 
not (such as INR), the premium on EUR-cross volatility 
relative to USD-cross volatility is too low. As a result, 
while USDTRY, USDMXN and USDINR exhibit typically 
positive volatility risk premiums, EURTRY, EURMXN 
and EURINR volatility premiums are negative.
