AGP LP 519 Alpha Group Caudal Paul Barrett 
Disclosure Statement 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., acting through its Asset & Wealth Management division (the "Solicitation 
Agent"), Alkeon Capital Management, LLC (the -Adviser") and Alkeon Growth PW Partners, LP and Alkeon 
Growth Offshore Fund, Ltd. (the "Funds" and each a "Fund") have entered into an agreement pursuant to which 
the Solicitation Agent has agreed to consider the Solicitation Agent's clients and prospective clients for whom an 
investment in the Fund may be suitable and to refer such persons to the Adviser for potential subscription of 
interests in the Fund (the "Interests"). The Solicitation Agent is not affiliated with either the Fund or the Adviser. 
As compensation for these activities, the Solicitation Agent will receive from clients investing in the Fund 
a "Placement Fee" in an amount up to 2.5% of the gross investment in the Fund by each person referred by the 
Solicitation Agent to the Adviser. Further, the Solicitation Agent will receive from the Adviser a "Solicitation 
Fee" equal to 50% of the Management Fees (as defined in the Fund's Offering Memorandum) to be received by 
the Adviser with respect to the value of the aggregate investments made by such persons (after deduction of any 
Placement Fees paid or payable to the Solicitation Agent) in the Fund. Other than the foregoing fees, no additional 
fees or other amounts will be charged to investors by the Fund as a result of the Solicitation Agent's involvement. 
Investors in the Fund that are referred by the Solicitation Agent to the Adviser will not pay increased Management 
Fees or other similar compensation to the Solicitation Agent, the Adviser or the Fund as a result of the referral. 
Given the existence of the compensation arrangements described above, the Solicitation Agent may 
benefit financially from referring clients to the Fund rather than to other competitive hedge funds or other products 
that may also be appropriate for particular clients. As a result, the Solicitation Agent's receipt of such payments 
from the Funds or the Adviser creates a potential conflict of interest in the form of an additional financial incentive 
to the Solicitation Agent. its equity owners and investment representatives to refer clients to the Fund. In addition, 
the Solicitation Agent or its affiliates may earn compensation from the Funds or their affiliates through 
arrangements that may or may not directly involve the Solicitation Agent, such as the provision of brokerage or 
prime brokerage services or research. Employees of the Solicitation Agent or its affiliates, including their 
investment representatives who may offer Interests to clients, may now or in the future own Interests in the Fund.
