7. Ms Ny has not decided to prosecute Mr Assange because she has not yet disclosed the file to 
Mm. 
8. The defence says the importance of the test as set out in Ismail cannot be over-emphasised. 
The test, as set out by Lord Steyn in that case, is: "For my pan I am satisfied that the Divisional 
Court in this case posed the right test by addressing the broad question whether the competent 
authorities in the foreign jurisdiction had taken a step which can fairly be described as the 
commencement of the prosecution". Here the prosecution cannot point to anything that can 
fairly be described as the commencement of a prosecution. On the contrary such a step has not 
been taken because preliminary investigation is "ring-fenced against a prosecution decision by 
virtue of section 20 of chapter 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code". 
9. In any event the issuance of the EAW was disproportionate. 
In the defence skeleton argument, and opening, their position was that their client was sought simply in order to 
facilitate his questioning and without having yet reached a decision as to whether or not to prosecute him. They 
said that Ms Ny's claim that all the "normal procedures for getting an interrogation" had been "exhausted" is 
highly inaccurate. It was said that Mr Huttig had repeatedly sought to make Mr Assangc available to Ms Ny for 
questioning, but all these efforts were rebuffed. They quoted from Mr Hurtig•. "I can confirm on behalf of Mr 
Assange 1 have been trying for many weeks to arrange for him to be questioned by Ms Ny, including by Mr 
Assange returning to Sweden for questioning. All these attempts have been rebuffed by her. A number of 
media clippings were relied on to show that Ms Ny's repeated position is that she is seeking extradition merely to 
conduct an interview with Mr Assangc with no decision having been taken on whether to charge or prosecute 
him. Reference is also made to Brita Sundberg-Weitman and her opinion, based on her experience and on the 
facts set out in the warrant and facts described by Mr Hurtig. These are that the application for an EAW was 
manifestly disproportionate and her opinion is that the application was an attempt to bring Mr Assange to 
Sweden for questioning rather than prosecution. 
Against that, Ms Ny explains her position in her information dated 4th February 2011. She says: 
B. The aim of the EAW 
5. Julian Assange's surrender is sought in order that he may be subject to criminal proceedings. 
6. A domestic warrant for the respondent's arrest was upheld on 24th November 2010 by the Court 
of Appeal, Sweden. An arrest warrant was issued on the basis that Julian Assange is accused 
with probable cause of the offences outlined on the EAW. 
7. According to Swedish law, a formal decision to indict may not be taken at the stage that the 
criminal process is currently at. Julian Assange's case is currently at the stage of "preliminary 
investigation". It will only be concluded when Julian Assangc is surrendered to Sweden and 
has been interrogated. 
8. The purpose of a preliminary investigation is to investigate the crime, provide underlying 
material on which to base a decision concerning prosecution and prepare the case so that all 
evidence can be presented at trial. Once the decision to indict has been made, an indictment is 
filed with the court. In the case of a person in pre-trial detention, the trial must commence 
within two weeks. Once started, the trial may not be adjourned. It can therefore be seen that 
the formal decision to indict is made at an advanced stage of the criminal proceedings. There
