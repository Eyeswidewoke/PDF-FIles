have no New York trustees, no properly located in New York, and no New York-source income). 
Second. the bill would eliminate a loophole" that allows so-called incomplete gift, non-grantor trusts 
("INGs" or "DINGs,- if the trusts are created in Delaware) to completely avoid New York income tax; it 
would do so by making the trust a "grantor trust" for New York income tax purposes — meaning that the 
creator of the trust would be taxable on the trust's income for New York purposes. even though the 
creator is not taxable on that income for federal purposes. Although these proposals would be 
retroactive to January 1, 2014 if enacted. some transition rules would apply: accumulation distributions 
paid before June 1. 2014 would be exempt, and the ING rules would not apply to income from a trust 
that is liquidated before June 1, 2014. 
Comments. This proposed legislation reflects recommendations from the Trusts and Estates section of 
the New York Bar Association that were included in the November 2013 report from the Tax Reform and 
Fairness Commission. According to the bill's supporting memorandum, the provisions would increase 
tax revenues by $75 million in fiscal year 2014-15, $225 million in fiscal year 2015-16, and $150 million 
annually thereafter. In other words, these proposals are perceived as money-makers. Yet whether that 
would indeed be the case remains to be seen: wealthy New Yorkers seem unlikely to view these 
changes as 'improvements" to the taxation of trusts, but rather, as another reason to move out of New 
York.
