• 
Humanitarian issues: what steps be taken to improve disaster risk reduction? What can be done 
to improve the humanitarian response to displacement and famine, particularly in relation to 
health? 
• 
Food and water security: how can vulnerability to food and water insecurity be reduced for the 
more than 1 billion people who are starving and/or lack access to clean water? 
• 
Development: how can development increase resilience to ill-health, and what steps can be 
taken to create a virtuous cycle between improved healthcare and increased development, 
particularly in the post 2015 Development Agenda? 
• 
Conflict prevention: how can conflict prevention, mediation, and peacebuilding reduce the 
impact of conflict on health and development, particularly in fragile states? 
• 
Transnational threats: what can be done to reduce the threat posed by organized crime to 
health—for example, in relation to counterfeit medicines, and crime-related violence? 
• 
Sustainable urbanization: what steps can be taken to improve the chances of implementing the 
Millennium Development Goals in cities, and what lessons can be learned from safer, rather than 
failing, cities? 
This work will map global trends and compile information on areas of vulnerability, drawing on IPI's 
strategic assessments, its Global Observatory, and mapping skills. It will also look at how technology can 
be used to reduce threats and enhance resilience. 
For each issue area, IPI will look at best practices and successful case studies in order to identify factors 
that promote resilience. The aim is to carry out evidence-based research and assist policy-makers in 
order to have an impact on policy. 
Working with a wide range of experts from the private sector, academic institutions, think tanks, civil 
society, specialized institutions, inter-governmental organizations, and all levels of government, IPI will 
develop a series of operational recommendations on how to strengthen resilience in the areas of focus. 
In the process, it will help strengthen networks among actors from a cross-section of backgrounds. These 
connections can enable more effective prevention, and a quicker response during times of crisis. 
III. ALIGNMENT WITH STRATEGY: 
Aligns to BMGF goal to eradicate polio as part of Global Development Program: 
The BMGF has a proven track record of promoting strategies that aid in the fight to eradicate polio. The 
IPI project aligns to these strategies most closely in the areas of the polio vaccination campaigns and 
legacy planning. The project has the potential to be a pivotal tool in achieving the BMGF priority of 
improving the quality of campaigns in Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia, as well as other areas 
of Africa that are at risk of polio importation. Specifically, it can improve the BMGF's understanding of 
local social, cultural, political, and religious barriers to improving vaccination coverage, and identifying 
entry points to overcome these obstacles, engaging local stakeholders and communities. Also, IPI 
supports the sanctuary model, emphasizing quality over quantity in vaccination campaigns. This is also 
important in order to avoid vaccination fatigue. Some children are immunized again and again, until the 
families cease to believe it does any good—and then they start refusing. The small number of polio cases 
requires mapping exercises and immunization campaigns to pinpoint which children are not being
