785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, "; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
59; see also United States v. Goforth, 465 F.3d 730, 737 (6th Cir. 2006) (observing that 
[HN29] "where an argument advanced in an appellant's opening brief applies to and 
essentially subsumes an alternative basis for affirmance not separately argued therein, the 
appellant does not waive that alternative basis for affirmance"). The district court based its 
conclusion that common issues did not predominate on the observation that because the 
workers' evidence disproportionately concerns the Beam Mill, "there is no 'glue' connecting 
the promotions decisions in the Beam Mill to the decisions in the other departments." J.A. 
10959. That is exactly the same argument raised, and responded to by the workers, in the 
context of Rule 23(a)(2) commonality. See J.A. [*61] 10950-54; Appellants' Br. 42-47. 
Elsewhere in its Rule 23(b)(3) discussion, the court observes that lajlthough there are, to 
varying degrees, a few allegations of discrimination in promotions in departments other 
than the Beam Mill, there is nothing to link these allegations to the pattern of behavior 
alleged in the Beam Mill." J.A. 10959. Again, this argument is also made in the Rule 
23(a)(2) context and responded to in detail by the workers there. Indeed, the district court 
itself acknowledged that it "employ[ed] the language of Wal-Mart" regarding Rule 23(a)(2) 
in discussing the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). J.A. 10958-59. In responding directly to 
the reasons given by the district court for its predominance determination, the workers 
have thus done far more than take a mere "passing shot at the issue." See Belk, Inc. v. 
Meyer Corp., 679 F.3d 146, 152 n.4 (4th Cir. 2012) (finding that an issue was waived after 
a party mentioned the issue in a heading but failed to further develop the argument); see 
also Williams v. Woodford, 384 F.3d 567, 587 n.5 (9th Cir. 2002) (concluding that an 
appellant preserved a claim for review even though the argument consisted of "eight 
sentences in a footnote," where the argument identified the basis of disagreement with the 
district court, the requested relief, and relevant citations to case law and the record). 
23 Even superficially, the district r62] court includes its predominance analysis under the heading of "Subjectivity as a Policy." 
dovetailing a discussion of commonality. instead of as a separate section of analysis. See J.A 10954. 10956. 
Nonetheless, the dissent argues that "many different reasons underlay [the district court's] 
predominance finding, including several individual questions that could 'overwhelm' 
common ones." Post at 69. But a plain reading of the district court's opinion belies the idea 
that it made any predominance arguments that were not responded to by the workers. The 
only specific argument cited by the dissent as unaddressed contends that because of the 
workers' reliance on anecdotal evidence, a jury "would have to delve into the merits of 
each individual promotion decision." J.A. 10959; post at 69. Yet, as observed above, the 
workers specifically argued that the anecdotal evidence establishes "common claims of 
discrimination" that merit certification, not merely a finding of commonality. ['92O] 
Appellants' Br. 42 (quoting Brown I, 576 F.3d at 153). Indeed, such an argument is 
consistent with the workers' fundamental contention throughout their brief that plant-wide 
discrimination existed. 
As this Court has observed, [HN30] the purpose of the waiver ("63] doctrine is to avoid 
unfairness to an appellee and minimize the "risk of an improvident or ill-advised opinion 
being issued on an unbriefed issue." United States v. Leeson, 453 F.3d 631, 638 n.4 (4th 
Cir. 2006) (citing McBride v. Merrell Dow & Pharm., Inc., 800 F.2d 1208, 1211, 255 U.S. 
App. D.C. 183 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). Given the briefing presented, the fully developed record
