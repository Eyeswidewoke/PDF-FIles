October 17, 2013 --=Sometime next week, Egypt's military-run government will publish the "=irst draft" of a new 
constitution to replace the one worked out by the g=vernment of the ousted President Mohamed Morsi. 
The coup that retur=ed the military to power after a year-long interval was presented as an at=empt to prevent the 
Muslim Brotherhood from imposing an Islamist dictators=ip with a constitutional facade. Highlighted were two articles 
in the Morsi constitution that identified the Islamic sh=ria as the source of legislation in Egypt and gave Al-Azhar, the 
official =eminary, a virtual veto on certain issues. 
The crowds that for=weeks filled Tahrir Square called on the army to intervene to save the nat=on from a burgeoning 
sharia-based -dictatorship. Well, when the new draf= constitution — written by a 50-man committee appointed by the 
military — is published, the Tahrir Square crowds are l=kely to be disappointed. The two controversial articles will still be 
ther=, albeit under different numbers and with slight changes in terminology.4=pan> 
"Egyptians want t= retain their Islamic identity," says Kamal Halbawi, a former Brotherhoo= member who co-chaired the 
army-appointed drafting committee with Amr Mous=a, a former foreign minister during the earlier military 
governments. 
Thus Islamists, inc=uding the Salafist Nour ( Light) Party sponsored by Saudi Arabia will have=no reason to be unhappy 
with the proposed draft. 
The difference this=time is that the new constitution also gives the military what the text dr=fted by Morsi denied it. The 
armed forces will get recognition for their =93special status" and given a virtual veto on key aspects of security, foreign 
and even economic policies. 
The Supreme Council=of the Armed Forces, the junta formed after Hosni Mubarak's ouster, will=be recognized as a 
constitutionally sanctioned state organ with "special=responsibilities and prerogatives," including the appointment of 
the defense minister and the supervision of the militar= budget, which will be spared public submission to the 
parliament.<=p> 
Put brutally, the p=oposed draft constitution is a pact between a section of the military led =y Gen. Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi 
and a section of the Islamic movement spearhea=ed by Salafists. 
The faction led by =isi represents a segment of the officers' corps reluctant to abandon a s=stem under which the army 
acted as a state within the state and seized con=rol of perhaps 20 percent of the national economy. As always during the 
past 100 years, the military is using a pseu=o-nationalistic discourse full of xenophobic shibboleths. 
The Salafist factio= hopes to seize the opportunity of its collaboration with the military to =uild its position within the 
Islamist constituency. With the Muslim Brothe=hood banned and most of its leaders under arrest, the Salafists hope to 
seduce some of their followers, especi=lly with the help of a deluge of Saudi money. 
However, even when =hey add their respective bases of support, the Sisi faction of the militar= and the Salafist faction 
do not represent more than a third of the Egypti=n electorate. 
The two factions ca= dominate the organs of the state and exercise power only if they stick to=ether. They hope to do so 
with the proposed constitution, which is a rehas=ed version of an old recipe for despotism. 
This is the recipe =he interim government has followed in a series of incremental moves that i=clude reimposing the 50-
year-old state of emergency, enacting new laws on =ublic gatherings and reviving special tribunals acting as star 
chambers outside the normal legal systems.=/p>
