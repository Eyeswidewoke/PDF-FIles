S-I/A 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders may only remove a director for cause by a 
vote of no less than a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or by proxy at a meeting for the election of 
directors and entitled to vote. 
Director Vacancies 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes only our board of directors to fill vacant directorships. 
No Cumulative Voting 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders do not have the right to cumulate votes in 
the election of directors. 
Special Meetings of Stockholders 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that, except as otherwise 
required by law, special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by an officer at the request of a majority of our board of 
directors, by the chairman of the board of directors, or by our Chief Executive Officer (or President in the absence of a Chief 
Executive Officer). 
Advance Notice Procedures for Director Nominations 
Our amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to nominate candidates for 
election as directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders. Although our amended and restated bylaws do not give the 
board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates to be elected at an annual meeting, 
our amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper 
procedures are not followed or may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own 
slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.

Action by Written Consent 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that any action to be taken 
by the stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by written 
consent. 
Amending our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended or altered in any manner provided by the Delaware 
General Corporation Law (DGCL), provided that the amendment of certain provisions (including those described above) will require 
the approval of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the 
election of directors. Our amended and restated bylaws may be adopted, amended, altered, or repealed by stockholders upon the 
approval of at least a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the 
election of directors, provided that the amendment of certain provisions (including those described above) will require the approval 
of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of 
directors. Additionally, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our bylaws may be adopted, amended, 
altered, or repealed by the board of directors. 
Authorized but Unissued Shares 
Our authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuances 
without stockholder approval, except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, and could be utilized 
for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions, and employee benefit 
plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or 
discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger, or otherwise.
