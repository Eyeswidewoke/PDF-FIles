experts' findings. The workers' experts limited the records they analyzed to the same 
positions identified in the later period when bidding data was available, positions for which 
there was a black bidder. J.A. 1161-62. In its original order denying certification, the district 
court observed that the assumptions regarding bidding "may be reasonable and the 
statistics based thereon may be relevant to prove discrimination at the plant," but "the 
necessity of the assumptions diminishes their probative value."" J.A. 8987; see also Brown 
I, 576 F.3d at 156. As we previously r*24] concluded, [HN12] an incremental reduction in 
probative value -- which is a natural consequence of the use of proxy data -- does not itself 
render a statistical study unreliable in establishing a question of discrimination common to 
the class. Brown I, 576 F.3d at 156. Indeed, to conclude otherwise would undermine our 
prior precedent in cases like Lewis and Fairfax, rendering plaintiffs unable to bring a 
statistics-based employment discrimination claim after a company has intentionally or 
inadvertently destroyed actual applicant data." See Lewis, 773 F.2d at 568; Fairfax, 629 
F.2d at 940. 
10 After we pointed to this language in Brown I, the district court did an about-face and changed its conclusion to state that the 
statistics were 'fundamentally unreliable.' J.A. 10941. 
11 The workers experts acknowledged that the incomplete data "undermined" their "ability to use posting and bidding records 
to analyze (those] promotions." J.A. 1161. In context, hawever, the experts were lamenting the failure of Nucor to "produce all 
such records." J.A. 1161. As the experts concluded. they were able to "calculate reliable statistics" for the limited universe of 
positions they analyzed. even though greater discovery would have allowed them to make a more 'powerful" study of plantwide 
r251 disparities. J.A. 1253-54; see also J.A 1340-41.

The dissent points to still more statistical assumptions -- assumptions not discussed by 
either the district court or Nucor -- to further question the reliability of the alternative 
benchmark. Specifically, the dissent suggests that the black workers may not have been 
qualified for higher paying jobs and that they may have been denied promotions because 
of disciplinary records that were not themselves the result of racial animus. See post at 
111, 114-17. As to the qualifications of the workers, Nucor identifies nothing in the record -
- or in any factual findings by the district court - to suggest that black workers regularly 
applied for jobs for which they were not qualified, such that the reliability of the study would 
be compromised. Indeed, the Nucor job postings explicitly listed the minimum 
qualifications required, and the workers' experts reasonably assumed that individuals 
would normally apply only if they believe they met such qualifications. See J.A. 7763 (an 
example of a job posting); J.A. 1162. That is not to say that patently unqualified workers 
did not apply in isolated cases. But there is no reason to believe that such incidents ("26] 
would have substantially reduced the reliability of the statistical conclusions. It also bears 
repeating that it was Nucor that failed to retain or produce records that would have allowed 
the experts to take other variables like qualifications more precisely into account. See J.A. 
1165. 
r9O7] The dissent, however, goes a step further in speculating that black workers may 
have been denied promotions because of their disciplinary records. See post at 111. 
Again, Nucor itself does not make this argument. Instead, the argument the dissent
