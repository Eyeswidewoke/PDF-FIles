2. Whether the Lease Permitted OFM to Unreasonably Withhold Written 
Consent to a Proposed Sublet 
The last issue to be decided on this motion is whether OFM was entitled to 
refuse Epstein's proposed sublet to Fisher arbitrarily, or whether it breached a duty of 
good faith and fair dealing implicit in the lease agreement by unreasonably refusing to 
grant such consent in writing. Resolution of this issue turns on whether federal 
contract law or New York landlord-tenant law applies. 
*7 Generally, under New York law, where a lease requires a tenant to obtain the 
prior written consent of the landlord to sublet or assign leased premises, a landlord 
may refuse consent arbitrarily, unless the lease contains a clause specifically stating 
that the landlord may not unreasonably withhold such consent. See Dress Shirt Sales, 
Inc. v. Hotel Martinique Assocs., 12 N.Y.2d 339, 239 N.Y.S.2d 660, 662, 190 N.E.2d 10 
(Ct.App.1963). The Assignment and Sublet Clause in the lease between OFM and 
Epstein required Epstein to obtain prior written consent of OFM to a proposed sublet, 
but it contained no provision prohibiting OFM from unreasonably withholding such 
written consent. 
The Government, relying on New York landlord-tenant law, asserts that it was 
entitled to withhold its consent to Epstein's proposed sublet to Fisher for any reason, or 
for no reason at all. Epstein and Fisher, however, disagree. They contend that, 
because the Government is a party to the lease, interpretation of the lease is governed 
by principles of federal common law, not New York State law. Pursuant to federal 
common law of contracts, Epstein and Fisher continue, the lease between OFM and 
Epstein contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, citing Neal & Co. v. 
United States, 36 Fed. Cl. 600 (1996), aff'd, 121 F.3d 683 (Fed.Cir.1997). The 
requirement of good faith and fair dealing, they argue, prohibits OFM from withholding 
consent unreasonably. OFM's refusal to consent to Epstein's proposed sublet of the 
Premises to Fisher, they contend, was motivated by its desire to enter into a lease with 
Galinas at a higher rent beginning February 1, 1997. Such conduct was unreasonable, 
they argue, and, therefore, OFM breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing in the lease. 
I conclude that New York landlord-tenant law rather than general federal 
contract principles should apply. As a threshold matter, although I agree as a policy 
matter that federal law should apply, there is no federal statutory or common law 
governing landlord-tenant relations. Federal law should apply because the United 
States is a party. I have jurisdiction over this action based on 28 U.S.C. s 1345 and the 
FMA, 22 U.S.C. s 4301 et seq. The subject matter of this action is a landlord-tenant 
dispute, however, and while application of federal law is appropriate in federal question 
cases where applicable federal substantive law exists, there is no federal statutory or 
common law of landlord and tenant. Powers v. United States Postal Serv., 671 F.2d 
1041, 1042, 1045 (7th Cir.1982); Reed v. United States Postal Serv., 660 F.Supp. 178, 
181 (D.Mass.1987). The question remains, therefore, what law applies in the absence 
of a federal rule on point. 
As the Supreme Court has made clear, my power to create federal common law 
in the absence of federal landlord-tenant law is limited. Several recent Supreme Court 
decisions have reaffirmed the principle that the power of the federal courts to fashion 
principles of federal common law is limited. See, e.g., O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC,
