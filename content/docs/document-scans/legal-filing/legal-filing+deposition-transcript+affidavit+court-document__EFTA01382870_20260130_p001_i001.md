Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officer.. 
Section 102(bX7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") allows a corporation to provide in its cell Ificate of 
incorporation that a director of the corporation will not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach 
of fiduciary• duty as a director, except where the director breached the duty of loyalty, failed to act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct 
or knowingly violated a law, authorized the payment of a dividend or approved a stock repurchase in violation of Delaware corporate law or 
obtained an improper personal benefit. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide for this limitation of liability. We will 
enter into indemnification agreements with our director nominees that provide for us to indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware

proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. A Delaware corporation may indemnify any persons who

is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or enterprise. The indemnity may include expenses (including attorneys' 
fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit, provided such person
