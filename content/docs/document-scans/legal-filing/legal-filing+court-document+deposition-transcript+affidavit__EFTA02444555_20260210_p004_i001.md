The Whiteside. Lab 
think about research and think about the field that we are collectively in. Thus, if we work on 
something and 10 years later we find that no other people are working on that kind of 
research, or the techniques have not been promulgated, or the ideas have not extended beyond 
the lab, then our effort has been a failure. Our lab has to think about the problem in terms of 
something that will make a difference: the problem has to be interesting enough so that other 
people will think about working on it themselves. And the lab has also to think about the full 
spectrum of activities, which range from picking the problem to selling the solution at the end. 
Whitesides saw that making an impact was the product of two vectors: the quality of papers 
coming out of the lab and quantity of papers. He explained, 
The reason is that you are not going anywhere unless you have good ideas but if you have 
one good idea only, and you publish one terrific paper, it usually disappears. A little bit of 
advertising to show how the content of the paper can be used is necessary. You have to 
disseminate the ideas in different communities and for each field you have to try to identify 
relevant examples and test cases where your research could be applied. 
The approach to scientific discovery that Whitesides used was 'butterfly-like'. As he explained, 
"We move from flower to flower, into a problem with a fairly large number of people, work on it 
intensively for some years, and then move out into some other area."3 'Going after big ideas' was one 
of the lab's mottos. Many other academics saw this as high-risk research, especially for students and 
postdocs starting their careers. Yet, Whitesides held the opposite view: 
By working on problems that are original, you minimize risk. If you work on an important 
and interesting problem, you get a lot of credit since you are going off in a new direction and 
you are also showing something that is unexplored and neat. And this is true also in the case 
you solve only part of the problem... On the other hand, if you work on issues that are routine, 
nobody really cares whether you succeed or fail, and thus you get no credit in either case. This 
argument, I think, holds both at the university and in industry. 
How Ideas are Generated and Work Gets Done 
The lab used classical and state-of-the-art techniques to research topics at the boundaries between 
chemistry, biology, solid-state physics, and engineering. The lab was renowned globally for its 
publications, graduates, and creative concepts. Over 900 papers had been published, mainly in top 
journals such as Nature, Science, the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the Journal of Organic 
Chemistry, and the Journal of Physical Chemistry (see Exhibit 6). The publication process served as a 
powerful organizing and communication mechanism for the research results derived from the team 
projects conducted in the lab.4 Teams varied in size but usually contained two to seven members. 
Two-member teams were rare. Nobody worked on a project alone except at its initiation. Each 
working group researched several themes, usually four to six, which were considered strategic 
thrusts: areas with potential for major discoveries. Teams were entrepreneurial, learned from others 
in the lab, and developed their own tactics for dealing with each new research problem, often without 
Whitesides' guidance. While the general research direction came from Whitesides, details were left to 
the lab members. Weibel commented,

4 Most papers were published in journals that had rigorous peer-review processes and were assumed to critically evaluate both 
ideas and research methods.
