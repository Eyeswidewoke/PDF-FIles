UBS CIO Monthly Letter 
The US has not run a budget surplus since 2001, and the 
accumulation of deficits since then has raised federal 
debt to more than 100% of GDP, the highest in over 60 
years (see Figure 2). When the present value of social 
security and healthcare liabilities for the coming three 
decades is taken into account, analysts estimate the 
debt-to-GDP ratio will climb to more than 300%. 
While a highly accommodative central bank and the 
safe-haven status of US government bonds are currently 
helping the government fund its deficit at historically low 
rates, such a benign environment will not last forever. 
Among other steps, it will be critical to reduce healthcare 
costs, since projected spending on Medicare makes up 
over half of the US government's future liabilities. 
It is clear the US has to get its fiscal house in order. 
However, there is a danger that excessive fiscal tighten-
ing in the near term could cause a recession. The most 
pressing issue for the newly elected Congress will be to 
resolve the "fiscal cliff." Without an agreement between 
Democrats and Republicans, USD 607 billion (3.7% of 
GDP) of spending cuts and tax increases will be triggered 
in January. We believe that the most likely outcome is a 
"fiscal pothole," rather than a plunge over the fiscal cliff, 
e.g. a deal to incrementally reduce the government defi-
cit by c.0.7% of GDP. This would likely slow the econ-
omy, but not tip the US into recession. 
If confidence is to return in a sustainable manner, politi-
cians will need to pivot quickly to credible, longer-term 
deficit reduction plans in 2013. The choices made over 
how to redefine the social contract will have critical 
implications for the investment landscape. 
What this means for an investor today. A risk remains that 
politicians may be willing to push the US over the fiscal 
cliff, potentially using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip, 
before negotiations reach an acceptable compromise. The 
markets are not pricing in this result and, to be clear, it is

not our baseline expectation. Still, given the binary nature 
of the risk and the fact that in an election year politicians 
can act less rationally than usual, it seems logical not to 
add risk at this point in time. Furthermore, after an 
extended period of inventory re-stocking, uncertainty over 
the US political situation and global growth has led busi-
nesses to manage stocks more tightly and limit capital 
investment. These factors could prove to be somewhat of 
a drag during the ongoing third quarter earnings season. 
Eurozone — debt only made worse by demographics 
In Europe, looming demographic pressures are even 
more severe than in the US. For example, by 2050, 40% 
of Portugal's population will be over the age of 60, sec-
ond only to Japan in its ratio of elderly citizens. Italy, 
Spain and Germany will be close behind at 38%, all 
among the oldest populations in the world. The rapid 
pace of aging raises the urgency of finding a sustainable 
solution to Europe's sovereign debt crisis. 
There are essentially two ways to achieve debt sustainabil-
ity: fiscal austerity, or higher GDP growth. Peripheral coun-
tries have been forced to emphasize the former. As a result, 
the news is full of headlines about budget cuts, tax hikes, 
pension and salary cuts for public workers, and increases in 
the retirement age. As continued violent street protests in 
Greece and Spain attest the social contract is under threat. 
Also, over the past few months, a debate has intensified 
over whether fiscal austerity could actually be harming 
debt sustainability by undermining growth prospects. The 
International Monetary Fund recently stated that since the 
start of the great recession, fiscal austerity has been more 
contractionary than many had expected. 
A huge gap in competitiveness between the core and the 
periphery is at the root of the Eurozone's problems. Ger-
man labor costs rose by +18% in 2000-2009, significantly 
less than Italy's +35% and Spain's +50%. Our estimates 
suggest that Italy and Spain would require a -20% real 
exchange rate adjustment, while Portugal and Greece 
would need more than —30% to get labor costs back on an
