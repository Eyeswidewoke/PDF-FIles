Securities acquired before 2011 a in retirement accounts are generaly not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended rIRC") (incorporating 
amendments enacted by P.L.110-343. the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are, therefore, considered "noncovered." under the new cost basis reporting rules, and marked or denoted as such. 
All other securities in this section we securities which are "covered" under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are "covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as 
non-retirement, US taxpayers securities which have been acquired on or after their "applicable date(s)' at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis will be reported to the IRS 
on form 1099-B for the applicable tax year in which the security is disposed.

• 
Options and any Debt Instruments that provide a simple food payment schedule for which a yield to maturity can be easily determined acquired on or after January 1, 2014. 
This Schedule may not reflect all cost basis adjustments necessary for tax reporting purposes, especially for noncovered securities. Adjustments to cost basis may have been made for prior income received and 
subsequently reclassified by the issuer as a return of capital In addition, corporate action events may require adjustments to your original cost basis. Return of capital information and cost basis information, as 
it relates to corporate actions. has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. 
Adjustments to cost basis can be made after year-end, in particular, for retum of capital adjustments. but may also include adjustments for corporate action events. Therefore there may be differences in cost 
basis reflected on your monthly cbent brokerage statement at year end versus any subsequent reports, including your 1099-8 or online displays you may have available to you.
