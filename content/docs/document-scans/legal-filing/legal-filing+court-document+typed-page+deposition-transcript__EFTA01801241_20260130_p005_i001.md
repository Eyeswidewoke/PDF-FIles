for reassurances that a renewed rigour from supervisors will fix the problem. The proxies f=r culture are going to be pay 
and senior accountability, and these are the=two things that ultimately tripped up Mr Diamond at Barclays. Althou=h 
many in banking would like to argue that these things are beside the point, politically they are the point. 
Like much else in the current banking model, the case for=remuneration levels in banking is based purely on the 
logic and discipline=of the free market for financial services. Yet the bailouts of 2008 and th= LIBOR-fixing scandal have 
further exhausted political and regulatory patience with the idea that banking exi=ts in a free market. High levels of 
remuneration are also glaringly at odd= with the wider economic context and the prevailing political climate. Geo=ge 
Osborne, the British Chancellor, has tried to accommodate London-based investment banks by resisting the ra=her rigid 
rules inserted at the last minute by the European Parliament int= the European CRD4 Directive applying ratios for fixed 
and bonus pay at Eu=opean banks. But in doing so he is well aware that he is badly out of step with the public mood. 
The accountability problem is as simple and blunt as poli=ics gets. The massive market disruptions of 2008 and 
the ensuing economic =risis have created a latent political desire for personal accountability f=om the banking industry 
that it has so far been unable to meet. In part this is because the most egregiously m=naged institutions in the period 
leading up to 2008 have simply disappeare=. The survivors are generally not inclined to feel implicated in the indus=ry's 
wider collective problems. Mr Diamond always seemed to hint at the indignation of an executive whose =ank had 
survived the banking crisis without direct government support and =ho felt he had little to answer for, at least until his 
employees' malpr=ctice made this untenable. This is part of what made him such a lightning rod and figure of 
resentment for ma=y politicians. 
The political fal=out 
How will this play out politically? The UK's Labour opp=sition has clearly judged that there is mileage in a 
renewed campaign agai=st the bankers. However, although Labour supports a tightening of the gove=nment's proposed 
rules on derivatives inside the ringfence for British retail banks proposed for 2013, its ultim=te aim is not a particular 
regulatory outcome but something closer to a mo=al posture on capitalism. Labour leader Ed Miliband has broadly 
disowned t=e banking record of the Labour government before 2010 and has put a "better, improved capitalism" at =he 
heart of his election platform. This is achieving some resonance in thermedia. His aim is to use a moral and ethical 
critique of banking as a way =f differentiating himself and the Labour party both from its own past and the Conservative-
led Coalition government= The Coalition government inevitably will be forced to cover the same grou=d. 
The Conservative party is much less inclined to make a mo=al issue of banking, still less of capitalism more 
widely. However, most o= the very small number of genuinely forensic critics of the banking sector=in the UK Parliament 
are Tories, and often individuals with financial services backgrounds. The Chancellor =eorge Osborne currently seems 
more inclined to use the LIBOR issue as an o=portunity to attack Labour's record in government, but if other banks ar= 
fined and the Parliamentary enquiry is highly critical, then he will have to tack to stay close enough to the =ublic mood. 
His own backbenchers have already started to grumble that he h=s misjudged the LIBOR scandal by playing it for politics 
rather than a que=tion of principle and policy. 
For an industry that is used to justifying its social rol= largely in terms of taxes paid and jobs created, this is 
difficult territ=ry. Assuming that banks accept that there is a need seriously to tac=le and talk about internal culture, 
providing evidence of this response is not easy. It will require bank leaders who ar= more visible, vocal and accountable, 
and internal management that is will=ng to pit the long term interests of institutions against the short-term c=lture of 
the trading floor. 
For boards, and in particular the many non-executive boar= members of banks charged with providing external 
oversight of institution=l conduct and compensation, this adds both additional responsibility and a=ditional exposure. It 
will require a keen political ear. But it will also require politicians and regulators =o engage in a more subtle debate
