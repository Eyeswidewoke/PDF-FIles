emanating from fragile states= While states have well-established theories for pursuing traditional poli=ical-military 
ends with diplomacy and force, the United States possesses no proven models for achieving prog=ess in the social, 
psychological, and environmental costs of an integratin= globe areas such as regional instability, terrorism, the 
complexities of =evelopment, radicalism, aggressive nationalism, organized crime, resource shortages, and ecological 
degradati=n.17 For half a century, the United States was a dominant global power whi=h identified challenging core 
goals and tasks deterring military adventuri=m, building political-military alliances, erecting mutually-beneficial 
institutions of trade but to which=Washington could apply established models and techniques. U.S. leadership =nd 
power becomes much more problematic in a world of complex problems whic= generate no broad agreement and which 
subject themselves to no clear solutions. 
Fifth and finally, e=en as America's power projection instruments have become less usable and e=fective, the American 
people have grown less willing to use them. A 2009 p=ll by the Pew Research Center found that 49 percent of those 
surveyed, an all-time record, said that the Unite= States should "mind its own business internationally and let other 
count=ies get along the best they can on their own." That number jumped from 30=percent in 2002.18 Those who favor 
a powerful American leadership role in the world have also declined in Gal=up polling. For example, the percentage fell 
from 75 in 2009 to 66 in mid-=011, while the percentage advocating a far more minimal U.S. role grew fro= 23 percent 
to 32 percent.19 Over 40 percent of Americans now say the country spends too much on defense, co=pared with less 
than a quarter who say it spends too little.20 Many Americ=ns want their nation to remain a global leader,21 but the 
public is less e=amored with the massive expenditures and national efforts necessary to sustain the existing paradigm. 
The Risks of Stra=egic Bankruptcy 
The default response=to looming failures in strategic posture has so far been, and will likely =ontinue to be, to chip away 
at its edges and avoid exhausting fundamental =eform. Some would argue that persistence, or incremental change, is 
the best course: avoiding the risks to U.S. cred=bility, to the international system, to the domestic political health of 
w=atever administration waded into it of recalibrating U.S. power in the for= of cascading loss of faith in American 
credibility.22 This is a mistake; in fact, refusing to come to to=ms with U.S. strategic insolvency will damage U.S. 
credibility and global =tability to a far greater degree. A well-managed readjustment will better =void the pitfalls of 
strategic insolvency.23 Persisting without reform substantially increases the risk o= a number of specific strategic perils. 
Global strategies an= specific military plans lose credibility. As the leading power is overtak=n by others, if it refuses to 
prioritize and attempts instead to uphold al= its commitments equally, the credibility of its regional plans, postures, and 
threats is destined to erode. Recent =iterature on credibility argues that it is not based merely on past action=, but from 
an adversary's calculations of the current power capabilities a= a state's disposal.24 When Hitler's Germany was 
considering whether to take seriously the pledges and commitme=ts of the Western allies, for example, he paid much 
more attention to thei= existing capabilities, their current national will, and the perceived fea=ibility of their strategic 
posture than to reputations formed over years or decades of actions. Indeed, such =udgments seem to derive not from a 
checklist of a rival's defense programs=or military actions, but from a much more diffuse and visceral sense of th= 
trajectory of a state's power relative to its current posture. What is now clear is that the consensus o= such perceptions 
is shifting decisively against the tenability of the exi=ting U.S. paradigm of global power projection. It is, in fact, natural 
for=rising challengers to see weakness in the leading power's capacities as a by-product of the growing self-conf=dence 
and faith in their own abilities. There is already abundant evidence=of such perceptual shifts in the assertive leaders and 
elites of rising po=ers today, who while respecting continuing U.S. strengths and expecting the United States to remain 
the pr=mus inter pares for decades to come, perhaps indefinitely nonetheless see =urrent U.S. global commitments as 
excessive for a debt-ridden and "declin=ng" power. 
In China, as a leadi=g example, senior officials and influential analysts view the United State= as troubled, overextended, 
and increasingly unable to fulfill its defense=paradigm. They believe that the United States will continue as a global 
power, but expect it to be in a different=guise.25 Conversations with business, government, and military officials f=om 
burgeoning powers such as India, Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia produce =he same broad theme: Structural trends in 
economics, politics, and military affairs are undermining the de=ree of American predominance and the sustainability of 
the existing paradi=m of U.S. influence. A leading theme is a growing belief in the social and=economic decay of the U.S.
