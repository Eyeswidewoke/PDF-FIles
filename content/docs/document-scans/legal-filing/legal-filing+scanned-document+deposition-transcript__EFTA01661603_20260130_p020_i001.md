Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa... Page 20 of 32 
A girl who said she met Epstein when she was 15 said he told her if she told anybody what happened at 
his house, bad things could happen, the police reports state. 
Epstein's youngest alleged victim was 14 when she says she gave him a massage that included some 
sexual activity. She is now 16. The girl's father says he doesn't know whether she told Epstein her age. 
"My daughter has kept a lot of what happened from me because of sheer embarrassment," he said. "But 
she very much looked 14. Any prudent man would have had second thoughts about that." 
Defense attorney Jack Goldberger maintains that not only did Epstein pass a polygraph test showing he 
did not know the girls were minors, but their stories weren't credible. The state attorney's office also 
implied that their credibility was an issue when it decided not to charge Epstein directly, but instead give 
the case to the grand jury. 
"A prosecutor has to look at it in a much broader fashion," a state attorney's spokesman said last week. 
Epstein hired Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz when he became aware he was under 
investigation, and Dershowitz gave prosecutors information that some of the alleged victims had spoke 
of using alcohol and marijuana on a popular Web site, according to a Palm Beach police report. 
Prosecutors typically consider two things in deciding whether to charge somebody with sex-related 
offenses against minors — whether there is sufficient evidence and whether there is a public interest in 
doing so, Dekle said. 
If two teens are in a sexual relationship and the boy turns 18 before the girl, he could be charged with a 
sex crime if the sex continues. There would be no public interest in pursuing that, Dekle said. 
But where there is a large gap in ages — and especially in cases of teachers with students — there is a 
public interest in prosecuting, he said. Likewise if the accused has a track record of sex with minors. 
Still there is a "universal constant" in prosecuting these cases, Dekle said. Men who exploit underage 
children for sex often carefully choose their victims in ways that will minimize the risk to them, he said. 
Victims usually are from a lower social status, and they may suffer from psychological problems, Dekle 
said. 
"Lots of child sexual abuse victims have been victimized by multiple people over a period of time. Then 
the act of abuse produces behavior in the victims that further damages their credibility." Examples 
include promiscuous behavior and drug abuse. 
Some of the alleged victims in the Epstein case returned to his home multiple times for the massage 
sessions and the $200 to $300 he typically paid them per visit. "That would be a definite problem for the 
prosecutor," said Betty Resch, who prosecuted crimes against children in Palm Beach County for five 
years and now is in private practice in Lake Worth. 
"The victim becomes less sympathetic" to a jury, Resch said. "But she's a victim nevertheless. She's a 
kid." 
Most men charged with sex crimes against minors look normal, Dekle said. A jury expecting to see a 
monster seldom will. And the victims' ages work against them and in favor of the defendant in a trial,
