Special Event Redemption or Distribution of Corresponding Subordinated Debt Securities. If a Special 
Event relating to the preferred securities and common securities of the trust shall occur and be continuing, we 
have the right to redeem the corresponding subordinated debt securities, in whole but not in pan, and thereby 
cause a mandatory redemption of such preferred securities and common securities, in whole but not in part, at the 
redemption price within 90 days following the occurrence of the Special Event. At any time, we have the right to 
dissolve the related trust and after satisfaction of the liabilities of creditors of the trust as provided by applicable 
law, cause such corresponding subordinated debt securities to be distributed to the holders of such preferred 
securities and common securities in liquidation of the trust. if we do not elect to redeem the corresponding 
subordinated debt securities upon the occurrence of a Special Event, the applicable preferred securities will 
remain outstanding, and in the event a Tax Event has occurred and is continuing, Additional Sums may be 
payable on the corresponding subordinated debt securities. "Additional Sums" means the additional amounts as 
may be necessary in order that the amount of distributions then due and payable by the trust on the outstanding 
preferred securities and common securities of the trust shall not be reduced as a result of any additional taxes, 
duties and other governmental charges to which the trust has become subject as a result of a Tax Event. (Section 
1.1) 
On and from the date fixed for any distribution of corresponding subordinated debt securities upon 
dissolution of the trust: 
• 
the trust securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding: 
• 
the depositary or its nominee, as the record holder of the applicable preferred securities, will receive a 
registered global certificate or certificates representing the corresponding subordinated debt securities 
to be delivered upon such distribution: and 
• 
any certificates representing such preferred securities not held by the depositary or its nominee will be 
deemed to represent beneficial interests in the corresponding subordinated debt securities having an 
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of such preferred 
securities, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid 
distributions on such preferred securities until such certificates arc presented to the administrative 
trustees or their agent for transfer or rcissuance. (Section 4.2) 
We cannot predict the market prices for the preferred securities or the corresponding subordinated debt 
securities that may be distributed in exchange for preferred securities if a dissolution and liquidation of the trust 
were to occur. Accordingly, the preferred securities that you may purchase, or the corresponding subordinated 
debt securities that you may receive on dissolution and liquidation of the trust, may trade at a discount to the 
price that you paid to purchase the preferred securities. 
Redemption Procedures 
Preferred securities redeemed on each redemption date shall be redeemed at the redemption price with the 
applicable proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption of the corresponding subordinated debt securities. 
Redemptions of the preferred securities shall be made and the redemption price shall be payable on each 
redemption date only to the extent that the related trust has funds on hand available for the payment of such 
redemption price. See also "— Subordination of Common Securities." 
If the trust gives a notice of redemption, which notice will be irrevocable, in respect of its preferred 
securities, then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, to the extent funds arc available, 
the property trustee will deposit irrevocably with the depositary for the preferred securities funds sufficient to pay 
the applicable redemption price and will give the depositary irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the 
redemption price to the holders of such preferred securities. If such preferred securities are no longer in book-
entry form, the property trustee, to the extent funds are available, will irrevocably deposit with the paying agent 
for such preferred securities funds sufficient to pay the applicable redemption price and will give such paying 
agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the redemption price to the holders thereof upon surrender of 
their certificates evidencing such preferred securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions payable on or
