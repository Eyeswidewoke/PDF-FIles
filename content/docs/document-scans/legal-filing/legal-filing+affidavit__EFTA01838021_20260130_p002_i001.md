Technologies that transmit data under the noses of repressive authorities in this way are spreading like wildfire 
among pro-democracy groups, says Mr Moss. For example, after Egypt switched off its internet in January some 
activists brought laptops to places like Tahnr Square in Cairo to collect, via short-range wireless links, 
demonstrators' video recordings and other electronic messages. These activists then broadcast the material to 
the outside world using range-extending antennae. 
According to Bobby Soriano, an instructor at the Philippine branch of Tactical Tech, a British organization that 
teaches communication techniques to dissidents In five countries, such antennae can even foil government 
eavesdropping and jamming efforts. Directional antennae, unlike the omnidirectional sort, transmit on a narrow 
beam. This makes it hard for eavesdroppers to notice a signal is there. 
Citizens banned? 
Another way of confounding the authorities is to build portable FM radio stations. One broadcasting expert, who 
prefers not to be named but is currently based in Europe, is helping to develop a dozen such "backpack" radio 
stations for anti-government protesters in his native land in the Arabian peninsula. Though these stations have a 
range of only a few kilometres, that is enough for the leaders of a protest to use them to co-ordinate their 
followers. The stations' operators act as clearing houses for text messages, reading important ones over the air 
for everyone to hear. 
Conventional radio of this sort cannot, unfortunately, transmit video or web pages. But a group called Access, 
based in New York, is trying to overcome that. To help democracy movements In the Middle East and North 
Africa get online, It Is equipping a network of ham-radio operators with special modems that convert digital 
computer data into analogue radio signals that their equipment can cope with. These signals are then broadcast 
from operator to operator until they reach a network member in an area where the Internet functions. This 
operator reconverts the signal into computer-readable data and then e-mails or posts the Information online. 
Satellites provide yet another way of getting online, though they are expensive to connect to. It Is, however, 
beyond the authorities in most places to shut down a satellite operated by a foreign company or country. The 
best they can do is try to locate live satellite links using radiation-detection kit similar to that supposedly 
employed in Britain to seek out unlicensed televisions. The result is a game of cat and mouse between the 
authorities and satellite-using dissidents. Tactical Tech, for example, has trained dissidents in five countries to 
rig satellite dishes to computers in order to get online. It advises some users to log on only for short sessions, 
and to do so from a moving vehicle. 
Such dishes can also be repurposed for long-range intemet connections that do not involve satellites. Yahel Ben-
David, an electrical engineer at the University of California, Berkeley, who has designed secret cross-border links 
to the internet for people in several countries, does so by adding standard USB dongles designed for home Wi-Fi 
networks. Thus equipped, two properly aligned dishes as much as 100km apart can transmit enough data to 
carry high quality video. Moreover, the beam is so tightly focused that equipment a mere dozen metres away 
from its line would struggle to detect it. 
Creative ideas for circumventing cyber-attacks even extend to the redesign of apparently innocent domestic 
equipment. Kenneth Geers, an American naval-intelligence analyst at a NATO cyberwar unit in Tallinn, Estonia, 
describes a curious microwave oven. Though still able to cook food, its microwaves (essentially, short 
radiowaves) are modulated to encode information as though it were a normal radio transmitter. Thus, things 
turn full circle, for the original microwave oven was based on the magnetron from a military radar. From conflict 
to domesticity to conflict, then, in a mere six decades.
