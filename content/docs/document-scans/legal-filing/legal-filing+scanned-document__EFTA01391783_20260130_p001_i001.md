Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV. LP 
Certain Legal,ERISA and Tax Considerations 
The AIFM073
Valuation 
The Manager has decided that the nature of the investments that will be held by the Fund is such that there is no need 
for an external valuer. The Fund's valuations will be prepared in accordance with the UK AlFM Regulation on a fair value 
principle, based on U.S. GAAP and Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC*) 820 Fair Value Measurement. ASC 820 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes sources and valuation techniques. Accordingly, the Fund will be valued 
at an 'exit price' which is the value that would be received on selling the investment in an orderly transaction, between 
market participants at the measurement date. The Manager will establish a valuation committee (the 'Valuation 
Committee') to perform an assessment of valuations provided by the relevant investment specialists, together with 
acquisition information that has been gathered to understand each individual Investment. Deirdre Davies. the Manager's 
Chief Operating Officer, chairs the Valuation Committee and is also responsible for the Manager's valuation policy and 
procedures. Ms. Davies is not responsible for the Manager's deal activity or portfolio management, is functionally 
independent from the Managers portfolio management activities. and the Manager has put in place such measures as it 
considers reasonably necessary to mitigate conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with the valuation of the 
Fund's investments. Therefore, in the Manager's view, Ms. Davies has sufficient independence to oversee the valuation 
pokey and procedures in accordance with the Manager's compliance obligations. The Valuation Committee members, its 
terms of reference and the Managers valuation policy will be periodically assessed and internally audited to ensure 
compliance with the principles of the AIFMD. 
Fair treatment of Investors 
Please see Section 8: Conflicts of Interest for a summary of the policies established by the Manager in relation to 
conflicts of interest. In addition, as described more fully in Section 6: Summery of Terms and Conditions, the Manager 
has a clear and defined approach to side letter arrangements. Further, amendments to the Fund Partnership Agreement 
which would materially and adversely affect a Limited Partner in a way which discriminates against such Limited Partner 
vis-a-vis the other Limited Partners or increase the Commitment of a Limited Partner will require the consent of the 
affected Limited Partner. 
Liquidity management 
As the Fund is a 'closed-ended AIF' (as defined in the AIFMD) and the Investors will not have any redemption rights in 
respect of their Interests, there is no meaningful liquidity risk to manage.
Managers professional liability risk 
Glendower holds a professional indemnity insurance policy. This insurance policy covers the professional indemnity 
insurance requirements of the AIFMD in respect of Glendower acting as the Fund's AIFM. 
Governing law and legal implications of the contractual relationship
