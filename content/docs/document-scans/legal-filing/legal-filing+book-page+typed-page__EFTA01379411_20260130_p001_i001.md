EM Currency Handbook 2018: Still Fuel in the Tank 
Nigeria 
The Nigerian naira was introduced in 1973, replacing 
the pound at a fixed rate of 2 naira to the pound. 
Although the naira has gone through multiple regime 
changes over the years it is at present classified as a 
managed float. 
Nigeria suffers from the unique situation that the 
government is the main recipient, and therefore 
supplier, of foreign exchange in the economy, through 
oil-related 
taxes and 
revenues 
of 
the 
NNPC. 
Meanwhile, the bulk of the private sector has a 
continuous shortage of FX for imports and other 
foreign exchange payments. Only authorized dealers 
are allowed to buy and sell FX with the CBN. An 
interbank market for FX (IBEM) sets the market rate for 
the naira. 
In February 2015 the WDAS window was scrapped. All 
transactions are now channeled to the interbank 
market. The CBN sells USD directly at the interbank 
market at a fixed rate of currently NGN/USD 197. The 
CBN further introduced an order based two-way quote 
(OB2WQ) foreign exchange market. This means that 
authorized dealers are only allowed to buy USD if they 
have a matching order from a customer, i.e. an 
importer. In early July 2015 the CBN restricted the 
importers of 41 items from access to the interbank 
market. This pushed demand to the BDC segment of 
the market and resulted in a spread between the 
interbank rate and the BDC exchange rate (currently 
around 15%). The CBN sporadically provides USD to 
the BDC segment of the market via direct sales. 
Nigeria has been grappling with low oil prices and a 
security crisis in its oil rich delta region where militant 
strikes on pipelines has seen its production drop to 
near 30 year lows. In June 2016, the CBN announced it 
was moving to a free floating FX regime. USDNGN 
devalued some 60 pct going from the official rate of 
199 to 284 in the first week then stabilizing at 315-320 
levels in the months after. The free float did little to 
entice foreigners back into the market and with CBN 
being the only supplier of USD, liquidity worsened and 
the parallel rate widened to 460. In December 2016 
Nigeria announced it was delaying its Eurobond 
issuance till the end of the first quarter 2017 with hints 
of FX reform underway.
