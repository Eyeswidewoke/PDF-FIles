avoidance of doubt, the fees and expenses of consultants providing the foregoing and the 
cost of obtaining and storing data required for such systems and technology); accounting,

similar expenses related to the Multi-Strat Funds. A portion of research-related expenses 
may be paid for using "soft dollars" (i.e., commission dollars and transaction fees 
generated through agency and certain riskless principal transactions). 
To the extent any of the foregoing expenses are also attributable to any other investment 
fund, managed account, proprietary account or other account to which the General 
Partner, Hudson Bay Capital or any of their affiliates provides investment services 
(collectively, "Other Accounts"), such expenses will be allocated among the Multi-Strat 
Funds and the various Other Accounts in a manner as determined by Hudson Bay 
Capital in its sole discretion to be fair and reasonable, in accordance with Hudson Bay 
Capital's internal expense allocation policy. (See "Allocation of Expenses" below.) 
Expenses attributable to the Multi-Strat Funds will be shared on a pro rata basis among 
each investor account provided that (i) investor-specific expenses (including investor-
related taxes) may be borne by the investor to which they relate and (ii) investors of a PM 
Tranche will bear any and all costs and expenses exclusive to such PM Tranche, 
including the costs and expenses related to the establishment of such PM Tranche, as well 
as their pro rata share of any and all costs and expenses that are specific, but not 
exclusive, to such PM Tranche, such as investment-related expenses. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, certain expenses that only relate to particular investors may be paid by the 
Multi-Strat Funds generally (i.e., foreign tax reporting requirements) and may not be 
specifically allocated.
