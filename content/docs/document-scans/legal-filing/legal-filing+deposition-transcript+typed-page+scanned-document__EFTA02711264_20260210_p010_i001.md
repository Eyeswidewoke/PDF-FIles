Every movie is the first movie. ficeMechanisms for perceiving and responding to stimuli are at least partly generated by earlier 
stimulation.e aceThe information received by the brain both determines the manner of response and inhibits the establishment 
of new programs:1O irceThe ability to apprehend the external world with freshness of perception commonly decreases as the 
mind and the senses become conditioned by repeated experiences. Human beings thus perceive the world, and respond to it, 
not through the whole spectrum of their genetic potentialities but only through the areas of this spectrum not blocked by 
inhibitory mechanisms and made functional by environmental influences, especially the early ones.149 The information 
received by the brain from the movie experience at once serves to encode and rigidify operant programs. This encoding and 
rigidification as information must be considered in terms of the continuous operations of the brain. ficeThere is reason to 
believe that information is stored in the brain by alteration of the storage elements.a5° Once this change is effected, the 
information provided by the experience of new stimuli may be to activate the programs stored as alteration of the storage 
elements, giving form to extant operational patterns. 
Certain programs have been coded into the brainaTMs operation as species information. These patterns activate the 
orthosympathetic systems, pan of the autonomic or involuntary, muscular systems of the body. The orthosympathetic systems 
supply the energy for ateflight or fighta responses by pumping adrenalin through the system!' The hormonal changes 
necessary to perform the act are set in motion by the brain before the performance actually begins./2 Every movie is the first 
movie. The brain goes into its stereotyped movie program even before the ticket is purchased. The information received by 
the brain from the experience of purchasing a ticket may be enough to activate the hormonal responses of the movie 
experience. Buy your ticket: See the movie. 
We can talk about information-patterning for the brain only in the present. There is no other universe for the brain, only the 
all-at-once universe of simultaneous operations. Every action performed is ever present, programmed into the operant 
patterns of the brain as information. Thatirms all there is; there is no more. aceWhatATMs hereaTMs everywhere; whataTMs not 
hereaTMs nowhere.'" All that is real can be found in the operations of the brain. Time and space are considerations of the 
interpretation of the ordering, and not of the transaction. Causality and sequence are myths. There is no first time. Sequence 
is simultaneity. 
ficeMan created his world and was molded by his use of it.a£4 Nature was a man-made phenomenon. The invention-realization 
of the nonlinear extension of the brainaTMs experiencea"the socialization of minda"is on the same level as that of the invention 
of talking. Man did not realize he was talking until the day a man said, liceWermre talking' By understanding that the 
experience of the brain is continually communicated through the process of information, it can be seen that the extensions of 
man are to be viewed as communication, not as a means for the flow of communication. As such they provide the information 
for the continual process of neural coding. The interval is closed. No more individuals. No more man. Itirms a process. We 
construct a loop where output provides the information for input. On the species level the output (behavior) is environment. 
The input is the neural impulse. A change in environment (output) provides the brain with information it needs to maintain its 
continuity through adaptation, or a change in its operations (input). Man was the creator of acemind.fr Man determined his 
evolution. Man died. Dead and gone. 
Dangers exist because the frames of reference which enable the deciphering of the patterns of communication arc not easily 
understood. Man, living in a nonexistent illusory world of the past instant, could not readily discern the patterns of the activity 
of his brain. Change took place too rapidly. Man changed himself into non-existence. Man is dead. 
A word from the author: It is not the easiest activity to escape the human race and then effect the destruction of mankind. 
Perhaps the death of an abstraction is the most difficult death. The brain is conditioned by the activity of an abstract way of 
thinking, by the information it receives. These patterns do not die easily. Their destruction is the ultimate violence. What 
remains is the ghostly dreamworld of mann world, an abstraction, in which participation is no longer possible.
