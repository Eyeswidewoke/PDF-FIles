the mandatory withdrawal, which, by law, imposes exorbitant taxes that I also had to pay. You can work out the 
arithmetic for yourselves. And you will recall I'm sur= that when I requested that some of the taxes be covered by the 
marital trust (which, by rights, I should have full access to), Harry refused unles= I submitted to extensive and highly 
intrusive financial analysis, which of course I refused to do on principle. There was never a request for such financial 
analysis when distributions were made to family, or when Max distributed funds to family from the marital trust, or for 
any other gifts over the years. And I saw, and see, no reason why I shoul= be subjected to this humiliating demand. 
In addition, as I've repeatedly explained, I bought the apartment in th= Cambridge co-op on the erroneous assumption 
that the cost would be covered completely and quickly by the sale of the Lexington house. If I'd paid attention instead 
of just trusting advisers, I would have known, as they did, that I did not own the Lexington house and that the profits 
would go to you, so I was buying an expensive apartment in a co-op with no assets at all, a crazy decision. As I wrote, I 
agreed to the surreal idea of borro=ing money from within the family (with interest) only on the false assumption that 
the loan would be for a few weeks or months, hence meaningless. 
That's the "impoverishment," and I've now pretty much ove=come what had been done. 
All that keeps me from being "happy and relaxed" is your continue= insistence on pursuing these matters, which, again, I 
don't understand../b> 
You have even felt the need to hire multiple lawyers to threaten people who you had trusted for years, and who we 
believe have continued to do their utmost to act in your best interest and to help you navigate your new financial 
situation. 
Again, I'd be interested in knowing your source for these claims. You're quite right that for years I had (quite mistakenly) 
trusted peop=e who, it turned out, had been making decisions, such as those I have again reviewed, that were quite 
harmful to me. It is hard for me to compreh=nd how you think they would act in my best interest and help me navigate 
the financial difficulties that they had created in the light of what I have explained to you, repeatedly. And as I've 
written, that's only a pa=t of it. I mentioned the tens of thousands of dollars we paid Max for such things as a will so 
outlandish that we had to trash it at once (see my last letter). And there is quite a lot more. I don't und=rstand why you 
completely disregard the detailed and fully accurate information I have once again reviewed, and choose instead to rely 
on what you are told by others. And as I mentioned above, there has been serious wrongdoing, now coming to light, 
which you will find out about in due cours=. 
We have in fact found your letters over the past year increasingly alarming= If we felt that you were stable and content 
in your new life, we would probably accept the distance that has been created. But your statemen=s, in person, and in 
your letters, do not give us the impression that you feel stable and content. 
I have explained before, and will repeat again, that I am very stable and content in my new life, and looking forward to 
the peace, tranquillity, work and life conditions that I think I have a right to enjoy after many years of hard work and 
with ample attention to caring for the needs of my children. There was a financial problem caused by extremely 
harmfu= decisions of advisers that I had trusted, but that's now pretty much ov=rcome. What's causing extreme distress 
is your insistence, which I don't u=derstand, on pursuing the matters we are now again discussing. 
One matter that remains is that marital trust. I explained what has been happening in a letter that you seem again to 
have ignored, and won'=t repeat the full details. In brief, Max has concocted an interpretatio= that is technically legal 
but that clearly makes no sense at all. It is based on the outlandish idea that Mommoy and I had decided to split our 
assets so that she would make decisions about allocation of her part and I would make decisions about allocation of my 
part. The idea is insane, and never occurred to either of us. Max's weird interp=etation is based on a pure technicality: 
namely, in setting up the trust in M's name for tax purposes, the funds were first assigned to her revocable Trust and 
then to the Marital Trust. That Trust was, of course, intended for the use of the survivor -- which is, for example, why I 
have always selected the Trustees without question or discussion, and should continue to do so, just as M would have 
done had she been the survivor, as we antici=ated.
