EM Currency Handbook 2018: Still Fuel in the Tank 
Mexico 
After the MXN's large devaluation in the midst of the 
1994 crisis, Mexican authorities switched from the 
currency's regime from a managed exchange rate to a 
free float. To retain some control over the Peso, 
representatives of Banxico and the Finance Ministry 
who comprise the Exchange Commission (EC) set 
several rule-based intervention schemes aimed at 
managing reserve accumulation and abating volatility. 
USD/MXN options-based interventions began in August 
of 1996. In February of 1997, spot purchases were 
added as an intervention tool to inject USD liquidity 
during periods of market stress so as to combat 
volatility. Both of these intervention programs were 
canceled on June of 2001 after being employed a 
combined total of 14 times. The interventions occurred 
mainly between August of 1998 and January of 1999 
and the total amount of USD injected into the FX 
market was USD 1.95bn. 
Starting on May of 2003. the EC set USD auction 
mechanism to manage the accumulation of reserves as 
higher and more volatile oil prices had become a threat 
to the MXN. Despite the auctions, reserves grew very 
quickly to a record high level of USD 87bn.The auctions 
were indefinitely suspended on July 21st 2008 after the 
USD/MXN fell to 9.85 during the first half of the year. 
Yet after struggling to control the Peso's appreciation 
the tables turned and the currency experienced strong 
appreciation pressures in the midst of the 2008 crisis. 
The Mexican corporate sector suffered FX-related 
losses because of its exposure to derivatives risk 
pushing the demand for USD hedges even higher. The 
EC reacted by setting a rule-based intervention scheme 
via USD auctions similar to the one used in the 1990s. 
On days in which the USD/MXN increased by more 
than 2% relative to the previous closing, USD 400m 
would be offered. The rule was supplemented with an 
extra auction of USD 100m to be held every day (until 
October of 2009) regardless of price action and extra 
discretionary auctions on particularly volatile days. 
During 2015, 10% of reserves were spent on 
interventions and the MXN remained weak. On 
November of 2015, the EC added conditions to its 
rules-based interventions: USD 200 mm would be sold 
on days of an MXN depreciation of at least 1% with an 
extra USD 200 mm offered if the depreciation was 
greater than 1.5%. Finally, on February 2016 the EC 
suspended all rules-based interventions when both the 
Ministry of Finance and Banxico announced a series of 
fiscal and monetary policy actions to improve Mexico's 
macroeconomic environment and more specifically its 
fiscal accounts. Banxico raised its policy rate by 50bps 
and since then it seems to have responded to brusque

MXN sell-offs with rate hikes despite the stability of 
inflation expectations, the negative output gap, and the 
little evidence of a relevant exchange rate pass-through. 
On February 2017 Mexico's Exchange Commission 
announced it would intervene the FX market by 
auctioning off domestic NDFs settled in MXN up to a 
notional amount of USD 20bn. As of December of 2017 
only USD 5bn worth of the instrument had been issued.
