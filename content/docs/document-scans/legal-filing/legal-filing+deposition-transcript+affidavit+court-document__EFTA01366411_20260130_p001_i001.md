agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to file a new registration statement under the Securities 
Act, following the completion of the Company's initial Business Combination. Each Warrant entitles the holder to 
purchase one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $5.75. No fractional shares will be issued upon 
exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional 
interest in a share, the Company will, upon exercise. round down to the nearest whole number the number of 
shares of common stock to be issued to the warrant holder. Each Warrant will become exercisable on the later of 
30 days after the completion of the Company's initial Business Combination or 12 months from the closing of the 
Proposed Offering and will expire five years after the completion of the Company's initial Business Combination 
or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. However. if the Company does not complete its initial Business 
Combination on or prior to the 24-month period allotted to complete the Business Combination, the Warrants will 
expire at the end of such period. If the Company is unable to deliver registered shares of common stock to the 
holder upon exercise of Warrants issued in connection with the 13,500.000 public units during the exercise period, 
there will be no net cash settlement of these Warrants and the Warrants will expire worthless, unless they may be 
exercised on a cashless basis in the circumstances described in the warrant agreement. Once the warrants become 
exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per 
warrant upon a minimum of 30 days' prior written notice of redemption, only in the event that the last sale price 
of the Company's shares of common stock equals or exceeds $24.00 per sham for any 20 trading days within the 
30-trading day period ending on the third trading day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the 
warrant holders. 
The Company expects to grant the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,025,000 additional Units 
to cover any over-allotment, at the initial public offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. 
The warrants that would be issued in connection with 2,025,000 over-allotment units are identical to the public 
warrants and have no net cash settlement provisions.
