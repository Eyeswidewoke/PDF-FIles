Government Regulation 
Fanning Regulation 
The farms that we own and intend to acquire are subject to the laws, ordinances and regulations of 
state, local and federal governments, including laws, ordinances and regulations involving land use and 
usage, water rights, treatment methods, disturbance, the environment and eminent domain. 
Farmland is principally subject to environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. Each 
governmental jurisdiction has its own distinct environmental laws, ordinances and regulations governing 
the use of farmland. These laws, ordinances and regulations primarily seek to regulate water usage and 
water runoff due to the limited supply in certain areas, including California, Florida and Illinois, where 
the majority of the farms in our portfolio are located. In addition, runoff from rain or from irrigation is 
also governed by state, county and federal governments. Further, if any of the water used on or running 
off of our farms flows to any rivers, ponds, the ocean or other water sources, then there may be 
specific laws, ordinances and/or regulations governing the amount of pollutants, including sediments, 
nutrients and pesticides, that such water may contain. 
All of the farms in our portfolio have sources of water, including wells and/or surface water that 
currently provide sufficient amounts of water necessary for the current farming operations at each 
location. Ilowever, should the need arise for additional water from wells and/or surface water sources, 
we may be required to obtain additional permits or approvals or to make other required notices prior 
to developing or using such water sources. Permits for drilling water wells or withdrawing surface water 
may be required by federal, state and local governmental entities pursuant to laws, ordinances, 
regulations or other requirements, and such permits may be difficult to obtain due to drought, the 
limited supply of available water within the farming districts of the states in which our farms are 
located or other reasons. We believe that our farms are currently in compliance with applicable state, 
county and federal environmental and agricultural regulations. 
In addition to the regulation of water usage and water runoff, state, county and federal 
governments also seek to regulate the type, quantity and method of use of chemicals for growing crops, 
including fertilizers, pesticides and nutrient rich materials. Such regulations could include restricting or 
preventing the use of such chemicals and materials near residential housing or near water sources. For 
example, when farmland is located near residential housing, the spraying of crops on the farmland may 
only occur on windless days and the spray may not be used on plants that are specific distances from 
homes. Further, some regulations have strictly forbidden or significantly limit the use of certain 
chemicals and materials. Licenses, permits and approvals must be obtained from governmental 
authorities before most chemicals and materials can be used on farmland and crops, and reports on the 
usage of such chemicals and materials must be submitted in accordance with the terms of the specific 
licenses, permits and approvals. Failure to obtain such permits or comply with the terms of such 
permits could result in fines and imprisonment. 
The use of farmland in California, Florida and other jurisdictions is also subject to regulations 
governing the protection of endangered species. When farmland borders, or is in close proximity to, 
national parks, protected natural habitats or wetlands, the farming operations on such faros must 
comply with the laws, ordinances and regulations related to the use of chemicals in a manner to avoid 
disturbing the habitats, wetlands or other protected areas. 
In addition to environmental regulations, state, county and federal governments also have various 
regulations governing labor practices used in connection with farming operations. For example, these
