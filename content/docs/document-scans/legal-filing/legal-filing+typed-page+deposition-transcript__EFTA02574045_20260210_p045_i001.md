Development experts, so f=cused on their endless and crucial work, often neglect this area. Yet find=ng ways to leverage 
yours or your colleagues' public visibility is not as difficult as it sounds. Media training can be expensive, but eno=mously 
beneficial. Persistence pays off. And above all, helping people to =hink like "thought leaders" can bring real results. 
Our fellows represents a =rocs-section of the work under way in Africa today, from a Congolese docto= seeking to build 
a health system in one of the remotest parts of his country to a Ghanaian tech entrepreneur devising new strategi=s for 
expanding math and science education in rural communities. Each one =s an expert, and each one has a story to tell. 
Helping them to craft their=stories, and find an audience, have been our challenges. 
The audience, at least in=tially, has been the easy part. The explosion of online and issue-driven m=dia over the past 
decade has created a wide range of outlets, many of which are eager to bring new voices to light. Development-focused 
=edia such as the Guardian's Global Development section, general interest a=gregators such as the Huffington Post, and 
geographic specialists such as =IlAfrica.com and Think Africa Press all represent potential platforms for fresh writing 
about development issu=s. Even mainstream outlets such as CNN and Al Jazeera are welcoming new co=tributors for 
their opinion sections, while professional community portals=such as Business Fights Poverty and the Guardian Global 
Development Professionals Network can open the doo= to engaged specialists who care deeply about the challenges 
ahead.=/p> 
Add to this the increasin=ly crowded schedule of conferences and meetings ranging from the Clinton Grobal Initiative 
and Skoll World Forum to TEDx events held around the world and it's clear that there are a wealth of opportunities t= 
reach important audiences with new stories. 
Crafting those stories ha= proved a little trickier. While the development-focused media has expande=, the standard for 
what makes a compelling blog, speech or opinion piece have not: clear writing and cogent argument backed up by sol=d 
evidence and examples. Putting the pieces together, and injecting the ri=ht personal note to make for a truly memorable 
piece, takes work, self-con=idence and practice. 
For our first New Voices =ellowship meeting in Johannesburg in June, we set up a series of training =essions on how to 
handle media interviews, how to behave on camera, and how to build an online presence. But the most important par= 
of the curriculum turned out to be a crash course in confidence: how to b=lieve in the importance of what you have to 
say. For many of our fellows, =nused to thinking of themselves as "thought leaders", the leadership component was new 
territory= We learned that helping the fellows define their specific areas of expert=se, and to understand how that 
personal expertise can translate into impor=ant contributions to the global development discussion, was an essential 
starting point. One fellow, an expert on mate=nal health from Tanzania, found new confidence in the fact that alongside 
=er medical degrees she has personal experience as an African mother. Anoth=r, who specialises in poverty alleviation in 
Nairobi's slums, began to harness his own stories about growing up in t=ose slums to buttress his points about 
development in informal settlements=
