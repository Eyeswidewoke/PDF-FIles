enforcement officials insist that after more than a year of preparations, they are ready to play host. "We're going 
above and beyond what we've seen in the past when we've hosted previously," Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. "We 
know we're safer than we've ever been before." Super Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond 
the stadium, said Homeland Security Investigations New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Eric DeLaune, who is 
leading federal coordination of security. Federal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in rooftop 
snipers and will position armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium, the French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune 
said. 
Continued Reporting: Trump's Pick to Lead the National Counterterrorism Center Has Called Jan. 6 Rioters 
'Political Prisoners' 
NBC News (02/05, Luce) reported that President Donald Trump's pick to oversee U.S. intelligence on terrorism 
threats is a retired Green Beret who has called Jan. 6 rioters "political prisoners" and has had ties to a man police 
say was a member of the far-right group known as the "Proud Boys." According to the article, the selection of Joe 
Kent as director of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is part of a wider effort by the administration to 
place trusted loyalists and partisan activists in senior government positions in intelligence, law enforcement and 
diplomacy. Trump and his supporters have said the intelligence community sought to undermine the president in 
the past and needs a radical overhaul. The National Counterterrorism Center oversees U.S. government intelligence 
on terrorist threats and retains a database of all known and suspected terrorists. Kent served in Army Special 
Forces, undertaking 11 combat deployments during a 20-year career, and later worked at the CIA. He lost his wife, a 
Navy cryptologist, in a terrorist bombing in Syria in 2019. The article mentioned that Kent ran unsuccessfully for 
Congress twice in Washington state, in 2022 and 2024. Campaign finance documents show that Kent in 2022 made 
payments for "campaign consulting" to Graham Jorgensen, who was identified as a Proud Boy in a 2018 law 
enforcement report. The Proud Boys are viewed as "an extremist group with ties to white nationalism" by the FBI, 
and authorities say they played a significant role in the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol. The group has denied any 
connection to racist elements and says it is a fraternal group opposed to political correctness. In a post on Truth 
Social, Trump praised Kent. "As a Soldier, Green Beret, and CIA Officer, Joe has hunted down terrorists and criminals 
his entire adult life," Trump wrote. "Above all, Joe knows the terrible cost of terrorism, losing his wonderful wife, 
Shannon, a Great American Hero, who was killed in the fight against ISIS." The Guardian (02/05, Wilson) also 
reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: U.S. Court Convicts Founder of Neo-Nazi Group for Plot to Destroy Baltimore Power 
Grid 
The Jerusalem Post (02/05, Starr) reported that a U.S. court has convicted the founder of a neo-Nazi group who 
planned to destroy the Baltimore power grid in an attempt to accelerate racial violence, the Dal said Tuesday. 
Brandon Russell, 29, the founder of Atomwaffen Division (AWD) and a resident of Orlando, could receive a 20-year 
prison sentence for conspiracy to damage an energy facility, it said. He had recruited Maryland resident Sarah Beth 
Clendaniel, and from 2022-2023, they planned to damage electrical infrastructure that could have caused more 
than $75 million in damages, it added. 
Continued Reporting: Donald Trump Reveals Dead-Man's Switch in Case of Iran Assassination 
Newsweek (02/05, Orton) reported that President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he has left orders for Iran to 
face total destruction if it attempts to assassinate him, as federal authorities continue to track threats from 
Tehran. "If they did that, they would be obliterated," Trump told reporters while signing an executive order aimed 
at intensifying U.S. sanctions on Iran. "I've left instructions—if they do it, they get obliterated. There won't be 
anything left." According to the article, Trump's remarks come amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and 
Iran, as federal officials continue to monitor threats against him and former members of his first administration. 
Iranian officials have long vowed retaliation for Trump's 2020 decision to authorize a drone strike that killed 
Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. In recent years, U.S. 
intelligence agencies have reported multiple Iranian plots targeting Trump and other former top officials. Trump 
was wounded in a July assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. U.S. officials later confirmed that 
intelligence agencies had been tracking threats from Iran ahead of the event, though they stated at the time that 
there was no evidence Iran was involved in the shooting. Trump issued the warning to Iran during the signing of an 
executive order reinstating the "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran. This strategy aims to halt Iran's nuclear 
ambitions by reducing its oil exports to zero. The order directs the U.S. Treasury and State Department to
