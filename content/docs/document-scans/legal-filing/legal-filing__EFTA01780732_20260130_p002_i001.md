> As an auditor, investor or a trading partner, you might want to drill =own and try to test the assumptions that the 
company is making or test =hat might happen if some of the assumptions that the company were =aking changed. You 
might also want to understand how buying the company =ould change your own company based on the way your 
obligations and bets =nteracted with theirs. Today you would rack up millions of dollars in =uditor fees to "get to the 
bottom" of most big =ompanies. The process would involved manually reviewing the contracts =nd the assumptions 
made in every cell of every spreadsheet. That'= because accounting is a very "lossy" process reducing =omplex functions 
with probabilities and dependencies into static =umbers at every step. The underlying information is stored somewhere, 
=ut most of it requires manually digging around. 
> The modern financial system is full of companies who have figured out =ays to guess when investors and the 
companies themselves have made =istakes in their assumptions. These companies bet against the companies =nd 
financial assets with inaccurate pricing or are somehow able to take =dvantage of the gap in information and convert 
this into financial =eturns. Also, when these mistakes are duplicated across the system it =ause fluctuation amplification 
which also allows companies to make more =oney both as markets rise as well as fall if they can guess in advance =f 
those fluctuations. In fact, as long as the whole system doesn'= collapse, smart traders make more money on fluctuation 
than on =tability. 
> Just like rodent exterminators aren't excited about the idea =f rodents being completely eliminated - they would not 
longer have jobs = those financial institutions that make money by "making the =ystem more efficient and eliminating 
waste" don't =eally want a system that isn't wasteful and is very stable. 
> Right now, the financial system is built on top of a way of thinking =bout money and value that was designed back 
when all we had was pen and =aper and where reducing the complexity of all of the web of =ependencies and 
obligations was the only way to make the system =unctionally efficient. The way to reduce to complexity was to add it 
up =nd simplify it. The current technology just builds on these 700 year =ld building blocks trying to make the system 
"better" =y doing very sophisticated analysis of the patterns and information =ithout addressing the underlying problem 
of a lossy and over-simplified =iew of the world. This view of the world being that everything of =E2 value" should be as 
quickly as possible reduced to some =E2 value" where "value" is a number =enominated in "money." 
> Today, we have the technology and the computational power to create a =ystem of accounts that isn't as lossy and in 
fact could retain =nd deal with a lot of the complexity that the current system of =ccounts was meant to avoid. 
> There is no reason that every entry in our books needs to be a number. =he cells could be an algorithmic 
representations of the obligations and =ependencies that it represents. In fact, using machine learning, =ccounts could 
become sophisticated probabilistic models on what might =appen depending on how things around it changed with the 
"value =80 of any system being different depending on who was asking, where =hat person was, and in what time 
frame. 
> Today, when the Financial Stability Board conducts a stress test, it =ives a bank a scenario - changes in the credit 
markets or the prices of =ertain things. The bank is then required to return a report on whether =t would crash or 
remain solvent. This requires lots of human labor and =ork to go through the accounts and run simulations. What if the 
=ccounts were all algorithmic and you could instantly provide the answer =o the question. What if you had a learning 
model that could answer a =ore important question - "What sets of changes to the market =OULD make you crash and 
why?" That's really what we =ant to know. We want to know this not just for one bank, but the whole =ystem of banks, 
investors, and everything that is interacting =inancially. 
> When I'm buying something from a company - lets say a credit =efault swap from your company, AIG. What I want to 
know is whether, =hen the day came to pay the obligation on the impossibly unlikely =hance that the AA mortgage 
backed bonds that I was betting against =efaulted, you'd be able to pay. Right now, there is no easy way =o do this. 
However, what if all of the obligations and contracts, =nstead of being written on paper and recorded as numbers, were 
actually =omputable and "visible." You'd immediately be =ble to see that, in fact, in the scenario in which you'd have =o
