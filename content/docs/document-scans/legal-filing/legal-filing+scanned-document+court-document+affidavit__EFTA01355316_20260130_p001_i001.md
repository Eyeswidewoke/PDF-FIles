Bottom-up Diligence (Hedge Funds): 
The Hedge Fund Private Access Fund selection process encompasses five stages. 
In the first stage, iCapital investigates market opportunity and platform needs. iCapital seeks to 
identify strategies which are best suited for the current market environment In particular. 
iCapital endeavors to add managers that are able to take advantage of a unique opportunity 
that a market dislocation might present. From a platform needs perspective. iCapital seeks to 
maintain an offering of 2 to 3 managers within each of the key hedge fund strategy buckets. 
across a diverse mix of fund manager profiles. As part of this process. iCapital is continually 
examining the peers of existing funds to better understand the markets and strategies. 
At the second stage of the diligence process iCapital aims to identify managers to evaluate 
more closely. iCapital builds a peer group universe, leveraging iCapital's entire sourcing 
capability, to identify managers with strong performance track records, including looking at 
return, volatility and drawdowns. 
The third stage of the diligence process is designed for iCapital to conduct initial diligence on 
select managers. As part of the initial due diligence iCapital will hold a meeting or conference 
call, followed by in-person meetings at the manager's or iCapital's offices. In these meetings. 
iCapital seeks to understand the quality and stability of the investment team, the strength of 
the organization, the past drivers of the track record and the stability of the performance going 
forward. 
In the fourth stage. iCapital proceeds with a diligence deep dive. iCapital makes all investment 
and fund selection decisions but has engaged Castle Hall Alternatives Inc. ("Castle Hall") to 
assist in hedge fund due diligence. Castle Hall performs an independent evaluation of the 
manager from an investment and operational due diligence perspective. Castle Hall's diligence 
process usually takes four to six weeks to complete. 
In the last stage. if iCapital is comfortable with Castle Hall's due diligence findings, the manager 
will be presented to the iCapital Investment Committee. The due diligence report is presented 
to iCapital's Investment Committee for approval and a unanimous vote of the Investment 
Committee is required for any investment opportunity to be marketed to our network. 
With respect to all of its diligence activities, while iCapital intends to conduct both investment 
and limited operational due diligence with respect to the Underlying Funds as part of the
