g. The director of the office Erin Ellison was uncooperative and hostile during many 
interactions with my counsel, my staff, and me, often imposing unrealistic 
deadlines only to agree to delay when confronted by my legal counsel. Moreover 
she seemed to never have met an allegation she didn't like. Trivial and absurd 
claims, involving a range of things from childish drawings, to jokes, to simple and 
accurate statements of fact were treated as violations and explored with the same 
intensity as more substantial items that should have been explored properly. I was 
lied to on numerous occasions. Ms. Ellison specifically indicated that her office did 
not go on a 'fishing' expedition, and did not reach out to seek complainants who 
did not contact her office, but the evidence shows that she contacted BuzzFeed to 
ask for contact information for just such individuals. I later discovered that she 
also presented me with partial information about various complaints, presumably 
with a hope to somehow trip me up. Her biases were clear. Guilt was presumed, 
not innocence. Unsubstantiated allegations from individuals were accepted as fact, 
even if those individuals had otherwise provided false information. Exculpatory 
information by others was discounted. Ms. Ellison ultimately started referring to 
the complainant from Australia with inappropriate familiarity, while I was always 
formally addressed as Dr. Krauss. Ms. Ellison inappropriate confronted me one of 
my staff with the allegation that we were having an affair, which we were not, in 
the process manufacturing allegations that were not brought forward by anyone 
else. 
h. I was held accountable for things about which I had no knowledge. And in this 
regard a double standard was applied ability. I was held accountable for not 
reporting apparent harassment of a staff member about which I was unaware. 
However one of the claims against me involved a staff member who claimed she 
had been told I had violated University policy, but she was not held accountable for 
not reporting this to the University until she was interviewed by OEI, eight years 
after the fact. 
(As it turned, her claim was false.) 
i. There was no adherence to the common principles of presumption of innocence in 
the absence of evidence, unbiased examination of evidence, and the opportunity to 
cross-examine complainants. 
The fact that I was not able to respond to claims and evidence, which were only provided 
to me after the OEI had reached their determination, and the fact that I could not appeal 
the process or conclusions or confront my accusers, is reminiscent of Stalin's Soviet Union. 
These are severe violations of due process. 
I urge you to launch an independent 
investigation into Ms. Ellison, and the running of her office. The University use of a single 
investigator model for Title IX violations has led to abuses that need to be addressed, for 
the sake of everyone at the University. As you are aware, both case law, and Department 
of Education standards for such investigations are changing. It is important that ASU 
attempt to provide equal protections for accused as well as accusers.
