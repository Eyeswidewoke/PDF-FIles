376 III. App. 3d 599, *; 876 N.E.2d 129, **; 
2007 III. App. LEXIS 962, ***; 315 III. Dec. 129 
"Each of the guarantors of the lease, being Harvey Swento and Cherry L. Swento (the 'Original Guarantors'). has 
executed this Agreement to acknowledge and agree to the terms set forth herein and the guaranty obligations imposed 
upon each of them hereby. and to ratify, reaffirm and confirm their joint and several obligations under and pursuant to 
that certain Personal Guaranty of Lease dated as of July 8. 1991. in favor of the Landlord." 
Subsequently, Jeepers Illinois again failed to meet its rent payment obligations and on 
November 8, 2000, CEC filed a forcible eviction and detainer action. On December 15, 
2000, CEC obtained an agreed order of possession for the premises against Jeepers 
Illinois. The order terminated Jeepers Illinois' right of possession of the premises under the 
lease and granted a money judgment to CEC for amounts due and owing under the lease. 
The order also provided that CEC would cancel the eviction proceedings with respect to 
the premises if Jeepers Illinois complied with certain conditions contained in the 
possession order, including, without limitation, [nil] paying those sums due and owing to 
CEC as rent under the lease for the month of January 2001, by January 15, 2001. 
Jeepers Illinois failed to pay the rental amounts due CEC by January 15, 2001. On 
January 26, 2001, CEC and Jeepers Illinois entered into an "Agreement to Reinstate Right 
of Possession" (the Agreement). Pursuant to the Agreement, CEC agreed to extend the 
deadline for Jeepers Illinois to pay the overdue rent under the lease and permitted Jeepers 
Illinois to maintain possession of the leased premises so long as it met the extended 
deadline. The Agreement provided that Jeepers Illinois would receive an extension of time 
for the payment of the January rent until January 26, 2001, and an extension of time for 
the payment of the February 2001 rent until February 9, 2001. The Agreement stated: 
"Landlord is not willing to grant Tenant's requests unless Tenant enters into this Agreement (and timely and fully 
satisfies and performs each of Tenant's covenants and obligations herein), and uNess Tenant causes all of the 
Guarantors to ratify and confirm this Agreement." 
The Agreement also provided the following: (1) a modification of section 19.01 of the 
lease, dealing with notice requirements; r""10] (2) an addition [" 605] of section 19.23 to 
the lease, which required the tenant to ("135] execute an estoppel certificate upon 
request to acknowledge the parties' respective rights under the lease; (3) an addition of 
section 19.24 to the lease, which required the delivery of current financial statements to 
the landlord; (4) an addition of section 19.25 to the lease, which waived the parties' rights 
to a jury trial and objections to venue in the event of litigation arising out of the lease; and 
(5) an addition of a covenant by the tenant that the lease is valid, in full force and effect, 
and that the tenant does not have any defense, claim or offset right against the landlord as 
of the date the Agreement was executed. The Agreement was not signed by the Swentos. 
Following the Agreement, Jeepers Illinois again became delinquent in its rent payment 
obligations under the lease. After the lease expired in June 2002 and Jeepers Illinois 
vacated the leased space at the shopping center, Jeepers Illinois failed to return the 
leased space in the condition required by the lease. On September 20, 2002, CEC filed a 
complaint seeking to recover payment for unpaid rent and repair to the leased premises. 
The complaint [""1 1] named Jeepers Illinois as the tenant, and Jeepers and the Swentos 
as guarantors under the lease. 
On June 28, 2006, after counsel for Jeepers Illinois and Jeepers had withdrawn its 
representation of those entities, the circuit court granted CEC's motion for summary 
judgment against Jeepers Illinois and Jeepers for unpaid rent obligations. The court also
