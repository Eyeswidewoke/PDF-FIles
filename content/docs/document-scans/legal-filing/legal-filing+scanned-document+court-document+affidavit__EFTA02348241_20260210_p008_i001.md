American strategic thought. Most Americans have thought as litt=e as possible about nuclear weapons since the end of 
the Cold War. This un=ven but powerful book by Paul Bracken shows why that is a mistake. 
like a rumpled professor in an undergraduate seminar, Mr. Bracken takes a l=ng time to get to the heart of his subject. 
There is a lot of throat clear=ng, anecdote telling and general attempts to put his audience at ease. Rea=ers will be 
tempted to abandon the book early on, but this would be a mist=ke. As the "The Second Nuclear Age" unfolds, the 
author makes a convincing=argument that nuclear strategy is likely to play a major role in geopoliti=s. 
Since their use invites devastating retaliation, many strategists today ima=ine that nuclear weapons can never be used 
to good effect and are therefor= essentially worthless. This perception doesn't just shape American though=s about our 
own arsenal; it impels American leaders to underestimate the d=fficulties of nonproliferation because they don't fully 
grasp the size of =he gains that nonnuclear powers can achieve in joining the Bomb Club. Our =trategists, says Mr. 
Bracken, are in a state of denial: "An older generati=n wants to make the nuclear nightmare go away by inoculating the 
young wit= protective ideas. Nuclear weapons are useless and we should get rid of th=m. Strengthen the [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty]. Get rid of ballistic =issiles. Deterrence will work." 
These ideas, very much at the heart of the present administration's strateg=c thought, are fantasies, Mr. Bracken 
believes. His central contention is =hat we are in a second nuclear age. While there were several nuclear power= in the 
previous one, the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet=Union overshadowed the others. The dynamics then 
were largely bipolar. We =ive in a multipolar nuclear world. And there are nine nuclear powers today= the U.S., Britain, 
France, Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and Nor=h Korea. More will likely emerge. 
The author presents detailed case studies on East Asia, South Asia and the =iddle East to bolster his argument that the 
multipolar nuclear world is al=eady changing the military strategies of regional powers in significant wa=s and to show 
that American national strategy—still focused on nonprolif=ration and lacking an understanding of the new nuclear 
dynamics—is laggi=g behind. 
His analysis of the role of nuclear weapons in the India-Pakistan rivalry i= disturbing and illuminating. The two sides 
haven't used their weapons, bu= their arsenals have changed their military and political strategies in wa=s that make the 
region more explosive and crisis prone. Pakistan, unable t= compete in conventional weapons with its larger and 
wealthier neighbor, i= expanding the quantity, upgrading the quality and diversifying the design= of its arsenal. India, 
meanwhile, is investing heavily in capabilities th=t would allow it to spot Pakistani preparations for a nuclear strike, 
poss=bly to pre-empt with force. 
Mr. Bracken says that nuclear and conventional strategy are closely tied fo= both countries. India is organizing its 
nonnuclear forces in ways intende= to anticipate and offset Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. It is also investing=in detection 
and surveillance technologies aimed at both monitoring the st=te of Islamabad's nuclear preparedness and revealing its 
conventional vuln=rabilities. These Indian capabilities have in turn changed Pakistan's nucl=ar and conventional plans. 
Both sides thus derive important advantages fro= their nuclear arsenals. (For India, these advantages are supra-regional, 
=s New Delhi looks nervously to a rising Beijing next-door.) Neither will erer give up nukes. 
The author's own sense of the dynamics of a multipolar nuclear world is som=times less than complete. He tries, for 
example, to analyze the impact of = nuclear Iran on the Middle East by confining his analysis to Israel, the =nited States 
and Iran. Missing are the inevitable and serious effects as S=udi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and other regional powers 
respond to the new sit=ation. 
Even so, Mr. Bracken's view is a powerful one. It holds little comfort for =heorists of international relations, whatever 
their orientation. Liberals =ill be appalled by his picture of a future in which widespread nuclear wea=ons impede the 
growth of the law-based order they seek. Nuclear weapons em=ody traditional ideas of state sovereignty; a world in 
which they drive st=ategic decisions and political arrangements is one that won't be guided by=international law and 
organized by liberal institutions. If you have a nuc=ear weapon, the United Nations and the International Criminal Court 
can't =ake you do anything you really don't want to do. 
But realists will also find much to annoy them in Mr. Bracken's book. As th= author shows, the view common among 
many "realist" strategic thinkers—u=iversal proliferation means universal peace—is formulaic and undermined =y the 
fact that nuclear weapons have real uses that commend them to states= The problems of the second nuclear age aren't 
ones we will solve quickly. M=. Bracken sees decades of multilateral nuclear rivalry as more states gain=bombs and as 
the strategic consequences of nuclear arsenals in more hands =ome to be better understood. This isn't a cheery book, 
but it is a valuabl= one. The questions Mr. Bracken raises about the sustainability of current=American foreign policy 
thinking are particularly timely. Nuclear strategy=must come out of its post-Cold War retirement. We are once again in a 
worl= where nuclear weapons count.
