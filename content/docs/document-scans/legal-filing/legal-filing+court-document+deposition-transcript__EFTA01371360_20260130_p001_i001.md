2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
Of the 186,031 N14 Class p27] members, 5,310 submitted claims, 123 opted out, and 23 
submitted objections.' ECF No. 107-1¶¶ 13-18. The percentage of Class members who 
submitted a claim is small, a factor that this Court has previously held may "cancel[ ] out" a 
low objection rate. Martina, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145285, 2013 WL 5567157, at *5-6. As 
Plaintiffs point out, however, the low response rate in this case is perhaps expected: 
according to Defendants, the defect rate in Class Vehicles is "in the single digits," so the 
vast majority of Class members did not suffer harm and may have no reason to seek repair 
or replacement of their timing chains or timing chain tensioners. Id. at 21 n.9. 
1 Plaintiffs reference 20 total objections, excluding the objections of Richard Ellenbogen. ECF No. 78. Timothy Fitzgerald. ECF 
No. 92-5 Ex. 11, and Donald Mann, ECF No. 104. for lack of standing because the three opted out of the N14 Class; the 
objection of Shirtey M. Stipe-Zendle. ECF No. 102. because objection is actually an erroneously filed claim; and the objection of 
Marika Hamilton, ECF No. 107-2 Ex. 11 for unknown reasons; and including objections from Gerald Maloney and Sarah H. 
Beeby that have not been filed on ECF or otherwise provided to the Court. ECF No. 107-1 Ex. B. The Court considers the [•28] 
23 objections that have been filed with or otherwise provided to the Court. 
Twenty-three Class members, or approximately 0.01 percent of Class, objected to the 
settlement. Most of the objectors argue either that (a) the settlement's warranty extension 
is inadequate because it does not cover their vehicles, or (b) the requirement that Class 
members provide documentation of their vehicles' service history to receive repair 
reimbursements is unduly burdensome The Court considers the 23 Class member 
objections individually: 
a. Objection of Kunal A. Mirchandani 
Class member Kunal A. Mirchandani submitted an objection on February 29, 2016, 
arguing that the settlement agreement puts an unreasonable burden on Class members to 
provide documentation of the service histories of their Class Vehicles. ECF No. 75. Mr. 
Mirchandani claims that the requirement that Class members document their Vehicles' 
maintenance and repair history to receive reimbursement is unfair to the owners of used 
vehicles, who may not have the previous owners' service records, as well as to individuals 
who "may simply have discarded the records." Id. at 2-3. Although Mr. Mirchandani 
acknowledges that Class members may submit an affidavit [*29] of service from a 
mechanic in lieu of other documentation, he argues that mechanics are unlikely to 
remember servicing vehicles and that requiring Class members to obtain multiple affidavits 
if multiple mechanics have serviced a Vehicle is unreasonable. Id. at 3-4. 
The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the settlement's documentation requirement is not 
unreasonable. Plaintiffs claim that, even if individual mechanics do not recall servicing 
individual vehicles, "most, if not all, mechanics have access to a database . . . which would 
allow them to quickly and easily search the maintenance history of any given car that had 
service performed at that shop." ECF No. 92 at 22. The claims of 2,064 Class members 
have already been approved, demonstrating that the burden is not unduly onerous. ECF 
No. 107-1 ¶¶ 17-18. Finally, despite Mr. Mirchandani's claim that "Defendant is in a better 
position [than Class members] to research and review service records through its own 
dealership network," ECF No. 75 at 2, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants are not in a better 
position because they "do not have a central registry of dealer records or access to them."
