2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
to the plaintiff. r15] See, e.g., Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 598, 109 S. Ct. 
1378, 1382, 103 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1989). 
Rule 8(a)(2) generally sets the benchmark for determining whether a complaint's 
allegations are sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See lqbal v. Ashcroft, 556 U.S. 
662, 677-678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) ("Under Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a 'short and plain statement of the claim 
showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.' As the Court held in Twombly, . . . the 
pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' but it 
demands more than an unadorned, the defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation."). 
Indeed, "[a] pleading that offers 'labels and conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the 
elements of a cause of action will not do."' Id. at 678, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (quoting Bell 
Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1964-1965, 167 L. Ed. 2d 
929 (2007)). "Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders 'naked assertion[s]' devoid of 
'further factual enhancement."' Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557, 127 S. Ct. at 1955). 
To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true. to state a claim to 
relief that is plausible on its face. A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the 
court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard 
is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant r103] has acted 
unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads fads that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the 
lire between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief. 
Two working principles underlie our decision in Twombly. First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the 
allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause 
of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. Rule 8 marks a notable and generous deputise 
from the hyper-technical. code-pleading regime of a prior era. but it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff 
armed with nothing more than conclusions. Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a 
motion to dismiss. Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task 
that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. But where the well-pleaded 
facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of miscondud, the complaint has alleged--but it has 
not showfil-that the pleader is entitled to relief. 
Id. at 678-679, 129 S. Ct. at 1949-1950 (internal r17] citations and quotation marks 
omitted); see also id. at 680, 129 S. Ct. at 1950-1951 (a plaintiff must nudge his claims 
"across the line from conceivable to plausible."'); see Speaker v. United States Dept of 
Health & Human Services Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 623 F.3d 1371, 1381 
(11th Cir. 2010) ("[G]iven the pleading standards announced in Twombly and lqbal, 
[plaintiff] must do more than recite [] statutory elements in conclusory fashion. Rather, his 
allegations must proffer enough factual content to 'raise a right to relief above the 
speculative level."'). 
Ill. Discussion 
A. The TAC meets basic pleading requirements. 
BIC first argues that, as a general matter, the TAC does not contain enough factual 
allegations to meet the facial plausibility pleading standard explained in lqbal and 
Twombly. (Doc. 65 at 2-3.) The undersigned disagrees. With respect to BIC, the Plaintiff 
asserts fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence and wantonness claims. The 87-page 
and 164-paragraph TAC, with 20 pages of attached exhibits, contains more than enough 
facts to show that those claims are plausible on their face. (See doc. 64.) The Plaintiff 
alleges numerous facts to explain (1) the transactions at issue in this case through which
