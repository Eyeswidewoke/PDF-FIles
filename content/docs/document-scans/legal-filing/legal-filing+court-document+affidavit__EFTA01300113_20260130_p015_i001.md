economic competition between different parties who are in the same line of business. When a city or a country 
decides to integrate itself as an effective international player, it should not expect an easy journey full of roses 
and good wishes. 
Do you know how many major international airlines are closely monitoring Emirates' performance? Do you think 
that international port services companies are happy with the success accomplished by DP World in managing 
and operating dozens of ports around Europe, Asia and Africa? Do you expect international financial markets are 
pleased with Dubai Financial Market's success in its accusation of some of the world's most important financial 
markets in the world? 
I will tell you more. Emirates Airlines' successful model has not led only to achieving an internationally 
recognition but also has induced the launch of other Arab airlines that followed the same model. Emirates has 
encouraged many established Arab airlines to enhance their fleets and upgrade their services. This has ultimately 
led to increasing Arab airlines' share of the in ternational travel market. Leading by example, Emirates has set 
new benchmarks for quality services not only regionally but also internationally. One can only gain world 
recognition by proving success and ability to take the initiative, yet this recognition may not necessarily reflect 
acceptance.

There is no doubt that good planning is one of the key factors behind the success of the 
UAE, backed by the close monitoring of the ongoing challenges and opportunities. In your 
plans, what are the challenges that you foresee? What is the country's level of readiness to 
address them? 
Humans face challenges throughout their lives. Through commitment to proper planning of projects and 
programmes, and following up on their implementation, challenges can be successfully addressed. It is also 
crucial to anticipate challenges without ignoring any possibility. Yet, there are some unforeseen challenges that 
originate remotely but influence us — as in the global financial crisis that erupted in the United States and spread 
to the economies of developed countries and the rest of the world. One must be prepared to effectively deal with 
the implications of such challenges to one's country, economy and security. We, in the UAE, are aware of the 
challenges that we face and are always prepared for the worst, and are also willing to face whatever unforeseen 
developments regardless of their magnitude and im pact.

You have always stressed that the main challenge facing the Arab world, is that of the 
development of human resources in the knowledge era. Do you believe that the current 
education systems are equipped to prepare a new generation that is able to face this 
challenge and How? 
I am not in a position to assess the efficiency of the Arab educational institutions. But a common concern across 
the Arab world is the poor education systems at both school and university levels. The international rankings of 
the Arab universities are unsatisfactory to both the keen learners as well as the academic institutions. 
Yes, the main challenge facing the Arab world is the challenge of human development in the era of knowledge. 
Without the development of strong education systems, we will not easily achieve the desired development. 
Despite the importance of the state's role in the development of education, the development effort is the 
responsibility of society as a whole; the State must lead these efforts and involve the broadest segments of
