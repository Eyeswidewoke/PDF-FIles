This is the consciousness argument. In its extreme form 
the only unequivocal way to look at consciousness is solip-
sism—it's just me, babe. But 'Raring rejects that and works 
toward Jefferson's objection about writing a sonnet by consid-
ering whether a viva voce would satisfy him—an oral exam 
in which the interrogator asks detailed questions about the 
sonnet.' This leads to this interesting question: to what degree 
does InkWell know about the poems it writes? 
Inkwell certainly is not programmed to respond to ques-
tions such as "why did you use these particular words right 
here," but it has an accessible representation of the reasons 
for all its choices. InkWell decides which artistic choices to 
make, either through whimsy or by reading a text, how much 
to weigh them against each other, and which moods or out-
side influences to consider. These choices are enshrined in a 
misfit function InkWell constructs—InkWell composes the 
source code for this function and then compiles it—and all 
the choices sit in data structures. You might comment, "Ga-
briel, you're exaggerating all this," but these explicit traces 
are my answer to the difficult question, "how do you debug 
InkWell?" I need to see how and why all the decisions were 
made, because the only significant bugs arise from domain-
related mistakes, which manifest as surprising utterances 
and never exceptions or type errors. And to figure them out, 
I need to examine InkWell's state of mind, as it were. And 
were I so inclined, I could program InkWell to access more 
gently this self model when quizzed—more gently than by 
using data structure inspectors and debuggers. 
"I chose this pair of words because they sparked off each 
other well with syllable sounds without being blatant rhymes: 
because I wanted to come off as extraverted while channeling 
remorse: because I was trying to include a subtext of explo-
ration and discovery. They were also very Hemingwayesque. 
And the best other choices were these, and they just didn't 
measure up." Inkwell can't say that, but looking at its param-
eters, it's sense descriptions, its halos, its musicality settings. 
its target personality, the writer's ngrams it's trying to mimic, 
the recorded results of the component factors measured in 
InkWell's misfit function, etc. for a particular poem. I can 
trivially report it. 
One way to look at it is that InkWell has an effective, op-
erational self model, but Inkwell itself is not yet in that self 
model, and thus Inkwell is only partway toward being con-
scious. Inkwell modifies its own self model to change how 
it makes art. When we "talk" to InkWell about these inner 
changes and factors, we do so in a nonhuman language. and 
InkWell responds in the same language. 
Is this ok? Is this enough?

Turing wrote: 
We also wish to allow the possibility that an engineer 
or team of engineers may construct a machine which 
works, but whose manner of operation cannot be sat-
isfactorily described by its constructors because they 
have applied a method which is largely experimental. 
-Turing, Computing Machinery and Intelligence. 1950 
Today we read this as referring to machine learning. Some 
parts of InkWell are machine learned—judgments about per-
sonality and emotions in a text, for example. In some cases 
these judgments are baked into dictionaries and databases. 
The central part of InkWell is a meta-heuristic optimization 
process, the basis of whose operation can be explained, but 
whose detailed operation in any particular instance is a bit 
mysterious. The construction of the misfit function is sym-
bolic, and unpacking how that function directed the result 
of the optimization is explainable. 
That bird of prey poem: I felt a lot of doublenesses, 
and I love doublenesses. I wouldn't describe it as really 
dark, even though there is darkness in it. I find it also 
comical—not really funny. There's whimsy to it, a whimsy 
tone to it, both. This is a form of doubleness—dark and 
comical / whimsical—and I don't know how you do d—
how you, Richard, do it. This is a very large, small poem. 
It sounds quiet to me. The last line is not threatening, 
but the poem starts out threatening. Not to the exclu-
sion of others, but this one is really terrific. 
Raring remarks that Lady Lovelace wrote in her memoir the 
following (17]: 
The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate 
anything. It can do whatever we know how to order 
it to perform.

This leads to Thring's "surprise" concern: 
A better variant of the objection says that a machine 
can never 'take us by surprise.' 
-Turing, Computing Machinery and Intelligence. 1950 
Everyone—including 'TVring—who has ever programmed 
has been taken by surprise by their code. And not because of 
bugs and errors—and not because of randomness particularly. 
For Inkwell it's because of its relentlessness trying to find in-
teresting things, such as the phrase in the King James Bible
