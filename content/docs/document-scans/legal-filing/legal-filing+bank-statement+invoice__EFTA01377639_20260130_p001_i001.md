S-1/A 
notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
the same basis as the audited financial statements and reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments, which include 
only normal, recurring adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 
Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future, and the results in the nine 
months ended September 30, 2015. are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or any other period, 
in part because we do not intend to renew our payment processing agreement with Starbucks when it expires in the third 
quarter of 2016. Further, in August 2015 we amended our payment processing agreement with Starbucks to eliminate the 
exclusivity provision in order to permit Starbucks to begin transitioning to another payment processor starting October 1, 2015. 
Under the amendment. Starbucks also agreed to pay increased processing rates to us for as long as they continue to process 
transactions with us. Starbucks has announced that it will transition to another payment processor and will cease using our 
payment processing services altogether prior to the scheduled expiration of the agreement in the third quarter of 2016. As a 
result, Starbucks payment processing volumes will decrease meaningfully in the future. You should read the consolidated 
financial and other data below in conjunction with the section titled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this 
prospectus.
