both sides have been unwilling to include independent voices from civil society organizations in the 
talks in Addis Ababa, leading to skepticism about the parties' willingness to commit to forming a 
transitional unity government. Deterioration of the humanitarian crisis, including an outbreak of 
cholera and a looming famine, could lead to further displacement of people internally and across the 
region.

Egypt: July 3rd marked the first anniversary of the ousting of Muslim Brotherhood President 
Mohamed Morsi. A protest mounted by Islamist supporters was quickly quashed by Egyptian police: 
39 key activists were arrested ahead of the protests while 157 protestors were detained on the day. 
Several key districts in Cairo were affected as authorities closed various squares and cordoned off a 
number of main streets. While overall turnout for the protest was low, this is less an indicator of 
Islamist sentiment in Egypt than of fear of confronting the authorities at a time when anti-
Brotherhood attitudes remain overwhelming. Upcoming parliamentary elections, set to take place in 
the fall, will reveal a more accurate profile of Egyptian political leanings, particularly as Salafi factions 
are poised for a big win. President Al Sisi issued a decree on July 15th forming a Supreme Electoral 
Commission to oversee the election. 
On the economic front, the government has taken some of the boldest action in recent Egyptian 
history by implementing a series of subsidy reforms on July 4th. Fuel prices increased by 78%, while 
higher taxes on cigarettes and alcohol were put into place. The government also signed off on a 
capital gains tax and hinted that the price of electricity would increase over the next five years. While 
this decision was deemed a massive risk and an unpopular move—even President Al Sisi referred to it 
as "bitter medicine"—the blowback has been weaker than expected. It could yet provoke public 
anger, however, as food prices are likely to increase in light of higher transportation expenses 
associated with the fuel subsidy reform. This will be particularly true in Cairo, given that all food 
products are either transported from the countryside or brought in from port cities. Approximately 
30% of the Egyptian budget was spent on fuel and food subsidies before the reform. 
Iran: With the July 20th deadline looming, it appears the P5+1 nuclear talks with Iran may end 
inconclusively or require an extension. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif's called for an 
extension—an indicator that enough headway has been made that, in aril's words, "this is a process 
worth continuing." Secretary of State John Kerry told the press as he was leaving Vienna, the site of 
the talks, that he was headed back to Washington to consult with the US president and congress 
about "whether or not more time is warranted" for negotiations. 
Israel and Palestine: As the death toll mounts in the latest conflict, Egypt—in a first for the Sisi 
government—stepped in to negotiate a new ceasefire between the Israelis and Hamas following the 
recent cross border rocket attacks and airstrikes. Hamas turned down the proposal, which was 
supposed to take effect on July 15th. The rejection of the ceasefire is also telling of the new dynamic 
between Egypt and llamas: while the latter enjoyed a close relationship to the Morsi regime, the Sisi 
era has brought with it widespread popular hostility against Hamas, adding a layer of tension 
between the two sides (Hamas has gone as far as claiming that they were not even consulted on the 
ceasefire draft before it was submitted). Efforts to negotiate a ceasefire continue, as both the Israelis 
and Palestinians find themselves under enormous external pressure to stop the fighting. Press reports
