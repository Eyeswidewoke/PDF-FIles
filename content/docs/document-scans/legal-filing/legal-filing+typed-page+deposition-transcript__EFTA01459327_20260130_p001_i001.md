Tax Treatment 
You should review carefully the section entitled 'Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the accompanying product 
supplement no. 4a-l. The following discussion, when read in combination with that section, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax 
counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of notes. 
Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel it is reasonable to treat the notes as 'open transactions' 
that are not debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as more fully described in "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax 
Consequences — Tax Consequences to U S. Holders — Notes Treated as Open Transactions That Are Not Debt Instruments' in the 
accompanying product supplement no. 4a-l. Assuming this treatment is respected. the gain or loss on your notes should be treated as 
long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the 
issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or toss 
on the notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting 
comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of 'prepaid forward contracts' and similar instruments. The notice focuses in 
particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for 
comments on a number of related topics. including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of 
factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including 
any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax, and whether these instruments are or 
should be subject to the "constructive ownership' regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital 
gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and 
effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and 
adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes. possibly with retroactive effect You should consult your tax 
adviser regarding the U S federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes. including possible alternative treatments 
and the issues presented by this notice. 
Withholding under legislation commonly referred to as 'FATCA' may (if the notes are recharacterized as debt instruments) apply to 
amounts treated as interest paid with respect to the notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying product 
supplement no. 4a-1, under a recent IRS notice, withholding under FATCA will not apply to payments of gross proceeds (other than any 
amount treated as interest) of a taxable disposition, including redemption at maturity, of the notes You should consult your tax adviser 
regarding the potential application of FATCA to the notes. 
JPMS's Estimated Value of the Notes 
JPMS's estimated value of the notes set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following 
hypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income debt component with the same maturity as the notes, valued using our internal funding 
rate for structured debt described below, and (2) the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes. JPMS's 
estimated value does not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any 
exists) at any time. The internal funding rate used in the determination of JPMS's estimated value generally represents a discount from 
the credit spreads for our conventional fixed-rate debt. For additional information, see "Selected Risk Considerations — JPMS's 
Estimated Value Is Not Determined by Reference to Credit Spreads for Our Conventional Fixed-Rate Debt " 
The value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from JPMS's internal pricing models. 
These models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other 
inputs, some of which are market-observable, and which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as well as 
assumptions about future market events and/or environments. Accordingly. JPMS's estimated value of the notes is determined when 
the terms of the notes are set based on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time. 
JPMS's estimated value does not represent future values of the notes and may differ from others' estimates. Different pricing models 
and assumptions could provide valuations for notes that are greater than or less than JPMS's estimated value. In addition, market 
conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On future dates. the 
value of the notes could change significantly based on. among other things, changes in market conditions, our creditworthiness, interest 
rate movements and other relevant factors. which may impact the price, if any, at which JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in 
secondary market transactions. 
JPMS's estimated value of the notes will be lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling. 
structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions 
paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, the projected profits, if any. that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming
