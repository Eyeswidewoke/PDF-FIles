sporting exchanges and the like. Steps to empo=er Iranian civil society economically, counter internal censorship and 
pro=aganda, and spread goodwill between the two countries' populations are a=l consistent with US security interests 
once the nuclear weapons threat is reliably controlled. 
What President Obam= should avoid, however, is encumbering the nuclear negotiation with other =ssues complicating 
US-Iran relations. "We are not seeking regime change,=94 Mr. Obama declared at the UN in September. This statement 
cleverly spoke to two audiences—the clerics in Tehran who=e singular priority is remaining in power; and the president's 
domestic =olitical allies who associate 'regime change' with neoconservative att=tudes favored in the previous 
administration. 
A more appropriate =ormulation in the President's speech would have made clear that if his A=ministration does not 
seek regime change, it carries no particular brief t= maintain this regime in power either. The principle of popular 
sovereignty should be at the heart of US policy, =nd given the storied history of US meddling in Iranian politics, Iranian 
l=aders would be hard-pressed to complain if an American president said that=the Iranian people should have the 
ultimate say in how they are governed. 
The fact is that Ha=san Rouhani and the Iranian Foreign Ministry do not represent the Islamic =epublic on some major 
issues relevant to negotiations in the Middle East. =he commander of the elite Qods Force atop the Revolutionary 
Guards organization, Qassem Suleimani, is leading t=e effort in Syria to train and resupply Lebanese Hezbollah fighters in 
def=nse of the Assad regime—a vital interest to the Tehran regime, as noted.=Suleimani also appears to run the "Iraq" 
account for Tehran, coordinating with Prime Minister Maliki in =upport of extralegal killings of defenseless Iranian 
dissidents inside Ira= by a special unit of Iraqi forces attached to the Prime Minister's offi=e. 
The paramilitary ca=paigns supported by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in Syria and Iraq are no= unconnected to American 
interests. In Iraq, five armed attacks since mid-=009 by Iraqi military units, or by Iranian-supplied militias passing through 
their lines, against more than 3,000 unarmed Iran=an dissidents place the United States in breach of its obligations 
under t=e Fourth Geneva Convention. A promise of protection, formally given by the=US to every one of these 
individuals in 2004, remains an American duty today because the Iraqi government has r=peatedly violated its 2009 
commitment to provide protection for these peop=e, engaging instead in lethal attacks against them in coordination 
with Te=ran. 
The US understandab=y wants a robust and lasting security assistance relationship with Iraq'= armed forces after so 
much sacrifice by American forces in Iraq. Yet it i= compromised by its failure to live up to not only international 
humanitarian law, but Section 3 of the Arms Expo=t Control Act prohibiting arms transfers to militaries that misuse 
them, a=d the so-called Leahy Human Rights laws prohibiting training for any milit=ry units implicated in gross human 
rights violations. 
The latest assault,=the September 1 execution of 52 defenseless Iranian exiles by Iraqi specia= forces using handcuffs 
and silencers, and the abduction of seven others w=o are still missing, occurred five days after Qassem Suleimani met 
with Prime Minister Maliki and his aides t= plan the operation, according to the exiled group, the MEK. The massacre 
=ent largely unreported in the American media, the story overshadowed by th= September 2 announcement in Tehran 
of President Rouhani's plans to travel to the United States. 
America's policy =apses in both Syria and Iraq, the portfolio directly overseen by Qassim Su=eimani on Iran's behalf, 
come as well at the expense of Iran's regiona= strategic rival: the Sunni Arab world and Saudi Arabia in particular. Writes 
veter=n international correspondent Arnaud de Borchgrave chttp://www.upi.com/Top_Newshnalysiside-
Borchgrave/2013/10/15/Commentary-Geopolitical-amnesia/UPI-68501=81836239/> , "The longer t=e fighting in Syria, 
the more the situation in Iraq deteriorates and the c=oser Iran's military Imullahocracy' comes to dominating the entire 
r=gion."
