For example, SARB's pre-emptive rate hike in 
November did not provide any material support to the 
rand. On the other hand, SARB can allow the currency 
to continue to be the adjustment valve to low growth 
and external imbalances, as pass-through to inflation 
has thus far been limited; spot headline CPI is at 4.8% 
YoY, well within the 3.6% target range. Further, an 
aggressive hiking cycle (+170bps in 2016) is already 
priced into the rates market, which we do not expect to 
be delivered (DB forecast is for only +75bps).

the recent past, and is unlikely to do so now with 
elevated risks on both the external and domestic fronts. 
Further, in productivity-adjusted PPP terms, ZAR 
undervaluation is not yet at extreme levels, where we 
believe it should trade. ZAR TWI has around 6% further 
depreciation to go on this metric, which implies 
roughly an 8% move higher in USDZAR. Additionally, 
as global growth is currently generating only half as 
much trade growth as in earlier periods, greater FX 
adjustment is now required to correct external 
imbalances.

Other EMEA high betas: neutral on TRY and RUB 
TRY performed poorly in 2015 as domestic political 
uncertainty combined with a general EM FX sell-off. 
The focus has shifted from political uncertainty to 
policy direction (and quality), concern around which 
comes from three sources and continues to weigh on 
the lira. First, recent government comments have 
altered market perception about intensity of political 
externality on the CBT or a quicker-than-expected 
move towards executive presidency. Second, CBT 
credibility has likely fallen and monetary policy 
uncertainty increased following the Bank's inaction at 
the late-December meeting, where a hike in the base 
rate and narrowing of the corridor was expected. CBT's 
pro-growth bias could imply a reluctance to maintain 
rate differentials with the US, which clearly represents 
a risk for TRY and for the already elevated inflation - it 
also likely increases TRY's beta to adverse external 
shocks. Third, geopolitical concerns have risen, 
particularly on the deteriorating relations with Russia. 
These policy risks are somewhat offset by fundamental 
factors: growth is expected at 3-3.5%, which is 
reasonably good compared to the rest of EM; 
valuations on our fundamental metrics are attractive; 
carry is substantial even in vol-adjusted terms; Turkey 
is a commodity importer with limited direct trade links 
to China. 
RUB movements in the near-term will be driven by 
crude; we therefore remain neutral for now given the 
volatility and continued search for the bottom in crude. 
If crude stabilizes, there are some reasons to be 
constructive on RUB: we expect monetary easing to be 
less aggressive than currently priced; growth and 
inflation are set to improve from a low base; valuations 
are attractive; double-digit carry provides a substantial 
buffer; FX reserves are large and the current account is 
in surplus; there is potential for sanctions to be lifted 
next year, improving capital flows and sentiment.
