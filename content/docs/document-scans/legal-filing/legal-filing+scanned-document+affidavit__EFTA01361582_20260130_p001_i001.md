The Talented Mr. Epstein; Lately, Jeffrey Epstein's high-ying style has been drawing oohs 
and aahs: the bachelor nancier lives in New York's largest private residence, claims to 
take only billionaires as clients, and ies celebrities including Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey 
on his Boeing 727. But pierce his air of mystery and the picture changes. VICKY WARD 
explores Epstein's investment career, his ties to retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his 
complicated past Vanity Fair March 2003 
According to a source, Toboroff and Nederlander told Epstein that Snyder was too late, 
but, without their realizing it, Hoffenberg has claimed, Snyder wrote a check to Hoffenberg 
and bought out some of his investment. But then Snyder wanted out. 
"Nederlander started to get these irate calls from (Snyder,) who wasn't part of the deal, 
saying he was owed all this money," says someone close to the deal. Toboroff and 
Nederlander were baffled. 
Eventually, a source close to Hoffenberg says, Hoffenberg paid Snyder off. 
Just as Nederlander and Toboroff were growing wary of Epstein, he became increasingly 
involved with Leslie Wexner, whom he had met through insurance executive Robert 
Meister and his late wife. Epstein has told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in Palm 
Beach, and that he won his confidence by persuading him not to invest in the stock 
market, just as the 1987 crash was approaching. His story has subsequently changed. 
When asked if Wexner knew about his connection to Hoffenberg, Epstein said that he 
began working for Wexner in 1989, and that "it was certainly not the same time." 
Wherever and whenever it was that Epstein and Wexner actually met, there was an 
immediate and strong personal chemistry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is "very smart 
with a combination of excellent judgment and unusually high standards. Also, he is always 
a most loyal friend." 
Sources say Epstein proved that he could be useful to Wexner as well, with "fresh" ideas 
about investments. "Wexner had a couple of bad investments, and Jeffrey cleaned those 
up right away," says a former associate of Epstein's. 
Before he signed on with Wexner, Epstein had several meetings with Harold Levin, then 
head of Wexner Investments, in which he enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin 
found incomprehensible. "In fact," says someone who used to work very closely with 
Wexner, "almost everyone at the Limited wondered who Epstein was; he literally came out 
of nowhere." 
"Everyone was mystified as to what his appeal was," says Robert Morosky, a former vice-
chairman of the Limited. 
Much of Epstein's work is related to cleaning up, tightening budgets, and efficiencies. One 
person who worked for Wexner and who saw a contract drawn up between the two men 
says Epstein is involved in "everything, not just a little here, a little there. Everything!" In 
addition, he says, "Wexner likes having a hatchet man... Whenever there is dirty work to 
be done he'd stick Jeffrey on it... He has a reputation for being ruthless but he gets the job 
done." 
Epstein has evidently been asked to fire personal-staff members when needed. "He was 
that mysterious person that everyone was scared to death of," says a former employee. 
Meanwhile, he is also less than popular with some people outside Wexner's company with 
whom he now deals. "He 'inserted' himself into the construction process of Leslie Wexner's 
yacht... That resulted in litigation down the road between Mr. Wexner and the shipyard that
