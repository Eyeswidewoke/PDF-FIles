2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
459, 461 (Wash. 1985); RCW 19.36.010; RCW 64.04.010; RCW 64.04.020. Full 
performance by one party removes the case from the operation p23] of the statute. 
Becker v. Lagerquist Bros., 55 Wn.2d 425, 348 P.2d 423, 430 (Wash. 1960). With respect 
to contracts regarding real property, sufficient part performance can remove the agreement 
from the statute of frauds. Berg v. Ting, 125 Wn.2d 544, 886 P.2d 564, 571 (Wash. 1995). 
However, the doctrine of part performance does not apply to contracts that by their terms 
are not to be performed in one year. Trethewey v. Bancroft-Whitney Co., 13 Wn. App. 353, 
534 P.2d 1382, 1386 (Wash. 1975) ("[W]here the statute is directed solely to the time of 
performance and not to the character or subject-matter of the contract, part performance 
could not remove the ban of the statute without in effect repealing the statute.") 
In the same vein, modifications of contracts falling within the statute of frauds must also be 
made in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Anderson v. 
Anderson, 128 Wash. 504, 223 P. 323, 324 (Wash. 1924). However, contract modifications 
that have been executed, as well as executory modifications that have been sufficiently 
partially performed, are exempt. Id.; see also Canso!. Elec. Distribs., Inc. v. Gier, 24 Wn. 
App. 671, 602 P.2d 1206, 1210 (Wash. 1979); Oregon & W. R. Co. v. Elliott Bay Mill & 
Lumber Co., 70 Wash. 148, 126 P. 406, 407 (Wash. 1912) (finding that an oral agreement 
between a lessee and a sublessee to modify the terms of the lease was valid because it 
was partially performed). 
Here, it is undisputed that Mr. Steadman is unable to supply a copy of the modification 
agreement signed by BoA.5 (See Steadman Dep. at 35:1-17.) As a result, the statute of 
frauds would ordinarily render the alleged [" 24] modification of Mr. Steadman's loan 
unenforceable. However, after examining the controlling law, the court concludes that, in 
this situation, there is a question of fact as to whether Green Tree is estopped from 
asserting the statute of frauds as a defense. 
5 The cart notes that the absence of a Modification Agreement signed by BoA does not rule out a finding of a valid contract 
See Jacob's Meadow Owners Ass'n v. Plateau 44 
!LC, 139 Wn. App. 743. 162 P.3d 1153, 1165-66 (Wash. Ct. App. 2007) 
(finding that signatures of the parties were not essential to a finding of mutual assert to enter into a contract): Carvallo v. Wells 
Fargo Bank, NA 728 F.3d 878, 883 (9th Cir. 2013), as amended on rehg in part (Sept. 23. 2013) (disagreeing with a bank's 
argument that, even upon successful completion of a Trial Period, there could be no loan modification contract unless and unit 
the bank sect the borrower a signed copy of the Modification Agreement because the barks position "made the existence of 
any obligation conditional solely on action of the bard and "allowed banks to avoid their obligations to borrowers merely by 
choosing not to send a signed Modification Agreement. even though the borrowers made both accurate representations and the 
required payments"). 
The statute of frauds applies for two reasons. To begin, it appears at first glance that Mr. 
Steadman's loan, p25] by its terms, is not to be performed within one year. See RCW 
19.36.010; Turning Point Cmty. Church of God in Christ v. Lee, 152 Wash. App. 1014, at 
*3-4 [published in full-text format at 2009 Wash. App. LEXIS 2336] (2009).° After all, the 
loan binds Mr. Steadman to make monthly payments to the lender over the course of 30 
years. (See Note); Lectus, Inc. v. Rainier Nat. Bank, 97 Wn.2d 584, 647 P.2d 1001, 1003 
(Wash. 1982) (finding that a contract calling for monthly payments over a period of five 
years was within the statute of frauds). Because the doctrine of part performance is 
inapplicable to contracts of this type, Trethewey, 534 P.2d at 1386, and Mr. Steadman 
does not provide an agreement signed by BoA, the alleged oral modification would 
ordinarily be unenforceable.
