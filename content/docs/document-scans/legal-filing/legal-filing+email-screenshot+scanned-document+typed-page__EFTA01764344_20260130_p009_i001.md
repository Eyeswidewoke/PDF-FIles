Why the Middl= East is in Torment 
Patrick Seale 
6 Nov 2012 -- The Middle East is plagued by death, destruction =nd population displacements. A dozen different 
conflicts are raging. The w=ole region has rarely been in such torment. 
In Syria, a bitter fratricidal war, largely fuelled by outsiders, threatens=to reduce the country to a smouldering ruin, 
while consigning tens of thou=ands to the grave. Its neighbours are suffering from the spill-over. Turke= is struggling 
with a flood of Syrian refugees and a revival of Kurdish militancy. Lebanon and Jordan hav= been dangerously 
destabilised, and fear the worst. Iraq, once a powerful =rab state, was destroyed and dismembered by America's 
invasion and bruta= ten-year occupation. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were killed or wounded and millions 
displaced. Materia= damage was enormous. The once united country was transformed into a far w=aker federal state by 
the creation of an autonomous Kurdish enclave in the=north. Although Iraq's oil industry is now recovering, its society 
and its politics remain highly unstable. Ju=t as America's invasion in 2003 was launched on the fraudulent claim tha= Iraq 
was developing weapons of mass destruction, so the United States and=its allies are now waging an undeclared war 
against Iran -- a war of crippling sanctions, cyber-subversion and ass=ssinations. The alleged aim is to force Iran to give 
up its development of=nuclear weapons -- although there is no credible evidence that Iran is doi=g any such thing. The 
real aim would seem to be 'regime change' in Tehran. A military attack on Iran =n the New Year cannot be excluded. 
After eleven years of war in Afghanistan, the United States and its allies =ave failed to stabilise the country, let alone 
devise a credible exit stra=egy. Their planned departure in 2014 seems likely to turn into a humiliati=g scuttle, while 
plunging the country into an even more murderous civil war. Meanwhile, Egypt and Tunisia strugg=e to tame their 
Salafists, while armed gangs in Libya vie for supremacy. 
In Mali, a war is in preparation to expel militant Islamic groups which hav= captured the northern part of the country 
and threaten the stability of t=e whole Sahel. In Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and soon possibly in Mali as w=ll, U.S. 
'targeted killings' of alleged Islamic terrorists by means of pilotless drones also kill civilian= and terrorise peaceful 
communities, driving relations between the United =tates and the Muslim world to new depths of misunderstanding and 
hostility= Meanwhile, unchecked by either the Arab states or the Western powers, Israel continues its relentless seizure 
of Palestinian territory, finally burying any hope of a two-state solu=ion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and 
condemning itself to generati=ns of future conflict with the Arab and Muslim world. 
How has all this come about? What false moves and foolhardy decisions have =rought the region to this lamentable 
state? In my personal opinion, the fo=lowing are some of the main reasons. 
• As everyone knows, America's invasion of Iraq triggered a civil war b=tween the Sunni minority and the Shia majority, 
inflaming antagonisms betw=en these two Muslim communities right across the region. The war transform=d Iraq's 
regional role. Instead of acting as a counterweight to Iran -- which had long been Iraq's traditio=al role -- Iraq under Shia 
leadership has become Iran's ally. 
This has overturned the balance of power in the Gulf region to the alarm of=Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Gulf 
Cooperation Council. Fear that Ira= has ambitions to dominate the Gulf region has shaped the thinking and the=regional 
policy of Saudi Arabia and some of its GCC partners. The fear may not be wholly justified, but it=is real nevertheless. 
• By removing Egypt, the most powerful Arab country, from the Arab milita=y line-up, the Egypt-Israel peace treaty of 
1979 eliminated any possibilit= of a balance of power between Israel and its Arab neighbours. It gave Isr=el the freedom 
to attack its neighbours with impunity and fuelled its ambition for regional dominance. One need on=y recall Israel's 
strike on Iraq's Osirak nuclear facility in1981 and =ts invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Many more aggressions were to 
follow. In I=rael itself, the rise of right-wing and ultra-religious forces hardened the country's determination to expan= 
its land area and prevent any expression of Palestinian statehood, while =aintaining Israel's military supremacy over the 
entire Greater Middle Ea=t. 
• Israel's belligerent and expansionist policy has largely been made po=sible by the considerable influence of American 
Jews on American politics.=The U.S. Congress seems to have succumbed to AIPAC, the main Jewish lobby.=At the same
