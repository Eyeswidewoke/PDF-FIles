S-I/A 
bylaws, and provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt. 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law contain 
provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our 
board of directors and therefore depress the trading price of our Class A common stock. 
Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include 
provisions (i) creating a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms: (ii) authorizing "blank 
check" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may

contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock; (iii) limiting the ability of our stockholders to call 
special meetings; (iv) eliminating the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting or to remove directors 
without cause; and (v) requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our 
stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors. These provisions, alone or together, could 
delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. 
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware 
General Corporation Law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding capital stock from 
engaging in certain business combinations without the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least two-thirds of our 
outstanding capital stock not held by such stockholder. 
Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, or Delaware law that 
has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could firrit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for 
their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common 
stock. 
Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and 
exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability 
to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. 
Our amended and restated bylaws, which will become effective prior to the completion of this offering, provide that, unless 
we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum 
for () any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by 
any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or to our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to 
the Delaware General Corporation Law: or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of 
forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our 
directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other 
employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be 
inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other 
jurisdictions, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business. 
Our management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds and may apply the proceeds of this offering in ways 
that may not improve our business or increase the value of your investments. 
We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital. 
operating expenses, and capital expenditures. We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds to us from 
this offering. Accordingly, our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and you will not 
have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. Until the 
net proceeds are used, they may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value.
