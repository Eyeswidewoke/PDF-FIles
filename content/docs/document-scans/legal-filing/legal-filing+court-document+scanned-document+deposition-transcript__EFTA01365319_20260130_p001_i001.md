provided to S&P from such Obligor); 
(ii) 
(a) if there is not an issuer credit rating of the Obligor or its guarantor by S&P. but there 
is a rating by S&P on a senior secured obligation of the Obligor or its guarantor. then the S&P 
Rating of the Collateral Obligation or Collateral Obligation will be one subcategory below such 
rating; (b) if there is not a rating by S&P on a senior secured obligation of the Obligor or its 
guarantor, but there is a rating by S&P on a senior unsecured obligation of the Obligor or its

if an obligation of the Obligor or its guarantor is publicly rated by Moody's, then the

Moody's Rating set forth above, except that the S&P Rating of such obligation will be (I) one 
subcategory' below the S&P equivalent of the rating assigned by Moody's if such security is rated 
"Baa3" or higher by Moody's and (2) two subcategories below the S&P equivalent of the rating 
assigned by Moody's if such security is rated "Bar or lower by Moody's; provided that Collateral

S&P Rating based on a rating given by Moody's as provided in this subelause (A) (after giving 
effect to the addition of the relevant Collateral Obligation, if applicable): 
(B) 
if no other security or obligation of the Obligor or its guarantor is rated by S&P or 
Moody's, then the Collateral Manager may apply to S&P for a S&P credit rating estimate, which 
will be its S&P Rating provided that pending such application the S&P Rating of such Collateral 
Obligation will be deemed to be "CCC+" if the Collateral Manager reasonably believes that the 
appropriate credit rating is "CCC+" or greater, or otherwise "CCC-"; provided however, that if 
the S&P credit estimate actually assigned to any obligation that had been deemed to have an S&P 
Rating of "CCC+" pursuant to this provision pending such estimate is lower than "CCC+", 
thereafter the S&P Rating of any obligation pending assignment of a credit estimate shall be 
"CCC-"; or 
(C) 
if such Collateral Obligation is not rated by Moody's or S&P, no other security or 
obligation of the Obligor or its guarantor is rated by S&P or Moody's and if the Collateral
