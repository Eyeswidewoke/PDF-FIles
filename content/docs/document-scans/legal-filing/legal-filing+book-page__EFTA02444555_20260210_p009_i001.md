The Whiteside. Lab 
606-064 
Whitesides also had ongoing collaborative projects with scientists outside his lab, and continuing 
work with alums of the lab (see Exhibit 9). Usually outside collaborations were undertaken when 
specific expertise was needed, adding coordination costs to project budgets. As one member of the 
lab noted, "One of the virtues of having a big and diversified research group is that most of the skills 
that are needed on a project can often be found inside the lab?' 
The impact of the Whitesides lab ranged well beyond publication of first-rate research papers. A 
large number of graduates established their own outstanding research groups. As Art Ellis' noted, 
"George attracts outstanding individuals from around the world to his laboratories. Many of these 
individuals then start their own independent research groups and develop successful programs that 
further amplify the number of researchers being trained." University of Chicago chemistry professor 
Rustem Ismagilov reflected on what he learned at the Whitesides lab: 
I don't think many people appreciate how much time George spends on every paper. Each 
paper goes through 10 to 20 drafts before it is submitted. George reads each draft and 
provides exceptionally detailed feedback. He teaches people how to write. He teaches people 
how to think about what a conclusive experiment is. And he teaches people how to think about 
what the strong, important questions are. The review process he set up is very educational. In 
my research group, I do not do it as formally just yet, but i do emphasize how important it is to 
start thinking about formulating questions and hypotheses before doing the experiment, and 
not after having collected data and having analyzed them to realize that the main control 
experiment is missing and that the data are not conclusive. Following his example, I tell my 
students not to settle for the comfortable, simple thing that can be done. I tell them they should 
keep looking and thinking further. 
Funding the Research 
Following World War 11, the US. federal government assumed the primary role for funding 
academic research in science and technology. Most academic labs had a mix of research grants and 
contracts from federal agencies in addition to some support from university and industrial sources. 
Some students and postdocs secured their own funding (mostly in the form of a fellowship to cover 
living expenses and fees), but it was the responsibility of the leader of the lab to provide funding for 
research through proposal writing. Most researchers found this to be time-consuming and onerous, 
yet many believed it was valid competition in the marketplace of ideas. No one found wide support 
for an alternative system? 
In 2005 four federal agencies provided the primary support to the Whitesides Lab: the National 
Science Foundation (NSF); the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had grown rapidly as a 
primary funding source in the fields of biology and life sciences research; the Department of Defense 
5 Examples of frequent collaborators were Don Ingber ( Professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School and Children's 
Hospital), Mara Prentiss (Harvard Professor of Physics), Howard Stone (Harvard Professor of Engineering and Applied Math), 
and Ralph Nuzzo (University of Illinois Chemistry Professor). 
'Art Ellis was the Meloche-Bascom Professor of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and director of the Division 
of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation. Views expressed by Ellis were his own and did not necessarily reflect the 
views of the National Science Foundation. 
7Most funds were directed to a principal investigator; however, a small number of large research grants came as "block funds" 
to mission-oriented research centers. These center grants were usually for a period of up to Ave years, with opportunities for 
renewal. In rare cases, labs or centers had endowments or other forms of private support to for continuity of research programs 
or for high risk and exploratory projects.
