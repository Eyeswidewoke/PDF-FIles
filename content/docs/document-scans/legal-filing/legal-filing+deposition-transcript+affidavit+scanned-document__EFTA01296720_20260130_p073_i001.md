2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87203, * 
grand jury indictment against Epstein. (DE 189 at 10) ('The victim's CVRA injury is not the 
government's failure to prosecute Epstein federally--an end within the sole control of the 
government."). Rather, the harm in this case arose from the Government's alleged failure 
to confer adequately with Petitioners before deciding to abandon a federal case against 
Epstein. (Id.). The Court has reviewed the portions of the submitted documents to which 
grand jury secrecy is invoked, and it finds that none of the grand jury materials produced 
has a bearing on the Government's alleged failure to confer with Petitioners [92] before 
electing to forego a federal prosecution. 
The Court also concludes that Petitioner's asserted need to prove that the Government 
had an "extremely strong case against Epstein" does not justify the disclosure of secret 
grand jury materials. Petitioners seek to use the grand jury materials as the means to an 
improper end—a judicial determination that the Government made an inexplicably poor 
decision when it decided not to prosecute Epstein. 
"[T]he Government retains 'broad discretion' as to whom to prosecute." Wayte v. United 
States, 470 U.S. 598, 607, 105 S. Ct. 1524, 84 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1985). The CVRA 
incorporates this principle, providing that "[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to 
impair the prosecutorial discretion" of federal prosecutors. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6). Courts 
tread lightly where prosecutorial discretion is concerned because "the decision to 
prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review." Wayte, 470 U.S. at 607; see also 35 
Geo. L.J. Ann. Rev. Crim. Proc. 203, 203 n.648 (2006). "Such factors as the strength of 
the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement 
priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not 
readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake." Wayte, 
470 U.S. at 607 (emphasis added); see also Town of Newton v. Rumery, 480 U.S. 386, 
396, 107 S. Ct. 1187, 94 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1987) (courts normally must defer to prosecutorial 
decisions [13] about whom to prosecute because, "[i]n addition to assessing the strength 
and importance of a case, prosecutors also must consider other tangible and intangible 
factors, such as government enforcement priorities.") (emphasis added). 
Petitioners asserted strategy of demonstrating that the Government had an improper 
motive to hide its "extremely strong" case asks the Court to decide (or assume) that the 
Government did in fact have an "extremely strong" case against Epstein. As Petitioners 
point out, the Government has not admitted that it believed it had a "strong case" for 
prosecution. (DE 266 at 8).31n light of this refusal to admit the strength of the case, 
Petitioners seek grand jury materials to present to the Court the case for prosecuting 
Epstein. (Id. at 9). Basically, Petitioners ask the Court to interject itself in place of the 
Government and adjudicate whether the Government erred, and thus had a motive for 
hiding its error, when it decided not to prosecute Epstein. As the Supreme Court has 
articulated, "courts are [not] competent to undertake" the kind of analysis necessary to 
assess the "strength of the case" for or against any particular prosecution. Wayte, 470 
U.S. at 607; see also United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 465, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 134 
L. Ed. 2d 687 (1996) (Judicial deference [94] to prosecutors' decisions "rests in part on 
an assessment of the relative competence of prosecutors and courts."). Nor is the Court 
competent to undertake an analysis of how strong the Government perceived its case 
against Epstein at the time it decided not to prosecute. Stated plainly, whether the 
Government had a "strong" case against Epstein was for the Government to decide in its
