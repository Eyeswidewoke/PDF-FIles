Permanent Polio Teams in southern Afghanistan have long been credited as the program's flagship 
innovation. They have provided polio drops to 146,000 children, including almost 9,000 who had never 
previously received a dose of the vaccine. Key to their success is their low visibility and step-wise 
introduction. However, their geographic coverage is limited, and they are active in only five of the 
thirteen high-risk districts of southern Afghanistan. 
Somalia 
Somalia is highly prone to public-health crises, including outbreaks of cholera, typhoid, malaria, and 
measles. Recently the country has seen an outbreak of polio, which as of the end of July 2013 had 
paralyzed 105 children, where previously a case of polio had not been recorded in more than five years. 
Somalia is one of the countries in the "wild poliovirus importation belt"—a band of countries stretching 
from west Africa to central Africa and the Horn of Africa, which are recurrently re-infected with imported 
polio virus. Although the situation varies across Somalia, parts of the country have been torn apart by 
decades of conflict, chronic poverty, inequality, food insecurity, and public-health challenges. It was 
ranked 165th out of 170 in the 2012 Human Development Index in 2010, with 74% living on less than 
US$2 per day. Life expectancy across the country is a mere 50 years and the youth population of Somalia 
(14-29 years) is a disproportionately high 42% of the population. The country is highly prone to 
humanitarian emergencies, particularly drought and famine, due to very low rainfall, the on-going 
conflict, and increasing deforestation. 
It is likely that the greatest challenge in implementing the polio vaccination campaign will be security 
concerns, as foreign aid organisations are unable to access parts of the country still prone to conflict or 
under Al-Shabaab control. Somalia is navigating the most promising landscape for peace and stability 
that the country has seen in more than two decades, but Al-Shabaab remains a major spoiler to all 
peacebuilding and development initiatives in the country. Al-Shabaab has splintered following a "coup" 
which resulted in the killing of one of the group's co-founders, Ibrahim al-Afghani, an Al Quaeda—trained 
fighter who also fought in Afghanistan, and two further leaders have been forced to flee in recent 
months. The splintering of the group has triggered a wave of fresh violence as different factions fight for 
control of power and territory. The recent spate of violence in Mogadishu, the June car-bombing of the 
UN compound, and the shooting at a Swedish diplomat in August are all examples of the risk posed by 
the group. The constant threat has a very real impact on aid and development efforts in the country; for 
example, Medecins Sons Frontieres announced in August 2013 it is closing all its programs in the country 
after a 22-year presence due to attacks on staff. 
Common Themes 
The areas in which polio has been found may be geographically dispersed, but they share some 
significant common characteristics: they are comparatively small, difficult to access, and with little or no 
presence of the state that has allowed local power brokers to define the debate. 
These regions have been subject to longstanding misinformation campaigns, whether intentionally or a 
by-product of a broader political or ideological agenda, and this has resulted in the health of children 
being put at risk. Local governments have been unwilling or unable to provide for the public health of 
their citizens. Non-state actors (i.e. religious, tribal, or community leaders, as well as armed groups) are 
filling this vacuum in a malign way, including by misinforming communities on the dangers of polio and 
the benefit of vaccination campaigns. In turn, in all of the regions families are seen avoiding or refusing 
to have their children vaccinated for polio.
