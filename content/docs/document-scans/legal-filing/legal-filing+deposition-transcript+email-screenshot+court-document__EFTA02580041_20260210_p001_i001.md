Re: speakers pool house LSJ 
Jeffrey, 
Are you ask=ng to add additional tweeters / Horns to the system? 
If your referring to the flag pole pool system, it appears the tw=eters are 1" horn loaded compression driver. Currently 
installed I the Tech=oMads. 
=div style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">Specs below: 
The NOHO C Install verision is a weatherproof 2-way full-range=430 watt loudspeaker with a Mil-Spec polymer cabinet, 
WeatherTech'" g=ill system, 8 x 1/4-20 T-nut flypoints, 4 x 5/16 T-nuts for bracket mountin=, 2 x 3/8-16 threaded inserts 
for Yoke mounting, 2 x Neutrik 4MP connectors= 1 x 12"coaxial driver. 
The smallest of t=e high-powered AS Series of loudspeakers, the Noho C is designed for use in=abusive, real-world 
situations, both on the road or in permanent installati=ns. Combining superrugged, U.S. Armed Forces road case 
technology with a nu=ber of acoustic innovations, the Noho C is a compact and durable loudspeake= that is very 
powerful and musically accurate. 
The Noho C is the perfect unit for any application where compact size=and high power are required. Technomad's 
unique cabinet tuning delivers exc=ptional bass extension and articulation from a small loudspeaker cabinet. T=e Noho C 
is extremely EQ compliant and offers the user unrivaled control ov=r every type of program material. The cast frame 
coaxial driver used in the=Noho C insures point source clarity, high power handling and long life. Onl= the highest-
quality metalized polypropylene capacitors and heavy gauge ind=ctors are used in Technomad networks, minimizing 
insertion loss and resulti=g in smooth response throughout the operating bandwidth. 
The Noho C is designed for maximum flexibility and ease of u=e. 1.5" diameter stand-mount sockets are molded into the 
cabinet on all fou= sides for tripod mounting in either vertical or horizontal orientation. Fo=r 1/4-20 threaded inserts on 
the top and right sides of the cabinet allow t=e Noho to be flown easily with eyebolts. On the Tour Model version, the 
inc=uded lid protects the speaker during transport. A large handle on each end m=kes carrying the Noho C extremely 
easy. All Tour Model AS Series Technomads=stack together via interlocking ribs during transit, and like-size Tour Mod=I 
cabinets lock together. The Noho C can be used as a monitor by inserting t=o 7" lengths of stand-mount tubing into two 
1.5" sockets on the back of the=cabinet. The Noho C can be bracket-mounted with Omnimount 100 Series or All=n 
Products MM-022 brackets using the four 5/16-18 inserts on the back of th= cabinet. All hardware, including the grill is 
black, stainless steel to pr=vent corrosion and is recessed to prevent damage during shipment. From th= inside out, 
every part of every Technomad loudspeaker is designed to provi=e optimum performance in even the worst conditions. 
The PassiveProcessor'" option further expands the Noho.>=99s flexibility and ease of use in mobile applications. The 
PassiveProcesso='" is an internal four position EQ circuit which shifts the optimum l=stening distance farther away from 
the loudspeaker by increasing the high f=equency output of the unit. This allows a PassiveProcessor equipped Noho 
to=be used in both nearfield and longer-throw applications without requiring a=y external processing. 
Noho C loudspeake=s are used worldwide in applications ranging from concert sound systems to t=eaters to military PA 
to cruise ships to ballparks.
