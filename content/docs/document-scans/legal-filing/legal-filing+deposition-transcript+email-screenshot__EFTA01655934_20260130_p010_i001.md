executing a human-trafficking investigation at Cure Spa—legally registered as Luck Spa Inc. According to the article, 
the investigation details how the operation, initiated after online advertisements on adultsearch.com and 
skipthegames.com depicting nude women soliciting sex services, uncovered evidence that the facility was being 
used to profit from prostitution. According to a Lauderhill PD affidavit, law enforcement officers responded to Cure 
Spa and found Ye inside the business. An FBI-provided Chinese translator conducted an interview and confirmed 
that Ye owned and operated the establishment. Investigators determined that Ye paid a third party $500 per 
month to place ads offering commercial sex services, and that her photograph and alias "Lisa Baby" were used in 
text messages negotiating prices with clients. 
Police Considering Charges Against Sister of Missing Denton Woman Found Safe in Michigan 
CBS News (05/20, Myers) reported that authorities are considering charges against the sister of a 76-year-old North 
Texas woman who was found safe Tuesday morning in Michigan, more than a week after being taken without legal 
consent from an assisted living facility, according to the Denton Police Department. The article noted that Karen 
May Taube, the subject of a statewide Silver Alert, was located at a hotel in Houghton Lake, Michigan, with her 
sister, Eva Haron. Police say Haron allegedly removed Taube from Willow Bend Assisted Living & Memory Care on 
May 12 — violating a court order and taking her more than 1,000 miles away. Authorities said Taube is under 
guardianship that prohibits contact with Haron. The article mentioned that Taube was positively identified at the 
Michigan hotel by the Roscommon County Sheriff's Department. Investigators had previously believed the two 
were traveling in a white Ford F-150, though Taube was not considered in immediate danger. As a precaution, 
Taube was taken to a hospital for evaluation and is expected to return to Denton under her guardian's supervision, 
police said. The Dallas office of the FBI assisted in the search. 
Man Taken Into Custody At Buffalo Airport After Crashing Pickup Truck Into Gate 
The Associated Press (05/20, Staff Writer) reported that a man in a pickup truck drove through a roadside gate at 
the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and crossed a runway before being taken into custody Tuesday morning, 
according to police. According to the article, the unidentified man was apprehended at the western New York 
airport without incident about 6 minutes after breaching the gate, which was damaged. The incident, which 
occurred at about 7:30 a.m., did not disrupt air traffic, said Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority Police Chief 
Brian Patterson. It was not clear why the man breached the gate, but Patterson told reporters at a briefing that 
"we've come to the conclusion that this was intentional." The pickup truck crossed a taxiway and a runway before 
the man was taken into custody on an inactive runway outside a plane that is used for training, the chief said. The 
FBI was assisting with the investigation. ABC News (05/20, Video) also reported on the story. 
Utah Man Arrested In FBI Child Exploitation Sting 
KSL (05/20, Reavy) reported that an American Fork man was arrested Monday after police say he traveled to Lehi 
to meet up with a father he thought would allow him to sexually abuse his two young sons. But when George 
Washington Paulin III, 64, arrived at the designated meeting location, he was met by members of the FBI's Child 
Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force and was arrested. Starting in April, Paulin used an undisclosed app 
and "was communicating with someone who was believed to be the father of the 7- and 9-year-old boys," a police 
booking affidavit states. In reality, he was messaging an undercover agent. The article noted that Paulin also sent 
the undercover agent "numerous videos" of child sex abuse material, investigators say. The two agreed to meet 
Monday in Lehi so Paulin could abuse the two children, according to the affidavit. He was arrested shortly after 
arriving. Investigators learned after taking Paulin into custody that he had sexually abused an actual child in the 
past, the affidavit alleges. He was booked into the Utah County Jail for investigation of three counts of aggravated 
sexual exploitation of a minor, two counts of enticing a minor and two counts of sodomy on a child.
