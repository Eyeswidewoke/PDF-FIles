The share of Americans without health insurance has fallen more than 4 percentage points to 12.9 percent since 
Obamacare coverage began a year ago, according to a new Gallu= poll. This is a clear sign that one of Obamacare's 
primary mission is succeeding. In the fourth quarter of last year, 12.9 percent of Americans were uninsured, a steep 
drop from 17.1 percent a year before. The change w=s driven mainly by increased coverage through the AFFORDABLE 
CARE ACT's HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES a=d by the expansion of Medicaid access in more than half the country, the 
Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index shows, based on more than 43,000 intervi=ws conducted between Oct. 1 and Dec. 
30. 
Presi=ent Barack Obama and the congressional Democrats who enacted the Affordable Care Act had broader aims for 
the law than just cove=ing the uninsured, including providing stronger consumer protections for Health Insurance 
customers and curtailing unsustainable increases in national heal=h care spending. But extending coverage to uninsured 
people, especially those with low and moderate incomes eligible for Financial Assistance, is the mos= tangible effect of 
the law, and survey after survey shows its working.4>=A0 These gains are threatened, however, by the newly 
empowered Republican Congress and the Supreme Court. 
"The Affordable Care Act has accomplished one of it= goals: increasing the percentage of Americans who have HEALTH 
INSURANCE COVERAGE," the Gallup report says. "The uninsured rate a= measured by Gallup has dropped 4.2 points 
since the requirement to have health insuranc= or pay a fine went into effect. It will likely drop further as plans 
purchased during the current open enrollment period take effect." 
=p class="MsoNormal"> The second Obamacare sign-up period began Nov. 15 and ends Feb. 15. As of late December, 
6.4 mil=ion people had enrolled into private Health Insurance policies for 2015, about = million of whom were new to 
the Obamacare exchanges. The Department o= Health and Human Services estimates that more than 9 million people 
will be covered by private Obamac=re exchange plans by the end of the year. In addition, nearly 10 million more people 
are covered by Medicaid or the Children's HEALTH INSURANCE PROGR=M, two joint federal-state benefits for low-
income households, than were covered before Obamacare enrollment kicked off in October 2013. 
The new Gallup survey sh=ws declines in the uninsured rate for all segments of the working-age population, and the 
share of people ages 18=64 without coverage stood at 15.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. =The largest decrease 
was among people ages 18-25, a population that experienced a 6.1 percentage point drop in uninsur=nce since 2013 to 
17.4 percent. Almost all people 65 and older have coverage through Medicare. Low-income Americans and blacks also 
saw disproportionate declines in their uninsured rates, Gallup found. Still other surveys =ave shown the improvements 
in the uninsured rate to be geographically uneven due to the f=ct that a number of Southern states with higher-than-
average uninsured populations, rejected the Medicaid expansion, which the Supreme Court made optional for states in 
2012, leaving millions of low-income residents uninsured.
