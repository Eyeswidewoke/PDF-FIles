Information is an abstraction. Information is a measure of effect. Information is a concept that allows for relationships not 
previously possible. Effect deals with the construction of information from both incoming signals and bits of signals stored in 
the operant circuits of the brain. The incoming signals are transmitted by both internal and external receptors. aceEffect 
involves the total situation and not a single level of information movement.W.' There are no single levels of information 
movement. The total situation is the neural situation, the process of the nervous system. This system is operational. aceAll 
thataTms traceably happening is a shimmering array of pattern shifting occurring in a centerless, edgeless network. ItaTMs 
measurable piecemeal: trivial. The whole is immeasurable indeed except through effects.A9 Information is the measure of 
effect, the measure of the ordering of the brainaTMs activity in the transactional present. 
Communications theory is the study of messages. In this system, the message is nonlinear. The communication, the message, 
is pattern, order, neural inhibition. The message is the change in neural activity. It can be considered as a program, and a 
&grogram is nothing else but a set of commands: acedo this; do that . . .a which in other words means: aeedonaTMt do this; 
cloning do that . 
We are dealing with the transmission of neural pattern from ficea brain and its outputs, through a 
specifiable set of processes to the external world, through a portion of that world with specifiable modes, media and artificial 
means to another body, another brain.fin We are dealing with a set of relationships which allows us to conceptualize the 
communication of neural experience. The difference between human experience and neural experience is the difference 
between illusion and reality, between choice and no choice. 
In talking about the state of consciousness, do not deal in there-and-then considerations of interpretation of the ordering and 
arrangement of the direct experience of the brain. The ordering and arrangement are a continual functional happening. The 
ordering and arrangement are all that is actually happening. Nothing else ever happens. The ordering and arrangement are to 
be measured in terms of information. 
The most significant, the most critical, inventions of man were not those ever considered to be inventions but those which 
appeared to be innate and natural. Man never understood to what degree all of nature was man-made. One such major and 
crucial invention was talking. Talking was probably manaTMs most important invention. It was, undoubtedly, considered to be 
innate and natural until a man, making a new observation, exclaimed, aceWeamire tallcing.au At that point no one had ever 
heard of such a thing. Still, talking was an invention that changed the way the brain worked. Talking, a man-made invention, 
provided information modifying the operation of the brain without any awareness. There was no choice. For thousands of 
years man was molding himself in a certain manner, but the pattern was not invented until a man said, aceWeaTmre talking.fi 
Man is dead. Credit his death to an invention. The invention was the grasping of a conceptual whole, a set of relationships 
which had not been previously recognized. The invention was man-made. It was the recognition that reality was 
communicable. The process was the transmission of neural pattern. Such patterns are electrical not mental. The system of 
communication and control functioned without individual awareness or consent. The message in the system was not words, 
ideas, images, etc. The message was nonlinear: operant neural pattern. It became clear that acenew concepts of 
communication and control involved a new interpretation of man, of manaTMs knowledge of the universe, and of society.au 
Man is dead. ficeWeaTmre talking"' 
The system can be comprehended only by killing off man. We are not destroying a phenomenon. We are replacing one system 
of abstraction with another system of abstraction. Man was nothing but a model, a technique. It is now necessary to construct 
a new model, to invoke a new system of abstraction, no more truthful than the old one, no closer to any ultimate answer. An 
abstraction is only an abstraction. The insanity of man is that he believed in his humanity as the very basis of reality, as the 
ultimate end to evolution. But keit is of the utmost importance to be vigilant in critically revising modes of abstraction. It is 
here that philosophy finds its niche as essential to the healthy progress of society. It is the critic of abstractions. A civilization
