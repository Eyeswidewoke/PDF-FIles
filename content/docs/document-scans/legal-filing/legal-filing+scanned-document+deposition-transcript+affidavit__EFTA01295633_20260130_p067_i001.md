785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ";

Wal-Mart demonstrates these concepts well. There, the plaintiffs offered statistics 
purporting to show regional and national disparities in employment decisions at Wal-Mart. 
Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2555. Those decisions, however, were made at the store level. Id. 
at 2547. Because of that disconnect, the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs' statistics did 
not establish a common policy. Once again, the broader disparities might have been 
"attributable only to a small set of Wal-Mart stores" and did not "establish the uniform, 
store-by-store disparity upon which plaintiffs' theory of commonality depend[ed]." Id. at 
2555. In essence, Wal-Mart agreed with our own, earlier cases indicating that statistics 
should not be aggregated together to create disparities that are not actually representative 
of ("121] the class as a whole. Compare Stastny, 628 F.2d 279-80 (requiring the 
plaintiffs' statistics to focus on the "locus of autonomy"), with Elizabeth Tippett, Robbing a 
Barren Vault: The Implications of Dukes v. Wal-Mart for Cases Challenging Subjective 
Employment Practices, 29 Hofstra Lab. & Emp. L.J. 433, 447 (2012), cited with approval 
by Scott v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 733 F.3d 105, 113 (4th Cir. 2013) (explaining that 
Wal-Mart requires that plaintiffs' statistics focus on "the locus of the subjective decision-
making"). 
In requiring the plaintiffs' statistics to be centered at the level of relevant decisionmaking, 
Wal-Mart did not distinguish between nationwide and other class actions. Rather, Wal-Mart 
asked whether the plaintiffs there were too dissimilar to bring their claims together, 
regardless of how many claims there might be. Thus, courts have applied principles from 
Wal-Mart in cases involving classes of roughly the same size as the class at issue here. 
See, e.g., Wang v. Chinese Daily News, Inc., 737 F.3d 538, 544 (9th Cir. 2013) (200 class 
members); Ealy, 514 F. App'x at 304-08 (150 class members). Even statisticians agree 
that Wal-Mart reaches classes big and small. See, e.g., Dr. Mary Dunn Baker, Class 
Certification Statistical Analysis Post-Dukes, 27 ABA J. Lab. & Empl. L. 471, 479 (2012) 
("[T]he size of the putative class or the number of establishments the defendant operates 
will have little to ("122] do with whether the Dukes commonality approach is applicable."). 
So, even though Plaintiffs here challenge practices in one plant, they still must offer 
statistics showing disparities among all the relevant decisionmakers, regardless of that 
one-plant focus. See Rubenstein, supra, § 24:40 ("Courts have certified [only] limited 
classes when the facts show that no uniform personnel policies are applied ("944] among 
the various plants, departments, or levels of employees."). 
b. 
Here, as the Brown I majority agreed, the evidence indicates "that each department 
manager" in each of Nucor's six production departments "has unbridled discretion to make 
promotions within his department utilizing whatever objective or subjective factors he 
wishes." Brown I, 576 F.3d at 151. Department managers took full advantage of that 
discretion, developing processes that they recurrently characterized as unique and 
independent. See J.A. 7887, 7894-95, 7900, 7906-07. Indeed, these processes were so 
varied that one supervisor declared that he had "no idea what other departments d[id]." 
J.A. 8109. Even the decisionmakers varied. In some departments, such as the hot mill and 
shipping departments, supervisors and the department managers made promotion 
decisions. In other ("123] departments, such as maintenance and the cold mill, 
promotions decisions were a more collaborative effort involving even lower-level lead men.
