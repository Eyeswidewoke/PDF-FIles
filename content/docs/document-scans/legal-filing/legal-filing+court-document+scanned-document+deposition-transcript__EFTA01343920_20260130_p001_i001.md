Americas Region Reputational Risk Committee Policy 
Section 1: Scope and Responsibility 
Deutsche Bank 
The Americas Region supports business practices that comply with the Group Reputational Risk 
Management Program, as outlined in the DB Group Reputational Risk Management Program Policy 
dated May 9, 2011. 
Within the Americas region, consideration of all reputational risk issues is the responsibility of the 
Americas Regional Governance Board (RGB). The RGB has delegated such consideration to the 
Americas Reputational Risk Committee (ARRC), a permanent sub-committee of the RGB. 
The governance requirements described in this remit are applicable to all businesses, infrastructure 
groups and employees in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Cayman Islands. 
1.1 Mission 
The ARRC functions as the senior regional approval and oversight committee in North America for 
reputational risk. The ARRC is responsible for the development of a regional reputational risk appetite, 
setting standards for ARRC review, providing guidelines and criteria for escalation, and providing 
guidance to assist the Business Divisions in identifying reputational risk issues for escalation. The 
ARRC provides oversight of the regional reputational risk appetite. 
1.2 Tasks and Responsibilities of the ARRC 
The ARRC is responsible for reviewing, assessing, and opining on all reputational risk issues brought to 
the ARRC by businesses or Control & Support functions. Resolution of an issue means that the 
Committee may approve, approve with conditions, defer or reject any proposal presented. 
The ARRC 
is also responsible for escalating issues that cannot or should not be decided within the region (See 
Section 8). The ARRC has a responsibility to report all actions taken within the region through the RRN 
(Reputational Risk Network) for further aggregation on a global level. Lastly, the ARRC sets and 
monitors the regional risk appetite for reputational risk. 
The ARRC escalates unresolved issues first to the RGB and then if necessary to the North America 
Executive Committee regionally, and to the Group Reputational Risk Committee globally. 
Within the Americas region, all transacting businesses and/or reviewing Control & Support functions, are 
required to bring to the ARRC for review any transactions that give rise to a new reputational risk or 
increase an existing risk. Reputational risk, as defined in Group Policy, is: 
"...The threat that publicity concerning a transaction, counterparty or business practice involving a 
client will negatively impact the public's trust in DB...' 
Such risk can be found when adopting a client, undertaking a transaction, pursuing a particular business 
activity or proposition, or even in associating DB's name with that of a particular client, company or 
industry. 
A Reputational Risk Analysis Desk Guide (see Appendix 1) has been developed by Compliance and 
Legal to assist businesses and control functions in reviewing the reputational risk aspects of a 
transaction or other venture, so that the decision to escalate to the ARRC for review can be made in an 
informed manner. This appendix contains the criteria the business should evaluate when identifying 
reputational risk issues to be escalated to the ARRC. 
1.3 Responsibilities of Business and Support 
Primary responsibility for the identification, escalation and resolution of reputational risk issues 
resides with the businesses. The role of Control Groups is to assist and advise the businesses in 
ascertaining that such issues have been appropriately identified, escalated and addressed to
