heres what this s=ys. i lawrence krauss will tell you how i thinkyou should=conduct your investigation 
, if at all. and I would like t= participate in it. repsonse. go fuck yourself.&nbs=; we will not share the file , all 
complaints are proteced from=defamation and you must continue to cooperate. 
I wanted to add to his letter, to reiterate our concern about how your office was planning to follow up 
on the false and defamatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because this was initiated by an onl=ne 
entertainment news outlet with a clear agenda and established record of propagating false allegations about me, rather 
than by any of the individuals they refer to as sources, this should not b= considered a credible allegation worthy of 
investigation. I belie=e that our initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. Whether o= not you agree with 
this, there are two thin=s I think are important to establish. =/div> 
First=y, that the University should not propagate what can be false allegations from such a source by 
presenting them directly to current and/or former employees or to others. To do so would be to further their libelous 
=agenda, as Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard,=I would appreciate seeing copies of the correspondence you 
might send to curr=nt or former employees about this in the process of carrying out and concluding your investigation. 
your client, La=rence Krauss, copied me on his February 23rd email communication to the Office of 
Equity and Inclusion. I am writing to =convey the University's position on its responsibility to conduct =administrative 
investigations into allegations of conduct that would violate institutional policy, if true. Because Dr. Krauss has retained 
legal counsel, I am writing directly to you. You may forward my=20 communication on to your client. Without having 
first secured your permission, I did not think it was proper for me to copying him o= this reply. 
Our policy on th= Prohibition Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation (ACD 401

p0p1YIFvVS5vuv1LTTTDP94Oi4bm0&s==Gloe_z-tNcRUFiYCSoJmaBJXtQK1_SFbRg2AhDIdKs&e=> ) and its accompanying 
procedures (P20 — link to the procedures is =embedded in the policy document) directs the Office of Equity and Inclusion 
to conduct prompt and equitable investigations. Among the =points stated are that the Office accepts anonymous 
complai=ts as well as direct complaints. University employees are required to cooperate =with any investigation or 
allegations of violations of this policy. =Providing false or misleading information or failing to cooperate may result in 
disciplinary action. Individuals making a complaint or participating as a witness in an investigation cannot be retaliated 
against. Any employee who engages in retaliation will be disciplined.&=bsp; The Office of Equity and Inclusion does not 
make any findings until such time as it determines that it has completed its fact gathering. 
=/div> 
Our courts recognize that participants in an administrative investigation have a privilege ag=inst a 
defamation charge. In Paros v. Hoema=o Hospital, 140 Ariz. 335, 681 P.2d 918 (Ct. App. Div. 2 1984), the court 
recognized that the employer's response to a notice of charge of discrimination=20 filed with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission was absolutely privileged. In Miller v. Servicemaster by Ree=, 174 Ariz. at 520, 851 P.2d 240, 
243 (Ct. App. Div. 1 1993), the court recognized the existence of a conditional privilege for employees to report 
perceived acts of sexual harassment as public policy dictated that employees must be protected from workplace sexual 
harassment. Cited approvingly, Carey v. Maricopa County, 
The Office of Equity and Inclusion will proceed with its investigation as outlined in ACD 401 and P20. The 
Office will not provide yo=r client with its investigative file. We look forward to Dr. Krauss =99s continuing cooperation.
