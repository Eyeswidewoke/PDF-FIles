Plaintiff under the STEM agreements is $4,625,117.52, plus interest. (Id., ¶ 30.) 
D. Warehouse Receipt and status of fuel-based product serving as collateral. 
The Plaintiff alleges that, on April 8, 2013, Bunkering, BTU and Brito "issued a 'Warehouse 
Receipt' to [the Plaintiff] to lead [the Plaintiff] to believe that [the Plaintiff] had and 
maintained a right to possess riot the product at issue as security for the debt evidenced 
by the invoices." (Id., ¶ 49.) Additionally, three days later, BIC represented to the Plaintiff 
that the Plaintiffs transactions with Specialty were secured by fuel oil. (Id., ¶ 57(k)-(0.) 
The Plaintiff alleges that the Warehouse Receipt was false and misleading and that the 
Plaintiffs accounts were not, in fact, secured by fuel-based product. (Id., 7149, 57(1), 61.)•

transactions at issue and failed to disclose the true status of that collateral. (Id., ¶¶ 64, 74.)

collateral. (Doc. 64,1 13.) The Plaintiffs inconsistent pleading is permissible. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(d); Ocean's 11 Bard Grill,

was deteriorating, (id., ¶ ['i2] 27). "On April 29, 2013, Brito filed a Motion for Judicial
