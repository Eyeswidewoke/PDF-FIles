encouraged pension funds to diversify their risk so that their portfolios were no longer dominated by equities. At 
the same time a long period of low interest rates and occasional mild recessions helped fuel the growth of hedge 
funds and private equity, which rely on the use of borrowed money to enhance their returns. 
The advent of these new investors may have been responsible for some wild swings in credit spreads (the excess 
yields paid by companies to reflect the risk of default). At the height of the credit boom in 2006 spreads had fallen 
to historic lows. Jay Ritter of the University of Florida says the market sometimes underestimates the default risk 
on junk bonds. Investors tend to look at recent default rates, which may be misleading. A boom in junk-bond 
issuance leaves companies with large pools of cash. It takes them a few years to drain these pools and get into 
trouble. 
By pushing down spreads, investors reduced the cost of capital and encouraged companies to take on more debt. 
At the same time the desire for high credit ratings was going out of fashion. Managements that hoarded cash 
were told to return it to shareholders so it could be invested elsewhere rather than being frittered away on value-
destroying acquisitions. 
Standard corporate finance theory, first expounded by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, states that whether a 
firm is financed by debt or equity should make no difference to its value; the cashflow is simply parcelled out in 
different ways. But the theory leaves out the tax treatment of different kinds of finance. In most countries 
interest payments are tax-deductible but dividend payments are not. The tax system may have encouraged 
companies to take on debt, although Mr Ritter says studies have found little relationship between corporate tax 
rates and debt. 
A stronger motive for borrowing more may have been executive pay. Most incentive payments these days come in 
the form of share options, which if the share price rises rapidly can soon turn executives into multimillionaires. 
The strongest driver of a company's share price, in the short term, is the ability to meet quarterly targets for 
earnings per share. And using spare cash to buy back a company's equity tends to increase earnings per share. 
Managers should have been deterred from taking on too much debt because a leveraged balance-sheet is more 
risky, but that did not seem to worry them. Chief executives these days come and go almost as quickly as 
managers of football clubs. A high-risk strategy may pay off in the short term; higher debt levels may sink the 
company only in the longer term, after the executive has left. Moreover, the value of the option is related to the 
volatility of the underlying share price; a riskier strategy makes that price more volatile and thus increases the 
executive's putative wealth. Even if the option expires unexercised, the executive is no worse off. 
However, the increased use of debt across the corporate sector has not been uniform. American companies 
learned some lessons in 2000-02 when the bursting of the dotcom bubble brought down giants such as Enron and 
WorldCom. Quoted companies were more cautious about taking on debt in subsequent years. A report by the 
McKinsey Global Institute found that the non-financial business sector in most countries entered the recent crisis 
with lower leverage (measured as the ratio of debt over book equity) than they had at the start of the decade. 
Instead debt was more concentrated, particularly on those companies that had been acquired by private-equity 
firms in leveraged buy-outs (LBOs). In some ways private equity is a creature of the "great moderation" from the 
mid-1980s to the mid-2000s. Private equity needs willing investors, access to credit, steady economic growth (so 
that the debt can be repaid) and rising asset markets (so that acquired companies can be sold again). 
But conditions are now less favourable. Economic growth may be sluggish as economies work off their debt, and 
floating companies on the stockmarket may be harder. Among the biggest debt investors were the managers of 
structured products called collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), but since the credit crunch the market has dried 
up. And the debts accumulated in the 2006-07 boom have to be refinanced. Moody's reckons that some €250 
billion of LBO debt will need to be rolled over in the next five years. 
Private-equity loans were just one of many assets (for example, mortgage, car and credit-card debts) that were 
bundled together and repackaged into instruments bought by investors who themselves were using borrowed 
money (banks, hedge funds and specialist vehicles like conduits). Such investors were taking advantage of the
