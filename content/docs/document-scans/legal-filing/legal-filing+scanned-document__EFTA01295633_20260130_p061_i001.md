calculated an expected black promotion rate and compared it to the "actual" black 
promotion rate for the same period. Tied with the actual promotions figures from 2001 
through 2003, Plaintiffs' extrapolated figures produced the number on which the majority 
now relies — 2.54 standard deviations. 
b. 
Plaintiffs' experts, however, based their extrapolations on several erroneous assumptions 
that render their model unreliable. 
It begins with the change-of-status forms, [" 105] which Nucor used to record any change 
of employee status. Because the forms also recorded demotions, pay increases, 
reassignments, and transfers, one cannot and should not assume that every form reflects 
a posted promotion. But up to the time that the district court decertified the promotions 
classes, Plaintiffs had never provided the 27 relevant change-of-status forms to the district 
court. Quite understandably, the district court wanted more concrete assurance that 
Plaintiffs' selected forms showed actual promotions. The district court never got that 
assurance, and it was "not inclined" to "take [Plaintiffs'] word for it." J.A. 10943. Plaintiffs 
did eventually submit the 27 relevant change- of-status forms — but only after the district 
court decertified the promotions classes. As it turns out, those forms do little to dispel the 
concern that Plaintiffs misidentified promotions. For example, two forms seem to show 
transfers, not promotions, J.A. 11006 (Reynolds), 11028 (Forsell), while another just 
reflects training, J.A. 11029 (Green). Others do not involve pay raises, suggesting no 
promotion occurred. See J.A. 11006 (Haselden), 11030 (Cooper). Certain other forms are 
ambiguous, ["106] failing to indicate whether pay rates changed or what the nature of the 
position change was. See, e.g., J.A. 11022 (Anderson), 11024 (Proskine), 11025 (Pope). 
Most of the forms fail p938] to indicate whether Nucor posted the relevant opening for 
bidding. See, e.g., J.A. 11006-15, 11019-21, 11023, 11026-32. So, the district court was 
reasonably concerned that the 27 purported promotions — representing nearly half of the 
promotions in Plaintiffs' statistical analysis -- were suspect and statistically useless. 
The problems with Plaintiffs' experts' model continue to mount when the hypothesized 
bidding pools for the purported promotions are examined. Plaintiffs' experts hypothesized 
that at least one black employee bid on each of the 27 assumed promotion opportunities. 
But that approach rejects the prospect of an all-white bidding pool during the projected 
period, something likely to randomly happen from time to time given Nucor's 11% black 
workforce. Consequently, Nucor's expert concluded that Plaintiffs' experts' model 
"overstat[ed] the expected number of African American selections" between December 
1999 and January 2001, as the model very likely inflated the number of black bidders. J.A. 
5912. And indeed, ["107] Plaintiffs' experts calculated that black workers applied to jobs 
at a substantially higher pace than their actual percentage of the workforce, further 
suggesting some degree of inflation. Compare J.A. 1157 (noting that workforce was 
"11.3% African-American"), with J.A. 1162 ("The racial composition of the bidders . . was 
19.24% African-American."). 
An "inflated pool" like the one that Plaintiffs used "can undermine the validity of a statistical 
study to determine imbalances." Smith v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 84 F.3d 672, 677 (4th 
Cir. 1996) . When a statistical model overestimates the number of black bidders, for
