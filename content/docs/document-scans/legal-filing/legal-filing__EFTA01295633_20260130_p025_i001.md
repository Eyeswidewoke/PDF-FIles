785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl, Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
the class independently met the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). The reconsideration of 
those determinations was not compelled by Wal-Mart and contravened our mandate in 
Brown I. 
3 Furthermore, this Court's original mandate did not entirely divest the district court of its ongoing authority under Rule 
23(c)(1)(C) to monitor the class and make changes when appropriate. See Prado-Steiman v. Bush, 221 F.3d 1266, 1273 (11th 
Or. 2000) ( (FIN4) 'Class certification orders . . . are not final judgments impervious to lower court review and revision"); Gene 
& Gene, L.LC. v. BioPay. L.L.C., 624 F.3d 698, 702-03 (5th Or. 2010). 
Because the district court could reexamine ("13] whether the workers met the 
requirement of commonality, we review those findings under the abuse of discretion 
standard that typically applies to certification orders. See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 
521 U.S. 591, 630, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997) ( [HN5]"The law gives 
broad leeway to district courts in making class certification decisions, and their judgments 
are to be reviewed by the court of appeals only for abuse of discretion."); Brown I, 576 
F.3d at 152; Thorn v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., 445 F.3d 311, 317 (4th Cir. 2006). A 
district court abuses its discretion when it materially misapplies the requirements of Rule 
23. See Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 424 (4th Cir. 2003); Thorn, 445 
F.3d at 317-18 ("A district court per se abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law 
or clearly errs in its factual findings."). The decisive question here is whether the district 
court materially misapplied Rule 23(a)(2) to the facts at hand in light of Wal-Mart.' 
4 The dissent is skeptical that an appellate court can articulate a deferential standard of review while then finding reversible 
error in many of the factual and legal determinations made by a district court. See post at 84. Deference, however, clearly does 
not excuse us from conducting a detailed review of the record. Nor does it blind us from factual findings that were not supported 
and legal determinations that represent a fundamental misunderstanding of Wal•Mart's scope. Indeed. we recently I"14] 
applied similar scrutiny when overturning a district court's class certification order. See EOT Production. 764 F.3d at 357.58. 
Ill. 
[FIN6] Rule 23(a)(2) establishes that a class action may be maintained only if "there are 
questions of law or fact common to the class." The district court determined that Wal-Mart 
required decertification of the workers' promotions class insofar as the Supreme Court's 
interpretation of the rule (1) emphasized the analytical rigor required to evaluate a 
plaintiffs statistical evidence of commonality at the class certification stage, (2) placed the 
burden on plaintiffs to provide "significant proof' of a "general policy of discrimination" and 
"common injury," and (3) relatedly established that a company's policy of discretionary 
decision-making cannot sustain class certification without a showing that supervisors 
exercised their discretion in a common way. 
Each of these arguments is considered in turn. 
r9O3] A. 
(HN7] Wal-Mart reaffirmed existing precedent that courts must rigorously examine 
whether plaintiffs have met the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) at the certification stage, an 
analysis that will often overlap with the merits of a claim. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551
