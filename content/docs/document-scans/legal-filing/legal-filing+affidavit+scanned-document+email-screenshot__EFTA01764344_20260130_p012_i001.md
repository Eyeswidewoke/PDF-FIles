Someone who knows h=w to brief and be briefed. Both things require terseness. Those who feel t=e tendency to give 
speeches at small, time-constrained meetings and who al=ays have the psychological need to get in the last word are apt 
to be less successful in government, which, a=ter all, is about social skills at meetings. Successful officials get to t=e point 
quickly and efficiently extract knowledge from others by asking pe=etrating questions. 
Someone who knows h=w to be a realist while talking like an idealist <http://us4.account-

Fweekly%2Fegypt-and-idealist-realist-debate-us-foreign-policy&ur=_id=202349&tags=5,33> . Idealism provides a state 
with an identity, even as a state requi=es realism to survive. 
Someone who does no= need -- for monetary or psychological reasons -- to publish often. Great =ublic servants like 
former Secretary of State James Baker and former Secre=ary of Defense Robert Gates were never known for brilliant 
pieces in the newspapers and journals of opinion. Thei= genius was the process of decision-making itself. And that is the 
essence=of government. 
In short, the real =oreign policy professionals are people who are all about discipline: disci=line in what they say, in how 
they think, in how they administer and in th= discipline of maintaining a thick hide against public criticism. Obviously, 
discipline is not all that is re=uired -- just look at Rumsfeld, an intensely disciplined man -- but, never=heless, discipline is 
the basis for good judgment and a good management st=le. Remember, America is a vast country that requires a 
massive security and diplomatic bureaucracy. Turni=g that bureaucracy in the direction you want it to go, and making it 
all w=rk toward repeated, successful outcomes is more an art than a science. 
But that art is mor= likely to come from some professional fields more than others. Baker was = high-powered lawyer, 
Gates spent a life in the intelligence bureaucracy a=d Shultz ran a large engineering firm. While Kissinger and Brzezinski 
were academics, they also came from World W=r II European immigrant backgrounds, which gave them an emotional 
and inte=lectual depth relatively rare on today's university campuses. 
Ideas matter: An ad=inistration without ideas will drift from one tactical fix to another with=no overall direction. But 
ideas need not always be articulated in print. G=orge H. W. Bush's administration, in which Baker served, was about the 
sensibility of managing the Cold War to = peaceful conclusion advantageous to the United States, even as none of th= 
top-tier men had ever published much of note. Keep that in mind when judg=ng the next administration's foreign policy 
officials. 
Unfortunately, it i= sometimes hard for the public to scrutinize appointees to top- and upper-=iddle level positions. The 
media are not always aware of their personal tr=its, for the traits that really matter are often known to a relative small 
number of people. Meanwhile, congressi=nal hearings on appointees are often a game of gotcha, in which mistakes o=er 
a long career are exposed for the sake of mere embarrassment or to disq=alify someone who runs ideologically afoul of 
some members of the committee. 
The best advice I c=n offer the public in this regard is to try to find out what the colleague= of the appointees themselves 
have to say about them. In addition, as I sa=d at the beginning, look for people who have a resume of actually running 
things.
