the private placement warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may 
have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our 
operations and profitability. 
The net proceeds from this offering and the private placement of warrants will provide us with approximately 
SI30,950,0W (or approximately 5150,592,500 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) that 
we may use to complete our business combination (excluding up to $4,050,000 or up to approximately 
$4,657,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, of deferred underwriting commissions being held in 
the trust account). 
We may effectuate our business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses 
simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our business 
combination with more than one target business because of various factors. including the existence of complex 
accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma fmancial statements with the SEC that 
present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a 
combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity our lack of 
diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. Further. we would not be 
able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other 
entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or 
different areas of a single industry. Accordingly. the prospects for our success may be: 
• solely dependent upon the performance of a single business. property or mot, or 
• dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products. processes 
or services. 
This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. any or all 
of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent 
to our business combination. 
We may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, 
which may hinder our ability to complete our business combination and give rise to increased costs and 
risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability. 
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need 
for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the 
other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our 
initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including 
additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if 
there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and 
services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we arc unable to adequately 
address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.

We may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little 
information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as 
profitable as we suspected, if at all. 
In pursuing our acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a 
privately held company. By definition. very little public information exists about private companies. and we could 
be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of 
limited infonnation, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we 
suspected, if at all. 
Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business 
combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management 
ve ill possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. 
We may structure a business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public 
stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will 
only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the 
outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us 
not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider 
any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the 
voting securities of the target. our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority 
interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the 
business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial 
number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this
