In Syria's war, the line= that matter aren't red 
Fouad Ajami 
May 9 -- It is rarely a go=d idea to draw maps in a hurry. But that is what colonial cartographers di= in the Arab world 
after the First World War, and the borders they painted were superimposed on old tribal and religious=attachments that 
long predated the new states. 
Today, the folly of those lines is ma=e clear, as Syria's war <http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/reported-israeli-
airs=rikes-threats-of-retaliation-complicate-syrian-civil-war/2013/05/06/4e8217=6-b67b-11e2-92f3-
1291801936b8_story.html?tid=pm_world_pop> threatens not just its territorial unity but that of its neighbors as we=l. 
Alas, it was perhaps optimistic to ev=r imagine that the fighting between Syria's Alawite regime and the Sunni=led 
rebellion would remain within the country's borders. Syria is at once the pivot and a mirror of the Fertile Crescent, =nd 
its sectarian and ethnic fissures reproduce themselves in neighboring A=ab states. As an oddly passive President Obama 
ponders what he might do in Syria <http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/on-=yria-recent-
developments-favor-case-for-stepped-up-us-military-aid/2013/05=06/b0089cce-b682-11e2-b94c-
b684dda07add_story.html> — and whether to do anything at all — he should b= less preoccupied with red lines of his 
own making than with the blurring 4 the lines drawn in Arab sands decades ago. 
On the map, Tripoli, on the Med=terranean Sea, lies within the borders of Lebanon and is the country's s=cond-largest 
city. But Tripoli, staunchly Sunni, with an Alawite minority, has always been within the orbit of the S=rian city of Horns. 
So it is no mystery that a deadly conflict now rages in=Tripoli between Sunni and Alawite neighborhoods, rendering the 
place ungov=rnable. Sunni jihadists and preachers see the Syrian struggle as their own, an opportunity to evict the 
Alawites=from their midst and to restore Sunni primacy. 
Look to Iraq, on Syria's eastern bo=der, for the region's quintessential artificial entity. Today, the gover=ment in 
Baghdad, Shiite-led for the first time in a millennium, sides with the Alawite dictatorship 
<http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013=03-24/world/37989851_1maliki-iranian-flights-state-john-f-kerry> in 
Damascus. But in western Iraq, the Sunni strongholds of Anba= province and Mosul have been stirred up by the Syrian 
rebellion. The same=tribes straddle the border between the two countries. Smugglers and traders, and now Sunni 
warriors, pay that=border no heed. 
The American war upended the or=er of things in Iraq; the Sunni minority lost out to the Shiites and brist=ed under that 
change of fortunes. The Syrian rebellion, a Sunni upheaval against an Alawite minority, has been a boon t= the Sunnis of 
Iraq. The Sunnis have bottomless grievances against the gov=rnment of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. To them, Maliki, 
who spent a qua=ter-century exiled in Syria and Iran, is an agent of the Iranian theocracy. So even though the regime in 
S=ria did its best to subvert the new order in Baghdad — between 2003 and =009, Syria was the transit point for 
jihadists converging on Iraq to fight=the Americans and the Shiites — the Maliki government, with oil money, and 
anchored in the power of the (Shiit=) Dawa party, is throwing a lifeline to the Syrian dictator.=/span> 
The Shiite appetite in Iraq has grown=with the eating. Anti-terrorism laws and the provisions of de-Baathificati=n have 
been unleashed on the Sunnis, and the forces of order have become instruments of the Maliki government. Thou=ands 
languish in prison on spurious charges, and protests <http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-0S-
03/world/38994=22_1_security-forces-sunni-protest-site-civil-war> have broken out in Sunni cities. The Syrian conflict 
has added fuel to the=fire. If the Sunnis needed proof that the Shiite coalition in the region (=omprising Iran, the Iraqi 
state, the Alawite regime in Damascus and Hezbol=ah in Lebanon) is hell-bent on robbing them of their historic place in 
Iraq, their government's tilt to=ard Bashar al-Assad provided it.
