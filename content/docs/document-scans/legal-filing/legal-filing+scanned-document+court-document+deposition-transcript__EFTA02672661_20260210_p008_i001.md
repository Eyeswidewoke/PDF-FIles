Whitfield took the remaining Temptations quartet and re-recorded "It's Summer", the B-side to "Ball of 
Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)", as a replacement single. "Smiling Faces Sometimes" was 
released as a single for The Undisputed Truth instead, becoming a Top 5 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 
1971. Meanwhile, "It's Summer" peaked at #51 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the first Temptations 
single to miss the Top 40 since "Farewell My Love" eight years earlier. 
After his doctor declared a few weeks later that he was unable to continue performing due to medical 
reasons, Paul Williams quit the Temptations in May. Richard Street officially took Williams' place, 
although Williams continued to be paid his customary one-fifth of group revenue (Street was paid on 
salary for the first eighteen months of his tenure►, and worked when he could with the group as an 
adviser and choreographer. After Williams had recovered enough to record again, he recorded two sides 
in 1973 for a debut solo single. However, on August 17, 1973, Williams died in Detroit at the age of 34, 
his death ruled a suicide by the Wayne County coroner. 
The Temptations in the early 1970s 
The addition of Dennis Edwards to the Temptations coincided with the adoption of a new sound for the 
group by producer Norman Whitfield, and in the fall of 1968, Whitfield began producing psychedelic-
based material for the Temptations, derived primarily from the sound of funk band Sly & the Family 
Stone. This new style, which debuted with the Top 10 hit single "Cloud Nine"[14] in October 1968, was a 
marked departure from the David Ruffin-era ballads. The instrumentation was funkier, the beat was 
hard-driving, and all five Temptations traded lead vocals, similar to Sly & the Family Stone. "Cloud Nine", 
the centerpiece of the group's landmark Cloud Nine LP, was a Top 10 hit and won Motown its first 
Grammy Award, for Best R&B Vocal Group Performance of 1969. 
The blending of the Motown sound and psychedelic rock sound resulted in a new subgenre of music 
called "psychedelic soul", also evident in the work of Diana Ross and the Supremes ("Reflections", "Love 
Child"), Marvin Gaye's version of "I Heard It Through the Grapevine", and the music of The Sth 
Dimension, The Undisputed Truth, and The Friends of Distinction. More Temptations psychedelic soul 
singles would follow in 1969 and 1970, among them "Runaway Child, Running Wild" (a number-one R&B 
hit), "I Can't Get Next to You" (a number-one pop hit), "Psychedelic Shack", and "Ball of Confusion (That's 
What the World Is Today)", but the formula began to wear thin when "Ungena Za Ulimwengu (Unite the 
World)", only went to #33 Pop in the fall of 1970. The group's other important albums from this period 
included Puzzle People (1969) and Psychedelic Shack (1970). Psychedelic Shack includes the original 
version of "War", later made famous by Edwin Starr. 
Exit Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams 
Paul Williams, who suffered from sickle-cell disease, fell into depression because of the stress of touring 
and personal issues. By the late 1960s, he had developed a serious case of alcoholism.[21) As his physical 
and mental health began to decline sharply, it made performing increasingly difficult. Williams began 
traveling with oxygen tanks, and the other four Temptations made valiant efforts to raid and drain his 
alcohol stashes.
