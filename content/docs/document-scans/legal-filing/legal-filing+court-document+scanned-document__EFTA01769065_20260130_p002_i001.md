of visitors, a brawny man in his 40s with his eyes hidden behind a pa=r of Ray-Ban sunglasses, bounces down the steps. 
When he reaches the lower deck, he turns around and says: =quot;Welcome on board the Tekumah. Welcome to my 
toy." 
He pushes back a bo=t and opens the refrigerator, revealing zucchini, a pallet of yoghurt cups=and a two-liter bottle of 
low-calorie cola. The Tekumah has just returned =rom a secret mission in the early morning hours. 
The navy officer, w=ose name the military censorship office wants to keep secret, leads the vi=itors past a pair of bunks 
and along a steel frame. The air smells stale, =ot unlike the air in the living room of an apartment occupied solely by 
men. At the middle of the ship, the cor=idor widens and merges into a command center, with work stations grouped 
a=ound a periscope. The officer stands still and points to a row of monitors= with signs bearing the names of German 
electronics giant Siemens and Atlas, a Bremen-based electronics com=any, screwed to the wall next to them. 
The "Combat In=ormation Center," as the Israelis call the command center, is the hea=t of the submarine, the place 
where all information comes together and all=the operations are led. The ship is controlled from two leather chairs. It 
looks as if it could be in the cockpit of a sm=ll aircraft. A display lit up in red shows that the vessel's keel is curre=tly 
located 7.15 meters (23.45 feet) below sea level. 
"This was all =uilt in Germany, according to Israeli specifications," the navy offic=r says, "and so were the weapons 
systems." The Tekuma, 57 meter= long and 7 meters wide, is a showpiece of precision engineering, painted in blue and 
made in Germany. To be more precise, it i= a piece of precision engineering made in Germany that is suitable for 
equ=pping with nuclear weapons. 
No Room for Doubt <=span> 
Deep in their inter=ors, on decks 2 and 3, the submarines contain a secret that even in Israel=is only known to a few 
insiders: nuclear warheads, small enough to be moun=ed on a cruise missile, but explosive enough to execute a nuclear 
strike that would cause devastating results. T=is secret is considered one of the best kept in modern military history. 
A=yone who speaks openly about it in Israel runs the risk of being sentenced=to a lengthy prison term. 
Research SPIEGEL ha= conducted in Germany, Israel and the United States, among current and pas= government 
ministers, military officials, defense engineers and intellige=ce agents, no longer leaves any room for doubt: With the 
help of German maritime technology, Israel has managed-to create for itself a floating nuclear weapon arsenal: 
submarines equippe= with nuclear capability. 
Foreign journalists=have never boarded one of the combat vessels before. In an unaccustomed di=play of openness, 
senior politicians and military officials with the Jew's= state were, however, now willing to talk about the importance of 
German-Israeli military cooperation and Germa=y's role, albeit usually under the condition of anonymity. "In the en=, it's 
very simple," says Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak. "=ermany is helping to defend Israel's security. The Germans can 
be proud of the fact that they have secured the existence =f the State of Israel for many years to come." 
On the other hand, =ny research that did take place in Israel was subject to censorship. Quote= by Israelis, as well as the 
photographer's pictures, had to be submitted =o the military. Questions about Israel's nuclear capability, whether on 
land or on water, were taboo. And decks 2 a=d 3, where the weapons are kept, remained off-limits to the visitors. 
In Germany, the gov=rnment's military assistance for Israel's submarine program has been contr=versial for about 25 
years, a topic of discussion for the media and the pa=liament. Chancellor Angela Merkel fears the kind of public debate 
that German Nobel literature laureate Gunter G=ass recently reignited with a poem critical of Israel. Merkel insists on 
s=crecy and doesn't want to the details of the deal to be made public. To th=s day, the German government is sticking to 
its position that it does not know anything about an Israeli nuclear we=pons program.
