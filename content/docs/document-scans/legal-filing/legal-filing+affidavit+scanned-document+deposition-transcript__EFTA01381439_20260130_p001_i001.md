Obligation to pay annual contributions and make one-time payments

administrative and other costs that are incurred by the statutory compensation scheme in the course of its 
activities. The annual contributions shall be calculated in accordance with section 19 (2) to (4), plus an 
appropriate flat-rate surcharge to cover the administrative and other costs. The compensation scheme 
may collect minimum contributions. The contribution assessment year runs from 1 October of one year to 
30 September of the following year. 
(2) In addition to the annual contribution, CRR credit institutions that were assigned to a statutory 
compensation scheme after 1 August 1998 are required to make a one-time payment calculated in 
accordance with section 19 (2) to (4).

depositors of a CRR credit institution assigned to the compensation scheme if a compensation 
event occurs, the CRR credit institutions assigned to this statutory compensation scheme shall be 
required 
1 
to pay extraordinary contributions as advance payments to cover the funds required in accordance 
with section 29 if a compensation event occurs or 
2 
to make extraordinary payments to repay loans to cover the funds required in accordance with
