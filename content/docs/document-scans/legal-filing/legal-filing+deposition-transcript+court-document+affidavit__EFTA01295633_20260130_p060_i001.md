785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
thus far was "incomplete in a number of important ways that ma[d]e it impossible to 
calculate reliable statistics." J.A. 399. Because of this "inadequate" data, the expert opined 
that he could not calculate "proper statistics" r102] or perform "any of th[e] three 
standard forms of statistical analysis." J.A. 403, 409. Without additional data, it was 
concededly "impossible to calculate . . . statistical patterns that might show whether or not 
a common issue of fact exists in this case." J.A. 403-04. Ultimately, the expert did not 
receive any of the additional data that he professed to need for a scientifically valid 
analysis. But, despite his sworn statements that the task was "impossible," he and another 
expert nevertheless produced statistical analyses based on the "incomplete" and 
"inadequate" data. 
Plaintiffs' experts' report confirms that they used incomplete data to support and reach 
their conclusions. For instance, even though the experts drew conclusions about positions 
throughout the Nucor plant, they did not employ any data from either the shipping or 
maintenance departments. J.A. 1154. They used only a "limited amount of data" for the 
remaining departments. J.A. 1153. And although Plaintiffs' experts chose to use bidding 
data to determine an expected number of black promotions, they conceded that 
incomplete data "undermined" their "ability to use posting and bidding records to analyze 
[those] promotions." r*103] J.A. 1161. Nucor's expert identified other basic issues in 
Plaintiffs' experts' data that the majority opinion ignores. See J.A. 5892. For instance, 
Plaintiffs' experts included a promotion won by an external candidate in their pool — even 
though this case only concerns internally filled promotions. They further overlooked seven 
selections of ['937] black employees for promotions. See J.A. 5891. 
The district court did not clearly err in discrediting this incomplete work and deeming it 
unworthy of evidentiary weight.

a. 
To further understand why Plaintiffs' statistical evidence is problematic, it helps to consider 
how it came about. In discovery, Nucor produced bidding packets and other promotion-
related applicant data covering certain promotions from January 2001 to February 2006. 
Plaintiffs' analysis of the 2001-2006 data indicated that the black selection rate fell only 
0.84 standard deviations from the mean -- a statistically insignificant result. See J.A. 5872. 
Fortunately for Plaintiffs, the district court limited the use of the actual data to the January 
2001 to December 2003 period. But an analysis of that period's data did not produce a 
statistically significant disparity, either. ["'104] At best, analysis of the 20012003 data 
produced disparities falling only 1.53 standard deviations from the mean. See J.A. 1449. 
Left with no results from actual records that suggested discrimination, Plaintiffs' experts set 
about creating extrapolated "benchmark" figures for promotions bidding between 
December 1999 and January 2001. They began by using so-called "change-of-status" 
forms plucked from personnel records to identify 27 purported promotions during the 
period. The experts then constructed a hypothetical bidding pool by essentially guessing 
that bidders in early years were racially identical to bidders in later ones. See J.A. 1162. 
With their theoretical promotion and bid figures established, Plaintiffs' experts then
