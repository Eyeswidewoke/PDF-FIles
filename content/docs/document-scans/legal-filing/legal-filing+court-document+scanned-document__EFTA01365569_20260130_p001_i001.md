supplemental indenture to facilitate Redemption Financing (including, without limitation, to grant a security interest 
to the Redemption Financing lender).

reasonable business judgment the expected proceeds of the sale of Collateral Obligations, any Redemption 
Financing and other funds available for distribution on the proposed Redemption Date would be at least sufficient to 
pay the Redemption Price on all of the Rated Notes. all Administrative Expenses and other fees and expenses 
payable under the Priority of Payments (including, without limitation, any Dissolution Expenses. am• accrued and 
unpaid Investment Management Fees and any amounts due to the Hedge Counterpanies).

remaining Collateral: provided that the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer), with the consent of a Majority 
of the Subordinated Securities, may, in lieu of directing the disposition of all or a portion of the Collateral, obtain 
Redemption Financing in an amount equal to the Market Value of such Collateral determined by (x) the Investment 
Manager or Cv) an independent party that regularly provides valuation of obligations similar to the remaining 
Collateral retained by the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on the Issuer's behalf). The Equity Redemption may 
not occur unless the expected proceeds available for distribution on the proposed Redemption Date would be at least 
sufficient to pay all Administrative Expenses and other fees and expenses payable under the Priority of Payments 
(including, without limitation, any Dissolution Expenses, any accrued and unpaid Investment Management Fees and 
any amounts due to the Hedge Counterpanies).

priorities and conditions set forth in a supplemental indenture and will redeem one or more designated Classes of 
Rated Notes (-Redeemed Notes") from the proceeds of the issuance of the Replacement Notes. No Refinancing will 
occur unless (a) the Investment Manager has consented. (b) the Replacement Notes are issued pursuant to a 
supplemental indenture, and (c) the related proceeds are sufficient to pay the Redemption Prices of each Class of 
Redeemed Notes. In addition if one or more Classes of Rated Notes will be Outstanding after such Refinancing, the 
following additional conditions must be satisfied:

Outstanding Amount of the corresponding proposed Class of Redeemed Notes except that where 
the Class of Redeemed Notes is the Lowest Ranking Class of Rated Notes the Aggregate 
Outstanding Amount of the Replacement Notes for that Class of Redeemed Notes may exceed the 
Aggregate Outstanding Amount of that Class of Redeemed Notes: 
•

corresponding proposed Class of Redeemed Notes:

no class of Replacement Notes has a higher priority of right of payment than the corresponding 
proposed Class of Redeemed Notes:
