FX Blueprint: Forever Young 
Europeans abandoning Europe 
On the other side of the Atlantic the recovery remains 
intact but the euro has not been responsive to better 
European data. Ongoing ECB dovishness, negative 
yields, and European investors' large underweight in 
foreign assets all suggest that these outflows are likely 
to continue, a phenomenon we have previously termed 
Euroglut. Interestingly, the composition of portfolio 
flows between different investors has undergone a 
significant 
transformation 
over 
2015. 
Non-bank 
portfolio flows have become the dominant portion of 
Euro-area capital outflows, suggestive of underlying 
shifts in European investor preferences rather than 
changes to bank balance sheets that are also typically 
hedged (chart 4). 
ECB taper not important as Fed rate hikes 
Persistent weakness in the oil price and downside 
surprises to inflation suggest that the risks are skewed 
toward more ECB easing this year. But could a decision 
by the ECB to taper its QE purchases later mark the 
end of the EUR/USD bear run and by extension the 
long-term dollar up-cycle? It is doubtful this would be 
the case because ECB decisions on QE are more 
relevant for the long-end of the European curve rather 
than near-term rate expectations. The latter in turn 
exert significantly higher influence on FX (chart 5). So 
long as the European short-end remains anchored, it 
will be the pace and timing of the Fed cycle that will 
dominate dollar drivers rather than the pace of ECB 
China and risks to dollar outlook 
The biggest risk to our dollar view is a significant 
slowdown in the US economy that stops (rather than 
decelerates) the Fed hiking cycle and potentially brings 
easing back on the table. Beyond that, portfolio flows, 
relative central bank cycles, and China's recent 
willingness to tolerate more dollar strength all suggest 
the dollar has more scope to appreciate in 2016. The 
latter is particularly important because past USDCNY 
stability has prevented the broad trade-weighted dollar 
from appreciating as much as the narrow index given 
China's high weighting. Given our ongoing bearishness 
on RMB (see theme 3) we therefore prefer the broad 
over the narrow trade-weighted dollar, which also 
remains cheaper on account of CNY valuations. Indeed, 
even if the current dollar rally is faster than the late 
1990s, it remains well within the bounds of previous 
dollar cycles. We remain bullish on the dollar while also 
looking for a move down to 95cents in EUR/USD by the 
end of the year.
