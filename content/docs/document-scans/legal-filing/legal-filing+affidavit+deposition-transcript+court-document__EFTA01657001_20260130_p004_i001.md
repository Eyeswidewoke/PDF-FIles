4 / GEISELMAN: ME COONMVE INTERVIEW FOR SUSPECTS 
2. Narrative. Research shows that the vast majority of persons put in a position of being deceptive 
choose to offer only the highlights of their story or a bare bones account (6, 8, 16). The typical justifica-
tion for such an abbreviated narrative is that to be more elaborate would appear as an attempt to convince 
the interviewer, or to "sell" the story (16). In contrast, the elements of the original CI leading up to the 
request for the narrative raise the expectation that the subject will be detailed in the narrative. In fact, the 
subject is instructed precisely to tell the story in as much detail as possible, and to take as much time as 
needed to concentrate. The elements of the original CI leading up to the narrative include: transfer of con-
trol to the subject ("You were there, I was not, so I am relying on you for the information I need."); re-
quest for a detailed account; and reconstruction of the environmental and physical context that existed just 
prior to the beginning of the event in question. More information provides a greater opportunity to pro-
duce conflicting details and/or details that are incriminating or known to be false. The interviewer should 
use "extenders" and other prompts to keep the narrative going as long as possible ("Really... tell me more 
about that."). 
3. Drawing/Sketch. The interviewer's request for an illustration of the story from the narrative stage is 
unexpected by the subject. Research shows that unexpected requests can trip up a liar (17, 18). The re-
quest for an illustration should be presented as a means to clarify the narrative for greater understanding 
by the interviewer as well as to give the subject another opportunity to recall additional information. Look 
for unusual difficulty in making the drawing/diagram as well as for inconsistencies and a lack of addition-
al elaboration—liars tend to have greater difficulty, exhibit more inconsistencies, and produce little, if 
any, additional details compared with truthful subjects. 
4. Follow-up, Open-Ended Questions. The follow-up, open-ended questions should be presented as 
information-gathering rather than as confrontational to maintain the momentum toward generating more 
information from the suspect. Liars typically answer these questions with minimal elaboration without 
offering much that is new (19). Look for changes in body language from the rapport stage as well as for 
the more reliable indicators of deception (leakage) as described above. 
5. Reverse-Order Technique. When all of the scenes from the narrative have been exhausted with fol-
low-up questioning, introduce the reverse-order technique as another means for possibly jogging the sub-
ject's memory for additional details. Research shows that deceptive persons have unusual difficulty telling 
their fabricated stories backward (6, 7). Recalling a story backward increases cognitive load, and the de-
ceptive subject's cognitive resources already are being strained to the limit to maintain the consistency of 
the story. Because of the additional reduction in their cognitive resources, research shows that the more 
reliable indicators of deception as described above are more likely to appear (leakage). Look for these 
signs to be more apparent during the reverse-order task. 
6. Challenge. At this point, the subject will be confronted about inconsistencies, incriminating state-
ments, and/or external incriminating evidence. None of these elements should be addressed prior to this
