. Spin-off Limited Too to shareholders in a tax-free transaction enabling =t to be a fully independent company. 
. Sell a majority interest in our Galyan's Trading Co., an active life=tyle superstore retailer, to Freeman Spogli & Co." 
First Quarter Expectations 
Mr. Wexner commented: "For the past several years, we have been growin= our brand recognition with great success at 
Victoria's Secret and Bath &= Body Works, both units of Intimate Brands. The historic live Webcast of the 'World'=s Most 
Watched Fashion Show' broke Internet and e-commerce records. We are br=nging the same focus and innovation to our 
apparel businesses, as demonstrated by=our first quarter results." 
Specifically, the Company expects to report April total sales of $639.9 mil=ion, an increase in comparable store sales of 
5% and first quarter earnings per =hare of 5.14, an increase of 56% over an adjusted 5.09 per share in 1998. This 
represents a significant increase over the current Wall Street consensus estimate of 5.10 per share, and is primarily the 
result of strong first qua=ter performances at the Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant, and Limited Too brands, as 
well as at Intimate Brands, Inc. (NYSE: IBI). 
Additionally, due to the momentum in the apparel brands, the Company now ex=ects to exceed the current second 
quarter Wall Street consensus estimate of $.15=per share by 5.03. 
15 Million Share Stock Repurchase 
"The Board has been evaluating uses of excess cash generated from both operations and the sale of non-core assets 
over the last several years. We=have now determined that, with the improved performance of our apparel brands, a 
significant share repurchase would be a tax-efficient way to distribute thi= excess cash to shareholders. This share 
repurchase further demonstrates management's and the Board's confidence in our business and its fut=re," Mr. Wexner 
said. 
Accordingly, The Limited, Inc.'s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 15 million shares of its 
common stock. Neither Mr. Wex=er nor his affiliates will participate. The repurchase will be made through a "Dutch 
Auction" tender offer in which The Limited, Inc.'s sha=eholders will be given the opportunity to sell a portion or all of 
their shares to the Compa=y at a price of not less than $50 per share, and not more than $55 per share. T=e offer to 
purchase shares will commence on May 4,1999 and will expire at 12:=0 midnight, New York City time on June 1, 1999, 
unless extended by the Compan=. 
If the number of shares tendered is greater than the number sought, the Com=any will select the lowest price within the 
stated range that will allow it to =uy 15 million shares, with purchases to be made on a pro rata basis from shareholders 
tendering at or below the purchase price. 
The Company also announced the rescission of the Contingent Stock Redemptio= Agreement, thereby making available 
the $351.6 million in cash that previou=ly had been held on a restricted basis to honor the Company's obligations =nder 
the Agreement. This cash and other available funds will be utilized to repurch=se shares under the self-tender. 
This news release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of off=rs to sell common stock. The self-tender is 
being made only by means of an Of=er to Purchase and related documents, copies of which will be mailed to all 
shareholders and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may=also be obtained from the information 
agent, D.F. King & Co., Inc. In conne=tion with the self-tender, The Limited, Inc. has retained Lazard Freres & Co= LLC and 
J.P. Morgan & Co. to act as dealer managers.
