argument of [6], then we contrast its assumptions with those made here. 
A.1 The claim that DSR implies macroscopic non-locality 
The conclusions of reference [6] are arrived at by reasoning directly from several assumptions to 
a conclusion about how the experiment would look in Bob's frame of reference. The first three of 
these assumptions can be taken to be 
• A) Both observers can describe the photons' trajectories accurately in terms of worldlines in 
Minkowski spacetime. 
• B) Both observers assume that the same equation (1) holds in their frame's coordinates. 
• C) Both observers assume that the two photons left the gamma ray burst from the same point 
at the same time, ie at a single value of the spacetime coordinates in each frame6. 
Given these assumptions, simple algebra leads to the conclusion that Bob does not see the 
electron and the second photon to pass through the detector at the same time. Indeed, with L at 
cosmological distances and AE 
10Gev, as might describe a real event detected by Fermi, they 
miss by about 10-5 of a second, which given that the second photon is going almost the speed of 
light amounts to a very large miss in terms of spatial distance. 
From this [6] concludes that either there is an inconsistency in the theory (because it is claimed 
that that the three assumptions A, B and C follow from the relativity of inertial frames) or Bob 
must deduce that there are in physics highly non-local interactions which allow the second photon 
to scatter from the electron in spite of being separated by 10-6 light seconds. 
[6] then argues that there are good experimental bounds on non-locality, which applied to this 
situation restrict a < 10-23. This part of the argument rests on a fourth assumption 
• D The kind of non-local interactions produced by lorentz transformations in DSR theories 
are sufficiently generic that existing bounds on ranges of interactions from experiments that 
do not involve moving frames observing light that has traveled for billions of light years can 
be used to bound a in this experiment. 
A.2 Comparison of the results of the different approaches 
We can now compare the results of [6] with those found here for ,c-Minkowski spacetime. 
The case most relevant for the assumptions of [6] is that of the commuting coordinates, as these 
lead to an energy dependent speed of light. There are two differences. In [6J there is macroscopic 
non-locality at the detector seen in Bob's satellite frame, whereas in rc-Minkowski spacetime the 
non-locality seen by Bob is much smaller, of order 1. 
The second difference is that in [6] the emission event is fixed by assumption C to have a 
single coordinate in all reference frames, whereas in K-Minkowski spacetime Bob's description 
'It should be emphasized that C is not explicitly stated in (6), however it is the most natural interpretation of Figures 
1 and 2 of that paper. (Note the worldlines corresponding to the two photons crossing in both diagrams in the lower 
left hand corner.) C is equivalent, within the framework of [6), to the statement that the formula for the time delay r 
(2) should hold in all frames of reference. It is also equivalent to assuming that the fixed point of the boost from the lab 
to the satellite frame is at the emission point, at least in the framework discussed here.
