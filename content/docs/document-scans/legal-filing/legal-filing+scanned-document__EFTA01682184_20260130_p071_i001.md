He broke bread at the same table as the private equity magnate Henry Kravis, who is worth 
$US2.6 billion - although both of them, apparently, only turned up for dessert. 
Elsewhere in the room was the flamboyant property developer Donald Trump ($US2.9 billion) and 
Donald Lauder ($US3 billion), the philanthropist son of the late cosmetics tycoon Estee Lauder. 
Completing the billionaires club were the New York Daily News publisher Mort Zuckerman, who has 
$US2.8 billion to his name, and A. Alfred Taubman - the then Sotheby's chairman worth $US2 
billion who was sent to jail in 2002 for price fixing. 
The restaurant, La Grenouille, was recently described by the New York Times as "one of the last 
bastions of haute cuisine" in the Big Apple. It pulled out all the stops for the Blacks' soiree. 
To tickle guests' appetites, there were amuse bouches of Beluga caviar, lobster and cucumber 
salad, beef carpaccio and cheese puffs washed down with $US320-a-bottle 1993 Dom Perignon 
champagne. The well-heeled revellers tucked into lobster ravioli or veal with herbes and gnocchi, 
followed by a chocolate "coppelia" and truffles. 
In total, the party got through $US13,000 of wine including 26 bottles of 1998 Chassagne 
Montrachet Prosper Maufoux (a snip at $US130 each) and 23 bottles of Clos Vougeot Prosper 
Maufoux, priced at $US205 each. 
The seating plan gives clues on just how everybody fitted into the social ranking. Lord Black, who 
claims he was striking business deals at the event, was surrounded by the Vogue editor Anna 
Wintour, the Dame Edna Everage impersonator Barry Humphries and a clutch of celebrity wives -
including Sir Evelyn de Rothschild's spouse, Lynn, and Henry Ford II's widow, Kate. 
Birthday girl Barbara Amiel chose slightly more heavyweight companions. Her table included the 
legendary statesman Henry Kissinger, who was a Hollinger director and is now listed as a possible 
prosecution witness in her husband's trial. They exchanged pleasantries with Donald Trump, the 
news anchor Peter Jennings who subsequently died in 2005, the former New Yorker editor Tina 
Brown and Bill Clinton's one-time close adviser Vernon Jordan. 
Just how much business took place during the evening is a moot point. Prosecutors say the party 
was little more than a lavish social event at Hollinger shareholders' expense. But Lord Black's 
lawyer, Ed Genson, has pointed out that many of those present were "media people" and thus, he 
maintains, there was legitimate networking to be done by the then Daily Telegraph owner. 
With the possible exception of Lord Black's nephew, Matthew Doull, and a couple of senior Hollinger 
executives, barely anybody at the event could be described as a "civilian" member of the public. 
On one table, television presenter Barbara Walter ate with Drue Heinz, widow of the ketchup boss 
HJ Heinz II, and the then president of New York's Federal Reserve, William McDonough. 
Others in the room included the New York Review of Books' founder Robert Silvers and Midge 
Decter - an ultra-conservative writer known recently for writing a book in defence of Donald 
Rumsfeld in which she argued passionately for the former defence secretary's "manliness".
