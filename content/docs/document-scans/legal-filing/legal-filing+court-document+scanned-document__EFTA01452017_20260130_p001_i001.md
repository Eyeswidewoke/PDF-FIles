SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Section 10: Certain Legal ERISA and Tax Considerations 
Secondary Opportunities Fund III, LP 
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to part 4 of Title I of ERISA; (ii) a 'plan, account or arrangement" within 
the meaning of and subject to Section 4975 of the Code; and (iii) any entity whose underlying assets include 'plan 
assets' by reason of a plan's investment in such entity (e.g.. an entity of which 25% or more of the value of any class of 
equity interests is held by benefit plan investors and which does not satisfy any exception under the DOL regulations). 
An entity will be considered a Benefit Plan Investor only to the extent of the percentage of its equity interests that are 
held by Benefit Plan Investors. Under the 25% Test, the value of equity interests held by a person (other than a Benefit 
Plan Investor) that has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the entity or that provides 
investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets (or an affiliate of such person ) is disregarded. 
The Manager will use reasonable best efforts to operate the Fund in compliance with the 25% Test so that the 
investments of the Fund do not constitute 'plan assets" for purposes of ERISA. In this connection, the Manager will limit 
acquisitions, transfers and withdrawals by Investors, and may require the withdrawal of any Investor that is a Benefit Plan 
Investor. 
Form 5500 
Plan administrators of Investors that are subject to ERISA may be required to report on Form 5500 Annual Retum/Report 
compensation paid to the Manager and the General Partner. The descriptions of fees and compensation contained 
herein, and in the descriptions of the priority profit share and carried interest set forth in Section 7: Summary of Terms 
and Conditions above are intended to satisfy the disclosure requirements for 'eligible indirect compensation' for which 
the alternative reporting option on Schedule C of Form 5500 may be available. 
Investors such as pension funds that are subject to the provisions of ERISA should consult with their counsel 
and advisers as to the provisions of ERISA applicable to an investment in the Fund. 
Certain tax considerations 
IRS Circular 230 Disclosure: This Memorandum was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used 
by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under US federal 
tax law. This Memorandum was written to support the promotion or marketing of the Fund. Each taxpayer 
should seek advice based on the taxpayer's particular circumstances from an independent tax adviser. 
Certain US federal income tax considerations 
The following is a discussion of certain US federal income tax considerations relating to an investment in the Fund and 
does not purport to address all of the US federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to any particular 
Investor. For example, except as expressly described below, the discussion does not address the tax consequences of 
the disposition of an interest in the Fund. This discussion is based on laws, including the Code, regulations and other 
authorities in effect as of the date of this Memorandum, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive 
effect. The US federal income taxation of partnerships and partners is extremely complex, involving, among other things. 
significant issues as to the character, timing of realisation and sourcing of gains and losses. Investors are urged to 
consult their own tax advisers prior to investing in the Fund with respect to their particular tax situations, including, in the 
case of Investors subject to special rules under US federal income tax laws (such as banks, dealers in securities, life 
insurance companies, tax-exempt Investors and non-US Investors), with reference to any special issues that investment 
in the Fund may raise for such persons. The activities of an Investor unrelated to such Investor's status as an Investor in 
the Fund may affect the tax consequences to such Investor of an investment in the Fund. 
Treatment as partnership. The Manager intends that the Fund be treated as a partnership for US federal income tax 
purposes. As a partnership, the Fund will generally not be subject to US federal income tax. Instead, each Investor that 
is subject to US tax will be required to take into account its distributive share, whether or not distributed, of each item of 
the Fund's income, gain, loss, deduction or credit. It is possible that in any year, an Investor's tax liability arising from the 
Fund could exceed the distributions made by the Fund to such Investor. The Fund will provide such Investors with the 
information with respect to the operations of the Fund necessary to file their US federal income tax retums. However. 
Investors may not receive such information prior to when their tax return reporting obligations become due and may need
