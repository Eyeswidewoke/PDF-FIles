EX Blueprint Thin end of the wedge 
Theme In: Trend no bitter end 
In 2007 we replicated a RBA study that claimed non-
commercial "profit seekers" made money on their IMM 
positions at the expense of commercial "liquidity 
seekers". 3 The striking conclusion is that currency 
speculators generally know the correct direction of 05 
currencies and investors can profit from knowing their 
positions (although these signals are less useful in 
practice since IMM data is lagged three days). 
In a sense, money is "left on the table" by commercial 
foreign exchange users, and to a lesser extent by 
foreign bond and equity investors, which can be earned 
by non-commercial actors that provide liquidity to 
currency markets. These profit seekers collect FX risk 
premia in the same manner Keynes first identified 
when describing risk transfer in commodity markets.' 
Profit Seekers Made Money in Every Year since 2003 
By our calculations, non-commercial positions made 
money in every year since data was first released in 
1993, mainly at the expense of commercial users 
(dealers also made money).5 In recent years profits 
have come from timing big EUR/USD moves (2010-11) 
and catching last year's USD/JPY rise. 
These P&L 
numbers more closely resemble pre-crisis profits than 
the outsize gain in 2008 (reflecting higher FX volatility) 
and the nearly flat 2009 period (probably due to an 
unexpected GBP rebound). 
IS P&L Eroded As Speculators Accumulate Positions? 
Our analysis rests on the crucial assumption that profit 
seekers accumulate positions over the course of the 
week at the average price. By contrast, live trading 
metrics such as the Parker Index of currency manager 
returns show a loss since 2011 as currency volatility 
has overwhelmed macro trends (with the exception of 
USD/JPY in 2013) even as the correlation between 
weekly IMM P&L and Parker returns remains positive. 
It is possible that infra-week volatility causes profit 
seekers (especially momentum traders) to "buy high 
and sell low" relative to WVAP and that IMM P&L is 
eroded when currencies trade in a choppy range. 
Fortunately for investors FX volatility continues to fall 
and promising trends (JPY, CAD) have emerged.

We calculate weekly P&L by determining the notional value of 
positions on Tuesday and assuming longs and shorts are accumulated 
(or squared) at the average puce over the course of the week
