Special Report: The treat Accumulation' Is Over: FX Reserves Have Peaked. Beware OT 
central banks. Regressing EUR/USD on the 2Y real rate spread and global reserves 
in first differences—the latter entering with a two-month lag to ensure strict 
exogeneity—indicates that the above shock would be worth a depreciation of 6 
cents. 
This first estimate proved surprisingly robust when using dynamic vector-
autoregressive models again to deal with endogeneity and lags more properly: the 
likely impact on EUR/USD amounts to almost 7 cents in the first three months 
before petering out. Our models also include the rate spread, ordered above the 
exchange rate. The much greater positive impact on US than Eurozone yields 
raises the 2Y real rate spread in favour of the US, consistent with the negative 
impact on the exchange rate (Figure 26). A rough beta therefore associates an 
exogenous shock to global reserves—that is one not triggered by valuation 
effects—worth $100bn with EUR/USD by weakening by 3 cents. For other reserve 
currencies, however, our models yielded insignificant results.

Moving to the impact on fixed income, declining FX reserves should place upward 
pressure on developed market yields given that the bulk of reserves are allocated 
to fixed income. In a number of seminal speeches, Ben Bernanke argued that it 
was the EM "savings glut" and the reserve accumulation that accompanied it that 
contributed to unusually low bond yields in the 2000s known at the Greenspan 
"bond conundrum".'' A large literature has been generated since. A recent working 
paper by ECB staff shows that the increase in foreign holdings of euro area bonds 
from 2000 to mid-2006 - Greenspan's "bond conundrum" period - is associated 
with a reduction of euro area long-term interest rates by about 1.55 percentage 
points, in line with the estimated impact on US Treasury yields by other studies.' 
On the short-term impact, one recent paper estimates that "if foreign official 
inflows into U.S. Treasuries were to decrease in a given month by $100 billion, 5-
year Treasury rates would rise by about 40-60 basis points in the short run", 
consistent with our estimates above.' China and oil exporting countries played an 
important role in these flows.
