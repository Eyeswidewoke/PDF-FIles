Fiscal, Policy, and Legal Considerations Regarding State Compliance with the Adam Walsh Act 
not all, of the requirements of SORNA, including perhaps the most debated requirement of SORNA: the 
registration of some juveniles adjudicated delinquent of certain sex offenses. In the 2008 Legislative Session, bills 
were filed but not passed in both chambers (SB 1698 and HB 1333) to adopt additional requirements of SORNA. 
MB 1333 contained the latest revisions, and therefore, is discussed in this brief. This legislation will need to be re-
written if the Legislature intends to substantially implement SORNA, since it was drafted prior to release of the 
final SORNA guidelines ("guidelines") by the U.S. Attorney General .° 
If legislators decide not to substantially implement SORNA then Florida's registration/notification laws can be 
shaped by legislators without the need to consider whether those laws will substantially implement SORNA and 
ensure full JAG funding. The JAG funding penalty to ensure SORNA compliance is only federal leverage if a 
state determines that it must have full JAG funding. Legislators would be free to determine which, if any, SORNA 
requirements to adopt, and could even reconsider and remove SORNA requirements previously adopted, 
depending on their determination of the state's best interests? It is uncertain if non-compliance with SORNA 
could be used as state leverage for Congress to reconsider at least those requirements that have generated the most 
debate or controversy, but it seems intuitive that Florida's decision not to comply with SORNA would be of 
significant concern and importance to Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Sex Offender 
Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking (SMART). which administers the SORNA 
standards. Florida has one of the largest pools of registered sex offenders in the country,8 so Florida's non-
compliance with SORNA might call into question whether the AWA can, in fact, establish "a comprehensive 
national system for the registration" of sex offenders (SORNA § 102), one of its declared purposes.9
Fiscal Impact of SORNA Compliance 
While states are free to choose not to substantially implement SORNA, non-compliance will result in a 10 percent 
reduction in Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funding. All states are currently under time constraints to 
comply with SORNA. The implementation deadline is July 27, 2009, but the U.S. Attorney General has the 
authority to grant up to two 1-year extensions of the implementation deadline. The Florida Department of Law 
Enforcement (FDLE) has indicated it intends to file for a one-year extension as it is unclear at this time whether 
the Legislature intends to substantially implement SORNA. 
States are beginning to look at whether they can afford to comply with SORNA. However, it is impossible to 
definitively state what it would cost Florida to comply with SORNA and what Florida stands to lose based on the 
reduction of 10 percent JAG funding for not complying with SORNA. This is because of uncertainty about future 
JAG funding, how the JAG funding penalty would be applied, and the availability and duration of grant funding

7 If legislators reconsidered SORNA requirements previously adopted, this reconsideration would presumably entail 
examining the intent in adopting those requirements and what has actually occurred as a consequence of their adoption. For 
example, as a consequence of the adoption of the requirement that some juveniles adjudicated delinquent of certain sexual 
offenses register as sexual offenders (a SORNA requirement) pleas may have been accepted to lesser offenses (such as 
battery) so juveniles do not have to register as sexual offenders, a situation that might not have occurred but for this 
requirement. 
8 As of August 3, 2008, the date FDLE reported this information, there were 7,227 persons required to register as sexual 
predators and 42,485 persons required to register as sexual offenders. 
Florida has always complied with federal legislation that affects state registration/notification laws. Florida has also been 
recognized by two non-governmental organizations for its sexual offender notification laws and public sex offender website. 
Parents for Megan's Law, a not-for-profit community and victim's rights organization, gave Florida's sex offender 
notification laws its only "A+" grade in its last assessment of states' sex offender notification laws (2006) 
(http://www.parentsformeganslaw.cotthitmlilinks.lasso). TopTenREVIEWS, Inc., a technology review site, ranked FDLE's 
sex offender registry website as the best in the country (http://sex-offender-registry-revicwroptenrevicws.com/florida-
review.html). These factors may also be of importance to the federal government in regard to what the impact may be if 
Florida does not comply with SORNA.
