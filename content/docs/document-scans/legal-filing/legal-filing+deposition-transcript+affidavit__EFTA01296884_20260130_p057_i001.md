44 Misc. 3d 280, *; 982 N.Y.S.2d 868, "; 
2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1404, ***; 2014 NY Slip Op 24083 
that 2784 LLC would give a loan to Neptune LLC and that this loan was authorized by the 
members. She further asserts that there is no damage to any member because the 
$250,000 loaned by 2784 LLC is earning interest at five percent and is secured by the real 
estate, and that when the Neptune Avenue premises are sold, the mortgage will be paid to 
2784 LLC with interest and all of the members of both 2784 LLC and Neptune LLC will 
receive their pro rata shares. She also states that plaintiffs received payments at the same 
time and "in pro rata amounts as the other members." 
The second amended ["**26] complaint, however, does not challenge the $250,000 loan 
made by 2784 LLC to Neptune LLC and does not allege that the sale of the 2784 
premises was unauthorized. Rather, plaintiffs assert that Bums wrongfully deprived them 
of their fair share of the distributions from the net proceeds of the sale of these premises. 
Specifically, plaintiffs contend that Burns unilaterally and wrongfully withheld sums from 
their individual distributions because of their refusal to vacate their rent-stabilized 
apartments at the Neptune Avenue premises. Plaintiffs have annexed a letter by Bums 
dated March 9, 2010 (exhibit E to plaintiffs' opposition papers), which establishes that 
Burns, referring to Benevento's and Neary's apartments at the Neptune Avenue premises, 
unilaterally deducted from their individual distributions of the net sale proceeds of the 2784 
premises that were issued by 2784 LLC in March 2010, amounts for "disparate benefits" 
that Burns claims they received by virtue of their rent-stabilized tenancies at the Neptune 
Avenue premises. This letter shows that in contrast to the distributions to plaintiffs, these 
sums were not deducted from the distributions received by the other two Neary [" -27] 
members (Salvatore and Mary Ann), Anthony (Benevento's brother), ["879] or Grace, 
who were paid their distributions in full. 
295] Burns further argues that he should be absolved from liability pursuant to article 4.5 
of the operating agreement (exhibit 7 to Burns' motion papers), which provides as follows: 
"A Manager shall not be personally liable to the Company or its Members for damages for any breach of duty as a 
Manager, except for any matter In respect to which such Manager shall be liable by reason that, in addition to any and 
all other requirements for such liability. there shall have been a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such 
Manager that establshes that such Manager's acts or omissions were in bad faith or Involved intentional misconduct or 
a knowing violation of law or that such Manager personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which 
such Manager was not legally entitled or that with respect to a distnbution the subject of Section 508 of the [Limited 
Liability Company Law]. such Manager's acts were not performed in accordance with Section 409 of the [Limited 
Liability Company Law]" 
[HN6] Limited Liability Company Law § 508 refers to limitations ["**28] on distributions to 
members. Limited Liability Company Law § 409 (a) provides that [HN7] "[a] manager shall 
perform his or her duties as a manager, including his or her duties as a member of any 
class of managers, in good faith and with that degree of care that an ordinarily prudent 
person in a like position would use under similar circumstances." 
[4] Bums contends that he did not act in bad faith or engage in intentional misconduct. 
However, plaintiffs' allegations, which must be deemed true for purposes of this motion, 
sufficiently allege such bad faith, asserting that Burns acted "maliciously, wrongfully, and 
unlawfully," and in breach of his fiduciary duties. Thus, despite Bums' attomey's argument 
that Burns acted properly, questions of fact are raised as to this issue.
