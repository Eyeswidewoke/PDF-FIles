Phaidon had a working cap line with Lloyds Bank when=the company was acquired. When the line was 
up for renewal Lloyds requeste= full net worth information on Leon which we preferred not to supply. Leon=suggested 
we move the line to Bank of America. At first B of A said they'd be unable set up the line =ecause of this being a UK 
based company. Jane Heller, our lender, in her u=ual style came through with an alternative but as we moved through 
the dia=og the bank was insistent on language in the loan document which was far too restrictive regarding the trusts 
which=were to provide a guarantee. Richard Ressler suggested we set up a line fr=m one of the family entities in a 
commercially reasonable fashion. Since w= had gone pretty with B of A, Ada worked with Paul Weiss to adapt the B of A 
loan agreement, adjusting to mo=erate restrictions I referred to. The trustees signed off on guarant=e of the line and 
two artworks owned by the 1997 Trust were provided as co=lateral. 
The credit facility had a maturity of one year becau=e B of A had offered only a one year maturity. Limit 
on the facility was s=t at $15mil in order to facilitate funding of Regan Arts as well as Phaido=. The same schedule of 
permitted drawdowns that had been part of the Lloyds facility was attached to the lo=n agreement. With hindsight, the 
document Paul Weiss had worked with Ada t= create facilitated lending from Black Family Partners to Phaidon Gl=bal 
but did not provide documentation for the borrowing from Phaidon Global by the operating company, Phaidon Pr=ss. 
We put simple notes in place for each of the drawdowns you will see on=the table below as documentation of the 
advances to the operating company.= 
The left side of the table below shows the permitted=drawdown schedule. The right side of the table 
show the actual activity.=C2 You will see the an additional draw of $300k in December 2013 above =he schedule which 
came as a request from the Phaidon CFO and Leon approved. In the February-April period when repay=ent of the line 
was normally made using cash generated from the seasonally=high period, only one-half of the scheduled repayment 
was made due to a ti=ht cash situation. In the Apr-Jul period the balance moved back into range (with the addl $300k). 
Phaidon =80 s new management team joined in April. In the subsequent months, Keit= and John worked to get their 
arms around the cash needs for the balance o= the calendar year. These cash needs reflected a higher payroll tied to the 
new hires as well as weak business trends in =all 2014 (a result of the period of management turmoil that had preceded 
t=e new team joining). There has been much discussion of cash needs fo= consecutive Board meetings since August. 
Forecast of need for 4.2-4.5mil GBP ($6.6mil) has been consistent since Ju=y financials were produced. Authorization for 
additional funding was given=at the Board Meeting. August, Sept, and Oct draws on the table below=followed as 
needed. It was agreed at the November Board meeting that it made sense to term out the $8mil balanc= to five years 
and establish a shorter facility for the working cap needs =n the next 12 months. 
The actual credit facility expired in September. =AO At that point the team here began to discuss a 
different structure, one=with the underlying owners of Phaidon Global as liquidity providers rather=than Black Family 
Partners. Unfortunately, it was only late last month at the Trustees meeting the dialog was pursued=with enough depth 
that an action plan was laid out.
