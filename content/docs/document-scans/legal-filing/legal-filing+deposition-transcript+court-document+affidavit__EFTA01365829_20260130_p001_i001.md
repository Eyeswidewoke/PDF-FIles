Our Dining Experience 
Our restaurants offer a differentiated prix fixe menu as well as select it la carte options. For the full churrasco experience. the prix fixe menu 
includes two courgs. Guests can begin at the Market Table, which features a variety of gourmet side dishes. seasonal salads. Brazilian hearts of 
palm, fresh-cut vegetables, aged cheeses. smoked salmon and cured meats, and is available immediately after the guests are seated. 
The second course of the menu is the rodizio (meat) service. We offer a selection of up to 20 cuts of beef, lamb, pork and chicken fire-roasted 
over open flames in the traditional Brazilian style. Gaucho chefs rotate through the dining room, with each server responsible for a single cut of 
meat that is carved table-side to guests' specifications. Some of our most popular Brazilian style cuts include the picanha. our signature cut (a part 
of the sirloin), alcatra (cut from the top sirloin), new beef ancho (the prime part of the rib eye),fmklinha (bottom sirloin), linguica (robust pork 
sausages) and costela (beef ribs). 
Each guest has beside them a two-sided medallion with one side red and one side green. When a guest is ready to begin enjoying the various 
selections of meat they simply turn the medallion to green. This signals our gaucho chefs to visit that table and offer whatever cut of meat they are 
serving. Guests can pause the service at any time by turning the medallion to red and then back to green when they are ready to try additional 
selections, and can communicate to our gauchos any specific cut of meat they prefer. The medallion allows customization so the guest can control 
the pace and choice of meats. Each cut is caned by our gaucho chefs in a manner designed to both enhance the tenderness of each slice as well as 
meet our guests' desired portion size and temperature. 
To complement the meats. a variety of sharable side dishes. including warm cheese bread, fried bananas and crispy polenta. among various 
other selections, arc brought to each table and replenished throughout the meal. Our restaurants also offer a selection of traditional desserts, 
including papaya cream and ties leches. 
For guests preferring lighter fare, we also offer Brazilian-inspired a la carte seafood options, which we introduced in February 2014 across our 
restaurant base to increase guest frequency and broaden the appeal of our menu. We also offer the option to have only food from the Market Table. 
Our menu options are enhanced by an award-winning wine list and a full bar complete with a selection of signature Brazilian drinks such as the 
caipirinha. In March 2014, we introduced Bar Fogo a "mall-plates" menu offered at the bar designed to enhance our bar experience, increase 
alcohol sales and drive higher spend per guest. We believe there is substantial opportunity to increase guest frequency and spend per guest through 
continued menu innovation and day-part expansion. 
Restaurant Management and Operations 
Restaurant Organizational Structure 
Each restaurant typically employs approximately 60 to 85 people. There are approximately 10 to 12 gaucho chefs per restaurant. Supporting 
the gaucho chefs are approximately 10 to 30 servers and approximately 10 to 30 bussers and kitchen staff as well as other operating personnel. Our 
gaucho chefs butcher, prepare, fire-roast and serve all our meats. Each restaurant has a general manager and an assistant general manager. and half 
of our restaurants in the United States employ a second assistant manager. To promote authenticity. continuity of the chumssaco culture and 
improved operations, most of our employees holding management-level positions and our general managers arc former gaucho chefs. 
We emphasize a culture of collaboration within the management of our restaurants to facilitate the continuous development of "best practices" 
regarding guest service, cost control and growth opportunities. In both our United States and Brazilian operations, our general managers meet each 
week to discuss performance and opportunities for improvement.
