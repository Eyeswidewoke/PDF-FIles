But, according to the Columbia study, those government programs and others are keeping millions o= Americans out of 
poverty and were particularly important during the recessi=n. In 2012, the supplemental poverty measure was 16 
percent. Without programs like food stamps, Medicaid and Social Security= it would have been 31 percent, the study 
found. "You're not seein= nearly the jumps in poverty under the supplemental poverty measure as you saw in previous 
recessions, and that seems to be because we took a lot of concrete policy actions," like extending unemployment 
benefits and expanding the f=od stamp program, Wimer said. "These things have sort of stanched some of the bleeding 
in the economy." 
I often wonder about people like Marco Rubio whose mi=sion is to do everything they can to eviscerate, weaken or kill 
social programs =hat provide a safety net for children, poor, elderly and the less fortunate and then claim that they 
haven't worked. It is akin to defunding NASA and then suggest that it is a failure from the st=rt. First of all, why 
wouldn't the richest country on the planet not believe that the most venerable Americans be prov=ded as much 
protection as possible? Especially, those of us who consider ourselves Christians. As someone wh= grew up in a 
household that was only able survive with the assistance of Welfare, I can tell you from first=hand experience that it 
wasn't a luxury and without it the human toll=would have been much worse. So if we want our social programs to be 
successful we have to truly support them and we have to stop ridiculi=g recipients. Remember expectation is 90% of 
success because if you can't envision a way-out it is difficult to find a pathway to succ=ss.

To settle a barr=ge of government legal actions over the last year, JPMorgan Chase has agreed to penalties that now
