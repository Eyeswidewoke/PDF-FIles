such factors as it deems relevant and in view of the fair and equal treatment of Investors. When 
distributions are made in kind, they will be treated as cash distributions for purposes of applying the 
distribution provisions. 
19. 
TAXATION 
Luxembourg 
19.1 
The Company's assets are subject to tax (tare d'abonnetnent) in Luxembourg of 0.01% p.a. on net 
assets, payable quarterly. In case some Compartments are invested in other Luxembourg undertakings 
for collective investment, which in turn are subject to the subscription tax provided for by the 2007 Act, 
the 2002 Act or the 2010 Act no subscription tax is due from the Company on the portion of assets 
invested therein. 
19.2 
The Company's income is not taxable in Luxembourg. Income received from the Company may be 
subject to withholding taxes in the country of origin of the issuer of the security, in respect of which 
such income is paid. No duty or tax is payable in Luxembourg in connection with the issue of Shares of 
the Company. 
19.3 
Investors should consult their professional advisors on the possible tax or other consequences of 
buying, holding, redeeming, converting, transferring or selling any units under the laws of their 
countries of citizenship, residence or domicile. 
19.4 
Under current legislation, Shareholders are not subject to any capital gains, income, withholding, 
estate, inheritance or other taxes in Luxembourg, except for (i) those Shareholders domiciled, resident 
or having a permanent establishment in Luxembourg, or (ii) non-residents of Luxembourg who hold 
10% or more of the issued share capital of the Company and who dispose of all or part of their holdings 
within six months from the date of acquisition or (iii) in some limited cases some former residents of 
Luxembourg, who hold 10% or more of the issued share capital of the Company. 
EU Savings Directive 
19.5 
On 3 June 2003, the EU Council of Economic and Finance Ministers adopted the Directive 
2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (the EU Savings Directive). 
The EU Savings Directive is applied by Member States as from I July 2005 and has been implemented 
in Luxembourg by the act of 21 June 2005. 
19.6 
The Company is currently considered by the Luxembourg tax authorities as out of scope the EU 
Savings Directive. However, as the operation of the EU Savings Directive will be reviewed after three 
years, it cannot therefore be excluded that the scope of the EU Savings Directive and/or other articles 
of the EU Savings Directive would be amended at that point in time. Possible (future) EU Savings 
Directive implications should thus be monitored on a continuing basis. 
Other jurisdictions 
19.7 
Interest, dividend and other income realised by the Company on the sale of securities of 
non-Luxembourg issuers, may be subject to withholding and other taxes levied by the jurisdictions in 
which the income is sourced. It is impossible to predict the rate of foreign tax the Company will pay 
since the amount of the assets to be invested in various countries and the ability of the Company to 
reduce such taxes is not known.
