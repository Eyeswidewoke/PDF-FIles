The Luxembourg investigation widens probes of 1MDB =lready under way by authorities in Switzerland, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Hong =ong and Abu Dhabi. Swiss authorities said in January that 1MDB-related losses from 
misappropriation could reach $4 billion. The=Luxembourg prosecutor said its case was connected to the investigation in 
=witzerland. 
1MDB was created to invest in local energy and real=estate projects to boost the Malaysian economy. 
The fund amassed $11 billi=n in debt which it has struggled to repay. Last July, The Wall Street Journal reported that 
almost $700 million was transferred =o Mr. Najib's bank accounts via a web of entities, money which investi=ators 
believe originated with 1MDB. 1MDB has denied sending money to Mr. N=jib's accounts and denied wrongdoing and 
said it is cooperating with probes. 
Edmond de Rothschild Group had (EURO)150 billion ($=70.8 billion) of assets and 2,700 employees as of 
June 30. The bank was st=rted by Edmond de Rothschild in Paris in 1953. Benjamin de Rothschild succeeded his father as 
head of the group in 1997. Last year= Benjamin appointed his wife, Ariane, chairwoman of the executive committe=. 
The Luxembourg prosecutor said in a statement Thurs=ay that its inquiry is focused on the movement of 
funds through a number o= accounts of offshore companies in Singapore, Switzerland and Luxembourg. The 
investigation centers on the flow of 1MDB money relate= to two bonds the fund issued in May and October 2012. 
1MDB, in a statemen=, said it had not been contacted by authorities in Luxembourg.</=> 
The Luxembourg prosecutor didn't give details o= the bonds but appears to refer to two bonds that 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.=sold for 1MDB in May and October 2012, raising a total of $3.5 billion. A spokesperson for 
Goldman Sachs declined to comment.=u> 
Separately, The U.S. Department of Justice has aske= banks including Deutsche Bank AG and J.P. Morgan 
Chase & Co. for docu=ents related to their interactions with 1MDB, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Officials from the department traveled to=Kuala Lumpur recently to interview the banks, the people said. Neither is = 
focus of the Justice Department's probe, they added. The Department o= Justice and 1MDB didn't immediately respond 
to requests for comment. 
Deutsche Bank, as 1MDB's banker, was involved i= sending $1 billion of the fund's money out of the 
country in 2009, ac=ording to documents that form part of a probe into 1MDB by Malaysia's auditor general. The money 
was meant for a joint venture between 1MDB and = Saudi oil company, but $700 million of the total instead ended up 
being t=ansferred to another company, the documents show. What happened to the fun=s is unclear. J.P. Morgan was 
the banker for 1MDB's joint venture with the Saudi company. Both J.P. Morg=n and Deutsche Bank declined to 
comment.
