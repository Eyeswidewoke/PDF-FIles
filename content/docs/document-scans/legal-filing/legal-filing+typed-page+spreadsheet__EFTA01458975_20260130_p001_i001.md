World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Countries' recent investment performances also allow us to identify the most 
challenging macroeconomic outlooks in the region, led again by Brazil and 
Argentina, but including also the special case of Chile. In the latter, the 
combination of worsening external backdrop and controversial reforms has 
badly affected confidence and investment, but this effect should be partly 
temporary in nature, as policy uncertainties are expected to fade, and macro 
policy is actively helping the recovery in confidence and growth. 
The suboptimal investment performance is also a good indicator of the need 
for a second round of reforms in the region. Unfortunately Mexico has been 
the only country to show a clear determination to push for reforms in a couple 
of specific areas, particularly in the energy sector. By contrast, in Argentina, 
Brazil, and in particular in Venezuela, there has been an increasing intervention 
of some form of state capitalism, with expending governments, increasing 
trade protectionism, and economic controls. This appears to explain the 
observed characteristics of the recent slowdown in the region, particularly 
visible in the industrial sector, and in countries reporting significant increases 
in unit labor costs, typical of a middle income malaise. 
In this regard, recent presidential elections in Argentina provide room for hope. 
The new administration is expected to introduce corrective policies for existing 
macro-imbalances, while bringing Argentina back to international markets 
after a likely resolution of the pending holdouts case. Similarly, a mid-term 
election in Venezuela could bring a more balanced policy making, although the 
risk of a power vacuum should not be disregarded. By contrast, ongoing 
political instability in Brazil is likely to remain a big burden for fiscal adjustment 
and economic performance at least in 2016. A warranted fiscal adjustment has 
been announced, and steps are being taken to reestablish much needed policy 
credibility, but President Rousseff's conviction and power to support these 
policies remain major question marks. 
Low external debt is a plus but fiscal dynamics could worsen fast 
The last several years of ultra-low global interest rates have been a bonus for 
emerging countries and a likely rise in US rates has the potential to create 
further turbulence in capital flows. Similarly, the recent decline in commodity 
prices might prove too strong a test to external balances in producer countries. 
However, low levels of hard currency debt, with Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Mexico 
being actually creditors of the world economy, provide an exceptional buffer 
this time around. Expectations for slow-motion rate normalization in the US are 
another blessing for emerging economies in this cycle. 
This notwithstanding, public debt dynamics show that countries like Brazil, 
Venezuela, and Colombia might face significant increases in their debt levels if 
they fail to reduce their large primary deficits. Furthermore, at current oil prices, 
external conditions in Venezuela remain unsustainable, as a low level of 
reserves barely covers the projected balance of payment deficit of a single year 
under the status quo. Besides, a public debt restructuring appears difficult to 
avoid, with the government being harshly constrained politically by a 
protracted recession with inflation.
