GLIDUS139 Third Lake Capital 
Section 4. Glendower Capital Secondaiy Opportunities Fund IV. LP 
Glendower Capital Secondaiy Opportunities Fund IV. LP 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV, LP 
SOF IV is being established by Glendower Capital as the successor Mid to the SOF Funds to pursue the same 
investment strategy as the SOF Funds in the secondary market and will follow processes established by the Glendower 
SOF Team in the SOF Program.42
Investment Strategy 
In line with the focused and disciplined investment strategy that has generated strong returns in the S0F Funds to date.43
the Fund will target the acquisition, holding and disposition of a diverse portfolio of investments including buyout, growth 
capital, venture capital, special situations, turnaround, mezzanine and distressed opportunities, real estate and 
infrastructure assets on the secondary market. 
The Fund will target globally. but primarily in the U.S. and Europe, three types of investment: 
1. 
Fund Secondaries, the purchase of LP interests in wasting private equity funds: 
2. 
GP-led Secondaries, which can often involve greater complexity than traditional Fund Secondaries, and include 
spin-in/spin-outs, tail-end restructuring, asset liquidations and LP tenders; and 
3. 
Single Asset Deals into individual private equity comparies, either at the time of the original acquisition, or later 
from an investor seeking early liquidity. 
The Manager will primarily allocate capital between these three strategies depending on its assessment of the relative 
attractiveness of the transactions available at any point in time. During the Investment Period the relative weightings of 
each of the three strategies may vary as the Manager's assessment of their relative attractiveness changes. 
The Fund will focus on smaller Fund Secondaries of USS5 million to US$100 million sourced from a mix of small 
institutions, family offices and private investors coupled with the opportunistic pursuit of larger transactions sourced from 
financial institutions, corporate and alternative funds. This will, in the Managers view, enable the Manager to select the 
most attractive investment opportunities on a global basis. 
The Fund will target GP-led Secondaries of US$100 million to US$250 million, focusing on kinds with attractive assets 
managed by fundamentally sound managers who have 'hit a bump in the road,' or have investors who have lost patience 
or changed strategy and are therefore looking for liquidity. The Manager believes it will be one of few Managers who 
have the capabilities to execute such transactions at this size range - most Managers target larger transactions to justify 
the higher level of resources necessary to execute GP-led Secondaries. 
The Fund will opportunistically invest into Single Asset Deals where the Manager believes it has identified a situation 
where its capital can add value to the transaction or help unlock a situation. 
In addition to the three strategies described above. the Fund will have the ability to allocate up to 15% of aggregate 
commitments to select primary fund investments and other opportunities to invest in funds where less than 50% of 
aggregate capital commitments of the relevant fund have been drawn down. 
The Fund will target attractive, risk-adjusted returns in excess of 20% Net IRR (after fees, expenses and carried interest) 
on a portfolio basis."
