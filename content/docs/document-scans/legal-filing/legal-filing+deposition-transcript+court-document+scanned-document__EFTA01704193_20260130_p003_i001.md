An Important Notice Concerning Cardmember Privacy 
This Privacy Notice is addressed to United States holders of personal American Express Charge Cards or accounts, 
Optima Cards or accounts, and other personal credit card accounts that we issue, and to United States holders of business 
charge and credit cards from OPEN: The Small Business Network's from American Express. This Notice explains how we 
collect and safeguard information about you and how to tell us your opt out choices. In this Notice, American Express Travel 
Related Services Company, Inc., American Express Centurion Bank, and American Express Bank, FSB are called °American 
Express; 'we; 'our,' and 'us.' The cards and accounts that we issue are called 'Cards' or 'Card accounts.' Holders of those 
Card accounts are called "Cardmembers' or 'you.' "Affiliates" refers to other companies in the American Express family, 
related to us by common control or ownership. 
What Information Do We Collect? 
We obtain information about you from a variety 
of sources. You provide us with information about 
yourself, for example, by completing Card applications. 
This Includes your name, address, social security 
number, and income and asset information. Your use of 
the Card and your other transactions with us and our 
Affiliates provide us with additional information, such as 
your spending and payment history. 
Other sources, such as credit reporting agencies and 
providers of marketing information, furnish us with 
additional information about your credit history, 
purchasing preferences, and other matters. We also 
obtain information in connection with our efforts to 
protect against fraud. We call all of this information 
'Cardmember Information.' 
What Do We Do with This Information? 
We use Cardmember Information in connection with 
delivering products and services to you. To do this it is 
often necessary to share it with our Affiliates and other 
companies we work with. These include companies that 
manage Card accounts, offer affinity, frequent-user, and 
reward programs, companies that perform marketing 
services and other business operations for us, and 
companies whose products or services are provided as 
a benefit of your Card account. We may also share 
Cardmember Information with other financial 
Institutions with whom we jointly offer products 
and services. And we may disclose it to other third 
parties as permitted by law. For example, we disclose 
Cardmember Information in response to subpoenas, to 
credit reporting agencies, and to help prevent fraud. 
Your Opt Out Choices 
You have 'opt out' choices about offers that may be 
sent to you and how those offers may be delivered to 
you. You may also opt out from certain disclosures of 
Cardmember Information. Your opt out choices and 
how to opt out are explained below. 
Offers for Products and Services of Other 
Companies 
We work with other companies, such as merchants that 
accept the Card, so that you may receive offers for their 
products and services. We use Cardmember 
Information to help make these offers more relevant 
and valuable to you. If you respond to one of these 
offers, the other company will know certain information 
about you, such as your name, that you are a 
Cardmember, and that you met the qualifications 
established for the offer. 
Your Choice: You may opt out from receiving these 
offers by calling us at 800-2974378 or by filling out 
the attached form and returning it to the address on

Card accounts that are applicable only to those accounts.
