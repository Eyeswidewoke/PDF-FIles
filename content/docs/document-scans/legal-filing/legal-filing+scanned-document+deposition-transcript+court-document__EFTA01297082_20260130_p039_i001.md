2014 V.I. LEXIS 45, *; 61 V.I. 13, ** 
information available to this Court, to justify the division of their respective individual 
accounts. 
[7] On July 25, 2012, the Court refused to make a determination on Dr. Wright-Francis' 
show cause motion because it lacked sufficient evidence and ordered the parties to 
commission a CPA supra. The parties failed to comply. As a result, the record is still void 
of evidence of a CPA analysis or recommendation to aid the Court. Kellerhals reports and 
testimony are not helpful in this regard since it was designed for the sole purpose of 
demonstrating waste of assets by Mr. Francis. Notwithstanding, [**29] it appears that the 
parties have approximately the same amount in their funds, or close thereto. Thus, a 
division is ["26] unnecessary and each party is entitled to retain their existing interest in 
their own accounts. 
2 &notable Datinbteson Of The Medical Degree 
[8] Mr. Francis requests equitable distribution of Dr. Wright-Francis' medical degree, which 
was acquired after one (1) year of marriage. The U.S. Virgin Islands has not previously 
decided whether educational or professional degrees constitute marital property.. [HN6] 
Most states hold that an educational degree is not marital property. Courts have 
consistently considered whether one spouse had postponed his or her own career and 
educational goals to support and contribute to the career and educational goals of the 
other spouse. See, Mahoney v. Mahoney, 91 N.J. 488, 453 A.2d 527, 531-32 (1982); In re 
the marriage of Sally K. Olar, 747 P.2d 676, 678 (1987). They also acknowledge the 
injustice that occurs after "a couple collectively works towards the attainment of an 
advanced educational degree or career goal," the expectation of a higher standard of living 
in the future can be frustrated by the dissolution of a marriage. In re the marriage of Sally 
K. 0/ar, 747 P.2d 676, 678 (1987). They also acknowledge that injustice that occurs after 
"a couple collectively works towards the attainment of an advanced educational degree or 
career goal," the expectation of a higher standard of living in the 27] future by the 
dissolution of marriage. In re the marriage of Sally K. O/ar, 747 P2d. 676, 678 (1987). 
2O For the purpose of this Order, education and professional degrees will be used interchangeably. 
[9] [HN7]Many states have compared professional degrees to pension or retirement 
plans when establishing what constitutes marital property. Pension and retirement plans 
entitle an owner to a definite amount at a certain date, which an individual has a 
contractual right to receive. See, Fuentes, 38 V.I. 29, 1997 WL 889532, at *5-6. See also, 
Kikkert v. Kikkert, 88 N.J. 4, 438 A.2d 317 (1981). Professional degrees rely on uncertain 
future events and provide only an expectation of enhanced income. The value of a 
professional degree is speculative and dependent upon the attributes and future choices of 
its possessor to be fairly valued. See, In re the marriage of Sally K. Olar, 747 P.2d 676, 
679-80 (1987). See also, Archer v. Archer, 303 Md. 347, 493 A.2d 1074, 1079 [**30] 
(1985), citing Deering v. Deering, 292 Md. 115, 437 A2d 883 (1981). See also, Mahoney v. 
Mahoney, 91 N.J. 488, 453 A.2d 527, 531-32 (1982). 
New York is the only jurisdiction so far to rule professional degrees are marital property 
subject to equitable distribution. See, O'Brien v. O'Brien, 66 N.Y.2d 576, 498 N.Y.S.2d
