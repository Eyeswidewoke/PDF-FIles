the selected employee was of another race. Without these fundamental facts, we cannot 
["•139] know whether particular promotions decisions raise even a circumstantial 
inference of discrimination. See Cline v. Roadway Express, Inc., 689 F.2d 481, 485 n.4 
(4th Cir. 1982); accord Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. 
Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).

The majority concentrates on one anecdotal comment from one supervisor in the beam 
mill: "I don't think we'll ever have a black supervisor while I'm here." J.A. 1885-86; see also 
maj. op. at 6, 51. That comment could be compelling evidence in a case hinging on 
decisions made by that particular decisionmaker. On the other hand, it might not be, as we 
have discounted "stray or isolated" remarks, even at summary judgment. Brinkley v. 
Harbour Recreation Club, 180 F.3d 598, 608 (4th Cir. 1999); see also Birkbeck v. Marvel 
Lighting Corp., 30 F.3d 507, 511-12 (4th Cir. 1994) (finding that decisionmaker's singular 
remark did not evidence discriminatory practices at company). 
In the end, the question proves academic. A class-wide claim challenging decisions made 
by many different decisionmakers plainly requires something more than a single comment 
from just one of them. We see this rule -- that sparse comments are not enough for class 
treatment — illustrated in cases like King v. General Electric Company, 960 F.2d 617 (7th 
Cir. 1992). There, the Seventh Circuit found that the plaintiffs' anecdotal evidence in an 
age-discrimination case was not enough, even though the record contained testimony from 
a higher manager that the company was "going to get rid of these old farts ("140] and get 
some new blood in here." Id. at 628 (Cudahy, J., dissenting) (summarizing evidence 
rejected by the majority). This Court, too, has rejected anecdotal evidence of a similarly 
"damning character," this time in a racial discrimination case. See Coker v. Charleston 
Cnty. Sch. Dist., No. 92-1589, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 20836, 1993 WL 309580, at *6 (4th 
Cir. Aug. 16, 1993). We found that the plaintiffs had not established a policy or practice of 
discrimination despite testimony that a black principal was told the community would not 
"accept" him at a predominantly white school.1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 20836 [WL] at '4. All 
this goes to illustrate that plaintiffs likely cannot prove a class-wide policy with a single 
comment, no matter how bigoted the comment may be. One comment certainly does not 
make the showing that Plaintiffs insist they make here: a common, uniform policy of 
animus inflicted by 55 or more independent supervisors upon more than 150 employees 
scattered throughout a multi-department plant. Consequently, the district court did not 
abuse its discretion in refusing to certify Plaintiffs' class based on a single comment.

The district court also gave "limited weight" to almost 80 affidavits from black ('951] 
employees at the Nucor plant. J.A. 10950. The affidavits consistently rejected the idea of 
discrimination in the promotions process, [".141] and the district court did not abuse its 
discretion in affording them some minimal value. Repeatedly, the affidavits suggest that 
the promotions process was fair. See, e.g., J.A. 6024, 6042, 6052, 6069, 6078. One such 
employee specifically remarked that "[n]ot all African-Americans feel like they have been
