arou=d the country, regardless of race, almost entirely from families who make =ess than $55,000 a year. Applicants are 
required to be in the top 10 perce=t of their class, having taken the most difficult courses their schools offer. The 60 who 
gain entry to t=e program each year spend the summer before 12th grade at Princeton, study=ng ethics, political theory 
and public policy, and preparing for standardi=ed college entrance exams. 
In a wondrous righting of=the current disequilibrium, however small its scale, they are tutored for =hose tests by the 
same instructors who work with some of Manhattan's wealthiest teenagers: the staff of Advantage Testing, whose 
=ervices cost parents up to $795 an hour. Arun Alagappan, the founder and p=esident of Advantage and a major 
benefactor of LEDA, provides his employee= (whose résumés typically resemble those of the people at Google or 
McKinsey) pro bono. 
LEDA has been very succes=ful. Of the 500 or so students who have graduated from the program, three =uarters have 
gone on to top-tier colleges, 30 percent of them to the Ivy League. Among LEDA's 2012 graduates alone, 19 gained 
adm=ssion to Princeton, 11 to Georgetown and 6 to the University of Pennsylvan=a. 
Last week I took a walk a=ound Red Hook, Brooklyn, with Joshua El-Bey, a LEDA graduate who was leavi=g in a few days 
for his sophomore year at Yale. His family struggled as he grew up, moving often and ultimately landing in the Red Ho=k 
Houses, the borough's largest public housing development. His first me=ories of book learning, he told me, were the 
readings his mother delivered=from Genesis when he was 2. What was disconcerting about Mr. El-Bey's otherwise 
incredibly inspiring traj=ctory was how much of his success had depended on opportunities outside th= public education 
system. 
Bullied in middle school =or his studiousness, Mr. El-Bey hoped to gain admission to one of the city=92s elite specialized 
public high schools, but he did not do well enough on the entrance exam. The free tutoring provided by the city f=r the 
test was insufficient, he said. 
He ended up at Edward R. =urrow in Midwood, Brooklyn, a good school whose academics were nevertheles= surpassed 
by the supplemental training he received as a scholar at Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, an organization begun 50 
=ears ago by Manhattan lawyers and advertising executives as a mentoring pr=gram to get poor minority students into 
good colleges. Today it essentiall= provides a shadow education. In school, Mr. El-Bey told me, he simply learned to 
"regurgitate facts."<=span> 
Programs like LEDA and 5.=.O. are popular with wealthy, supremely educated donors, precisely because=of outcomes 
like Mr. El-Begs. Just this May, the financier Henry R. Kravis pledged $4 million in matching gifts to S.E.O. 
And in a city as dense wi=h talent and money as New York, the effects of such philanthropy can be ef=ortlessly observed. 
Walking through his neighborhood, Mr. El-Bey ran into another alumnus of S.E.O., Luis Hernandez, who was about t=
