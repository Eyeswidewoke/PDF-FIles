2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
immediately sought to collect the funds owed. Thus, the circumstances of this case could 
give rise to a duty to disclose the information at issue. See First Ala. Bank of Montgomery, 
899 F.2d at 1059 (concluding that, despite the fact that the plaintiff was a sophisticated 
financial institution, its insurer owed a duty to disclose under the particular circumstances 
of the case, including the insurer's superior knowledge regarding the dealings at issue); 
Independent life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Harrington, 658 So. 2d 892, 896-97 (Ala. 1995) 
(concluding that, under the circumstances of the case, including the plaintiffs reliance on 
the defendant's superior knowledge, the defendant owed a duty to disclose). 
20 The parties have not provided the Court with any information regarding the customs of the trade with respect to this issue. 
Therefore, the urdersigned cannot make a determination as to whether the fifth factor supports a duty in this ['SS] case. 
Because the Plaintiff has alleged that BIC had a duty to disclose Specialty's poor financial 
condition and the lack of fuel oil securing plaintiff's transactions with Specialty, that BIC 
failed to disclose those facts, that BIC solicited the Plaintiff to enter into purchase 
agreements with Specialty, and that the Plaintiff sustained serious financial losses as a 
result of those transactions, the Plaintiff has stated a claim against BIC for suppression. 
Therefore, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that BIC's motion to dismiss should be denied 
with respect to Plaintiffs suppression claim. 
b. Suppression claim against BTU and Brito. 
With respect to BTU and Brito, the Plaintiff did not allege a confidential relationship or 
special circumstances giving rise to a duty on the part of BTU and Brito to disclose its poor 
financial condition or the status of fuel oil securing the purchase agreements with the 
Plaintiff. (Compare doc. 64, ¶ 72, with id., ¶¶ 68-77.) Furthermore, the Plaintiff asserts no 
argument in that regard." (See doc. 73 at 22-23.) Instead, the Plaintiff argues that BTU's 
and Brito's duty to disclose arose from a criminal statute--section 13A-9-48 of the Code of 
Alabama. (Doc. 73 at 23.) As discussed p54] below, the Plaintiffs reliance on a criminal 
statute is unconvincing. While the Plaintiff concedes that section 13A-9-48 does not give 
rise to a private right of action, it argues that the statute, nevertheless, imposes a duty 
satisfying a critical element in the Plaintiffs fraudulent suppression claim brought pursuant 
to section 6-5-102. (Doc. 73 at 23.) The Plaintiff provides no authority supporting this 
argument, and the undersigned does not find it persuasive. See infra § 
21 The undersigned notes that. lvdhen the parties to a transaction deal with each other at arm's length, with no confidential 
relationship, no obligation to disclose information arises when the information is not requested.-  Freightliner. 932 So. 2d at 892 
(citing Meson v. Chrysler Corp.. 653 So. 2d 951, 954-56 (Na. 1995)). 
Nevertheless, the undersigned finds that a duty for BTU and Brito to disclose the facts at 
issue could arise from BTU and Brito's alleged misleading representations. See CNH Am., 
LLC v. Ligon Capital, LLC, 160 So. 3d 1195, 1111204, 2013 WL 5966782, at *5 (Ala. 
2013) (1Oince a party elects to speak, he or she assumes a duty not to suppress or 
conceal those facts that materially qualify the facts already stated."' (quoting Freightliner, 
932 So. 2d at 895)). The Plaintiff alleges that, by May 2012, Specialty's financial condition
