POWER CONNECTIONS 
Before installing the amplifier, disconnect the 
negative (ground) wire from the vehicle's battery. 
This will prevent accidental damage to the system, 
the vehicle and your body during installation.

„o( 
XO6OO/1 
The XD600/1's "+12 VDC" and "Ground" 
connections are designed to accept 4 AWG 
power wire. 4 AWG is the required wire size for 
this amplifier. 
If you are installing the XD600/1 with other 
amplifiers and wish to use a single main power 
wire, use 2. AWG or 1/0 AWG main power wire 
(depending on the overall current demands of all 
the amplifiers in the system). This 2 AWG or 
1/0 AWG power wire should terminate into a 
fused distribution block mounted as close to 
the amplifiers as possible (within 12 inches / 
30cm of wire length). The fused output of the 
distribution block will connect to the XD600/1 
with 4 AWG power wire. JL Audio ECS 
fused distribution blocks are recommended 
(XD-FDBU-2 and XD-FDBU-4) 
Note: Smaller AWG numbers mean bigger 
wire and vice-versa (1/0 AWG is the largest, 2 
AWG is smaller, then 4 AWG, then 8 AWG, etc.). 
To connect the power wires to the amplifier, 
first back out the set screw on the top of the 
terminal block, using the supplied 2.5 mm hex 
wrench. Strip 1/2 inch (12 mm) of insulation from 
the end of each wire and insert the bare wire into 
the terminal block, seating it firmly so that no 
bare wire is exposed. While holding the wire in 
place, tighten the set screw firmly, taking care not 
to strip the head of the screw. 
The ground connection should be made 
using 4 AWG wire and should be kept as short 
as possible, while accessing a solid piece of sheet 
metal in the vehicle. The surface of the sheet 
metal should be sanded at the contact point 
to create a clean, metal-to-metal connection 
between the chassis and the termination of 
the ground wire. For optimal grounding, we 
recommend the use of a JL Audio ECS master 
ground lug (XB-MGLU). Alternatively, a sheet 
metal screw or bolt can be used with a star 
washer. 
Any wires run through metal barriers (such 
as firewalls), must be protected with a high 
quality rubber grommet to prevent damage to the 
insulation of the wire. Failure to do so may result 
in a dangerous short circuit. 
IIIMPORTANT_I
Many vehicles employ small (10 AWG 
6 AWG) wire to ground the battery to the 
vehicle chassis and to connect the alternator's 
positive connection to the battery. To prevent 
voltage drops, these wires should be upgraded 
to 4 AWG when installing amplifier systems 
with main fuse ratings above 60A. 
FUSE REQUIREMENTS 
It is absolutely vital that the main power 
wire(s) to the amplifier(s) in the system be 
fused within 18 inches (45 cm) of the positive 
battery post connection. The fuse value at each 
power wire should be high enough for all of the 
equipment being run from that power wire. If 
only the XD600/1 is being run from that power 
wire, use a 50A fuse. 
If fusing the amplifier near its power 
connections (when more than one amp is being 
run from the main power wire), use a 50A fuse 
(MAXI" big plastic-body fuse is recommended).
