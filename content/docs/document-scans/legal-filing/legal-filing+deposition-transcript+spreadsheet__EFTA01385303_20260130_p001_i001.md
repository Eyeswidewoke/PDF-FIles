Macro - Global GDP to be up modestly in 2018 
The global macro economy is expected to see modestly stronger growth in 
2018 as compared to 2017. DB's Global Economics team forecasts global GDP 
will increase 3.8% in '18 versus 3.7% in '17. By region, the fastest growth is 
forecast in China at 6.3% followed by Asia ex-Japan at 6.0% and the U.S. at 
2.6%. Faster progress on tax reform bills in the U.S. and the EU-UK exit deal 
provided the most recent positive catalysts to growth in 2017. They added to a 
favorable backdrop of strong economic growth, increasingly supportive fiscal 
and regulatory policy, and tightening but still easy monetary policy. The DB 
Global Economics team expects the positive environment to extend into 2018, 
as the global economy should expand at a strong pace, with the U.S. and 
Eurozone growing above potential and China slowing down, but only 
moderately. Political risk, though still present, shouldn't escalate. We expect 
central banks exit from ultra-accommodative monetary policy to continue very 
gradually. The greatest challenges to this outlook are sharp inflation and China 
growth.

Chemicals End-Markets: Global auto sales expected to rise 
in '18 at a similar rate as in '17 
Global auto sales are projected to grow 2.4% in 2018 y/y to 97.5 MM units 
versus 2.3% growth in '17. '17 was a mixed bag with strong growth in India, 
Russia, LatAm and Japan, along with marginal gains in China and Europe, 
offset by a decline in North America. 
• 
North America: For '18, Deutsche Bank's Auto Research team estimates 
U.S. light vehicle sales will total 16.7 MM (-1.8% y/y), following a -2.6% 
decline in '17. The U.S. light vehicle market reached peak demand in '16 
following a six year recovery, as key drivers were low interest rates and 
higher lease penetration, before showing modest declines in '17. Despite 
an outlook calling for modest declines again in '18, the overall environment 
appears benign, but cyclical concerns could return. 
• 
Europa: Deutsche Bank's Auto team expects modest growth for light 
vehicle sales in '18 following decent growth in '17 with 17.9 MM units 
expected in '18 (+1.5% yly) as compared to 17.6 MM units for '17 (+3.0% 
y/y). Growth in '17 led to the first-full year above replacement demand in 
Western Europe. Italy and Spain realized the strongest growth, while the 
UK was down y/y due to Brexit. Demand is expected to realize only a 
marginal gain in '18 with the UK again showing the biggest decline.
