Lastly, Iran could choose to delay the breakout until the Syrian civil war =s stabilized. Hezbollah, its main proxy against 
Israel, is currently parti=ipating in the conflict on the regime's side. Should Israel undertake a mi=itary operation against 
the nuclear facilities at the current time, Iran w=uld need to decide whether Hezbollah should focus on the Syrian civil 
war =r a reprisal attack on Israel. By delaying the breakout until Hezbollah on=e again can focus its firepower on its 
southern enemy, Iran's deterrence v=s-a-vis Israel would be restored. 
If Iran's goal is to have the ability to produce nuclear weapons sometime i= the future, it has several incentives to make 
concessions in the ongoing =egotiations with the P5+1 countries. Careful thought should be given to wh=t Iran's 
breakout strategy might be—and how to obstruct it.

Iran's diplomacy shows a recognition of its decline 
Katerina Dalacoura 
October 20 - Iran's positive attitude in its negotiations with the US, Br=tain, France, Germany, China and Russia over its 
nuclear programme marks a=clear shift in policy. 
This welcome development, seen during the past week in talks in Geneva, fol=ows Tehran's willingness to go along with 
the Russian-initiated deal on =hemical weapons in Syria — where Iran is backing the Assad regime. The l=lamic Republic 
appears to be softening its longstanding policies in favour=of a more conciliatory approach. The shift is caused by the 
country's lo=g-term decline in the Middle East — and Tehran's recognition that it m=st act on this decline. Iran's stance 
will hold the key to a number of i=terlocking regional conflicts, so identifying its cause helps shape policy=responses to 
it. High quality global journalism requires investment. Pleas= share this article with others using the link below, do not 
cut & paste t=e article. If an agreement with Iran does come to pass, many will argue th=t economic sanctions, imposed 
by the UN Security Council, the EU and the U=, have achieved their objective. President Hassan Rouhani was elected 
this=year with a mandate to ease the economic plight of his people. Ali Khamene=, the supreme leader, has at least 
partly conceded that the country needs =o achieve this by proffering an olive branch to the international communit=, 
and the US in particular. But the economic factor is only part of a bigg=r picture. 
Iran is slowly but perceptibly losing the struggle for power in the Middle =ast. The messages it has propagated in various 
forms since the 1979 revolu=ion are sounding tired and losing popularity at home and abroad. Its attem=ts to lead anti-
western and anti-Israeli resistance fail to excite as they=used to. The Sunni-Shia conflict, which now seems to permeate 
the politics=of the region, has reduced Shia Iran to the status of a sectarian power. A=atollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the 
leader of the revolution whose vision was o= Iran at the forefront of the entire Islamic world, would be turning in hi= 
grave. 
The Assad regime is being shaken to its foundations. If it falls, the core =f Iran regional policy — which rests on its 
decades-long alliance with S=ria — will disintegrate. Admittedly, Iran's position in Nouri al-Malik='s Iraq is assured —
although that regime is being rocked by an almost=daily string of murderous attacks. 
But Iran's failing fortunes in the region should not be gauged only in ma=erial terms. Its bid for regional leadership has 
never rested solely on su=h crude measures. At its core was a self-appointed role as Islamic champio= of the anti-
western camp, forged in the 1979 revolution. It is on this mo=t crucial ideological front that Iran is losing out. 
The Arab uprisings of 2011 revealed this most poignantly to anyone in Tehra= who cared to look. When the revolts 
broke out, the Iranian leadership hop=d that they signified a popular turn to Islamism as they understood it. Ho=ever, it 
soon became clear that the rebellious youth were neither driven b= an anti-western animus nor by a desire for an 
Islamist system. In Egypt a=d Tunisia, Islamist movements capitalised on the fall of presidents Hosni =ubarak and Zine al-
Abidine Ben Ali. However, even in these countries (espe=ially Egypt), their popularity declined rapidly. 
As the impact of the Arab uprisings reverberated through the Middle East, t=e Islamic Republic continued to lose out. 
The Assad regime's brutal tact=cs have delegitimised it in the eyes of many in the region, even those who=had 
sympathised with its longstanding anti-western, anti-Israeli stand. Hi=bollah's support of the Assad regime has similarly 
dented its legitimacy= Gone are the days when Hassan Nasrallah, its secretary-general, was the h=ro of the Arab street —
