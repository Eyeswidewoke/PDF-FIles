companies that would otherwise be considering self-insurance as a means of reducing insurance 
expense, especially if the tax law of the home jurisdiction permits the deduction ofpremiums paid 
to captives. 
While an exempt company is the preferred corporate vehicle for establishing a foreign (non-U.S.) 
owned exempt Insurance Company in the U.S. Virgin Islands, an exempt insurer may also be 
established by a United States person using a standard U.S. Virgin Islands corporation. However, 
it should be noted that changes in federal tax law in the 1980's, and the imposition of an excise tax 
on insurance premiums paid by United States persons to foreign insurers, have made it much more 
difficult for United States companies to take advantage of the tax benefits for which captive 
insurance companies were traditionally created. 
Offshore Investment Companies - General Applications for United States Virgin Islands Exempt 
Companies 
Aside from the specialized areas of banking and insurance discussed above, there arc many other 
applications for U.S. Virgin Islands exempt companies. A U.S. Virgin Islands exempt company 
should generally be utilized, rather than an offshore entity formed in another jurisdiction, when 
United States flag protection is either desirable or essential to the purposes of the company, so 
long as the exempt company ownership requirements can be met. 
For example, foreign persons who want to register their aircraft with the United States Federal 
Aviation Administration in order to obtain an "N" registration number, must use an entity 
incorporated in the United States as the ownership vehicle and the entity must be controlled by 
United States persons. The only United States incorporated entity that is not subject to U.S. income 
tax is a Virgin Islands exempt company, making it an ideal choice for this purpose. In order to meet 
the domestic control requirement of the Federal Aviation Administration regulations, a voting trust 
is usually created to hold the stock of the aircraft- owning exempt company. 
Another use for a Virgin Islands exempt company is as a holding company for assets located in a 
foreign country where there is a fear that the assets might be expropriated by an unfriendly 
government. Holding such assets through an exempt company would protect them from 
expropriation under United States laws and treaties. 
In various situations a foreign person may wish to obtain the benefits of a treaty of friendship, 
comnerce and navigation ("FCN treaty") entered into between the United States and a third 
country. Prior to the availability of U.S. Virgin Islands exempt companies, such benefits could only 
be obtained by establishing a domestic corporation in one of the United States and suffering the 
attendant U.S. tax consequences. However, United States FCN treaties apply to the United States 
Virgin Islands (and companies incorporated there) -- but not to any other jurisdiction where 
beneficial tax exemptions are available. Therefore a non-American investor may establish an 
exempt company in the United States Virgin Islands to take advantage of the United States FCN 
treaty with a third country while avoiding any United States or U.S. Virgin Islands tax 
consequences. 
Another use for an exempt company is where there is a desire to have access to United States
