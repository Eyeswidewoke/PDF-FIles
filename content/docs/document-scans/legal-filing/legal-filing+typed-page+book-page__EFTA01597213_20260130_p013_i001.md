may be denied if there are insufficient assets in your account to make full payment for any 
Card transactions as they are processed. 
As your Card cash withdrawals are processed, we will deduct funds from your Account to 
reimburse the Card Issuer. Once each calendar month, we will deduct from your Account 
the amount of purchases made with the Card that have been received by the Card Issuer 
but not yet deducted from your Account. The Card Issuer may suspend or cancel Cards if 
there are insufficient assets to cover transactions. 
Insurance Accounts 
As a service to clients, we also offer accounts to maintain or permit the purchase of 
insurance products and services. By signing the Signature Page for your non-brokerage 
insurance account, you accept the Client Relationship Agreement and the other documents 
referred to here, and as a result, you may be able to open brokerage accounts with us in 
the future without having to sign additional agreements. 
Joint Accounts 
For joint accounts, each person or entity named on the Account has full power and 
authority over the Account, and the account holders are jointly and severally liable for all 
obligations with respect to the Account. Please refer to the "Joint Accounts" section of the 
General Terms and Conditions for more information about the terms and conditions that 
apply to joint accounts. 
When we open additional joint accounts for the same account holders, we establish them 
with the same legal ownership as the most recently-opened joint account, unless we are 
instructed otherwise. If you request a different form of ownership, we will request your 
signature acknowledging that election. For example, if you open an account as joint 
tenants with rights of survivorship, your next account with the same parties will also be 
established as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, unless you tell us you want a 
different type of ownership for that account. 
Margin Agreement and Margin Requirements 
All Accounts that you open now or in the future will be established with margin, if eligible, 
unless you instruct us that you do not want margin privileges for specific Accounts. By 
signing the Signature Page for any Account except for an ERISA Plan or for an Estate, you 
agree that the Margin Agreement governs your use of margin in all of your current 
Accounts and any Accounts that you may open in the future. 
Therefore, if you do not establish margin privileges when you open an Account and later 
decide to use margin, you may be able to do so without signing additional forms. Likewise, 
if you cancel your margin privileges on an Account, your margin agreement with us will 
remain in effect and you may request to use margin again at any time. In either event, we 
will confirm your request. 
When you use your margin privileges, we hold your securities in your Account as collateral 
against the amounts you borrow, and your securities may be loaned to UBS or to others as 
described in the Margin Agreement. In addition, margin-eligible Accounts are subject to 
applicable statutes, rules, regulations, procedures or industry customs. We may deem it 
necessary or advisable to establish additional requirements for margin accounts. You agree 
to maintain sufficient assets to satisfy all applicable statutes, rules or regulations, or as we 
deem necessary or advisable. You also agree to maintain sufficient assets in your Account 
to satisfy any and all margin calls issued in connection with the Account. 
As long as your Account is a margin account, you authorize UBS in the usual course of 
business to lend, pledge as collateral, hypothecate, relend or repledge any Property we 
carry for you on margin, whether separately or together with Property of others, either to 
ourselves or to others. This authorization remains in effect until we receive payment for 
such Property. 
When you use your margin privileges, as permitted by law, we may use certain securities in 
your account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending securities for short 
sales. We may receive and retain compensation in connection with such transactions. If
