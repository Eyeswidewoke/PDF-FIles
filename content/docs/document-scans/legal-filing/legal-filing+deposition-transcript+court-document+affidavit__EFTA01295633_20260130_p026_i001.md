785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
(citing Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160-61, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 
740 (1982)). But as the Court later clarified, "Rule 23 grants courts no license to engage in 
free-ranging ["15] merits inquiries at the certification stage." Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. 
Plans & Trust Funds, 
U.S. , 133 S. Ct. 1184, 1194-95, 185 L. Ed. 2d 308 (2013). 
Instead, the merits of a claim may be considered only when "relevant to determining 
whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied." Id. at 1195.5
5 The Wal-Mart majority confronted a split among courts regarding the depth of review necessary to sustain class certification 
under Rule 23. See Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores. Inc.. 603 F.3d 571. 582-84 (9th Cir. 2010). rev'cl. 131 S. Ct. 2541. 180 L. Ed. 2d 
374 (2011) (describing the split between circuits): Wal-Mart. 131 S. Ct. at 2551.52. On one end of the spectrum. a number of 
courts liberally construed the Supreme Court's language in Eisen v. Carlisle 8 Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156.94 S. Ct. 2140. 40 L. 
Ed. 2d 732 0974), stating that "nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 . 
gives a court any authority to conduct a 
preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action." 417 U.S. at 
177. On the other end, many courts, including this Circuit, heeded the Supreme Court's later call for a "rigorous analysis," as 
announced in Falcon. See 457 U.S. at 160. As Falcon held. "sometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the 
pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question." Id. 
This Court's precedent and its approach in Brown I are consistent with Wal-Mart and 
Falcon. See Gariety v. Grant Thornton, LLP, 368 F.3d 356, 366 (4th Cir. 2004) (observing 
that [FINS] "while an evaluation of the merits to determine the strength of the plaintiffs' 
("16] case is not part of a Rule 23 analysis, the factors spelled out in Rule 23 must be 
addressed through findings, even if they overlap with issues on the merits"). In Brown I, 
this Court expressly invoked Falcon's requirement of a rigorous analysis to determine 
compliance with Rule 23. 576 F.3d at 152. More important, of course, we actually 
conducted such an analysis, providing a detailed evaluation of the workers' anecdotal and 
statistical evidence to ensure that it presented a common question under Rule 23(a)(2). Id. 
at 153-56. 
Contrary to the dissent's assertion, we do not (and Brown I did not) suggest that [HN9] 
Rule 23 is a mere pleading standard. See post at 92. Far from it. It is true that Brown I 
cautioned that "an in--depth assessment of the merits of appellants' claim at this stage 
would be improper." Id. at 156. Such a statement, however, is consistent with the Supreme 
Court's dictate in Amgen that a court should engage the merits of a claim only to the extent 
necessary to verify that Rule 23 has been satisfied. Amgen, 133 S. Ct. at 1194-95. Brown I 
did precisely that. 
1. 
Even evaluated in a still more painstaking manner, the workers' statistical evidence is 
methodologically sound while yielding results that satisfy Wal-Mart's heightened 
requirement of commonality discussed below. The parties' (**17] central dispute concerns 
the data used to analyze the period from December 1999 to January 2001, when Nucor 
failed to retain actual bidding records. For that period, the workers' expert developed an 
alternative benchmark that uses 27 relevant 'change-of-status' forms -- filled out when an 
employee ['9O4] changes positions at the plant -- to extrapolate promotions data because 
actual bidding information was unavailable. 
[I-IN10) Of course, it belabors the obvious to observe that the alternative benchmark is a 
less precise measure than actual bidding data. It is also clear, however, that plaintiffs may
