2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
6 See Emps. Ins. of Wausau v. Granite State ins. Co.. 330 F.3d 1214. 1220 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that federal courts "may 
consider unpublished state decisions. even though such opinions have no precedential value"). 
Upon further examination, however, the outcome is less clear-cut. In Washington, the test 
for applying the statute of frauds is whether a contract "cannot be performed within one 
year from its making." Winslow v. MeII, 48 Wn.2d 581, 295 P.2d 319, 322 (Wash. 1956) 
(emphasis added). Courts "will examine the surrounding circumstances to ascertain the 
terms of the contract and to determine whether, by those terms, the contract must of 
necessity require more than one year to perform." Id.; see also Gronvold v. Whaley, 39 
Wn.2d 710, 237 P.2d 1026, 1030 (Wash. 1951) ("We merely look[] to the circumstances to 
ascertain whether the events required by the terms of the contract could not ['26] possibly 
take place within a year."). 'That the contract was not performed within a year is of no 
significance; nor does it matter that it was highly improbable that the contract could be 
performed within one year." Gronvold, 237 P.2d at 1030. 
Here, Mr. Steadman's loan permits him to prepay the amount due. (See Note ¶ 4.) As 
such, it may be possible, albeit improbable, that the contract could be performed within 
one year. See Wells Fargo Bank v. Main, 160 Wash. App. 1005, at *3 [published in full-text 
format at 2011 Wash. App. LEXIS 369] (2011) (finding that a loan for $103,000.00 was 
exempt from the statute of frauds because it was possible, no matter how improbable, that 
it could be paid back within one year); Gronvold, 237 P.2d at 1031-32 ("Although it 
appears highly improbable that the contract could be performed within one year, we cannot 
say that the terms of the contract made performance impossible within that period; 
therefore it is our opinion that this contract is not void.") Therefore, the court turns to the 
second basis for applying the statute of frauds.' 
7 Because, at the end of the day, the statute of frauds is applicable to the loan modification under both theories, the court does 
not address the interplay between the theories. 
The second reason Mr. Steadman's loan falls within the statute of frauds is that it is an 
encumbrance on real property. p27] RCW 64.04.010; RCW 64.04.020; Algaier v. CMG 
Mon., Inc., No. 13-CV-0380-TOR, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112363, 2014 WL 3965180, at 
*7 (E. D. Wash. Aug. 13, 2014) (finding that a loan secured by real property falls within the 
statute of frauds under Washington law because it is an encumbrance on real property); 
Turning Point Cmty. Church of God in Christ, 152 Wash. App. 1014, at *34 [published in 
full-text format at 2009 Wash. App. LEXIS 2336] (same). Although the doctrine of part 
performance is applicable, Mr. Steadman's evidence of part performance is insufficient to 
remove the alleged modification from the operation of the statute. 
"Where specific performance of [an] agreement is sought, the contract must be proven by 
evidence that is clear and unequivocal and which leaves no doubt as to the terms, 
character, and existence of the contract." Berg, 886 P.2d at 571. Courts consider three 
elements to determine if there has been part performance of the agreement so as to 
remove it from the statute of frauds: "(1) delivery and assumption of actual and exclusive 
possession; (2) payment or tender of consideration; and (3) the making of permanent,
