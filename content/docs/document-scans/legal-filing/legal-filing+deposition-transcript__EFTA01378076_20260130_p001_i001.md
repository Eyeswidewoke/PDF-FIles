amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due December 15, 2022 (2012 Senior Notes"), respectively. The 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed 
by Match Group. Inc. and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. 
The indentures governing the 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the ability of IAC's restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, 
(i) incur indebtedness, make investments, or sell assets in the event IAC is not in compliance with the financial ratio set forth in the indenture, and (ii) incur 
liens, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, enter into transactions with afflhates and consolidate, merge or sell all or 
substantially all of our assets. At September 30. 2015, IAC was in compliance with the financial ratio set forth in the indenture. 
On December 21. 2012. IAC entered into a $300 million revolving credit facikty. On October 7, 2015, the IAC revolving credit facility was amended and 
restated, and now expires on October 7, 2020. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there are no outstanding borrowings under IAC's revolving 
Credit facility. The revolving credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the same domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes and 
is also secured by the stock of Match Group. Inc. and certain of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. 
The Company has not recorded a liability pursuant to this guarantor obligation because we have not agreed to pay a specific amount through an arrangement 
with our co-obligors and we do not expect to pay any amount as a result of our guarantee of IAC's Senior Notes and IAC's revolving credit facility. Prior to the 
closing of this offering, we will no longer be a restricted subsidiary of IAC for purposes of its debt facildies, nor will we guarantee any debt of IAC nor will the 
stock of any of our subsidiaries be pledged to secure IAC's debt.
