I wanted to add to his letter, to reiterate our concern a</=ont>bout how your office 
was planning to follow up on the false and defamatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because this was initiated 
by an on=ine entertainment news outlet with a clear agenda and established record of propagating false allegations 
about me, rather than by any of the individuals they refer to as sources, this should not=be considered a credible 
allegation worthy of investigation. I beli=ve that our initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. Whether =r not 
you agree with this, there are two thi=gs I think are important to establish. 
F=rstly, that the University should not propagate what can be false allegations from such 
a source by presenting them directly to current and/or former employees or to others. To do so would be to further 
their libelous=20 agenda, as Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard,o cur=ent or former employees about this in 
the process of carrying out and concluding your investigation. 
your client,=Lawrence Krauss, copied me on his February 23rd email communication to 
the Office of Equity and Inclusion. I am writing to=20 convey the University's position on its responsibility to conduct=20 
administrative investigations into allegations of conduct that would violate institutional policy, if true. Because Dr. 
Krauss has retained legal counsel, I am writing directly to you. You may forward m= communication on to your client. 
Without having first secured your permission, I did not think it was proper for me to copying him =n this reply.
