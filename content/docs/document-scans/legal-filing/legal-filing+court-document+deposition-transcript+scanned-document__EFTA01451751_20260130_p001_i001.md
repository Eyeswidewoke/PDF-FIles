SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
(b) 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise applicable 
provision of law or equity, to the fullest extent permitted by law, whenever in this Agreement the 
General Partner or Investment Manager is permitted or required to make a decision (i) in its "sole 
discretion" or in its "discretion" or under a similar grant of authority or latitude, the General 
Partner or Investment Manager shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it 
desires, and may consider its own interests and shall have no duty or obligation to give any 
consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Partnership or the Limited Partners, or 
(ii) in its "good faith" or under another express standard, to the fullest extent permitted by 
applicable law, the General Partner or Investment Manager shall act under such express standard 
and shall not be subject to any other or different standard. 
Section 9.03. 
Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the 
Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Indemnified Persons from and against 
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, fines, taxes and interest and penalties 
thereon, claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings (whether civil, criminal, administrative, 
investigative or otherwise), costs, expenses and disbursements (including legal and accounting 
fees and expenses, costs of investigation and sums paid in settlement) of any kind or nature 
whatsoever and howsoever arising (collectively, "Claims and Expenses") which may be 
imposed on, incurred by or asserted at any time against such Indemnified Person in any way 
related to or arising out of this Agreement, the Partnership, the Master Fund or the management 
or administration of the Partnership or in connection with the business or affairs of the 
Partnership or the activities of such Indemnified Person on behalf of the Partnership (including 
serving on any committee of the Master Fund); provided that no Indemnified Person shall be 
entitled to indemnification hereunder if it shall have been determined by a final judgment of a 
court of competent jurisdiction that the Claims and Expenses are primarily attributable to such 
Person's fraud, willful misfeasance or gross negligence. This Section 9.03 should not be 
construed as indemnifying, or attempting to indemnify, the Investment Manager against any 
liability (including liability under United States federal securities laws which under certain 
circumstances impose liability on Persons who act in good faith) to the extent, but only to the 
extent, indemnifying the Investment Manager would be in violation of applicable law. 
Section 9.04. 
Advancement of Expenses. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable 
law, the Partnership shall pay the expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses and 
costs of investigation) incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending any claim, demand, 
action, suit or proceeding as such expenses are incurred by such Indemnified Person and in 
advance of the final disposition of such matter, provided that such Indemnified Person 
undertakes to repay such expenses if it is determined by a final judgment of a court of competent 
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section 
9.03. 
Section 9.05. 
Notice of Proceedings. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person 
of notice of the commencement of any proceeding against such Indemnified Person, such 
Indemnified Person shall, if a claim for indemnification in respect thereof is to be made against 
the Partnership, give written notice to the General Partner (or, if the Indemnified Person is the 
General Partner, then to the Investment Manager) of the commencement of such proceeding, 
provided that the failure of an Indemnified Person to give notice as provided herein shall not 
relieve the Partnership of its obligations under Sections 9.03 and 9.04, except to the extent that
