Periodically we are required by industry regulators to send records of certain personal 
and financial information to our clients. Because we deliver these records with your 
account statements, other members of your household may have access to these 
records unless you instruct us to send them to you separately. 
If you do not want your statements and other periodic communications from us to be bundled 
by household, please contact your Financial Advisor and ask to receive individual mailings in 
separate envelopes or delivered separately via electronic means. 
Non-Primary Residence Address for Mailing Purposes 
Unless you notify us otherwise in writing, you authorize us to use the Account address you 
provided to mail all notices, correspondence and for the disbursement of Property, even if it is 
not your primary residence. Based upon this authorization, we will not telephone you to 
confirm receipt of property or require a signed written confirmation from you acknowledging 
transmittal of property. If you would like to designate an alternative mailing address for the 
Account, please contact your Financial Advisor to provide the necessary authorization. Even 
when you have provided a mailing address for the Account, some correspondence may be 
delivered to your legal residence address only based upon operational considerations. 
Applicable Law 
This Agreement, including the Arbitration provisions below, and its enforcement, is governed 
by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to such State's choice of law or 
conflict of laws provisions. The Agreement is binding on you and on UBS Financial Services Inc. 
and UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico provided that there is no inconsistency 
with the Federal securities laws or the Federal or State banking laws. In connection with any 
Card issued, the respective Cardholder Agreement shall be governed by Federal law and the 
law designated by the Card Issuer in that Cardholder Agreement. 
In the event that any of the Arbitration provisions below are found to be unenforceable, you 
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the Federal 
courts sitting in the Southern District of New York for the purpose of determining all matters 
with regard to the Agreement. You also consent to service of process by certified mail to your 
Account's address of record, and you waive any objection to the venue and any claims that an 
action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. If any provision of the 
Agreement is held to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in 
full force and will be construed to the fullest extent permitted by law, to give effect to the 
intent of any provision that has been called into question. 
Arbitration 
This Agreement contains a predispute arbitration clause. By signing an arbitration agreement 
the parties agree as follows: 
• 
All parties to this Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, 
including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the 
arbitration forum in which a claim is filed. 
• 
Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court 
reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited. 
• 
The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other 
discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings. 
• 
The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award, unless, in an 
eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all 
parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date. 
• 
The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or 
are affiliated with the securities industry. 
• 
The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in 
arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in 
court. 
This Arbitration Agreement represents 
standard industry practice and binds you 
and UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS 
Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto 
Rico to arbitraw any disagreements that 
may arise between the parties. 
"The patties' for purposes of this 
arbitration agreement, are UBS Financial 
Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services 
Incorporated of Puerto Rico and you, 
inducing on behalf of your heirs. 
executors, administrators and assigns.
