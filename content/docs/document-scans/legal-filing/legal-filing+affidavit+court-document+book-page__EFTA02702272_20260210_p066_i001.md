Registrar and Transfer Agent 
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. the property trustee will act as registrar 
and transfer agent for the preferred securities. 
Registration of transfers of preferred securities will be effected without charge by or on behalf of the trust. 
but upon payment of any tax or other governmental charges that may be imposed in connection with any transfer 
or exchange. The trust will not be required to register or cause to be registered the transfer of their preferred 
securities after such preferred securities have been called for redemption. (Section 5.4) 
Information Concerning the Property Trustee 
The property trustee, other than during the occurrence of and continuation of a default by us in performance 
of any trust-issued subordinated indenture, undertakes to perform, without negligence, acting in bad faith or 
willful misconduct, only those duties specifically set forth in the restated trust agreement, provided that it must 
exercise the same degree of care as a prudent person would exercise in the conduct of his or her own affairs after 
default with respect to any trust-issued subordinated indenture. Subject to this provision, the property trustee is 
under no obligation to exercise any of the powers vested in it by the applicable restated trust agreement at the 
request of any holder of preferred securities unless it is offered indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the property 
trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred thereby. If in performing its duties under 
the restated trust agreement, the property trustee is required to decide between alternative causes of action, 
construe ambiguous provisions in the applicable restated trust agreement or is unsure of the application of any 
provision of the applicable restated trust agreement, and the matter is not one on which holders of preferred 
securities are entitled under such restated trust agreement to vote, then the property trustee shall take such action 
as is directed by us. If it is not so directed, the property trustee shall take such action as it deems advisable and in 
the best interests of the holders of the tryst securities and will have no liability except for its own bad faith. 
negligence or willful misconduct. 
Administrative Trustees 
The administrative trustees are authorized and directed to conduct the affairs of and to operate the trust in 
such a way that it will not be deemed to be an "investment company" required to be registered under the 
Investment Company Act or classified as an association taxable as a corporation for United States Federal 
income tax purposes and so that the corresponding subordinated debt securities will be treated as our 
indebtedness for United States Federal income tax purposes. In this connection, we and the administrative 
trustees are authorized to take any action, not inconsistent with applicable law, the certificate of trust or the 
restated trust agreement, that we and the administrative trustees determine in our and their discretion to be 
necessary or desirable for such purposes, as long as such action does not materially adversely affect the interests 
of the holders of the related preferred securities.
