As =ou can see, the original claim by Buzzfeed, which they claimed was =erified 
'on the record' by Perimeter, was false. = believe this final claim is false, and I would like confirmation from =ou.. It may 
be a fine point, but I believe it is important. =riginally Michael informed me immediately after the event that there =as a 
complaint of inappropriate communication with one of the staff, =omething I indicated then and reiterate now, I am not 
aware of at all, =ut be that as it may, he informed me at the time by email that with no =urther communication with that 
person, the matter was closed. =everal years later I was invited to give another public lecture but =our outreach 
coordinator later rescinded the invitation, although I was =eimbursed for that. As you are aware, I subsequently 
discussed =his with Neil in Vancouver in that year, and inquired about exactly =hat it was all about, and informed him 
that either a formal procedure =o resolve any issue in which I could participate and respond might be =ppropriate, or 
the matter should be dropped. Neil said he would explore =he matter, and neither he, nor anyone else, ever contacted 
me following =hat. I have never been informed of anything like Buzzfeed has =laimed. Indeed I have been invited back 
to Perimeter for scientific =eetings by various colleagues in the intervening years. =nbsp; 
I =m very concerned by this claim below, for obvious reasons. First, =he original 
Perimeter source provided false and defamatory information =o Buzzfeed, changing a story only after I provided 
=ounter-evidence. Second, as you are aware Perimeter has never =ontacted me about any such proviso in the interim. 
The only =ocument I ever received was in 2009 from michael assuring me the matter =as closed, whatever it was. I 
would find it highly irregular if =ny formal procedure took place with such an outcome without my =nowledge or 
without any due process, and without subsequently informing =e. 
I =xpect the correct statement, if there is one, is that there was a =omplaint 
from someone at Perimeter about inappropriate communication at =he final party or while being driven back to the 
hotel after it (for =11 I know it may have been about religious issues), and that 3 years =ater a decision was made by the 
outreach coordinator, perhaps in =ollaboration with others, not to invite me back at that time for a =ublic lecture. 
Please confirm my understanding of this issue for me if you =ill. As you can 
imagine, making this public is embarrassing =nough for me, especially since I personally maintain whatever I may =ave 
said wasn't inappropriate, and there was certainly no =exual harassment by any definition of that word.. indeed there 
was =othing sexual in any discussion I know of. Nevertheless, if =omething is to be reported, indicating that it was a 
communication =ssue, and there was no formal ban on my returning to Perimeter =especially as nothing along these 
lines was ever communicated to me and = have received invites since that time) is less damning than suggesting 
=therwise. As Buzzfeed has tried, at every turn, to misrepresent =acts in the worst possible light, it is important for me 
to not allow =hem to continue to do this. For example, they contacted my =niversity and asked if there any claims fo 
sexual harassment against me =t the University, and though the University said there were not, but =hat there was an 
external allegation about a remote event that had been =iscredited (the one I mentioned above), Buzzfeed announced 
they would =eport that they contacted the University with a request for information =bout sexual harassment 
allegations and were not given any information =n return.. 
Last, it could be of course that Buzzfeed has reiinterpeted =tatements from 
Perimeter staff, but if a member of your staff made the =riginal false allegation to Buzzfeed (violating confidentiality in 
the =rocess I expect) I would like you to at least be aware of this and act =ccordingly. 
Thanks very much for your prompt and immediate attention to =his request.
