2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82496, * 
10 See Pull v. America's Servicing Co.. No. 07-0389. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33447. 2008 WL 1833182. at '4 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 23. 
2008) (-Defendant America's Servicing was not a party to the mortgage. Therefore. it cannot be held liable for breach of 
contract"). [13] Cannon v. Wells Fargo Bank. N.A., 917 F. Si4pp. 2d 1025. 2013 WI. 132450'22 (N.D. Cal. 2013) CIA] breach-
of.contract claim carrrot be maintained against Wells Fargo [the loan service') as it was not a contracting party"); McKenzie v. 
Wells Fargo Home Mort, Inc.. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155480. 2012 WL 5372120'20 n.12 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 30. 2012) ("The 
mortgage contract is between Lender and Borrower. It Wells was acting as servicer, and not as Lender or Lender's agent. when 
it required increased insurance coverage, it could not be sued for breach of contract since it is not a party to the contract.")). 
Here, Statebridge argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for breath of contract, 
because "a 'service only receives limited rights and obligations under the mortgage 
contract relating to servicing" and Statebridge therefore "does not have the required privity 
between the parties[.]" (SMTD at 29) However, this question of fact should not be resolved 
at this stage. For now, the Court notes only that Statebridge is the party listed on Plaintiffs 
"Evidence of Insurance" form under "Insured / Lender" (Dkt. No. 9-1 at 16) and finds that 
Statebridge plausibly stands in the shoes of EquiFirst with regard to Plaintiff's mortgage 
agreement with EquiFirst. 
Statebridge's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs breach of contract claim on the basis that 
Statebridge is not a party to the contract will therefore ['24] be denied. 
b. The contract does not authorize Defendants' actions. 
Statebridge also argues that the mortgage agreement authorizes Defendants' actions, 
because it alerts borrower that they must maintain insurance "in the amounts . . . and for 
the periods that Lender requires," and that if such coverage lapses, the Lender "is under 
no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of [force-placed] coverage" which 
"shall cover Lender, but might or might not protect Borrower, Borrowers equity in the 
Property, or the contents of the Property against any risk, hazard or liability and might 
provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect." (SMTD at 30-31) The 
agreement further provides that the cost of force-placed insurance "might significantly 
exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained." (Id. at 31) Based on this 
language, Statebridge concludes that the breaches that Plaintiff alleges "are in fact 
contemplated by and expressly authorized by the Mortgage." (Id.) 
This conclusion is not persuasive. Section 9 of the Mortgage Agreement authorizes a 
Lender to "do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's 
interest in the Property ['25] and rights under this Security Instrument." (Mortgage 
Agreement at 4-5) But Plaintiff has alleged a kickback scheme that imposes costs on the 
borrower beyond the costs of providing force-placed insurance. In executing the Mortgage 
Agreement, Plaintiff may have agreed, in the event of a lapse in voluntary coverage, to 
allow the force-placement of insurance that is more expensive and less protective of 
Plaintiff's interests than the coverage that lapsed: however, the agreement in no way 
evidences Plaintiffs consent to or awareness of the alleged kickback scheme driving some 
portion of those additional costs. In fact, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants used the 
Mortgage Agreement to suggest that excessive premiums were legitimately necessary to 
cover the costs of providing force-placed insurance, masking the illegitimate profits 
Statebridge collected instead. The agreement authorizes no such action, as it is neither 
reasonable nor appropriate to protect the Lenders interest, and the Court will therefore 
deny Statebridge's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs breach of contract claim on that basis.
