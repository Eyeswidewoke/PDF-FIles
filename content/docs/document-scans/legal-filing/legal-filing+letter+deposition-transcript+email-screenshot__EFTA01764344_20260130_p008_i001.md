to power, and if his coalition expands =t will be for the purpose of stability and maybe war with Iran -- not for =old 
moves toward the Palestinians. 
Let's face it: You =on't have much credibility with Netanyahu. If you want any progress, you'r= going to have to figure 
out a way to create a relationship with him. In a=y event, think small for now. Do what you can to keep the Egyptian-
Israeli peace treaty afloat. Push internation=l donors to keep the Palestinian Authority in the black. Press hard on 
kee=ing Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation up and running. Push the Isra=lis to end restrictions on movement and 
economy opportunities for Palestinians. And, if there's a way to encou=age quiet discussion on the least contentious 
final-status issues like ter=itory and security, try that too. 
If you truly can't =elp yourself and need to lay out a U.S. plan on all of the big issues, go =head. Chances are they'll still 
be out there when your successor takes the=inaugural oath. But don't delude yourself with visions of being the man to 
solve this thing once and for all. 
On Syria, don't be =ulled into believing that some notional post-election flexibility is going=to expand your options there. 
As long as the rebels are so inchoate, the r=gime so militarily powerful, and the Russians so supportive of President 
Bashar al-Assad, the chances for drama=ic change are pretty low. 
That doesn't mean y=u should be idle on the Syrian front. Do what you can to ease the humanita=ian and refugee crisis. 
Support Jordan, continue to work with the Turks, a=d support efforts to encourage a credible Syrian opposition. But be 
wary of a more proactive policy on the military =ide, particularly when it comes to providing sophisticated weaponry to a 
d=vided rebel movement whose interests may not necessarily be yours and whic= is acquiring its own record of war 
crimes. 
6. Fix America's=house even as you persist in trying to fix others. 
Here's the bad news= Your credibility will begin to diminish the first day after your inaugura=ion, and your status as a 
lame duck will grow ever closer as 2016 nears. 
It's not that you c=n't chew gum and walk at the same time. The United States has to be involv=d in the rest of the world 
even while its domestic house is in a state of =isarray. The major priority, though, must be on fixing our broken house 
and addressing the Five Deadly D's that=sap American strength: debt, deficit, dysfunctional politics, decaying 
inf=astructure, and dependence on hydrocarbons. If you bet on risky adventures=abroad and lose, your credibility and 
political stock will fall when, in fact, it's badly needed to deal wit= pressing domestic matters, particularly the economy. 
Governing is about =hoosing. The best thing you can do both for America and its position in th= world is to address the 
sources of domestic weakness. If you succeed on t=at front, you will be strengthening the foundation on which our 
foreign policy rests. And in the process, who =nows? You might actually become what you aspire to be -- a truly 
consequen=ial American president.
