Deborah — 
I'm following up on our conversation on Tuesday about =rincipal distributions to Noam from the Carol S. 
Chomsky marital =rusts. Please consider the following: 
1. 
As I stated to you and as I now affirm to you in writing, = am certain that in the exercise of my 
discretionary power to make =istributions of principal from the trusts I'm entitled to inquire into Noam's =inancial 
circumstances, including (a) the nature and extent of his =esources, (b) his sources of income, and (c) his expenditures. 
In =act, I'm equally certain that my fiduciary duty to Noam requires me to obtain that information so as to =dequately 
address his long-term needs and to ensure that the trust is =sed for his exclusive benefit during his lifetime. (I am 
mindful =f the interests of Noam's children, as residuary beneficiaries of the trusts, and of my fiduciary duty to them as 
well, but as l'=e stated to you previously, my primary concern has been and continues =o be Noam's interests.) 
2. 
Having previously been assured (prior to making tax =ayments on Noam's behalf at the end of 
2015 and in early 2016) =hat Noam would engage in a financial planning process with Nick Nichols, and having notified 
you at the time =hat I did not intend to make any further principal distributions until =hat process was completed, I 
informed you on Tuesday that I was not =repared to make any principal distributions to Noam now. On further 
reflection, and mindful of Noam's =istress, I've reconsidered the circumstances and am willing to =ake the proposed 
$150,000 payment to the IRS on his behalf, provided =hat you will (a) urge Noam to engage in a financial planning 
process (with Nick Nichols or another financial professional of his choosing), =b) urge Noam to cooperate in providing 
some information to me =bout his financial resources, income and expenses (to a degree mutually =cceptable), and (c) 
impress upon Noam the fact that though lam now making another tax payment from the trust on his =ehalf, I do so with 
no intention of making further distributions of =rincipal unless he completes the financial planning and disclosure 
=rocess that was agreed upon in 2015. 
3. 
Lastly, with respect to my trusteeship, I have suggested =o Harry Chomsky that I prepare a short 
list of qualified, professional =rustees for his consideration and for Noam's. It is my hope that one of those =andidates 
would be acceptable to Harry and to Noam (with your =ecommendation). This seems to me a good approach, given that 
Harry has =nequivocally declared his unwillingness to appoint Rich Kahn as my successor. Needless to say, if you'd like 
to =uggest another approach to finding a successor to me I will be glad to =iscuss it with Harry. 
If you are in agreement with the points set out above, please =eply acknowledging each of them and 
please also affirm that (as was the =ase with respect to the 2015 and 2016 tax payments) you have no =bjection to my 
direct payment of funds to the IRS, as an expedient and =ermissible means to expedite that payment (instead of having 
me arrange =or the distribution of the funds to Noam's personal account for =ubsequent payment to the IRS). Lastly, 
please ask Noam's accountant to prepare a suitable estimated tax payment voucher and =orward it directly to me as 
soon as possible. I will then ask =oam's investment advisors at Bainco to raise the necessary =unds and make the 
payment.
