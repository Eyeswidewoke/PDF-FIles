Years 4-5 will be used to test our refined model in new populations. One important group 
is children and adolescents, because we want to understand when and how principles and 
parameters are modified in development. This issue could have important implications not only 
for theory but also for educational practice — if parameters are set early in life, and if the 
developing brain effectively loses its plasticity, opportunities for moral change may be severely 
constrained. In addition, to determine whether our "moral grammar is universal, we will test 
cultures around the world, including a set of small-scale societies, such as hunter-gather 
populations. We already have some contacts at potential sites, but significant travel will be 
required by a new set of trained graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, in addition to 
training Students in some of these countries. Finally, it will be illuminating to test our model on 
patient populations, including individuals with brain damage or mental illness (especially people 
with psychopathy, scrupulosity OCD, and autism). 
This project involves a wide range of methods and theoretical perspectives as well as 
subject populations. This diversity reflects the complexity of the issues surrounding morality. 
Hence, to make this project work, we will need constant input from a variety of leaders in all of 
the relevant fields. We will also need adequate funding for a variety of methods including brain 
scanning and extensive travel to new populations of subjects. This is a large project with 
potentially large payoff not only in theory but also in practice in areas (such as law and 
education) that depend on moral judgment. 
Although many details remain to be worked out, a tentative rough budget might look 
something like this: 
Summer salary for PI and Co-PI: 
2 people X 5 years X one quarter salary = about $500,000 
Honoraria for other lead researchers: 
5 years X 12 researchers X $10,000 honorarium = $600,000 
Post-docs in Years 2-3 and 4-5 (2 at Harvard and 2 at Duke): 
4 years X 4 post-docs X $80,000 (including benefits) = $1,280,000 
Meetings of all personnel: 
5 years X 4 meetings per year X 15 researchers X $1000/person = $300,000 
Conferences in years 1 and 5: 
2 conferences x $50,000 = $100,000 
Programming for web surveys: 
5 years X $20,000 per year = $100,000 
Brain imaging, VR lab costs: 
3 years (3-5) X $300,000 per year = $900,000 
Patient studies: 
2 years (4-5) X $100,000 per year = $200,000 
Travel for cross-cultural studies: 
2 years (4-5) X $100,000 per year = $200,000 
Administration: 
5 years X $60,000 per year (including benefits) = $300,000 
Miscellaneous (for overruns and opportunities): 
5 years X $100,000 per year = $500,000 
Total: $4,980,000 
Of course, these figures are only rough estimates at this point. There are also some possibilities 
for reductions in some areas. We could, for example, provide only 2 months summer salary to 
the PI and Co-PI and honoraria of only $5000 to other lead researchers, reduce the number of 
lead researchers from 12 to 8 and the number of post-docs from 4 to 2, cut the brain scanning as 
well as patient studies and travel by half, and include less for opportunities in the miscellaneous 
fund. These savings would reduce the overall budget to about $3,000,000 for five years. 
We are, of course, more than happy to discuss any of these plans and expenses in more 
detail. Indeed, we look forward to many discussions about this project and about the feasibility of 
funding a large scale investigation into the nature of our moral sense.
