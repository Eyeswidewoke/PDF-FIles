Sony for the delay — I just finished my finals at MIT this week. Long email below, answering your question and 
an update on my activities. 
I would like to go, yes. I am currently scheduling that week out as there is Joi's forbidden research, defcon, and 
a bitcoin conference I am submitting a paper to all that week. I talked with Vincenzo about going and he thought 
it was a good idea. Question: are these sorts of things I should send to you for reimbursement? 
For a bit of an update on what I've been up to: 
Thesis: 
I've finished my M.Eng Thesis at MIT. I don't fully agree with the ideas I presented, but it was more of a 
formalization of a set of ideas. The core idea of my thesis is that decentralized utilization incentives are a good 
midpoint between Keynes and Hayek, and then I show a construction of them. The big application level take-
aways from my thesis relate to spectrum allocation and solar energy. There's a lot of stuff you can skip, maybe 
just read chapters 1 & 3 (they're short) if you're interested.

Current Projects: 
Earlier this spring, I gave a talk (https://medium.com/eieremyrubiniimnrovina-the-bitcoin-development-process-
e37c3a8606e5#jrily6ulp) on starting a competition process to improve Bitcoin development. I have kinds for it 
that I have accessible from MIT Bitcoin Project (I made a $40 k allocation) but I'm unsure of how I should 
structure it -- if I should start a new nonprofit or just run reimbursement and fees through MIT. I think it probably 
makes sense to run it through MIT. I plan to have this ready around September. 
I'm also working on a paper right now for http://www.zurich.ibm.conVdccl/ which is a systematization of 
knowledge on off-blockchain technology in Bitcoin. Off chain systems offer one or more of the following 
(excepted from forthcoming paper): 
1Separated Guarantees, the mechanism has guarantees are ensured mostly by a system or 
mechanism separated from the hlockchain. 
2. Hidden State. the mechanism has state that does not need to he present the Nockchain. 
3. Efficiency Optimized, the mechanism reduces the utilization of the Nockchain compared to 
naive implementation 
the problem the mech- anism attempts to solve. 
For the next month or so I'm trying to decompress a bit from MIT and clear my mind a bit and wrap up various 
projects so that I'm ready to delve into new ideas. A couple things I've been toying with lately: 
- Hard tech play, I have a new design for probabilistic payment schemes that could be interesting to implement. 
Will at least be a good paper. 
- Starting a new stock exchange — what can a ground up redesign of a stock exchange do/offer clients? Is it 
possible to tap the SF/Bay area distaste for NASDAQ. Could potentially rope in some friends with a lot of 
exchange dev experience to this. 
- On either of the above, hiring first and asking questions later -- building a team and experience is important at 
this phase of the game, so maybe start working on one of these prepared to pivot 
- Cuba infrastructure — huge first-to-market advantage if I can build something in this untouched market and 
potential to have a lot of positive impact. Lot's of tourist money coming in.
