SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
the Master Fund purchase and sell stocks and securities. The Onshore Feeder Fund, the 
Offshore Feeder Fund or their respective Investors may be required to file tax returns in 
particular countries or to provide information regarding beneficial ownership or 
certification that they are eligible for a reduced rate of taxation (e.g., treaty benefits) in 
particular countries. 
If appropriate, the Onshore Feeder Fund or the Offshore Feeder Fund may organize 
intermediate vehicles through which it will invest in the Master Fund (or stocks and 
securities), or may take other steps, in order to, for example, mitigate any requirement that 
Investors file tax returns in, or provide information to, countries in which the Master Fund 
makes investments. However, no assurances can be made that these mitigation steps will 
be effective. Moreover, countries other than the United States may impose transfer, stamp, 
documentary or other similar taxes in respect of an investment in the Onshore Fund or the 
Offshore Feeder Fund by certain Investors. For Investors in the Onshore Feeder Fund, 
such taxes will be treated as an expense of Investors to the extent such taxes are borne by 
the Onshore Feeder Fund. Investors may not be able to claim any tax credits with respect 
to these taxes. 
Investors in the Onshore Feeder Fund and the Offshore Feeder Fund may be required to 
include the gross amount (before imposition of taxes) of dividends, interest and gains in 
their income in their home jurisdiction and, depending on the tax rules of their home 
jurisdiction, may be entitled to claim either a credit (in the case of U.S. Holders, subject, 
however, to various limitations on foreign tax credits, as discussed above under "Foreign 
Tax Credit Limitations") or a deduction (in the case of U.S. Holders, subject to the 
limitations generally applicable to deductions) for their share of such foreign taxes in 
computing their tax liability in their home jurisdiction. Because the Cayman Islands is not 
a party to treaties that provide for the reduction of withholding taxes, any such taxes on the 
Offshore Feeder Fund may be imposed at a higher rate than would be the case if an investor 
had acquired such securities directly. 
Because the Offshore Feeder Fund will elect to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes, U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors will not be entitled to claim a credit for 
any non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Offshore Feeder Fund or the Master Fund and, in 
general, will not be eligible to claim the benefits of any income tax treaty between the 
United States and a foreign country to reduce such taxes. 
Cayman Islands Tax Considerations 
Under current Cayman Islands law, there are no taxes on income or gains and distributions 
made by the Offshore Feeder Fund will not be subject to withholding tax in the Cayman 
Islands. The Cayman Islands currently imposes stamp duty on certain categories of 
documents; however the contemplated operations of the Offshore Feeder Fund do not 
involve the payment of stamp duties in any material amount.
