=C2 In December 2012, NBAA and NATA representatives met with Chief Couns=l's Office attorneys and 
submitted a draft Chief Counsel's Advice =o correct the CCA. 
• 
=C2 In February 2013, NBAA and NATA provided a memorandum to the Chief C=unsel's Office attorneys 
explaining that Rev. Rul. 74.123 does not pro=ide clear guidance that owner flights on managed aircraft are taxable 
transportation. 
• 
=C2 In March 2013, NBAA and NATA representatives again met with the Chie= Counsel's Office 
attorneys who agreed in general terms that existing =ublished guidance does not provide clear guidance on the issue. At 
the meeting, the Chief Counsel's Office attorneys stated=that they would support a request for guidance on the issue 
(such as a reg=lations project) and recommended that we meet with SBSE regarding audits o= management companies. 
• 
=C2 On May 8, 2013, with the support of Chief Counsel's Office attor=eys, representatives of NBAA and 
NATA met with SBSE representatives and re=uested that FET audits of owner flights on managed aircraft be terminated 
or at least suspended. 
Accordin=ly, the suspension of assessments is the result of a multi-year effort to =ddress this issue. However, it 
represents only an interim step in the process of working toward a resolution of the issue= 
Expec=ed Future Guidance 
In April=2013, NBAA submitted a request to the IRS to include this issue on the IRS=priority guidance plan. 
Because the request is supported by the Chief Counsel's Office attorneys and by SBSE, it seem= highly likely that it will 
be included in the priority guidance plan. We =re advised that the IRS will decide shortly whether to add the project to 
=he guidance plan and what form the guidance will take. From our meetings, it seems likely that the IRS will o=en a 
regulations project, rather than a less precedential form of guidance=such as a revenue ruling or another chief counsel 
advice. 
NBAA pla=s to continue to meet with IRS and Treasury representatives as guidance is=developed on this issue. 
On May 9, 2013, NBAA representatives met with Treasury Tax Legislative Counsel and provided dra=t regulations along 
with other background materials on the issue. 
In recen= years, but particularly after the issuance of Chief Counsel Advice 201210=26 (March 9, 2012) (the 
"CCA"), the IRS has been aggressively auditing aircraft management companies and asserting that FET=applies to flights 
by aircraft owners on managed aircraft. The IRS argues =hat the management company has taken possession, command, 
and control of t=e aircraft and is providing air transportation service to the aircraft owner. However, the IRS has not 
iss=ed clear guidance that can be cited as legal precedent to support this the=ry. (CCAs cannot be cited as legal 
precedent.)<=span> 
Impli=ations of the Suspension on Assessments 
The susp=nsion on assessments of FET was announced by the Small Business/Self Emplo=ment (SBSE) division of 
the IRS, which includes the FET auditors. The intent is to suspend the collection of these taxes u=til after the issuance of 
clear authoritative guidance, such as regulation=. At the SBSE meeting, we requested that the IRS terminate the FET 
audits =f owner flights, but SBSE decided to merely suspend the assessments instead. 
We under=tand that this decision was communicated informally to FET audit managers,=likely by conference 
call. If the guidance project takes a long time, then the lack of a written document announcing the susp=nsion on 
assessments may result in misunderstandings with IRS auditors reg=rding the scope of the suspension.
