785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
despite a policy of investigating complaints of racial harassment, "[n]ot even one of the five 
department managers has been shown to have lifted a finger to redress the racially hostile 
work environment found to exist both plant-wide and in each department." Appellants' Br. 
25. The workers have sufficiently alleged that such a uniform policy of managerial inaction 
also contributed to racial disparities in promotions decisions. 
Consistent with Scott, the workers have further demonstrated that the exercise of 
discretion at Nucor was joined by "a company-wide policy of discrimination" that was 
encouraged, or at least tolerated, by supervisors and managers. See Scott, 733 F.3d at 
114. In addition to the evidence of a hostile work environment previously described in 
detail, one white supervisor has expressly stated in a deposition that he heard the head of 
the Beam Mill declare, "I don't think we'll ever have a black supervisor while I'm here." J.A. 
1885-86. Such facts provide a critical nexus between the racial animus at the plant and 
promotions decisions that impacted all black workers by foreclosing opportunities for them. 
Or, using Wal-Mart's language, the evidence of pervasive racial hostility in the working 
[**56] environment provides a "common mode of exercising discretion that pervade[dj the 
entire company." Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2554-55. 
In the end, Wal-Mart simply "found it unlikely" that thousands of managers across different 
regions "would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common 
direction." Tabor, 703 F.3d at 1222. Here, however, the workers have provided ample 
evidence supporting their allegation of a common, racially-biased exercise of discretion 
throughout the plant - demonstrated through alleged incidents of specific discrimination in 
promotions decisions, statistical disparities, and facts suggesting pervasive plant-wide 
racism. The district court abused its discretion in finding that such evidence was 
insufficient to meet the burden that Wal-Mart imposes. 
IV. 
Nucor further argues that the workers have failed to contest the district court's independent 
finding that the putative class failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3). As the company observes, the 
district court specifically held that the class failed to meet the rule's requirements for a 
class action seeking individualized money damages, namely, that common questions 
predominate over individualized inquiries and that the class action is "superior to other 
available methods for fairly and ["57] efficiently adjudicating the controversy." Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 23(b)(3). The court remarked that "even if the Fourth Circuit subsequently 
concludes that the plaintiffs have identified a common issue that satisfies Rule 23(a)(2), 
this Court nonetheless finds that 'common issues,' as that term is defined by Wal-Mart, do 
not predominate over individual [' 918] issues with regard to the plaintiffs' promotions 
claims."r J.A. 10956. 
22 This Court has previously observed that g-IN27] lijn a class action brought under Rule 23(5)(3), the 'commonality' 
requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) is 'subsumed wrier. or superseded by. the more stringent Rule 23(b)(3) requirement that 
questions common to the class predominate over' other questions." Lienhart v. Dryvit Sys.. Inc.. 255 F.3d 138, 146 n.4 (4th Cir. 
2001) (quoting Amchem. 521 U.S. at 609). But as Wal-Mart made clear, the Rule 23(a) commonality requirement and the Rule 
23(b)(3) predominance requirement remain separate inquiries. Wal-Man. 131 S. Ct. at 2556.
