2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40263, * 
it is not enough for the non-moving party to show there is some metaphysical doubt as to 
material facts. Id. 
In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court may not take into account credibility, 
the weight of the evidence, or the drawing of inferences from the facts. Anderson, 477 U.S. 
at 255. "The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are 
to be drawn in his favor." Id. "[I]l the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a 
verdict for the nonmoving party," summary judgment is improper. Id. at 248. Accordingly, 
for the purposes of deciding this motion, and where communicated properly under Rule 56, 
plaintiffs' account of p23] the facts must be accepted as true. 
B. Consent to Summary Judgment 
In the first amended complaint, plaintiffs assert nine claims against defendant. In response 
to defendant's motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs consent to summary judgment on 
six of the nine claims, as follows: Count 1(B) alleging an oral contract created by Rozak's 
representations, Count 2 alleging breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, Count 3 
alleging willful misconduct and intentional misrepresentation, Count 4 alleging intentional 
infliction of emotional distress, and Count 5 alleging negligent misrepresentation. By failing 
to dispute (and actually consenting to) Banco's motion for summary judgment as to these 
claims and the materials offered in support thereof, plaintiffs have not carried their burden 
under Rule 56(c) and, therefore, defendant is entitled to summary judgment on these 
claims. Travelers Cas. & Sur. Co. of Am. v. J.O.A. Const. Co., Inc., 479 Fed. Appx. 684, 
692 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2)-(3)). Accordingly, defendant's motion for 
summary judgment as to these claims is GRANTED.'•All that remains therefore for the 
Court's analysis are defendant's arguments respecting ['24] plaintiffs' remaining claims for 
breach of contract (Counts 1(A) and 1(C)) and for promissory estoppel, alleged in 
paragraph 58 of plaintiffs' first amended complaint. 
16 At page 1427 of their opposition brief, plaintiffs also purport to consent to summary judgment as to their "alternative" 
promissory estoppel claim; however, at page 1453. plaintiffs argue against summary judgment on this claim. Accordingly, given 
plaintiffs equivocation, the Court will address this clan) infra. 
C. Plaintiffs Have Not Carried Their Burden as to Damages 
Defendant moves for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' breach of contract claims (Counts 
1(A) and 1(C)) on the grounds that, without expert testimony (which plaintiffs have failed to 
offer) (Doc. No. 35 at 260), plaintiffs cannot establish with reasonable certainty their 
claimed "equity/profit" damages resulting from their inability to purchase Allred Metal. 
Plaintiffs respond that since Banco was ready to lend Loadman "$6 million based on its 
own due diligence reports, [which] were in turn based on independent appraisals of Allred 
Metal Stamping's assets[,]" Banco cannot now claim those estimates are speculative or 
that a jury could not reasonably find r251 that Loadman's "lost equity" on the day of 
closing fell between $4 million and $10 million. (Doc. No. 45 at 1454.) Further, plaintiffs 
assert they will prove damages by calling Kozak at trial. (Id.)
