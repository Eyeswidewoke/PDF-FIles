Paul and Rich, 
Here is the material Michael is referring to that will help guide the discussion. 
PPVA Overview: This document is a simple one-page summary of a PPVA Investment Account. Under IRC Section 72, an 
investment account administered by an insurance company qualifies for deferral of investment gains from current 
period taxation. A client can open a PPVA Investment Account and invest in traditional and/or alternative asset class 
investment funds. The PPVA Investment Account has no restriction on contributions or withdrawals (other than those 
imposed by an investment manager) and no surrender charges. Withdrawals are taxed on a LIFO basis (the gain element 
is recognized first and taxed at ordinary income rates, and then the cost basis is returned tax-free). There is a 10% 
excise tax applicable to the gain element of any withdrawals from the PPVA Investment Account taken prior to the 
owner's age 59.5. If a client bequeaths the PPVA Investment Account to a private foundation or public charity, the 
deferred taxes are eliminated altogether, and the charity will receive the full value of the account. PPVA Investment 
Accounts should be considered when the client's objectives are: 1) deferral of income taxes on investment allocations 
to asset classes that would otherwise be highly tax-inefficient, and/or 2) optimization of the value that will ultimately be 
bequeathed to a private foundation or public charity. 
Optimizing Planned Gifts to a Private Foundation or Public Charity: This one-page presentation highlights the 
attributes and economics of utilizing a PPVA Investment Account for assets earmarked for charitable bequests. The 
private foundation or public charities will receive more than double the asset value in 20 years and nearly triple the 
asset value in 30 years simply by locating the investment portfolio within a tax-deferred environment versus continuing 
to expose the investment portfolio to current period income taxes. The PPVA Investment Account is unique in that it 
allows the owner to: 
-- maintain control of the investment portfolio throughout his/her lifetime 
-- defer investment portfolio gains from current period taxation 
-- allocate investment portfolio values to any of the registered and non-registered investment funds made available by 
the insurance company 
-- avoid required distributions until the owner's age 95 or 100 (at which time the distributions can be taken over a 30 
year period of time) 
-- eliminate the taxes on investment gains altogether if a private foundation or public charity is named as the 
beneficiary. This beneficiary designation is completely revocable and can be adjusted at any time.
