Finally, the Senior-Lien Notes holders argue that the lower courts erred in disregarding 
their contractual right to rescind acceleration,,4 a right that if invoked would have reinstated 
the original maturity date and thereby kept the Optional Redemption Clauses (and 
therefore the make-whole premium) in effect. 
16 "Holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may rescind any such acceleration 
with respect to the Notes and its consequences." 15-1682 a 2260. 
AMR forecloses this argument as well. There, considering nearly identical indenture 
language, we concluded that a creditor's post-petition invocation of a contractual right to 
rescind an acceleration triggered automatically by a bankruptcy filing is barred because it 
would be "an attempt to modify contract rights and would therefore be subject to the 
automatic ['8O4] stay." 730 F.3d at 102; see also id. at 102-03 ("any attempt by U.S. 
Bank to rescind acceleration now--after the automatic stay has taken effect—is an effort to 
affect American's contract rights, and thus the property of the estate"). 
The Senior-Lien Notes holders again attempt to distinguish AMR by relying on the fact that 
the acceleration provision there, unlike the one here, expressly disavowed the make-whole 
premium. ("341 According to the 1.5-Lien Notes holders, our concern in AMR was 
therefore with not allowing the creditors "an end-run around their bargain by rescission." 
15-1682 Br. of 1.5-Lien Appellant 45. This argument fails because, although the provisions 
at issue here do not expressly disallow the make-whole premium, the Optional 
Redemption Clauses, as we have seen, achieve this result. Therefore, just as in AMR, 
because the right to rescind acceleration here would serve as "an end-run around their 
bargain by rescission," the lower courts correctly concluded that the automatic stay barred 
rescission of the acceleration of the Notes.

Debtors seek dismissal of these appeals under [HN12] the principle of equitable 
mootness, a "prudential doctrine that is invoked to avoid disturbing a reorganization plan 
once implemented." In re Metromedia Fiber Network Inc., 416 F.3d 136, 144 (2d Cir. 
2005)." The doctrine "allows appellate courts to dismiss bankruptcy appeals 'when, during 
the pendency of an appeal, events occur' such that 'even though effective relief could 
conceivably be fashioned, implementation of that relief would be inequitable." In re Motors 
Liquidation Co., 829 F.3d 135, 167 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting In re Chateaugay Corp., 988 
F.2d 322, 325 (2d Cir. 1993) ("Chateaugay If)). The doctrine requires us to "carefully 
balance the importance of finality in bankruptcy proceedings against the appellant's right 
("35] to review and relief." R<2> Invs., LDC v. Charter Communs., Inc. (In re Charter 
Communs., Inc.), 691 F.3d 476, 481 (2d Cir. 2012). With these principles in mind, we 
decline to dismiss any of these appeals as equitably moot.
