impress upon the newly united Syrian opposition that support dep=nds on strict adherence to international 
humanitarian law. Armed groups wh= advocate fracturing Syria along sectarian or regional lines should be den=ed funds; 
there should be absolutely no aid for rebel groups who target Al=wites and other minorities for reprisals or who commit 
war crimes. 
Second, outside governments should intensify their efforts to hold all perp=trators of mass atrocities accountable at the 
International Criminal Court= regardless of their allegiance. That also means allocating funds for addi=ional United 
Nations human rights monitors on the Syrian border in order t= collect evidence and testimony for future prosecutions. 
Syria has experienced untold horrors throughout its history. But it is a hi=toric crossroads of cultures, faiths and 
civilizations. The real choice in=Syria today is not between Alawites or Sunnis, or between Mr. Assad and AI=Qaeda, but 
between action enabling further crimes against humanity to take=place and action dedicated to ending impunity for 
such crimes once and for=all.

The Gaza Invasion: Will It Destroy Israel's Relationship With Egypt? 
Eric Trager 
The fact that Israel endured over 800 rocket attacks from 
Gaza<https://twit=er.comiwashinstitute/status/268784101895589889> in the past year before co=mencing yesterday's 
military operation against Hamas suggests that Jerusal=m hoped to avoid the current flare-up. Among other concerns, 
the Israeli g=vernment knew that another Gaza war would ignite the neighboring Egyptian =street," and since Egypt's 
post-revolutionary government would have to be =ore responsive to popular sentiments, a downgrade in Israeli-
Egyptian rela=ions would be likely. The rise of the Muslim Brotherhood -- Hamas' Egyptia= cousin -- as Egypt's new ruling 
party exacerbated those 
qualms<http://onl=ne.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303640804577488930454305916.html>, give= the 
Brotherhood's longtime opposition to the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace =reaty and refusal to acknowledge Israel's rightful 
existence. 
It was therefore unsurprising that Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, a form=r Brotherhood leader, conceded to 
popular outrage<http://english.ahram.org=eg/NewsContent/1/64/58146/Egypt/Politics-/Hundreds-march-in-Cairo-to-
deman=-an-end-to-diplom.aspx> in the wake of "Operation Pillar of Cloud" this we=k by recalling Egypt's ambassador to 
Israel. Yet in the grand scheme of di=lomatic gestures, this was, in fact, a relatively minor move. Indeed, form=r 
President Hosni Mubarak did exactly same thing<http://www.guardian.co.uk=world/2000/nov/22/israel> in November 
2000 when Egyptian demonstrations ag=inst Israel mounted during the second intifada. The real question, therefo=e, is 
what Morsi does next: will he stop at simply recalling his ambassado=, or will use the fighting in Gaza to justify a more 
severe approach towar=s Israel? 
At the moment, Morsi is seemingly being pulled in two directions. On one ha=d, Egypt's diplomatic and security 
establishments are urging calm. In this=vein, Foreign Minister Mohamed Amr issued a bland 
statement<http://english=ahram.org.eg/News/S8130.aspx> calling on Israel to stop the fighting, and =as taken the 
matter to the Arab League, which, in addition to being feckle=s, won't discuss the fighting in Gaza until 
Saturday<http://www.chicagotri=une.com/news/sns-rt-us-arableague-gazabre8adll0-20121114,0,7228486.story>. 
Meanwhile, during the three days leading up to Wednesday's conflagration, E=ypt's intelligence services had been 
working to prevent Israel-Hamas escal=tion, and they are now hoping that the current episode will pass speedily =efore 
Egyptian-Israeli relations are truly endangered. "Whatever happened =appened," a high-ranking intelligence official told 
me yesterday when I as=ed whether a prolonged Gaza conflict would lead Morsi to intensify his res=onse. "We must 
look to the future without any blood or escalation." 
Yet the Muslim Brotherhood is pulling Morsi in a very different direction. =n the wake of Wednesday's fighting, the 
Brotherhood called<http://www.ikhw=nonline.cominew/Article.aspx?ArtID=128660&SecID=212> on Morsi to "seve= 
diplomatic and trade relations with this usurper entity," so that the Egy=tian government can "begin to be a role model 
for Arabs and Muslims who ke=p relations with this entity." The Brotherhood will also organize mass pro=ests against 
Israel<http://dailynewsegypt.com/2012/11/14/brotherhood-calls=for-protests-against-israeli-actionh on Friday, and
