Nothing left to say. ficeAny absolute statement relating to properties of the world around us must be considered as an 
unjustified extrapolation. Only a description based on observations and relative to the process of observation can be valid.a75
We no longer talk of states; we measure. The measuring operation: irreversible and indeterminate. 
Living with nothing: fro:costing not less than everything:0 accDo I dare / Disturb the universe:4i' Living with the knowledge 
that intention makes no difference. aceIn the oblivion of cards / One exists among pure principles. / Neither the cards nor the 
trees nor the air / Persist as facts. This is an escape / To principium, to meditation. / One knows at last what to think about / 
And thinks about it without consciousness, / Under the oak trees, completely released.am
There is no difference in doing less. You canaTMt pay less than one hundred percent attention. Thema-rids no quantity in a no 
thing, non-accretive dimension. Numbers donatMt count, from one to two. Quantity: ha ha. The doing of aceyou &A the 
doing of aceyou cloning:a one hundred percent attention. The name, the sign of distinction, the description are assumed as a 
consequence of the coupling: undifferentiated activity; coupling: a verb. You caning pay less than one hundred percent 
attention: call this a part, call that a whole; call this man, call that God; call this finite, call that infinite; call this the totality, 
call that the selection obscuring the totality: the description is the thing. The assumption of the description: a consequence of 
coupling: the observational operation: complete, determinate, one hundred percent. You canaTMt pay less than one hundred 
percent attention. aceThe part / Is the equal of the whole/0 Everything is interchangeable on a live level. 
Awareness no longer matters. Knowledge makes no difference: there is no outside world to change. There canaTMt be 
communication if there are no differences: here and there, before and after, now and then. From and to are no longer useful 
words. Between is merely ridiculous. 
There canaTMt be communication if there is no differentiation: point A and point B. No differentiation: no communication. No 
differentiation: no signal accretively advancing by increments of space and time from message source A to message 
destination B. The current word is nonaccrctivc, undifferentiated, mathematical: the statistical expression of coupling: only 
the final sum matters: no communication. 
Negation of the accretion principle. aceThere is a prevalent misconception that ibecomingem involves the notion of a unique 
seriality for its advance into novelty. This is the classic notion of time, which philosophy took over from common sense.E' 
ficeThere is a becoming of continuity but no continuity of becoming.0 No accretion: put off sense and notion. ficeThis is the 
springtime / But not in timeeTMs covenant.in / aceWhere is the summer, the unimaginable / Zero summer? Spring-time: not 
in timeATMs covenant. Space-time: not in timeaTMs covenantil 
No end, no beginning. aceNo matter how often what happened had happened any time any one told anything there was no 
repetition.03 No repetition, no competition, no emulation, no comparison, no meaning. This doesnaTMt compete with that. 
This canaTMt be a repetition of this. 
Coupling produces finite interaction: the universe is finite. No mirrors, no pictures. To measure is to disturb. The 
measurement: the coupling the matter of fact of physical phenomena: a statistical expression, the consequence of an event 
which is independent of time and place. There are no clocks, no mirrors, no place. There is no one to talk to. To live is to 
forget. aceFeign then whattirms by a decent tact believed / And act that state is only so conceived, / And build an edifice to 
form / For house where phantoms may keep warm. / Imagine, then, by miracle, with me, / (Ambiguous gifts, as what gods 
give must be) / What could not possibly be there, / And learn a style from a despair.r
