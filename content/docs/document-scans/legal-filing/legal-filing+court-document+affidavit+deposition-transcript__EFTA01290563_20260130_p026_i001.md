Important Information and Disclosures 
Pricing 
This section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including short positions, at the close of the statement period. The market prices, unless otherwise noted, 
have been obtained from independent vendor services, which we believe to be reliable. Market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ from the actual sale price. Securities for which a price M 
not available are marked 11/A" and are omitted from the Total. 
THE AS OF PRICE DATE ONLY APPEARS WHEN THE PRICE DATE DOES NOT EQUAL THE STATEMENT DATE. 
Estimated Annual Figures 
The estimated annual income (EM) and estimated annual yield (EMI figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. These figures are not considered to be a forecast or guarantee of future results. 
These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable: however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, 
and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position 
quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant. A capital gain or return of principal may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to 
Meov.pershing.comibusiness_continuity.html for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received.

not receive confirmation of these reinvestments. Upon written request to your financial institution, intonation pertaining to these transactions, including the time of execution and the name of the person from
