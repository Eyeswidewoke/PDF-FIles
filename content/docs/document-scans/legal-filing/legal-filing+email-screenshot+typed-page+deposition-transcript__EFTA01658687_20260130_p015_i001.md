Geoff Bennett said on NBC Nightly NewsVi (9/2, story 4, 1:55, Jackson, 5.53M), "The 
unclassified report published by ABC News is titled 'Russia Likely to Denigrate Health of US 
Candidates to Influence 2020 Election: It does not cite intelligence, but rather stories critical of 
Biden that aired on Russian state media." Jeff Pegues of the CBS Evening NewsVI (9/2, story 5, 
2:05, O'Donnell, 4M) reported Wolf said Wednesday that "the document didn't meet his 
standards." Wolf: "The report that you referenced was, at the end of the day, a very poorly 
written report." Pegues: "But the Democrats are concerned the Trump Administration is blocking 
the flow of key intelligence on election interference to benefit the President." The New York 
Times (9/2, Kanno-Youngs, 18.61M) reports that that officials from "the Office of Intelligence 
and Analysis briefed" Wolf "on the document sometime this summer, the department said in a 
statement." 
Wolf was asked on Fox News' Daily Briefing (9/2) to respond to accusations that DHS 
withheld the report. Wolf said, "What we do at the department every day regarding election 
security in our cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency has been hard at work on this 
for the last four years. We saw two years ago a very safe and secure election, we're continuing 
to work very hard at this leading up to November." 
Attorney General Barr was asked about Russian interference in the 2020 election on CNN 
Vi (9/2, 2.25M). Barr said, "There is some preliminary activity that suggests they may try 
again," and "it wouldn't surprise me if Russia tries something again of the same general genre 
of before." 
CNBC (9/2, Mangan, 3.62M) and NBC News (9/2, Dilanian, 6.14M), among several others, 
also report on the issue. 
Barr Says Durham Investigation Won't Affect 2020 Election. 
The Washington Examiner (9/2, Dunleavy, 448K) reports that in an interview with CNNVi (9/2, 
2.25M) Wednesday, Attorney General Barr "denied that he is being pressured by President 
Trump in his handling of U.S. Attorney John Durham's inquiry into the Russia investigation and 
claimed that any actions taken won't affect the 2020 election." Barr "stressed that the Durham 
review will abide by Justice Department guidelines. He also reiterated that, despite urging from 
Trump, former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden, who is now the 
2020 Democratic presidential nominee, are not under criminal investigation." Barr said, "I will 
handle these cases as appropriate. ... And I do not think anything that we do in the Durham 
investigation - I assume that's what you're talking about - is going to be affecting the election." 
FBI Notes From Mifsud Interview Made Public. 
The Washington Examiner (9/2, Dunleavy, 448K) reports that FBI's notes from its interview 
with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud "were made public Tuesday, showing denials from a key 
Trump-Russia inquiry figure who special counsel Robert Mueller says lied to investigators yet 
was never charged." The notes indicate that "the FBI's Feb. 11, 2017, interview with Mifsud in 
the lobby of the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C., was a brief and cursory one in the 
grand scheme of the investigation." 
Hunter Biden Holds Stake In Chinese Firm Sanctioned For Human Rights Violations. 
The Washington Free Beacon (9/2, Goodman, 78K) reports Hunter Biden holds a stake in the 
Chinese surveillance company Megvii, which is "under U.S. sanctions for human-rights 
violations, complicating his father Joe Biden's campaign promise to crack down on American 
businesses with financial ties to China's humanitarian abuses." The investment firm Bohai 
Harvest RST Shanghai Equity, in which Hunter Biden owns a stake, initially invested in Megvii 
"in 2017, according to the company's website. The firm holds a nearly 2 percent stake in Megvii 
through two holding companies, according to a prospectus filed by Megvii as part of its 
application for a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange last year." Last year, the Commerce
