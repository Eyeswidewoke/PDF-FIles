[P30] Based upon our review, we find that the trial court did not expressly apply the 
parol evidence rule when it construed the August 2001 agreement. Therefore, we find 
Hanlin-Rainaldi's contention that the trial court improperly applied the parol evidence rule 
is misplaced. 
r P31] However, to the extent that Hanlin-Rainaldi asserts that the trial court 
misconstrued or misapplied, or both, the agreement, as between Hanlin-Rainaldi and 
Jeepers, we review de novo the trial court's [**16] determination. 
r P32] [HN9] "Under North Carolina law, 'when the language of the contract is clear and 
unambiguous, construction of the agreement is a matter of law for the court[,] and the court 
cannot look beyond the terms of the contract to determine the intentions of the parties.'" 
Financial Services of Raleigh, Inc. v. Barefoot (2004), 163 N.C.App. 387, 594 S.E.2d 37, 
42, quoting Piedmont Bank & Trust Co. v. Stevenson (1986), 79 N.C.App. 236, 240, 339 
S.E.2d 49, (internal citations omitted), affirmed per curiam, 317 N.C. 330, 344 S.E.2d 788; 
see, also, Helms v. Schultze (2003), 161 N.C.App. 404, 409, 588 S.E.2d 524. Therefore, " 
'it must be presumed the parties intended what the language used clearly expresses, and 
the contract must be construed to mean what on its face it purports to mean.' " Barefoot, at

(internal citations omitted). 
[P33] According to section 5a. of the August 2001 agreement: 
Harlin, and its parent, subsidiary. and affiliate corporations, and their respective shareholders. [—in partners. 
directors, officers. employees. insurers. representatives. and agents. and their respective heirs. successors, and 
assigns, hereby release and discharge Jeepers and Concord Mills, and each of their parent, subsidiary, and affiliate 
corporations, and their respective shareholders. partners, directors, officers, employees. insurers, representatives. 
subcontractors. suppliers. and agents, and their respective heirs, successors, and assigns, and from any and all 
obligations. liabilities. damages. claims. costs. expenses. and attorneys' fees (whether known or unknown) arising out 
of or relating in any manner to the upfit of the Jeepers' facilities in the Concord Mills Mall and in Southfield. Michigan. 
[T34] Furthermore, pursuant to section 9c. of the agreement: "This Agreement 
represents the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the settlement of the 
dispute between them, and it supersedes all prior discussions, representations, and/or 
negotiations. This Agreement shall not be amended except in a writing signed by both of 
the Parties." 
[P35] Thus, applying the plain language of the agreement, we must determine whether 
Jeepers' obligation under Note ["18] 1 is an obligation, liability, claim, or cost that arises 
out of or relates in any manner to the upfit of Jeepers' facility in the Concord Mills Mall. 
r P36] Jeepers' obligation under Note 1 arose pursuant to a May 2000 agreement. Under 
this agreement, Hanlin-Rainaldi and Jeepers expressly desired to settle any and all claims 
against each other that resulted from the construction project in Concord, North Carolina. 
Pursuant to this agreement, Jeepers executed Note 1. 
[1:137] Accordingly, we conclude that Jeepers' obligation under Note 1 relates to the upfit 
of Jeepers' facility in the Concord Mills Mall, and it is an obligation that arises out of or 
relates to the upfit of the construction project in the Concord Mills Mall. 
[*P38] Because Jeepers' obligation under Note 1 arises out of or relates to the upfit of the 
construction project in the Concord Mills Mall, we further conclude, as a matter of law, that
