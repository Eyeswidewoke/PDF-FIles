Do you mean that hope is not about the present state (zero order), the =isible trend of the present state (first order), 
but about changes in =hat trend (second order)? 
I don't yet understand how that is significant. 
When we model the future, we extrapolate the present into a number of =rajectories. We tend to fail, not only because 
or lack of information, =r because the world is often non-linear or chaotic, but because the =pace in which these 
trajectories play out does not have a fixed =imensionality. The eigenvectors that characterize the future universe =ill 
usually be different from those of the past; e.g. a universe with =oogle and social media is constituted differently than 
one without =hem. 
In my view, hope refers to the possibility of entering trajectories with =ositive valence in a universe in which many 
trajectories have negative =alence. 
Hope is a representation of the indication that we should invest into a =ubset of the available action space. As soon as 
we have given up hope =or that subset of the action space, we should stop investing in it, =ecause it won't yield any 
conceivable return. 
While the hope construct can be used to model rational investments, it =ften does not approximate the actual 
distribution of expectations, =ecause many of the expected trajectories mean death, or something =ufficiently close to 
death that they can be ignored, i.e. they don't =arrant any possible further consideration in the view of the agent. 
=nstead, hope distributes the investments along those trajectories that =ave acceptable valence, even if they are very 
unlikely. 
Using hope instead of rationality for modeling the future is dangerous =hen we are not an individual agent but a society. 
For instance, if we =uild our models of future development of the climate on hope, we will =e cutting off investments 
into the death and near-death trajectories, =ven if those are not unlikely. 
Based on that thought, I would for instance suggest building a =epository of knowledge for bootstrapping epistemology, 
civilization and =eneral Al for future non-human civilizations, i.e. those that will =pring off long after all large mammalian 
species are wiped out by a =uper volcano, meteor, global warming, nuclear war or bad Al =ingularity. It might make 
sense to put a few copies in orbit, and a few =nderground, perhaps equipped with broadcasting facilities that announce 
=he presence of the repository every few hundred years. (Not that I have =ny reasonable priors from which I could 
derive the rationality of such =n investment, but it could be fun.)

maybe
