Deutsche Bank 
Risks 
■ Bovis Homes - BVS.L: Downside risks include the lesser availability and 
affordability of mortgages, which is a determinant of housing demand. 
Economic factors such as the higher unemployment rate and consumer 
confidence also have a demand influence. Political factors such as lower 
government funding and policy on planning have an influence on demand 
and supply. Company-specific risks include the later timing and lower 
profitability of new land including some large strategic land sites, lesser 
control of material and labour costs, and the slower timing and lower profits 
from the sale of parcels of land on larger sites 
■ Carrefour - CARR.PA: Key upside risks include: 1) sustainable market 
share gains in France, 2) strong economic rebound in Brazil, due to crisis 
resolution and 3) faster-than-expected ramp-up of converted DIA stores in 
France 
■ Credit Suisse Group - CSGN.S: Key downside risks include challenging 
capital market conditions, widening credit spreads, CHF strength, higher 
wind-down losses and litigation charges. 
■ Continental AG - CONG.DE: Key risks include a worsening volume 
environment, especially in Europe given Continental's regional exposure, 
and higher operational gearing to the downside due to a higher fixed cost 
base and revenue per unit (DBe); as well as a weaker tire demand and 
pricing and higher raw material headwind. For our estimates, we work with 
the following assumptions: for the tire market (DBe: -25-30% gearing on 
volume, biggest impact from pricing, mix around 1/3 to the bottom line). In 
our analysis, the gearing to the downside in automotive exceeds the usual 
15-20% gearing to the upside (DBe). 
■ Deutsche Lufthansa AG - LHAG.DE: Aside from general sector, 
macroeconomic and political issues, we see the following potential downside risks 
for Lufthansa: (i) the EU Commission attempting to block the Air Berlin deal, (ii) 
an inability to realize synergies quickly, or at all, and (iii) increased entry into 
German domestic from more aggressive airline competitors. 
■ DSM NV - DSMN.AS: There are several downside risks. For the GDP-sensitive 
industrially focused businesses, such as Materials, macro weakness could lead to 
lower forecasts and potentially valuation. For Nutrition, increased competition 
would lead to pressure on prices and volumes and negatively affect our forecasts 
and valuation. For the group, higher energy or raw materials costs would also 
potentially impact our forecasts and valuation. A sustained weakening in the US$ 
against the Euro and/or strengthening of the CHF could also impact earnings and 
potentially valuation. Last but not least, M&A not happening or value destructive 
M&A in a context on high asset prices is another risk. 
■ Eutelsat Communications - ETL.PA: Upside risks: unexpected growth in 
consumer broadband, pricing growth on video hotspots, accelerating TV channel 
launches and accelerating EM pay-TV subscriber growth, strong uptake of 3D 
and Ultra HD, unexpectedly strong demand from military and governmental 
organisations, lower-than-expected CAPEX. 
■ Fresenius - FREG.DE: General downside risks relate to healthcare reform and 
austerity with negative consequences for Fresenius. Company specific downside 
risks relate to rising cost inflation not adequately covered by reimbursement (e.g. 
for dialysis in the US), M&A integration (e.g. Qiransalud, Care Coordination deals) 
and/or overpaying for potential future acquisitions, more-than-expected easing of 
drug shortages in the US and/or production issues at Kabi, rising competition 
and/or less-than-expected new products, lack of cost savings, and FX.
