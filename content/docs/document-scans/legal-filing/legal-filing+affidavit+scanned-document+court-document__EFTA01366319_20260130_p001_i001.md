and. if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of cocoa! securities in a 
particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of 
securities issued by blank check companies. other than the state of Idaho. certain state securities regulators view 
blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers. to hinder the 
sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on NASDAQ, our 
securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer 
our securities. 
You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to in% estors of many other blank check companies. 
Since the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are intended to be used 
to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has 
32 
not been identified, we may be deemed to be a "blank chock" company under the United States securities laws. 
However, because we will have net tangible assets in excess of $5.000,000 upon the successful completion of this 
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an 
audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect 
investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or 
protections of those rules. Among other things. this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will 
have a longer period of time to complete our business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. 
Moreover, if this offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on 
funds held in the must account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in 
connection with our completion of an initial business combination. For a more detailed comparison of our 
offering to offerings that comply with Rule 419, please see "Proposal Business—Comparison of This Offering to 
Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419.-
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions 
pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a "group" of stockholders are deemed to hold In excess of 
10% of our common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 10% of our 
common stock. 
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in 
connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or 
any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a "group" (as defined under Section 13 of 
the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 
10% of the shares sold in this offering, which we refer to as the "Excess Shares." However, we would not be 
restricting our stockholders' ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business 
combination. Your inability tot 
coo the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete 
our business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares 
in open market transactions. Additionally. you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the 
Excess Shares if we complete our business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of 
shares exceeding 10% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your stock in open market 
transactions, potentially at a loss. 
Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it 
may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our 
Initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 510.00 per share, on 
our redemption, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, 
including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships). other blank check companies 
and other entities. domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of 
these individuals and entities arc well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, 
directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of 
these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we 
do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. 
While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this 
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of 
certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent 
competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition 
33 
of certain target businesses. Furthermore, if we are obligated to pay cast for the shares of common stock 
redeemed and, in the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination. we make purchases of our
