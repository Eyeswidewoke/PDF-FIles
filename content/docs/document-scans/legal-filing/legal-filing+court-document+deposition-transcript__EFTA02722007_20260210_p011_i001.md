beginning of the 'War on Terror', at least as far as support to Kabul was concerned. In order 
to achieve some sort of stability in Afghanistan as quickly as possible, the Iranians did not 
hesitate to put some pressure on the Northern Alliance during the Bonn Conference. They 
made sure that their Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara allies would accept the leadership of Hamid 
Karzai, with whom they did not want to share power at first. On this issue again, the US and 
Iran were having the same vision: a more centralised Afghanistan in order to give the 
stabilisation of the country a better chance.07 Moreover, during the 2002 Tokyo conference, 
Iran was one of the most generous developing nations, as it pledged US$560million towards 
Afghan reconstruction.48
Hence, recent history tells us that chaos in Afghanistan has always meant direct or indirect 
problems for Tehran. It also shows that the Iranians do act rationally to ensure their 
neighbour's stability. Of course, it is possible to imagine that Iran would want to have some 
influence on a country that has been such a source of problems. But it can hardly be called 
'Iranian imperialismi°9, rather a realist measure of self-preservation and preservation of its 
interests. This explains why Iran appeared to be part of the solution, and not part of the 
problem, when the Bush administration wanted to get rid of the 'Afghan Emirate'. At worst, 
Iran can be described, after the fall of the Taliban, as a realist state, eager to protect its 
national interest, and its national interest required stability in its neighbourhood. 
Iran Today: Good or Bad Neighbour? 
A General View 
With such recent history as the background, how can one define the Iranian policy towards 
Afghanistan after those promising beginnings? 
As already seen, it is difficult to imagine that Iran would have had the desire to create any 
problems for its neighbour, once it got rid of the Taliban. Probably more than any other 
nation, Iran wanted a stabilised neighbour that would be neither 'rogue' nor 'failed' in scope, 
i.e. a state that could be a source of opportunities rather than a curse. It explains why (former 
US President) George W. Bush's labelling of Iran as part of the 'Axis of Evil' (29 January 
2002), shocked the Iranians who saw that as an unnecessary humiliation. Especially because 
of the company they found themselves in. They had no love for (former Iraq President)

particular those who have been close to the former Bush Administration. This is the case of Bernard Lewis, 
for example. See Gholamani Khoshroo, 'The Great Threat and Bernard Lewis' Nightmare', Iran Review, 7
