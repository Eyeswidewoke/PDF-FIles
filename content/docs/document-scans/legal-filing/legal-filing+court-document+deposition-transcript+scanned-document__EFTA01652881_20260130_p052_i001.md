Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 181-2 Filed 06/22/23 Page 4 of 13 
INTENTION TO APPEAR 
written objection, you may (but you do not have to) attend the hearing. 
DO NOTHING 
As a Class Member, you are not required to apply for any funds from the 
Settlement. You may instead choose to do nothing and you will not receive 
any payment. You will, however, still be a Class Member, which means that 
you give up your right to ever be part of any other lawsuit against the 
Defendant or any other Released Defendant Party about the legal claims 
being resolved by this Settlement and you will be bound by any judgments or 
orders entered by the Court in the Litigation. 
SUMMARY OF THIS NOTICE 
Description of the Litigation and the Class 
This Notice relates to a proposed settlement of claims in a pending class action brought by victims of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein's ("Epstein") sex trafficking venture, which alleged, among other things, that Defendant violated the Trafficking 
Victims Protection Act ("TVPA") by providing and his associates with the ability to withdraw large sums of cash and 
access to wire services and failing in their compliance and regulatory obligations to report suspicious conduct by Epstein 
and his associates. A more detailed description of the Litigation is set forth on page 4 below. The proposed Settlement, if 
approved by the Court, will settle claims of all Class Members. 
Statement of Class Recovery 
Pursuant to the Settlement described herein, a $290 million settlement fund has been established (the "Global 
Settlement Amount"). The Global Settlement Amount, together with any interest earned thereon, will be deposited in a 
"Qualified Settlement Fund." The Qualified Settlement Fund, less (a) any taxes, (b) any Notice and Administration 
Expenses, and (c) any attorneys' fees and litigation costs, charges, and expenses (including any award to the Class 
Representative of her costs and expenses in representing the Class) awarded by the Court, and interest thereon, is the "Net 
Settlement Fund." The Net Settlement Fund will be distributed to Class Members in accordance with a plan of allocation 
described in the Stipulation of Settlement and below on pages a ("Plan of Allocation"). Distribution under the Plan of 
Allocation will vary based on each Participating Claimant's submissions to the Claims Administrator. Class Members 
should note that any particular distribution is not guaranteed. A Class Member's actual recovery will be determined by 
the information provided to the Class Administrator. See Plan of Allocation set forth and discussed at page 5 below for 
more information on the calculation of your claim. 
Statement of Potential Outcome of Case 
The Settling Parties disagree on both liability and damages and do not agree on the amount of damages, if any, that 
would be recoverable if the Class prevailed on each claim alleged. Defendant denies that they are liable to the Class and 
deny that the Class has suffered any injury or damages. The issues on which the parties disagree are many but include: (I) 
whether Defendant engaged in conduct that would give rise to any liability to the Class under the TVPA; (2) whether 
Defendant has valid defenses to any such claims of liability; (3) the appropriate economic model for determining the 
amount of damages (if at all) suffered during the Class Period; (4) the extent to which (if at all) Defendant was negligent; 
and (5) the extent to which (if at all) Defendant's conduct obstructed government investigation into Epstein's sex 
trafficking venture. 
Statement of Attorneys' Fees and Expenses Sought 
Boies Schiller Flexner LLP ("BSF") and Edwards Henderson Lehrman ("EHL") as Class Counsel will apply to the 
Court for an award of attorneys' fees not to exceed thirty percent (30%) of the Global Settlement Amount plus costs, 
charges, and expenses not to exceed $2,500,000.00 plus interest earned on both amounts at the same rate as earned by the 
Global Settlement Fund. Since being named Class Counsel, BSF and EHL have expended considerable time and effort in 
the prosecution of this Litigation on a wholly contingent basis and have advanced the expenses of the Litigation in the 
expectation that if they were successful in obtaining a recovery for the Class they would be paid from such recovery.
