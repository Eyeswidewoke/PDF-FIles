With the reduction of global tail risks, EMFX is still 
attractive as a carry proposition due to elevated 
interest rate differentials and reduced volatility.

In some cases, government intervention will 
continue to have an important influence on short-
term FX movements. 
• 
We still recommend short EUR/BRL and short 
EUR/CLP as carry trades. While we remain 
constructive on MXN in the medium term we 
recommend tactically taking profits. 
The noticeable reduction of Eurozone tail risks has 
helped EM currencies to become less sensitive to 
EUR/USD movements. With still relatively better growth 
perspectives, and in many cases, elevated interest rate 
differentials, EM currencies maintain some residual 
allure in this environment of reduced volatility. 
Nevertheless, as the deterioration of fundamentals 
slowly spreads from the core to the periphery, 
differentiation begins to play a more prominent role. 
Despite some overvaluation and, in some cases, 
deterioration in external accounts, capital inflows on 
the back of persistent monetary accommodation at the 
core should help to avoid any important correction, at 
least in the near term. Aggressive FX intervention could 
be problematic when central banks are more worried 
about 
losing 
competitiveness 
amid 
sputtering 
economic growth than the potential inflationary effects 
of weaker currencies. 
The BRL is a clear example of a central bank stepping 
in front of weakening fundamentals. In our view, the 
BRL will remain range bound due to official 
intervention, offering an attractive carry/volatility 
combination. The lukewarm interest rate hiking cycle, 
when inflation dynamics are all but comfortable, 
indirectly imposes greater constraints on acceptable FX 
depreciation. Even though the FX pass-through is 
relatively low in Brazil, and fundamental drivers are 
pointing toward further depreciation, the central bank 
has already signaled that it does not want to face any 
risks on the inflation front by promptly intervening 
when it considers necessary. We thus continue 
recommending short EUR/BRL to maintain a long BRL 
exposure as a carry trade (current: 2.60, entry: 2.56, 
target: 2.45, stop: 2.64). 
In contrast, MXN is an example 
of 
positive 
differentiation. Mexican assets continued to benefit 
Deutscho Bank AG/London 
from the combination of excess global liquidity amid a 
weakening global environment, in which it is becoming 
increasingly difficult to find a good story on 
fundamentals like Mexico's engaging in long-due 
structural reforms. An anticipated credit upgrade (by 
Fitch) and political signals for the continuation of the 
reform agenda pushed the MXN to break the critical 12 
level in the last few days. Even though the structural 
backdrop is sound, we believe that the short-term 
upside potential of the MXN is now limited. The 
gradual materialization of the reform agenda and the 
inevitable recovery in the US will certainly provide 
some medium-term support for the currency. In the 
short run, however, heavy positioning and potential 
transitory increase in risk aversion could induce a 
temporary break in the appreciation trend.
