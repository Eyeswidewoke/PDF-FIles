No, Virginia, there is no Santa Claus....or at feast it feels that way sometimes 
In a fitting finish to what has been a difficult past 6 months, CIE unexpectedly 
reported a dry hole at US GoM prospect, Aegean. At this point, valuation has 
taken a back seat, as lack of confidence in the story, fund flows, year-end 
derisking, tax-loss selling, lack of catalysts and general frustration have the 
stock trading well below our $22/sh estimate of discovered resource ($15/sh of 
US GoM discovered resource). While valuation remains extremely attractive, 
we expect the stock to struggle in the near-term as the market wrestles with 
the value of discovered resource and potential paths to monetization, but see 
value for those able to withstand near-term volatility. Maintain Buy. 
Enter the debate. What is discovered resource? And what rs it worth? 
In our view, for the time being the stock has flipped from a "resource-plus" 
model (ie. discovered resource plus some risked value for future exploration) to 
a "discount to resource" model. With significant disagreement on discovered 
resource, however, we see a couple of potential paths towards greater clarity: 
1) Improved transparency on discovered barrels - CIE has given little 
clarity on discovered resource, and would benefit greatly from some 
disclosure on resource ranges and accompanying geologic scenarios. 
(see "Cameia", where many attribute 200-250 mmboe, the company's 
"minimum threshold", despite what is clearly a much larger deposit. 
2) Monetization - CIE is clearly on the path towards monetization in the 
form of "farm-downs" as a funding vehicle, but these are likely 
contingent on additional appraisal activity at Shenandoah and North 
Platte, making monetization likely a 2015 event. We would expect to 
see some rising pressure on the company to act earlier to arbitrage the 
gap between GoM asset deals and current CIE valuation. 
We expect a more proactive approach from the company on the first point in 
2014, but remain skeptical of the company's willingness to leave money on the 
table through an accelerated sale. However, with the stock trading at a 34% 
discount to DBe's $22ish of discovered resource, and a $0.50/sh discount to 
the US GoM alone, expect continued market pressure on both avenues. 
Whar happened? And What's nevt? PT from 832 to $25 
CIE reported a dry hole at the Aegean prospect in the US GoM (CIE 60%. Total 
40%), a three-way trap targeting the inboard Lower Tertiary. CIE will now 
release the Ensco 8503 rig. Upcoming targets include Bicuar (late 10/2O) and 
Orca (2O14) in Angola, as well as three non-operated US GoM wells in 2014: 
CVX's Anchor (11114, CIE 24%), BHP's Rum Ramsey (21114, CIE 24%) and 
ENI's Goodfellow (21114, CIE 30%). We have reduced our PT from $32 to $25 
to account for -$2.50 of risked Aegean value and higher risk to future 
exploration.
