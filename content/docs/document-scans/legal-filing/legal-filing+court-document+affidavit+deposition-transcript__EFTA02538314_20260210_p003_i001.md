Dan has reduced the ask from $84 million to $64 mi=lion. Evidently appraisals were made by TD and NPCM in 
January that were in the $.0s. Dan has asked that the TD appraisal be revised because of Moens sale of 125= S Ocean 
(the ex Krakoff lot) to the south for $22.7+ to Petterfy. (Swanson pa=d $20.6 for the land at 1220.) He thinks/hopes 1220 
will now appraise in the $50s. 
The nearest competitio= is Sandra Hammond's house at 1275 SOB listed by Cris Condon of Sotheby's at $42.5= I 
do not think there have been offers. Swanson sold the house to Hammond from pl=ns. It recorded as a $15M land sale 
but she is supposed to have paid more than =26M in total. Interestingly, Petterfy got interested in the land at 1255 while 
looking at 1275. 1275 has 13,300 sf on 170 lakefront feet (270 depth) and i= basically a smaller version of 1220 (27.350 
sf on 200+ feet 
The sense of the PB brokers is that 1220 will brin= a $40 number. 
There has been a lot of activity in PB this season in the $20-$30 range (sales and offers). But the fact is that so 
far the high sale this season will be $29.= for 40 Blossom Way (190 feet on the ocean) which (Moens says) Moens and 
his partner (Bill Kallop) are buying and leasing to Petterfy for 5 years while he builds on 1255 which th=y owned and sold 
to him. 
Discussion 
Dan is shell-shocked. He doesn't think Kosoy wil= extend the second so he fears losing 1220 in November before 
next season provides an opportunity to sell it. I don't think he is likely to have many alternati=es over the summer. 
Its obvious that one could structure a second with=a high rate of interest and an interest reserve. I think Dan 
would agree. The comb=ned first and second would at $30,200,000 represent 75% loan to expected sales value ratio - 
poss=bly a lower ratio if appraised value is used. 
Since 1220 is owned by a single asset LLC, there seem to be some obvious techniques to limit exposure to delays 
i= possession on default or in the event of an LLC bankruptcy including =/span>taking a membership position in the LLC 
and amending the operating agreement to require consent to certain actions like bankruptcy, s=le and refinancings. 
Taking an LLC membership position in addition to the =ortgage could also be a vehicle for a profit participation in the 
event of a successful sale. Given the LLC's position, the FMV o= an equity position would be modest. 
If Dan (the LLC) defaulted, and the second mortgag= holder acquired the first for $20,200,000, then it would 
have $30,200,000 in. If the house =old at $40 million=or slightly above, it would represent a return of $10 millio= (plus 
interest) in a year on a $10,000,000 debt position.
