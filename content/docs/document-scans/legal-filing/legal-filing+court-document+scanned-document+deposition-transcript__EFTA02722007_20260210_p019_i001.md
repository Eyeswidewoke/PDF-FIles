any state aimed at us, we have the inherent right of self-defence and will employ it'. The 
Ambassador has insisted on this notion of self-defence, hoping that `the region takes notice'. 
Again, it sounds like a veiled threat to Pakistan, but that could also be a message for Iran". 
Proof that Pakistan was not the only state targeted in this discourse appeared soon enough 
after 2 May, 2012. The timing of events in the month of May 2012 is, in fact, very 
enlightening on the Afghan position towards Iran78. Each of those events looks like an 
exaggeration of Iranian intent to influence Afghanistan. And it clearly illustrates how the 
Afghan-Iran relationship could become hostage to American-Iranian tensions. 
Three days after the signature of the agreement, Abdulvahed Hakimi, Kabul bureau chief for 
the Iranian Fars news agency79, was arrested, and accused of passing classified documents to 
Tehran. Of course, as far as one can know, this is just a claim, impossible to verify 
independently for the time being8°. Very quickly after this event, two other persons were 
arrested, Afghan nationals this time. Radio Free Europe has been able to obtain a video 
where the two Afghans (who were allegedly trained to organise terrorist actions) confessed. 
But as explained in the article describing this video, `RFE/RL cannot independently verify 
the claims made in the video or the circumstances under which the video was recorded'8t. 
The Afghans on tape talk about a rather extraordinary story that they were trained to be spies 
and terrorists working for the Revolutionary Guards, with training in Iran with Lebanese, 
Iraqis and other Afghans by the Pasdaran. The latter organisation wants to rejuvenate 
Hekmatyar's group82. The weapons shown in the video, as well as the claims of the two 
Afghans "confessing", as in the video, give the impression that Iran is really active in 
destabilising Afghanistan through terror. But it does not make sense, if one keeps in mind the 
long-term foreign policy of Tehran towards Kabul. Accessing only on open sources, and 
with the timing of this 'episode' in mind, the information can at least be seen with some

7° Which has tics with the Iranian government. The Wall Street Journal goes as far as to say that it is affiliated 
to the Pasdaran or Revolutionary Guards, an affirmation quite difficult to verify independently. See Farnaz

8° The fact that journalists, academic researchers, or travelling entrepreneurs. are used for information 
gathering is not new or surprising. But the accusation made by the Afghans against Hakimi is much more 
serious.

82 A claim that does not go well with what has been narrated earlier in this paper: Hekmatyar has not been 
financed by the Iranians to revive his group. In same way the Taliban cannot be seen as a creation of the 
Pakistanis alone, it is rather simplistic to imagine that Hezb-i-lslami is just a tool of the Iranians.
