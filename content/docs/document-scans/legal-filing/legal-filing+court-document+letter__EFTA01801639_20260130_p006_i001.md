ra=her rigid rules inserted at the last minute by the European Parliament int= the European CRD4 Directive applying 
ratios for fixed and bonus pay at Eu=opean banks. But in doing so he is well aware that he is badly out of step with the 
public mood. 
The accountability problem is as simple and blunt as poli=ics gets. The massive market disruptions of 
2008 and the ensuing economic =risis have created a latent political desire for personal accountability f=om the banking 
industry that it has so far been unable to meet. In part this is because the most egregiously m=naged institutions in the 
period leading up to 2008 have simply disappeare=. The survivors are generally not inclined to feel implicated in the 
indus=ry's wider collective problems. Mr Diamond always seemed to hint at the indignation of an executive whose =ank 
had survived the banking crisis without direct government support and =ho felt he had little to answer for, at least until 
his employees' malpr=ctice made this untenable. This is part of what made him such a lightning rod and figure of 
resentment for ma=y politicians. 
The political fal=out 
How will this play out politically? The UK's Labour opp=sition has clearly judged that there is mileage in a 
renewed campaign agai=st the bankers. However, although Labour supports a tightening of the gove=nment's proposed 
rules on derivatives inside the ringfence for British retail banks proposed for 2013, its ultim=te aim is not a particular 
regulatory outcome but something closer to a mo=al posture on capitalism. Labour leader Ed Miliband has broadly 
disowned t=e banking record of the Labour government before 2010 and has put a "better, improved capitalism" at =he 
heart of his election platform. This is achieving some resonance in the=media. His aim is to use a moral and ethical 
critique of banking as a way =f differentiating himself and the Labour party both from its own past and the Conservative-
led Coalition government= The Coalition government inevitably will be forced to cover the same grou=d. 
The Conservative party is much less inclined to make a mo=al issue of banking, still less of capitalism 
more widely. However, most o= the very small number of genuinely forensic critics of the banking sector=in the UK 
Parliament are Tories, and often individuals with financial services backgrounds. The Chancellor =eorge Osborne 
currently seems more inclined to use the LIBOR issue as an orportunity to attack Labour's record in government, but if 
other banks ar= fined and the Parliamentary enquiry is highly critical, then he will have to tack to stay close enough to 
the =ublic mood. His own backbenchers have already started to grumble that he h=s misjudged the LIBOR scandal by 
playing it for politics rather than a que=tion of principle and policy. 
For an industry that is used to justifying its social rol= largely in terms of taxes paid and jobs created, this 
is difficult territ=ry. Assuming that banks accept that there is a need seriously to tac=le and talk about internal culture, 
providing evidence of this response is not easy. It will require bank leaders who ar= more visible, vocal and accountable, 
and internal management that is will=ng to pit the long term interests of institutions against the short-term c=lture of 
the trading floor. 
For boards, and in particular the many non-executive boar= members of banks charged with providing 
external oversight of institution=l conduct and compensation, this adds both additional responsibility and a=ditional 
exposure. It will require a keen political ear. But it will also require politicians and regulators =o engage in a more subtle 
debate about culture. And care by politicians th=t their desire to curb unacceptable behaviour does not spill over into a 
t=reat to the existence and competitiveness of the banking sector as a whole. 
By falling on his sword Mr Diamond has created the possib=lity of a rapprochement between his bank 
and British political opinion for=ers. The bigger issue for the bank he leaves behind and others like it is =ow — or if — it is 
possible to rebuild political and regulatory confidence in the kind of financial markets busin=sses he dedicated his career 
to building and the people who run and profit=from them.
