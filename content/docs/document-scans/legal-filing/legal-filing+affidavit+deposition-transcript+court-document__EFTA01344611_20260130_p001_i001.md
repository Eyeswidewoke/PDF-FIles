determine the Reference Currency Return using its normal means. The resulting discretion by the Calculation Agent in 
determining the Reference Currency Return could, in turn, result in potential conflicts of interest. 
co WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE REFERENCE CURRENCY AND THE 
U.S. DOLLAR — Foreign exchange rates can either float or be fixed by sovereign governments. Exchange rates of the currencies 
used by most economically developed nations are pennitted to fluctuate in value relative to the U.S. Dollar and to each other. 
However, from time to time, governments may use a variety of techniques, such as intervention by a central bank, the imposition 
of regulatory controls or taxes or changes in interest rates to influence the exchange rates of their currencies. Governments may 
also issue a new currency to replace an existing currency or alter the exchange rate or relative exchange characteristics by a 
devaluation or revaluation of a currency. These governmental actions could change or interfere with currency valuations and 
currency fluctuations that would othenvise occur in response to economic forces, as well as in response to the movement of 
currencies across borders. As a consequence, these government actions could adversely affect an investment in the Notes which 
are affected by the exchange rate between the Reference Currency and the U.S. Dollar. 
a THE PAYMENT FORMULA FOR THE NOTES WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL DEVELOPMENTS IN 
THE REFERENCE CURRENCY — Changes in the Reference Currency during the term of the Notes other than on the Final 
Valuation Date may not he reflected in the calculation of the Payment at Maturity. The Reference Currency Return will be 
calculated only as of the Final Valuation Date. As a result, the Reference Currency Return may be less than zero even if the 
Reference Currency had moved favorably at certain times during the term of the Notes before moving to an unfavorable level on 
the Final Valuation Date. 
co THE NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO EMERGING MARKETS' POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS — The Reference 
Currency is the currency of an emerging market country•. Emerging market countries are more exposed to the risk of swill political 
change and economic downturns than their industrialized counterparts. In recent years, emerging markets have undergone 
significant political, economic and social change. Such far-reaching political changes have resulted in constitutional and social 
tensions, and, in some cases, instability and reaction against market reforms have occurred. With respect to any emerging or 
developing nation, there is the possibility of nationalization, expropriation or confiscation, political changes, government 
regulation and social instability. There can be no assurance that future political changes will not adversely affect the economic 
conditions of an emerging or developing-market nation. Political or economic instability is likely to have an adverse effect on the 
performance of the Reference Currency, and, consequently, the return on the Notes. 
co THE NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK — Foreign currency exchange rates vary over time, and 
may vary considerably during the term of the Notes. The relative values of the U.S. Dollar and the Reference Currency arc at any 
moment a result of the supply and demand for such currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates result over time from 
the interaction of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political developments in other relevant countries. Of 
particular importance to currency exchange risk are: 
co existing and expected rates of inflation; 
co existing and expected interest rate levels; 
co the balance of payments in the United States and Mexico between each country and its major trading partners; and 
co the extent of governmental surplus or deficit in the United States and Mexico. 
Each of these factors, among others, are sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade policies pursued by the United States, Mexico, 
and those of other countries important to international trade and fmance. 
CO NO INTEREST PAYMENTS — As a holder of the Notes, you will not receive interest payments. 
co POTENTIALLY INCONSISTENT RESEARCH, OPINIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS BY HSBC AND JPMORGAN 
— HSBC, JPMorgan, or their respective affiliates may publish research, express opinions or provide recommendations that arc 
inconsistent with investing in or holding the Notes and which may be revised at any time. Any such research, opinions or 
recommendations could affect the exchange rate between the Reference Currency and the U.S. Dollar, and therefore, the market 
value of the Notes. 
coCERTAIN BUILT-IN COSTS ARE LIKELY TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE NOTES PRIOR TO 
MATURITY — While the Payment at Maturity described in this pricing supplement is based on the full Principal Amount of 
your Notes, the original issue price of the Notes includes the placement agent's commission and the estimated cost of hedging our 
obligations under the Notes through one or more of our affiliates. As a result, the price, if any, at which HSBC Securities (USA) 
Inc. will be willing to purchase Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if at all, will likely be lower than the original 
issue price, and any sale of Notes by you prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. The Notes are not 
designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.
