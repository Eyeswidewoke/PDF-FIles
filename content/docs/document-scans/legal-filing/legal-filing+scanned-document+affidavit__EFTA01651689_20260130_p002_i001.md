this week set off a flurry of media inquiries. The arrest served as a great outcome for this multi-year 
investigation thanks to the hard work and patience of the CY-6 case team. 
Congrats to CD-20 who charged Pierre Girgis, a Capital One banker, for Acting as an Unregistered Agent of the 
Egyptian Government. Girgis is a dual Egyptian and US citizen who covertly gathered non-public intelligence 
about the activities of political opponents of Egypt's president, planned delegations at the behest of foreign 
officials, and took direct tasking from Egyptian officials against US interests. This five year investigation utilized 
almost every national security and criminal technique available. Great work CD-20. 
We saw some great results in a C-11 investigation as Steven Brown, aka "BI," the leader of a violent Bronx drug 
crew, the Taylor Avenue Crew, was sentenced to 260 months in prison for participating in the August 2, 2009, 
murder of 22-year old rival gang member Derrick Moore. In addition to the prison term, Brown was sentenced 
to five years of supervised release and $6,445 in restitution. The Taylor Avenue Crew was a criminal enterprise 
that controlled crack cocaine sales principally in and around the Bronx from at least 2007 up to and including 
2015. The Taylor Avenue Crew also committed acts of violence in the area against rival gangs, including 
assaults, attempted murder, and murder. In August 2009, after escalating violence between the Taylor Avenue 
Crew and a rival crew, Brown ordered the murder of Moore. To carry out the murder, Brown requested the 
assistance of the Creston Avenue Crew, whose members then shot and killed Moore. Great work by C-11 on 
this long investigation! 
C-24 has been hard at work investigating a conspiracy to dope racehorses with performance enhancing drugs, 
which involved drug adulteration and misbranding. On January 5, 2021, in the SDNY, Kristian Rhein, a 
Thoroughbred veterinarian, was sentenced to three years in prison, $1,021,800 in forfeiture, and $729,716 in 
restitution. On January 6, 2021, Michael Kegley Jr., an executive at Medivet Equine, a drug distribution 
company, was sentenced to 30 months in prison and $3,310,490 in forfeiture. To date, 21 defendants have pled 
guilty, two defendants have received deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs), one defendant is a fugitive, and 
13 defendants are still going through the legal process. Notably, on December 17, 2021, Jorge Navarro, a 
thoroughbred racehorse trainer, was sentenced in the SDNY to five years in prison, $70,000 in forfeiture, and 
$25.8 million in restitution for his part in the conspiracy. On December 21, 2021, Rebecca Linke, a Standardbred 
racehorse veterinarian, entered into a DPA for two years of probation and a clause that forbids her from 
working with racehorses. This has been a complicated investigation that required a lot of creativity by C-24. 
Their efforts will not only hold these individuals accountable for their actions but will help to address the 
corruption challenges on an entire industry. Well donel 
On December 29th , a jury found Ghislaine Maxwell guilty of facilitating and participating in the sexual abuse of 
children. She engaged in these horrific acts with her long time companion, Jeffrey Epstein. As you have likely 
heard, we are working with the Southern District of New York to investigate recent media reporting 
regarding some of the jurors in this investigation. I do not know if this will have any effect on the prosecution of 
Maxwell. Regardless of these issues, however, I want to commend the incredible work by C-20 to investigate 
both Maxwell and Epstein. C-20's efforts demonstrate clearly that we are committed to protecting the 
victims of crime, regardless of how much time has passed or how much effort is required. Protecting the rights 
of victims must always be a priority for us, in every investigation and for every violation we work This is 
particularly true for the work done by our Crimes Against Children task force. Thanks to C-20 for your hard 
work, dedication, and for helping to seek justice for these victims. 
Have a great weekend.
