12. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for 
payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by 
Lender to Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability 
of Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence 
proceedings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or 
otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any 
demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance 
by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of 
payments from third persons, entities or Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than 
the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy. 
13. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants 
and agrees that Borrower's obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any 
Borrower who co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note (a "co-signer"): (a) is 
co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey the co-signer's interest in the 
Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums 
secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to 
extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security 
Instrument or the Note without the co-signer's consent. 
Subject to the provisions of Section IS, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes 
Borrower's obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall 
obtain all of Borrower's rights and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be 
released from Borrower's obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender 
agrees to such release in writing. The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall 
bind (except as provided in Section 20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender. 
14. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with 
Borrower's default, for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under 
this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, attorneys fees, property inspection and 
valuation fees. In regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security 
Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the 
charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security 
Instrument or by Applicable Law. 
If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted 
so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan 
exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary 
to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which 
exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by 
reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund 
reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment 
charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower's acceptance 
of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of 
action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge. 
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must 
be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to
