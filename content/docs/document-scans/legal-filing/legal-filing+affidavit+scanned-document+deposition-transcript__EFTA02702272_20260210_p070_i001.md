proceeding for any remedy available to the guarantee trustee in respect of such preferred securities guarantee or 
to direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the guarantee trustee under such preferred securities 
guarantee. (Section 5.4) 
If the guarantee trustee fails to enforce the preferred securities guarantee, any holder of the preferred 
securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against us to enforce its rights under such preferred securities 
guarantee without first instituting a legal proceeding against the trust, the guarantee trustee or any other person or 
entity. (Section 5.4) 
We, as guarantor, are required to file annually with the guarantee trustee a certificate as to whether or not 
we are in compliance with all the conditions and covenants applicable to us under the preferred securities 
guarantee. (Section 2.4) 
Information Concerning the Guarantee Trustee 
The guarantee trustee, other than during the occurrence and continuance of a default by us in performance of 
any preferred securities guarantee, undertakes to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in the 
preferred securities guarantee and, after default with respect to any preferred securities guarantee, must exercise 
the same degree of care and skill as a prudent person would exercise or use in the conduct of his or her own 
affairs. (Section 3.1) Subject to this provision, the guarantee trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the 
powers vested in it by any preferred securities guarantee at the request of any holder of any preferred securities 
unless it is offered reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses, and liabilities that might be incurred 
thereby. (Section 3.2) 
Termination of the Preferred Securities Guarantee 
The preferred securities guarantee will terminate and be of no further force and effect upon: 
• 
full payment of the redemption price of the preferred securities: 
• 
the distribution of the corresponding subordinated debt securities to the holders of the preferred 
securities: or 
• 
upon full payment of the amounts payable upon liquidation of the trust. 
The preferred securities guarantee will continue to be effective or will be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any 
time any holder of the preferred securities must restore payment of any sums paid with respect to such preferred 
securities or such preferred securities guarantee. (Section 7.1) 
New York Law to Govern 
The preferred securities guarantee will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the 
State of New York applicable to agreements made and performed wholly in that state. (Section 8.5) 
Expense Agreement 
Pursuant to the expense agreement entered into by us under the restated trust agreement. we will irrevocably 
and unconditionally guarantee to each person or entity to whom the trust becomes indebted or liable, the full 
payment of any costs, expenses or liabilities of the trust, other than obligations of the trust to pay to the holders 
of the preferred securities or other similar interests in the trust of the amounts due such holders pursuant to the 
terms of the preferred securities or such other similar interests, as the case may be.
