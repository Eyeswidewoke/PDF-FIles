Americas Region Reputational Risk Committee Policy 
Section 1: Scope and Responsibility 
Deutsche Bank 
The Americas Region supports business practices that comply with the Group Reputational Risk 
Management Program, as outlined in the DB Group Reputational Risk Management Program Policy 
dated May 9, 2011, and also complies with the requirements of the Group "Conduct of Meetings" policy. 
Within the Americas region, consideration of all reputational risk issues is the responsibility of the 
Americas Regional Governance Board (RGB). The RGB has delegated such consideration to the 
Americas Reputational Risk Committee (ARRC), a permanent sub-committee of the RGB. 
The governance requirements described in this remit are applicable to all businesses, infrastructure 
groups and employees in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Cayman Islands. 
1.1 Mission 
The ARRC functions as the senior regional approval and oversight committee in the Americas for 
reputational risk. The ARRC is responsible for the development of a regional reputational risk appetite, 
setting standards for ARRC review, establishing criteria for escalation within and outside the region, and 
providing guidance to assist the Business Divisions in identifying reputational risk issues for escalation to 
the ARRC. The ARRC provides oversight of the regional reputational risk appetite. 
1.2 
Tasks and Responsibilities of the ARRC 
The ARRC is responsible for reviewing, assessing, and opining on all reputational risk issues brought to 
the ARRC by businesses or Control & Support functions. Resolution of an issue means that the 
Committee may approve, approve with conditions, defer or reject any proposal presented. 
The ARRC 
is also responsible for escalating issues that cannot or should not be decided within the region (see 
Section 8). The ARRC has a responsibility to report all actions taken within the region through the RRN 
(Reputational Risk Network) for further aggregation on a global level. Lastly, the ARRC sets and 
monitors the regional risk appetite for reputational risk. 
The ARRC escalates unresolved issues first to the RGB and then if necessary to the North America 
Executive Committee (ExCo) regionally, and to the Group Reputational Risk Committee globally. 
Within the Americas region, all transacting businesses and/or reviewing Control & Support functions, are 
required to bring to the ARRC for review any transactions that give rise to a new reputational risk or 
increase an existing risk. Reputational risk, as defined in Group Policy, is: 
"...The threat that publicity concerning a transaction, counterparty or business practice involving a 
client will negatively impact the public's trust in DB..." 
Such risk can be found when adopting a client, undertaking a transaction, pursuing a particular business 
activity or proposition, or even in associating DB's name with that of a particular client, company or 
industry. 
A Reputational Risk Analysis Desk Guide (Appendix 1) has been developed by Compliance and Legal 
to assist businesses and control functions in reviewing the reputational risk aspects of a transaction or 
other venture, so that the decision to escalate issues for a reputational risk review can be made in an 
informed manner. 
Appendix 2 contains the criteria the business should apply when identifying reputational risk issues to 
be escalated to the ARRC. The grid defines which transactions can be handled within the business, 
within the business but with reporting to the ARRC and escalated to the ARRC for pre-approval.
