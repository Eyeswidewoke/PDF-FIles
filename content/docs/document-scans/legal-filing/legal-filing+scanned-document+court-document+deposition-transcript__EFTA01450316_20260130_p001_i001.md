Important Disclosures for Your Records 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. "DBSI" is furnishing this document to you to alert you to important matters regarding your account. 
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (aSIPC"I 
Securities held by our clearing broker. Pershing LLC. for your account are protected up to the total net equity hold in the account. Of this total. SIPC 
provides 9500.000 of coverage. including $100,000 for claims for cash awaiting reinvestment. The remaining coverage is provided by Pershing 
through a commercial insurer. SIPC protection applies when the SIPC member firm through which you hold your investments fails financially and is 
unable to meet its obligations to securities clients, but SIPC protection does not protect against losses attributable to the rise and fall in the market 
value of investments. A smell number of client accounts are not carried on Pershing's books due to specific account factors. These accounts are 
covered under DBSI's SIPC membership. 0851 does not provide coverage in excess of SIPC coverage. Certain investments, such as commodity 
futures contracts and currency, are ineligible for SIPC protection. For additional information on SIPC, see www.SIPC.org or call the SIPC public 
information number, (202) 371-8300. 
Payment for Order Flow 
DBAB receives payment when its routes for execution certain orders in certain securities. The determination as to where to route orders is based on 
several factors, consistent with DBSI's obligation to provide best execution for all client orders. Because several factors are considered with respect 
to such determinations, DBSI could potentially secure price improvements on such orders by routing them in a different manner and all such orders 
potentially could be executed at prices superior to the best bid or best offer. Payment is received by DBSI in the form of rebates. or credits against 
exchange fees, and specialist fees. Details will be furnished upon written request.
