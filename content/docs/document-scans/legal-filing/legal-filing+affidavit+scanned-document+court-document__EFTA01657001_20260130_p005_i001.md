point in the interview (II). Consistent with the original CI, the interviewer should remain soft-spoken, 
respectful, and use pauses effectively to maintain the focus on the subject. Given that rapport has been 
developed and the interview has been conducted in an information-gathering style using "teamwork," the 
interviewer should ask the subject to "help me explain this?' The confrontation should be conducted in a 
"drip" (piece by piece) manner rather than in attempt to overwhelm the subject with all of the incriminat-
ing information at once (10). Research shows that the weakest evidence should be presented first. This 
procedure increases the likelihood for additional inconsistent statements because it does not allow for a 
comprehensive explanation from a liar at one time. 
In response to a more direct challenge ("Is everything you have told me been the truth? I think you 
have been lying to me this entire time."), research shows that most truthful subjects will give a firm denial 
and then offer additional information in support of their truthfulness (8). In contrast, liars tend to deflect 
an answer with responses such as, "I'm sorry you don't believe me" or "Why would I lie?" In sum, truth-
ful subjects tend to offer more information in response to a challenge whereas liars tend to offer little or 
no additional credible information. 
7. Review. The interview summary should be framed as in the CI for witnesses, as an opportunity for 
the subject to correct any inaccuracies and to recall additional facts. With suspects, the interviewer should 
change a non-incriminating element of the subject's story to see if the subject spontaneously corrects the 
inaccuracy (20). Liars tend not to correct the inaccuracy, but rather quickly agree with the review, includ-
ing the changed element of the story, in an attempt to end the interview as soon as possible. 
8. Closure. If the subject has appeared truthful, thank them for their cooperation. If the subject has 
appeared deceptive, express that you feel disappointed and disrespected (exploiting the rapport stage). In 
the latter case, it is worth an attempt to explain to the subject that it would be better for him/her to tell the 
truth now rather than later. 
The present experiment was designed to provide an initial evaluation of the first six stages of the CIS 
and to serve as a demonstration of the potential of the CIS for assessing deception. College student re-
search assistants, trained in the CIS protocol, interviewed fellow students about particular life events. For 
some of the interviews, the storyteller was truthful about the life event, whereas for other interviews the 
storyteller was deceptive, fabricating the entire story. The trained interviewers were asked to judge the 
truthfulness of each storyteller at six stages of the CIS protocol—rapport, narrative, drawing, follow-up 
questions, reverse-order recall, and challenge. With this methodology, it was possible to assess the cumu-
lative contributions of the stages of the CIS for assessing deception. The final two stages of the full CIS 
(review and closure) were not studied in this experiment.
