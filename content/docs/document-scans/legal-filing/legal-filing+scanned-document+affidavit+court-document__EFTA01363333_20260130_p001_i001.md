2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93633, * 
IHN25) A party may file a motion asking the court to reconsider its order or decision. 
A motion to reconsider shall be 
based on: 
1. Intervening change in controlling law; 
2. Availability of new evidence, or; 
3. The need to correct clear error or prevent manifest injustice 
LRCi 7.3 (2008). [" 26] 
[HN26] The purpose of a motion for reconsideration "is to correct manifest errors of law or 
fact or to present newly discovered evidence." Harsco Corp. v. Zlotnicki, 779 F.2d 906, 
909 (3d Cir. 1985). Such motions are not substitutes for appeals, and are not to be used 
as "a vehicle for registering disagreement with the courts initial decision, for rearguing 
matters already addressed by the court, or for raising arguments that could have been 
raised before but were not." Bostic v. AT&T of the V.I., 312 F.Supp. 2d 731, 733, 45 V.I. 
553 (D.V.I. 2004). 
In its motion for reconsideration, North Shore made two arguments. First, it argued that the 
bankruptcy court should reconsider because it improperly failed to consider Dawn 
Prosser's affidavit in deciding Carroll's motion for summary judgment. That argument is 
unsupported by the record. This Court has herein cited to numerous references in the 
bankruptcy court's memorandum opinion where it refers to and analyzes the substance of 
Dawn Prosser's affidavit. As such, the bankruptcy court did not err in refusing to reconsider 
on that basis. 
Second, North Shore argued that the court should grant its motion because the underlying 
complaint contains "factually r 27] untrue" allegations. (North Shore Mot. Recons. 6-7, 
Adv. Pro. No. 08-03048, ECF No. 36). That argument ignores the numerous opportunities 
which North Shore had to oppose Carroll's factual assertions. 
Carroll served North Shore with various requests for discovery, including requests for 
admissions. North Shore failed to adequately respond to such requests. Thereafter, Carroll 
filed two motions for summary judgment. North Shore had the opportunity to file 
oppositions to each of those motions. Although North Shore was tardy in filing such 
oppositions, the bankruptcy court nonetheless considered them in its memorandum 
opinion. Finally, the bankruptcy court held a hearing on Carroll's second motion for 
summary judgment. North Shore had the opportunity to challenge any of Carroll's factual 
assertions and to submit any evidence in support of its challenges at that hearing. North 
Shore failed to submit sufficient evidence supporting its assertions at that time. 
[HN27] "A motion for reconsideration cannot be used to relitigate old matters, raise 
argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment." 
See Dunkley v. Mellon Investor Servs., 378 Fed. Appx. 169, 172 (3rd Cir. 2010)(internal 
['28] citation omitted). Yet, that is precisely what North Shore has done. Indeed, the 
information that North Shore presents was available to it at the time when it filed its 
opposition to Carroll's motion for summary judgment. In an effort to relitigate this matter, 
North Shore now seeks to rehash procedurally admitted factual issues. That effort is not
