FX Blueprint Dashing Buck 
Theme In: Japanese Takeaway 
We expect sensitivity to the JPY and offshore 
portfolio allocation preferences will continue to 
drive Asian FX. We are long USD/KRVV, USD/SGD 
& MYR/JPY. 
Asian FX returns this year have largely been driven by 
varying sensitivities to the JPY. Correlations to the JPY 
(first chart) differentiate the relative laggards - that 
compete for exports and portfolio flows with Japan -
from the relative leaders - that are integrated into 
Japanese supply chains and should benefit from 
Japanese import demand, FDI, and potential QE-
induced portfolio investment. With USD/JPY breaking 
into the triple-digit atmosphere, and a bulk of the "real" 
flow impact from Japanese policies yet to materialize, 
these divergent correlations remain the best guide to 
regional FX trends. in our view. In addition to the JPY, 
the outperformance of EM debt over EM equity fund 
flows has boosted debt-centric ASEAN FX over equity-
centric North Asian FX. We believe this trend has legs 
but will become more selective. 
KR1.1V has the most to lose from JP? weakness. 
Competitiveness metrics such as export similarity 
indices point to a trade channel vulnerability. But the 
real pressure point comes from the portfolio channel. 
Earnings 
expectation 
downgrades 
for 
Korean 
companies and upgrades in Japan are driving relative 
equity market performance, resulting in flows into 
Japan and away from Korea. Importantly, an identical 
trend unfolded during the JPY weakness of 2004.07 
(second chart). Politicization of FX may also drive 
further monetary easing and FX intervention in Korea. 
By comparison, TVVD losses should be more subdued 
from here given weaker export competition with Japan, 
stronger equity inflows and central bank USD supply. 
SEA) is the Ftuntst USD WU, in Asia. By virtue of its 
NEER framework, the USD IVO has consistently been 
the top driver of USD/SGD. Unsurprisingly then, the 
importance of the JPY to SGD has surged since the 
USD/JPY uptrend began in October. Importantly, a long 
USD/SGD view is predicated in principal on USD 
strength 
broadening 
across 
Singapore's 
trading 
partners. It is thus even compatible with SSNEER 
tracking near the top band, although this positioning 
makes the risk-reward that much more attractive. 
MYR should ou?phrform, given good inflow potential 
and a growing trade surplus with Japan. The status 
quo election result should sponsor portfolio rebalancing 
towards Malaysia. Equities have considerable scope to 
catch up to ASEAN peers, where valuations are now 
unattractive. IPOs should resume in force and could 
attract offshore interest. Bond allocations should pick 
up as underweights are covered (third chart) and as 
Thailand considers penalizing bond market access for 
foreigners. Malaysia meanwhile is unlikely to consider 
capital controls or a line in the sand on FX.
