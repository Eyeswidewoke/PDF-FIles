The crucial scientific question for policy isn't whether the climate is changing. That is a settled matter: The climate has 
always changed and always will. Geological and historical records show the occurrence of major climate shifts, 
sometimes over only a few decades. We know, for instance, that during the 20th century the Earth's global average 
surface temperature rose 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Nor is the crucial question whether humans are influencing the climate. That is no hoax: There is little doubt in the 
scientific community that continually growing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, due largely to carbon-
dioxide emissions from the conventional use of fossil fuels, are influencing the climate. There is also little doubt that the 
carbon dioxide will persist in the atmosphere for several centuries. The impact today of human activity appears to be 
comparable to the intrinsic, natural variability of the climate system itself. 
Rather, the crucial, unsettled scientific question for policy is, "How will the climate change over the next century under 
both natural and human influences?" Answers to that question at the global and regional levels, as well as to equally 
complex questions of how ecosystems and human activities will be affected, should inform our choices about energy 
and infrastructure. 
But—here's the catch—those questions are the hardest ones to answer. They challenge, in a fundamental way, what 
science can tell us about future climates. 
Even though human influences could have serious consequences for the climate, they are physically small in relation to 
the climate system as a whole. For example, human additions to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by the middle of the 
21st century are expected to directly shift the atmosphere's natural greenhouse effect by only 1% to 2%. Since the 
climate system is highly variable on its own, that smallness sets a very high bar for confidently projecting the 
consequences of human influences. 
A second challenge to "knowing" future climate is today's poor understanding of the oceans. The oceans, which change 
over decades and centuries, hold most of the climate's heat and strongly influence the atmosphere. Unfortunately, 
precise, comprehensive observations of the oceans are available only for the past few decades; the reliable record is still 
far too short to adequately understand how the oceans will change and how that will affect climate. 
A third fundamental challenge arises from feedbacks that can dramatically amplify or mute the climate's response to 
human and natural influences. One important feedback, which is thought to approximately double the direct heating 
effect of carbon dioxide, involves water vapor, clouds and temperature.

But feedbacks are uncertain. They depend on the details of processes such as evaporation and the flow of radiation 
through clouds. They cannot be determined confidently from the basic laws of physics and chemistry, so they must be 
verified by precise, detailed observations that are, in many cases, not yet available. 
Beyond these observational challenges are those posed by the complex computer models used to project future climate. 
These massive programs attempt to describe the dynamics and interactions of the various components of the Earth 
system—the atmosphere, the oceans, the land, the ice and the biosphere of living things. While some parts of the 
models rely on well-tested physical laws, other parts involve technically informed estimation. Computer modeling of 
complex systems is as much an art as a science. 
For instance, global climate models describe the Earth on a grid that is currently limited by computer capabilities to a 
resolution of no finer than 60 miles. (The distance from New York City to Washington, D.C., is thus covered by only four
