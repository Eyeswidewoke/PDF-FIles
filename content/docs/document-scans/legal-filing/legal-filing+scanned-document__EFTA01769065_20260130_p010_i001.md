The planned weapons system is "not suitable f=r the use of missiles equipped with nuclear warheads. The submarines 
are t=erefore not being constructed and equipped for launching nuclear weapons,&=uot; reads a classified document 
from Finance Ministry State Secretary Karl Diller to the Bundestag budget committee dat=d Aug. 29, 2006. 
In other words, the=government was saying that Germany delivered a conventional submarine -- w=at the Israelis did 
with it afterwards was their own business. In 1999, th= then State Secretary Brigitte Schulte wrote that the German 
government could not "rule out any armament for=which the operating navy has capability, following the appropriate 
retrofi=ting." 
THE WAR OVER THE BO=B: THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND IRAN 
The conflict betwee= Israel and Iran has intensified steadily since 2006. War is a real danger= For months now, Israel has 
been preparing governments around the world, a= well as the international public, for a bombing of the nuclear facilities 
at Natanz, Fordu and Isfahan using=cutting-edge conventional, bunker-busting weapons. Prime Minister 
Benjamin=Netanyahu and his Defense Minister Ehud Barak are convinced that the "=window" is closing in which such an 
attack would be effective, as Iran is in the process of moving most of its=nuclear enrichment activities deep below 
ground. 
In his recent contr=versial poem "What Must Be Said," ainter Grass describes the s=bmarines, "whose speciality 
consists in (their) ability / to direct n=clear warheads toward / an area in which not a single atom bomb / has yet been 
proved to exist," as the potentially decisiv= step towards a nuclear disaster in the Iran conflict. The poem met with 
i=ternational protests. Comparing Israel and Iran was "not brilliant, b=t absurd," said German Foreign Minister Guido 
Westerwelle. Netanyahu spoke of an "absolute scandal" and his in=erior minister banned Grass from entering Israel. 
But some people agr=ed with the author. Gansel, the SPD politician, says that Grass has trigge=ed an important debate, 
because Netanyahu's "ranting about preventive=war" touches on a difficult aspect of international law. In reality, it is 
unlikely that Israel will use the submarines in a w=r with Iran as long as Tehran does not have nuclear missiles -- even 
thoug= the Israeli government has considered using the "Samson" option=on at least two occasions in the past. 
The country's milit=ry situation following the Egyptian and Syrian surprise attack during the =973 Yom Kippur holiday 
was so desperate that Prime Minister Golda Meir 
=s intelligence service reports have now revealed -- ordered her 
Defense Minister Moshe Dayan to prepare severa= nuclear bombs for combat and deliver them to air force units. Then, 
just =efore the warheads were to be armed, the tide turned. Israel's forces gain=d the upper hand on the battlefield, and 
the bombs made their way back to their underground bunkers. 
Unwillingness to Co=promise 
And in the first ho=rs of the 1991 Gulf War, an American satellite registered that Israel had =esponded to the 
bombardment by Iraqi Scud missiles by mobilizing its nucle=r force. Israeli analysts had mistakenly assumed that the 
Scuds would be armed with poison gas. It remains unclear =ow Israel would have acted if a Scud missile tipped with 
nerve gas had hit=a residential area. 
Only Netanyahu and =ran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, probably know how close the =orld stands today to 
a new war. The Israeli prime minister and Khamenei ha=e "one thing in common," says Walther StUtzle, a former state 
secretary in Germany's Federal Defense Ministry:="They enjoy conflict. If Israel attacks, Iran slips out of the aggres=or 
role and into that of victim." The UN won't provide the mandate th=t would legitimize such an attack, which means 
Israel would be breaking the law, argues StUtzle, who is now at the Germ=n Institute for International and Security 
Affairs (SWP), a Berlin-based t=ink tank. "True friendship," he believes, "requires the Ger=an chancellor to stay 
Netanyahu's arm and prevent him from resorting to an armed attack. Germany's obligation to protect Isr=el includes 
protecting the country from embarking on suicidal adventures.&=uot;
