3. It's not dependent on an individual's health or 
death. The fees associated with a PPVA don't depend 
on the health of the individuaL There's no mortality 
component of a PPVA. There are no medical exams 
required and no underwriting. 
PPVA Limitations 
As discussed more fully below, while a client may allo-
cate to any of the IDFs offered on the company's PPVA 
investment account platform, the client can't control the 
selection of securities within the IDFs. 
If distributions are taken from the PPVA investment 
account before age .59%, there's a 10 percent penalty 
in addition to income tax on the gain element of the 
distribution. 
All gains accrued within the PPVA investment 
account are ultimately subject to the potentially higher 
ordinary income tax rates (unless distrib-
uted to charity). 
And, any balance remaining in the PPVA 
investment account owned on the client's 
date of death is subject to both income and 
estate tax (unless left to charity). 
So, when could it make sense to consider 
using PPVA? 
Enhance Tax Efficiency 
Clients with exposure to traditionally tax-
inefficient asset classes (for example, hedge 
funds, high-yield bonds and growth-orient-
ed equities) could benefit from using PPVA. 
It's important, however, not to let the tax 
"tail" wag the investment "dog." Typically, 
only if a top performing manager is available 
on the PPVA investment account platform 
could this make sense. 
More broadly, though, clients with a typi-
cal multi-asset class portfolio in a higher 
income tax regime could also benefit from 
a PPVA. 
A PPVA works in either case for the same 
reasons that retail investors have for years 
benefitted from investing in their individual 
retirement accounts Income tax deferral 
almost always makes sense. 
"After-Tax Advantage," this page, illustrates the ben-
efit of owning a higher income tax portfolio in a PPVA 
investment account. After about five years, the PPVA 
account outperforms the taxable account. 
Practice lip: While the client owns the PPVA 
investment account and can choose to allocate to 
any of the IDFs offered by the insurance company on 
its PPVA investment account platform, the IDFs are 
deemed to be owned by the insurance company's sepa-
rate account. Therefore, investors in vehicles like hedge 
funds would like the fact that the K-Is are delivered to 
the insurance company, not to the PPVA investment 
account owner. 
Charitable Legacy P anning 
Extremely wealthy individuals who plan on making a 
substantial gift to charity at death have also awakened
