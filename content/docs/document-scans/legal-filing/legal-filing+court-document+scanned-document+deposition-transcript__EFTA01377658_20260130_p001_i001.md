management and entail various expenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. In addition, we have limited 
experience in acquiring other businesses. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired 
personnel, operations, and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We 
also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses due to a number of factors, including difficulties 
resulting from the integration of technologies, IT systems, accounting systems, culture or personnel; diversion of management's 
attention; litigation; use of resources; or other disruption of our operations. Regulatory constraints, particularly competition 
regulations. may also affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of our acquisitions or investments. Acquisitions could 
also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt. In addition, we may spend time and money on 
acquisitions or investments that do not increase our revenue. If an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business 
may be materially and adversely affected. 
Our reported financial results may be materially and adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States. 
Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret 
appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported 
financial results and could materially and adversely affect the transactions completed before the announcement of a change. 
We may have exposure to greater-than-anticipated tax liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business. 
We are subject to income taxes and non-income taxes in the United States and other countries in which we conduct 
business. and such laws and rates vary by jurisdiction. We are subject to review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign 
tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take and if any such tax authority were to successfully 
challenge any such position, our financial results and operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our future 
tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, rates, and regulations. The determination of our worldwide provision 
for income and other taxes is highly complex and requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations 
where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the amount ultimately payable 
may differ from amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods 
for which such determination is made. 
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock and this Offering 
The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control within our existing 
stockholders, including our employees and directors and their affiliates; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence 
corporate matters. 
Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock, which is the stock we are offering in 
our initial public offering, has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, including our executive 
officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, will together hold approximately 99.1% of the voting power of our outstanding 
capital stock following our initial public offering. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common 
stock, the holders of our Class B cornmon stock collectively will hold more than a majority of the combined voting power of our 
common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering, and

therefore such holders will be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. When the shares of our Class 
B common stock represent less than 5% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock,
