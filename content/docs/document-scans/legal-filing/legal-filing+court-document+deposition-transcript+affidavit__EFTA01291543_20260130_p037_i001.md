have been obtained from independent vendor services, vAtich we believe to be reliable. Market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ from the actual sale price. Securities for which a price is 
riot avagable are marked "N/A" and are omitted from the Total.

sometimes unable to provide timely information. Where pricing sources are not readily available, estimated prices may be used. When the updated price is received from the price provider, the updated pnce will 
be used in the release of the current month's statement. Prior statements will not be revised. You should always request a current valuation for your securities prior to making a financial decision or placing an 
order. 
Deutsche Bank proprietary investments and miscellaneous assets held by Disuetionary Accounts, Trust Accounts and Custody Accounts include several categories of securities. Miscellaneous foreign assets

fisted. If the last price available for such securities is unchanged for a period of time deemed appropriate for that asset, the current price vii purge and NIA will be placed in the price field in the statement. The 
pricing of listed options takes into account the last closing price, as wet as the current bid and offer prices.

quantities. interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant. A capital gain or retum of principal may be included n the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to 
worpershingoorn/business_continuity.html for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received.
