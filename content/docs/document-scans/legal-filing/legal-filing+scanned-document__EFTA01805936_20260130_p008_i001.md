September 26, 2013 -- "The world is more stable than it was five years ago," Barack Obama assured the U.N. General 
Assembly on Tuesday. This transparently self-serving but otherwise baffling claim came at the beginning of a long and 
dense address chttp://www.whitehouse.govithe-press-office/2013/09/24/remarks-president-obama-address-united-
nations-general-assembly> aimed at answering the critique that he lacks a coherent foreign policy, particularly 
regarding the Middle East. 
Judging from the widely varying <http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ej-dionne-obamas-diplomatic-outreach--
to-americans/2013/09/25/c8498ce6.2615.11e3-ad0d-b7c8d2a594b9_story.html> reactions he inspired 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trouble-at-the-core-of-us-foreign-policy/2013/09/25/b7d2652a-2608-
11e3-b7Sd-5b7f66349852_story.html> , Obama didn't end the confusion about what he stands for. But his boast that his 
presidency has calmed the globe opened a window on his peculiar outlook on foreign affairs — and why it has led him to 
mismanage the most important crises on his watch. 
So: Why, according to Obama, is the world better off than in 2008? Well, the global economic crisis has abated. But 
that's not all: "We've also worked to end a decade of war," the president said, by withdrawing U.S. and NATO troops 
from Iraq and Afghanistan and "shifting away from a perpetual war footing." Here's where you could almost hear the 
head-scratching in the Iraqi and Afghan delegations: Violence in both of those countries 
chttp://www.longwarjournalorg/threat-matrix/archives/2013/07/taliban_step_up_operations_in.php> is considerably 
worse than it was five years ago, in part because of the U.S. withdrawals. 
Also, as Obama half-acknowledged, al-Qaeda is more of a threat in more places — Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, Libya, Syria 
<http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/timeline-unrest-in-syria/207/> — than it was in 2008. And then there 
is the region stretching from Morocco to Iran, which is experiencing not stability but an epochal upheaval, one that has 
brought civil war or anarchy to a half-dozen countries and spawned the greatest crimes against humanity since the turn 
of the 21st century. 
It's easy to dismiss Obama's claim on factual grounds. More interesting is to see what prompted it: a soda-straw view of 
the world in which only the president's inauguration-day priorities are visible. His aim then was to bring home U.S. 
troops, end the "endless war" of George W. Bush, defend the homeland from al-Qaeda and step back from the quagmire 
of the Arab Middle East. He did all that; ergo, the world is more stable — and from the attenuated perspective of an 
American who mainly wishes the world would go away, perhaps it is. 
This definition of stability, however, requires ignoring all that would disturb it — anything that might demand new 
military commitments or deeper U.S. engagement with Arabs and their seemingly endless conflicts. And so Obama 
spelled out four "core interests" for which he would use "all elements of our power, including military force": preventing 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, stopping attacks on the U.S. homeland, defending allies and ensuring 
the "free flow of energy." All else, including promoting democracy and preventing genocide, was relegated to a lesser 
category, in which his administration will act only in concert with "the international community." And maybe not even 
then. 
It's worth noting that Obama has not always been so small-minded, at least rhetorically. In May 2011, after the NATO 
intervention in Libya that he reluctantly joined, he delivered another major address <http://www.whitehouse.govithe-
press-office/2011/05/19/remarks-president-middle-east-and-north-africa> on the Middle East. He started by listing the 
same core priorities. Then he said: "We must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow pursuit of these 
interests will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind."
