Dear Jeffrey 
Further to your conversations with Julian I would like to summarise the information previously sent 
on our company background as well as add more concise detail and explanation. 
Our business model is to acquire distressed/foreclosed property in Michigan. The market segment 
we target is that of properties valued between $45,000 and $65,000. This segment returns the 
highest net rental yields and also has the largest capital appreciation prospect in proportion to value. 
Once properties are rehabbed and tenanted they are sold to investors at a profit. Typically our profit 
margin ranges between 25-30% per property sold. The process and profit can be illustrated in the 
following typical example of our modus operandi: 
1. RTI Team in Michigan sources properties 
2. RTI Directors screen the properties and purchases are made 
3. RTI Team in Michigan rehabs the properties, places tenants 
4. RTI sells properties to investors as turnkey, cash flowing properties, with full property 
management in place and a 2 year rental guarantee of 12%. 
To illustrate our profit again, I have quantified the above steps based on our averages. 
(2) Our average cost of acquisition is $36,000 
(3) Our average cost for rehab is $9,000 
(4) Our average sale price to investor is $62,000 
Total cost of producing a turnkey property is $45,000; which against a sale price of $62,000 equates 
to a profit margin of 27% or ROI of 38%. 
A few notes on the above: 
• 
We do not currently purchase properties in the City of Detroit, but rather in the neighbouring 
suburban cities (e.g. Royal Oak, Redford, Southfield, Oak Park and Eastpointe). 
• 
We continue to monitor the desirable residential areas of Detroit City and if, as we foresee, 
property taxes decrease in the city we will be open to purchasing units there. 
• 
The whole cycle of buying a portfolio of properties, rehabbing, tenanting and selling to an 
investor takes between 8 and 12weeks. 
• 
Properties we purchase are about a third of the prices of what they were at Peak Prices in 
2005/2006 
• 
Properties we purchase are about 50% of the cost to rebuild 
• 
Property Management is carried out by an external company with whom we have a mutually 
exclusive agreement. i.e. they only manage our properties. This ensures they are as dependant 
on us as we are on them 
• 
Tenant demand is extremely buoyant in the areas we invest in. On average we normally have 3 
to 5 tenant application per property during the rehab stage and we always have a tenant in 
place before the rehab is finished 
• 
Our collection rate for 2012 was circa 95% which is why we felt comfortable introducing the 12% 
net rental guarantee 
• 
ALL our clients/investors to date are fully satisfied with the purchases they have bought and are 
enjoying the returns we have quoted them with. References available upon request.
