the premium received, and gives up the opportunity for gain on the underlying security below the 
exercise price of the option. If the seller of the put option owns a put option covering an 
equivalent number of shares with an exercise price equal to or greater than the exercise price of 
the put written, the position is "fully hedged" if the option owned expires at the same time or 
later than the option written. The seller of an uncovered put option assumes the risk of a decline 
in the market price of the underlying security below the exercise price of the option. The buyer 
of a put option assumes the risk of losing its entire investment in the put option. 
Forward Trading. Forward contracts (including foreign exchange) and options thereon 
are not traded on exchanges and are not standardized; rather banks and dealers act as principals 
in these markets, negotiating each transaction on a an individual basis. Forward and "cash" 
trading is substantially unregulated -- there is no limitation on daily price movements and 
speculative position limits are not applicable. The principals who deal in the forward markets 
are not required to continue to make markets in the currencies or commodities they trade and 
these markets can experience periods of illiquidity, sometimes of significant duration, which 
could result in substantial losses to the Partnership. 
Futures Trading. 
Futures trading is very speculative, largely due to the traditional 
volatility of futures prices. Futures prices are affected by and may respond rapidly to a variety of 
factors, including (but not limited to) market and news reports, interest rates, national and 
international political or economic events, and domestic or foreign trade, monetary or fiscal 
policies or programs. Such rapid response might include an opening price on an affected futures 
contract sharply higher or lower than the previous day's close. In such an instance, the 
Partnership might be unable to adjust its positions in time to avoid a loss. 
Commodity futures prices are highly volatile. Price movements of futures contracts are 
influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand relationships, domestic and 
foreign governmental programs and policies, and national and international political and 
economic events. 
Moreover, commodity exchanges limit fluctuations in commodity figures contract prices 
during a single day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." 
During a single trading day no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the 
price of a futures contract for a particular commodity has increased or decreased by an amount 
equal to the daily limit, positions in the commodity can be neither taken nor liquidated unless 
traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Commodity futures prices have 
occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Similar 
occurrences could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and 
subject the Partnership to substantial losses. 
Options on Futures. Trading options on futures involves a high degree of risk. The risks 
of trading options on futures are similar to the risks of trading securities options, but often 
involve even greater leverage and risks. In addition, if the purchaser of an option on a futures 
contract exercises the option, the holder will, in effect, be buying or selling the underlying 
futures contract, and will then be subject to the same risks as are attendant to futures trading.
