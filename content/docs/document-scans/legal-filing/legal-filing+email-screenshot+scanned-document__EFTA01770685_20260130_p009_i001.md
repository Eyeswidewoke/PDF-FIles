Establishing these =ones would require nations like Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan to =rm the opposition 
soldiers with anti-tank, countersniper and portable anti=ircraft weapons. Special forces from countries like Qatar, Turkey 
and possibly Britain and France could offer t=ctical and strategic advice to the Free Syrian Army forces. Sending them i= 
is logistically and politically feasible; some may be there already. Cruc=ally, these special forces would control the flow of 
intelligence regarding the government's troop moveme=ts and lines of communication to allow opposition troops to 
cordon off pop=lation centers and rid them of snipers. Once Syrian government forces were=killed, captured or allowed 
to defect without reprisal, attention would turn to defending and expanding the no-k=ll zones. 
This next step woul= require intelligence focused on tank and aircraft movements, the placemen= of artillery batteries 
and communications lines among Syrian government f=rces. The goal would be to weaken and isolate government units 
charged with attacking particular towns; this wou=d allow opposition forces to negotiate directly with army officers on 
truc=s within each zone, which could then expand into a regional, and ultimatel= national, truce. The key condition for 
all such assistance, inside or outside Syria, is that it be used defen=ively — only to stop attacks by the Syrian military or 
to clear out gove=nment forces that dare to attack the no-kill zones. Although keeping inter=ention limited is always 
hard, international assistance could be curtailed if the Free Syrian Army took the offensive. =he absolute priority within 
no-kill zones would be public safety and human=tarian aid; revenge attacks would not be tolerated. 
Syria's president= B=shar al-Assad 
thttp://topics.nytimes.comitopireferenceitimestopics/peo=le/a/bashar_al_assad/index.html?inline=nyt-per> , is 
increasingly depe=ding on government-sponsored gangs and on shelling cities with heavy artil=ery rather than 
overrunning them with troops, precisely because he is conc=rned about the loyalty of soldiers forced to shoot their 
fellow citizens at point-blank range. If government =roops entered no-kill zones they would have to face their former 
comrades.=Placing them in this situation, and presenting the option to defect, would=show just how many members of 
Syria's army — estimated at 300,000 men — were actually willing to fight for M=. Assad. 
Turkey and the Arab=League should also help opposition forces inside Syria more actively throu=h the use of remotely 
piloted helicopters, either for delivery of cargo an= weapons — as America has used them in Afghanistan — or to attack 
Syrian air defenses and mortars in order t= protect the no-kill zones. Turkey is rightfully cautious about depl=ying its 
ground forces, an act that Mr. Assad could use as grounds to decl=re war and retaliate. But Turkey has some of its own 
drones, and Arab League countries could quickly lease others. A= in Libya, the international community should not act 
without the approval=and the invitation of the countries in the region that are most directly a=fected by Mr. Assad's war 
on his own people. Thus it is up to the Arab League and Turkey to adopt a plan of=action. If Russia and China were 
willing to abstain rather than exercise a=other massacre-enabling veto, then the Arab League could go back to the 
Un=ted Nations Security Council for approval. If not, then Turkey and the Arab League should act, on their 
own=authority and that of the other 13 members of the Security Council and 137=members of the General Assembly 
who voted last week to condemn Mr. Assad=92s brutality. The power of the Syrian protesters over the past 11 months 
has arisen from their determination to =ace down bullets with chants, signs and their own bodies. The internationa= 
community can draw on the power of nonviolence and create zones of peace =n what are now zones of death. The 
Syrians have the ability to make that happen; the rest of the world mu=t give them the means to do it.
