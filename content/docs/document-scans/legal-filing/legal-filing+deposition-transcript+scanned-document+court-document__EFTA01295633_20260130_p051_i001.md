785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
54(b). "[C]ertifications are not frozen once made," Amgen, Inc., 133 S. Ct. at 1202 n.9, and 
a district court has "considerable discretion to decertify the class," Cent. Wesleyan Coll. v. 
W.R. Grace & Co., 6 F.3d 177, 189 (4th Cir. 1993). See also PradoSteiman ex rel. Prado 
v. Bush, 221 F.3d 1266, 1273 (11th Cir. 2000). The district court could revisit its 
interlocutory decision regardless r821 of whether, as the majority puts it, "new facts or 
legal precedent [arose] after Brown I." Maj. op. at 59. 
In effect, the majority today certifies a Rule 23(b)(3) class action without any court ever 
finding that the Rule 23(b)(3) requirements are satisfied. It cannot genuinely contend that 
Brown I did the work, ['928] as "the Fourth Circuit has never allowed the rigorous Rule 23 
analysis to be accomplished implicitly." Partington v. Am. Intl Specialty Lines Ins. Co., 443 
F.3d 334, 341 (4th Cir. 2006). And the district court ultimately did not make such a finding 
either. The majority's decision to certify in part on this illusory mandate, then, substantially 
damages Rule 23(b)(3)'s "vital prescription." Amchem, 521 U.S. at 623. The Supreme 
Court recently reminded us that "plaintiffs wishing to proceed through a class action must 
actually prove -- not simply plead -- that their proposed class satisfies each requirement of 
Rule 23, including . . . the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3)." Halliburton Co. v. 
Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2398, 2412, 189 L. Ed. 2d 339 (2014). At least as to 
predominance, Plaintiffs have yet to prove anything. 
Plaintiffs did not challenge the district court's predominance ruling and do not credibly 
explain why they failed to do so. The district court's decision should therefore be affirmed 
on that basis alone. 
II. Relevant Standards 
Even ignoring Plaintiffs' waiver of the predominance issue, they have not r831 
established that the district court abused its discretion in finding insufficient commonality. 
To see why, it is first necessary to recognize the standard that appellate courts use in 
reviewing a district court's class-certification decision. Then, the standard that the district 
court used in evaluating the evidence at the certification stage must be considered. 
A. 
1. 
A district court's ultimate class-certification decision — that is, how it applied the Rule 23 
factors -- is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., EQT Prod. Co., 764 F.3d at 
357; Ward, 595 F.3d at 179; Monroe v. City of Charlottesville, Va., 579 F.3d 380, 384 (4th 
Cir. 2009); Gregory v. Finova Capital Corp., 442 F.3d 188, 190 (4th Cir. 2006). But reciting 
the standard is not enough; there must be genuine respect and adherence paid to the 
limits that it imposes. 
The abuse-of-discretion standard does establish some substantial limits, representing "one 
of the most deferential standards of review." Matthew Bender & Co. v. West Publ'g Co., 
240 F.3d 116, 121 (2d Cir. 2001). Under it, the appellate court may reverse only when "the 
[trial] court's exercise of discretion, considering the law and the facts, was arbitrary and
