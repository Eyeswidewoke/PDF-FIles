Early in his career, as head of t=e Press and Publications Department, his priority was 
not placed on topics related to th= oil industry or politics, but on the gaining and sharing of knowledge, information and 
good values among all Arab youth and not only Kuwaiti nationals. He launched "Al-Arabi" monthly magazine in the late 
1950s to become the most widely read publication in the Arabic language, focusing on culture, literature, science, as 
well as topical issues in the region and around the world, with an overtone of tolerance, openness, understanding 
and=respect. The magazine, which is still in circulation today, aims to instil g=od values of faith and culture in Arab youth 
while encouraging their pursuit of=knowledge, and at the same time serves to deliver to the world a message of 
tolerance and true Arab cultural values. 
As Kuwait gained its independenc=, Sheikh Sabah was appointed Foreign Minister to 
oversee Kuwait becoming a member of the world family at the United Nations. Since that ceremony the UN gained a 
trusted friend and supporter in Sheikh Sabah, whose well-balanced diplomacy made himrone of the longest serving 
foreign ministers in the world — more tha= 40 years of service — and gained him the title as the Dean of World 
Diplomacy. 
As Foreign Minister, he also hea=ed the Standing Committee of Gulf Aid, which under 
his tenure saw humanitarian support for Yemen and Southern Sudan increased. 
Over his long years of service, S=eikh Sabah led or contributed to diplomatic efforts 
aimed at reconciling differences and promoting peace among world nations. His personal mediation for peace in 
the=region led to a peace treaty that ended hostilities between North Yemen and South Yemen in 1972, and another 
treaty to end a conflict between Oman and Y=men in 1984. Sheikh Sabah was also instrumental in several mediation and 
reconci=iation efforts, including the Taif Agreement to end the civil war in Lebanon. 
Additionally, Kuwait recently ho=ted peace talks between Yemen's warring parties, and 
it remains committed to any efforts to a=d the war and bring peace and reconciliation. 
However, one ominous crisis with=potentially disastrous global repercussions may have 
been averted with mediation efforts made by Sheikh Sabah to avert escalation in the region. The on-going Qatari crisis 
h=s pitted a Qatari, Iranian, Turkish camp against a Saudi, Gulf, Egyptian camp,=in a region that supplies most of the 
world's oil and gas. The world wa= aware of the magnitude of the threat, and Sheikh Sabah's unrelenting efforts t= 
diffuse the tension drew unprecedented support from the UN, world community and the superpowers. Instead of 
looking after his own wellbeing at his advanced age,=well into his 80s, or enjoying a round of golf as his peers do, he 
again pro=ed his selflessness and took the initiative, shuttling tirelessly between the various capitals, and succeeded in 
stemming further escalation, despite the d=fficulties of abstaining from food and water from dawn to dusk during the 
holy fasting month of Ramadan. 
Today, he continues with his intense diplomatic efforts, with the same determination, 
t= bring all parties to the negotiating table, with full backing from the world community.
