Talking with Judge Jeannine Pint about Liars, Liberals and Leakers The Queens Gazette 
(New York) September 5, 2018 
years before by that same name to the millions of viewers who had watched her appear as 
a legal and political commentator on every major television network - reminds her readers. 
The story goes back to 1975 and occurred in the state of Arkansas. A beast named Alfred 
Taylor had been charged with the rape of a twelve- year old girl. The attack was so 
savage that it left the victim, now a 55 year- old woman, in a coma for several days and 
damaged her body so severely that she would be unable to have children for the rest of 
her life. 
The then 27 year old Clinton had not volunteered to represent Taylor but, rather, was 
assigned by a judge to serve as his court- appointed defense attorney. So, the fact that 
she employed a legal technicality to beat the rape charge against Taylor and then 
bargained with the prosecutor for him to plead guilty to a reduced charge, for which he was 
to serve less than one year in jail, would, arguably, have been unfair to hold against her. 
But the story of Clinton, the rapist and the 12 year- old victim does not end there. 
Recalling how she was able to successfully defend a man she knew to be guilty of such a 
heinous crime Clinton can be heard boasting in a recorded interview that surfaced in the 
mid- 1980's, "This guy accused of raping a 12 year -old girl. Course he claimed he didn't 
do it and all that stuff... I had him take a polygraph, which he passed- which forever 
destroyed my faith in polygraphs." 
The recording also revealed the sordid sense of humor of Clinton, who was captured 
laughing as she recalled that her defense of Taylor was aided by the Arkansas crime lab, 
which had accidentally destroyed DNA evidence tying him to the attack. 
In a fast paced, 20 - minute telephone interview I recently conducted with Pirro- also a 
former Westchester County judge and prosecutor- explained why she felt this horrible 
incident, though decades old, remained sufficiently relevant to be referred to in her book. 
'This woman {Hillary Clinton} who can be heard laughing about how she played the 
system to successfully defend a man she knew to be guilty of raping a 12 year- old girl 
actually has the gall to portray herself as a champion of women to this day", Pirro stated. " 
She used this sickening lie to get elected to the position of a United States Senator 
{elected 2000; re- elected 2006} , and, had it not been for Donald Trump, she would have 
used it to be elected President. 
"And what never stops sickening me", Pirro continued, " is that rather than disappear into 
the woods behind her home in Chappaqua{ New York}. after losing in 2016, she makes 
speeches and appears on television presenting herself as the high princess of women 
while accusing Donald Trump of being some sort of misogynist." 
I could detect, even over the telephone, the increasing passion in her voice, as she 
defended Trump, whom, as she writes in the book, has been her friend for more than 20 
years. "The President Trump that Hillary has the gall to try to portray as anti- woman is the 
same President Trump whose economic policies have created the most number of jobs for 
women in the history of our nation", she stated. "It is also the same President Trump who 
has appointed scores of women to some of highest positions in his administration, 
including Gina Haspel as the first female director of the CIA, Nikki Haley as the United 
States Ambassador to the UN, Kellyanne Conway as Counsellor to the White House,
