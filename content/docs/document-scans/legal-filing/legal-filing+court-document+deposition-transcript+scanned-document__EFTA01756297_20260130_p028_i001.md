<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Land exchanges betw=en Israel and the Palestinian territories are 
likely to be part of any fin=l peace settlement, an outcome that could be complicated by views held by =mericans. While 
only four-in-ten American 
Jews (40 percent) believe the land that is now Israel was given to the Jew=sh people by God, this sentiment is held by an 
overwhelming majority of Or=hodox Jews (84 percent). Fewer Reform Jews (35 percent) share this sentime=t. Notably, 
other Pew surveys show 
that more American Christians than Jews actually believe God gave Israel t= the Jews: 55 percent of U.S. Christians, 
including 82 percent of white ev=ngelical Protestants. 
</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">As the peace talks =rogress, the role played by the United States 
may become ever more of an i=sue. Today, more than half of American Jews say U.S. support for Israel is=about right 
(54 percent), although 
a substantial minority believes that Washington is not supportive enough or the Jewish state (31 percent). Just 11 
percent think the United States is=too supportive of Israel. By comparison, 41 percent of the general public =hinks 
support for Israel is about 
right, while the rest are nearly evenly divided between those who say Amer=ca is not supportive enough and those who 
say it is too supportive of the =ewish state. 
</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Opinions about U.S.=support for Israel vary considerably across 
denominations, with Orthodox J=ws (53 percent) particularly likely to say Washington is not supportive en=ugh, while 
only 30 percent of Reform 
Jews think America is not backing Jerusalem sufficiently. Interestingly, m=re white evangelical Protestants than Jews 
think the U.S. currently is not=sufficiently supportive of Israel (46 percent vs. 31 percent). 
</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">But there is reason=for hope. Indeed, looking into the future, 
American Jews are more optimist=c than the U.S. general public that a way can be found for Israel and an i=dependent 
Palestinian state to coexist 
peacefully: 61 percent of American Jews say this is possible, compared wit= 50 percent of the public overall. But, again, 
all Jews do not agree. Majo=ities of Reform (58 percent) and Conservative (62 percent) Jews think peac=ful coexistence 
is possible. But 
most Orthodox Jews (61 percent) do not believe a two-state solution will w=rk. </span> 
</P> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">So, as Washington r=mps up its efforts to get the Israelis and 
Palestinians to fashion a lasti=g settlement of their differences, there is no uniform American Jewish vie=point on the 
peace process. American 
Jews are hopeful about the objective, but divided on the details. And the =iew held by many foreigners, that Jewish 
Americans are knee-jerk supporter= of the Israeli position on the Palestinian territories, is just wrong.
