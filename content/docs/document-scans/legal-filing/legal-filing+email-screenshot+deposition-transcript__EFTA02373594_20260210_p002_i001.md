increased grant funding, we should be able to finally make an honest effort at implementing a non-trivial subset of 
OpenCog... [I can also send you the full grant proposals if you wish, though they are somewhat a mix of science-ese and 
proposal-ese as is usual in such cases...) 
Ah, and btw -- my in-depth book on how to build an AGI ("Engineering General Intelligence") is being published early 
next year, in two volumes, FINALLY ...

I will send you copies when they are available... ;) 
Finally -- while your help with the next 10% payment will be VERY much appreciated, it remains the case that our 
progress toward AGI would be accelerated dramatically with additional funding from a visionary such as yourself. The 
HK government money is very welcome yet has some strings attached -- basically you can only use it to hire "postdoc" / 
"research associate" type people, not experienced professionals. I can't use the money to pay myself, nor to pay 
someone with a decade or two of professional Al programming experience, nor experienced Al researchers for that 
matter. 
If you were able to provide a higher level of help, this could of course dramatically accelerate our progress toward AGI. 
In this spirit, I have been thinking of putting together a proposal for a cross-university collaboration on AGI, including 
adding a few senior staff to my own team at Hong Kong Poly U, some funds for Joscha and a couple assistants to work 
on the motivation/action-selection aspects, and for Itamar to hire some assistants to work on perception 
and action at UTK. If you would be interested to consider such a 
proposal, in the vicinity of say US$750K/year for 3 years (with clearly defined interim milestones along the way), let me 
know. This level of course is not "AGI Brooklyn Project" scale, but it would still provide a very major boost to our AGI 
efforts. 
Next, a slightly more personal update.... Right now I am spending half my time on OpenCog and half on Aidyia, our AI-
based proto-hedge fund. 
The hedge fund project is going OK; we've been doing lots of research and software development on machine learning 
applied to financial 
markets, and expect to start trading perhaps Q2 of next year. I have 
some equity in Aidyia, so if it succeeds, I'll get a bunch of money at some point in N years. However, I am very bored 
with financial market analysis and eager to spend more of my time on AGI, especially with this additional OpenCog grant 
money. During 2014 I plan to segue into spending more and more time on OpenCog and the quest for AGI, which is 
what I really love, while continuing to help Aidyia with high-level Al advisement... 
Assuming the fund project goes OK and we launch the fund in mid-2014 as expected, I will contact you about possible 
interest in putting AUM into the fund. 
A 48 minute documentary was made about my and Hugo de Garis's 
AI/robotics work in Xiamen in 2009, by the way. It's not terribly 
meaty science-wise, but, toward the end are some *great• conversations with a robot chat system that Ruiting (now my 
wife) and I built....
