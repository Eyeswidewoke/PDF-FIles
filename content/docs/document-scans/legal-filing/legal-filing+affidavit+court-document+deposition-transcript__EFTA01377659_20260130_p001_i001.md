the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock. These 
holders of our Class B common stock may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and 
which may be adverse to your interests. 
Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, 
subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers to entities, including certain charities and foundations, to the extent the 
transferor retains sole dispositive power and exclusive voting control with respect to the shares of Class B common stock. Shares 
sold by the selling stockholder in this offering will become Class A common stock upon such sale. Such conversions of Class B 
common stock to Class A common stock upon transfer will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of 
those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, our existing shareholders retain a 
significant portion of their holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, they could, in the future, continue to 
control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock. For a description of the dual class structure, see 
the section titled "Description of Capital Stock? 
We will incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public 
company. 
As a public company, we will incur significant legal, finance, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. 
We will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and will 
be required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act, as well as the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the listing standards of 
the New York Stock Exchange, including changes in corporate governance practices and the establishment and maintenance of 
effective disclosure and financial controls. Following this offering, we will be required to furnish a report by management on, among 
other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year beginning after the effective date 
of this offering. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our 
internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on our 
management's assessment of our internal controls. We expect that complying with these requirements will increase our legal and 
financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our 
management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial 
time to these requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward 
ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will increase when we are no longer 
an emerging growth company. as defined by the JOBS Act. We will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with 
appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and maintain an internal audit function. Moreover, we 
could incur additional compensation costs in the event that we decide to pay cash compensation closer to that of other public 
technology companies, which would increase our general and administrative expenses and could materially and adversely affect our 
profitability.

If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, investors may 
lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A common 
stock may be materially and adversely affected. 
We are currently evaluating our internal controls, identifying and remediating deficiencies in those internal controls, and 
documenting the results of our evaluation, testing, and remediation. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and 
any required remediation in a timely fashion. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial 
reporting that we are unable to remediate before the end of the same fiscal year in which the material weakness is identified, or if 
we are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal 
controls are effective. If we are unable to do so, or if our auditors are unable to attest to management's report on the effectiveness 
of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could 
cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. For example, we identified a significant deficiency in our internal control 
over financial reporting during the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, which related to a 
discrepancy in the reconciliation of a sub-ledger. A significant deficiency is a control deficiency, or combination of control 
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit 
attention by those responsible for oversight of a company's financial reporting. We have taken steps to remediate our control 
deficiencies. However, our efforts to remediate them may not be effective or prevent any future deficiency in our internal control 
over financial reporting. We will be required to disclose material changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a 
hap:thyme.
