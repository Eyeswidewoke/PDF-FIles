Given the need for investment in African agriculture, =here is no reason that foreign farmland investment on the 
continent =annot be structured as a win-win for both private equity investors and =he host country populations. 
It is actually a disservice =o those concerned with food security in Africa to simply paint all =armland investment on the 
continent as inherently bad. With the =ight guidelines and intentions, private equity farmland investments in =frica can 
be both ethical and profitable. 
In addition, as with many major trends in =he world today, a large reason behind the rapid run-up in food prices =s 
China's development. As investors we always want to be on the =orrect side of global macro trends, and whatever 
China needs or is =uying lots of, we want to own as investments. 
The question =s what are the best ways for making money from the agricultural sector? =ne way is to invest directly into 
agriculture stocks such as farm =quipment maker John Deere (DE), global seed giant Monsanto (MON) or =ertilizer 
company Potash Corp of Saskatchewan (POT). Another =ethod is to invest in agricultural futures through Exchange 
Traded =unds (ETFs) such as AIGA on the London Stock Exchange or DBC in the US =hich tracks an entire basket of 
agricultural commodities including =orn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, sugar, coffee, cattle and pigs. These =ommodities 
ETFs try to track the spot price of the various commodities =hey include. 
The advantage of these stocks or ETFs is that they =re easily tradable by anyone who has an online brokerage account. 
The =isadvantage, however, is that they are still financial instruments, and =s such can fluctuate widely in price. 
One option most individual =nvestors tend to overlook is direct investment in farmland. In =any ways, a farmland 
investment is more secure, stable and tangible =hen putting money into stocks. Farmland allows investors to still 
=enefit from the global trends in agriculture we have discussed, whilst =roviding much greater stability then agriculture 
stocks or commodities =hich can fluctuate wildly. 
In the last 20 =ears farmland in the United States has never had a down year, as this =able from the National Council of 
Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries =NCREIF) in the US demonstrates. 
Not surprisingly, =any large institutional investors have been investing heavily in =armland the last several years. For 
example TIAA-CREF, one of the =argest pension funds in the world, has recently made a large move into =armland 
investing. 
Prices for farmland in the West — =articularly in Europe - have already moved up considerably, reaching as =igh E17,300 
per hectare in the northwest of England to take just one =xample. Whilst there are considerable advantages in terms of 
=olitical stability to farmland investment in Europe or the US, the real =pportunities for spectacular gains lie in emerging 
markets, especially =n Africa, which holds 60% of the world's remaining arable land =uitable for farming. 
Whilst farmland investment has been =ominated by larger institutions historically, in just the last two =ears a number of 
options have been developed for individuals. The =ost common is to pool a number of individual investors' capital 
=ogether to purchase a large parcel of land, and then divide it into =ndividual freehold parcels. Farmland investments for 
individuals =enerally pay a regular yearly dividend from the sale of crops, and also =rovide the opportunity for long-term 
capital gains as farmland =ontinues to increase in value. 
We are now starting =o see options starting as low as E1,950/hectare for high quality =armland in Africa, as well as 
opportunities in Australian and =rgentinean farmland that are easilt accessible by =ndividuals. 
There are, of course, risks with any investment, but =y doing one's due-diligence and investing in the right structure with 
=he right people and institution, farmland investment can be both safe =nd profitable for individual investors as well as 
large =nstitutions.
