For certain securities, including thinly-traded securities, debt securities in default, securities that do not have a valid pricing source, and certain third-party structured products, the last available pricing will be 
listed. If the last price avaiable for such securities is unchanged for a period of time deemed appropriate for that asset, the current price will purge and N/A will be placed in the price field in the statement. The
