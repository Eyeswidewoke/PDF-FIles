2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93633, * 
2 PrehjUdICO 10 Carroll 
The second Poulis factor considers prejudice to the appellee caused by the appellant's 
failure to meet scheduling orders and respond to discovery. 747 F.2d at 868. [HN6] 
Prejudice for the purpose of the Poulis factors "does not mean 'irremediable harm."' See 
Ware, 322 F.3d at 222; see also Curtis T. Bedwell and Sons, Inc. v. Intl Fidelity Ins. Co., 
843 F.2d 683, 693-94 (3d Cir. 1988) (rejecting the argument that "the district rioi court 
should not have dismissed its claim ... unless the harm to the other parties amounted to 
'irremediable prejudice"'). Rather, the burden imposed by impeding the opposing party's 
ability to prepare a meaningful litigation strategy has been held to be sufficiently 
prejudicial. See Ware, 322 F.3d at 222. 
Carroll argues that he has "incurred costs and fees of bringing the underlying adversary 
proceeding and opposing North Shore's late filings." (Carroll's Opp'n Mot. Leave to File 
Untimely Resp. 5, ECF No. 5). Carroll also argues that he "should not be made to incur the 
additional costs to oppose an appeal that North Shore failed to address for several 
months, particularly when North Shore's current default merely continues its dilatory 
performance in the underlying bankruptcy proceeding." Id. 
Additional costs and fees do not necessarily amount to prejudice. However, it is clear that 
North Shore's conduct has prejudiced Carroll by hampering his ability to resolve the 
underlying bankruptcy matter. See Lee, 455 Fed. Appx. at 201-202 (finding that the 
plaintiffs conduct prejudiced the defendants by "impeding their efforts to resolve [the] 
case, causing them to file unnecessary rill motions, and requiring them to incur extra 
expenses.") The Court also notes that the Bankruptcy Division has stayed execution as to 
the bank account involved in the underlying matter, pending resolution of this appeal. 
Consequently, North Shore's lengthy delay has had an impact on the Bankruptcy Division's 
proceedings. Thus, the Court finds that the second Poulis factor weighs in favor of 
dismissal. 
3. History or Dostortness 
[HN7] The third Poulis factor considers the appellant's history of dilatoriness. 747 F.2d at 
868. North Shore did not file its brief within the original time period set by the Court. North 
Shore also failed to move for an extension of time within which to file its brief until more 
than six months after the Court's deadline. Additionally, North Shore did not file its brief 
within the extended time period set by the Court. Indeed, rather than trying to make up for 
lost time in the more than seven months since its brief was originally due, North Shore has 
elected not to file even a brief in compliance with the Court's extended time period. 
Similarly, North Shore did not file oppositions to Carroll's motions to dismiss this appeal. 
The Court also notes the history leading ['1 2] up to this appeal. As the Bankruptcy Court 
noted in its May 26, 2010, judgment, 
As established by the record of the entire Adversary and the docket. North Shore has set upon a pattern and practice 
of filing pleadings after the deadlines have passed: (1) North Shore's initial opposition to the first Motion for Summary 
Judgment was due on November 2.2008. but was actually filed on November 30. 2009: more than a year after the due 
date. (2) North Shore obtained leave of court to file a late opposition to Trustee% motion for entry of default and default 
judgment. having missed that deadline. (3) North Shore filed a late response to the renewed Motion for Summary
