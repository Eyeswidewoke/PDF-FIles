Corporate Credit: Back to school - The edge of normality 
the whole of the EUR, GBP and USD complex are mostly considerably wider 
than where they were at the start of the last two years at least. Indeed as we'll 
see in this piece, some areas of the market (mostly USD credit) are trading at 
what we would call 'the edge of normality' - they've only been wider for 
periods where you've had a genuine crisis rather than simply a sell-off. 
The recent volatility originally stems from a stronger dollar, weaker Chinese 
growth, weaker commodities and expectations of the start of a Fed hiking 
cycle. However it quickly morphed into a China crisis as the equity bubble 
burst and the authorities there were perhaps inconsistent in their subsequent 
interventions with it being unclear at various points whether they would 
prevent further falls or let markets find the clearing level. As uncertainly over 
the economy simultaneously grew, the devaluations in the 2nd week of August 
sparked a mini currency war/panic in EM and suspicions of further skirmishes 
to come even if China's motivation could have genuinely been to attain SDR 
status with the IMF. At the moment there is no clarity as to what China's short 
to medium term policy objectives/tools are. This has created confusion. This all 
then came to a head in the worst month possible - i.e. at the peak of holiday 
season - in what are already lower volume trading markets due to increased 
banking regulations. The knock-on effects have therefore been amplified. This 
provides opportunities if you think a global growth slowdown can be avoided 
for now. 
So what hAppen,; next' 
Well the Fed is now (on balance) expected to relent from a September hike and 
possibly for much longer in our opinion. China is likely to have to find ways of 
stimulating/intervening further and it's not inconceivable that the ECB and BoJ 
will eventually increase their already extreme money printing operations as 
inflation continues to frustrate on the low side. So we don't think it's the end 
of the central bank liquidity era yet and as such we would want to continue to 
have a bias towards owning credit product even if we think the global financial 
system is extremely flawed. Clearly the main near-term central bank focal point 
is the Fed. What happens if they do decide to raise rates? 
Should We worry alxml a Fed hike it It does happen' 
History tells us we shouldn't worry for at least 12-18 months. Figure 5 shows 
what happened to US BBB spreads in the three years before and after the first 
and last hike in the last 12 hiking cycles stretching back to the early 1950s. As 
can be seen, spreads tend to tighten on average for 12 months after the first 
hike in the cycle before reversing course over the next two years. This perhaps 
shows the usual lag of monetary policy on financial markets and the economy. 
This is backed up by the graph on the right showing that the last hike in the 
cycle is generally followed by widening credit spreads.
