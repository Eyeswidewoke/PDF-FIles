partners. TSMC, 5K, and Samsung, for example, have announced tens of billions of dollars in U.S. 
investments over the past four years, and the Biden-Harris Administration has leveraged companies and 
expertise from Japan, Canada, and Norway for announcements related to U.S. ports and shipbuilding. U.S. 
officials, meanwhile, have encouraged allies to adopt industrial policy measures of their own in key sectors, 
such as Europe's clean energy-focused Green Deal. Please join the Carnegie Endowment's American 
Statecraft Program for a conversation on these issues with Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh. 
. CARNEGIE: International Models for Governing Gaza— Thursday, September 19, 2024. Location: Carnegie, 
9:00 AM. Various proposals are circulating for the "day after" in Gaza, many of which envision interim 
international arrangements to assist with the rehabilitation. International transitional authorities have been 
established in the past for the administration of war-torn territories, notably the United Nations 
administrations of Kosovo and East Timor, and the High Representative's administration of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. Is an international transitional authority a viable and attractive option for Gaza? What would 
its mandate be? Would the mission have a defined political horizon (such as Palestinian statehood)? What do 
the historical parallels tell us? What would be the role of the United Nations and regional parties in such an 
arrangement? How would the cooperation of the immediately affected parties—Israelis and Palestinians—
be achieved? Join Paul Dziatkowiec as he moderates an expert panel discussion to explore these issues and 
others concerning the future of governance in Gaza. This event is co-organized by the Middle East Program 
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Oxford University. 
. American Building the Future: Innovative Solutions to the U.S. Housing Crisis — Thursday, September 19, 
2024. Location: Center of American Progress, 9:00 AM. Inadequate supply is the root cause of the housing 
affordability crisis. The rate of production of new units has been too low for more than a decade, and the 
supply of entry-level single-family homes and affordable rental units has greatly lagged behind demand. 
Nationally, nearly half of all rental households are cost burdened. To solve the U.S. housing crisis, the path 
ahead must dramatically boost the supply of housing through policies that will spur building—by reforming 
local zoning regulations and identifying innovative financing opportunities—and do so in a way that is 
sustainable and fosters communities that Americans want to live, work, and gather in. Please join the Center 
for American Progress for a policy summit that lays out a vision for a future with affordable, accessible 
housing, and policy solutions to turn that vision into a reality for all types of communities. 
. AEI: The Forgotten Solution to the Housing Crunch: A Premiere of the AEI Housing Center's Documentary on 
Light-Touch Density —Thursday, September 19, 2024. Location: AEI Auditorium, 11:00 AM. American home 
prices have risen nearly SO percent in just four years, and the two sides of the housing reform war haven't 
budged an inch. One side wants high-density apartments, and the other opposes changing single-family 
detached zoning. Is there a third way to keep housing more affordable? One American city suggests there is. 
Please join us for the premiere of The Forgotten Solution to the Housing Crunch, a nine-minute documentary 
that highlights Charlotte, North Carolina, and explains how light-touch density (LTD) can create housing 
abundance by legalizing small-scale residential development that is compatible with single-family detached 
neighborhoods. LTD adds homes, but unlike subsidized housing, it requires no subsidies, income limits, rent 
control, or federal government involvement in zoning decisions. Formal and informal discussions will follow 
the documentary premiere. 
• Wilson Center: Uruguay Goes to the Polls— Thursday, September 19, 2024. Location: Wilson Center, 10:00 
AM. In 2019, Uruguayans elected conservative Luis Lacalle Pou as president following 15 years of rule by the 
center-left Frente Amplio coalition. Five years later, Lacalle Pou remains popular. Ineligible to run for 
immediate reelection on October 27, he is instead running for Senate and a close ally and former member of 
his cabinet, Alvaro Delgado, is representing the National Party. A centrist former mayor of Canelones, 
Yamando Orsi, won the Frente Amplio primary in June. Incumbent parties have had it rough in Latin America 
in recent years, but the ruling National Party has several advantages, including growing agricultural 
production following a prolonged drought. The Frente Amplio will emphasize public concerns about crime 
and a scandal involving Uruguayan passports issued to criminals. Either candidate would likely maintain 
strong ties to the United States, but the election could reshape Uruguay's approach to foreign policy 
challenges such as the collapse of democracy in Venezuela. To learn more, please join the Wilson Center's 
Latin America Program on Thursday, September 19, 2024, from 10:00 am to 11:00 am ET, for a conversation 
about Uruguay's presidential election, with insights from experts including Lacalle Pou's father, former
