Arrests for Assaults on Federal Officers Surge Threefold in Trump's First Year Back in White House 
Breitbart (11/25, Boyle) reported that arrests for assaults on federal officers have surged threefold in 2025 
compared to the previous administration, according to FBI data. The increase is attributed to the Trump 
administration's support for federal law enforcement officers and a crackdown on violent crime. "The FBI has 
tripled our number of arrests for Assault on Federal Officers this year compared to the previous administration, and 
that is no accident," Director Patel told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement. "President Trump and his 
administration have put a premium on supporting the men and women who go out in the field and do the hard 
work of cleaning up our streets, and the FBI is proud to be a part of that mission. We will continue our push to 
crush violent crime all across this country and support our partners doing the same. Anyone who comes after an 
officer fulfilling their duties will be met with the full weight of justice under this FBI." The article highlighted that 
the FBI also told Breitbart News that the top FBI offices by volume where these arrests happened are in the 
following cities: Chicago, Washington DC, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Portland. "This FBI is proud to work with our 
federal, state, and local partners all across the country to crush violent crime and deliver historic results in making 
America safe again — and we will continue to aggressively pursue those who attack law enforcement simply for 
doing their jobs," FBI spokesman Ben Williamson added in a statement. 
FBI Probes Congressional Democrats Who Warned Military About Illegal Orders 
Reuters (11/25, Winter, Ax) reported that the FBI has requested interviews with six Democratic lawmakers who 
warned members of the military that they can legally refuse to carry out unlawful orders. According to the article, 
the lawmakers, including Senator Mark Kelly and Representatives Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio, 
Chrissy Houlahan, and Senator Elissa Slotkin, claim the FBI move is an attempt by the Trump administration to 
silence them. The article explained that the probe comes after the lawmakers released a video stating that military 
personnel can refuse to follow illegal orders, which President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth 
have described as "seditious" acts. "The President directing the FBI to target us is exactly why we made this video 
in the first place," U.S. Senator Slotkin of Michigan, a former CIA officer, said on X. "This is not the America I know, 
and I'm not going to let this next step from the FBI stop me from speaking up for my country, and our Constitution." 
The Associated Press (11/25, Cappelletti, Householder) added that the FBI declined to comment Tuesday, but 
Director Patel, in an interview with journalist Catherine Herridge, described it as an "ongoing matter" in explaining 
why he could not discuss details. Asked for his reaction to the video, Director Patel said, "What goes through my 
head is the same thing that goes through my head in any case: is there a lawful predicate to open up an inquiry and 
investigation, or is there not? And that decision will be made by the career agents and analysts here at the 
FBI." Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (11/25, Barr, Siegel, Murray), Al Jazeera (11/25,
