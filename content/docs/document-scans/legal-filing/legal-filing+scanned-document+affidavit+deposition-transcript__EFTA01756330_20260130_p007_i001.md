Shimon Peres who was also a panelist. And Is=aelis started to accuse Fidan almost at the same time as he was the 
Turkis= sherpa during the U.N.-sponsored efforts on Iran's nuclear program, bef=re becoming MIT's head. 
Ankara thinks the W= story is part of a campaign that started with a Wall Street Journal story=printed on Oct. 9 saying 
Fidan was acting "independently" on Syria ope=ations, jeopardizing Western interests there. The story also noted that 
the discomfort of the U.S. administration=was increased during a May 16 lunch at the White House put on by U.S. 
Pres=dent Barack Obama for Erdogan in the presence of Fidan, Turkish Foreign =inister Ahmet Davutoglu, U.S. Secretary 
of State John Kerry and Obama's national security adviser, Tom Danilon. =he WSJ story said Fidan was responsible for 
Turkey's soft stance regardi=g al-Qaeda-affiliated opposition groups in the Syrian civil war. 
Both of the stories=were refuted by Davutoglu on Oct. 17. "The claims attributed to Hakan =idan are both untrue and an 
example of very bad, black propaganda. Fidan i= doing his job," he said. 
But the feelings in the Turkish government regarding the "campaign" are=stronger than those on-the-record words of 
Davutoglu. One government off=cial pointed to the timing of the media reports "targeting" Fidan. Therofficial said the 
campaign coincided with approaching Syria talks in Geneva, which are expected to take place in lat= November, and a 
dramatic change in Iran's relations with the West under=its new president, Hassan Rouhani. 
Since a telephone c=nversation between Obama and Rouhani on Sept. 27 during U.N. General Assem=ly talks, the top 
diplomats of both countries have officially met for the =irst time since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The discussion led 
to the quick restart of diplomatic efforts for=direct talks on Iran's nuclear program with the P5+1 countries. = 
Israeli Prime Minis=er Benjamin Neta=yahu did not hide his uneas= at the rapprochement, immediately flying to 
Washington D.C. to warn Obama=on Sept. 30 that Irang=pan> was a "wolf in sheep's cl=thing." 
When asked about th= WP story on the claim of "revealing the Israeli spy ring in Turkey to t=e Iranians," U.S. State 
Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki did not make a=y comment but said the U.S. had been working with the Turks as an 
ally on a range of issues and that the report had not=changed relations with Turkey. 
Sources in apan class="MsoHyperlink">Ankara<=span> believe that besides trying to defa=e Turkey in U.S. eyes as a 
country tolerating terrorists like Iran — and beca=se of its "independent tack" on Syria, amid an effort to try and corne= it 
in a possible move in the U.S. Congress — l=rael might have had another=motivation. That might be, according to those 
sources who asked not to be =amed, an attempt to avoid paying compensation for the nine Turks killed by Israeli 
commandoes on May 31, 2010, on board =he Mavi Marmara on its way to carry humanitarian aid to the Gaza 
Strip.&nb=p; 
After the official =pology from Netanyahu (which was brokered by Obama) on March 24, talks sta=ted for compensation 
to the families of the victims, albeit with no result= as Israel=/span> does not want to make the p=yments in the form of 
"compensation," according to Israeli diplomatic =ources talking to HDN. 
Also, Erdogan's=close relations with Hamas are another source of disturbance between the t=o. By coincidence, Khaled 
Mashaal, the leader of Hamas, was received by Er=ogan in his office in Ankara=/span> on Oct. 9, the same day tha= the 
WSJ story published. 
On Syria, Turkey ha= been taking more careful steps regarding al-Qaeda-affiliated groups fight=ng in the civil war there. 
Turkish intelligence sources have admitt=d to HDN that there were a =umber of operative and diplomatic steps taken in 
parallel with the demands=of the U.S., the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia since Erdogan's May 16 meeting with 
Obama. 
Davutoglu said su=sequent telephone conversations on Oct. 16 with Kerry and French=/span> counterpart Laurent 
Fabius =hat Turkey was going to be part of the Geneva talks (which have mainly bee= a U.S.-Russian matter until now) 
for the future of Syria and the Bashar al-Assad regime there.
