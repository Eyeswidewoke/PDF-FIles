United States Courts Opinions: Supreme Court of New York: Neary v Burns US Official 
News April 1, 2014 Tuesday 
defense further alleged that plaintiffs' amended complaint should be dismissed for failure 
to join indispensable parties. Burns' fourth affirmative defense alleged that the court lacks 
subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims. 
Following discussions with the attorneys for the McRory defendants and limited document 
production by them, plaintiffs, by a Stipulation of Discontinuance dated January 27, 2012, 
discontinued this action as against the McRory defendants. On February 23, 2012, Grace 
(who, as noted above, was Burns' mother and a member of 2784 LLC) died at the age of 
99 years. 
By notice of motion dated March 6, 2013, plaintiffs moved for a default judgment, pursuant 
to CPLR 3215, against 2784 LLC. On April 4, 2013, plaintiffs withdrew that motion and 
extended the time for 2784 LLC to serve an answer to their amended complaint in 
exchange for its production of bank statements for its checking account, which 2784 LLC 
produced in or about the end of May 2013. 2784 LLC has not yet interposed an answer to 
plaintiffs' amended complaint. 
On June 28, 2013, Burns produced some documents in response to a February 25, 2013 
notice to produce for discovery and inspection which was served by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs 
assert that their review of 2784 LLC's bank statements and other documents produced in 
this action have revealed that they have direct claims against Burns and 2784 LLC for the 
alleged wrongful withholding from them of over $80,000 in distributions due to them from 
the net sale proceeds from the 2784 premises. 
On September 11, 2013, plaintiffs moved for leave to serve an amended summons and 
second amended verified complaint. Plaintiffs sought to amend the summons and first 
amended complaint to delete the McRory defendants from the caption and to remove the 
cause of action asserted as against them to reflect their voluntary discontinuance of all 
claims against them. Plaintiffs further sought to amend the first amended complaint in 
order to limit it to direct claims against 2784 LLC and Burns solely for wrongfully 
["5]withholding from them over $80,000 in distributions due to them from the net sale 
proceeds from the 2784 premises. 
Plaintiffs' second amended verified complaint (annexed as exhibit A to plaintiffs' motion 
papers in motion sequence number 2) alleges that Neary is a member of 2784 LLC, having 
a 6.133% ownership interest therein. It further alleges that Benevento has a 9.2% 
beneficial interest in 2784 LLC through the Estate of Julia, who was a member of 2784 
LLC, having a 18.4% ownership interest therein, and that Benevento was and is the co-
executor of the Estate of Julia and is entitled to 50% of Julia's estate. 
Plaintiffs' second amended complaint sets forth that on January 20, 2010, 2784 LLC, 
under the sole and exclusive management of Burns, sold the 2784 premises to M & A 
Realty Services, LLC for the sum of $1,050,000. It alleges that as of January 22, 2010, the 
sum of $544,018.29 was available for distribution to 2784 LLC members from the net 
proceeds of the sale of the 2784 premises, and that, as of March 9, 2010, distributions of 
the net proceeds from the sale of the 2784 premises were made to 2784 LLC members, 
including distributions paid directly to Neary and Benevento, as members. It asserts that 
Burns, in breach of independent fiduciary duties he owed to Neary and Benevento in their 
own, individual capacities, unilaterally and wrongfully withheld from them their fair share of
