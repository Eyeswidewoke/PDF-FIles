But now, former top=German officials have admitted to the nuclear dimension for the first time= "I assumed from the 
very beginning that the submarines were supposed=to be nuclear-capable," says Hans R0hle, the head of the planning 
staff at the German Defense Ministry in the late =980s. Lothar ROI, a former state secretary in the Defense Ministry, 
say= that he never doubted that "Israel stationed nuclear weapons on the =hips." And Wolfgang Ruppelt, the director of 
arms procurement at the Defense Ministry during the key phase, admits t=at it was immediately clear to him that the 
Israelis wanted the ships &quo=;as carriers for weapons of the sort that a small country like Israel cann=t station on 
land." Top German officials speaking under the protection of anonymity were even more forthcoming. &qu=t;From the 
beginning, the boats were primarily used for the purposes of nu=lear capability," says one ministry official with 
knowledge of the ma=ter. 
Insiders say that t=e Israeli defense technology company Rafael built the missiles for the nuc=ear weapons option. 
Apparently it involves a further development of cruise=missiles of the Popeye Turbo SLCM type, which are supposed to 
have a range of around 1,500 kilometers (940 miles) irnd which could reach Iran with a warhead weighing up to 200 
kilograms (440=pounds). The nuclear payload comes from the Negev Desert, where Israel has=operated a reactor and an 
underground plutonium separation plant in Dimona since the 1960s. The question of how =eveloped the Israeli cruise 
missiles are is a matter of debate. Their deve=opment is a complex project, and the missiles' only public manifestation 
w=s a single test that the Israelis conducted off the coast of Sri Lanka. 
The submarines are =he military response to the threat in a region "where there is no mer=y for the weak," Defense 
Minister Ehud Barak says. They are an insura=ce policy against the Israelis' fundamental fear that "the Arabs could 
slaughter us tomorrow," as David Ben-Gurio=, the founder of the State of Israel, once said. "We shall never agai= be led 
as lambs to the slaughter," was the lesson Ben-Gurion and oth=rs drew from Auschwitz. 
Armed with nuclear =eapons, the submarines are a signal to any enemy that the Jewish state its=lf would not be totally 
defenseless in the event of a nuclear attack, but =ould strike back with the ultimate weapon of retaliation. The 
submarines are "a way of guaranteeing that=the enemy will not be tempted to strike pre-emptively with non-
conventiona= weapons and get away scot-free," as Israeli Admiral Avraham Botzer p=ts it. 
Questions of Global=Political Responsibility 
In this version of =it-for-tat, known as nuclear second-strike capability, hundreds of thousan=s of dead are avenged with 
an equally large number of casualties. It is a =trategy the United States and Russia practiced during the Cold War by 
constantly keeping part of its nuclear ar=enal ready on submarines. For Israel, a country about the size of the Germ=n 
state of Hesse, which could be wiped out with a nuclear strike, safeguar=ing this threat potential is vital to its very 
existence. At the same time, the nuclear arsenal causes countr=es like Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia to regard Israel's 
nuclear capacity w=th fear and envy and consider building their own nuclear weapons.</=> 
This makes the ques=ion of its global political responsibility all the more relevant for Germa=y. Should Germany, the 
country of the perpetrators, be allowed to assist l=rael, the land of the victims, in the development of a nuclear weapons 
arsenal capable of extinguishing hundreds=of thousands of human lives? 
Is Berlin recklessl= promoting an arms race in the Middle East? Or should Germany, as its hist=ric obligation stemming 
from the crimes of the Nazis, assume a responsibil=ty that has become "part of Germany's reason of state," as 
Chancellor Merkel said in a speech to the Israel= parliament, the Knesset, in March 2008? "It means that for me, as a 
=erman chancellor, Israel's security is never negotiable," Merkel told=the lawmakers. 
The perils of such =nconditional solidarity were addressed by Germany's new president, Joachim=Gauck, during his first 
official visit to Jerusalem last Tuesday: "I =on't want to imagine every scenario that could get the chancellor in 
tremendous trouble, when it comes to political=y implementing her statement that Israel's security is part of Germany's 
r=ason of state."
