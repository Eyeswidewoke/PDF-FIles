S-I/A 
Securities Act, (2) a registration in which the only stock being registered is common stock issuable upon conversion of debt 
securities also being registered, or (3) a registration on any form that does not include substantially the same information as would 
be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of our common stock, the holders of these shares are 
entitled to notice of the registration and have the right, subject to certain limitations, to include their shares in the registration. 
S-3 Registration Rights 
After the completion of this offering, the holders of up to 150,009,457 shares of our Class B common stock (including shares 
issuable pursuant to the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of our capital stock that were outstanding as of September 30. 
2015) will be entitled to certain Form S-3 registration rights. Any holder of these shares then outstanding can request that we 
register the offer and sale of their shares of our common stock on a registration statement on Form S-3 if we are eligible to file a 
registration statement on Form S-3 so long as the request covers securities the anticipated aggregate public offering price of which, 
before payment of underwriting discounts and commissions, is at least 510 million. These stockholders may make an unlimited 
number of requests for registration on a registration statement on Form S-3. However, we will not be required to effect a 
registration on Form S-3 if we have effected two such registrations within the 12-month period preceding the date of the request. 
Additionally, if we determine that it would be seriously detrimental to us and our stockholders to effect such a registration, we have 
the right to defer such registration, not more than once in any 12-month period, for a period of up to 120 days. In addition, we are 
not obligated to effect any such registration within 180 days following the effective date of a registration pursuant to which holders 
have 'piggyback" registration rights as described above. 
Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Delaware Law, Our Amended and Restated Certificate of 
incorporation, and Our Amended and Restated Bylaws 
Certain provisions of Delaware law and certain provisions that will be included in our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws summarized below may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, 
deter, or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interests, including attempts 
that might result in a premium being paid over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. 
Dual Class Stock 
As described above in "—Class A and Class B Common Stock—Voting Rights,' our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure, which provides our founders. current investors. executives, and 
employees with significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and 
significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. 
Preferred Stock 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that permit our board of directors to issue, without 
any further vote or action by the stockholders, shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each such 
series, to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting rights (if any) of the shares 
of the series, and the powers, preferences, or relative, participation, optional, and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, 
limitations, or restrictions, of the shares of such series.

Classified Board 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is divided into three classes, 
designated Class I, Class II, and Class III. Each class will be an equal number of directors, as nearly as possible, consisting of 
one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire board of directors. The term of initial Class I directors shall 
terminate on the date of the 2016 annual meeting, the term of the initial Class II directors shall terminate on the date of the 2017 
annual meeting, and the term of the initial Class III directors shall terminate on the date of the 2018 annual meeting. At each 
annual meeting of stockholders beginning in 2016, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting 
will be elected for a three-year term.
