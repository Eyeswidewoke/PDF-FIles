military capacity following the withdrawal of the bulk of American ground troops there. Brazil was the third biggest 
buyer, primarily of Swedish aircraft. 
In the years since, however, the former Bush official has established himself as a prominent critic of U.S. foreign policy. 
"1 think Sme=ley Butler was onto something," explained Lawrence Wilkerson, in an ext=nded interview with Salon. In his 
day, in the early 20th century, Butler was the highest ranked and most honored official in the history of the U.S. 
Marine Corps. He helped lead wars throughout the world over a series of decades, before later becoming a vociferous 
opponent of American imperialism, declaring "war is a racket." 
Wilkerson spoke highly of Butler, referencing the late general's fa=ous 
quote: "Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hint=. The best he could do was to operate his racket in 
three districts. I operated on three continents." "I think the problem that Smedley id=ntified, quite eloquently actually," 
Wilkerson said, "especially for a Mar=ne — I had to say that as a soldier," the retired Army colonel added with a laugh= 
"I think the problem is much deeper and more profound today, and much more subtle and sophisticated." Today, the 
military-industrial complex =E2 is much more pernicious than Eisenhower ever thought it would be," Wilkerso= warned. 
In his farewell address in 1961, former President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower famously cautioned Americans that the military and corporate interests were increasingly working together, 
contrary to the best interests of the citizenry. He called this phenomenon the military-industrial complex. 
As a case study of how the contemporary military-industrial complex works, Wilkerson pointed to leading weapons 
corporations like Lockheed Martin, and their work with draconian, repressive Western-allied regimes in the Gulf, or in 
inflaming tensions in Korea. "Was Bill Clinton's exp=nsion of NATO — after George H. W. Bush and [his Secretary of 
State] James Baker had assured Gorbachev and then Yeltsin that we wouldn't go an inch furt=er east — was this for 
Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon, and Boeing, and other=, to increase their network of potential weapon sales?" 
Wilkerson asked. 
"You bet it was," he answered. "Is there a penchan= on behalf of the Congress to bless the use of force more often than 
not because of the constituencies they have and the money they get from the defense contractors?" Wilkerson 
continued. Again, he answered his own ques=ion: 
"You bet." 
"It's not like Dick Cheney or someone like that went and sa=d let's have a war because we want to make money for 
Halliburton, but it is a pernicious on decision-making," the former Bush official explained. "=nd the fact that they donate 
so much money to congressional elections and to PACs and so forth is another pernicious influence." "Those who 
deny=this are just being utterly naive, or they are complicit too," Wilkerson added. =E2 And some of my best friends 
work for Lockheed Martin," along with Rayth=on, Boeing and Halliburton, he quipped. 
Wilkerson — who in the same interview with Salon defended Edward Sn=wden, saying the whistle-blower performed an 
important service and did not endanger U.S. national security — was also intensely critical of th= growing movement to 
"privatize public functions, like prisons. =80 "I fault us Republicans for this majorly," he confessed — although a=good 
many prominent Democrats have also jumped on the neoliberal bandwagon. In a 
2011 speech, for instance, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared, "It's time for the United States to start thinking of 
Iraq =s a business opportunity" for U.S. corporations. 
Wilkerson lamented, "We've privatized the ultimate public f=nction: war."
