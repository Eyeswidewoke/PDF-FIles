General Events 
• Brookings: Renegotiating the USMCA: Next steps and key issues — Tuesday, October 28, 2025. Location: 
Online event, 2:00 PM. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is up for its first formal 
review in July 2026. Projections predict that this review, however, is shaping up to be more of a 
transformative renegotiation. Discussions are set to focus on areas of non-compliance, places where the 
agreement can be updated to reflect new global trade and multilateral realities, and how new U.S. tariffs 
may add complexities. 
• CSIS: Demining Ukraine: Outcomes from the 2025 Ukraine Mine Action Conference — Tuesday, October 28, 
2025. Location: Online event, 11:00 AM. Landmines and unexploded ordnance contaminate tens of 
thousands of hectares of farmland across Ukraine, preventing farmers from tending some of the most 
productive land in Europe. Facilitating expedient, safe demining procedures at scale remains a prerequisite 
for Ukraine's agricultural recovery and economic reconstruction broadly—especially as other significant 
economic activities like critical mineral mining depend on safe access to potentially contaminated land. 
• CSIS: Unpacking the CRINK Axis — Tuesday, October 28, 2025. Location: Online event, 2:00 PM. Join the CSIS 
Korea Chair for a discussion unpacking the growing ties among China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, which 
some have called a CRINK axis or an "Axis of Upheaval." 
• AEI: Election Watch 2026: One Year  (and One Week) Out — Tuesday, October 28, 2025. Location: AEI 
Auditorium, 12:00 PM. With just over a year until the 2026 midterms, AEI's Election Watch team will gather 
for a look at key off-year elections in New Jersey, New York City, and Virginia. The panel of election experts 
will also examine the latest on mid-decade redistricting, including a preview of California's special election 
on Proposition 50. What will all this mean for the midterm elections in 2026?
