Re: Notice to Cure 
November 17, 2016 
Page 3
"any waterfront facility of any kind, other than vessels not owned or operated by 
such facility, and related appurtenances located on land, including submerged lands, 
or on or under the surface of any kind of water, which facility and related 
appurtenances are used or capable of being used for the purpose of drilling for, 
pumping, storing, handling, transferring, processing or refining oil or other 
pollutants, including, but not limited to, any such facility and related appurtenances 
owned or operated by a public utility or a governmental or quasi-governmental 
body. A vessel shall be considered a terminal facility only in the event of a ship-to-
ship transfer of oil, petroleum products or their by-products and other pollutants, 
and only that vessel going to or coming from the place of transfer and the terminal 
facility. .." 
The two tanks in question, each with only a holding capacity of 2,000 gallons and 1,200 gallons, 
respectively, are not fuel storage tanks. They are not stand-alone tanks, but are part of the electricity 
generator on Great St. James Island. Neither they nor the generator were installed for the purpose of 
drilling for, pumping, storing, handling, transferring, processing or refining oil or other pollutants. 
Moreover, the tanks and the generator are well inland of any "waterfront" on Great St. James Island. 
For these reasons, Great St. Jim, LLC believed and still maintains that they do not require a terminal 
facility license. 
Although both tanks are double walled and do not require the installation of any barrier, should 
DPNR seek additional protection, Great St. Jim, LLC will install a barrier around the pad on which 
the ranks are situated as a redundant spill control measure. Clarification is respectfully requested as 
to what violations arc alleged with respect to the fuel tanks and what measures DPNR would require 
to address its concerns. 
Great St. Jim, LLC has been diligent in complying with DPNR's directives, particularly where what DPNR 
requested for compliance is evident, as is the case for the items cited in Section I, Paragraphs 7A and 7C of 
the Notice to Cure. As demonstrated by the attached photographs, any violations with respect to the 
concrete pad or the foundation materials cited in Section I, Paragraphs 7A and 7C of the Notice to Cure have 
been cured and the areas have been restored to their condition as of the time the Settlement Agreement was 
executed. This has been accomplished well within any cure period required under the Settlement Agreement 
and cannot be deemed a breach of the same. 
The Settlement Ag.ec iant resolved all of the alleged and disputed unpermitted development identified in the 
original April 22, 2016 NOVA (the "NOVA"), including, without limitation, the development of the area 
identified in Paragraph 7A and the development of the area of the site identified in Paragraph 7C on which 
the forms have been prepared for pouring concrete. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Great St. Jim, 
LLC paid a fine for the alleged unpermitted development in exchange for a release for the same, thereby 
eliminating any requirement to restore the cited areas to their condition prior to the execution of the 
Settlement Agreement. 
Moreover, any environmental impact in connection with the unpermitted development alleged by the NOVA 
had already been resolved by the Settlement Agreement. Neither item identified in Section I, Paragraph 7A 
or 7C of the Notice to Cure is a source of additional adverse environmental impact. Indeed, left untouched, 
the sites of alleged unpermitted development in the NOVA could potentially be sources of soil erosion, blow 
off and runoff, and the concrete covering identified in Paragraphs 7A and C would have substantially 
mitigated any potential for soil erosion, blow off or runoff.
