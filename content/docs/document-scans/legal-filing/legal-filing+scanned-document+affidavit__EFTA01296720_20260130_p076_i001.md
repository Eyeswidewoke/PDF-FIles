the CVRA. (DE 265 at 13). Second, they argue that the doctrine does not apply because 
the conduct of those prosecutors is a "central issue" in this case. (Id. at 15). The Courts 
finds these arguments unavailing. 
First, Petitioners argue that the "work product doctrine does not apply ['20] to claims 
advanced by crime victims that federal prosecutors have violated their public 
responsibilities under the Crime Victims' Rights Act." (Id. at 14). Because the CVRA 
compels prosecutors to make their "best efforts" to notify victims of their rights, Petitioners 
argue that the Government cannot withhold documents that "might allow them to protect 
those very rights." (Id. at 15). By way of illustration, Petitioners offer the case of In re 
Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, where the Eighth Circuit broadly stated that "the 
general duty of public service calls upon government employees and agencies to favor 
disclosure over concealment." 112 F.3d 910, 920 (8th Cir. 1997). 
A closer inspection of In re Grand Jury Subpoena reveals that it does not stand for the 
categorical rule that the work product doctrine is inapplicable in cases against public 
prosecutors. The statement on which Petitioners rely was made in the context of 
determining whether to recognize a previously undefined privilege: "whether an entity of 
the federal government may use the attorney-client privilege to avoid complying with a 
subpoena by a federal grand jury." Id. at 915 (emphasis added); see also id. at 921 ("We 
believe the strong public interest in honest government and in exposing p21] wrongdoing 
by public officials would be ill-served by recognition of a governmental attorney-client 
privilege applicable in criminal proceedings inquiring into the actions of public officials."). 
The Eighth Circuit did not purport to espouse a broad-ranging rule that defeated existing, 
well-defined privileges such as the work product doctrine. This is important, as the 
Supreme Court has recognized that the "work-product doctrine is distinct from and broader 
than the attorney-client privilege." United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238, 95 S. Ct. 
2160, 45 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975) (citing Hickman, 329 U.S. at 508). In fact, the Eighth Circuit 
went on to consider the application of the work product doctrine and concluded that it did 
not apply because the materials in question were not prepared in "anticipation of litigation." 
112 F.3d at 924-25. It did not find the work product doctrine wholly inapplicable based on a 
goal of public disclosure. 
In light of the well-established bounds of the work product doctrine--which grants public 
prosecutors "near absolute immunity" over their mental impressions in subsequent civil 
litigation--the Court finds that the CVRA's mandate that prosecutors make their "best 
efforts" to accord crime victims their rights does not create a "very rare and extraordinary 
circumstance" in which [1'22] discovery of protected work product would be allowed. See 
Cox, 17 F.3d at 1422. 
Second, Petitioners argue that the work product doctrine does not apply because the 
conduct of the Government's attorneys is a "central issue" in this case. (Id. at 15). Some 
lower courts have held that disclosure of opinion work product is "justified principally where 
the material is directly at issue, particularly if the lawyer or law firm is a party to the 
litigation." 8 Wright, Miller & Marcus, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P. § 2026, p. 567 & n.19 (3d ed. 
2010) (collecting cases). To satisfy this showing, however, the party seeking disclosure of 
opinion work product must make "a far stronger showing of necessity and unavailability by 
other means" than is needed to justify discovery of fact-based work product. Id. (quoting
