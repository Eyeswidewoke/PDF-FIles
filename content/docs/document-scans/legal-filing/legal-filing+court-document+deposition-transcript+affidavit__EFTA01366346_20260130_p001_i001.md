out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target 
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a 
quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor. officers. directors or our or their affiliates and will 
determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the 
reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 
As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us $225,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses 
of this offering. These loans am non-interest bearing. unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2015 
or the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the estimated 
$750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses. 
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. 
our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers, directors and director nominees may. but arc 
not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would 
repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion 
of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust 
account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of 
the post business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would 
be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holder. The terms of such loans by our officers. 
directors and director nominees, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to 
such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we

do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to 
seek access to funds in our trust account. 
Our sponsor has committed to purchase an aggregate of 11,600,000 (or 12,815,000 if the underwriters' over-
allotment option is exercised in full) private placement warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant ($5,800,000 in the 
aggregate or $6,407,5(X) if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that 
will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to 
purchase one-half of one share of our common stock at $5.75 per share. Our sponsor will be permitted to transfer 
the private placement warrants held by them to certain permitted transferees. including our executive officers and 
directors and other persons or entities affiliated with or related to them, but the transferees receiving such 
securities will be subject to the same agreements with respect to such securities as the sponsor. Otherwise, these 
warrants will not, subject to certain limited exceptions. be transferable or salable until 30 days after the completion 
of our business combination. The private placement warrants will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by 
our sponsor or its permitted transferees (except as described below under "Principal Stockholders—Transfers of 
Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants."). The private placement warrants may also be exercised by the 
sponsor or its permitted transferees for cash or on a cashless basis. Othenvise. the private placement warrants have 
terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering. 
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement we will enter into with our initial stockholder and the initial 
purchasers of the private placement warrants on or prior to the closing of this offering. we may be required to 
register certain securities for sale under the Securities Act. These holders arc entitled under the registration rights 
agreement to make up to three demands that we register certain of our securities held by them for sale under the 
Securities Act and to have the securities covered thereby registered for resale pursuant to Rule 415 under the 
Securities Act. In addition, these holders have the right to include their securities in other registration statements 
filed by us. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit a registration statement 
filed under the Securities Act to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-
up restrictions, as described herein. We will bear the costs and expenses of filing any such registration statements.
