UK Automatic Exchange of Information and the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) 
Appendix 2 Instructions 
Section A—General 
1. 
1.1k coiar Intergovernmental Agreements CA FATCA) 
The Crown Dependencies (hate of Man. Guernsey and Jersey) and the British Overseas Territories (the Cayman Islands, the Bntish Virgin 
Islands. Bermuda, Anguilla, Turks and Caicos Islands. Montserrat and Gibraltar) have all agreed to enter into automatic tax information 
exchange agreements with the UK. 
The agreements signed by the Crown Dependencies and Gibraltar With the UK are reciprocal, meaning that UK Financial Institutions will 
have to provide data on financial accounts held by tax residents of those territories to HM Revenue & Customs (1-IMFtC), who will then 
exchange the information with the respective tax authorities. The UK has implemented regulations and guidance to implement these 
arrangements. Financial Institutions resident In the Crown Dependencies and Gibraltar will be required to provide information on financial 
accounts held by UK tax residents.

Common Reporting Standard (CRS) 
On 20 July, 2013, the 020 leaders endorsed the OECD proposals for a global model of automatic information exchange as the expected 
new standard on Information exchange. This directive was carried out on 13 February, 2014, when the OECD released the Common 
Reporting Standard ('CRS') and model Competent Authority Agreement ('CAA`). On 15 Juty, 2014, the Council of the OECD published its 
detailed commentary on both the CRS and Model CAA 
In order to promote adoption of the Common Reporting Standard within the European Union, a revised Directive on Administrative 
Cooperation ("DAC') was published on 09 December, 2014 requiring EU Member States to begin the automatic exchange of information 
under the revised DAC no later than end of September 2017, which will be in line with other OECD 'Earlier Adopter' [centres. Per the DAC, 
the deadline for Member States to adopt local legislation will be 31 December. 2015. with the revised DAC *go-live' date commencing on 01 
January. 2016. As of 17 June, 2015, more than 90 countries and jurisdictions have signed up for the CRS, including at least 50 who have 
committed to be a part of the early adopter group, which phases in beginning 01 January, 2016. It is expected that more countries will opt to 
implement the standard as the initial go-live date approaches. 
CRS introduces requirements on top of other global and local implementation programs (e.g. FATCA, EUSD, Of) aiming at a uniform global 
standard of information exchange. Both the Model CM and CRS each have a foundation that is substantially similar to that of the MICA 
Intergovernmental Agreements (fGets), with subtle differences imposed by the OECD and influenced through local taw. Just as With FATCA, 
the CRS therefore impose obligations on Financial Institutions resident in those territories to report Information on financial accounts held by 
foreign tax residents to the local tax authorities.
