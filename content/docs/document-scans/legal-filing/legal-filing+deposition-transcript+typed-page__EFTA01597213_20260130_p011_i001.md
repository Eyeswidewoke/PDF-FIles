Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer Services 
Many UBS accounts incorporate the Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer services. If 
you enroll in these services, you authorize UBS and its processing bank to effect the types 
of transactions described in the Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer Service 
Agreement. This service agreement also applies to other electronic transfers to or from 
your Accounts, including transfers made with UBS CashConnect feature and certain 
payments made through the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") system, even if you do 
not enroll in this service. 
UBS Visa Debit Card for RMA or BSA 
Brokerage accounts with cash management features include the UBS Visa Debit Card 
(Card). If you choose this feature either verbally or in writing, you will be issued one or 
more Card(s) by the Card Issuer. UBS or the Card Issuer will complete any transactions you 
initiate using the Card(s). The Card Issuer will approve transactions up to your account's 
"Withdrawal Limit," as described in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. 
You agree to maintain sufficient available assets in your account to make payment in full, 
and transactions may be denied if there are insufficient assets in your account to make full 
payment for any Card transactions as they are processed. As your Card cash withdrawals 
are processed, we will deduct funds from your Account to reimburse the Card Issuer. Once 
each calendar month, we will deduct from your Account the amount of purchases made 
with the Card that have been received by the Card Issuer but not yet deducted from your 
Account. The Card Issuer may suspend or cancel Cards if there are insufficient assets to 
cover transactions. Your use of the Card constitutes your agreement to the terms and 
conditions in the UBS Visa Debit Card Cardholder Agreement, which is included in the 
Agreements and Disclosures booklet. 
UBS Credit Card for RMA or BSA 
You may apply for a UBS Visa Signature credit card or UBS Preferred Visa Signature credit 
card (Credit Card) either verbally or in writing. If your application is approved by the Card 
Issuer, you will be issued one or more Credit Cards. We will bill transactions made with 
your Credit Card separately from your eligible brokerage account. You may pay your 
Credit Card balance automatically each month from your eligible brokerage account, or 
you may pay the bill from other sources or allow a balance to revolve. The Credit Card 
terms and conditions describes rates, fees and other costs for the Credit Card. The Card 
Issuer will issue and manage your Credit Card according to Utah law and the UBS Credit 
Card Cardholder agreement (Credit Card Agreement). The Card Issuer will include the 
Credit Card Agreement with your Credit Card. 
Your use of the Credit Card constitutes your agreement to the terms and conditions in the 
Credit Card Agreement, which may change occasionally. The Credit Card is not subject to 
the General Terms and Conditions of this UBS Client Relationship Agreement. To fulfill 
your application for a Credit Card, we will share the personal information the Card Issuer 
requires to open your Credit Card Account, and we share your personal information such 
as application data, approval status and transaction information on a regular basis to 
update your UBS monthly account statement and our records. 
When you request a Credit Card, the Card Issuer will obtain a credit report as part of your 
application and after it establishes your Credit Card account to administer your Credit Card 
account and report its credit experience with you to others. At your request, the Card 
Issuer will provide the name and address of each consumer reporting agency from which it 
obtained a report about you. After your Credit Card account is open, you will have the 
opportunity to select how the Card Issuer can use or share information about you for 
marketing or Credit Card account maintenance purposes. 
Any disputes you may have with the Card Issuer will be resolved by binding Arbitration. For 
more information regarding Arbitration please consult the UBS Credit Card Agreement.
