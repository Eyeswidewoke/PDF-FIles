or subconscious, bias into the hiring process. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2548. To that 
end, the plaintiffs' expert testified the company was "vulnerable" to "gender bias." Id. at 
2553. The Court, however, concluded that the expert could not with specificity determine 
how the culture concretely influenced individual employment decisions. Id. at 2553-54. The 
testimony was therefore insufficient to show a common policy that produced a common 
injury. 
Here, however, the workers have provided substantial evidence of unadulterated, 
consciously articulated, odious racism throughout the Nucor plant, including affirmative 
[""41] actions by supervisors and a widespread attitude of permissiveness of racial 
hostility. The examples in the record are ubiquitous: bigoted epithets and monkey noises 
broadcast across the plant radio system, emails with highly offensive images sent to black 
workers, a hangman's noose prominently displayed, a white supervisor stating that 
"niggers aren't smart enough" to break production records, and abundant racist graffiti in 
locker rooms and shared spaces. Moreover, no more than one black supervisor worked in 
the Nucor production departments until after the EEOC charge that preceded this litigation. 
It strains the intellect to posit an equitable promotions system set against that cultural 
backdrop, particularly in light of the other evidence presented. 
The dissent rejects the idea that evidence of a racially hostile work environment may help 
establish a claim for disparate treatment in promotions decisions." Post at 124-25. Indeed, 
the dissent goes so far as to observe that "locker rooms and radios bear no relationship to 
promotions decisions." Id. at 125. Such a perspective, however, is perplexingly divorced 
from reality and the history of workplace discrimination. [1-1N19] It is difficult to fathom how 
widespread [""42] racial animus of the type alleged here, an animus that consistently 
emphasized the inferiority of black workers, bears no relationship to decisions whether or 
not to promote an employee of that race. Although the dissent asserts that "nothing in the 
record supports" making a connection between the work environment and promotions 
practices, we are not limited to the record in making such elementary judgments. Justice is 
not blind to history, and we need not avert our eyes from the broader circumstances 
surrounding employment decisions, and the inferences that naturally follow. 
17 We do not suggest. of course. that evidence of a hostile work environment is sufficient by itself to support a disparate 
treatment or disparate impact claim. Rather, we merely observe that the substantial showing of endemic prejudice at the plant --
a prejudice that was allegedly tolerated and/or encouraged by management - heightens the probativeness of the workers' other 
evidence.

Third, and related, the anecdotal evidence of discrimination in this case is substantially 
more probative than that in Wal-Mart. The Wal-Mart plaintiffs presented affidavits from 
about 120 female employees, representing approximately ["43] one affidavit for every 
12,500 class members. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2556. The affidavits captured only 235 of 
Wal-Mart's 3,400 stores, and there were no affidavits p913] from workers in 14 states. Id. 
The evidence thus fell far short of the benchmark for a showing of company-wide 
discrimination established by Teamsters, 431 U.S. 324, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396. 
In Teamsters, the plaintiffs produced statistical evidence of racial bias combined with
