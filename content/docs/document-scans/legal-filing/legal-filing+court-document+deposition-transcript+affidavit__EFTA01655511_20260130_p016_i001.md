• Carnegie: The World at a Crossroads: Implications of Evolving Nuclear Security — Thursday, November 6, 
2025. Location: Online event, 12:30 PM. Over the past decade, the global nuclear security landscape has 
been reshaped by changes in nuclear capabilities, deterrence doctrines, and strategic alliances of the major 
nuclear powers. As the United States, Russia, and China have modernized and expanded their nuclear 
arsenals, escalating global conflict, from Ukraine to the Middle East, has shifted the traditional foundations 
of the nuclear order and deepened regional rivalries. With the U.S. reassessing its global interests under the 
second Trump administration and concerns of increased coordination between Russia, China, North Korea, 
and Iran growing, policymakers are changing the way they think about nuclear security. 
• CATO Institute: The Military Balance in the Indo-Pacific with and Without Taiwan — Thursday, November 6, 
2025. Location: Online event, 11:00 AM. The prospect of a Chinese invasion and conquest of Taiwan is a 
major focus of US—China security competition. Apart from its political, economic, and moral consequences, 
some US experts argue that Chinese control of Taiwan would compromise the US military position in Asia, 
bolstering the case that the United States should commit its military to defend Taiwan's autonomy. Jonathan 
Caverley and Evan Montgomery will discuss the stakes of the US commitment to Taiwan, whether preserving 
Taiwan's autonomy justifies risking conflict with China, and the relationship between Taiwan and the broader 
military balance in the Indo-Pacific. 
• PIIE: Bridges and borders: Economic  policy across North America — Thursday, November 6, 2025. Location: 
Online event, 9:00 AM. This conference organized by PIIE and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas examines 
key policy and economic challenges shaping the future of North American integration, with a focus on labor 
mobility, remittance flows, and cross-border trade. As the region navigates shifting immigration dynamics 
and prepares for a pivotal review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2026, conference 
sessions explore how policy decisions affect economic resilience, productivity, and regional cooperation. 
Experts assess the implications for workers, firms, and communities and consider strategies for 
strengthening economic ties across borders.
