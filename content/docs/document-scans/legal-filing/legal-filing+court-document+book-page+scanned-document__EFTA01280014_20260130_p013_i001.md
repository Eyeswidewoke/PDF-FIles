Borrower's notice address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice 
to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the 
Property Address unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. 
Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower's change of address. If Lender specifies a

mailing it by first class mail to Lender's address stated herein unless Lender has designated another 
address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument shall not be 
deemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender. If any notice required by

satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument. 
16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be 
governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights 
and obligations contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations 
of Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by 
contract or it might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against 
agreement by contract. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the 
Note conflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security 
Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision.

limited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment 
sales contract or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future 
date to a purchaser. 
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower 
is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's 
prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this 
Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is 
prohibited by Applicable Law. 
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall 
provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 
15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails 
to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period. Lender may invoke any remedies permitted 
by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.
