money market fund. Money market funds are sold by prospectus, which includes

Automatic Exchanges of Certain Sweep Funds 
Different Sweep Funds may be offered to dients who have Marketing Relationship assets with 
UBS of $25 million or more or who otherwise meet requirements established by UBS in its sole 
discretion. If you meet this asset threshold and own shares of the UBS RMA Government 
Money Market Fund through any of the UBS sweep programs, you will become eligible for the 
UBS Select Government Capital Fund and we will liquidate your shares in the UBS RMA 
Government Money Market Fund and purchase shares in the UBS Select Government Capital 
Fund without direction from, or prior notice to, you. Thereafter, the UBS Select Government 
Capital Fund will be your Sweep Option (or Secondary Sweep Option, as the case may be). 
Once a first purchase has been made into the fund, the UBS Select Government Capital Fund 
will remain your Sweep Option (or Secondary Sweep Option) even if your Marketing 
Relationship assets cease to meet the minimum asset thresholds for the UBS Select 
Government Capital Fund. 
Your eligibility for the UBS Select Government Capital Fund will be determined at the end of 
each month, based on the value of your Marketing Relationship assets as determined in the 
sole discretion of UBS. If the value of your Marketing Relationship assets reaches the minimum 
asset threshold at any time other than the end of the month, you will not be eligible for the 
UBS Select Government Capital Fund. 
The Puerto Rico Fund 
The Puerto Rico Fund is offered as a Sweep Option (and Secondary Sweep Option) exclusively 
to residents of Puerto Rico as defined in that fund's prospectus and is not available as a Sweep 
Option for tax•deferred accounts such as IRAs and Plans and Participants. The Puerto Rico 
Fund is not a money market fund registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act 
of 1940, as amended, does not comply with rules applicable to U.S. registered funds 
and presents a higher degree of risk than those funds. The Puerto Rico Fund is not 
FDIC insured, may lose value and has no bank guarantee. The Puerto Rico Fund is sold 
by prospectus only, which may be found at 
www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth/miscipuertoricofunds or from your Financial Advisor. 
Margin Agreement and Margin Requirements 
All Accounts that you open now or in the future will be established with margin, if eligible, 
unless you instruct us that you do not want margin privileges for specific Accounts. By signing 
the Signature Page for any Account except for an ERISA Plan, you agree that the Margin 
Agreement governs your use of margin in all of your current Accounts and any eligible 
Accounts that you may open in the future. 
Therefore, if you do not establish margin privileges when you open an Account and later 
decide to use margin, you may be able to do so without signing additional forms. Likewise, if 
you cancel your margin privileges on an Account, your Margin Agreement with us will remain 
in effect and you may request to use margin again at any time. In either event, we will confirm 
your request. 
When you use your margin privileges, we hold your securities in your Account as collateral 
against the amounts you borrow, and your securities may be loaned to UBS or to others as 
described in the Margin Agreement. In addition, margin•eligible Accounts are subject to 
applicable statutes, rules, regulations, procedures or industry customs. We may deem it 
necessary or advisable to establish additional requirements for margin accounts. You agree to 
maintain sufficient assets to satisfy all applicable statutes, rules or regulations, or as we deem
