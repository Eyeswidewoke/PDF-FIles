Epstein's house arrest challenges guidelines; Many departures from state regulations OK'd 
by court or probation officer. Palm Beach Daily News July 4, 2010 Sunday 
Epstein, 57, has traveled on his private jet multiple times each month to the Virgin Islands 
or New York, all in compliance with a court order. 
He has spent blocks of time in Home Depot and Sports Authority multiple times, as 
documented in his daily probation logs. 
On March 31, he was at Home Depot from 6 to 10 p.m., according to his daily probation 
logs; and on March 27, Epstein notes that he was at both stores from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
"By statute, stores are not prohibited places for sex offenders," said Jo Ellyn Rackleff, 
spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections in Tallahassee. "Community 
Control procedures allow for offenders to be given permission to shop for personal needs 
for reasonable amounts of time." 
But Assistant State Attorney Teri Skiles, chief of the Major Violent Crimes Division, said 
other than going to work, Epstein is allowed to "go to the grocery store once a week, his 
attorney's office and any doctors' appointments. However, he has to advise his probation 
officer of all of his appointments prior to going." 
Regarding shopping, Skiles said it is not the intention of the state attorney's office to allow 
it. 
"However, if he gets permission from his probation officer, then he is allowed to," she said. 
Florida Department of Corrections guidelines state: "Shopping for personal items and 
getting a haircut is limited to once a month." 
Epstein served 13 months of his 18-month sentence and received liberal work-release 
privileges while in jail. He was able to go to his West Palm Beach office six days a week 
for up to 16 hours a day. 
Epstein has been serving one year of house arrest at his Palm Beach home, which ends 
July 21, and is registered as a lifelong sex offender. 
Epstein has paid confidential settlements to more than two dozen women locally who claim 
Epstein sexually abused them as minors. Jane Doe, who was 14 at the time of the abuse, 
is set for trial in her case on July 19. 
Probation officer gives permission 
Epstein's daily probation logs are supposed to detail -- with addresses included -- his 
whereabouts at all times, according to Florida Department of Corrections guidelines. In 
most cases, Epstein's logs are short on details, usually with no specific addresses and, in 
one case, inaccurate. 
The Aug. 19, 2009, entry shows he was at the "office" at 250 S. Australian Ave., West 
Palm Beach, from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. But, according to a Palm Beach Police memorandum, 
Epstein was stopped by Palm Beach Police Capt. George Frick walking back and forth 
along South Ocean Boulevard between 4:30 and 5 p.m. that day, one month after his 
release from the Palm Beach County Jail. 
When Frick stopped Epstein at 4:53 p.m., he was walking southbound at South Ocean at 
Clarke Avenue but he had been seen walking northbound a half-hour earlier, according to 
the written report.
