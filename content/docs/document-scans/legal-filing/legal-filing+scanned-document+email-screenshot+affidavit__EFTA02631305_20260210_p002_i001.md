Due to Trump's anti-science policies and budget cuts, scientists are=20 looking towards private donors for funding. 
Philanthropic dollars have now come to play an important role in scientific progress. 
The successful American financier and philanthropist, Jeffery Epstein, is well known for supporting science; he is 
currently taking action to help a number of scientists thrive during the "Trump Era." 
=/div> 
None of this is new for Jeffery, though. Jeffery's fundin= for science dates back to the year 2000, when he founded the 
<https://www.jeffreyepstein.org/Jeffrey_Epstein.html> Jeffery Epstein VI foundation to support cutting-edge science 
and science education around the world. The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation has supported many leading scientists 
including Stephen Hawkings, Martin Nowak, Gregory Benford, Lee Smolin, Seth Lloyd, Lawrence Krauss, Artificial 
Intelligence scientist, Marvin Minsky and Nobel Laureates Gerard 't Hooft, David Gross and Frank=20 Wilczek. 
In 2003, the Foundation established the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics<=a> at Harvard University, providing a $35 
million gift to the university. The program is one of the first to study the evolution of molecular biology with the primary 
use of mathematics. It also became one of the first departments to develop a mathematical model to show how cancer 
cells evolve as infectious bacteria and viruses such as HIV. <https://ped.fas.harvard.edu/>

While Jeffrey has donated large sums of money to help find a cure for cancer and infectious diseases, President Trump's 
proposed budget seeks an=$82 million cut for the center that works on vaccine-preventable and respiratory diseases, 
such as influenza and measles. 
Trump's budget also proposes a cut of $186 million from programs at CDC's=20 center on HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, 
sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis prevention. One of the biggest cuts, however, is $222 million for the 
agency's chronic disease prevention programs, which=are designed to help people prevent diabetes, heart disease and 
stroke, and obesity. 
"I have helped scientists for 20 years and I don't really believe tha= you can say you fully understand a particular 
problem, unless your ideas can be tested against solid evidence," Jeffery said. "But t= tackle those problem you need 
resources, and if you have them the results can be marvellous. For example, in one simple and elegant equation, 
mathematics managed to describe the whole motion of the planets that alluded men for ages." 
A Helping Hand Goes A Long Way 
Private donors who help fund science-based research and projects, such as Jeffery, are making a huge difference. When 
federal dollars become tight, the donors who step in become the real heroes. And while private funds are not usually as 
large as federal funds, these donations can go a long way in terms of finding cures for diseases. 
For example, HIV/AIDS was once viewed as a death sentence in the 1980s, but years of privately-funded research have 
helped scientists understand the basic biology of viruses and the workings on DNA. The Program for Evolutionary 
Dynamics, funded by Jeffery, is now conducting research in mapping colon cancer resistance to inhibitor drugs, mapping 
the progression of pancreatic cancer, targeting the topology of minority mutations that drive tumor growth and creating 
a database to predict and minimize resistance to HIV drugs.
