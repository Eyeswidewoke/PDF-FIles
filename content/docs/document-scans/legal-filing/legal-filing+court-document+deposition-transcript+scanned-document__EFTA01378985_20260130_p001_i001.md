United States Federal Tax Considerations 
This discussion supplements and, to the extent inconsistent therewith, supersedes the discussion in the accompanying product 
supplement under 'Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations." 
Due to the lack of any controlling legal authority, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of 
an investment in the securities. In the opinion of our counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, it is reasonable under current law to 
treat the securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid financial contracts with associated coupons that will be 
treated as gross income to you at the time received or accrued in accordance with your regular method of tax accounting. 
However, our counsel has advised us that it is unable to conclude affirmatively that this treatment is more likely than not to be 
upheld, and that alternative treatments are possible that could materially affect the timing and character of income or loss you 
recognize on the securities. Moreover, our counsel's opinion is based on market conditions as of the date of this preliminary 
pricing supplement and is subject to confirmation on the Trade Date. 
Assuming this treatment of the securities is respected and subject to the discussion in "Material United States Federal Income 
Tax Considerations" in the accompanying product supplement, the following U.S. federal income tax consequences should 
result: 
• 
Any coupons paid on the securities should be taxable as ordinary income to you at the time received or accrued in 
accordance with your regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
• 
Upon a sale or other disposition (including retirement) of a security, you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the 
difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in the security. For this purpose, the amount realized does not 
include any coupon paid on retirement and may not include sale proceeds attributable to an accrued coupon, which may be 
treated as a coupon payment. Such gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss if you held the security for more 
than one year. 
We do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the treatment of the securities, and the IRS or a court might not 
agree with the treatment described herein. In particular, the securities might be determined to be contingent payment debt 
instruments, in which case the tax consequences of ownership and disposition of the securities, including the timing and 
character of income recognized, might be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the U.S. Treasury Department and the 
IRS have requested comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of "prepaid forward 
contracts" and similar financial instruments and have indicated that such transactions may be the subject of future regulations 
or other guidance. In addition, members of Congress have proposed legislative changes to the tax treatment of derivative 
contracts. Any legislation, Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could 
materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You 
should consult your tax advisor regarding possible alternative tax treatments of the securities and potential changes in 
applicable law. 
Non-U.S. Holders.The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the coupons is unclear. Except as provided below and in the 
accompanying product supplement under -Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Securities Held 
Through Foreign Entities" and "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Non-U.S. Holders Generally—
Substitute Dividend and Dividend Equivalent Payments," we currently do not intend to treat coupons paid to a Non-U.S. Holder 
(as defined in the accompanying product supplement) of the securities as subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, provided that 
the Non-U.S. Holder complies with applicable certification requirements. However, it is possible that the IRS could assert that 
such payments are subject to U.S. withholding tax, or that we or another withholding agent may otherwise determine that 
withholding is required, in which case we or the other withholding agent may withhold at a rate of up to 30% on such payments. 
Moreover, as discussed under "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Non-U.S. Holders Generally—
Substitute Dividend and Dividend Equivalent Payments" in the accompanying product supplement, Section 871(m) of the 
Internal Revenue Code generally imposes a 30% withholding tax on "dividend equivalents" paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. 
Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to U.S. equities or indices that include U.S. equities. Treasury 
regulations under Section 871(m), as modified by an IRS notice, exclude from their scope financial instruments issued prior to 
January 1, 2021 that do not have a "delta" of one with respect to any U.S. equity. Based on the terms of the securities and 
representations provided by us as of the date of this preliminary pricing supplement, our counsel is of the opinion that the 
securities should not be treated as transactions that have a "delta" of one within the meaning of the regulations with respect to 
any U.S. equity and, therefore, should not be subject to withholding tax under Section 871(m). However, the final determination 
regarding the treatment of the securities under Section 871(m) will be made as of the Trade Date for the securities and it is 
possible that the securities will be subject to withholding tax under Section 871(m) based on circumstances on that date. 
A determination that the securities are not subject to Section 871(m) is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with 
this determination. Moreover, Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, 
including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to a U.S. equity to which the securities relate. You should 
consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the securities. 
We will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to U.S. federal withholding taxes.
