Throughout recent history there have been innumerable approaches to modernizing cities and towns (as defined 
by Western standards) in the developing world where there exist none of the infrastructure created over the past 
100 years. The infrastructure of a modern city includes water, sewage, healthcare, housing, transportation, power, 
communications, safety, waste disposal, and more—all the things we tend to describe as necessities or essentials 
to just living. Yet across the developing world, these don't exist and the approaches to bringing them have seen 
mixed results throughout the latter part of the 201b century. 
The challenges are immense. The skills and resources required are immense. The organizational and cultural issues 
to overcome are immense. We are all familiar with the hundreds of billions of dollars that the developed countries 
of the world have provided in direct and in-kind aid and yet the situation remains much as it has been for 50 years. 
Upon mention of the country of Ethiopia, many of us remember the famine (caused by a combination of 
environmental and governmental problems) that took the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in just a couple 
of years. A country of over 80 million people, of whom about 80% rely on subsistence farming to live, represents 
the challenges of building cities from scratch. Standard statistics such as a GDP per person of about 350 routinely 
place Ethiopia among the poorest in the world, and those basic services described above exist in few places in the 
entire country. 
In addition, there are cultural or societal issues involved. Certainly international organizations have come to cities 
and built homes, some roads, or put in water or electrical. But this infrastructure seems to decay rapidly and 
almost always seems "wrong" to the citizens. These attempts at providing services simply "appeared" without the 
involvement of citizens and absent tradeoffs among choices, just seemed wrong (no matter how well intentioned) 
and thus a legacy of failed projects across developing countries. A common cultural misunderstanding might be the 
rush to bring flush toilets (sewage) to cities that don't have enough water. Another example, might be the efforts 
to build housing using Western ideals of materials and floor plans without a clear understanding of usage patterns 
and the climate. 
In Ethiopia, there are at least 10 cities with a permanent population of over 100,000 people (census data in 
Ethiopia is not so great through for a variety of reasons). Visiting these cities shows little in the way of clean water, 
sewage, paved roads, stable structures, electricity, city planning, etc. Where do you start? How can you bring all of 
these modern infrastructure services to a city? Think about it—you can't do construction without roads, but you 
can't build roads without asphalt which require heavy machinery and petroleum, and you don't want to put all of 
these in without a plan for how the city should evolve. These questions and attempts at answers have stumped 
urban planners for decades. There's a cycle of dependencies where you can't seem to find the starting point. 
What's the platform upon which you build a city? 
In technology, a platform is something that provides two (at least) important elements: 
• 
It is a technology that immediately solves problems faced by a significant number of constituents 
• 
It is a technology that is part of a self-reinforcing cycle or ecosystem that gets stronger the more people 
use it for what it is intended 
There are many technology platforms. We're all familiar with Windows and the services it provides that turn raw 
hardware into a functional PC—the combination of hardware and software creates tool that begets more tools, 
solves more problems, and creates more economic value for an increasingly large group of people. The web is 
certainly a platform in the combination of protocols and formats. Excel is a platform for financially minded people. 
Photoshop and the formats it supports is a platform for graphics professionals. AutoCAD is a platform for 
architects and engineers.
