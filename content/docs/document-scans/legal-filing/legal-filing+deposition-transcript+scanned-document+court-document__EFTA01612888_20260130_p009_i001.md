6.2 
Machine Learning 
With the rapid improvement in computational power and machine learning algorithms, blockchain technol-
ogy can help facilitate a mechanism to compensate an Artificial Intelligence (AI) service provider for the 
development and execution of novel machine learning algorithms. For example, developing machine learning 
algorithms that can look at a radiology image or CT scan and make diagnosis predictions are time con-
sinning to develop, but once developed are easy to execute. By leveraging blockchain technology, one can 
envision a world in which a service provider publishes FHIR DiagnosticReports of radiology images to the 
blockchain. An AI service provider that specializes in developing novel machine learning algorithms with 
which the hospital has partnerships would be allowed to rim their algorithm over the images and publish 
the Al diagnosis output back to the blockchain. 
The radiologist at the hospital could then use this result as an independent reference to compare his or 
her own diagnosis. The AI providers get compensated when their diagnosis matches that of the radiologist, 
so there is an incentive for the AI providers to refine and keep improving the accuracy of their algorithms. 
The blockchain also provides an irrefutable trail of what the AI provider diagnosed and the final official 
diagnosis.
