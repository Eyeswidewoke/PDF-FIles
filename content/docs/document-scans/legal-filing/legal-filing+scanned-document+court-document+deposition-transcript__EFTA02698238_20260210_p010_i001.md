Additional Key Holders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained 
herein, if the Company shall issue additional shares of its Common Stock after the date hereof, 
pursuant to an equity incentive plan or otherwise, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause, 
with respect to future issuances of Common Stock and future grants of options to purchase 
shares of the Company's Common Stock of more than one percent (1%) of the Company's then-
outstanding shares of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis assuming conversion of all then-
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock), as a condition to such issuance, any such holder of such 
shares of Common Stock (an "Additional Holder") to become a party to this Agreement by 
executing and delivering an additional counterpart signature page to this Agreement and such 
holder shall be deemed a "Key Holder" and a party hereunder. This Agreement, including 
without limitation, Exhibit A hereto, may be amended by the Company without the consent of 
the Key Holders or the Investors to add such Additional Holders as signatories hereto. 
3.11 
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, 
each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one 
instrument. 
3.12 
Waiver. No waivers of any breach of this Agreement extended by any party 
hereto to any other party shall be construed as a waiver of any rights or remedies of any other 
party hereto or with respect to any subsequent breach.

Delays or Omissions. It is agreed that no delay or omission to exercise any right, 
power or remedy accruing to any party, upon any breach, default or noncompliance by another 
party under this Agreement shall impair any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be 
construed to be a waiver of any such breach, default or noncompliance, or any acquiescence 
therein, or of or in any similar breach, default or noncompliance thereafter occurring. It is 
further agreed that any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on any 
party's part of any breach, default or noncompliance under this Agreement or any waiver on such 
party's part of any provisions or conditions of the Agreement must be in writing and shall be 
effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies, either under this 
Agreement by law, or otherwise afforded to any party, shall be cumulative and not alternative.

to this Agreement, including without limitation, such reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys 
and accountants, which shall include, without limitation, all fees, costs and expenses of appeals.
