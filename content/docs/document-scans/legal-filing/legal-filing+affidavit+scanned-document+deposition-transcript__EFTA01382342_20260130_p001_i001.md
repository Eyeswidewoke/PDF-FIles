Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
In the second quarter of 2014, Safeway received two subpoenas from the DEA concerning its record keeping, reporting and 
related practices associated with the loss or theft of controlled substances. We are not a party to any pending DEA administrative or 
judicial proceeding arising from or related to these subpoenas. We are cooperating with the DEA in all investigative matters. 
In June 2014, Albertson's LLC agreed to settle a California civil enforcement action involving allegations of illegal disposal, 
storage, reverse logistic transportation and mismanagement of hazardous waste in violation of the California Hazardous Waste Control 
laws. Albertson's LLC did not admit fault or liability in the settlement agreement and agreed to pay 83.4 million, which includes civil 
penalties, the cost of the investigation and funding for supplemental environmental projects in California. As part of the settlement, 
Albertson's LLC also agreed to implement an improved retail hazardous product waste program, to create new, enhanced compliance 
programs and to provide an annual status report to the specified agencies for five years. The settlement pertains to all Albertson's LLC 
retail and warehouse facilities in California. 
In January 2015, Safeway Inc. agreed to settle a California enforcement action involving allegations of illegal disposal, storage, 
reverse logistic transportation and mismanagement of hazardous waste in violation of the California Hazardous Waste Control laws. 
Safeway did not admit fault or liability in the settlement agreement and agreed to pay $9.9 million, which includes civil penalties, the cost 
of investigation and funding for supplemental environmental projects in California. As part of the settlement, Safeway also agreed to 
continue certain compliance activities with respect to both potential hazardous waste and private health information and to provide an 
annual status report to the specified agencies for five years. The settlement pertains to all Safeway retail and warehouse facilities in 
California. 
On August 14, 2014, we announced that we had experienced a criminal intrusion by installation of malware on a portion of our 
computer network that processes payment card transactions for retail store locations for our Shaw's. Star Market, Acme, Jewel-Osco 
and Albertsons retail banners. On September 29, 2014, we announced that we had experienced a second and separate criminal 
intrusion. We believe these were attempts to collect payment card data. Relying on our IT service provider, SuperValu, we took 
immediate steps to secure the affected part of the network. We believe that we have eradicated the malware used in each intrusion. We 
notified federal law enforcement authorities, the major payment card networks, and our insurance carriers and are cooperating in their 
efforts to investigate these intrusions. As required by the payment card brands, we retained a firm to conduct a forensic investigation into 
the intrusions. The forensic firm has issued separate reports for each intrusion (copies of which have been provided to the card 
networks). Although our network had previously been found to be compliant with PCI DSS, in both reports the forensic firm found that not 
all of these standards had been met, and some of this non-compliance may have contributed to or caused at least some portion of the 
compromise that occurred during the intrusions. We believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us. 
These claims will likely include amounts for incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as 
card reissuance costs) that the payment card networks assert they or their issuing banks have incurred. If the payment card networks 
assert claims against us, we currently intend to dispute those claims and assert available defenses. At the present time, we cannot 
reasonably estimate a range of losses because to date no claims have yet been asserted and because significant factual and legal 
issues remain unresolved. We will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate of loss when it is 
both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Asa result of the criminal intrusions, two 
class action complaints were filed against us by consumers and are currently pending, Mertz v. SuperValu Inc. et at filed in federal court 
in the state of Minnesota and Rocke v. SuperValu Inc. et at filed in federal court in the state of Idaho, alleging deceptive trade practices, 
negligence and invasion of privacy. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has consolidated 
the class actions and transferred the cases to the District of
