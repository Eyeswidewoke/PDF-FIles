Former West Virginia Officers Sentenced to Decades in Prison for Their Role in Deadly Inmate Assault 
The Associated Press (07/09, Staff Writer) reported that two former West Virginia correctional officers were 
sentenced to decades in prison on Wednesday for their roles in an assault that resulted in the death of an 
inmate. Mark Holdren, 41, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Johnathan Walters, 33, was sentenced to 21 
years in prison for the March 2022 attack in the Southern Regional Jail, according to a press release from the 
Department of Justice. The article added that Quantez Burks, 37, was a pretrial detainee who died less than a day 
after he was booked into the jail in Beaver on a wanton endangerment charge, according to court documents. 
When Burks tried to push past an officer to leave his housing unit, he was taken to an interview room where he 
was handcuffed and restrained while officers including Holdren and Walters assaulted him. Burks was struck in the 
head multiple times, kicked and pepper-sprayed, according to the Justice Department. After the assault, Burks 
became unresponsive, so officers including Walters carried him to a different pod. Walters swung Burks' head into 
a metal door to open it and the officers dropped his body onto a concrete cell floor. He was pronounced deceased 
a short time later by emergency medical personnel. A DOJ press release noted that the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office 
investigated the case. 
FBI Busts Chinese Nationals For Multi-Million Dollar Drug Ring, Exploiting Immigration System 
The Daily Wire (07/09, Mahieu) reported that the FBI busted a multi-million dollar marijuana trafficking scheme 
run by Chinese nationals, the Justice Department said Tuesday. Seven Chinese nationals were charged over an 
alleged marijuana conspiracy operating out of Massachusetts and Maine. Investigators said that the operation, 
which began in January 2020, generated millions of dollars by distributing kilogram-sized quantities of marijuana in 
bulk. Those charged are 39-year-old Jianxiong Chen, 36-year-old Yuxiong Wu, 38-year-old Dinghui Li, 35-year-old 
Dechao Ma, 35-year-old Peng Lian Zhu, 35-year-old Hongbin Wu, and 47-year-old Yanrong Zhu. Yanrong Zhu 
"remains a fugitive," while the others were all taken into federal custody, according to the DOJ. FBI agent Ted Docks 
said that Chen, who lived in Braintree, Massachusetts, a city about 12 miles south of Boston, smuggled Chinese 
nationals over the Mexican border and forced them to work at marijuana grow houses to pay off the smuggling 
fees and get their passports back. In the last several years, Chinese-backed marijuana operations have cropped up 
across the United States, and there have been major drug busts in states like New Mexico and Maine. In Maine 
alone, Border Patrol has reportedly identified at least 270 illegal marijuana grow operations that are worth billions 
of dollars. The Greenfield Recorder (07/09, Cammalleri) also reported on the story.

WHNT (CBS-19) (07/09, Teutsch) reported that the FBI said fraudsters are targeting U.S. stock investors at an 
increased rate in 2025 compared to previous years. The FBI posted a public service announcement on July 3,

online engagement, often via social media advertisements or messages promoting an 'investment club' of fellow

may present themselves as legitimate brokerage firms or well-known stock analysts.
