Now, as the Mail revealed this week, the Duchess, in an extraordinary move,=seems to have managed to sidestep the 
bankruptcy proceedings, which would =ave been an unsavoury diversion in royal wedding year, given that her two 
=aughters will be sitting on the family pews at Westminster Abbey on April =9. So just how has she done it? 
We understand that Fergie's creditors have be=n made an audacious offer of just 25 per cent in settlement of the 
money t=ey are owed - in other words, 25p in every pound. 
The offer was sent to them in letters and emails on behalf =f the hard-nosed City accountant Price WaterhouseCoopers, 
who were engaged=by Prince Andrew to get to grips with his ex-wife's finances. It s=t a deadline for acceptance of 
October 20 this year. 
What's more, it was conditional on all of the= accepting it. Indeed, the letter spelled out that in the event of there n=t 
being universal acceptance, the Duchess might have to recourse to an =80 individual voluntary arrangement' to pay 
what she can over a =eriod of five years. This could mean, the letter warned, that creditors mi=ht receive less than they 
were being offered now. 
The offer of a mere quarter of what they were owed di=mayed some creditors. In the event, most have accepted the 
deal, but two h=ve refused to settle. The amount they were owed is understood to total aro=nd £150,000, and this debt 
could still derail the entire process and =lunge Fergie back into bankruptcy proceedings. 
Ironically, the two dissenters, we have learned, were=not the swanky Mayfair lawyers Davenport Lyons (£204,000) or 
Selfridg=s in Oxford Street (£51,000) that featured high on the list of credit=rs — but are from among the Duchess's 
most intimate circle= One of them, we understand, is Kate Waddington, the Duchess's close=friend for nearly 20 years 
and her long-time public relations consultant u=til they parted company over the humiliating tabloid sting in which 
Fergie=attempted to sell access to 
Prince Andrew in exchange for £500,000. 
The other is Johnny O'Sullivan, a 42-year-old bachelor who worked f=r the Duchess as a personal assistant for 14 years 
until last year, and no= lives in the U.S. Like Ms Waddington, he counted the Duchess as a friend.=/div> 
Likely dissenter: Kate Waddington (left), who was Sarah Ferguson's clos=st friend for nearly 20 years Indeed, O'Sullivan 
was the person whom Fergie referred to when she =as filmed accepting a £27,000 down payment from the undercover 
newspa=er reporter posing as a businessman anxious to get alongside government tr=de envoy Andrew. When her 
desperate ploy was exposed, the Duchess explaine= she wanted the money to help O'Sullivan meet the fees for a 
postg=aduate course at a New York university he had enrolled on. 
What did not emerge at that time was that O'S=Ilivan was among Fergie's biggest private creditors. 
She is thought to have owed him more than £70,00., made up of unpaid salary and fees as well as cash, which he 
invested in =artmoor, the company she founded to control her business interests in the =S. and which folded with debts 
of £650,000. 
O'Sullivan refuses to talk about the matter, =ut according to friends he is 'very hurt' that he has been=offered so little, 
especially as the money he used to help Fergie'= business was his life savings.
