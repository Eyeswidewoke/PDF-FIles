Obligations that bear interest at a fixed rate other than Defaulted Obligations. Deferring PIK Obligations and Equity 
Securities, the weighted average coupon (expressed as a percentage) thereof obtained by (i) multiplying the 
Aggregate Principal Balance of each such Collateral Obligation by the current interest rate of such Collateral 
Obligation, as of such date. (ii) summing the amounts determined pursuant to clause (i). 
c
ilgg such sum by 
the Aggregate Principal Balance for all such Collateral Obligations and (iv) adding to such percentage, the fraction 
(expressed as percentage) obtained by dEldiigi (a) the Gross Excess Spread, if any, as of such date by (b) the

Obligation which bears interest at a rate based on LIBOR, the spread to LIBOR for such Collateral Obligation as of 
such date or (y) with respect to each such Collateral Obligation which does not bear interest at a rate based on 
LIBOR as of the relevant date, the current interest rate on such Collateral Obligation minus the LIBOR rate in effect 
as of such dale (or. if the documentation for such Collateral Obligation specifics a designated spread to LIBOR and 
such spread is less than such difference, such spread). (ii) summing the amounts determined pursuant to clause (i). 
(iii) dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balance for all such Collateral Obligations and (iv) adding to 
such percentage the fraction (expressed as a percentage) obtained by dividing (a) the Gross Excess Coupon, if any, 
as of such date by (b) the Aggregate Principal Balance for all such Collateral Obligations. With respect to each 
Collateral Obligation that is a Revolving Loan. the amount determined for purposes of clause (i) above will be the
