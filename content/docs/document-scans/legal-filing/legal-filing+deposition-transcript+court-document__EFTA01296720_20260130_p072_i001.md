2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87203, * 
Whether proceeding under Rule 6(e)(3) or the court's inherent authority, there are well 
settled guidelines for determining when grand jury secrecy may be broken. Id. at 1347. 
Specifically, the parties seeking disclosure must show: 
(1) that the material they rsi seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding": 
(2) "that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy'; and 
(3)1hat their request is structured to cover only material so needed." 
Id. at 1348 (citing Douglas Oil Co.,N.W., 441 U.S. 211, 222, 99 S. Ct. 1667, 60 L. Ed. 2d 
156 (1979)). These demanding standards apply even after the grand jury has concluded its 
operations. Id. The burden of demonstrating that the need for disclosure outweighs the 
need for secrecy rests on the party seeking disclosure. Id. "In order to carry this burden, 
the party seeking disclosure of grand jury material must show a compelling and 
particularized need for disclosure." Id. That is, "the private party must show circumstances 
had created certain difficulties peculiar to this case, which could be alleviated by access to 
specific grand jury materials, without doing disproportionate harm to the salutary purpose 
of secrecy embodied in the grand jury process." Id. at 1348-49 (internal quotation marks 
omitted) (emphasis in original). 
Accordingly, the grand jury proceedings at issue are "presumptively secret," see In re 
Subpoena to Testify, 864 F.2d 1559, 1562 (11th Cir. 1989), and Petitioners have the heavy 
burden of overcoming this presumption., Petitioners argue that they have met their burden 
in their response to Epstein's No] motion to uphold grand jury secrecy. (DE 271 at 3). 
2 Because the burden lies with Petitioners. Petitioners' argument that disclosure is appropriate because the Government "has 
not attempted to defend its invocation of grand jury secrecy" is of no moment. (DE 278 at 10) 
Regarding whether (1) grand jury materials are "needed to avoid a possible injustice" in 
this case, Petitioners argue that "an injustice may occur' if the materials are not disclosed 
to them. (DE 217 at 4). They argue that the possibility for injustice exists because this 
Court has already recognized that aspects of this case "must be considered in the 
historical factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the relevant prosecutorial 
authorities and the federal offense victims—including an assessment of the allegation of a 
deliberate conspiracy between Epstein and the federal prosecutors to keep the victims in 
the dark on the pendency of negotiations between Epstein and the federal authorities." 
(Id.) (quoting the Court's Order at DE 189 at 12 n.6). They also argue that injustice may 
result without the grand jury materials because the "critical starting point for the victims' 
case" is proof that the Government rig had an "extremely strong case against Epstein." 
(Id.). 
The Court concludes that Petitioners have not met their heavy burden of demonstrating a 
compelling and particularized need for the disclosure of grand jury materials pertaining to 
the investigation of Epstein. Materials that the Government presented in secrecy to a 
grand jury relative to a case against Epstein are not part of the "interface" that occurred 
between Epstein, prosecuting authorities, and the victims. As the Court has already 
explained, the harm in this case did not arise out of the Government's failure to secure a
