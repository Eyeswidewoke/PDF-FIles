• Carnegie: How Can Our World Rethink Climate Mobility? — Thursday, February 6, 2025. Location: Online 
event, 9:00 AM. The discourse around climate change and human movement tends toward the apocalyptic 
and dystopian. Headlines warn that floods, droughts, and other extreme natural disasters—and the resulting 
displacement of dispossessed people—are the new normal. But what if we create an entirely new, forward-
thinking framework around climate mobility, both domestic and international? How would we reconsider 
borders, rethink international aid and cooperation, and reimagine how communities welcome and absorb 
newcomers? Can we learn to see mobility as an act of dignity, and another form of adaptation that moves a 
species forward?

• Wilson Center: Russian Media in Exile Find Global Relevance — Thursday, February 6, 2025. Location: Online 
event, 12:00 PM. Putin's ability to sustain his disastrous war in Ukraine depends nearly as much on his 
shutting down Russian civil society and independent media as his maintaining the supply of soldiers and 
weapons. Over the past three years, most independent media have had to flee Russia and start anew 
abroad. Three years later, Russian independent media in exile are not just surviving: they are producing 
groundbreaking reporting, investigations, and analyses that are relevant not only for domestic Russian 
audiences but for American and global ones as well.
