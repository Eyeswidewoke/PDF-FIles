If the alien expresses a fear of return, the alien is supposed to be detained by the 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Bureau and interviewed by an USCIS 
asylum officer. The asylum officer then makes the "credible fear" determination of 
the alien's claim. Those found to have a "credible fear" are referred to an EOIR 
immigration judge, which places the asylum seeker on the defensive path to asylum.' 
EOIR reports that it completed 91% of the 50,017 expedited removal asylum cases 
in 180 days or less in FY2003. 
Miens Arriving by Sea. On November 13, 2002, the former INS published 
a notice clarifying that certain aliens arriving by sea who are not admitted or paroled 
are to be placed in expedited removal proceedings and detained (subject to 
humanitarian parole)'' This notice concluded that illegal mass migration by sea 
threatened national security because it diverts the Coast Guard and other resources 
from their homeland security duties. The Attorney General expanded on this 
rationale in his April 17, 2003, ruling that instructs EOIR immigration judges to 
consider "national security interests implicated by the encouragement of further 
unlawful mass migrations ..." in making bond determinations regarding release from 
detention of unauthorized migrants who arrive in "the United States by sea seeking 
to evade inspection." 
The case involved a Haitian who had come ashore in 
Biscayne Bay, Florida, on October 29, 2002, and had been released on bond by an 
immigration judge. The BIA had upheld his release, but the Attorney General 
vacated the BIA decision." 
Background Checks. All aliens seeking asylum are subject to multiple 
background checks in the terrorist, immigration, and law enforcement databases, 
notably the Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS).35 Those who enter the 
country legally on nonimmigrant visas are screened by the consular officers at the 
Department of State when they apply for a visa, and all foreign nationals are 
inspected by CBP officers at ports of entry?' Those who enter the country illegally

" IBIS is a broad system that interfaces with the FBI's National Crime Information Center 
(NCIC), the Treasury Department's Enforcement and Communications System (TECS II), 
the former INS's National Automated Immigration Lookout System (NAILS) and Non-
immigrant Information System (NUS) and the Department of State's Consular Consolidated 
Database (CCD), Consular Lookout And Support System (CLASS) and TIPOFF terrorist 
databases. Because of the numerous systems and databases that interface with IBIS, the 
system is able to obtain such information as whether an alien is admissible, an alien's 
criminal information, and whether an alien is wanted by law enforcement.
