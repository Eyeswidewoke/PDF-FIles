Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Chargos:We use the Average Daily 
Balance method to calculate Finance Charges on yourAccount. Under this method, we figure the Finance Charges on your 
Account by applying the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for each feature (such as 
Purchase Cash Advance andBalance Transfer features) of your Account (including current transactions). To get the
AverageDaly Balance for each feature, we 
take the booming balance for the feature each day (including unpaid 
ce
Finan 
Charges from previous billing periods), (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees (3) subtract any paymentscr 
credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also 
add an amount of interest equal to the previous day's dolly balance multiplied by the daily periodic rate 
for the feature. This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for 
the next day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the 
feature for the tilling period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average 
Daily Balance for the feature. For all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance 
will be considered to be zero if you paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the 
Payment Due Date shown on that statement. if you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number 
of days in the tilling period and the daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the Finance Charge 
assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge for the billing period 
is calculated by addng the Finance Charges assessed on all features of the Account. This method of calculating the 
Average Daily Balance end Finance Charge results in daily compounding of Finance Charges. The minimum 
Finance Charge for any baling period in which Finance Charges are imposed is $0.50.
