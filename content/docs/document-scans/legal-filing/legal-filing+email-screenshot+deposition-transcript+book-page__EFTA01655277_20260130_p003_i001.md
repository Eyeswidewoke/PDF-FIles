IN THE NEWS 
FBI Reportedly Seizes 900 Pounds of Meth in Minnesota 
Fox News (07/09, Compton) reported that nearly 900 pounds of suspected methamphetamine worth 
approximately $1.7 million was seized in Minnesota and is considered as one of the largest meth busts in the 
state's history. Two men, 46-year-old Joel Casas-Santiago and 44-year-old Guillermo Mercado Chaparro, were 
arrested and charged with controlled substance crimes for their alleged involvement. The suspects are believed to 
be linked to a larger drug organization operating out of Mexico, according to investigators. "Nine hundred pounds 
of meth seized during two traffic stops in Minnesota yesterday, in a hit targeting drug trafficking rings you'll hear 
about soon," Deputy Director Bongino wrote in a post on X on Tuesday. "We're finding them and crushing their 
operations. More to come. Thanks to our U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration partners for the coordination." The 
article noted that Deputy Director Bongino also took to X earlier this week with statistics he says demonstrate the 
FBI's heightened focus on violent crime and illegal immigration "is working." Over the last few months, the FBI has 
seized 22% more illicit drugs than in the same period last year, including more than 97,000 pounds of cocaine, over 
7,000 pounds of meth and more than 2,500 pounds of fentanyl, he wrote. KTTC (NBC-10) (07/09, McCabe) 
and KMSP (Fox-9) (07/09, Wermus) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: FBI Launches Criminal Investigations of John Brennan, James Comey 
The New York Times (07/09, Thrush, Barnes) reported that the Trump administration is targeting former FBI 
director James B. Comey and former CIA director John O. Brennan, who oversaw the investigation into the 2016 
Trump campaign's connections to Russia. According to the article, CIA director John Ratcliffe made a criminal 
referral of Brennan to the FBI, accusing him of lying to Congress, while the FBI is also scrutinizing Comey's role in 
the Russia investigation. The article noted that even if it is unclear whether the moves will lead to charges, they are 
among the most significant indications that President Trump's appointees intend to follow through on his campaign 
to exact retribution against his perceived enemies. The article added that the investigation comes at a precarious 
moment for the appointed leadership of federal law enforcement agencies. Since Monday, Trump supporters on 
the far right have lashed out at Attorney General Bondi and FBI brass for closing the investigation into the death of 
the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Fox News (07/09, Wallace, Doocy, Singman) reported that during a meeting 
with African leaders in the State Room of the White House on Wednesday, Fox News senior White House 
correspondent Peter Doocy asked the president for his response to the investigation. "Do you want to see these 
two guys behind bars?" Doocy asked the president. "Well, I know nothing about it other than what I read today," 
Trump said. "But I will tell you, I think they're very dishonest people. I think they're crooked as hell. And, maybe 
they have to pay a price for that. I believe they are truly bad people and dishonest people," the president added.
