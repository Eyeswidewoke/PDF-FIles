ver= costly, very ! ( however many structures available some=risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my 
teams doing the work , not yours. =AO Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator. =C2 not sure what role you

two months ago , no one was even int=rviewed and even now , Brad, a very nice man, is not even furl time,(crazy ) 
Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him . a=d his new staff. Eileen followed your instructions. not mine. 
in fa=t she continued to ignore mine saying " but Leon said =AO" or " its on Leon's desk etc " , Y=u would become 
frustrated when i pointed out each instance. of her obfusca=ion. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save 
=oney ,you chose not to hire my team . I was hired to do the ar=hitecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the 
head. =AO instructions were given by me,  detailed but ignored by her. ( e=cept in the instances where I inserted myself
