10.2 
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Barton or the Barton Parties be liable to 
you or any third party for any consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, special, or 
punitive damages, including any damages for business interruption, loss of use, loss of data, 
or loss of revenue or profly in each case regardless of whether such damages arise from any 
breach of contract, tort, or otherwise, and regardless of whether such damages were 
foreseeable or whether the possibility ofsuch damages was advised. 
11. Insurance. You represent that, as required by your needs or applicable state law, you presently 
have, or during the Term will procure and maintain, adequate workers' compensation, general 
liability, unemployment, and other required forms of insurance covering you and each of your 
employees, agents, and contractors. You understand and agree that Barton shall not be responsible 
for procuring or providing, or for reimbursing you for procuring or maintaining, any such insurance 
coverage; provided. however, that the foregoing shall not limit the provisions of Section 4. 
12. Other Business Activities. As an independent contractor of Barton you may be engaged or 
employed in any other business, trade, profession, or activity that does not cause a breach or 
violation of any term or provision of this Agreement. 
13. Miscellaneous.
13.1 
All rights and remedies in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive. The 
exercise by either party of any right or remedy does not predude the exercise of any other rights or 
remedies that may now or subsequently be available at law, in any other agreement between the 
parties, or otherwise. Despite the previous sentence, the parties intend that Barton's right to 
Cancellation Fees under Section 5.3(b) is Barton's exclusive remedy and your sole liability for any 
Cancellation Event, and that Barton's right to a Conversion Fee under Section 8 is Barton's 
exclusive remedy and your sole liability for any Conversion. The parties intend that each of the 
Cancellation Fees and Conversion Fee constitutes compensation, not a penalty. The parties 
acknowledge and agree that, because Barton's harm caused by any Cancellation Event or any 
Conversion would be impossible or very difficult to accurately estimate, the Cancellation Fees and 
Conversion Fee, respectively, is each a reasonable estimate of the anticipated or actual harm that 
might arise from any such Cancellation Event or Conversion. 
13.2 
This Agreement, together with all POs, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of 
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous 
understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to 
such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and those of 
any PO, the following order of precedence shall govern: (i) first, this Agreement, exclusive of any 
POs; and (ii) second, all POs (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in a PO). 
13.3 
No amendment to or modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement is 
effective unless in writing and signed by each party, provided that the terms of any PO may be 
modified by the parties' mutual written agreement (including via email). Handwritten changes to this 
Agreement or any PO are void and shall not be binding on either party. No failure or delay in 
exercising any right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate as a 
waiver thereof, nor shall any partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege preclude any 
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege. 
13.4 
This Agreement and all POs shall be governed by and construed in accordance with 
the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to any choice- or
