Income taxes 
Match Group, Inc. is a member of IAC's consolidated federal and state income tax returns. In all periods presented, current and deferred income tax expense 
has been computed for Match Group. Inc. on an as if stand-alone, separate retum basis. 
The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by 
determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related 
appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized 
upon ultimate settlement. 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences 
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A 
valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The 
Company records interest, net of any applicable related income tax benefit, on potential income tax contingencies as a component of income tax expense.

local currency revenue and expenses of these operations are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Translation gains and losses are 
included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses resulting from assets and 
liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the combined statement of operations as a component of other income 
(expense), net.

separately from the Company's equity. However, securities that are redeemable at the option of the holder and not solely within the control of the issuer must 
be classified outside of shareholder equity. Accordingly, if redemption of the noncontrolling interests is outside the control of the Company, the interests are 
included outside of shareholder equity in the accompanying combined balance sheet. 
In connection with the acquisition of certain subsidiaries. current and former senior management of these businesses has retained an ovmership interest. The 
Company is party to fair value put and call arrangements with respect to these interests. These put and call arrangements allow management of these 
businesses to require the Company to purchase these interests or allow the Company to acquire such interests at fair value. respectively. The put 
arrangements do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument as the put agreements do not provide for net settlement. No put and call arrangements 
were exercised during 2012 and 2014. During 2013, one of these arrangements was exercised. These put arrangements are exercisable by the counter-party 
outside the control of the Company. Accordingly, to the extent that the fair value of these interests exceeds the value determined by normal noncontrolling 
interest accounting, the value of such Interests is adjusted to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to invested capital. During 2012, there were no fair 
value adjustments recorded. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. the Company recorded adjustments of $19.3 million and $21.1 million, 
respectively, to increase these interests to fair value. Fair value determinations require high levels of judgment and are based on venous valuation techniques,
