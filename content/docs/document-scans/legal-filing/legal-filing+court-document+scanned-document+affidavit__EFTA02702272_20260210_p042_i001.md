Similarly, notice of nominations to be brought before a special meeting of stockholders for the election of 
directors is required to be delivered to the secretary not earlier than the ninetieth day prior to such special 
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth day prior to such special meeting or the 
tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. 
The notice of any nomination for election as a director is required to set forth: 
• 
as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director. 
all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for 
election of directors, or is otherwise required. in each case pursuant to Regulation I4A under the 
Exchange Act, or any successor rule or regulation: and 
• 
as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any. on whose behalf the nomination 
is made (I) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on our books, and of such 
beneficial owner, and (2) the class and number of our shares which are owned beneficially and of 
record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. 
Restrictions on Ownership Under Insurance Laws 
Although our certificate of incorporation and by-laws do not contain any provision restricting ownership as 
a result of the application of various state insurance laws, these laws will be a significant deterrent to any person 
interested in acquiring our control. The insurance holding company laws of each of the jurisdictions in which our 
insurance subsidiaries are incorporated or commercially domiciled, as well as state corporation laws, govern any 
acquisition of control of our insurance subsidiaries or of us. In general, these laws provide that no person or 
entity may directly or indirectly acquire control of an insurance company unless that person or entity has 
received the prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. An acquisition of control generally would be
presumed in the case of any person or entity who purchases 10% or more of our outstanding common stock, 
unless the applicable insurance regulatory authorities determine otherwise. 
Delaware General Corporation Law 
The terms of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law apply to us since we are a Delaware 
corporation and our certificate of incorporation does not exclude us from the restrictions imposed thereunder. 
Pursuant to Section 203. with certain exceptions, a Delaware corporation may not engage in any of a broad range 
of business combinations, such as mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, with an "interested stockholder," 
as defined below, for a period of three years from the date that such person became an interested stockholder 
unless: 
• 
the transaction that results in a person becoming an interested stockholder, or the business combination 
is approved by the board of directors of the corporation before the person becomes an interested 
stockholder, 
• 
upon consummation of the transaction which results in the stockholder becoming an interested 
stockholder, the interested stockholder owns 85% or more of the voting stock of the corporation 
outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by persons who are 
directors and also officers. and shares owned by certain employee stock plans; or 
• 
on or after the time the person becomes an interested stockholder, the business combination is 
approved by the corporation's board of directors and by holders of at least two-thirds of the 
corporation's outstanding voting stock, excluding shares owned by the interested stockholder. at a 
meeting of stockholders. 
Under Section 203, an "interested stockholder" is defined as any person. other than the corporation and any 
direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary, that is: 
• 
the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation; or
