S-I/A 
Just as sellers face many challenges with the traditional system of accepting payment cards, they also face issues accessing 
and deploying funds to run and grow their businesses. We have applied the same capabilities and insights we used to develop our 
payments and POS services to address this need as well. We believe our financial services demonstrate the strength of our 
strategy, execution, and opportunity. 
Square Capital provides merchant cash advances to prequalified sellers. We make it easy for sellers to use our service by 
proactively reaching out to them with an offer of an advance based on their payment processing history. The terms are 
straightforward, sellers get their funds quickly (often the next business day), and in return, they agree to make payments equal to a 
percentage of the payment volume we process for them up to a fixed amount. We receive these payments seamlessly through 
each card transaction we process for them up to a fixed amount. The service has a strong recurring nature, with nearly 90% of 
sellers who have been offered a second Square Capital advance choosing to accept it. We currently fund a significant majority of 
these advances from arrangements with third parties that commit to purchase the future receivables related to these advances. This 
funding significantly increases the speed with which we can scale Square Capital and allows us to mitigate our balance sheet risk. 
Payroll is another area where our payments business provides the foundation for the type of opportunity we have realized 
with Square Capital. Like payments and business financing, payroll services exist within a complex and highly regulated industry. 
Payroll is one of the largest operating expenses for small businesses. In 2010. small businesses paid 42% of private sector payroll, 
according to the U.S. Small Business Administration's March 2014 report. Square Payroll is an affordable, easy-to-use payroll 
service for sellers, optimized for those with hourly employees. It works seamlessly with Square Register to automatically track 
employee hours worked. This reduces complexity, saving time and money for our sellers. We recently introduced Square Payroll in 
California, and we plan to expand it to additional states.

Marketing Services 
We also use the insights derived from our payments and POS services to develop unique marketing services that help our 
sellers reach customers and increase sales. Square Customer Engagement helps sellers understand their businesses, engage 
customers in ongoing conversations, and promote their offerings through email marketing. The result is a personalized and 
improved shopping experience for buyers that helps drive growth for sellers. By linking buyer payment cards and information to 
marketing efforts conducted in our ecosystem, we have created a closed loop that allows sellers to easily assess the return on their 
marketing efforts—a difficult feat in the offline world. 
Mobile device proliferation has also enabled delivery-as-a-service. Caviar, our food delivery offering, helps restaurants reach 
customers and increase sales without having to create and manage their own delivery logistics. By providing delivery services for 
them, Caviar makes it easy for restaurants to expand their reach with little additional overhead. Buyers can access Caviar through 
our iOS and Android mobile apps or through our Caviar website. 
Our Opportunity 
We believe there is a substantial opportunity for our end-to-end commerce ecosystem to connect functions that previously 
existed as silos: payments, POS services, financial services, and marketing services. We earn revenue from activity in our 
ecosystem from fees charged on payment volume, as well as from software revenue paid to us by our sellers. 
Payments services are expected to grow rapidly as buyers and sellers use payment cards instead of cash and checks. We 
earn a transaction fee for payment processing services. According to The Nilson Report published in December 2014, consumer 
payment card purchase volume is expected to reach $7.6 trillion in 2018. The Nilson Report published in January 2015 estimates 
this volume to reach $10.0 trillion in 2023. We connect payments to the POS with Square Register, and we expect to increase the 
number of software services that we offer to our sellers. U.S. small and medium-sized businesses, including micro businesses, 
were projected to spend approximately $11 billion on all types of SaaS products in 2014, growing to approximately S17 billion by 
2018. 
We also generate revenue from additional products that address other large market opportunities. Square Capital meets the 
demand from our sellers for financing, a critical service that enables them to grow and in turn drives additional payments activity 
with us. We generate revenue based on the amount of capital provided to our sellers. According to the FDIC O4 2014 report, there 
were $130 billion in small business loans outstanding under $100,000 as of December 2014, and according to a 2013 Oliver 
Wyman report, there is $80 billion of demand for small business new-form lending lines of credit. Square Payroll meets another
