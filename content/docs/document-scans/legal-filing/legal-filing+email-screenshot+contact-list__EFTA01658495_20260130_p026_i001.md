advocating on behalf of military personnel." Army Command Sgt. Maj. Sheryl Lyon, who 
previously "served as the Command Sergeant Major of the U.S. Army Cyber Command, joined 
CYBERCOM after the departure of Marine Master Gunnery Sgt. Scott Stalker, who left to fill the 
same position at U.S. Space Command." 
Security Experts Warn Of TikTok's Risk For Lawmakers. 
CQ Roll Call (9/30, Donnelly, 154K) reports despite official warnings "for nearly a year about the 
security risks of the Chinese-owned TikTok video-sharing app, several politicians who might be 
ideal targets for Beijing's spies still have accounts." These include two "former presidential 
candidates, plus members of Congress who oversee military, intelligence and digital security 
programs." Also on the list "are at least a couple of House candidates, including a former Green 
Beret with a top-secret security clearance who is a consultant to defense contractors." Rep. 
Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) a former CIA officer, cited "deep reservations" about her fellow 
members of Congress using TikTok. Council on Foreign Relations digital security expert Adam 
Segal "said taking the app off a lawmaker's phone probably ensures that the security risk is 
relatively low." Segal and others "have pointed out that Beijing's reported hacks of the personal 
data of millions of Americans, including government officials, through intrusions into the 
personnel files at the Office of Personnel Management and other entities, has created more of a 
risk than TikTok."

More Unknown Michigan Homicide Victims Being Exhumed In Effort At DNA 
Identification. 
MLive (MI) (9/30, Clark, 925K) reports from Wayne County, Michigan, "The Detroit Police 
Department and its law enforcement partners throughout southeast Michigan are continuing 
efforts to identify the remains of unknown homicide victims using DNA and new technology that 
were unavailable when the victims were buried." MLive adds, "Operation UNITED, which stands 
for Unknown Names Identified Through Exhumation and DNA, began its next phase of 
exhumations Tuesday, Sept. 29, at United Memorial Cemetery in Plymouth, according to Detroit 
police. Officials will be at the cemetery from Sept. 29 to Oct. 1, carefully exhuming the remains 
to take DNA samples in hopes of identifying the people." The samples "are collected and sent to 
the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System and uploaded into the Combined DNA 
Index System, as well as the FBI's National DNA Index System where they are then searched 
against all appropriate indexes for potential associations, police said."

Barr Pledges More Federal Aid To Help Deal With Oklahoma Tribal Crime. 
The AP (9/30) reports from Tahlequah, Oklahoma that Attorney General Barr "promised more 
manpower and federal aid to Oklahoma on Wednesday to help tribal governments and federal 
prosecutors deal with an increase in criminal cases stemming from a recent U.S. Supreme 
Court decision." According to the AP, "During a visit to the Cherokee Nation headquarters, Barr 
said the U.S. Department of Justice plans to fund two federal prosecutor positions in the 
northern and eastern U.S. districts of Oklahoma to handle the increased caseloads." The 
Supreme Court ruled in McGirt v. Oklahoma that "either the federal government or the tribal 
nation has jurisdiction over crimes committed by or against Native Americans, not the state. 
'Obviously we didn't plan on the McGirt decision when we were deploying the resources from 
the last budget cycle, but we have pressing needs now for our prosecutors and for the prison 
system,' Barr said during a meeting with Cherokee Nation leaders and U.S. attorneys from the 
two districts."
