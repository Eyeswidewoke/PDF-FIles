United States Courts Opinions: Supreme Court of New York: Neary v Burns US Official 
News April 1, 2014 Tuesday 
(annexed as exhibit 2 to Burns' motion papers) lists the voting percentage interests of its 
members as being: 44.8% for the Estate of John, 18.4% for Grace, 18.4% for Julia, and 
18.4% for the Neary Group, consisting of three listed members, i.e., Neary, Salvatore, and 
Mary Ann. At some time prior to 2011, Julia died, and her estate passed to her two sons, 
Benevento and Anthony Bevent (Anthony), in equal shares, pursuant to a will which also 
named them as co-executors. 
In April 2009, members of Neptune LLC were requested to vote on a proposal to sell the 
Neptune Avenue premises. Benevento (on behalf of the Estate of Julia) and Neary voted 
no to this proposal. By a letter dated April 21, 2009, the members of Neptune LLC were 
informed that on April 20, 2009, 73.3% of the Neptune LLC's membership had voted in 
favor of this proposal, and that, as a result, Burns was authorized to sell the Neptune 
Avenue premises at the highest and best price possible and to take any necessary steps 
to do so, including vacating all tenants from such premises. 
In September 2009, Burns, on behalf of 2784 LLC, executed a purchase agreement to sell 
the 2784 premises to M & A Realty Services, LLC for a sales price of $1,050,000. In 2010, 
the 2784 premises were sold with the purchase price for this sale paid in cash and by a 
purchase money mortgage. Prior to the sale, 2784 LLC's members signed a Certificate of 
Members of 2784 LLC Resolution to Sell Real Property (the Certificate) in accordance with 
section 3.4 of the Operating Agreement, which required that the manager have prior 
written approval of a majority vote of all members in order to sell the 2784 premises. The 
Certificate was signed by the Estate of John (by Judice), Grace (by Burns, as her attorney-
in-fact), the Estate of Julia (by Anthony), and the Neary Group (by Mary Ann, as the 
authorized representative), and reflected their respective interests in 2784 LLC of 44.8% 
for the Estate of John, 18.4% for Grace, 18.4% for the Estate of Julia, and 18.4% 
collectively for the Neary Group. 
Using the funds obtained from this sale of the 2784 LLC premises, Burns, as the manager 
of 2784 LLC, gave a mortgage and loan from it to Neptune LLC for $250,000 at five 
percent interest with a mortgage on the Neptune Avenue premises to be paid when these 
premises are sold. These monies were allegedly used to buy out the non-family tenants of 
the Neptune Avenue premises so as to have them vacate their apartments there. 
On August 13, 2010, an action was filed by Neptune LLC against Neary, Benevento, 
Carmel Salerno (Carmel), and the Estate of Julia (363-367 Neptune Avenue, LLC v Neary, 
Sup Ct, Kings County, index No. 9282/10) (the Neptune Avenue action) for a judgment 
requiring Neary, Benevento, and Carmel to vacate their apartments, requiring (*3]the 
Estate of Julia to take action to remove Neary, Benevento, and Carmel from such 
apartments, and awarding damages in the sum of $108,000 against Neary, $216,000 
against Benevento, and $324,000 against Carmel due to their failure to vacate. In the 
Neptune Avenue action, Neary and Benevento asserted that Burns had harassed them, 
refused to make repairs to the building, and denied them essential services in an effort to 
make the building uninhabitable so that they would be forced to vacate it. Neptune LLC, in 
that action, contended that it was entitled to sell and vacate the Neptune Avenue premises 
pursuant to the Operating Agreement for Neptune LLC. By a decision and order dated 
December 15, 2010. Justice Mark I. Partnow denied a motion by Neptune LLC to require 
Neary, Benevento, and Carmel to vacate the Neptune Avenue premises, finding that while
