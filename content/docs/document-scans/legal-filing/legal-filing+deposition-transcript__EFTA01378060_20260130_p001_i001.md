Foreign account tax compliance act 
Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, collectively, FATCA, a U.S. federal withholding tax of 
30% generally will be imposed on certain payments made to a 'foreign financial institution" (as specifically defined under these rules) unless such institution 
enters into an agreement with the U.S. tax authorities to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial 
information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account 
holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or meets other exceptions. Under the legislation and administrative guidance, a U.S. federal withholding tax 
of 30% generally also will be imposed on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a 
certification identifying its direct and indirect U.S. owners or meets other exceptions. Foreign entities located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental 
agreement with the United States governing these withholding and reporting requirements may be subject to different rules. Under certain circumstances. a 
non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. These withholding taxes would be Imposed on dividends paid with respect to our 
common stock to, and on gross proceeds from sales or other dispositions of our common stock after December 31, 2018 by, foreign financial institutions or 
non-financial entities (including in their capacity as agents or custodians for beneficial owners of our common stock) that fail to satisfy the above requirements. 
Prospective non-U.S. holders should consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in our common stock.
