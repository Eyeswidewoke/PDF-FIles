UBS Client Relationship Agreement 
necessary or advisable. You also agree to maintain sufficient assets in your Account to satisfy 
any and all margin calls issued in connection with the Account. 
As long as your Account is a margin account, you authorize UBS in the usual course of 
business to lend, pledge as collateral, hypothecate, relend or repledge any Property we carry 
for you on margin, whether separately or together with Property of others, either to ourselves 
or to others. This authorization remains in effect until we receive payment for such Property. 
When you use your margin privileges, as permitted by law, we may use certain securities in 
your Account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending securities for short 
sales. We may receive and retain compensation in connection with such transactions. If you are 
engaged in short selling a security, you may incur a charge due to certain borrowing costs for 
that particular security. 
Subject to applicable rules and regulations, we may amend the requirements applicable to your 
margin account at any time in our sole and absolute discretion, including, without limitation, 
changing the level of credit available to you and applicable maintenance requirements; all 
without notice to you. A prior demand or call, or prior notice of the time and place of such 
sale or purchase shall not be considered a waiver of our right to sell or buy without demand or 
notice as described herein. For additional terms, please refer to the section "Liquidation of 
Collateral or Account" below. 
We have the right to satisfy a margin call or to require or obtain full or partial payment of a 
margin loan at any time without a demand for margin or additional margin or other notice. To 
satisfy a margin call or to obtain full or partial payment of the margin loan, in addition to all 
rights provided by law, we have the right to: 
1. 
require additional collateral, 
2. 
sell any Property in any of your Accounts with us, whether carried individually or 
jointly with others, 
3. 
buy any Property which may be held short in your Account, 
4. 
cancel any open orders and dose any or all outstanding contracts, or 
S. 
liquidate any of your Accounts with us. 
We may also exercise these rights at any time in our sole and absolute discretion. 
If you are an individual (including an individual acting as trustee of a trust) residing in or 
located in any country in the European Economic Area: you represent and warrant that you do 
not intend to use any part of a margin loan, and will not now or in the future use any part of a 
margin loan, for the acquiring or retaining of property rights in land or in an existing or 
projected building, or for the renovation of residential property. 
You understand that there are substantial risks involved in trading securities on 
margin, using leverage as a liquidity source or as part of your investment strategy, or 
otherwise pledging your securities in order to obtain credit. Please review the Loan 
Disclosure Statement included in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet carefully 
for a detailed discussion of these risks.

incurred under this or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including but not

Entity for you or on your behalf in or credited to any UBS Account(s) (other than qualified plan 
or IRA accounts or other accounts where doing so would be a prohibited transaction or 
violation of applicable law or regulation) and in any other Account with any UBS Entity in 
which you may have any legal, equitable or other interest. 
All such Property will be subject to such security interest as collateral for the discharge of your 
obligations to any UBS Entity, wherever or however arising and without regard to whether or 
not we made loans with respect to that Property. In enforcing our security interest, we have 
the discretion to determine the amount, order and manner in which the Property will be sold 
hypothecation is the pledging of securities 
or other assets to secure a loan such as a 
debit balance in a margin account.
