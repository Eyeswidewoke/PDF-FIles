About House of SpeakEasy 
SpeakEasy was established in 2013 by a group of prominent writers and literary professionals to support the art of 
writing in all its diverse forms. Its mission is to promote innovative ways of bringing writers and their audiences 
together. SpeakEasy seeks to raise awareness of great writing and to provide the public with entertaining and 
exciting ways to connect with the literary arts. 
SpeakEasys flagship program is "Seriously Entertaining", a monthly showcase of outstanding literary talent. 
Presented in dinner-theater style, each SpeakEasy cabaret features a variety of writers from across the genres, 
from fiction to non-fiction, from the dramatic arts to stand-up comedy - with poetry and song forming a key part 
of the evening. Every event has a title - a central theme - that is reflected, embodied by, or otherwise meditated 
upon by the writers on the stage. The SpeakEasy style of performance is based on a simple format; short 
monologue-style deliveries that are rehearsed but feel casual and spontaneous. It is the old lecture-hall mode of 
literary readings reborn and refreshed for the modern age. 
SpeakEasy has chosen City Winery as the venue for its New York series. Located at 155 Varick Street, City Winery 
is a convivial downtown space that provides intimacy and immediacy, along with room for an audience of 300, 
and a state-of-the-art stage. The program is beginning in early 2014, with monthly events, except for a break 
during the summer, until the end of the year. Our current roster of participating artists includes Jonathan Alter, 
Andy Borowitz, Susan Cheever, Simon Doonan, Ralph Fiennes, Stephen Fry, Michael Friedman, David Gilbert, 
Adam Gopnik, Mark Kingwell, Stephen Lang, Jay McInerney, Susan Orlean, Jay Parini, Katie Roiphe, Gretchen 
Rubin, Dan Stevens, Amor Towles, Dana Vachon, Amanda Vaill, Harriet Walter, Caroline Weber, and Simon 
Winchester. 
Central to SpeakEasy's mission is the insight that for writers to continue to earn a living from their craft, a new 
economic model is required. As a first step, in addition to selling books and duds at every event, SpeakEasy 
compensates its performers by sharing the box office with them. Second, SpeakEasy is creating a digital platform 
to distribute recordings of the evenings, promote our participants' books and music, and create a community of 
passionate readers online. 
To extend SpeakEasy's reach to a broader literary community, however, it is our hope that the success of the gala 
and the 2014 program will enable us to take the SpeakEasy mission to schools and other educational settings in 
ways that will inspire future generations of writers. Whether that is connecting established writers with high 
schools and educational institutions ('A writer in every classroom') or providing supplementary teaching 
materials and tickets to teachers for SpeakEasy events (SpeakFreely), SpeakEasy aims to introduce young people 
to the best writing of today. 
About the founders 
SpeakEasy is the brainchild of Dr. Amanda Foreman, An internationally best-selling and prize-winning author, 
Amanda has long been involved in the broader literary community as a scholar, writer, and judge for prizes such 
as the Man Booker and the National Book Award. Last year, together with Lucas Wittmann, she established and 
hosted a series of speaking events in New York for a UK-based organization called 5x15. These events featured 
five speakers, each discussing their work for 15 minutes. There were some outstanding evenings in the company 
of such luminaries as Paul Muldoon, Edward Hirsch, Hari Kunzru, Nathaniel Rich, Dambisa Moyo, Philip 
Gourevitch, Niall Ferguson, Peter Godwin, Jim Holt, Gretchen Rubin, Amber Tamblyn, Grace Coddington, and 
Andrew Solomon. 
Following the success of those NY events, Amanda and Lucas wanted to do more for the literary community at 
large, and so decided to establish SpeakEasy. They assembled an exceptional board comprising Paul LeClerc, 
former head of the New York Public Library; Camille Massey, VP at the Council on Foreign Relations; Uma 
Thurman, actress, Elizabeth Wagley, founder of the National Memo; Susan Fales-Hill, author; and Jonathan 
Barton, a partner of a New York-based hedge fund.
