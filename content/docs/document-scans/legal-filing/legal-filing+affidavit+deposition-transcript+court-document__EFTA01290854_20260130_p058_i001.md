Important Information and Disclosures 
Pricing 
This section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including short positions, at the close of the statement period. The market prices, unless otherwise noted, 
have been obtained from independent vendor services, which we believe to be reliable. Market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ from the actual sale price. Securities for which a price is 
not available are marked 'N/A" and are omitted from the Total.

be available for investment due to unsettled transactions against your account(s). Prices for marketable securities are received from various pricing services thought to be reliable; however. pricing services are

are priced via third party sources believed to be reliable. 
For certain securities, including thinly-traded securities, debt securities in default, securities that do not have a valid pricing source, and certain third-party structured products, the last available pricing will be 
listed. If the last price available for such securities is unchanged for a period of time deemed appropriate for that asset. the current price will purge and N/A will be placed in the price field in the statement. The 
pricing of listed options takes into account the last closing price, as well as the current bid and offer prices.

quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant. A capital gain or return of principal may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to 
vAwrpershing.conbusiness_continuity.htrri for specific deeds as to formulas used to calculate the figures. Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received.
