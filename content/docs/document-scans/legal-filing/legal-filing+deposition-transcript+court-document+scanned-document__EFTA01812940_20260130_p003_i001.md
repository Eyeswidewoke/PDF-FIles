veneration of nature unspoiled by man, but partnership. Now a professor at the 
prestigious Versailles National School of Landscape Architecture, he is its only lecturer 
to teach natural history as well as design concepts. Young admirers turn out in droves to 
hear him lecture all over France and would make him into a guru, were he not 
humorous and unassuming. Not unlike other masters of the profession, he himself 
prefers to be called, simply, a gardener. 
Life-changing moment: As a teenager, helping his father spray roses with a highly toxic 
chemical, he got some in an open cut and spent two days in a coma. Soon after, Clement 
escaped his father's highly regimented garden in the beautifully wooded Creuse area 
south of Paris to study nature in a nearby valley, and in 1977, he was able to buy the 
land in Creuse where he had sought refuge when he was young. He built a stone house 
there with his own hands and transformed the clearing into one of France's most 
admired gardens, now called La Vallee. It is still a sanctuary for himself, family, friends 
and other fauna. 
At La Vallee, Clement first experimented with the "Moving Garden" (le jardin en 
mouvement), influential as of 1985. Abandoned farmland, left to its own devices, gradually 
evolves toward forest growth. For Clement, the gardener's intervention is not only 
admissible, it is central. He observes: "Watching wasteland, I am not only fascinated by 
the energy of nature's reclamation, I also want to know how to insert myself in the midst 
of this powerful flow." He chooses the moment when spontaneous growth involves all 
the elements usually found in a garden: trees, shrubs, vines, bulbs, grasses — even wild 
roses. The gardener's role then is to guide and enrich in sympathy with natural process, 
integrating accidents like fallen trees. Clement uses no chemicals, no supplemental 
watering and no noisy, energy-wasting machinery. But he does prune: A self-sown 
willow is trimmed to show off its multiple trunks; wild hornbeams are clipped into 
smooth domes; a path uphill meanders through the heart of a sprawling smokebush 
(Colima obovatus). Most paths are simply mown grass, their routing changing from year to 
year to preserve self-sown clumps of foxglove, verbascum or hogweed, which draws 
many interesting insects. "A garden is always artificial," he insists, "but home gardens 
can become wildlife preserves." 
Movement, as he sees it, involves seasonal variation and change due to self-sowing and 
species migration. Moving gardens, lived in or visited, are never purely visual but very 
tactile — you kneel, lie down, rub against, smell, inhale. "My gardens are meant to be 
brushed against," writes Clement. I-Iis first book devoted to the Moving Garden has 
been reprinted five times. 
In the late '80s and '90s, Clement worked on mainly public projects such as a main 
section of the Parc Andre-Citroen in Paris (with landscape designer Main Provost and 
architects Patrick Berger, Jean-Francois Jodry and Jean-Paul Viguier), the Valloires 
Abbey gardens (Les Jardins de Valloires) in Picardy, the Jardins de la Grande Arche de la
