The plans were adopted in 2009 and 2014, have a stated term of ten years, and provide that the exercise price of stock options granted will not be less than 
the fair value of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The plans do not specify grant dates or vesting schedules of awards as those 
determinations have been delegated to the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of IAC's Board of Directors (the "Committee"). Each grant 
agreement reflects the vesting schedule for that particular grant as determined by the Committee. Broad-based stock option awards issued to date have 
generally vested in two equal annual installments over a three-year period. 
The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the combined statement of operations is reduced by estimated forfeitures. as the expense 
recorded is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised. 
if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated rate. At December 31, 2014, there is $32.0 million of unrecognized 
compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures. related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
approximately 2 years. 
The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying combined statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012. 2013 and 2014 
related to stock-based compensation is $4.9 million, $4.1 million and $7.9 million, respectively.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing 
model incorporates various assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term. Prior to 2014, expected stock price volatilities were estimated based 
on historical stock price volatilities of peer companies that were chosen on the basis of their similarity to the Company in terms of consumer use, monetization 
model, margin and growth characteristics and brand strength. At the beginning of 2014 the Company concluded that the most relevant reference point for 
determining volatility was IAC's historical volatility as a result of the Company representing a large percentage of the overall value of IAC. The risk-free 
interest rates are based on U.S. Treasuries with comparable terms as the awards, in effect at the grant date. Expected term is based upon the mid-point of 
the first and last windows for exercise. No dividends have been assumed. The following are the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes 
option pricing model:
