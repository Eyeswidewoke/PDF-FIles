PREFACE 
The HLX8 is a quantum leap in technology for the treatment of many medical ailments afflicting 
people all over the world. The design of the HLX8 came from investigation into an entirely new theory 
pertaining to the structure of matter and what holds not only the universe together but also each 
molecule within the human body. By utilizing this knowledge the HLX8 was designed to optimize the 
function of each cell within the human body whether the user is very ill or extremely healthy. 
The HLX8 utilizes a totally non-invasive field of structured ions to influence individual cells by 
manipulating the invisible electromagnetic fields which surround each cell in the body. By controlling 
these invisible fields we can control the visible cells and optimize life functions throughout the body. 
This theory is being validated every day by users of the HLX8 and the results they are getting. The 
HLX8 emits no harmful radiation and there have been no side effects with proper use of the unit on its 
own. There are no pills to take or any additional treatment required for the full benefits of the HLX8 to 
be realized by each user. The HLX8 may be used along with other treatments that you wish to use as 
long as you use the HLX8 as directed. 
In this information package you will read about what the HLX8 is and the story behind its creation. 
You will learn what ailments it can treat and how to use the machine. You will read about the key 
people involved with the project, what the HLX8 has done for them as well as what they have seen it 
do for others. There are some testimonials provided by additional users of the HLX8 explaining what 
it has done for them personally. Then finally there are some frequently asked questions about the 
HLX8. 
As of May 1, 2008 the prototype version of the HLX8 is available for purchase in limited quantities. In 
July 2008 the production model of the HLX8 will be available for purchase and prototype models of 
the HLX8 can be exchanged for the production model at that time if so desired. The current selling 
price of the HLX8 is $10,000 U.S. and the results are guaranteed in writing by Nebion LLC. If you use 
the HLX8 as directed for 60 days and you have not achieved positive results you may return the 
HLX8 for a full refund minus a 10% handling charge. We accept VISA, MasterCard, American 
Express, and Discover for payment of the HLX8. Currently we are able to ship the HLX8 within one 
week of your order and there is a one year guarantee on manufacturer's defects and reliable 
operation of the unit for personal use. 
This package is pre-release information that will also be included on our website when it goes online 
this summer. We do not have a website up currently as demand would exceed our current HLX8 
supply. We can only inform a select group of people in a controlled way to view this information 
before our actual HLX8 release date this summer. 
We hope the information in this package answers any questions you may have and leads you to 
make an informed decision regarding the purchase of an HLX8. Our goal at Nebion is to help the 
people of the world live a longer and healthier life free of disease and pain. We hope that we can help 
you. 
Many thanks from our team at Nebion LLC for your interest in the HLX8
