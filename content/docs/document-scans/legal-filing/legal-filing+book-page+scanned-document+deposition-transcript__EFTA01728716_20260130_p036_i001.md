quent adolescent who actively participated in his victimization. Investigators 
often nonverbally communicate their judgmental attitude unknowingly through 
gestures, facial expressions, and body language. 
In interviewing victims of acquaintance sexual exploitation, law enforcement 
should consider—in their own minds—pretending that the victim is a subject or 
suspect, and expect the victim to deny or minimize his or her acts. Some victims 
will continue to deny their victimization no matter what the interviewer says or 
does. Some children even deny victimization that the offender has admitted or 
other evidence discloses. Some will make admissions but minimize the quality 
and quantity of the acts. They may minimize their compliance and maximize the 
offender's involvement by claiming he drugged them, threatened them, had a 
weapon, or had even abducted them. Of course some of these allegations may be 
accurate and should be investigated. They are, however, not typical of acquain-
tance-exploitation cases. Violence is most likely used to prevent disclosure. 
Sadistic preferential offenders may also use violence during sex, but this is rela-
tively rare in cases involving seduction. As previously discussed these potential 
inaccuracies in the details of the allegations of seduced victims may explain some 
of the inconsistencies between the alleged "what" and suspected "who." 
The investigator must communicate to the victim that he or she is not at fault 
even though the victim did not say no, did not fight, did not tell, initiated the sex, 
or even enjoyed it. When the victim comes to believe that the investigator under-
stands what he experienced, he or she is more likely to talk. Victims often reveal 
the details little by little, testing the investigator's response. The investigator must 
recognize and sometimes allow the victim to use face-saving scenarios when dis-
closing victimization. For example such victims might claim they were confused, 
tricked, asleep, drugged, drunk, or tied up when they were not. Adolescents, 
who pose special challenges for the interviewer, use these face-saving devices most 
often. The investigator must accept the fact that even if a victim discloses the 
information is likely to be incomplete, minimizing his involvement and acts. Some 
of these victims simply do not believe they were victims. 
In the absence of some compelling special circumstance, the interview of a 
child possibly seduced by an acquaintance molester should never be conducted 
in the presence of parents. The presence of the parent increases the likelihood 
that the child will just deny or give the socially or parentally acceptable version of 
the victimization. This is especially true of younger victims. Investigators should 
also consider unannounced interviews of victims of acquaintance molesters. 
If all else fails the investigator can try the no-nonsense approach. No matter 
what the investigator does, most adolescent boy victims will deny they were 
victims. It is important, therefore, that as many potential victims as legally and 
ethically possible are interviewed. It is also possible that some troubled teenagers 
may exaggerate their victimization or even falsely accuse individuals. Allegations 
must be objectively investigated considering all possibilities. After disclosing, some 
victims will later recant or change their stories. 
The offender may also continue to manipulate the victims after investigation 
and disclosure. The offender may appeal to the victim's sympathy. He may make 
a feeble attempt at suicide to make the victims feel guilty or disloyal. Some 
offenders may threaten the victims with physical harm or disclosure of the black-
mail material. Some offenders may bribe the victim and his family. Even after 
they disclose and testify in court, some victims then recant and claim they per-
