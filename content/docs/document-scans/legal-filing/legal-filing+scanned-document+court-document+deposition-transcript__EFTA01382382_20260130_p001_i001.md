Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Ittbk of Contents 
upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested 
stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced. 
excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding those shares owned by persons who are directors and 
also officers and by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially 
whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or 
• on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized 
at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the 
outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
Section 203 defines "business combination" to include: any merger or consolidation involving us and the interested stockholder; 
any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of our assets involving the interested stockholder; in general, any 
transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by us of any of our stock to the interested stockholder; or the receipt by the interested 
stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through us. In general, 
Section 203 defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of 
the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by any such entity or person. A Delaware corporation 
may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of 
incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. We have opted out of this provision. Accordingly, we will not be subject to any anti-
takeover effects of Section 203. 
Removal of Directors; Vacancies 
Our certificate of incorporation provides that, following the 50% Trigger Date, directors may be removed with or without cause 
upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of the 
company entitled to vote in any annual election of directors or class of directors, voting together as a single class. In addition, our 
certificate of incorporation provides that vacancies, including those resulting from newly created directorships or removal of directors, 
may only be filled (i) by the Designated Controlling Stockholder or by a majority of the directors then in office, prior to the 50% Trigger 
Date, and (ii) after the 50% Trigger Date, by a majority of the directors then in office, in each case although less than a quorum, or by a 
sole remaining director. This may deter a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and gaining control of the board 
of directors by filling the remaining vacancies with its own nominees. 
Limitation on Director's Liability 
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. The DGCL 
permits a corporation to limit or eliminate a director's personal liability to the corporation or the holders of its capital stock for breach of 
duty. This limitation is generally unavailable for acts or omissions by a director which (i) were in bad faith. (ii) were the result of active and 
deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated or (iii) involved a financial profit or other advantage to 
which such director was not legally entitled. The DGCL also prohibits limitations on director liability for acts or omissions which resulted 
in a violation of a statute prohibiting certain dividend declarations, certain payments to stockholders after dissolution and particular types 
of loans. The effect of these provisions is to eliminate the rights of our company and our stockholders (through stockholders' derivative 
suits on behalf of our company) to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director (including 
breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior), except in the situations described above. These provisions will not limit the liability 
of directors under the federal securities laws of the United States.
