There are some 81 parties running for Tunisia's constituent assembly, yet only two have the resources needed for 
nationwide penetration on the campaign trail: the UPL and the moderate Islamist party, al-Nanda. 
Mechti would like to know more about the other parties, but as the election day of Sunday October 23 draws ever 
closer, time is running out. Aside from the UPL, the only other party Mechti has heard of is al-Nanda, a party he 
says he will not vote for. 
"I want to hear what all the parties are offering and then 
make my decision," he says. 
Most Tunisian political parties rely mainly on volunteers 
to win over potential voters. The UPL has an army of 
youths wearing red t-shirts bearing its slogan. Several of 
them in Souassi told Al Jazeera they had been on staff at 
the local office. 
Paid activists 
Boutas Abdallah, 28, is one of several dozen young men 
working to control the crowd at the rally. 
Though he has a degree in information technology, 
Abdallah was unemployed until he joined the UPL in 
early June. He now earns a salary of $211 a month, respectable by local standards. 
Under Tunisia's election regulations, the UPL has the right to pay activists such as Abdallah and his friends, so 
long as the total amount spent is within the limit for the electoral district. 
"I need work. I've been unemployed for three years," he says. "I like the party's values, I trust the UPL." 
After the crowd is warmed up, the UPL's leaders arrive in a fleet of black luxury cars. 
My interview with Slim Riahi takes place several hours later outside a gas station on the outskirts of town, in the 
front seat of his Porsche Cayenne. 
An entourage of Riahi's associates stand outside as dusk falls, their black Mercedes creating a protective barrier. 
Amongst those travelling with Riahi on the campaign trail is Balti, one of Tunisia's most famous rappers (on a 
similar note, Riahi has several football stars running as candidates for major electorates, including Chokri el-
Ouaer, a former national team goalkeeper, at the top of the UPL's list for Tunis). 
Few details of 39-year-old Riahi's biography are known. He sticks to the basics. 
Originally from coastal town of Enfidha, his family moved to Libya when he was a child. His father was an Arab 
nationalist, opposed to both the Bourguiba and Ben Ali regimes. 
He studied management at Al Fateh University in Tripoli, and went on to make his fortune in Libya's oil, aviation 
and real estate industries, working closely with British and US corporations. 
Later he moved to the UK, and his family all now live in London. His wife is Tunisian. Riahi himself has dual 
Tunisian-British nationality. 
The UPL's apparent success is due to its ability to connect with people, not the amount of money that has been 
spent, he says. 
"We speak the same language as the people," he says. "The money just helped us to put the word of the party on
