Notice of Important Change to Your Account Terms 
We are making a change to your account terms, which are contained in the American Express Cardmember 
Agreement ("Agreement") governing your Account referenced in this notice. Any language in the Agreement 
contrary to or conflicting with the terms amended below is deleted in its entirety to the extent of the conflict. All 
terms of the Agreement not amended herein remain in full force and effect. We urge you and any Additional 
Cardmembers on your Account to read the below notice carefully and file it along with your Agreement in a safe 
place for future reference. The detailed change to your Cardmember Agreement can be found after the summary 
chart. 
Summary of Changes 
Penalty APR 
for existing 
balances 
Effective immediately, we are removing the section on Penalty APR for existing balances 
from Your Cardmember Agreement. This language will no longer apply to your account. 
Please see the sections titled Penalty APR and When It Applies and Penalty APR for new 
transactions for information on the Penalty APR. 
Using the card 
Currently, you may arrange for merchants to store certain account information for certain 
purposes (for example, for recurring billing). When you arrange for merchants to store this 
information, you acknowledge that we may share updates to this information with these 
merchants. 
Effective August 15, 2016, we are updating your Cardmember Agreement to say that if 
you choose to store your account information with any third parties, we may also share 
updates to this information with these third parties. Please note that this only applies to 
third parties with whom you elect to share this information. 
Converting 
charges made 
in a foreign 
currency 
Effective August 15, 2016, we are updating your Cardmember Agreement to state that, for 
any charges you make in a foreign currency, AE Exposure Management Ltd. ("AEEML") 
will convert that charge into U.S. dollars. 
Closing your 
Account 
We are changing our policy for refunding Annual Membership fees for voluntary account 
cancellations taking place on or after September 1, 2016. 
If an Annual Membership fee applies to your Account, we will refund this fee if you notify 
us that you are voluntarily closing your Account within 30 days of the Closing Date of the 
billing statement on which that fee appears. For cancellations after this 30 day period, the 
Annual Membership fee is non•refundable. 
For example, if your Annual Fee is charged on a billing statement on which the Closing 
Date is April 2, you have until May 2 to voluntarily cancel your Account and receive a full 
refund. 
Please note that any Annual Membership fees for additional cards may appear on a 
different billing statement than the Annual Membership fee for the Basic Card Member's 
Account. This means that additional card fees may not be refunded if you cancel your 
Account.
