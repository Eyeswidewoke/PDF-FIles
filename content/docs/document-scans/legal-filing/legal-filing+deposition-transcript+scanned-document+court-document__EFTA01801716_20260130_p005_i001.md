trading=activities can be properly and completely segregated. The UK Independent Commission on Banking chaired by 
Sir John V=ckers proposed in 2011 that they could be preserved in a single institutio= but in separate entities, with the 
retail functions ringfenced with their=own higher capital levels. The Vickers Commission recommended that all 
derivatives services should be kep= outside this ringfence. 
The UK government accepted the argument that retail banks=should be able to maintain some 
simple derivatives functions such as produ=ts for hedging currency risk for business clients. The Barclays experience=is 
already leading politicians and commentators in the UK to argue that simple derivatives may be an oxymoron= Trying to 
define them may be a futile exercise, and one that will inevita=ly be gamed by banks. 
The UK government shows some reluctance to revisit its in=erpretation of the Vickers proposals. 
But if the British Parliamentary enq=iry into the LIBOR issue now concludes that the government has erred on th= side of 
trusting banks, then the pressure for an outcome closer to the original Vickers recommendation, to =e written into next 
year's Banking Act, will be intense. 
The universal banking debate will take another serious tw=st if the new leadership of Barclays 
ultimately decides to break the bank =p into a retail bank and an investment bank and broker/dealer. As extreme =s this 
sounds, the intangible costs in political and regulatory animus Barclays now attracts could suggest tha= a clean break 
makes sense. An arrangement that gave existing shareholders=a stake in both new institutions might be acceptable. 
Barclays would no doubt sell such a split as a smart comm=rcial move. But the political and 
regulatory subtext would be to undermine=the case that such banking agglomerations are both necessary and useful. 
A=though the French and German commitment to their own universal banking systems is very strong, such a split would 
=ertainly empower critics of the universal banking model in the EU and the =S. The Liikanen Group inquiry is due to 
report to the European Commission =n bank structure later this year. The Commission itself is then expected to issue its 
own recommendations on=bank structure. Both will certainly draw on the Barclays experience. 
The culture quest=on 
This bigger issue about the values of the trading floor i= going to prove hard to shake off. The 
role of securities divisions in dri=ing investment bank profits over the last two decades has predictably seen=a 
generation of securities managers rise to the leadership of investment and universal banks. While it is perh=ps unwise to 
generalise too much, most of these men have brought with them=the directness and self-belief that comes with 
surviving a career on the t=ading floor. 
They also bring with them a view of the market and of mar=et-making that is often at odds with 
the way most politicians understand t=em. Watching Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs trying to explain to the US 
=enate in 2010 why it was legitimate for Goldman Sachs as a market maker to be both long and short in the US pr=perty 
market at the same time reinforced the point. There is a yawning gul= between a trader's pragmatic view of financial 
markets and a wider poli=ical and public audience who generally interpret the market maker's pragmatism as cynicism, 
detachment and shor= termism, especially when it results in making a lot of money. 
Banks tend to be highly impatient with this public and po=itical ambivalence. Most banks' 
response to efforts at greater regulatio= of securities markets have often been rooted in the argument that these 
m=rkets are fundamentally a forum for free trade between consenting adults and should be treated as such. It is =his 
argument that the LIBOR-scandal, with its taint of market fixing, and =he persistent flow of suggestions of contempt for 
customers and clients, d=es so much to undermine. 
The events of the last two months have succeeded in cemen=ing for good the idea that the 
banking crisis of 2008 was ultimately the r=sult of unethical, 'casino' behaviour on the trading floor. Whatever f=ilings
