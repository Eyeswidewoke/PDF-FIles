Without a doubt, electric cars are the future= and in the meantime, advances developed by electric car-makers are 
being used in hybri= cars, such as our Prius and Cadillac, which give excellent mileage co=pared to the 12 mpg that my 
Jeep Grand Wagoner and 15 mpg Jaguar use to give two decades ago and the 18mpg m= BMW gave a decade ago. As 
for the potential failure of Fisker, lets imagi=e how many people sailed west before the Vikings and Columbus were 
successful, an= the thousands of failures before the Wright Brothers proved that man-flight=was possible. A hundred 
and fifty years ago, most manufacturing was powered by steam engines, breakthrough were mad= and today steam 
power is obsolete while electric power trains run at speed =n excess of 200 mph. Thus the same can be true for 
automotive travel and transportation of goods. 
This week in Mone= Morning Shah Gilani wrote an article under the title — The Next Wall Street Mega-Scandal Has 
Arrived=/b> — saying that major financial institutions haven't learned a lesson as it appears that th=y are neck deep in 
another new financial scandal of global proportions, as U.S. a=d international securities regulators investigating 
manipulation of LIBOR, th= world's most important set of benchmark interest rates, have uncovered =nother price-
rigging scheme, this one in the $379 trillion market for interest rat= swaps. $379 Trillion, not Billion. Trillion. And the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has already issued subpoenas to Wall Street's=biggest banks and is 
interviewing a dozen former and current brokers from the Jerse= City, NJ, offices of ICAP Plc. For investors in the big 
banks, new revelations may put an end to the upward pu=h to the groups' stock prices, whose earnings of late have 
been helped by reductions in reserves meant as a cushion against future asset hits and litigation expenses. 
Far from being in a shady corner in the world of derivatives, interest rate swaps are a mainstream financing tool used by 
te=s of thousands of corporate treasurers worldwide. Interest rate swap prices are used to set the value of over $550 
billion of commercial real estate collateralized bonds and are used to calculate pension annuity values and benefits. 
Mega-banks primarily facilitate interest rate swaps by initially taking the other side of customers' trades and are 
responsibl= for establishing pricing of these instruments in conjunction with a handful of brokers. Similarly to how 
LIBOR is calculated, the ISDAFIX, the benchmark series of rates used to price intere=t rate swaps for U.S. dollar 
denominated swaps, is convened by a "panel" of banks. The panel, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association consists o=: Bank of America Corp., Barclays, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Credit Sui=se AG, Deutsche Bank 
AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, 
Nomura Holdin=s Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Wells Fargo & Co. 
An Easy Con in an Era of Regulation 
Not only can banks ask ICAP brokers to post whatever quote benefits the bank's internal trading book, whether it's to 
affect a=positive mark-to-market closing price for accounting and profit and loss (bonus)<=i> calculations, or manipulate 
an entry price on a new trade with a counter-pa=ty, they allegedly ask ICAP brokers to delay entry of actual transactions 
until after ISDAFIX rates are disseminated. The delay can easily create a beneficial entry price on a trade that would 
otherwise be priced based on fresh data. Manipulation of prices and r=tes has huge profit and loss and mark-to-market 
implications in terms of capital reserve ratios and other bank balance sheet metrics. 
Crocker (a former US ambassador to Iraq) advocates that to bring Iraqis f=om this current brink, the United States must 
lead a sustained, high-level diplomatic effor=, because we did it in the past, beginning in 2007; and that we must do so 
ag=in, because the stakes for Iraq and the region are far too high for anything le=s. BUT when will Crocker and neocon 
supporters understand that until the underlying issues are addressed these fixes will only be temporary? Because we 
have seen that hawkish diplomacy c=n lead to a slippery slope, as hawks will sooner or later will lose patien=e and 
demand military intervention. So we have to ask ourselves why is this our problem? If the Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish 
leaders can't resolve their differen=es, maybe Iraq's neighbors in the Arab League should take the lead. The US has 
spent more than a trillion dollars, in addition to the loss of more than 4000 American lives, with tens of thousands more 
who will need life-long assistance due t= injuries suffered in Iraq — isn't this=enough. Some wars you just have to walk 
away from and let time and others resolve the country's problems. The Russian= did this in Afghanistan and the US in
