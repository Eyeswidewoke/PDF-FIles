REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Global Partner Acquisition Corp. 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Global Partner Acquisition Corp. (the "Company"). as of 
June 5. 2015. and the related statements of operations. changes in stockholder's equity and cash flows for the 
period from May 19. 2015 (date of inception) to June 5. 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our 
audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Our audit included consideration of internal 
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over 
financial reporting. Accordingly. we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the 
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management. as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion. the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Global Partner Acquisition Corp. as of June 5. 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows 
for the period from May 19, 2015 (date of inception) to June 5, 2015, in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.
