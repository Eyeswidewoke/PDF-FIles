We agree, and by acquiring an interest in a debenture each beneficial owner of a debenture agrees, to treat 
the debentures as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the remainder of this discussion 
assumes such treatment. 
United States Holders 
Interest Income and Original Issue Discount 
It is expected. and assumed for purposes of this discussion that, subject to the discussion below, the 
debentures will not be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
Treasury regulations provide that the possibility that interest on the debentures might be deferred could 
result in the debentures being treated as issued with DID, unless the likelihood of such deferral is remote. We 
believe that the likelihood of our exercising the option to defer payment of stated interest is remote within the 
meaning of the Treasury regulations in part because our exercise of the option to defer payments of stated interest 
on the debentures would generally prevent us from: 
• 
declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on, or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or making a 
liquidation payment with respect to, any of our capital stock (which includes common and preferred 
stock); 
• 
making any payment of principal, interest or premium on or repaying, repurchasing or redeeming any 
Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures or Indebtedness Ranking Junior to the 
Debentures: or 
• 
making any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by us of any securities of any of our 
subsidiaries if such guarantee ranks paripassu with or junior in right of payment to the debentures; 
and therefore that the possibility of such deferral will not result in the debentures being treated as issued with 
OID. Accordingly, interest paid on the debentures should be taxable to a United States holder as ordinary interest 
income at the time it accrues or is received in accordance with such United States holder's method of accounting 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, no rulings or other interpretations have been issued by the IRS 
that address the meaning of the term "remote." as used in the applicable Treasury regulations, and there can be 
no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our position. 
If the possibility of interest deferral were determined not to be remote, or if interest were in fact deferred. 
the debentures would be treated as issued with OID at the time of issuance, or at the time of such deferral, as the 
case may be, and all staled interest, or if interest is in fact deferred all stated interest due after such deferral. 
would be treated as O1O. In such case, a United States holder would be required to include interest in income as 
it accrued, regardless of the holder's regular method of accounting. using the constant-yield-to-maturity method 
of accrual, before such United States holder received any payment attributable to such income, and would not 
separately report the actual cash payments of interest on the debentures as taxable income. 
Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Disposition of Debentures 
Upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of a debenture, a United States holder will 
generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized (less any accrued interest 
not previously included in the United States holder's income, which will be taxable as ordinary income) on the 
sale, exchange. redemption or other disposition and such United States holder's adjusted tax basis in the 
debenture. Assuming that interest payments on the debentures are not deferred and that the debentures are not 
treated as issued with OID. a United States holder's adjusted tax basis in a debenture generally will be its initial 
purchase price. If the debentures are treated as issued with OID. a United States holder's adjusted tax basis in a 
debenture generally will be its initial purchase price, increased by OID previously includible in such United 
States holder's gross income to the date of disposition and decreased by payments received on the debenture
