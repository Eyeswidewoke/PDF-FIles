2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
purchase "gives [the Plaintiff] title to fuel." (Id., 1157(k) (emphasis omitted).) The Plaintiff 
alleges that it relied on those statements when it continued to transact business with 
Specialty, including rolling over Specialty's debts, and that, as a result of those 
transactions, the Plaintiff lost millions of dollars. (Id., ¶ 65-66.) Furthermore, the Plaintiff 
alleges that, as a consequence of BIC's fraud, "[BIC] was able to secure millions of dollars 
worth of extended credit from [the Plaintiff] for Bunkering and BTU and secure brokerage 
commissions for itself." (Id., 1163.) The Plaintiff alleges that "[BIC] may have also lessened 
direct financial risk to itself for any credit which it may have extended to Bunkering and 
BTU during the same time period by securing for Bunkering and BTU the ability to perform 
debt service to [BIC] through the receipt of funds provided by [the Plaintiff]." (Id.) Based on 
these r30] allegations, and considering the TAC as a whole, the undersigned finds that 
the Plaintiff has satisfied the Rule 9 pleading standard. See Claybar, 54 F. Supp. 3d at 
1288 ("Examining the Second Amended Complaint in toto, the Court readily concludes that 
it adequately pleads the circumstances constituting the alleged fraud for Rule 9(b) 
purposes. . . . In light of those particularized factual allegations, no viable argument can be 
made that defendants have not been alerted to the 'precise misconduct with which they 
are charged,' . . which is, after all, the purpose of the particularity rule."). Although the 
Plaintiff failed to identify Pappaceno's location when he made the aforementioned 
statements, (see doc. 64, ¶ 57), that detail is unnecessary given that Pappaceno's 
statements were transmitted electronically and the Plaintiff alleged numerous other details 
that alert BIC to the misconduct charged. See Claybar, 54 F. Supp. 3d at 1288 n.4 ("That 
the pleading does not enumerate 'where it was made' is not fatal to the sufficiency of 
Count IV. Again, the Rule 9(b) requirement that fraud be pleaded with particularity is not a 
rigid, inflexible checklist."). 
8 SIC also argues that these statements do not constitute misrepresentations of material facts. That issue is discussed r311 
below. See infra § III C.2 
The undersigned likewise finds that the Plaintiff has met the Rule 9 pleading standard with 
respect to its suppression, deceit, and fraudulent inducement claims found in Counts IV, V 
and VI. Those fraud claims are essentially variations of the misrepresentation claim arising 
from the same events. (See doc. 64, 1174 (alleging that BIC "suppress[ed] material facts . . 
. as to (a) the true state of the financial condition of Bunkering and BTU and (b) the status 
of fuel based product serving as security or collateral"); id., ¶ 85 (alleging that BIC 
deceived the Plaintiff when it "intentionally misrepresented . 
(a) the true state of the 
financial condition of Bunkering and BTU and (b) the status of fuel based product serving 
as security or collateral"); id., ¶¶ 90-92 (alleging that BIC fraudulently induced the Plaintiff 
to continue to transact business with Specialty and roll over debts when BIC 
misrepresented (a) the true state of the financial condition of Bunkering and BTU and (b) 
the status of fuel based product serving as security or collateral").) BIC has failed to 
demonstrate how the TAC provides inadequate notice of those claims. 
2. Misrepresentation and deceit claims p32] against BIC (Counts III and V). 
The Plaintiffs misrepresentation and deceit claims are brought pursuant to sections 6-5-
101, 6-5-103, and 6-5-104 of the Code of Alabama. (Doc. 64 at 31-43, 49-55.) Section 6-5-
