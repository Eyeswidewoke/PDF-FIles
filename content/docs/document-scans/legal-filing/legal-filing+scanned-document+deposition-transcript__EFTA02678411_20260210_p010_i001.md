vaccinated (and why), and adopting implementation strategies that are tailor-made to the specific local 
conditions. 
While polio eradication is the focus of this project, like the BMFG IPI is looking to the future and the 
impact that polio vaccination campaigns can have on future healthcare initiatives. Therefore, IPI will 
make an indepth study (particularly of fragile states)to better understand the links between peace and 
health, and to generate policy support to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to health-related 
problems that negatively impact stability, and to mitigate sources of instability that negatively impact 
health. The project will build on both the BMGF and IPI's already substantial capabilities, developing a 
wide range of assets, including detailed knowledge of high-risk groups and vulnerable regions, effective 
planning and monitoring procedures, and highly trained technical staff, as well as local and regional 
technical advisory bodies. 
Furthermore, in line with the BMFG's strategy that taking risks and making non-traditional investments 
can lead to valuable program improvements, the project works by the philosophy that risky investments 
are sometimes essential to ensure that hard-won healthcare gains can be capitalized upon and 
sustained. Yet over the long-term, such investments can reduce risk. 
How this Project fits into events & developments in the field and/or relevant geographic area to 
address the identified need: 
In the case of Somalia, this project presents an unprecedented opportunity to collect data on and address 
the challenges posed to polio vaccination campaigns, as well as healthcare in general, as a consequence 
of insecurity and quickly evolving community conditions. In Somalia, the attitudes towards polio 
vaccination initiatives are the newest and freshest, representing the opportunity to study how 
community perceptions regarding polio are developed and how they can be shaped to support 
vaccination campaigns. It also allows for changing these misperceptions and reversing the trend before 
it becomes too entrenched. As such, it is imperative to act quickly. By getting in on the ground at an 
early stage and implementing a project driven by data and in-depth community insight, there is a better 
chance of stemming the tide of negative propaganda and advance the anti-polio campaign. 
Insights gained in Somalia may also be transferable to countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and 
Nigeria that are part of the existing campaign. It may also allow a shift towards a preventive approach in 
countries where similar conditions of underdevelopment, poor reach of government service delivery, 
and growing international terrorist movements may pose a further threat to the global polio eradication 
campaign. In particular, the Sahel countries of Mali, Niger, Mauritania, and Burkina Faso may become 
vulnerable to similar campaigns, as the influence of Al-Quaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which 
shares institutional links with Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab, is growing in the region. 
As a result of massive international and national efforts and funding, Pakistan was on the verge of 
complete polio eradication. However, a number of factors conspired to complicate the situation and 
increase resistance to the eradication campaign. These included external circumstances like political-
military instability, terrorism, drone attacks and resulting anti-US sentiment, a Taliban-imposed ban on 
the polio-eradication program, and the May 2013 elections which led to changes in government and 
staff. There were also internal factors, including religion-based and traditional factors, as well as 
corruption, poor infrastructure, mis- or under-reporting, and rivalries and jealousies over how polio-
related funds were to be allocated.
