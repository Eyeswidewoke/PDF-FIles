Epstein Forfeiture Options 
To inform our meeting at 3, below is a brief overview of my assessment of our options after discussing with the team 
and 
My bottom lines are: 
(1) We currently have a potentially viable action against the New York property, albeit with significant litigation 
risk. The team is exploring a potentially viable action against the VI property, but it will take additional 
investigative work. We do not have viable action against the Florida property absent further evidence. 
(2) A resolution with the Estate involving a victim compensation fund outside the forfeiture process would be most 
likely to fully compensate victims. 
(3) It is possible that even absent such a resolution, the victims would be better served by litigating directly against 
the Estate rather than our pursuing a forfeiture. 
Viability of Actions 
• 
New York: Based on my discussions with the team, it appears we trafficking offenses against 6 victims that 
involve the New York property which could potentially withstand a statute of limitations challenge: the victim 
referred to as -n
 the indictment, who was served with a grand jury subpoena in 2008 but declined to 
cooperate with law enforcement and was not interviewed, and five new victims who came forward in various 
ways after our charges were announced. 
o 
We would need to more thoroughly investigate whether the offenses against these victims could have 
been discovered by a reasonable investigation between the start of the Florida investigation and 2014. 
o The case would require the cooperation and testimony of the victims, of whom only 
had 
previously committed to testifying. Unfortunately, her counsel have already indicated that it is an open 
question if she would agree to testify in a forfeiture proceeding, and in my view hers is also the weakest 
case for SOL purposes. 
• 
Virgin Islands: The team has met with one witness who was sexually abused by Epstein at the VI property as part 
of a course of conduct that may constitute sex trafficking, although the legal analysis is not straightforward 
because the victim was not paid in exchange for specific sex acts. We have not yet had a chance to fully debrief 
her, nor has she yet committed to being willing to testify. We also have a number of photographs of nude and 
partially nude young women taken on the VI property that were seized during the search of the NY 
property. And, of course, we have the results of the VI search warrant executed this week, the evidentiary value 
of which is presently unknown. 
o 
As with the NY property, we would need to more thoroughly investigate whether the offenses against 
this victim (and any others we may be able to identify) could have been discovered by a reasonable 
investigation between the start of the Florida investigation and 2014. 
o The case would require the cooperation and testimony of the victim, who has not yet committed to 
testify. 
• 
Florida: The only trafficking offenses that involved the Florida property for which we have evidence and venue 
are those involving victims who cooperated with the original Florida investigation. I do not believe we can 
credibly argue that forfeiture based on those offenses is not time-barred.
