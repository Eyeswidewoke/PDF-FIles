Limited Partners may be admitted to the Partnership on a monthly basis or on any other date selected by 
the General Partner. Additional or substitute general partners who are affiliates of the General Partner 
may be admitted, in the sole discretion of the General Partner: provided however, that the General 
Partner shall give not less than 30 days' written notice to all Limited Partners of the proposed admission 
of any such additional or substitute general partner. In connection with the admission of a Partner to the

have identical rights except for different "Management Fees" in accordance with Section 4.03 and 
different withdrawal rights in accordance with Section 8.02. The Partnership may issue other 
series of limited partnership interests with different fee and/or withdrawal terms in the future. 
(b) At the time of any capital contribution by a Limited Partner to the Partnership, such 
Limited Partner will be required to designate whether the particular contribution is for a Series 
One, Series Two, Series Three or Series Four limited partnership interest and such designation 
shall be irrevocable and effective upon consent thereto by the General Partner in its sole 
discretion as evidenced by the General Partner executing the Partnership's Subscription 
Agreement or in such other manner as the General Partner shall determine. Series Three 
Interests were offered only to investors who entered into agreements with their brokerage firm 
pursuant to which the brokerage firm receives a fee directly from such investors at an annual rate 
of at least 0.75% with respect to their investment in the Partnership. Series Four Interests will 
only be offered to Limited Partners who invest in the Partnership through a fee-based advisory
