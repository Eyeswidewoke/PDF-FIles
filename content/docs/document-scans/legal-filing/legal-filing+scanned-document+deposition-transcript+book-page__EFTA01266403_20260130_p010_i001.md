Section 5.5. -Spendthrift Provision 
During the term of any trust hereunder, no money or other assets (either principal or 
income) payable or distributable under the provisions of this Agreement shall be pledged, 
assigned, transferred, given, conveyed, hypothecated, sold, anticipated, charged, or encumbered 
by any of the Beneficiaries hereunder, nor shall the income and principal of any trust, while in 
the poccecsion of my Trustees, be liable for any debts, contracts, obligations, or undertakings of 
such Beneficiaries, voluntary or involuntary, or for any claims or judgments against any 
Beneficiary, including claims for alimony or for the support of any Beneficiary's spouse or 
children, or for reimbursement of a federal, state or local government, or any agency of any 
federal, state, or local government, for the support of any Beneficiary hereunder, prior to the time 
such money or assets are actually paid or distributed to such Beneficiary. Any attempted pledge, 
assignment, transfer, gift, conveyance, hypothecation, anticipation, charge, or encumbrance of 
any money or assets (either income or principal) payable or distributable under the provisions of 
this Agreement by any of the Beneficiaries hereunder prior to the time such money or assets are 
actually paid or distributed to such Beneficiary shall be null and void and shall not be recognized 
by my Trustees. This Section 5.5 of Article V shall not apply to me. 
Section 5.6.- Limitation on Distribution" 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no discretionary distribution of 
income or principal of any trust hereunder shall be applied to pay for medical care, residential 
facilities, or any other care or service that would otherwise be provided for any Beneficiary 
hereunder by any federal, state, or other governmental agency; and no such discretionary 
distribution of income or principal shall be made for reimbursement for any such care, facilities 
or services previously provided. Before making any discretionary payment to or for the benefit 
of any such Beneficiary hereunder, my Trustees shall consider the amounts such Beneficiary is 
or may be entitled to receive from any governmental agency for such care, facilities, or services. 
If such amounts are available, discretionary distributions of income and principal from any trust 
hereunder shall be made only to supplement such amounts, and to provide liberally for needs and 
comforts over and above the basic maintenance, support, and medical care that may be paid for 
by any such agency. 
Section 5.7.- Division and Combination of Trusts 
A. 
For any administrative, tax or other purpose determined by my Trustees to 
be in the best interests of any Beneficiary (including any remainderman) hereunder, my Trustees 
may at any time and from time to time (whether before or after funding), without approval of any 
court, divide any trust under this Agreement into two or more separate trusts or combine two or 
more trusts with substantially identical terms (whether or not such trusts resulted from division 
of a prior trust). 
B. 
If property is directed to be added to any trust hereunder (the "Original 
Trust"), whether by the terms of this Agreement any other agreement, or the Will of any person, 
my Trustees may hold such property as one or more separate trusts on terms identical to the 
terms of the Original Trust. My Trustees may allocate such property among the separate trusts (if 
any) into which the Original Trust was divided, whether or not pro-rata, using specific assets or
