indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified 
party otherwise than under this paragraph. After notice from an indemnifying party to 
such indemnified party of its election to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying 
party will not be liable to such indemnified party pursuant to the provisions of this 
paragraph for any legal or other expense subsequently incurred by such indemnified 
party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, 
unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed counsel in accordance with the first 
sentence of this paragraph or (ii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment 
of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. No 
indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding 
effected without its prior written consent; provided, however that the indemnifying 
party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. No indemnifying 
party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry 
of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not 
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such 
indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. 
Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be 
subrogated to all rights of the indemnified party with respect to all third parties, firms or 
corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made. 
(d) 
The Investor confirms, and the Company acknowledges, that the 
information to appear in the table in the section entitled "Principal and Selling 
Shareholders" or equivalently named section in the Registration Statement under the 
headings "Name of Beneficial Owner," "Shares Beneficially Owned Prior to Offering -
Number of Shares," "Maximum Number of Shares Offered in this Offering," or 
equivalently named headings in the Registration Statement and in the footnote related to 
such information pertaining to the Investor constitute the only information concerning 
the Investor that will be furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the 
Investor for inclusion in the Registration Statement. 
(e) 
If the indemnification provided for above is held by a court of 
competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, 
liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in 
lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount 
paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage 
or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the 
indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in 
connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, 
damage or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative 
fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by 
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a 
material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by 
the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, 
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement 
or omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentations (within the meaning of 
Section 11(0 of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who 
was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Section, the Investor shall not be required to contribute any amount in
