An active trading market for the shares may not develop. It is also possible that after the offering 
the shares will not trade in the public market at or above the initial public offering price. 
In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, 
over-allotment transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. 
• Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase shares of our common stock so long as the 
stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum, and are engaged in for the purpose of 
preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock while the offering is 
in progress. 
• Over-allotment transactions involve sales by the underwriters of shares of our common stock in 
evens of the number of shares the underwriters are obligated to purchase. This creates a 
syndicate short position which may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. 
In a covered short position, the number of shares of our common stock over-allotted by the 
underwriters is not greater than the number of shares that they may purchase in the option to 
purchase additional shares. In a naked short position, the number of shares involved is greater 
than the number of shares in the option to purchase additional shares. The underwriters may 
close out any short position by exercising their option to purchase additional shares and/or 
purchasing shares in the open market. 
• Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of common stock in the open market after the 
distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the 
source of shares to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other 
things. the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared with the price 
at which they may purchase shares through exercise of the option to purchase additional shares. 
If the underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by exercise of the option to purchase 
additional shares and, therefore, have a naked short position, the position can be closed out only 
by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the 
underwriters are concerned that after pricing there could be downward pressure on the price of 
the shares in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. 
Penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member 
when the common stock originally sold by that syndicate member is purchased in stabilizing or 
syndicate covering transactions to cover syndicate short positions. 
These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect 
of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in 
the market price of our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock in the open market 
may be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. Neither we nor the 
underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the effect that the transactions described 
above may have on the price of our common stock. The underwriters are not required to engage in 
these activities. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the underwriters 
without notice at any time. These transactions may be effected on the New York Stock Exchange, in 
the over-the-counter market or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. 
Some of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, 
investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our 
affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these 
transactions. 
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriters and their affiliates 
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related 
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the 
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
