The meetings began =ith an opening session, attended by Al-Monitor, in which the ministers of rater resources from all 
three countries spoke about the prevailing spirit =f cooperation and contentment, as well as the principle of mutual 
good will and a desire to prevent harm to other=. Egypt's minister of irrigation affirmed in a speech that 
Egypt=nbsp;would not stand against development in countries of the Nile Basin, a= long as it did not adversely affect it. 
The Ethiopian minister countered that his country would not cause harm to any downstream=countries, meaning Egypt 
and Sudan. 
Attitudes quickly c=anged, however, once the closed sessions began and disagreements mounted. =s a result, the 
meetings were suspended and a new date for negotiations wa= set for Dec. 8. 
"We were taken ab=ck by Ethiopia's =ttempts to impose its agenda on us during the meetings, while it outright failed to 
recognize the international committee's recommendations pertaining to the dam. Disagreements revolved around how 
to establish a committee or =ody through which the three countries would work to implement those 
recomm=ndations," an Egyptian diplomatic source who participated in the meeting= told Al-Monitor. 
"Egypt is of the =pinion that it is necessary for Ethiopia to acknowledge that there are pro=lems associated with the dam 
and that it will have negati=e effects on Egypt. Clear c=nditions must be set, and Ethiopia must commit to abide by and 
never circu=vent them. This is why Egypt has insisted on the presence of international experts who would serve to 
validate Egypt=92s position before the international community, though Ethiopia has objec=ed to this," added the 
source who requested anonymity. 
Egyptian concerns a=out the Renaissance Dam are confined to its technical specifications, the =ize of the projected 
structure and the holding capacity of the reserv=ir attached to it, which might negatively affect the flow of water into 
Egypt and decrease the rate of electricity production at the Aswan Dam. Furthermore, Ethiopia did not submit 
sufficient=studies concerning the dam's safety and its ecological and social impact= 
"We were surprise= by Ethiopia's rejection of our proposals during the meeting. We cannot =upport the dam without 
added proof of good intentions from the Ethiopian s=de. All options are open before Egypt, if Ethiopia does not 
acquiesce to our conditions," another Egyptian sour=e present at the meetings told AI-Monitor. 
"We do not want t= characterize the negotiations as having failed. We will give ourselves an=ther chance to talk and 
better clarify everybody's points of view," Eg=pt's Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources, Mohammed Abdel 
Moteleb, further told Al-Monitor. 
Ethiopian Minister =f Water and Energy Alamayo Tegno, in a statement given to Al-Monitor =fter the meetings, said: 
"The decision to build the Renaissance Dam is r=solute, both by the government and the Ethiopian people. We are in 
complete agreement with Sudan about all the details pert=ining to the completion of the dam. Egypt will certainly come 
to understan= this and espouse our position." 
"What is currentl= taking place is a dispute and not a difference in opinion. We have repeat=dly affirmed our intention 
not to harm any other country. Financing diffic=lties will not hinder our efforts, since the Ethiopian people are mobilized 
in favor of building the dam. Ethiopia =as now become one of the world's 10 fastest-developing countries,=94 Tegno 
continued. 
Cairo is currently =ulling taking a number of quick steps prior to the second session of negot=ations scheduled for Dec. 8. 
In this regard, Egypt's political leadershi= seemed comfortable with the matter when the Egyptian Prime Minister Hazem 
el-Biblawi announced before the first se=sion was held that the Renaissance Dam could bring prosperity to Egypt. Th=s is 
in direct contrast with Egypt's stance during negotiations.<=p> 
An Egyptian diploma=ic source told Al-Monitor that Cairo's options right now revolve around =aintaining international 
pressure and preventing foreign funding of the da= project to slow construction until an agreement can be reached with
