Ellis continued, "George has made the point, along with a number of others in the community; 
that NSF needs to be more adventuresome, that we have an important role in supporting work at the 
frontiers of science. A workshop George helped organize led to a new program in our division called 
Chemical Bonding Centers that represents an effort to address this concern. " 
Perspectives on Whitesides 
George has managed to put together epochs of work that have really shaped the content of big hunks of 
chemistry. He is an intensively curious person. 
—Ralph Nuzzo, Professor at the University of Illinoislo 
By 2005, Whitesides had become one of the most visible members of the chemistry community. 
Knowles commented: 
When I first met him, George was a first-year graduate student at Caltech. He was 
somebody who not only knew all about the arcane corner of organic chemistry that I'd worked 
on; he also knew all about everything else as well. Already at that time, George was a 
marvelously eclectic man. And today, he is one of the most eclectic chemists on the planet. His 
intellectual range is quite extraordinary. His intellectual eclecticism is indeed his most 
extraordinary characteristic. He is a researcher who tackles major challenges fearlessly—a 
scientist who has always been interested in and concerned about practical applications of his 
research, an academic who has always been very interested in the world around him as well as 
(in) research projects that illuminate the underlying science. George is capable in a very 
interesting way of "shaking the cage." 
Although Whitesides was officially a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard, he 
was viewed as "a Renaissance thinker whose ideas crisscrossed scientific disciplines, and an 
outspoken critic who was fond of reminding scientists that they really understood very little."" 
Mark Skaletsky12 described Whitesides role in developing substantive solutions to the problem of 
translating academic science: "George is a drill-down thinker. He will take an idea and just keep 
working it and working it and working it. He spends more time thinking about the solution as 
opposed to just the idea." Jim Tananbaum13 described Whitesides as "extraordinarily good at 
generating creative, out-of-the-box ideas." He added, "George has a very clean and clear sense of 
whether once a problem is defined it could be technically met with what is currently available. He is 
very good at being realistic about what can be done and he is also extraordinarily clever. He is very 
good at relaxing all constraints. He is never in a box. He takes a problem and looks at it from every 
possible angle. He then generates solutions to that problem based upon the different ways of looking 
at it." 
113 Ralph Nuzzo earned his doctorate degree while a student of Whitesides at MIT; Nuzzo then worked a number of years at 
AT&T Bell Labs before moving to a full professorship at the University of Illinois.

notably Biogen Idec, Enzytech, and CelTex. 
13 Jim Tananbaum (managing director, Prospect Venture Partners), who held M.D. and MBA degrees from Harvard, was a 
cofounder with Whitesides of CelTex and Theravance.
