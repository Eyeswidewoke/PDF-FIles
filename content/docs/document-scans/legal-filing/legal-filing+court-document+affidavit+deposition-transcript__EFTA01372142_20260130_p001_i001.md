2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
The Prudential considerations — the probable outcome of a trial on the merits, the probable 
outcome of claims by other classes, and the reasonability of any provisions for attorneys' 
fees — also weigh in favor of approving the settlement. 148 F.3d at 323. As discussed, the 
Court cannot estimate the probable outcome of a trial on the merits for the N14 Class or 
for the owners of N12 vehicles because it has not yet ruled on any dispositive issues, but 
both Parties represent that they "remain confident of their chance at prevailing at trial." 
ECF No. 92 at 26-27. As the Court will discuss, the attorneys' fees sought by Plaintiffs are 
reasonable. Most relevant for the Prudential consideration, Plaintiffs represent that the 
settlement is not limited by a fixed amount -- the total amount Defendants pay will be 
determined by the claims submitted by Class members -- and the fees and expenses 
awarded to Class Counsel, along with the incentive awards granted to the Named [*57] 
Plaintiffs, will not reduce the amount available for Class members. ECF No. 92 at 29. 
The Court finds that the Prudential factors weigh in favor of approval of the settlement. 
9. Baby Prods.: the degree of direct benefit provided to the class 
The Court also considers the "degree of direct benefit provided to the class," including the 
"number of individual awards compared to both the number of claims and the estimated 
number of class members, the size of the individual awards compared to claimants' 
estimated damages, and the claims process used to determine individual awards." Baby 
Prods., 708 F.3d at 174. 
The Court repeats that 5,310 of 186,031 Class members have submitted claims. Though 
this is a relatively small percentage, but Plaintiffs and Defendants estimate that fewer than 
ten percent of Class Vehicles have actually exhibited the alleged defects, potentially 
explaining why many Class members did not submit claims. ECF No. 92 at 21. Of the 
5,310 Class members who have submitted claims, all who submit sufficient documentation 
and are eligible for awards should receive rewards; the total amount paid by Defendants to 
Class members is not limited by a fixed fund amount, nor will the attorneys' fees and costs 
or p58] awards granted to the Named Plaintiffs reduce the amount available to Class 
Members. ECF No. 92 at 29-30. This analysis favors approval of the settlement. 
After considering all of the factors, the Court finds the proposed settlement fair, 
reasonable, and accurate. 
IV. Attorneys' fees 
In the settlement, Plaintiffs agree not to seek an award of attorneys' fees and expenses in 
an amount greater than $2,320,000, and Defendants agree not to object to an award of up 
to $1,820,000. ECF No 69-3 Ex. 1 
The settlement also provides that Defendants 
will not oppose service awards of $4,000 each to the Named Plaintiffs serving as N14 
Class Representatives. Id. VIII.C. 
Plaintiffs now seek service awards for eighteen Named Plaintiffs and $2,320,000 in 
attorneys' fees and expenses. ECF No. 86. Defendants do not oppose the service awards 
but argue that the Court should award Plaintiffs only $1,820,000 in attorneys' fees and 
expenses. ECF No. 90. The Court now determines whether Plaintiffs' request is 
reasonable.
