Exit Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams 
Paul Williams, who suffered from sickle-cell disease, fell into depression because of the stress of touring 
and personal issues. By the late 1960s, he had developed a serious case of alcoholism. As his physical 
and mental health began to decline sharply, it made performing increasingly difficult. Williams began 
traveling with oxygen tanks, and the other four Temptations made valiant efforts to raid and drain his 
alcohol stashes. 
By 1969, Richard Street, lead singer of Motown act The Monitors and a former Distant, was touring with 
the group as a backup replacement for Williams. For most shows, save for his solo numbers, Williams 
would dance and lip-sync onstage to parts sung live by Street into an offstage mic behind a curtain. At 
other shows, and during most of the second half of 1970, Street substituted for Williams onstage. 
Eddie Kendricks became detached from the group after David Ruffin's firing and as the health of Paul 
Williams continued to fail. In addition, Kendricks preferred the ballad material from the earlier days and 
was uncomfortable with the psychedelic soul material the group was now performing. Kendricks 
rekindled his friendship with Ruffin, who persuaded him to go solo. Kendricks no longer felt he had a say 
in Otis Williams's handling of the group and was also convinced Motown's handling of the Temptations' 
finances was cheating the group out of money. 
Kendricks lobbied strongly in 1970 to have the Temptations go on "strike" - no performances, no 
recordings - until Berry Gordy and the Motown staff would be willing to go over all group finances with 
independent accountants.[23] Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin strongly opposed this idea, and regular 
group in-fighting between Kendricks, Otis Williams, and Franklin grew from this disagreement.[23) After 
a November 1970 Copacabana engagement, one final confrontation between the three caused 
Kendricks to walk out in-between shows and not return. Both Kendricks and Williams then agreed that 
Kendricks would be leaving the group. 
Kendricks later stated that he actually considered leaving as 
early as 1965, but remained with the Temptations and unsuccessfully attempted to get permission to 
record a solo album without leaving the group. 
Before Kendricks officially left the Temptations, he and Paul Williams recorded the lead vocals for "Just 
My Imagination (Running Away with Me)", a ballad that became Kendricks' final single with the group. 
Included on the Sky's the Limit LP along with the original album version of "Smiling Faces Sometimes", 
"Just My Imagination" was released as a single in January 1971, and the song began steadily climbing the 
U.S. pop singles chart, peaking at #1 two months later. By the time "Just My Imagination" topped the 
charts, Kendricks had negotiated his release from the group and signed a solo deal with Motown's Tamla 
label. 
The Temptations originally hired Ricky Owens, from the Los Angeles-based vocal group the Vibrations, to 
replace Kendricks. However, Owens only played two dates with the group before he was fired for 
forgetting the words to his solo numbers due to nervousness. For several weeks of the spring of 1971, 
the Temptations were without a fifth member. Owens meanwhile returned to the Vibrations and died in 
Los Angeles, California on December 6, 1996 at the age of 57.
