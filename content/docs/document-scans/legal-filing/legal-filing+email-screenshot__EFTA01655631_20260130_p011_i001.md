WKBW (ABC-7) (03/04, Staff Writer) reported that the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that 51-year-old 
Matthew Fisher, a former administrator at the Gow School in South Wales, has pleaded guilty to the 
production of child pornography. The article added that according to the U.S. Attorney's Office, between 
June 2022 and November 2023, Fisher lived on campus while employed at the Gow School, and he used 
hidden cameras to create and attempt to create videos of at least five minor males engaged in sexually 
explicit conduct. Investigators said they seized several of Fisher's electronic devices and found child 
pornography depicting the five minor males and other yet-to-be-identified minor individuals. A DOJ press 
release noted that the plea is the result of an investigation by the FBI, Child Exploitation Task Force, under 
the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Matthew Miraglia. 
FBI Files Shed Some Light on Shanquella Robinson Investigation 
WSOC (ABC-9) (03/04, Bruno) reported that the FBI is starting to release files in response to multiple 
Freedom of Information Act requests by the reporting outlet dating back to 2023. The FBI released two 
parts of documents related to the Shanquella Robinson investigation. The agency is continuing to search 
for responsive records and more may be released in the coming months. The article mentioned 
that Shanquella Robinson went to Cabo, Mexico, in 2022 with six people she considered friends. She 
never returned home. Her father says her travel-mates told him she died of alcohol poisoning. An autopsy 
in Mexico claimed she died of neck and spinal cord injuries. A video also surfaced of Robinson being 
attacked by someone on the trip. The article noted that about a month after she died, FBI records show 
they spoke to a person, whose name was redacted from the file, who referenced that fight and said, 
"They aren't sure what happened." But the unknown person claimed Robinson's friends said she was 
drinking and "hit her head on the toilet?' The documents say the person also told investigators they saw 
pictures of Robinson's body and said, "There are bruises on her and she looks like she was stomped on:' 
The person also believed there were cameras in the house. A lot of the information is still being protected 
by the FBI and was redacted in the files. That includes interviews with people who said they had 
information about the case and social media accounts associated with her travel-mates. The FBI kept 
track of all of their social media accounts from Dropbox to Twitter. The article added that the FBI files say 
agents searched Robinson's phone. What they found in the phone is redacted. The files also state that in 
November 2022, authorities in Mexico told the FBI they needed to interview someone on the trip so they 
could get a temporary detention order. Mexican prosecutors eventually would issue an arrest warrant, 
but no one was ever extradited. The Robinson family is suing all of the travel-mates, including the person 
they say is seen hitting Robinson in the video. Court records show she changed her name and now lives in 
Connecticut.
