Cohen has said in court that he had only three legal clients during the past year: Broidy, Trump and talk-show host 
Sean Hannity. He gave seven others "strategic advice and business consulting." 
Last month Cohen said he borrowed from his home-equity credit line to make a $130,000 payment in October 2016 to 
Stormy Daniels, an adult-film star who says she had sex with Trump. 
In a Thursday morning appearance on "Fox & Friends," =rump distanced himself from Cohen, saying he did only "a 
tiny, tiny little fraction" of Trump's legal work, but it included representation "on this crazy Stormy Daniels deal." 
Russian Interference 
Cohen is under investigation for bank fraud and violating campaign-finance law. But his decade at Trump's side as his 
lawyer and enforcer could yield information he might trade to investigators looking into the Trump campaign and 
Russia's interference in the U.S. election. 
Still, if he chooses to defend himself, Cohen does have assets. Companies he signs for own two investment properties 
purchased in 2015. The larger one, with 92 units on New York's Upper East Side, is 38 percent owned by Cohen's 
companies. The businesses also appear to be the sole owner of a downtown building with 20 units. 
Together they likely generate less than $1 million in annual net income for Cohen's companies after accounting for 
partner interests, expenses and financing costs, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Debt against the buildings is low, 
meaning that Cohen could tap them for cash. Last October, the Cohens sold a unit at Trump World Tower, near the 
United Nations, for 
$3.3 million. 
Cohen has been a savvy property investor. He previously owned four buildings in need of repairs in Lower Manhattan, 
rehabilitated them and sold them for $32 million in 2014, more than doubling his initial investment. 
'Cautious, Methodical' 
Richard Guarino, a partner at Friedman-Roth Realty, has worked with Cohen on a handful of deals, including the 
purchase of his Upper East Side building. As a real estate investor, Cohen is "cautious, methodical, smart and, I think, 
conservative," Guarino says. 
Cohen's current business partners are a family of New York real estate lawyers headed by Herbert Chaves. The family, 
having just sold a plot of Brooklyn land to a partnership including the family company of Jared Kushner, were looking to 
reinvest their gains when they bought Cohen's Lower Manhattan buildings in 2014. Months later, they partnered with 
Cohen to buy the Upper East Side property, 330 East 63rd Street. Guarino, a broker on the deal, says he dealt only with 
Cohen, who served as a representative for the investor group even though the Chaves family companies hold the 
majority stake. 
Purchased for $58 million, the squat, brown-brick seven- story building has only a $17 million mortgage, meaning 
Cohen's share has at least $15 million of equity he could borrow against if his partners allowed him to do so. Another 
property at 133 Avenue D, not previously reported to be owned by Cohen, has at least $5 million of equity not tapped by 
a mortgage. But more debt means more risk and could hurt Cohen later if the taxi business doesn't turn around to help 
cover higher interest payments. 
Park Avenue 
One property that may prove harder to extract cash from: 
Cohen's palatial Park Avenue home. Purchased for $5 million in 2005, the sprawling 10th-floor unit used to be three 
separate apartments and has four bedrooms. It could be worth $8 million or more, based on comparable sales. 
In late 2015, the Cohens moved the property into a type of trust designed to limit tax exposure when transferring 
property to heirs. The trust structure has tax consequences for typical mortgages, but those could be dodged if the 
Cohens took out an interest-only loan. 
In February 2016, Laura Cohen, in her role as a trustee of the new entity, did just that, taking out a revolving $500,000 
home-equity line of credit against the property from First Republic Bank. It was the first time the family had borrowed 
against the property since a loan of more than $2 million 11 years earlier when they bought it, property records show.
