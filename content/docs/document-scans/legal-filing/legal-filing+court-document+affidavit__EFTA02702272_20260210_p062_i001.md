the same terms as the preferred securities so long as such successor securities rank the same as the 
preferred securities rank in priority with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, 
redemption and otherwise; 
• 
we expressly appoint a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the 
property trustee as the holder of the corresponding subordinated debt securities;

of issuance, on any national securities exchange or other organization on which the preferred securities 
are then listed or traded, if any:

not cause the preferred securities, including any successor securities, to be downgraded by any 
nationally recognized statistical rating organization;

not adversely affect the rights. preferences and privileges of the holders of the preferred securities,

• 
prior to such merger, conversion, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or 
lease, we have received an opinion from independent counsel to the trust experienced in such matters to 
the effect that (a) such merger, conversion, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, 
transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the 
preferred securities, including any successor securities, in any material respect, and (b) following such 
merger, conversion, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, neither 
the trust nor any successor entity will be required to register as an "investment company" under the 
Investment Company Act; and 
• 
we or any permitted successor or assignee own all of the common securities of such successor entity 
and guarantee the obligations of such successor entity under the successor securities at least to the 
extent provided by the preferred securities guarantee. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing. the trust shall not, except with the consent of holders of 100% in liquidation 
amount of the preferred securities, consolidate. amalgamate. merge with or into, convert into, or be replaced by 
or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other entity or permit any
