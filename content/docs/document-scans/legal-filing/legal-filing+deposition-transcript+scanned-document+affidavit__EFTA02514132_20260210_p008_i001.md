Again, I don't know why you brought this up at all, but more genera=ly, don't understand why you are persisting with 
this correspondence.=C20 As I've written several times, and shouldn't have to say, I=E204>ve worked hard all my life, 
set aside ample funds to ensure that my children and their families will be well taken care of, and think I have the right 
to spend my last years in peace and tranquility without being concerned with accounting for financial matters. I don't 
understand, but wil= respond to your letter. I'll also send a separate letter concerning s=me recent interchanges with 
Max, which you may or may or not have heard someth=ng about. 
I should say that your letter is not easy for me to read, and a response won't be easy to write, for reasons I've explained 
in earlier lette=s. In the first place, to repeat again, I'm amazed that we are having this correspondence at all, that we've 
wasted 5 minutes on this. I als= continue to be perplexed about the difference of style: I write you persona= letters, and 
when you respond to them (usually you don't, as in the pre=ent case), the letters read as though they are written by 
lawyers in an adversarial proceeding. On the matter of the loan to buy the Cambridge apartment, for example, I 
explained that the whole idea of a loan within a family seemed to me utterly surreal, and I agreed only because I 
assumed, mistaken=y, that the loan was for a few weeks until the Lexington house would be sold and would cover the 
costs of the apartment. If I had been paying attention, I would have known that I didn't own the Lexington house.O=A0 
If I had had a lawyer and financial adviser who were concerned with my situation, they would have informed me that the 
Lexington house was not mine, and since I had no funds to pay for a new place to live, I couldn'=t afford to buy an 
apartment in Cambridge near Harvard Square, surely not a coop with continual fees. That's what I explained in my 
let=er. Your response was a statement of the legal issues as you understood them and advice to have lawyers clarify the 
matter. 
Same now. I wrote you several long personal letters, and this is your first response. Virtually a legal document. And I 
have to say I'm surprised that you have the information you include, which h=ppens to be incorrect in crucial respects as 
I explained in earlier letters and will repeat. 
In particular, your account of the sale of the Lexington house and the purchase of the apartment is incorrect, as I have 
just reviewed once again.=C2. The facts are as I have already described them, entirely unlike the story you present 
here, which I presume you received from Max and Sam. 
Some of your letter is correct. I did not consult with lawyers before we decided to marry -- I won't comment further on 
this. And it is true that the earlier estate planning did not take into account that I might marry, a fact that has been 
causing some remarkable actions. I won't comment on this either, but will simply add below a letter I wr=te to you 
some time ago but never sent. 
You state, correctly, that it would be wrong for Valeria to end up as your tenant. But then right below you say that the 
preferred solution was for the apartment we bought to be in a trust of which you are the benef=ciaries, which means 
that she would end up as your tenant. That aside, why should the apartment have been in a trust at all? <=font> 
As I wrote you several times, we are very happy together. Valeria gave up her family, friends, and a flourishing 
professional career to be with me — a very precious gift. I want to make sure that she =s well taken care of when I die, 
not beholden to anyone, not anyone's=tenant. 
About the "scam," yes, there is one, and I have described it to you several times. To repeat again: the mandatory annual 
withdrawa= from the IRA is about $300,000, which certainly does sound like a lot of money, until we look at what was 
happening to it. About half went to distributions to the family. The remaining half was spent in taxes and management 
fees for the entire estate. Over and above this were the payments for Wellfleet and Alex's medical expenses, all drawn 
from the IRA in excess of the mandatory withdrawal and therefore subject to exorbitant taxes. That's before one cent 
was used for personal expenses.0=A0 If I had had a lawyer/financial adviser, he would have informed me that this is 
going to quickly deplete the IRA. But I didn't. I f=nally learned about it and ended it. 
You say that my expenditures have gone up since then. Since you seem to have gotten information about my expenses, 
could you explain how they went up? I can give you some hints. We were, for example, payin= tens of thousands of
