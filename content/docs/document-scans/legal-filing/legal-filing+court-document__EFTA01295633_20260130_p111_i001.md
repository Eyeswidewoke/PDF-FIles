2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
Apparel the Court considered a motion for strnmary judgment and determined whether the plaintiff had produced substantial 
evidence swooning the elements of its fraud claim. Dewitt Apparel, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8593. at '21. Thus: the Court's 
analysis in Dewitl Apparel is not applicable to the determination of whether the r41] Plaintiff in this case has failed to state a 
claim. 
15 The undersigned also notes that, even if the Plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege a material misrepresentation of fact. the 
Plaintiffs deceit claim would still survive based on the allegations that BIC suppressed information regarding Specialty's 
financial condition with the intent to mislead the Plaintiff. (doc. 64. Q¶ 79-88). See § 6-5-103 (Were concealment of such a fact. 
unless done in such a mamer as to deceive and mislead, will not support an action!): § 6-5-104 ("A deceit within the meaning 
of this section (includes) . . . [tlhe suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it"); Whitlow. 567 So. 2d at 1241 ("An 
action for deceit . . . results from . .. a suppression of material facts with an intent to mislead."). 
3. Fraud in the inducement claim against BIC, BTU and Brito (Count VI). 
The Defendants all argue that the Plaintiffs fraud in the inducement claim should be 
stricken or dismissed for being redundant of the Plaintiffs misrepresentation and deceit 
claims. (Doc. 65 at 16; doc. 67-1 at 5.) First, the undersigned notes that the Defendants 
improperly seek the dismissal of Count VI on redundancy grounds. "[M]otions to dismiss 
made under Rule 12(b)(6) only test the validity of ["42] a claim, not its redundancy; a 
redundant claim should not be dismissed as long as it is valid." tMchael v. Wal-Mart Stores 
East, LP, No. 6:14-cv-579-Orl-40DAB, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153908, 2014 WL 5502442, 
at *2 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 30, 2014) (citing Bangkok Crafts Corp. v. Capitolo Di San Pietro in 
Vaticano, No. 03 Civ. 15(RWS), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42639, 2007 WL 1687044, at '10 
(S.D.N.Y. June 11, 2007)); see id. (finding that a duplicative negligence claim cannot be 
dismissed for being redundant). Thus, the Defendants' motions with respect to Count VI 
are properly understood as motions to strike pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). Rule 12(f) 
provides that "Mlle court may° strike from a pleading . . . any redundant, immaterial, 
impertinent, or scandalous matter." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) (emphasis added). 
The purpose of a motion to strike is to clean up the pleadings. streamline litigation, and avoid unnecessary forays into 
immaterial matter. A court wit not exercise its discretion under the rule to strike a pleading unless the matter sought to 
be omitted has no possible relationship to the controversy. may confuse the issues. or otherwise prejudice a party. 
Because striking a portion of a pleading is a drastic remedy and because it often is sought by the movant simply as a 
dilatory tactic, motions under Rule 12(f) are viewed with disfavor and are inlrequenth, granted. 
Principal Bank v. First American Mortgage, Inc., No. 2:10-cv-190-FtM-29DNF, 2014 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 41001, 2014 WL 1268546, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 27, 2014) ['43] (intemal 
citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted)); see also TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. Zip 
Wireless Products, Inc., 716 F. Supp. 2d 1275, 1290 (N.D. Ga. 2010) ("Rule 12(f) reflects 
the inherent power of the Court to prune down pleadings so as to expedite the 
administration of justice and to prevent abuse of its process. Motions to strike are generally 
viewed with disfavor and are often considered time wasters. A motion to strike is a drastic 
remedy to be resorted to only when required for the purposes of justice . . . and should be 
granted only when the pleading to be stricken has no possible relation to the controversy." 
(internal citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted)). Indeed, stated more succinctly, 
"(i]n addressing a Motion to Strike, 'a court will not exercise its discretion . . unless the 
matter sought to be omitted has no possible relationship to the controversy, may 
confuse the issues, or otherwise prejudice a party."' Hepp v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., No. 
8:13-CV-02836-EAK-TBM, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107393, 2014 WL 3865389, at '7 (M.D. 
Fla. Aug. 5, 2014) (emphasis supplied); see also Tracfone Wireless, Inc. v. Access
