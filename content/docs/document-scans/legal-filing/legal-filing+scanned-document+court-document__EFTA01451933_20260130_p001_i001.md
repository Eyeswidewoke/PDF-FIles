not have occurred or been entered into at the date that this Memorandum is made available but which the Manager 
expects will occur or be entered into thereafter. For example, this Memorandum makes reference to the Manager being 
authorised by the FCA to the extent required by the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and its 
implementing legislation in the UK (the 'AIFM Authorisation'). Although the Manager has applied for the AIFM 
Authorisation. as of the date of this Memorandum, the Manager has not yet received the AIFM Authorisation. The legal 
structure required to conduct the activities of the Fund and all applicable regulatory and other clearances. if any, will have 
been implemented or obtained (as applicable) prior to the date on which Investors are first admitted to the Fund (the 
"First Closing'). 
Certain information included in this Memorandum has been compiled from publicly available sources. The Manager has 
taken reasonable care to ensure that such information has been correctly and properly extracted or compiled and is 
correctly and fairly reproduced and presented. but while such sources are believed to be reliable, such information has 
not been independently verified and the Manager does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness 
of such information. 
Certain information contained in this Memorandum constitutes forward-looking statements and statements of opinion 
and/or belief, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology including, without limitation, words such 
as "may', "will', "seek', "should". 'expect'. "anticipate', 'project', 'estimate', 'intend". 'continue' or 'believe' or the 
negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Any such forward-looking statements (including, 
without limitation, projections of future earnings or value) and statements of opinion and/or belief contained herein 
represent the Managers own assessment and interpretation of information available to it as at the date of this 
Memorandum (or at such other date as specified herein) and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and 
other factors (many of which are beyond the Manager's control) which may cause actual results to be materially different 
from those contemplated in such statements. No representation is made or assurance given that such statements are 
correct, or that the objectives of the Fund will be achieved. Investors must determine for themselves what reliance (if 
any) they should place on such statements and the Manager accepts no responsibility in respect thereof. In making an 
investment decision, Investors must rely on their own examination of the Fund and the terms of this offering, including 
the merits and risks involved. 
In considering the purchase of Interests and reviewing the past performance information contained in this Memorandum. 
Investors should bear in mind that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. In particular, current

respect of prior performance data may have been based) or those that may exist in the future. Such differences may
