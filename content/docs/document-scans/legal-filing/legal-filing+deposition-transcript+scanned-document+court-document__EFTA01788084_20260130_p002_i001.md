"They demonstrate a remarkable proof of principle that tumor cells from one animal can be manipulated to produce 
factors that can inhibit the growth of cancers in other animals," Dr. Parnes says. "This suggests that these cancer 
inhibitory factors have been conserved over millions of years of evolution." 
Supporting this research is neither a big drug company nor a biotechnology startup. In a highly unusual set-up, 
Metromedia Co., the privately held broadcast and telecommunications company run by billionaire John Kluge until his 
death in September, is financially backing it. 
The company's Metromedia Biosciences unit has put $50 million into the cancer project and intends to funnel the bulk 
of any revenue from the treatment should it reach the market into Mr. Kluge's charitable foundation. 
The company is now developing a way to manufacture the beads on a large scale, says Stuart Subotnick, president of 
Metromedia and chief executive of the biosciences business. 
Cancer is often described as a process of uncontrolled growth, but even tumor cells reach a point where when they're 
surrounded by enough similar cells, growth regulators kick in and instruct them to stop proliferating. The new strategy is 
based in part on that premise. 
Dr. Smith and his colleagues believe the proteins secreted by the encapsulated tumor cells trick the patient's actual 
tumor cells into sensing similar cells are nearby. 
The beads initially contain about 150,000 mouse kidney cancers mixed=20 with agarose and wrapped with a layer of 
agarose that creates a shell. They are incubated in a culture where within days, 99% of the tumor cells die, Dr. Smith 
says. Those that remain have characteristics of cancer stem cells. They recolonize the beads within a few weeks. 
"They reach a stable state in which there is cell division and cell death," Dr. Smith says. They are producing inhibitory 
factors that regulate their growth. 
In the human studies, the beads, about the size of a pea, are implanted in the abdominal cavity. The number is 
determined by body weight, but typically involves 550 and 750 beads per treatment. The hypothesis is that in the body, 
the inhibitory factors are secreted by the beads, picked up by the bloodstream and detected by tumor cells outside the 
bead. Researchers believe the treatment effect begins to wane after about four months; retreatment is possible. 
In the research being published Tuesday, Dr. Smith and his colleagues reported that in mice implanted with tumors, 
treatment with the cancer beads resulted 30 days later in tumors that were 30% to 60% smaller than tumors in 
untreated mice. 
Among 54 dogs and cats, whose cancers occurred naturally, treatment with the beads was associated with longer-than-
expected survival and in some cases, near-eradication of tumors. There wasn't a control group in the treatments 
involving dogs and cats, pets that had failed conventional treatment and whose owners agreed to try the experimental 
technique. 
In one group of 11 dogs with prostate cancer that were treated with the beads, the median survival from diagnosis was 
177 days, or nearly six months, compared to an expected survival of less than 50 days. One of the dogs lived for more 
than two years. A cat with breast cancer who received four treatments with the beads lived eight years after the initial 
diagnosis before dying of the disease. 
"The lab data looks very compelling," says Daniel P. Petrylak, director of the prostate-cancer program at Columbia 
University Medical Center. He wasn't involved in the basic research and says he was initially skeptical of the approach. 
Now he plans to enroll prostate cancer patients in the phase-two study. "The real question is whether this is going to 
translate into patients," he says. 
Dr. Smith says research so far indicates more than 700 different proteins or small proteins called peptides are secreted 
by the beads, including 25 to 30 that are known to have anti-tumor effects. 
Among those are factors that turn up processes that promote cell death and reduce a cell's ability to induce formation of 
blood vessels needed to survive, Dr. Smith says. 
Cancer researchers increasingly use a cocktail of chemotherapy and other so-called targeted therapies to disrupt the 
redundant systems many tumors have that enable them to evade or bounce back from the initial treatments. 
"What we think we're doing is inhibiting the tumor's ability to do its normal thing from several different directions," Dr. 
Smith says. 
Researchers hope data from the 30-patient early stage study will be pr=sented later this year.
