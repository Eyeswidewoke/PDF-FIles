Section 7: Risk Factors 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund W. LP 
well as UK tax evasion. It is a complete defense if the body corporate or partnership has reasonable procedures in place 
designed to prevent persons associated with it from committing tax evasion facilitation offences. 
The Manager intends to (i) implement reasonable procedures to prevent associated persons from committing criminal 
facilitation of tax evasion, and (n) consider the offence in respect of the Fund's investments. It is nevertheless possible 
that an English court would not find these procedures reasonable and the Manager could be found guilty of this criminal 
offence and subject to unlimited financial penalties. 
Co-investment risks, counterparty risks and investments via other entities 
The Fund may make investments via other entities and in a joint venture, co-investment or partnership arrangement with 
other parties. This may involve alternative investment vehicles (where the Fund may cause the Investors to transfer a 
portion of their Commitments to such entities), partnerships, joint ventures, companies, trusts or other entities. Such 
arrangements may involve additional risks (such as the risk that the Manager will not be as familiar with the operation of 
such entities, or the risk of higher costs associated with their formation, structuring or operation, or relationships with 
co-venturers deteriorating) and the Fund's investment via such entities may be impacted by other parties if made on a 
joint venture, co-investment or partnership basis (e.g., where a co-venturer, co-investor or partner defaults on its funding 
obligations, or is in a position to take action contrary to the Fund's objectives due to having economic or business 
interests or goals that are not consistent with those of the Fund, or where the Fund is liable for actions of such 
co-venturer, co-investor or partner). Additionally, to the extent that a co-venturer, co-investor or partner operates a 
project. the Fund will bear the risk of actions or omissions by such co-venturer, co-investor or partner. While the 
Manager will seek to limit the extent to which such factors can affect the Fund, such actions or omissions may not be 
sufficient to protect the Fund from loss. There is a risk that co-venturers, co-investors, partners or counterparties may 
default on their contractual obligations to the Fund or the Fund's investments. My such default would likely have an 
adverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments and on the returns to Investors. In addition, the Fund may co-
invest with other parties through partnerships. joint ventures or other entities. Under such circumstances. there is the 
possibility that the entity in which the Fund's investment is made or such co-investor may have economic or business 
interests or goals that are not entirely consistent with those of the Fund. In addition, the Fund may, in certain 
circumstances, be liable for actions of its co-investors. 
Dilution from subsequent closings 
Investors subscribing for Interests after the First Closing will participate in existing investments of the Fuld, diluting the 
interest of existing Investors therein. 
Although such Investors will contribute their pro rata share of prior Fund 
drawdowns (plus interest), there can be no assurance that this payment will reflect the fair value of the Fund's existing 
investments at the time such additional Interests are subscribed for. 
Indemnification 
The Fund will indemnify. and hold harmless. the General Partner. the Second GP. the Manager, the U.S. Adviser and 
each of their respective affiliates who have acted directly or indirectly on behalf of the Fund; each of the current and 
former officers. directors, employees, managers. agents of any of the General Partner, the Second GP. the Manager, the 
U.S. Adviser and each of their respective affiliates who have acted directly or indirectly on behalf of the Fund: each 
person serving, or who has served, as a member of the Fund Advisory Committee (and, with respect to claims or 
damages arising out of or relating to such service only, the Investor that such person represents and each of such 
Investor's officers, directors, employees, partners, members, managers, agents and other representatives), and any 
other third party designated by the General Partner as a covered person who serves at the request of the General 
Partner or the Manager directly or indirectly on behalf of the Fund from and against any liabilities. actions, proceedings. 
claims, costs, demands and expenses to which they may become subject by reason of their activities on behalf of the 
Fund. unless such liabilities. actions. proceedings, claims. costs, demands and expenses result from certain conduct of 
such indemnified person as specified in the Fund Partnership Agreement. Indemnification of these indemnified persons 
may impair the financial condition of the Fund and its ability to acquire investments or otherwise achieve its investment 
objective or meet its obligations. Furthermore, the Investors may be required to return certain distributions for the 
purpose of satisfying any claim under such indemnity, subject to certain limitations.
