and operated properly, could materially enhance the overall customer experience. This culture is further 
evidenced by a host of competing initiatives surrounding downtown revitalization efforts and other 
rumored efforts at economic development which are all aimed at the same result however without clear 
coordination. 
In the case of YHG in particular, the dramatic effect of these conflicts and lack of island wide berthing 
strategy has resulted in an artificial lack of high value foot traffic through the property, the life force of 
any retail market. It has driven the rents through the floor, resulted in the failure of many retail tenants, 
and has materially compromised the value of YHG and the Territory's ability to leverage YHG 
(consistently voted the Caribbean's premier shopping destination). Properly positioned and coordinated 
with other properties, YHG could provide a unique competitive advantage to all of St. Thomas when 
marketing to either bring additional cruise ships to the Territory or to justify a higher rate structure. 
Unfortunately, despite its unique beauty, retail and dining experiences, YHG cannot lure new branded 
tenants to the property as these conflicts are well known throughout the retail community. Therefore, 
despite having a world class collection of shops and dedicated infrastructure unseen on most competing 
islands, the property ultimately failed to generate cash flows adequate to succeed and the property has 
been supported by significant equity contributions from IGY. IGY/YHG have stuck by both the project 
and BPPR by having provided, over time, an additional approximately $50 million of equity beyond its 
initial investment. IGY continues to shoulder the responsibility of working to make this project prosper, 
but its efforts continue to be thwarted by the situation at hand. 
We believe that in light of these conflicts and the failure to capitalize on the many potential synergies 
from Crown Bay to WICO that many island retailers, including YHG, have simply been forced to play a 
zero sum game approach to the entire cruise ship industry. Rather than viewing the entire harbor as 
single integrated commercial and retail offering which far surpasses the offerings of any other destination 
(including St. Maarten) and is a material advantage to increase market share of total Caribbean passengers 
and total per passenger spend, private resources are spent in attempts to further fragment an already 
confusing marketplace. Jr is our ambition to work with the USVI Government to start to remedy this 
siniarion 
IV. 
Capital Market Challenges 
We understand that WICO has several financial and development commitments to satisfy. However the inability 
to fully leverage WICO's assets as set forth above are an impediment to WICO's accessing the capital markets in 
any meaningful way. 
A. Existing IP7C0 Loon Fneilt / PILOT 0 Option. We understand that WICO is presently in debt to Banco 
Popular de Puerto Rico ('BPPR') pursuant to a senior secured facility in the current principle amount of 
approximately $22 million. The facility matures in 2018. We understand that the facility is secured by 
WICO's leaseholds (including the ground leases to YHG) and its gross revenues. WICO has indicated 
publicly that it is in default to the government of the USVI in connection with 7 years of PILOT 
payments (discussed above) which should prime all other balance sheet liabilities of WICO resulting in the 
$22 mm of debt owing to BPPR being subordinated to the $5 million in delinquent PILOT payments. 
Based on cash flow projections provided by WICO and based on its present operations, the operating 
cash flow generated by the company would appear to be inadequate to service the existing BPPR debt on 
a current basis. WICO has no present way to satisfy this obligation. It is our understanding that while the 
Governor of the USVI has the authority to settle the past due amounts, only an act of the legislature of 
the USVI can modify the amount and form of the annual PILOT payments. Clearly we need more 
information on this front. 
B. 
WICO's Derelopment Commitments. We understand that WICO has accepted reservations with several cruise 
ship lines in anticipation of completing a 125' extension of the existing pier, replacing several existing 
bollards and repairing some erosion of the northern end of the pier at the apron. The extension, 
replacement and repairs are to be completed by November of 2013. The cost of such work is said to
