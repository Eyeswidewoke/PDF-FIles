2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93633, * 
On June 30, 2010, North Shore Real Estate Corporation ("North Shore") filed a notice of 
appeal from the May 26, 2010, judgment of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the 
District of the Virgin Islands (the "Bankruptcy Division"), and the June 9, 2010, order of the 
Bankruptcy Division denying North Shore's motion for reconsideration. On July 9, 2010, 
the Court entered an Order stating that: 
Appellant shall, not later than 10 days after the date of this Order, file and serve on the other parties the designation of 
record and statement of the issues to be presented. m failing which the Appeal may be dismissed for failure to

transcript, within 15 days after the transcript is filed. whichever comes later 
(Order 1-2, July 9, 2010, ECF No. 2). 
North Shore did not file a designation of record nor a statement of the issues within the 
time provided in the July 9, 2010, order. North Shore did not file its brief within the time 
provided in the order. 
On March 9, 2011, North Shore filed a motion for leave to file an untimely designation of 
record, statement of issues, and brief. North Shore attached to its motion a designation of 
record and statement of issues. North Shore did not attach a brief. 
Subsequently, James P. Carroll, Chapter 7 Trustee ("Carroll"), filed a motion to dismiss 
this matter for lack of prosecution. North Shore did not file an opposition. 
On March 28, 2012, this Court entered an order stating that: 
North Shore shall, not later than April 2, 2012, file and serve on James P. Carroll the designation of record and a 
statement of issues to be presented. failing which this appeal may be dismissed NI for failure to prosecute... 
... North Shore's brief shall, not later than April 10, 2012, be filed and served on James P. Carroll, failing which this 
appeal may be dismissed for failure to prosecute... 
(March 28, 2012, Order 3-4, ECF No. 8). 
The Court found as moot the motions filed by North Shore and Carroll. 
North Shore did not file a designation of record nor a statement of the issues within the 
time provided in the March 28, 2012, order. North Shore did not file its brief within the time 
provided in the order. 
Carroll now moves again for dismissal of this appeal for lack of prosecution. North Shore 
has not filed an opposition.
