S-1/A 
A common stock, as gain from the sale or exchange of such shares. 
Dividends effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, attributable to a U.S. 
permanent establishment) of a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax if the non-U.S. holder complies 
with applicable certification and disclosure requirements. Instead, such dividends generally will be subject to U.S. federal income 
tax on a net income basis, in the same manner as if the non-U.S. holder were a resident of the United States. A non-U.S. holder 
that is a corporation may be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified 
by an applicable income tax treaty) on its "effectively connected earnings and profits," subject to certain adjustments. 
Gain on Sale or Other Disposition of Our Class A Common Stock 
In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or, subject to the discussion below under the 
heading "Information Reporting and Backup Withholding" and "Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act; withholding tax on any gain 
realized upon the sale or other disposition of our Class A common stock unless: 
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. holder within the United States and, if 
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of the non-U.S. holder; 
the non-U.S. holder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of 
disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied; or 
• we are or have been a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time within the 
shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition and the non-U.S. holder's holding period and certain 
other conditions are satisfied.

Gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States generally will be subject to 
U.S. federal income tax, net of certain deductions, at regular U.S. federal income tax rates. If the non-U.S. holder is a foreign 
corporation, the branch profits tax described above also may apply to such effectively connected gain. An individual non-U.S. 
holder who is subject to U.S. federal income tax because the non-U.S. holder was present in the United States for 183 days or 
more during the year of sale or other disposition of our Class A common stock will be subject to a fiat 30% tax on the gain derived 
from such sale or other disposition, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
We must report annually to the Internal Revenue Service and to each non-U.S. holder the amount of dividends paid to. and 
the tax withheld with respect to, each non-U.S. holder. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was 
reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. Copies of this information also may be made available under the provisions of a 
specific treaty or agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. 
U.S. backup withholding tax (currently, at a rate of 28%) is imposed on certain payments to persons that fail to furnish the 
information required under the U.S. information reporting rules. Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder generally will be exempt from 
backup withholding if the non-U.S. holder provides a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or otherwise 
establishes an exemption. 
Under U.S. Treasury regulations, the payment of proceeds from the disposition of our Class A common stock by a non-U.S. 
holder effected at a U.S. office of a broker generally will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding, unless the 
beneficial owner, under penalties of perjury, certifies, among other things, its status as a non-U.S. holder or otherwise establishes 
an exemption. The payment of proceeds from the disposition of our Class A common stock by a non-U.S. holder effected at a non-
U.S. office of a broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding and information reporting, except as noted below. In the 
case of proceeds from a disposition of our Class A common stock by a non-U.S. holder effected at a non-U.S. office of a broker 
that is: 
• a U.S. person: 
• a `controlled foreign corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
