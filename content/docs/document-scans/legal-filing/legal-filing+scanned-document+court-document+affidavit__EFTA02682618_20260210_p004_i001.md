Curriculum Vitae 
Mark Judc Tramo. April 2009 
• Experiments on auditory perception by stroke patients that corrected a 25-year old misconception, set 
forth by Neff and colleagues in the 1975 Handbook of Sensory Physiology, and hitherto widely held by 
auditory physiologists, psychologists, and audiologists, that auditory cortex is neither necessary nor 
sufficient for simple pitch discrimination and loudness discrimination (Tramo 1990; Tramo et al. 2002: 
Dykstra et al. 2008). 
• Experiments on auditory perception by split-brain and stroke patients and event-related potential 
experiments on auditory perception by normal adults that elucidated (a) the functional role of auditory 
cortex in complex-pitch, harmony, and timbre perception: (b) the neuroanatomical dissociability of conical 
mechanisms mediating the perception of harmony in its vertical vs. horizontal dimensions in the presence 
vs. absence of tonal context; and (c) the location of interhemispheric auditory projections in the human 
corpus callosum (Tramo et al. 1987. I 990. I991,1993,2005.2008ab; Tramo & Bharucha 1991; Tramo 
& Koelsch 2008); 
• Experiments on the neural coding of tonal harmony via intra-axonal and extracellular microelectrode 
recordings of cat auditory nerve and inferior colliculus responses to complex-tones that: (a) elucidated 
peripheral and central representations of tonal consonance and dissonance; and (b) provided a biologically-
based alternative to Helmholtz's counterintuitive theory, shared by many auditory physiologists and 
psychologists for more than a century, that the consonance of isolated musical intervals and chords is a 
negative percept. derived from the absence of tonal roughness; our neural data provide empirical evidence 
that consonance is a positive percept. built up from multiple. harmonically-related pitches, in keeping with 
the music-theoretic formulations of Rameau and others (Tramo et al. 1992.2001.2008a; McKinney et al. 
2001); 
• Experiments on auditory perception by neurological patients that elucidated the functional role of the 
auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus) in spatial localization, speech recognition. and music recognition 
(Litovsky et al. 2002; Tramo et al. 2008c); 
• Experiments on the receptive field properties of macaque auditory cortex neurons via a novel alert 
preparation for microelectrode recordings that avoided the confounding effects of anesthesia and, 
consequently, uncovered a temporal response characteristics and spectrotemporal receptive field properties 
(Tramo 1998; Tramo et al. I999a,b); 
• Experiments on the neural coding of species-specific communication sounds in the primary auditory 
cortex of alert rhesus monkeys that revealed a candidate coding scheme based on the coarse temporal 
pattern of responses to different vocalization categories (Tramo 1998; Tramo et al. 1996. 1998); 
• Experiments on auditory acuity and experience-dependent plasticity in musicians and non-musicians 
that supports the claim that high perceptual acuity for music-related auditory functions is universal, and that 
the "use it or lose it" principle applies to the effects of music experience (formal and informal) on high 
acuity (Tramo et al. 2008d): 
• Experiments with premature infants supporting the claims that (a) music-related auditory functions are 
universal; and (b) controlled auditory stimulation with music ameliorates pain and stress caused by medical 
procedures (Tramo a al. 2006; Lense et al. 2008); 
• Development of novel MRI-based morphometric methods for flat-mapping and measuring the surface 
of human cerebral cortex; application of the methods revealed prenatal influences on the morphology of 
gyral-sulcal patterns in monozygotic twins and pathoanatomical correlates in patients with amusia, 
dyslexia, and schizophrenia (Tramo et al. 1990, 1995, 1998; Jouandet et al. 1989; Green a al. 1991, 1999; 
Loftus et al. 1995). 
Teaching contributions include: 
• Founding the Auditory• Neurobiology lecture course (Neurobiology 101) at Harvard College and 
Graduate School of Arts & Sciences (2007-current); 
• Founding the Music. Mind & Brain seminar course (Psychology 987b. then MBB 98) at Harvard 
College as a Faculty Fellow of the Harvard University Mind/Brain/Behavior Interfaculty Initiative; this is 
the longest running course in the history of the MBB Initiative (1995-current): 
• Sponsoring the Honors Theses and Research Awards of nine Harvard College students (1995-current); 
• Sponsoring Research Assistantships for over a dozen Harvard College, HMS, MIT. and outside students 
(1994-current); 
• Serving on thesis advisory and qualifying examination committees and sponsoring research and student 
laboratory rotations as a faculty member of the HST Speech & Hearing Bioscience & Techology Graduate 
Studies Program
