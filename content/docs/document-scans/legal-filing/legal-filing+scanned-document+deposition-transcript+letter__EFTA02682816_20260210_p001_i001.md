Dear Leslie, 
This is Kermit. It's been a pleasure to chat with you and I'm very happy to move forward 
with this conversation. 
As mentioned earlier I'm a lifetime student of evolutionary biology, wildlife conservation, 
and ethology. Natural history writing is my passion. I strive to make ecology and 
conservation accessible to segments within society that have little or no orientation to 
the sciences. The juncture where history, ecology and philosophy converge is often my 
canvas. The irreplaceable value of biodiversity within intact ecosystems is often lost on 
a large populace within our global community. The opportunity to articulate scientific 
information to diverse audiences presents many compelling challenges, some of which 
meld well with my particular skill set. 
In 2004 I began writing a feature length documentary entitled 'CHICKEN,' originally 
envisioned as a basic academic piece about the evolution and natural history of Gallus 
domesticus and its wild progenitors. I set it aside to focus on other writing and research 
only to rediscover it late last year. In re-tooling this project I've integrated a renewed 
focus on presenting a broad expanse of information obtainable to a wide audience. In 
short, CHICKEN becomes a surprisingly reachable treasure trove of inherited 
knowledge from our collective cultural antiquity. We look at the crucial role this bird 
played in Neolithic revolutions of specific cultures, exploring its significance in 
successful migrations and expansions of human civilization throughout the world. Our 
story chronicles the world's most important livestock species from sacred icon, to ritual 
symbol, to medicine, to food, immunology and more. Our historic relationship with the 
domestic fowl provides but one thread of a colorful, comprehensive and fully 
entertaining tapestry woven by our narrative. 
Because the chicken was domesticated by different cultures in different regions of Asia 
and Indonesia at different times in history and from different wild progenitors, 
unravelling the genetic code tied up in ancient feather art contributes one more thread 
in the anthro-biology of Polynesian history. In doing so we throw light on the rise and 
expansion of post-Neolithic civilization around the world. Utilizing molecular data from 
studies already being arranged, we will investigate the enigma of the blue egg laying, 
pre-Columbian chickens from Chile. Using tissue samples from ancient Polynesian 
artifacts adorned with rooster feathers, our nuclear and mtDNA data will provide 
evidence of the origins and migrations of early seafarers' ancestors and their possible 
route to the western coast of South America. 
Another thread celebrates the history of food and culinary expression from the origins 
of ancient India's chicken Vindaloo to the remarkable achievement of the Hebrew's egg-
ameliorated dough: the world's first baking renaissance. This ultimately resulted in the 
expansion of the Roman Empire, enabled by egg-enriched breads and pasta. India's 
Asil chicken is introduced as a major progenitor of meat breeds whilst Jerusalem's 
Lakenvelder as a primary founder of all egg production breeds. We celebrate the 
Chinese immigrant laborers' pivotal role building the American Railroad, reflecting on 
the significance of the chicken as the one portable livestock species sustaining them 
across the frontier. Generation after generation of Chinese labourers maintained a 
single lineage of Langshan chickens from Shanghai, the eggs of which ultimately 
culminate in a quintessentially American dish we know fondly as Egg Foo Yung.
