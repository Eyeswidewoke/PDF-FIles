the Pareto fallacy of corporate profitability, p211] contentedly telling their political 
interlocutors that corporate profitability makes all stakeholders better off. --3 So the agents 
of corporate social and political speech may believe they have conformed to the norm of 
public reason just as sincerely as do regular people. But they are no more successful at it. 
The incompatibility between the norm of public reason and the dynamics of corporate 
speech has two iniquitous effects. The first is that while corporations often succeed in 
achieving the policies they promote, such policies are not reliably in the public interest, but 
are instead reflective of corporate bias and motivation, which is shareholder primacy. The 
second consequence is that, for reasons Kahan makes clear, the public and policymakers 
are largely suspicious and resentful of corporate political speech. It may be that the 
"merely" sincere adherence to the norm of public reason by firms operating in the political 
realm is what helps give rise to the abiding skepticism and animosity that Americans have 
towards corporations. ^°4 The juxtaposition of professed objectivity or public spirit with the 
bias that we otherwise know they have is particularly galling. One survey from 2002 found 
that 70 percent of Americans "did not trust what . . . corporations told them and 60 percent 
called corporate wrongdoing 'a widespread problem."' m* 
The discourse norms that animate corporate speech inevitably clash with the norm of 
public reason, deepening our cynicism about the legitimacy of both corporations and 
government. Corporate political speech advances the firm's mission of corporate 
profitability, but it inhibits the mission of political speech in a free society. In particular, it 
precludes the full development of consumer, worker, and envi [` 212] ronmental protection

II. REFORMING CORPORATE LAW THROUGH PRESCRIPTIVE DISCOURSE 
NORMS 
I assert that the discourse norms attending corporations' relationships with their 
various stakeholders are themselves part of the default terms that comprise corporate 
law's enabling regime. The discourse norms provide rules of construction for the express 
speech (or silence) of the corporation to or about its stakeholders. Like corporate law itself, 
these norms are neither necessary nor inevitable-they are prescribed as part of a social 
construction project enabled by positive law. The default discourse norms that we find in 
corporate law get their justification from shareholder primacy theory, which I have argued 
is wanting. Corporate law might thus consider an alteration in the discourse norms that 
govern the firm's relationship with different stakeholders. 
A. The Utility of Multi-Fiduciary Discourse 
Progressive corporate law scholars have suggested that an alternative to shareholder 
primacy might be a corporate governance regime that requires directors to actively attend 
to the interests of multiple stakeholders at the level of firm governance. '6' In a multi-
stakeholder regime directors would be charged with attending to the interests of all of the 
firm's stakeholders with care and loyalty. Such a regime could be enforced the same way 
that fiduciary obligations are presently enforced by corporate law: by imposing discourse 
obligations on directors. Under a multi-stakeholder regime directors would be required to 
become informed about and discuss-in the honest, complete, good-faith fashion of
