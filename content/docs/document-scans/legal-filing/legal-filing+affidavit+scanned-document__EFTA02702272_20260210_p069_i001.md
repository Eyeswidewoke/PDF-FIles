If a withholding or deduction at source is required, we will, subject to certain limitations and exceptions 
described below, pay to the holders of the related preferred securities such additional amounts as may be 
necessary so that every Guarantee Payment pursuant to the preferred securities guarantee made to such holder, 
after such withholding or deduction, will not be less than the amount provided for in such preferred securities 
guarantee to be then due and payable. 
We will not be required to pay any additional amounts for or on account of: 
(I) any tax, fee, duty, assessment or governmental charge of whatever nature that would not have been 
imposed but for the fact that such holder (a) was a resident, domiciliary or national of, or engaged in 
business or maintained a permanent establishment or was physically present in, the relevant taxing 
jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or otherwise had some connection with the relevant taxing 
jurisdiction other than by reason of the mere ownership of preferred securities, or receipt of payment under 
such preferred securities guarantee, (b) presented such preferred security for payment in the relevant taxing 
jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof, unless such preferred security could not have been 
presented for payment elsewhere, or (c) presented such preferred security for payment more than 30 days 
after the date on which the payment in respect of such preferred security became due and payable or 
provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to such 
additional amounts if it had presented such preferred security for payment on any day within that 30-day 
period; 
(2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other 
governmental charge'. 
(3) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the 
failure by the holder or the beneficial owner of such preferred security to comply with any reasonable 
request by us or the trust addressed to the holder within 90 days of such request (a) to provide information 
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the holder or such beneficial owner or (b) to make any 
declaration or other similar claim or satisfy any information or reporting requirement, which is required or 
imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the relevant taxing jurisdiction or any 
political subdivision thereof as a precondition to exemption from all or pan of such tax, assessment or other 
governmental charge: or 
(4) any combination of items (I). (2) and (3) above. 
In addition, we will not pay any additional amounts with respect to the preferred securities guarantee to any 
holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such preferred security to the 
extent such payment would be required by the laws of the relevant taxing jurisdiction, or any political subdivision or 
relevant taxing authority thereof or therein, to be included in the income for tax purposes of a beneficiary or partner 
or senior with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have 
been entitled to such additional amounts had it been the holder of the preferred securities.
