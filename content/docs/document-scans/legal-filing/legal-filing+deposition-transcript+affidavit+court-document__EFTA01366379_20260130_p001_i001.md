cirewnstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers, directors and director nominees. 
These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of 
their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation 
against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our 
stockholders. Furthermore. a stockholder's investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of 
settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 
We believe that thr...e provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and 
retain talented and experienced officers and directors.
