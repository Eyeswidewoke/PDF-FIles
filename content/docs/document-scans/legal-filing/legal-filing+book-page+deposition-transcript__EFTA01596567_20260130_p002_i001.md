Payment information. Each billing cycle, you must pay at least the 
Minimum Payment Due shown on your monthly statement by its 
Payment Due Date. Both the Minimum Payment Due and Payment Due 
Date are noted on your statement. At any time you may pay more than 
the Minimum Payment Due up to the full amount you owe us, however 
you cannot 'pay ahead.' This means that if you pay more than the 
required Minimum Payment Due in any billing cycle or if you make more 
than one payment in a billing cycle, you will still need to pay the next 
month's required Minimum Payment Due by your next Payment Due 
Date. Remember to make all checks payable to UBS Card Services.

payment to us. Upon our receipt, your available credit may not
