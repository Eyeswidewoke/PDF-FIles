To be sure, the threat from Islamic extremism has not gone away. But the no=ion that the Islamists and their Sunni or 
Shiite arcs are poised to take o=er the Middle East and require some new grand interventionist strategy is =nother 
example of threat inflation. Osama bin Laden is dead. The Egyptian =uslim Brotherhood is a shadow of its former self. 
Hamas is contained in it= tiny Gaza enclave. Nasrallah and Hezbollah have been weakened by Assad's =ravails. And the 
prospect that a small al Qaeda offshoot is going to take =ver and govern large parts of Syria is fanciful at best. 
Indeed, the problem for many of the lands visited by the Arab Spring isn't =hat some new ayatollah or mullah is going to 
create a modern day Caliphate= but that there will continue be weak and ineffective governance in the re=ion, with 
those in charge incapable of coming up with truly national visio=s for their countries or leading in a way that addresses 
the basic politic=l and economic needs of their people. 
(2) Nobody wants America to play Mr. Fix-It. 
One thing is clear: We've likely seen the last of the big transformative-in=erventionist schemes to change the Middle 
East from the outside in the nam= of U.S. security, a freedom agenda, or anything else. I say this knowing =hat there's 
little historical memory here, that the military gives a willf=l president all kinds of options, and that the world is an 
unpredictable p=ace. But watching the public, congressional, and even expert reaction to t=e prospects of a limited U.S. 
strike against Syria, there's clearly zero s=pport for intervening militarily in somebody else's civil war. 
The alliance of the liberal interventionists and neocons who bemoan the Oba=a administration's lack of will, vision, and 
leadership and its abject spi=elessness in the face of 100,000 dead (a full half of whom are combatants =elonging to one 
side or the other) is simply no match for a frustrated pub=ic promised a reasonable return on two wars who instead got 
more than 6,00= American dead, thousands more with devastating wounds, trillions of dolla=s expended, a loss of 
American prestige and credibility, and outcomes more=about leaving than winning. 
To believe anyone in the United States is ready to invest additional resour=es in tilting at windmills in the Middle East is 
utterly fantastical. Who =an blame them? Last week in Libya, the one successful example of U.S. inte=vention in the 
Arab Spring, militias kidnapped the prime minister. Car bom=s kill scores weekly in Iraq. And, in Afghanistan, one can 
only despair ab=ut the gap between the price we have paid there and what we can expect in =erms of security and good 
governance in the years ahead. 
(3) An energy revolution is coming. 
Energy independence isn't around the corner. But there's a revolution brewi=g in North America that will over time 
reduce U.S. dependence on Arab oil.=U.S. oil production is increasing sharply for the first time in almost a q=arter 
century. And natural gas output is rising, too. Some people even pre=ict that, within a decade, America will become the 
world's largest produce= of oil and gas. Indeed, Saudi Arabia currently produces 10 million barrel= a day, while the 
United States churns out six million. If you add another=two million in natural gas liquids, you can -- without straining 
the bound= of credulity -- see the potential. According to Council on Foreign Relati=ns oil guru Michael Levi, even the 
cautious U.S. Energy Information Admini=tration predicts that, by 2020, U.S. production could get close to 10 mill=on 
barrels a day. 
The point is not that the United States is becoming the new Saudi 
Arabia<ht=p://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/10/16/the_end_of_opec_america_ener=y_oil>. As Levi points out, 
we're not in a position to manipulate and play=politics with our oil production to affect supply and price. But we are 
go=ng to become less reliant on Middle East energy. In 2011, we imported 45 p=rcent of our energy needs, down from 
60 percent six years earlier, and the=share of our imports from Western Hemisphere sources is increasing. Betwee= new 
oil in Brazil, oil sands production in Canada, and shale gas technolo=y at home, by 2020, we could cut our dependence 
on non-Western Hemisphere =il by half. Combine that with the rise in national oil production and grea=er focus on fuel 
efficiency and conservation, and the trend lines are at l=ast running in the right direction. 
As long as oil trades in a single market, we're still vulnerable to disrupt=ons, and the security of the Middle East's vast oil 
reserves will continue=to be a key U.S. interest. But our own independence and thus freedom of ac=ion as it relates to 
the Saudis and other Arab producers will only increas=. Given the fact that this month is the fortieth anniversary of the 
1973 o=l embargo, that's a good thing to contemplate. 
(4) Arab Allies are estranged. 
Part of the reason the United States is losing interest and influence in th= Middle East is that we're sort of running out of 
friends -- or, perhaps m=re to the point and to quote Franklin Delano Roosevelt's reported descript=on of a Nicaraguan 
president, our own SOBs. America is watching a region i= profound transformation. The old authoritarians with whom 
we fought (Sadd=m, Qaddafi, Assad the elder) and those on whom we relied (Yasser Arafat, H=sni Mubarak, Ben Ali, 
Abdullah Saleh) are all gone. It's true the kings re=ain. But the most important ones -- the Saudis -- have serious
