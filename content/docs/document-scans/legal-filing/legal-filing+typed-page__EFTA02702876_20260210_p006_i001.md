functional form r1 - 1 +ea +922. For exam*. we can have: (blue) policing Invades

3. Single mating 
For single mating. n= I. the invasion condition for a dominant 
police allele is

The stability condition for a dominant police allele is

Evolution of policing is highly sensitive to changes in colony effi-
ciency. For example, let us consider p, ,2 = 0.99 and pi = 1. This means 
that if half of all workers police then 99% of all males come from the 
queen. If all workers police then all males come from the queen. In this 
case, efficiency values such as r 1,2 = 1.001 and r, = 1.0031 lead to the 
evolution of policing. In principle, arbitrarily small increases in colony 
efficiency can lead to the evolution of policing for single mating. 
A plot of r, versus rif2 for singly mated queens (Fig. 6) illus-
trates the rich behavior highlighted in Fig. 5. Numerical simula-
tions of the evolutionary dynamics are shown in Fig. 7. 
Another intriguing feature is that increases in colony efficiency 
due to policing do not necessarily result in a higher frequency of 
police workers at equilibrium Fig. S illustrates this phenomenon. 
Four possibilities for the efficiency function r., are shown. Notice that 
the r2 curve which results in coexistence of police workers and non-
police workers (blue, top) is strictly greater than the r2 curve which 
results in all workers policing (green, second from top). How can 
increased efficiency due to policing possibly result in policing being 
less abundant at equilibrium? If a mutation for non-policing behavior 
is introduced into a resident policing population, then the evolu-
tionary success of the non-policing mutation depends on the success 
of Ao. 0 colonies relative to aa. 1. aa. 0. Aa. 1, and AA, 1 colonies. Au. 0 
colonies have an efficiency parameter r,,2. while the other four 
relevant colonies each have an efficiency parameter ri. Thus, if via is 
too large relative to r,, then the non-police allele can invade a resi-
dent policing population, and there is coexistence. 
Also notice that the r, curve which results in bistability of police 
workers and non-police workers (black, bottom) is strictly less than
