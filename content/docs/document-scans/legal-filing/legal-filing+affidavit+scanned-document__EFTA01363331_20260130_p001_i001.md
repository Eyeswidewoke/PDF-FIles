2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93633, * 
sanctions order. Additionally, the ineffectiveness of the Court's prior orders setting 
deadlines for North Shore to file its appellant's brief, as well as North Shore's failure to 
respond to Carroll's motions to dismiss gives the Court reason to doubt the effectiveness 
of such sanctions. 
North Shore has demonstrated little urgency in litigating its appeal. In addition to not filing 
a timely brief, it has elected not to file an opposition to Carroll's motions to dismiss. As 
such, the Court doubts the effectiveness of alternative sanctions. Cf. Richardson, 189 Fed. 
Appx. 93, at *98 (finding dismissal inappropriate where appellant requested two extensions 
and filed his brief prior to the District Court's order of dismissal). Based on North Shore's 
absence thus far it is not evident that alternative sanctions will prompt it to take action in 
prosecuting this appeal. [*16] Thus, the ineffectiveness of alternative sanctions weighs in 
favor of dismissal. 
6 Morn of North Shore's Appeal 
[HN11] The sixth Poulis factor considers the meritoriousness of the appellant's claim. 747 
F.2d at 868. "Ordinarily, '[a] claim, or defense, will be deemed meritorious when the 
allegations of the [motion], if established [], would support recovery by plaintiff or would 
constitute a complete defense." Buccolo, 308 Fed. Appx. 574, at n.1 (quoting Poulis, 747 
F.2d at 869-70). In this appeal, North Shore challenges the Bankruptcy Division's grant of 
summary judgment to Carroll in the amount of $115,140. North Shore also challenges the 
Bankruptcy Division's decision to deny its motion for reconsideration of the summary 
judgment. 
a. Unmet), Judgment 
[HN12] In reviewing a determination of a bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment, a 
reviewing court subjects the bankruptcy court's "legal determinations to plenary review, 
reviewing its factual findings for clear error, and considering its exercise of discretion for 
abuse thereof." In re Atamian, 300 Fed. Appx. 175, 176 (3d Cir. 2008)(citations omitted). 
A bankruptcy court may grant summary judgment if "the pleadings, the discovery and 
disclosure [*17] materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as 
to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." FED. R. 
Qv. P. 56(c) (hereafter referred to as "Rule 56(c)"); see also Hersh v. Allen Products Co., 
789 F.2d 230, 232 (3d Cir. 1986). 
[HN13] The movant has the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of 
material fact. Gans v. Mundy, 762 F.2d 338, 342 (3d Cir. 1985). Once the initial burden is 
met it shifts to the non-moving party to establish specific facts showing there is a genuine 
issue for trial. Id. The non-moving party "may not rest upon mere allegations, general 
denials, or ... vague statements ... ." Quiroga v. Hasbro, inc., 934 F.2d 497, 500 (3d Cir. 
1991). "[T]here is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the non-
moving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 
477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).

evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine
