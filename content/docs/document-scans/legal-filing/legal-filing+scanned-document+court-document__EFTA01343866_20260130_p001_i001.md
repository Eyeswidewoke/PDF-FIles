Americas Region Reputational Risk Committee Policy 
Deutsche Bank 
Presentations to the ARRC must be made by at least one person of Managing Director or Director level. 
The person making the presentation must: 
• 
clearly identify the issues; 
• 
set out what has been done, or is proposed to be done, to deal with the issues; and 
• 
carefully consider why DB should go ahead with the proposal in light of the issues posed. 
Primary drafting responsibility lies with the business line presenting the proposal, however, assistance 
may be sought from Legal and Compliance. A comprehensive proposal paper must be prepared and 
circulated within a reasonable time prior to the ARRC meeting through the Committee Secretary. There 
is no fixed format for a proposal paper, which should be tailored to the particular circumstances of the 
proposal, and should address the following issues, at a minimum: 
• 
A clear description of the proposal/transaction; 
• 
Explanation of what work has been done so far and a list of which infrastructure sign offs have 
been obtained (particularly Legal and Compliance); 
• 
Description of the diligence done on the counterparty or other relevant players; 
• 
Identification of the legal entities involved in the transaction or business; and 
• 
Identification of the reputational risk issues, analysis of such risks and details of the business 
line's view of how such risks can be mitigated or managed. 
The paper supporting the proposal should anticipate as much as possible the wide range of questions 
that a proposal of its nature might expect to attract at an ARRC meeting. 
For all CB&S proposals, a pre-clearance from Jeff Mayer, business head for CB&S, is required 
before the transaction is reviewed by the ARRC. 
For all LATAM proposals, a pre-clearance from Bernardo Parnes, the regional CEO of the Latin 
America region, is required. 
For all DBAG NY Branch proposals, a pre-clearance from Bill Woodley, the branch general 
manager, is required. 
For all Canada or Cayman proposals, a pre-clearance from Scott Lampard or Janet Hislop, the 
Chief Country Officers of Canada and Cayman respectively, is required. 
For all DBAG Cayman Islands Branch proposals, a pre-clearance from Carol Saracco, the branch 
general manager, is required. 
The presenter(s) of the proposal will be informed of the ARRC's decision after the meeting, by the 
Committee Secretary, the Chairman or by a nominated member. 
5.4 Quarterly Meetings 
Quarterly meetings will be held to review the regional reputational risk profile and direction; trends in 
reputational risk and any adjustments required to the regional reputational risk appetite. The agenda for 
the quarterly meetings will include: 
• 
Review of risk appetite; 
• 
Review of global and regional trends; 
• 
Update of regional reputational risk tolerances; 
• 
Update on the past quarter's reviewed transactions, including evidence of closure for conditions 
of approval; 
• 
Topical review of articles on competitors, industry trends; 
• 
Review of AWM reputational risk issues; and 
• 
Adjustment, if necessary, of regional reputational risk appetite.
