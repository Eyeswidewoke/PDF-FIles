General Events 
• Brookings: Can Trump bring manufacturing back to the US? — Thursday, July 10, 2025. Location: Online event, 
10:00 AM. President Donald Trump has promised to strengthen U.S. manufacturing and bring jobs back to 
America. To do this, he has imposed tariffs on a number of countries, reduced regulations, proposed tax 
cuts, and moved away from some energy efficiency standards. 
• Brookings: State of the  global economy: Navigating a new era of heightened uncertainty — Thursday, July 10, 
2025. Location: Online event, 10:30 AM. Just as the world began to show signs of recovery after a series of 
adverse shocks in the past few years, the global economy is once again contending with mounting economic 
and political headwinds. Rising trade tensions and heightened policy uncertainty are fueling economic 
instability. Rapidly escalating geopolitical conflicts, including the recent Iran-Israel war, threaten to further 
upend global economic prospects. 
• Carnegie: Geothermal Energy's Global Breakthrough — Thursday, July 10, 2025. Location: Online event, 12:00 
PM. Geothermal energy's moment is here. Once constrained by niche geologic resources, the ability to 
produce ubiquitous, clean power and heat from the earth's crust is now on the horizon. Thanks to drilling 
advancements from the American fracking revolution, the world's geothermal power potential has gone 
from an inconsequential fraction of demand to second only to solar power in renewable energy potential. 
• American Progress: Class of 2025 Forum: Student Perspectives on Public Education's Value and Impact —
Thursday, July 10, 2025. Location: Online event, 2:00 PM. Education reforms work best when youth take the 
lead. Join the Center for American Progress for an authentic conversation with a diverse group of students 
from the class of 2025 as they reflect on their educational journeys, how public schooling shaped their lives, 
and the opportunities we must seize to improve the future of education for the students who follow. Now is 
the moment to leverage youth experiences and voices in the development of policies, curricula, and school 
improvement efforts—and to do so as co-creators. 
• AEI: National Security vs. Economic Gain: A Debate on US-China Export Policy — Thursday, July 10, 2025. 
Location: Online event, 3:00 PM. Export controls, both American and Chinese, have come to rival tariffs in 
importance in the United States and China's bilateral relationship. They can also matter a great deal to US 
allies and friends, who wish to export products that rely on American technology to China. Restrictive export 
controls make it more difficult for China to re-create American technological gains, while permissive export 
controls allow more business for American and allied companies and could avoid China's own export 
controls. 
• Atlantic Council: President Umaro Sissoco Embalo on the future of US-Africa trade and security — Thursday, 
July 10, 2025. Location: Online event, 9:00 AM. On Thursday, July 10 at 9:00 a.m. ET, the Atlantic Council will 
host an #ACFrontPage conversation with President Umaro Sissoco Embalo of Guinea-Bissau. 
• Hudson Institute: President of Kosovo Dr. Vjosa Osmani Sadriu on Why US Leadership Matters in Europe —
Thursday, July 10, 2025. Location: Online event, 1:00 PM. The Republic of Kosovo has been a close ally of the 
United States since Washington formally recognized Kosovar independence on February 18, 2008.
