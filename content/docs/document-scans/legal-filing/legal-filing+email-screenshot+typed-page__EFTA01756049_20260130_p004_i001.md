compromise with our Palestinian neighbors," Mr. Netanyahu spent=the majority of his speech articulating a detailed 
warning about the dange=s posed by Iran's fundamentalist regime. Notwithstanding Ambassador Indy.'s wide policy 
mandate, it very likely does not extend to US policy on Iran. 
Syria—Understanda=le Reluctance but Troubling Missteps 
The Syria crisis—=dmittedly a dauntingly violent and complicated conflict where American int=rests are less than 
obvious to the public—has revealed the Administratio= to have a penchant for reacting to rather than shaping events. 
Much has been said about the sudden lurches in the Pr=sident's approach. He postured to use force and then paused, 
belatedly s=bmitting the issue for congressional authorization, only to pull back in t=e face of insufficient support. 
Secretary Kerry's=seemingly spontaneous response to a London press query about conditions un=er which the US might 
refrain from attacking Syria prompted a stunningly q=ick Russian initiative to negotiate the removal of Syria's chemical 
weapons, challenging Washington to take 'y=s' for an answer—which it did. While officials tout President Obama'= 
effective threat of force in compelling Syria to forfeit its chemical wea=ons, the UN Security Council resolution adopted 
with US support would require a second resolution before punitive action u=der Chapter VII is authorized—a precedent 
the George W. Bush administrat=on famously resisted on Iraq. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Secr=tary Kerry so 
readily welcomed Russia's offer of a negotiated dismantlement of Syria's chemical arsenal precisel= because of Mr. 
Obama's unreadiness to authorize military action.=/p> 
Even assuming that =he Syria chemical weapons disarmament process fully succeeds, major questi=ns remain. Yes, Mr. 
Obama will have recouped a measure of presidential cre=ibility by backing up his declared 'red line' on Syria's use of 
chemical weapons, albeit months after t=eir use had been confirmed by intelligence. But what of the President's =ther 
Syria 'marker —his August 18, 2011 declaration that "the time=has come for President Assad to step aside"? That 
declaration, although <http://thehill.com/blogs/global-aff=irs/middle-east-north-africa/328313-kerry-doubles-down-on-
demand-that-assa=-must-go> repeated <http://thehill.com/blogs/global-affairs/middle-east-n=rth-africa/3283B-kerry-
doubles-down-on-demand-that-assad-must-go> as recently as October 14 by Secretary Kerry, shows no sign of being 
pursued, much less fulfilled= notwithstanding administration pronouncements that the eleven-country "=eneva 
process" will effect a governmental transition in Damascus.=/p> 
The Atlantic Counci='s Fred Hof has posed a <http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/=logs/menasource/syria-getting-past-the-
chemicals> question <http://www.atlanticcouncilorg/blogs/menasource/syria=getting-past-the-chemicals> that many 
Syrians=are surely asking as well: has the US made Bashar al-Assad "an irreplaceable party to a long-term contract" to 
fu=fill its chemical weapons agreement? President Obama appears as indifferen= about whether his demand to rid Syria 
of its homicidal dictatorship will =ver be carried out as he is ardent about having his red line restored on chemical 
weapons. 
Having gained this =eprieve, President Assad can be forgiven for doubting that the threat of U= military force remains a 
realistic danger to his regime's survival, or =o his armed forces' freedom of action against the domestic opposition. It is 
Mr. Assad's good fortune that, wi=h the military strikes options pulled back from the brink, the Obama natio=al-security 
team left itself with no other levers of influence at hand to =ontain the spreading Syria crisis. 
When President Obam= initially solicited options to exert leverage on Syria in this crisis, hi= national-security staff 
turned straight to the Pentagon, which dutifully =enerated kinetic strike packages and target sets. Nowhere did that 
process <http://www.whitehou=e.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf> reflect the 
Administration's forward-looking doctrinal approa=h to international-security challenges 
<http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_vie=er/national_security_strategy.pdf> ying success to the 
integration of "all of the tools of American powe=" in a whole-of-government operation. The President also ignored the 
=ounsel of his top military advisor, General Martin Dempsey, who had public=y cautioned that in Syria "you need a 
strategy to tie military options with other instruments of power."
