Stig, our Danish Chief Engineer, has been working his mending magic on Te Manu since 2012. Growing up 
near the water, Stig began sailing at a very young age. After high school, he nurtured his love for the sea by 
joining a maritime program on an oil tanker. It was there that he discovered the intrigue of engineering and, 
for ten years, educated his way from cadet to engineer. After a time of working on various worldwide 
commercial oil tankers, Stig traded rough seas an pirate threats for a more comfortable lifestyle on yachts. 
When he's not fixing things, Stig enjoys exploring the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea. 
Willeen arrived at Te Manu after an eighteen hour flight from Mafikeng, South Africa, her hometown. Since 
then, she's had little time to catch up on sleep between work and enjoying the beauty of the Caribbean. 
Growing up in a farming community, Willeen is equipped with a strong sense of hard work, values, and 
resolve. Her desire to see the world led her to pursue a career in the yachting industry straight after 
graduating high school. Determined to hone her hospitality skills, Willeen seizes every moment, only pausing 
in the galley on occasion to concoct a South African specialty for the crew. 
Ian, Te Manu's energetic deckhand, joined the crew in 2012. Having grown up on a boat, Ian feels more at 
home on the water than any place else. Born in Fort Lauderdale to a Belgian father and Spanish mother, Ian 
was the perfect addition to St. Martin's culturally versatile society. He acquired his first job as a dock agent at 
Marina Fort Louis at age seventeen. It took him a mere two years to become dock master, a position he held 
for four years. Wanting a change of lifestyle that would keep him close to the sea, Ian joined the yachting 
industry. Ian is a skilful fisherman, diver, wake boarder, boater and photographer. 
Wieland is our German Bosun and safety representative. Though he was born in Swakopmund, Namibia, he 
grew up close to the sea in Hermanus, South Africa. With a yearning to travel, Wieland left his hometown at 
age twenty to spend a year in Australia. From there, he travelled to Corsica where he obtained his first 
yachting job. In the following four years he earned his Yacht Master's license and enough experience to 
captain a private twenty meter yacht. Presently, Wieland is loving the fast-paced charter life of Te Manu. In 
his free time, Wieland loves to skateboard, surf, and play beach ball. 
Howard, our second engineer, joined Te Manu in 2012. Born and raised in Hertfordshire, England, Howard 
began sailing the seas early in life. After finishing his first crossing from England to France on a thirty-five foot 
sail boat with his family at age nine, he went onto cruise the Mediterranean for three years. Yearning to 
explore his other interests, Howard obtained a degree in furniture design and, for ten years, pursued a career 
in the computer and media systems industry. He later returned to yachting and has been working in the 
industry for the past two years. If he's not on deck, Howard can be found documenting his travels with his 
GoPro camera. 
Neil, began his career as a chef over twenty years ago. He began his education at the Solihull College of Food 
in Birmingham, England. After completing his studies, Neil went on to work at an award-winning restaurant in 
his hometown. Working in a variety of different countries with various yachts, private residences and 
restaurants and running his own pub has provided Neil with valuable culinary experiences and tasty 
techniques. He is skilled in all styles of cooking, concentrated on fine dining. Outside of the galley, Neil enjoys 
relaxing with a round or two of golf.
