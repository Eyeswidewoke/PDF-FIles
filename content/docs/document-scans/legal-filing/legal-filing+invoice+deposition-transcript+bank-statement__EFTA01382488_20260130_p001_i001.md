Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Tahk of Contents 
SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
were subject to certain transfer restrictions and forfeiture prior to vesting. Deferred stock compensation, representing the fair value of the 
stock at the measurement date of the award, is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. The amortization of 
restricted stock resulted in compensation expense for continuing operations of $25.5 million in 2014, $15.8 million in 2013 and $13.1 
million in 2012. See Note V for additional information. 
Performance Share Awards In 2014, 2013 and 2012, Safeway granted performance share awards to certain executives. These 
performance share awards, covering a target of approximately 2.7 million shares, vested over three years. The 2014 performance share 
awards were subject to the achievement of specified levels of revenue growth and return on invested capital, as modified based on the 
Company's total stockholder return. The 2013 and 2012 performance share awards were subject to the achievement of earnings per 
share goals determined on a compound annual growth rate basis relative to the S&P 500. Safeway recorded expense of $3.5 million in 
2014 related to the 2014 awards. The Company recorded expense of $14.9 million in 2013 and $9.8 million in 2012 related to the 2013 
and 2012 awards based on the then expected achievement of the performance targets. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company 
determined that it no longer believed that achievement of the performance targets related to the 2013 and 2012 awards was probable. 
Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2014, the Company reversed $18.8 million of previously recorded expense on unvested 
performance shares. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, all of the performance shares vested upon closing of the Merger. However, in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Safeway did not consider the probability of the Merger occurring in recording 
stock-based compensation expense. 
On January 30, 2015, subsequent to the fiscal 2014 year end and in connection with the Merger, all outstanding stock option 
awards, performance shares, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards issued pursuant to various stockholder-approved plans 
and a stockholder-authorized employee stock purchase plan were automatically canceled in exchange for the right to receive certain 
cash consideration.
