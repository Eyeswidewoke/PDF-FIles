HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
subject to risks in addition to overall interest-rate movements and the issuers' ability to 
pay the debt in accordance with its terms. For example, were the Capital Strategy Fund 
to invest in syndicated debt such as loan participations, it would be subject to certain 
additional risks as a result of having no direct contractual relationship with the borrower 
of the underlying loan. In such circumstances, the Capital Strategy Fund generally 
depends on the lender to enforce its rights and obligations under the loan arrangements in 
the event of a default by the borrower on the underlying loan and will generally have no 
voting rights with respect to the issuer, as such rights are typically retained by the lender. 
Such investments are subject to the credit risk of the lender (as well as the borrower) 
since they will depend upon the lender forwarding payments of principal and interest 
received on the underlying loan. There can be no assurance that the lender will not 
default on its obligations under such arrangements, resulting in substantial losses to the 
Capital Structure Fund. 
Convertible Securities 
The Capital Structure Fund invests in convertible securities that it may acquire in the 
open market or directly from issuers, their affiliates and others. The value of a convertible 
security is a function of its "investment value" (determined by its yield in comparison 
with the yields of other securities of comparable maturity and quality that do not have a 
conversion privilege) and its "conversion value" (the security's worth, at market value, if 
converted into the underlying common stock). The investment value of a convertible 
security is influenced by changes in interest rates, with investment value declining as 
interest rates increase and increasing as interest rates decline. The credit standing of the 
issuer and other factors may also have an effect on the convertible security's investment 
value. The conversion value of a convertible security is determined by the market price 
of the underlying common stock. If the conversion value is low relative to the investment 
value, the price of the convertible security is governed principally by its investment 
value. To the extent the market price of the underlying common stock approaches or 
exceeds the conversion price, the price of the convertible security will be increasingly 
influenced by its conversion value. A convertible security generally will sell at a 
premium over its conversion value by the extent to which investors place value on the 
right to acquire the underlying common stock while holding a fixed-income security. 
Generally, the amount of the premium decreases as the convertible security approaches 
maturity. 
A contingent convertible security (known as "Co-Cos") is a hybrid security that is only 
convertible under certain conditions (for example, the right to convert can only be 
exercised if the price of the underlying stock is a certain percentage over the conversion 
price). A convertible security may be subject to redemption at the option of the issuer at 
a price established in the convertible security's governing instrument. If a convertible 
security held by the Capital Structure Fund is called for redemption, the Capital Structure 
Fund will be required to permit the issuer to redeem the security, convert it into the 
underlying common stock or sell it to a third party. Furthermore, an issuer could refuse 
to permit the Capital Structure Fund to convert the convertible security into the 
underlying common stock, despite its obligation to do so. Any of these actions could have 
an adverse effect on the Capital Structure Fund's ability to achieve its investment
