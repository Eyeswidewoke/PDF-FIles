[Asharq Al-Awsat] Are you in favor of sending it? 
[Quray] God willing, it will lead to a result. Our stance is known, and Net=nyahu's stance has become known. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] Netanyahu has said that he will reply with a letter. In y=ur opinion, will this lead to negotiations 
through letters? 
[Quray] I do not know how that will be. However, he answered in advance say=ng no to the return of the refugees, no to 
Jerusalem, and that the settlem=nt blocs will stay. Therefore, he has answered. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] Do you mean that the step is futile? 
[Quray] God willing, it will be useful. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] Do you have other options that could have been activated =ather than, for instance, the letter? 
[Quray] Of course we have options. We have a cause and we do not lack optio=s. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] What are the options that you consider that they have not=been used? 
[Quray] Popular resistance, for instance, is an important option. Consolida=ing the Palestinian presence, providing its 
requirements, and strengthenin= it, is also an important option. Also the option of a state for two peopl=s, a single 
democratic state is also an option. Our options exist as long as our national rights are not f=lfilled. 
[Asharq Al-AwsatJ You talk about the one-state solution; do you consider it=possible to apply? 
[Quray] This has been a Fatah project since 1967, a secular democratic stat= in which the Muslim, the Christian, and the 
Jew coexist. This originally =s a Fatah option, but it was amended in 1974 when it started to talk about=the 
establishment of a state on any part from which the occupation withdraws, and hence the National Counc=l adopted its 
resolution in 1988 to establish a Palestinian St ate. Later =n, the negotiations started on the basis of the National Council 
resolutio=. However, I say if this vision is not achieved, what can we do? We can activate our other options, includ=ng 
the one-state option. We - this generation - might not be able to fulfi= the aspirations of the people, but we should not 
squander them. The optio=s ought to remain open to the people. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] But these options have been proposed by the PA every now =nd then, which has made them lose 
their seriousness? 
[Quray] They should not be brandished for the sake of threatening; these ar= strategic options of a people and a cause. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] Do you agree with those who say that the two-state soluti=n is dead, and the option now is the one-
state solution? 
[Quray] No, I say that Israel is killing the two-state solution, and I look=up to the international community to tell Israel to 
stop, and also to say =hat the requirements of the two-state solution are the following. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] And then we start waiting again? 
[Quray] Our issue is not a picnic; it is an issue of a people, a homeland, =nd international and regional equations. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] Some people consider that there is the option of dissolvi=g the PA rather than all this? 
[Quray] No, this is as if we are in the middle of a race an then we shoot o=rselves in the foot. The PA is an achievement, 
and one of the signposts of=the Palestinian national struggle. It was not achieved free of charge; it =as achieved through 
long struggle and a great uprising. This is a temporary transitional authority for a tra=sitional stage during which the 
Palestinians hold the reins of their affai=s until the occupation ends. It is forbidden that a Palestinian should say=that he 
wants to dissolve the PA; this is despite the fact that Israel indeed has taken away much of the pow=rs of the PA when it 
returned to Ramallah and put Arafat under siege; neve=theless we ought to preserve the PA. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] There are those who call for thinking about the job of th= PA and its relationship with Israel, and 
redrafting all this? 
[Quray] I do not negotiate over the PA rather than negotiating over the per=anent solution. For instance, some people 
say that the economic agreement =s unfair; this is true, but I do not negotiate over the economic agreement= I do not 
want to improve the conditions of the transitional solution; this is not what we want. We want an agreeme=t over the 
permanent solution; this is what will give us complete sovereig=ty. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] The PA has tried to obtain sovereignty through going to t=e United Nations. In your opinion, was this 
step correct? 
[Quray] This is a correct, good, and required step. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] Does it contradict the negotiations? 
[Quray] No, no, this is our right. I am in favor of any step that brings us=closer to our right. 
(Asharq Al-Awsat] Are you also in favor of going back again to the United N=tions? 
[Quray] I believe that obtaining the status of non-member state is an impor=ant achievement. This will enable us to 
participate in many organizations =nd bodies along the way to the UN Security Council.
