1 did the =aul weiss bill get paid ??? =C2 2. Talk to me before signing anything today important 
1=m paid today to gratitude americawilll make last year complete. 20 million paid today ftc .=10 million july 15 5 
million sept 30. , 5 million jan=/span> 1 for all of 16 . tax savings paid at 37 percent . of net. savings. 50 million credit. 
net. =0 150 million free . 600 savings 225 million owed. - 50 credit, 175 owed.=C2 
600 million !I 
fyi two months late= we were dealing on a daily basis with Guzel issues and the transact=on was put on the back 
burner. 
Y=ur family office is what you are leaving to your children that will for th= first few years be their most important 
business asset . 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interferenc= , the level of his total and utter incompetence was 
brought clearly, =AO front and center. He may be a step up from Eileen, but, if he i= , then it is certainly not by much, 
A majorstupiditly whenever he gets a chance. The list of things that were done and not=20 done he refused to let be 
prepared as it will exemplify the outrageio=s lack of progress and prioirties 
=AO A critical example. - Though you and I hav= spent many many hours discussing the importance of attent=ve 
care and attention to details and mechanics. with regard Ph=idon I was not shown one single document, not o=e.!! 
Brad wanted to keep it private between he, and his so cal=ed " advisors " howeve= as he was out of the office during 
the most important transaction of the =ear, I did get to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your 
office is total=y ludicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Bra= last December - of things I thought were a 
priority to get done = still remains in the whole unresolved. Neither Alan nor Brad has reviewed t=e BRH agreemennt 
or the TRA , the two=largest financial assets of your portfolio, 
Alan as you estate attny should have sat you down , reivewed BRH in great detail=C2 , the Agreement amongst 
Principals ( death is a termination of the partner ) . the TRA ,and your will , etc. to my knowledge this =as not happened. 
The IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperate need of a=new system - reporting badly flawed , and both 
cumbersome and inacc=rate . all done by hand as one -off exercises , when either you or brad ask f=r it - airplane: re 
structure, (my only suggested priority in jun= ) is really ,no further ahead then it was then , consultants up the kazoo but 
nothing at all done.( the office was recently told by Brad=20 not to share the outside proposals with me - brad =as no 
idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in the office. . 
Eile=n was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is rampant a simple 
emblematic examp=e- 3 million in deductions I'm told were taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
the= cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes=20 they were deducted on the return they said 
that is the only real =AO question you were focused on ! " were they deducted or not=C2 - correct question would have 
been " is there a benefit " !! =C2 I asked for the balance sheet and/or P and L for Regan arts , the basic first step in 
order to check your financials.= "sorry we never got one?" though 9.8 million invested, no p=amp;l, nothing!, a 
construction project run amok , no budget, the coo =ired after only 3 months. , no clue . fyi</=pan> artspace financials
