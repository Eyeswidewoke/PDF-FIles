USE OF PROCEEDS 
We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock in this offering will be 
approximately $284.6 million, based on an assumed initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the 
estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts 
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares is 
exercised in full, we estimate that we will receive additional net proceeds of $46.0 million. We will not receive any proceeds from 
the sale of shares of Class A common stock by the selling stockholder. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public 
offering price would increase (decrease) the net proceeds from the offering by approximately $24.3 million, assuming the number of 
shares offered remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions. 
The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to create a public market for our Class A common 
stock, and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We plan to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-
grade, interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, or guaranteed 
obligations of the U.S. government. We currently intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering primarily for 
working capital and general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for acquisitions of 
complementary businesses, technologies, or other assets. We have not entered into any agreements or commitments with respect 
to any specific acquisitions and have no understandings or agreements with respect to any such acquisition or investment at this 
time. We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. Accordingly, our management
