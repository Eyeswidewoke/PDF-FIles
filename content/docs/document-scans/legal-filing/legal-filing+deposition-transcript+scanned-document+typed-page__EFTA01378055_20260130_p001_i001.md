stock, if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock in this offering). IAC is not subject to any contractual

Pre-offering relationship with IAC 
We have operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC since our incorporation. As a result, in the ordinary course of our business, IAC has provided us with 
various services. including accounting. treasury. legal, tax, risk management, corporate support and internal audit functions. Our combined statement of 
operations includes allocations of general and administrative costs. including stock-based compensation expense, related to these functions. For more 
information regarding these allocations, see Note 7 to our unaudited combined financial statements and Note 13 to our audited combined financial statements. 
In connection with the financing of certain acquisitions in 2011 and 2014, we borrowed money from (and issued related notes to) certain IAC subsidiaries, 
which borrowings are classified as long-term debt on the combined balance sheet in our audited combined financial statements. For more information 
regarding this long-term debt, see Note 7 to our unaudited combined financial statements and Note 13 to our audited combined financial statements. At the 
time of this offering, all long-term debt which we owe to IAC subsidiaries will be repaid. 
We recently acquired Plenty0fFish for $575 million. The purchase price was funded through a combination of $75.0 million of cash on hand and a 
$500.0 million cash contribution from MC. IAC will ultimately receive Match Group shares for the $500.0 million contribution. The number of shares that will be 
issued will be calculated using the initial public offering price in this offering. 
We and certain of our domestic subsidiaries currently unconditionally guarantee IAC's obligations under senior notes issued by IAC in 2012 and 2013. The 
indentures governing these notes contain restrictive covenants that limit the ability of IAC's subsidiaries to take certain actions generally and, in some cases, if 
IAC is not in compliance with the financial ratio set forth in the indentures. IAC's revolving credit facility is also currently unconditionally guaranteed by us and 
certain of our domestic subsidiaries and is also secured by our stock and the stock of certain of our domestic subsidiaries. Prior to the closing of this offering, 
we will no longer be a restricted subsidiary of IAC for purposes of its debt facilities, nor will we guarantee any debt of IAC nor will the stock of any of our 
subsidiaries be pledged to secure IAC's debt. For more information regarding these guarantees and pledges, see Note 7 to our unaudited combined financial 
statements and Note 13 to our audited combined financial statements. 
We have entered into certain arrangements with IAC in the ordinary course of business, specifically: (i) the leasing of office space for certain of our 
businesses at properties owned by IAC, for which we paid IAC approximately $1,000.000 in 2014, and (ii) the subleasing of space in a data center from an 
IAC subsidiary, for which we paid such IAC subsidiary approximately $1,100.000 in 2014.
