Long or short, Andreas Schmidt? 
The Global Head of Primary Private Equity discusses opportunities and risks in co-investments 
Do co-investors have to take a purely passive role? 
The purest form of co-investment is often seen as 
being practiced by institutional investors such as medium-
sized pension funds and insurance companies. These may 
have the institutional patience and implicit confidence in their 
counterparties to limit themselves to a purely passive role 
behind a lead investor. By contrast, many family offices take a 
more active approach while co-investing, for example including 
participation in corporate governance. This may not be a 
completely pure form of co-investment but this large and diverse 
constituency is important and should not be ignored. 
As co-investments are generally offered on a no-fee basis, can 
they exhibit adverse selection? 
ESSI One concern may be that lead investors will offer only 
the less attractive investment opportunities to prospective 
co-investors (so-called adverse selectioM. One way to mitigate 
this risk would be to co-invest through a private-equity platform 
that itself produces a significant flow of investment and 
demonstrably pursues a highly selective approach with due 
consideration of its own fiduciary responsibilities. 
Do mid-market funds also offer opportunities? 
Eal Mid-market funds may lack the manpower and skills of 
the mega funds. However they are probably most in need of 
co-investment and their often under-resourced investor-relations 
teams may therefore be very keen to maintain close relations 
with their most active limited partner-3. The large numbers of 
these funds, combined with their relative lack of resources and 
organization, have meant that they have proved a fertile hunting 
ground for the most sophisticated co
-investors. 
Must fundless sponsors always be ignored? 
Fundless sponson; intend to put little or no equity into 
the deal into which you are being asked to invest, instead taking 
a fee or other forms of compensation. Such deals are not for 
the faint-hearted, but with appropriately aligned interests there 
is in theory nothing to prevent a deal from a fundless sponsor 
outperforming one done with a brand-name fund. This may he a 
space to watch if investors become increasingly crowded out of 
more traditional co-investments. 
Can use of a co-investment fund make sense? 
En Ironically, when a private-equity platform sells a 
co-Investment fund, it is in fact selling you a blind-pool limited 
partnership (one without any visibility on ultimate investments) 
pretty much the exact opposite of a normal co-investment. 
But this can make sense for an investor. In addition to mitigation 
of adverse selection, with one commitment it may be possible 
to achieve a degree of diversification (in terms of geography, 
industry, manager, size, investment style and risk profile) that 
would be impossible to achieve with a commitment to a single 
manager.
