lending=— none of these developments were exactly secret. On the contrary= they were celebrated as vindications of 
the power and wisdom of markets.=Accordingly, Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courte=y of 
Lawrence H. Summers, George W. Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cabl= television ranters and squawkers. 
Even as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at lea=t a few investors, economists and 
government officials who warned that th= frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of these prophets 
wi=hout honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson's camera, less to glo=t than to present, once again, the analyses that 
were dismissed and ignor=d by their peers for so long. 
Dozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial=shots of New York, Iceland and other disaster areas —
are folded=into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an=opening song, "Big Time," by 
Peter Gabriel, and a score=by Alex Herres) and the clean wide-screen cinematography provide an aesth=tic polish that is 
welcome for its own sake and also important to the mov=e's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors 
convey=a sense of the rarefied, privileged worlds in which the Wall Street opera=ors and their political enablers 
flourished, and the elegance of the pres=ntation also subliminally bolsters the film's authority. This is=not a piece of 
ragged muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its out=age on reason, research and careful argument. 
The same was true of Mr. Ferguson's previous documentary, =9CNo End in Sight," which focused on catastrophic 
policies carrie= out in Iraq by President George W. Bush's administration just af=er the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. 
But whereas that film concentrated on=a narrow view of a complex subject — the conduct of the war rathe= than the at 
least equally controversial rationale for fighting it =94 "Inside Job" offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far=back as the 
Reagan administration and as far afield as Iceland in its ana=omy of the financial crisis. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be=interviewed. Mr. Summers appears only in 
news footage, and none of his pr=decessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not Robert E. Rub=n or Henry M. 
Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr.=Ferguson's questions. Nor do any of the top executives at 
Goldman=Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are, at least from=the perspective of the filmmaker, 
friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the=director's comprehensive critique of the way business has been do=e in the 
United States and the other advanced capitalist countries for th= past two decades. 
Both American political parties are indicted; "Inside Job"=is not simply another belated settling of accounts with Mr. 
Bush and his=advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government=oversight and the weakening of 
checks on speculative activity by banks be=an under Reagan and continued during the Clinton administration. And 
with=each administration the market in derivatives expanded, and alarms about=the dangers of this type of investment 
were ignored. Raghuram Rajan, chie= economist at the International Monetary Fund, presented a paper in 
2005=warning of a "catastrophic meltdown" and was mocked as a="Luddite" by Mr. Summers. 
Meanwhile, some investment bankers — at Goldman Sachs in particula= — were betting against the positions they were 
pushing on their=customers. An elaborate house of cards had been constructed in which bad=consumer loans were 
bundled into securities, which, were certified as sou=d by rating agencies paid by the banks and then insured via credit-
defaul= swaps. One risky bet was stacked on top of another, and in retrospect th= collapse of the whole edifice, along 
with the loss of jobs, homes, pensi=ns and political confidence, seems inevitable. 
How did this happen? Mr. Ferguson is no conspiracy theorist; nor is he inc=ined toward structural or systemic 
explanations. Markets are not like tec=onic plates, shifting on their own. Visible hands write laws and make dea=s, and 
in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems=to have driven very intelligent men (and they were 
mostly men) toward fol=y. In addition to business and government, Mr. Ferguson aims his critique=at academia, 
suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a=few prominent economists were corrupted by consulting 
fees, seats on boar=s of directors and membership in the masters of the universe club. 
When he challenges some of these professors, in particular those who held=positions of responsibility in the White 
House or in the Federal Reserve,=they are reduced to stammering obfuscation — Markets are complica=ed! Who could 
have predicted? I don't see any conflict of interes= — and occasionally provoked to testiness. Mr. Ferguson, for his=part, 
cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm. Occas=onally his voice pipes up from off camera, saying 
things like, "Y=u can't be serious!" 
But it is hard to imagine a movie more serious, and more urgent, than =80 Inside Job." There are a few avenues that 
might have been ex=lored more thoroughly, in particular the effects of the crisis on ordinar=, non-Wall-Street-connected 
workers and homeowners. The end of the film=raises a disturbing question, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand 
chan=es in the status quo so that the trends associated with unchecked specula=ion of the kind that caused the last 
crisis — rising inequality,=neglect of productive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust —=might be reversed.
