Table of Contrail 
Transaction and processing service fees revenue remained flat in 2013 compared to 2012 as increases in merchant related services 
revenue were offset by decreases in card services and check services revenue. Revenue increased due to volume growth of approximately $75 
million. Revenue increases were partially offset by negative pricing impact of approximately $25 million and negative foreign currency impact of 
approximately $20 million. Check services revenue declined $32 million as a result of lower overall check volumes and merchant attrition. Refer to 
"Segment Results" within this prospectus for additional information on our growth drivers. 
Product sales and other revenue increased during 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher equipment sales of $8 million, higher software

in the leasing business of $20 million, including interest income and fees on terminal leases, and the $12 million sale of a merchant portfolio in 
Poland in the fourth quarter of 2014. During 2014, we recognized $5 million for contract settlements and waivers. Foreign currency exchange rate 
movements negatively impacted the product sales and other growth rate for 2014 compared to 2013 by approximately 3 percentage points.

growth in professional services revenue of $12 million resulting from new projects. Foreign currency exchange rate movements negatively

Cost of services expense decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to our focus on operational and processing efficiencies including 
lower headcount and changes in compensation programs which resulted in $60 million in savings. a $10 million tax recovery in Australia. lower 
credit card authorization expenses of $19 million, and positive foreign currency impact. partially offset by product development initiatives of $26 
million and a $22 million reserve for uncollectible receivables in Latin America.

development costs.
