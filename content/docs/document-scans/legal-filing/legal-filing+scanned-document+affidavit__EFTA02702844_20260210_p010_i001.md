SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST) 
We have appointed HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., an affiliate of HSBC, as the agent for the sale of the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of a 
distribution agreement, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. will purchase the Notes from HSBC at the price to public less the underwriting 
discount set forth on the cover page of the pricing supplement to which this free writing prospectus relates, for distribution to other 
registered broker-dealers, or will offer the securities directly to investors. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. proposes to offer the Notes at the 
price to public set forth on the cover page of this free writing prospectus. HSBC USA Inc. or one of our affiliates may pay varying 
underwriting discounts of up to 0.60% per $1,000 Principal Amount in connection with the distribution of the Notes to other registered 
broker-dealers. 
In addition, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. or another of its affiliates or agents may use the pricing supplement to which this free writing 
prospectus relates in market-making transactions after the initial sale of the Notes, but is under no obligation to make a market in the 
Notes and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice. 
See "Supplemental Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)" on page S-59 in the prospectus supplement. 
U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
You should carefully consider the matters set forth in 'U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the accompanying prospectus 
supplement. We and each holder of Notes (in the absence of an administrative determination, judicial ruling or other authoritative 
guidance to the contrary) agree to treat the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as indebtedness issued by us that is subject to 
the special U.S. Treasury Regulations applicable to variable rate debt instruments. Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, in the opinion of 
Morrison & Foerster LLP, our special U.S. tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the Notes as variable rate debt instruments. Except to the 
extent of any original issue discount, interest paid on the Notes generally should be taxable to you as ordinary interest income at the 
time it accrues or is received in accordance with your regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, a 
U.S. holder (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) must include any original issue discount in income as ordinary 
interest as it accrues, possibly in advance of receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes may be issued with original issue 
discount. You should review the discussion set forth in 'U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations — Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders — U.S. 
Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Notes as Indebtedness for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes — Notes that are VRDIs' in the 
accompanying prospectus supplement. In general, gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Notes will be 
capital gain or loss. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the federal, state, local and other tax consequences to 
them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Notes.
