child sexual exploitation. The "reward" for spending days reviewing seized child 
pornography and other collateral evidence is to become the brunt of jokes about 
their sexual interests. 
This is a problem that supervisors as well as individual investigators must 
recognize and address. Investigators must be alert to the early warning signs of 
overexposure or stress. By using appropriate humor, limiting exposure, main-
taining good physical fitness, nurturing and seeking peer Support, and feelhig a 
sense of self-accomplishment, the investigator can turn a job perceived as "dirty" 
into a rewarding assignment. A more detailed discussion of this problem is con-
tained in a book chapter titled "The Maligned Investigator of Criminal Sexuality" 
(tanning & Hazelwood, 2001).

As previously discussed in the "Introduction," society has a particularly difficult 
time dealing with cooperating child victims and acquaintance child molesters. 
There are also several organizations in this country and around the world that 
openly voice a far different attitude about adult sex with children. The Rene Guyon 
Society North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), Pedophile 
Information Exchange (PIE), Child Sensuality Circle, the Pedo-Alert Network 
(PAN), and Lewis Carroll Collector's Guild are all examples of groups that at one 
time or another have openly advocated adult-child sex and changing the laws 
that make it a crime. These groups usually restrict their advocacy to "consenting" 
sexual activity with children and claim to be opposed to forced sex with children. 
Such groups move in and out of existence as active members come and go, but 
the attitudes persist. 
In spite of the attention that many of these organizations have received in the 
past, it is doubtful that they have had any significant impact on public opinion in 
general within the United States. Their greatest threat to society, other than the 
criminal acts of individual members, is as a source of support and validation for 
child molesters and pedophiles. These groups and the material they publish help 
child molesters justify their behavior. Many pedophiles are openly proud of their 
behavior. In her outstanding article, "The Indignant Page: Techniques of Neu-
tralization in the Publications of Pedophile Organizations," Dr. Mary De Young 
identifies the three neutralization techniques of such pedophiles as denial of 
injury (no harm done to child victim); denial of the victim (child deserved or 
. brought on the behavior); and appeal to higher loyalty (insistence that behavior 
serves the interests of a higher principle such as liberation of children or artistic 
freedom) (De Young, 1988). To some extent the Internet has made such groups 
obsolete. One no longer needs to join NAMBLA to get active validation for a sexual 
attraction to children. People can go on the Internet anytime of the day and fmd 
hundreds of others willing to actively validate their commonly held perverted 
interests. 
Interestingly a few academics, mental-health professionals, and sexologists 
express similar views. These so-called "experts" on human sexual behavior some-
times equate the existing laws that prohibit sex with children with laws that 
prohibit masturbation, fornication, and homosexuality. They advocate changing 
the laws so that children can choose their sexual partners freely, but under the 
guise of children's rights and freedom.
