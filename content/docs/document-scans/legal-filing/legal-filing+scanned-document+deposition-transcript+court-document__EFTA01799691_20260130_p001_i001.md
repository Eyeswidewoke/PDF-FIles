Re: 
I'm not ignoring you - but you probably also don't want to hear tha= you were in my junk folder : ) sorry. interesting 
information below o= 881- have to pull legislative history on initial enactment because still=no definition of obligation: 
Section 881(b) provides exemptions from, or reductions of, withho=ding tax and branch profits tax on certain U.S.-
source income received by =orporations organized in U.S. possessions. As one of the conditions for su=h treatment in 
certain cases, section 881(b)(1)(C) sets forth a "base-=rosion" test requiring that no substantial part of the possessions 
corpo=ation's income be used to satisfy obligations to "persons" who are n=t bona fide residents of such a possession or 
of the United States. Sectio= 937(a) provides in relevant part that for purposes of section 881(b), exc=pt as provided in 
regulations, a "person" is a bona fide resident if t=e person satisfies the requirements of section 937(a). For purposes of 
the=base-erosion test, §1.881-5T(f)(4)(i) defines a bona fide resident of a =ossession by reference to §1.937-1T, which 
provides that only a natural =erson, rather than a juridical person, may qualify as a bona fide resident=of a possession. 
Similarly, §1.881-5T(f)(4)(ii) defines bona fide reside=ts of the United States for purposes of the base-erosion test as 
including=only certain individuals who are citizens or residents of the United State=. 
Commentato=s observed that the interaction of these rules in the proposed and tempora=y regulations could result in 
disqualifying income from the withholding ta= exceptions in any situation where the possessions corporation makes 
payme=ts to satisfy obligations to persons other than individuals. These comment=tors further noted that many 
common business arrangements would run afoul =f the base-erosion test if corporations cannot constitute bona fide 
reside=ts. 
The IRS an= Treasury agree that such results would be undesirable and unintended. In =he context of section 881(b), the 
IRS and Treasury believe that the statut=ry terms persons and bona fide residents should not be interpreted as limi=ed 
to individuals. Accordingly, the final regulations additionally provide=that a corporation, or a business association that is 
treated as a corpo=ation for tax purposes, may qualify as a bona fide resident of a relevant =ossession or the United 
States for purposes of the base-erosion test if it=is created or organized in that jurisdiction. The final regulations reflec= 
that section 937(a) and the regulations under that section are intended t= apply only to individuals in determining 
whether a person is a bona fide =esident of a possession within the meaning of section 881(b)(1)(C). 
Note that =he IRS and Treasury believe that the words "direct or indirect" in sec=ion 881(b)(1)(C) (and §1.881-5(c)(3)) 
would authorize an anti-abuse rule=that prohibits payments to possessions corporations that are a part of bac=-to-back 
loan arrangements or other base erosion schemes. Accordingly, the=IRS and Treasury are strongly considering including 
such an anti-abuse rul= when finalizing the remaining proposed and temporary regulations under se=tion 881(b). It is 
expected that any such anti-abuse rule would be retroac=ive to January 31, 2006.
