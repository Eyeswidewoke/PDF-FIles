estate taxes." The Dechert report also stated that while the idea for the complex transaction did 
not originate with Epstein, Epstein "played an instrumental role in completing it."28
However, responses you provided to the Committee minimized Epstein's involvement in 
the transaction, stating that "the idea was in the public domain and originated with Black's other 
legal advisors. Nevertheless, Epstein tried to take credit for the idea and secure compensation."29
Your attorneys further added that the dispute over compensation for the step-up-basis transaction 
contributed to your decision to terminate your professional relationship with Mr. Epstein." The 
Committee is concerned that these responses are at odds with the Dechert report's claim that 
Epstein's role in the transaction was "significant" or "instrumental." In fact, your responses did 
not provide any information clarifying how Epstein contributed any value to the transaction 
outside of that provided by other legal advisors. 
The responses you provided the Committee did not substantiate Epstein's services related 
to the step-up-basis transaction and cast further doubt on whether his efforts merited the payment

between you and Epstein that Epstein would be compensated for some portion of the value 
conferred from any idea that "originated" from Epstein." However, your responses made clear 
that the idea for the step-up-basis transaction did not originate with Epstein, but instead 
originated with other legal advisors. 
Despite Epstein's limited and heavily disputed role in the step-up-basis transaction, 
Epstein demanded payment of $60 million.92 The Committee still does not know how or why you 
settled on a payment of $20 million instead of the $60 million Epstein demanded for the
