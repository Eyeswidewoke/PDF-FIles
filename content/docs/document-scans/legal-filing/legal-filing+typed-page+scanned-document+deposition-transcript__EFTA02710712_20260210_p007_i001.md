Crumbl=ng infrastructure endangers the physical and economic well-being of all Americans. In 2007 the I.35W 
Mississippi River Bridge in Minneapolis, which had been categorized as structurally deficient, collapsed, resulting in the 
death of 13 people and =45 injured. Two years earlier, New Orleans' levees failed to hold back the flood waters of 
Hurricane Katrina, claiming =he lives of more than 1,800 people, and causing at least $125 billion in econo=ic damage. 
Both disasters illustrate the cost of neglecting the country's infrastructure. 
Moreover, infrastructure inv=stment holds the promise of accelerating the sluggish economic recovery. Infrastructure 
spending pumps money into local economies by creating work for private-sector companies an= good-paying 
construction jobs. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, found in 2011 that new=federal spending for 
infrastructure improvements to highways and public schools wou=d generate $1.44 of economic activity for each $1 
spent. Richard Trumka= president of the AFL-CIO, estimates that every billion dollars spent on transportation 
infrastructure=creates 35,000 well-paying jobs. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office found that infrastructure 
investments had one o= the strongest economic[GB1] impacts of all the policies included in the American Reinvestment 
and Recov=ry Act. 
=span style="font-size:12ptline-height:107%;font-family:Georgia,serif">R=building our crumbling infrastructure is a 
daunting, but achievable, goal. The nation needs an additional $129.2 billion per year investment to meet the current 
backlog o= infrastructure repairs and improvements, according to a report by American Progress's Donna Cooper, 
"Meeting the Infrastructure =mperative: An Affordable Plan to Put Americans Back to Work Rebuilding Our

Rebuild the Middle Class This will requ=re states to raise and spend much more on infrastructure. And although f=nding 
is scarce due to the Great Recession and the slow economic recovery, states are using new and creative methods to fund 
infrastructure projects. 
Except that some states lag beh=nd. On average the federal government provides 20 percent of surface-transportation 
funding to state projects while state and local s=ending accounts for 50 percent and 30 percent, respectively. But in 17 
state=, federal funds were the primary source of transportation dollars, as of 2006. Even with a hea=y reliance of 
federal dollars in some states and cities, a significant amount of federal money is going unused. Cooper's analysis for 
American Progress shows that based on the loan-matching requirements established by Congress,=at least $20 billion in 
private, state, local, or public authority capital cou=d be drawn into U.S. infrastructure projects if the federal loan and 
loan-gua=antee programs were fully tapped. As such this is an opportune time for state governments to catch up on our 
long backlog =f infrastructure priorities. Interest rates available to states are historically low and policymakers who act 
now=to finance their infrastructure can lock in inexpensive financing for many yea=s into the future. 
According to Bloomberg News, most states—regardless =f which political persuasion dominates them — are issuing less 
of the debt =hat ordinarily pays for roads, bridges, and airports. Municipal bond issu=nce was down 12 percent in 2013. 
More than half of the debt raised went toward renewing funding for existing obligations rather than financing new 
projects. Overall spending on infrastructure fell. Former Reagan economic advisor, Larry Summers argues tha= today's 
low interest-rate environment makes this an ideal time to invest in infrastructure. A j=st-released report from Standard
