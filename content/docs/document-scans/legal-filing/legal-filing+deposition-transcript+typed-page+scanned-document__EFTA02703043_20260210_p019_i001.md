retirement savings, compared to $19,000 for the ave=age African-American family and $12,000 for the average Hispanic 
family. =n some ways, this understates the retirement crisis for everyone—African-American and Hispanic families, as 
well=as whites. The Urban Institute also looked at liquid retirement savings for the median family, not the average. 
That's i=portant because a few very rich people at the top of the income distribution can distort the statistics: Say 20 
people are in a bar, each of whom make $50,0=0 a year. Then Bill Gates walks into the bar. Suddenly, the average 
income of e=ch person in the bar skyrockets. But that's just a result of Gates's exorbitant income, not everyone in the 
bar=getting richer. Using the median overcomes this problem. 
And that's where the =iquid retirement savings data is most alarming. The median white family has just $5,000 in liquid 
retirement savings, up from $1,500 in 1998. For=African-American and Hispanic families, the median is zero. Minority 
families have trouble saving for retirement for two other reasons outlined in the Ur=an Institute study. First, they have 
lower homeownership rates, which, while not a liquid savings vehicle, is one of t=e most common ways that Americans 
save. More than 20 percent of Americans over the age of 60 have savings in real estate=or land. But the 
homeownership rate for whites is more than 50 percent larger =han the rate for African-American and Hispanic families 
— and the gap h=s stayed constant for the past 30 years. 
=/P> 
Second, African-Americans families have more =tudent debt than whites. In 2013, 42 percent of African-American 
families had student debt, compared to just 28 percent of whites and 16 percent of Hispanics. And, as the Urban 
Institute authors note, African-Americans have lower graduatio= rates than whites and "people of color 
disproportionately attend for-profit schools, which have low graduation rat=s." That means that African-Americans 
aren't just taking on more in debt. They also aren't always getting a degree for that de=t. 
The gap in retirement savin=s can't only be blamed on access to, or participation in, retirement savings vehicles. "In 
2013, 47 percent of whites participated in employer retirement plans,•=9D McKernan said, "and 40 percent of blacks 
and 28 percent of Hispanics (didj.•=A0 Part of those difference in participation rates is access. But what surprised us is 
that while only 28 percent of Hispanics are participating in a plan, the=r average liquid retirement savings weren't as 
different as African-A=ericans as we thought they'd be. "It suggested to us that employers offering a retirement account 
isn't necessarily g=ing to fix it," she added. "There needs to be ways to mak= those savings automatic." 
McKernan and her co-authors recommend six=ways to increase retirement savings for African-Americans and Hispanics. 
They propose automa=ic IRA plans so that employers who don't offer pensions automatically =educt a portion of their 
employee's paycheck and deposit it in an IRA.4k=A0 The Obama administration has already approached such a proposal. 
A year ago, the president announced the c=eation of myRA accounts that would allow employers to offer retirement 
accounts to their workers (but not auto-enrol= them in them). The program is just getting underway, but could provide 
an important way to get all Americans t= save more.
