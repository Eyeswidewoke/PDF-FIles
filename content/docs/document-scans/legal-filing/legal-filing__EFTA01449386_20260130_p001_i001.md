3 reasons not to fear a 3%+ 10yr yield 
1600 should be good support even if 10yr treasury yields go a little over 3% 
As discussed last week, we are increasingly tolerant of higher treasury yields 
given the coincident climb in the euro and oil prices. Treasury yield 
normalization poses little threat to S&P EPS provided euro and oil prices prove 
resilient. Our view that the chief risk to EPS from higher yields is via FX and 
commodity prices is sometimes challenged by investors who see other threats 
to EPS from higher interest rates, such as interest expense, or threats to the 
S&P's valuation. This note gives a few reasons to discount these concerns. 
Interest expense is relatively small and likely overpoweied by pension swings 
Net interest expense at S&P 500 non-financials is likely under S150bn in 2013, 
which after-tax is roughly $10 of EPS. Essentially all of the $2trn in net debt at 
non-financials is now long-term debt because cash is more than double short-
term debt and companies have been using more long-term debt in their debt 
mix. Usually 10-15% of long-term debt rolls over each year and much of it is 
still rolling to lower rates. But, if we assume that 15% of long-term debt rolls to 
a rate 100bp higher the hit to 2014 S&P EPS would be -$0.25. If we assume 
that the effective interest rate rises 200bp on all non-financial net debt the hit 
to S&P EPS is about $3, but if this occurs it would play out over several years. 
Pension expense at S&P non-financials is likely to fall more than an increase in 
borrowing costs as long-term yields rise, particularly through 2015. The 
improved pension funding we expect at 2013 end should provide a -$2 benefit 
to S&P EPS in 2014. If yields rise another 100bp at 2014 end it would eliminate 
deficits and provide another -$2 S&P EPS boost in 2015 (not in our estimates). 
Pension expense declines would likely stop at this point even if yields climbed 
higher because of likely shifts in pension asset allocations. This would cause 
some pension drag from lower ROA assumptions, but all considered lower 
pension expense should offset higher long-term borrowing rates. 
Financial earnings will likely benefit from higher treasury yields and eventually 
higher short-term interest rates. Thus, we see little threat to overall S&P EPS. 
A IS foiwaid PC wouldn't be threatened until 10yr yields were well over 4% 
Assuming a fair S&P 500 equity risk premium of 4% (historically 3-4%), it 
would likely require a 10yr treasury yield of -5% or a 10yr TIPS yield over 2% 
to threaten the fairness of a -'15 forward PE on normalized S&P EPS. However, 
such an increase in long-term interest rates would significantly amplify US 
fiscal risk. Thus, it is important that any such climb in yields be slow and over 
multiple years, while the deficit is further tamed and housing strengthened. 
Treasury yields x:  cooeed the dividend yield, but won't grovy like dividends 
Dividend yields like earnings yields represent real yields. Expected inflation 
must be added to these observed yields in order to compare them to nominal 
interest rates. The 10yr TIPS yield provides a comparable real interest rate, 
which at 0.75% suggests that EPS and DPS yields remain very attractive. The 
S&P's indicated dividend yield is 2.1% and we expect DPS growth to be -15% 
next year and at least 6% thereafter. This suggests an offered long-term 
nominal return on S&P ownership over 8% with the ability of that offered 
nominal return to adjust for inflation variations over the long term.
