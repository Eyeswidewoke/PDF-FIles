night before the Capitol riot and described them as "viable and potentially deadly." Kelly disputed that assessment, 
saying, "That also was a lie because they were not viable in any way, shape or form," and argued that "it's 
imperative that this FBI gets the job done that the old FBI refused to do." The article noted that Kelly believes 
current Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino are committed to identifying and prosecuting those responsible 
after what she called the Biden Justice Department's decision to "basically shut down" the case in 2021. 
Continued Reporting: Video Shows What Happened After Wounded U-Haul Driver Left Bay Area Coast 
Guard Base 
San Francisco Chronicle (10/27, Cassidy) reported that newly obtained surveillance video captured what occurred 
after a U-Haul truck backed toward Coast Guard personnel at the entrance of Coast Guard Base Alameda, 
prompting them to open fire during a night of protests against planned immigration raids. According to the article, 
the FBI said it took one of the individuals into custody and confirmed that its evidence response team, crisis 
management team, and special agent bomb technicians were assisting in the investigation, though the agency has 
not identified the person or released further details. The article noted that the video showed a car arriving minutes 
after the shooting, with someone helping the wounded U-Haul driver into the vehicle before driving away, and that 
the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office have both declined to comment as the investigation continues. 
Continued Reporting: Idaho Teen Pleads Guilty to Planning Attack in Support of ISIS 
Idaho State Journal (10/27, White) reported that a Coeur d'Alene teen, Alexander Scott Mercurio, pleaded guilty to 
attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State after FBI agents uncovered online posts and plotted 
attacks on multiple churches and other violent acts. The FBI investigation — which used an informant to meet with 
Mercurio after agents learned of his online allegiance — prompted his April 2024 arrest; former FBI Director 
Christopher Wray called Mercurio's plot "truly horrific." According to the article, prosecutors say Mercurio swore an 
oath of loyalty to ISIS, planned a suicide mission using knives, guns and fire, discussed stealing his father's guns, 
and intended to send his money to the group after the attack. The article noted that Mercurio, who was 18 at 
arrest and graduated from Coeur d'Alene Public Schools in 2023, faces up to 20 years in federal prison and is 
scheduled to be sentenced on January 27 next year. The article added that Mercurio told reporters he self-
radicalized while studying online, expressed praise for extremist figures, and was apprehended before carrying out 
any of the violent plans. 
Jake Tapper Says New Book on Extremist Brought to Justice Shows Risk of Trump 'Devaluing' Experts 
The Philly Voice (10/27, Tanenbaum) reported that CNN anchor Jake Tapper discussed his new book, Race Against 
Terror, which recounts how the FBI was alerted by Italian authorities in 2011 after al-Qaeda operative Spin Ghul 
arrived on a refugee ship from Libya and confessed to killing U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. According to the article, 
Ghul's unprecedented U.S. trial required extensive coordination between the FBI, international partners, and 
federal prosecutors to collect battlefield evidence and testimonies proving his involvement in a 2003 ambush near 
Pakistan that killed two American service members; he was convicted of terrorism offenses in 2017 and sentenced 
to life in prison. The article noted that Tapper warned of the dangers of political interference in national security, 
citing that "the devaluing of expertise and the placing of politics above all else carries enormous risks," and 
emphasized that building terrorism cases "takes a huge effort and a lot of experts who know what they're doing."

Former Politico Reporter Under Investigation for Allegedly Spying for China 
The Post Millennial (10/27, Wakerell-Cruz) reported that European intelligence services are investigating a former 
Politico reporter accused of spying for the Chinese government and using their position to collect information from 
officials in Brussels. According to the article, intelligence sources told Euractiv that the reporter allegedly cultivated 
contacts at international organizations and even made sexual advances toward certain officials as part of efforts to 
obtain sensitive information. The article also cited related espionage cases, including the conviction of Jian Guo, a 
former aide to a member of the European Parliament in Germany, who was sentenced to nearly five years in prison 
for passing information to Beijing, and the U.S. prosecution of linchao Wei, a Navy sailor convicted of selling 
classified military data to a Chinese intelligence officer for $12,000. Politico said European authorities had not 
contacted the company and declined to comment on the reporter's departure, describing it as a "confidential
