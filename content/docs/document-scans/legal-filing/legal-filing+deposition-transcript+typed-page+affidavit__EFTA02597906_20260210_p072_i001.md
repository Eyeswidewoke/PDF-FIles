Under separate cover, you have been sent materials (the "Tender Offer Documents") being sent to all stockholders of 
The Limited, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with its recently announced offer to pur=hase up to 15,000,000 
outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, $.50 par v=lue per share (such shares, together with all other 
outstanding shares of comma= stock of the Company, are herein referred to as the "Shares"), at=a price specified by 
such stockholders not greater than $55.00 nor less than $50.00 per Share, upon the terms and subject to the conditions 
set forth in the Of=er to Purchase dated May 4, 1999 and in the related Letter of Transmittal, whi=h together constitute 
the "Offer". 
The Company will determine a single per Share price (not greater than $55.0= nor less than $50.00 per Share) that it will 
pay for the Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn (the "Purchase Price&=uot;), after taking 
into account the number of Shares so tendered and the prices specifi=d by tendering stockholders. The Company will 
select the lowest Purchase Pric= that will allow it to purchase 15,000,000 Shares (or such lesser number as =re validly 
tendered and not withdrawn at prices not greater than $55.00 nor lers than $50.00 per Share) pursuant to the Offer. All 
stockholders whose Shares are purchased by the Company will receive the Purchase Price for each Share purchased in 
the Offer. 
As a holder of vested stock options, you may wish to exercise any or all of your vested options, and then tender the 
Shares so acquired to the Company pursuant to the terms of the Offer. To assist you, attached is a summary of your 
stock option grants, including the grant date, exercise price, and the number of options from each grant that are 
currently available for you to exercise. 
You will need to evaluate the Tender Offer Documents to determine if participation would be advantageous to you, 
based on your stock option exercise prices, the date of your stock option grants and the years left ye= to exercise your 
options, the range of tender prices, and the provisions fo= pro rata purchases by the Company outlined in the Offer. 
We strongly encourage you to discuss the Offer with your tax advisor or broker. Merrill Lynch is also available to assist in 
answering any question= you may have. They can be reached at (614) 225.3194, if calling from Columb=s, Ohio, or (800) 
637-3766 (toll-free), if calling from outside Columbus, Ohio= 
If you decide to exercise any of your stock options, attached is a Form B-- Notice of Exercise for you to use. The Offer 
expires on Tuesday, June 1, 19=9, unless extended by the Company. If you do intend to exercise stock options =n order 
to tender Shares in the Offer, you will need to exercise your options=by Monday, May 24, 1999, in order to obtain 
Shares to tender by June 1, 1999. 
As described in the Offer to Purchase, if fewer than all Shares validly tendered at or below the Purchase Price prior to 
the expiration of the Offe= are to be purchased by the Company, the Company will purchase Shares in the following 
order of priority: (a) all "odd lot" Shares tendered at=or below the Purchase Price prior to the expiration of the Offer by 
any stockholder who owned beneficially as of the close of business on May 3, 1999, an aggregate=of fewer than 100 
Shares, and who validly tenders all of such Shares (partial tenders will not qualify for this preference); and (b) then, after 
purchase=of all of the foregoing Shares, all other Shares validly tendered at or below =he Purchase Price and not 
withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer, on a pro rata basis, if necessary (with appropriate adjustments to avoid 
purchas=s of fractional Shares). 
The Offer is not being made to, nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of, holders of Shares in any jurisdiction in 
which the making of the Offer or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of suc= jurisdiction. In 
those jurisdictions the laws of which require that the Off=r be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer shall be 
deemed to be mad= on behalf of the Company by Lazard Freres & Co. Ilc and J.P. Morgan Sec=rities Inc. or one or more 
registered brokers or dealers licensed under the laws o= such jurisdiction.
