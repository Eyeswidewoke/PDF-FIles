MiFID II increases regulation of trading platforms and firms providing investment services 
in the European Union. Among its many market infrastructure reforms, MiFID II has brought in: 
(i) significant changes to pre- and post-trade transparency obligations applicable to financial 
instruments admitted to trading on EU trading venues (including a new transparency regime for 
non-equity financial instruments); (ii) an obligation to execute transactions in shares and 
derivatives on an EU regulated trading venue; and (iii) a new focus on regulation of algorithmic 
and high frequency trading. These reforms may lead to a reduction in liquidity in certain financial 
instruments, as some of the sources of liquidity exit European markets, and may result in 
significant increases in transaction costs. 
Other regulatory changes, such as an increase in the scope of commodities and commodity 
derivatives regulation, including position limits and position management powers could similarly 
lead to liquidity reduction and/or an increase in costs and spreads in the European commodities 
markets. 
Although the full impact of these reforms is difficult to assess at present, it is possible that 
the resulting changes in the available trading liquidity options and increases in transactional costs 
may have an adverse effect on the ability of the Management Company to execute the investment 
program. 
New rules requiring unbundling the costs of research and other services from dealing 
commission and further restrictions on the Management Company's ability to receive certain types 
of goods and services from brokers may also result in an increase in the investment-related 
expenditure of an Underlying Fund. 
Inflation and Deflation 
The enormous amounts of financial assistance which the governments and central banks 
have made available in an effort to resolve the prevailing economic difficulties could eventually 
lead to material levels of inflation or the prevailing slow economic activity could lead to deflation. 
Inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had, and may continue to have, negative 
effects on the economics and Securities markets of numerous economies. Any subsequent 
unexpected deflation could also have an adverse impact on an Underlying Fund's strategies and 
investments. There can be no assurance that inflation or deflation will not become a serious 
problem in the future and have an adverse impact on the Partnership's returns. 
Market Disruptions 
An Underlying Fund may incur major losses in the event of disrupted markets, and other 
extraordinary events may not be consistent with historical pricing relationships (on which the 
Management Company bases a number of its trading positions). The risk of loss from a disconnect 
from historical prices is compounded by the fact that in disrupted markets many positions become 
illiquid, making it difficult or impossible to close out positions against which the markets are 
moving. 
The financing available to an Underlying Fund from its banks, dealers and other 
counterparties is typically reduced in disrupted markets. Such a reduction may result in substantial 
losses to the Partnership. In the 1994, 1998, 2007, 2008 and 2009 market environments, a sudden
