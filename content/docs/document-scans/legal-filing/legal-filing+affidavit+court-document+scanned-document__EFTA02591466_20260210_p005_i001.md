the willingness of a community to =ccept the money as a payment for goods and services, rather than =hrough 
state/central bank authorisation.[1] <x-msg://5/#_ftnl> The bank regulates the =mount of WIR francs in circulation -
WIR francs accounted for 0.2 % of =HF M1 in 2009[2] <x-msg://5/#_ftn2> ; it also defines the rules =f participation and 
the usage of WIR credits - e.g. WIR credit cannot =e redeemed for Swiss francs; and sanctions members for illegal 
=ehaviour through exclusion - e.g. such as discounted market trading of =IR francs for Swiss francs.[3] <x-
msg://5/#_ftn3> [4] <x-msg://5/#_ftn4> 
Second, it acts as a "commercial bank" and as such =as been subject to relevant banking regulations in 
Switzerland since =936 when it was first given the status of a bank. In this =apacity, WIR bank provides a range of 
banking products (including =usiness loans and mortgages) to its clients in Swiss francs, WIR =redits or a combination of 
both. WIR francs are used by =articipants to exchange goods and services within the WIR =xchange. Since every WIR 
credit is matched by an equal and =pposite debit, the system as a whole must net to zero.[5] 
Third, WIR bank acts as a "trade facilitator" by =roviding the WIR platform or system through which WIR 
members can =xchange goods and services with each other using the WIR franc as a =artial or full means of payment. In 
this context, WIR bank also =rovides a range of marketing and communication services (e.g. web =istings, WIR fairs) and 
advisory services (e.g. workshop, advice on the =et-up of a WIR budget) to members to enable them to trade within the 
=ystem. The WIR system is also supported by independent local =embers' groups (e.g. Groupement WIR Suisse 
Romande) that act as local =etworking and discussion forums throughout =witzerland. 
Today, circa one in five SMEs in =witzerland is a WIR member[6] <x-msg://5/tutn6> , =esulting in over 60,000 
SMEs trading with each other within the WIR =ystem, of which one third are from the construction industry. The =alue 
of WIR franc-based transactions amounted to CHW 1.627 billion[7] in 2010, representing circa =.3% of Swiss GDP for the 
same year[8] <x-msg://5/#_ftn8> . Prices =re denominated in Swiss francs and can be paid using WIR credits, Swiss 
=rancs or a combination of both. While some participants accept =IR francs as 100% of the payment for their goods and 
services, the =inimum rate of WIR francs for every transaction is 30% up to a value of =,000 CHF; and subject to 
agreement between the parties beyond that =hreshold. The average rate of acceptance is usually between 30% =nd 
40% of the total amount.[9] <x-msg://5/#_ftn9> Through partial acceptance, =articipants meet costs and liabilities that 
cannot be met through WIR =redits such as salaries, tax and social contributions. As a =esult, trading within the WIR 
system results not only in an increase in =urnover in WIR credits but also in Swiss francs. [10] <x-msg://5/#_ftn10> [11] 
<x-msg://5/#_ftn11> 
The WIR multilateral exchange is underpinned by a strong =eeling of community and trust. An obvious 
advantage lies in the =utual benefits arising from trading with someone that is part of the =ystem rather than an 
outsider. Moreover, given its history, it is =ften seen as a trading mechanism sustaining local economic development 
=nd SME growth, especially as SMEs account for 98% of all companies in =witzerland.[12] <x-msg://5/#_ftn12> 
Researchers have analysed the counter-cyclical nature of the =HW. Using 56 years of WIR data on participants, 
CHW in =irculation, turnover and credit, Stodder (2009) =emonstrates the counter-cyclical nature of WIR credit, 
showing =hat WIR credits are most likely to be accepted when ordinary money is =n short supply and suggesting that the 
purchasing power created through =IR could become an instrument of effective macroeconomic =tabilisation.113] <x-
msg://5/#_ftnB> Recent media pieces(141 have explored the relevance =f WIR exchange in the recent crisis and 
highlighted how participants' =urnover in CHW in a variety of sectors has remained stable or increased =elative to their 
turnover in CHF (which decreased as a result of the =inancial crisis).
