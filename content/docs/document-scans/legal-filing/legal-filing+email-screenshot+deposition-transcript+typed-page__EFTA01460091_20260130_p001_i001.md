This document contains -forward-looking statements-- that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected 
future business and financial performance, and often contain words such as 'expect—anticipate; intend.'splan," "believe," "seek," or *will.' Forward-looking statements by their 
nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Particular uncertainties that could adversely or positively affect future results include: the behavior of financial 
markets, including fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets; continued volatility and further deterioration of the 
capital markets; the commercial and consumer credit environment: the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal actions; strategic actions, including acquisitions 
and dispositions; future integration of acquired businesses: future financial performance of major industries; and numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, 
including those of a political, economic, business and competitive nature. These uncertainties may cause actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in 
our forward-looking statements. 
Although this document has been carefully prepared and is based on information from sources believed to be reliable, no representation is made that it is accurate and complete. 
We have no obligation to update or amend the information provided herein, and information is subject to change without notice. 
Investments in Foreign Countries - Such investments may be in countries that prove to be politically or economically unstable. Furthermore, in the case of investments in foreign 
securities or other assets, any fluctuations in currency exchange rates will affect the value of the investments and any restrictions imposed to prevent capital flight may make it 
difficult or impossible to exchange or repatriate foreign currency. 
Such markets may be in transitional or formative stages and thus may be significantly less stable than developed markets. Changes in emerging markets 
government structures or other political instability may result in nationalization, expropriation, ad hoc regulation, or foreign investment restrictions. Emerging market investments 
are at risk for currency devaluation, as well as convertibility, liquidity and transparency constraints. The high volatility and speculative nature of emerging market investments may 
result in both significant losses or profits. 
Such transactions involve multiple risks, including currency risk and settlement risk. Economic or financial instability, lack of timely or reliable 
financial information or unfavorable political or legal developments may substantially and permanently after the conditions, terms, marketability or price of a foreign currency. 
Profits and losses in transactions in foreign exchange will also be affected by fluctuations in currency where there is a need to convert the products denomination(s) to another 
currency. Time zone differences may cause several hours to elapse between a payment being made in one currency and an offsetting payment in another currency. Relevant 
movements in currencies during the settlement period may seriously erode potential profits or significantly increase any losses. 
- Investing in high yield bonds, which tend to be more volatile than investment grade fixed income securities, is speculative. These bonds are 
affected by interest rate changes and the creditworthiness of the issuers, and investing in high yield bonds poses additional credit risk, as well as greater risk of default. 
The risk of loss in trading commodities can be substantial. The price of commodities (e.g., raw industrial materials such as gold, copper and aluminum) may be 
subject to substantial fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. Additionally, valuations of 
commodities may be susceptible to such adverse global economic, political or regulatory developments. Prospective investors must independently assess the appropriateness of 
an investment in commodities in light of their own financial condition and objectives. Not all affiliates or subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Group offer commodities or commodities-
related products and services.

or predict its future performance. Availability of alternative investments is subject to regulatory requirements. 
„ -An investment in hedge funds is speculative and involves a high degree of risk No assurance can be given that a hedge fund's investment objectives will be 
achieved, or that investors will receive a return of all or part of their investment. Investments in hedge funds are suitable only for persons who can afford to lose their entire 
investments. Before investing, prospective investors should carefully consider these risks and others, such as lack of transparency, higher fees, illiquidity, and lack of registration.
