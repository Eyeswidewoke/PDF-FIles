(2) default by the property trustee in the payment of any distribution when it becomes due and payable, 
and continuation of such default for a period of 30 days; 
(3) default by the property trustee in the payment of any redemption price of any trust security when it 
becomes due and payable; 
(4) default in the performance, or breach, in any material respect, of any covenant or warranty of the 
trustees in such restated trust agreement, other than a covenant or warranty a default in the performance of 
which or the breach of which is dealt with in clause (2) or (3) above, and continuation of such default or 
breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the defaulting 
trustee or trustees by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding 
preferred securities of the trust, a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be 
remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" under such restated trust agreement; or 
(5) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the property trustee and 
the failure by the holder of the common securities of the trust to appoint a successor property trustee within 
60 days thereof. (Section 1.1) 
Within five Business Days after the occurrence of any Event of Default actually known to the property trustee, 
the property trustee shall transmit notice of such Event of Default to the holders of the trust's preferred securities, 
the administrative trustees and to us, as Depositor, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived. 
We, as Depositor, and the administrative trustees are required to file annually with the property trustee a certificate 
as to whether or not we and the administrative trustees are in compliance with all the conditions and covenants 
applicable to us and the administrative trustees under the restated trust agreement. (Sections 8.15 and 8.16) 
If an event of default under the corresponding subordinated debt securities has occurred and is continuing, 
the preferred securities shall have a preference over the common securities upon dissolution of the trust as 
described above. See "— Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution of the Trust." The existence of an Event of 
Default under the restated trust agreement does not entitle the holders of preferred securities to accelerate the 
maturity thereof. 
Removal of Trustees 
Unless an event of default under the corresponding subordinated debt securities shall have occurred and be 
continuing, any trustee may be removed at any time by the holder of the common securities. If an event of default 
under the corresponding subordinated debt securities has occurred and is continuing, the property trustee and the 
Delaware trustee may be removed at such time by the holders of a majority in liquidation amount of the 
outstanding preferred securities. In no event will the holders of the preferred securities have the right to vote to 
appoint, remove or replace the administrative trustees, which voting rights are vested exclusively in the holder of 
the common securities. No resignation or removal of a trustee and no appointment of a successor trustee shall be 
effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee in accordance with the provisions of the 
restated trust agreement. (Section 8.10) 
Co-Trustees and Separate Property Trustee 
Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time or times, for the purpose of 
meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part of the property 
of the trust may at the time be located, the holder of the common securities and the administrative trustees shall 
have power to appoint one or more persons either to act as a co-trustee, jointly with the property trustee, of all or 
any pan of the property of the trust, or to act as separate trustee of any such property. in either case with such 
powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such person or persons in such 
capacity any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the provisions of the 
applicable restated trust agreement. In case an event of default under the corresponding subordinated debt 
securities has occurred and is continuing, the property trustee alone shall have power to make such appointment.
