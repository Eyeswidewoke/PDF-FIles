FINANCIAL CRIME & CORPORATE SCANDALS 
FBI Raids Legislative Office Of Former Ohio House Speaker. 
The Dayton (OH) Daily News (7/31, Bischoff, 121K) reports, "Federal agents executed a search 
warrant on the Ohio House on Friday to seize items from state Rep. Larry Householder's office." 
The Dayton Daily News "obtained a copy of the search warrant and seizure inventory through a 
public records request. The House GOP caucus issued the following statement: 'The Ohio House 
of Representatives today received and fully cooperated with a federal search warrant for 
personal items at the Riffe Center belonging to Larry Householder. The House will continue 
cooperating with federal investigators as part of our effort to restore integrity and trust to the 
House." 
The Cleveland Plain Dealer (7/31, Pelzer, 895K) reports from Columbus, Ohio, "FBI agents 
raided ex-House Speaker Larry Householder's legislative office on Friday, seizing a number of 
personal items, according to a House Republican spokeswoman." The Plain Dealer adds, "The 
move comes a day after a federal grand jury indicted the Perry County Republican and four 
allies on racketeering conspiracy charges for allegedly running a $60 million bribery scheme 
using FirstEnergy money to pass a $1.3 billion bailout of two nuclear power plants. Lawmakers 
also removed Householder as speaker on Thursday. The search warrant, approved Thursday 
evening, sought six boxes and four envelopes containing computers, storage devices, records, 
calendars, call lists, photographs, as well as evidence of who used the computers and how." 
The Cincinnati Enquirer (7/31, Balmert, 223K) reports, "The FBI was searching for records 
or information related to allegations that Householder and four others participated in a nearly 
$61 million scheme to help Householder win control of the House, pass a $1.3 billion bailout for 
two nuclear plants in northern Ohio and upend an effort to block the law on the ballot. 
Householder and his alleged co-conspirators were indicted on racketeering charges Thursday." 
FBI Visits Office Of Kentucky Official Who Gave Wife Bonuses. 
The Lexington (KY) Herald-Leader (7/31, Estep, 257K) reports, "It appears the FBI is following 
up after the state auditor's office found that a Kentucky county attorney gave his wife bonuses 
totaling $126,500 in two years." According to the Herald-Leader, "The audit found that 
Lawrence County Attorney Mike Hogan gave a total of $134,500 in bonuses to staff members 
between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2019 from delinquent tax fees, but that nearly all the 
money went to Hogan's wife, a legal secretary in his office." The Herald-Leader adds, "The 
office referred the findings to the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, Attorney General Daniel 
Cameron, the state Revenue Department and the county ethics board. On Thursday, Katie 
Anderson, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Kentucky, confirmed agents were 'conducting judicially 
authorized activity' at the Lawrence County child support office." 
FBI Searches Offices Of Philadelphia Firm In Fraud Probe. 
The Inquirer (PA) (7/31, Distefano, Roebuck, Arvedlund, 347K) reports, "FBI agents have 
raided the Old City offices of Par Funding, the firm at the core of an alleged $500 million 
investment scheme and the subject of a wide-ranging U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission complaint." The Inquirer adds, "The agents executed search warrants on Tuesday 
morning at locations that included a Par Funding office at 141 N. Second St., according to law-
enforcement sources familiar with the matter who were not authorized to publicly discuss it. In 
its recent sweeping complaint against Par and others alleging financial fraud, the SEC relied on 
at least one recording in which an 'FBI confidential source' spoke with one of the pitchmen who 
raised money from investors in the scheme."
