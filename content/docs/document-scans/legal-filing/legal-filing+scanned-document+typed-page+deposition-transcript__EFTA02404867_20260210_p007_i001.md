fas=ion. The pivot point came during a lengthy, televised speech delivered on =arch 15 by the party's longstanding 
secretary-general, Sayyid Hassan Nasra=lah. Speaking to hundreds of students mainly on the subject of illiteracy and the 
dire need for greater access t= education in the Arab world, Nasrallah eventually turned to the anti-gove=nment 
protests in Syria that began in March 2011. 
Almost from the outset, he was especially fran= in equating the opposition and the Assad regime, urging -- even 
pleading =or -- a negotiated political solution where both sides first "simultaneously" lay down their weapons (a 
call=subsequently made by the U.N. Security Council). "These matters canno= be dealt with by fighting, confrontations, 
wars, or by inviting foreign m=litary intervention," Nasrallah stressed, an intimation that, while some in the opposition 
should be blamed for calling for extern.' intervention, the regime also bore at least some responsibility, since i=s actions 
had (quite obtusely) moved the possibility of intervention to th= forefront of the international discourse. But he had 
more specific demands of the regime, too. 
"All forms of massacres and the targeting=of civilians and innocent people are to be condemned," he said. "=Now the 
opposition is accusing the regime and the regime is accusing the opposition. One of the regime's responsibilities today is 
=o present the facts to the people. Those who have the facts should present=them. Leveling accusations left and right is 
an easy thing to do but the m=in thing is that the massacres deserve to be condemned...All forms of killing must stop 
(emphasis added].=quot; 
What explains his heightened sense of urgency =n these matters -- ever a function of the many constituencies that he 
must=constantly juggle? Nasrallah argued that a great unravelling in the Middle East accompanied by extreme violence 
is =ast coming into focus."We are apprehensive," he said, "that=Syria, and hence the region, might be divided. We are 
afraid of a civil wa=, anarchy, and the weakening of Syria and its position as a pan-Arab force in the Arab-Israeli struggle 
and a genuine ba=ker for the resistance movements in the region [emphasis added]." Of =ourse, Nasrallah has long 
acknowledged these concerns, and said, during hi= speech, that he was merely reiterating this specific point of concern. 
What was different, however, was that alongsid= an unmistakable sense of alarm was an acknowledgement that, after 
months =f predicting the regime would get the upper hand, the situation has instead stalled just at the edge of chaos. 
The cri=ical question that now follows is how will Hezbollah approach a further de=erioration in Syria -- a still likely 
outcome -- in the coming phase? 
Unfortunately for proponents of militarizing t=e situation, and also those hopeful of violently "declawing" Hez=ollah, 
Nasrallah's new rhetoric does not aid the oft-repeated assertion that, in the event of a bloody Syrian regime collap=e, 
Hezbollah would just absorb the major strategic and ideological blow wi=h a minimal (or symbolic) response. (The 
corollary myth, it should be poin=ed out, has been that Iran would similarly limit its response in a militarized event and 
that Assad diehard=, for their part, would also not want or be able to do much harm in their =aning moments). 
Indeed, he suggested that Hezbollah, together =ith "the part of the Syrian people" who steadfastly reject what =he party 
believes is essentially a pro-Zionist push for supremacy over the Levant, will necessarily be forced to use counterfo=ce at 
some point -- the logic of resistance -- to defend mutual interests =o clearly threatened by a direct attack on the regime. 
"We tell our S=rian bothers," Nasrallah clarified, "people, regime, state, army, parties, and political forces -- your b=ood 
is our blood, your future is our future, your life is our life, and ou= security and fate are one." 
Ironically then, Nasrallah actually ends up wh=re so many regime opponents who believe in a direct confrontation are 
now:=in the absence of a viable political track, the only way to stave off total chaos, massive violence, and a collapse 
of=one's vital interests will be to introduce decisive counter-violence to th= picture. 
What is perhaps new here -- and more frighteni=g -- is that Nasrallah now also seems publicly concerned that the Assad 
re=ime, and not just the opposition and its external allies, are pushing everyone along a path to war, including 
Hezbo=lah. The brutal truth then for Nasrallah is that after having so tightly w=d his party to Assad, Hezbollah's own 
agency in these vital matters -- exi=tential matters as he repeatedly declares -- has been severely undercut. This means 
that even if Hezbollah =ould prefer to keep relatively quiet in the event of a violent regime coll=pse, Nasrallah feels he
