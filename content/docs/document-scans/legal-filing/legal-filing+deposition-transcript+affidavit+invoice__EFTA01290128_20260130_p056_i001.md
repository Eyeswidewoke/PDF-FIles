Pershing's Impartial Lottery Process: Partial Calls 
When a security is subject to a partial redemption, pursuant to New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Rule 402.30, which has been incorporated into the FINRA Consolidated Rulebook, Pershing must have 
procedures in place that are designed to treat clients fairly in accordance with an impartial lottery prOceSS.When an issuer initiates a partial call of securities, the depository holding such securities (typically, the 
Depository Trust Clearing and Corporation, or DTCC) conducts an impartial, computerized lottery using an incremental random number technique to determine the allocation of called securities to participants for 
which it holds securities on deposit (including Pershing). Because DTCC's lottery is random and impartial, participants may or may not receive an allocation of securities selected for redemption. 
When Pershing is notified that it received an allocation of cared securities, Pershing conducts a similar, coniputer-generated random lottery. The lottery detenrines the accounts that will be selected and the 
number of securities in the account that will be redeemed. Allocations are based on the number of trading units held in the account. The probability of any trading unit held by an account being selected as called 
in a partial call is proportional to the total number of trading units held through Pershing. 
Once the lottery is complete, Pershing notifies introducing broker-dealers whose introduced accounts have received an alocation. Securities registered in the client's name, either in transit or held in custody, are 
excluded from the Pershing lottery process. 
Pershing initiates the lottery process by identifying the accounts holding the called security, the total par value of the called securities held, and the trading unit of the security.
