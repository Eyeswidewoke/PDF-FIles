with any information reasonably requested by the Limited Partner in order to withhold 
tax or to file tax returns and reports or to furnish tax information to any of its partners,

ARTICLE IX 
INDEMNIFICATION 
9.1 
Indemnification of Covered Persons. 
(a) 
General. The Fund shall and hereby does, to the fullest extent permitted 
by applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person from and against 
any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, losses, suits, 
proceedings and actions, whether judicial, administrative, investigative or otherwise, of 
whatever nature, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated ("Claims") that may 
accrue to, or be incurred by, any Covered Person, or in which any Covered Person may 
become involved, as a party or otherwise, or with which any Covered Person may be 
threatened, relating to or arising out of the investment or other activities of the Fund, 
activities undertaken in good faith in connection with the Fund, or otherwise relating to 
or arising out of this Agreement, including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in 
compromise or as fines or penalties, and counsel fees and expenses incurred in 
connection with the preparation for or defence or disposition of any investigation, action, 
suit, arbitration or other proceeding (a "Proceeding") whether civil or criminal (all of 
such Claims, amounts and expenses referred to in this Section 9.1 are referred to 
collectively as "Damages"), except to the extent that it shall have been determined in a 
decision based on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Damages 
arose primarily from Disabling Conduct of such Covered Person, provided that, to the 
extent that such court determines that such Damages did not arise primarily from the 
Disabling Conduct of such Covered Person but arose partially from the Disabling 
Conduct of such Covered Person, such Covered Person's right to indemnification 
hereunder shall be reduced proportionately to reflect the relative liability of such Covered 
Person for such Damages. The General Partner or the Manager shall notify the Advisory 
Committee as to the nature of any Proceedings prior to paying any amounts in connection 
with a Proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Covered Person will only be 
eligible for indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.1 for Claims relating to or arising 
out of transactions that took place during the time such Covered Person was a 
shareholder, officer, director, employee, partner, member, agent or manager of any of the 
General Partner, the Manager or any of their respective Affiliates or during the time such 
Covered Person was a member of the Advisory Committee. The termination of any
