II. TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT APPLY TO CLIENT'S ACCOUNT(S) 
The following terms and conditions govern Client's Account(s): 
1. Rights of DBSI. All rights granted to DBSI under this Account Agreement are granted with the understanding that it shall be 
within the sole discretion of DBSI whether, and in what manner, to exercise such rights. The failure of DBSI to exercise any 
right granted under this Account Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or any other right granted hereunder. 
DBSI retains the right to delegate to its agent, including its clearing agent, Pershing LLC ("Pershing"), one or more of DBSI's 
rights or obligations under this Agreement without notice to Client. 
2. Cash Account. DBSI will classify each Account as a cash brokerage account. DBSI must separately approve the opening of a

each security purchased. DBSI retains the right to cancel or liquidate any order accepted and/or executed without prior notice to 
Client, if DBSI does not receive payment by settlement date. Alternatively, upon Client's failure to pay for purchased and settled 
securities, DBSI has the right to sell Securities and Other Property held in any of Client's Account(s), and charge to Client any
