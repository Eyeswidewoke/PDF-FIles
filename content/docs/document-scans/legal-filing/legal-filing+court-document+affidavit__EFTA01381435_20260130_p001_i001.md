up to the date on which the compensation event is determined in accordance with section 10 (1). 
(3) The coverage level under section (8) refers to the depositor's aggregate claim against the CRR 
credit institution in accordance with subsection (2) above, irrespective of the number of accounts, the 
currency and the location at which the accounts are maintained. 
(4) In the case of an account opened in the name of two or more persons or over which two or 
more persons have rights that are exercised by means of the signature of one or more of those persons 
(joint account), the share attributable to the individual account holder shall apply to the coverage level in 
accordance with section 8. In the absence of more specific provisions, the deposit shall be attributed to 
the account holders in equal parts. 
(5) Subsection (4) shall apply mutatis mutandis to accounts that are maintained in the name of a 
condominium owners' association, provided that the members of the condominium owners' association 
are regarded as account holders. 
(6) Subsection (4) shall apply mutatis mutandis if several persons are absolutely entitled to an 
eligible deposit. 
(7) The compensation shall be paid in euro. If accounts are maintained in a currency other than the 
euro, the exchange rate to be applied shall be the European Central Bank's reference rate on the date on 
which BaFin determined the compensation event in accordance with section 10 (1). If no European 
Central Bank reference rate is available, the middle rate of the identifiable buying and selling rates on the 
reference date shall be used to calculate the exchange rate. 
(8) CRR credit institutions shall provide the deposit guarantee scheme at any time on request with 
all information that it needs to prepare compensation payments, including information about the 
aggregated amount of eligible deposits of every depositor. For this purpose, the eligible deposits shall be 
marked in such a way that they can be determined immediately for every depositor. The CRR credit 
institution shall provide the deposit guarantee scheme with the data needed to make compensation 
payments to creditors in a computerised format that complies with the requirements of the deposit 
guarantee scheme.
