Curriculum Vitae 
Mark Judc Tramo. April 2009 
emotion caused by stroke, neurodegenerative disease, head trauma, systemic diseases, and developmental 
diseases. 
2. Patient Load and Complexity 
I see up to eight patients every other week in the MGH Cognitive Neurology Outpatient Unit. I typically serve 
as the Attending on one of the Neurology Inpatient Services one month per year, with 10 days per month of 
Emergency Room coverage during that month.
