human right violations of foreign labor in the UAE, and the lack of free elections in the 
UAE, etc. What do you think of these allegations? What do you think is the reason behind 
spreading such malicious reports? 
They may write whatever they like, and play the tunes that please them. We are not annoyed by criticism, nor do 
we fear campaigns. They have their models, experience, values, standards, their cultural and intellectual frames 
of references. We have our models, values, standards and frames of references. We are open to the entire human 
experience in every field. We learn from them, but we will never import ready-made models. We do not accept 
that, and our society does not accept this. As for the allegations about foreign labor, it is an old theme, repeated 
every now and then. Yes, certain sectors of foreign labor are not in the state we like or hope. But we are steadily 
improving that state, and we are making progress every year. For years, the talk about foreign labor has not 
ceased. Such talk is open to all and to the countries that provide such labor. Despite that, millions are trying to 
come to work in our country. So, why do those foreign countries don't stop their citizens from coming to work in 
the UAE if the work situation is such as these nasty reports claim? 
By Al Emarat Al Youm 
The UAE is facing a regional and global media campaign that questions its ability to 
overcome the global financial crisis. How does Your Highness evaluate such campaigns? 
What are the tools and the initiatives with which to respond, including the development of 
local media? 
Action is louder than words. Our achievements and hard work would be the response to these campaigns. The 
UAE is immune to such campaigns, and questioning of its ability to continue developing a strong federation is not 
going to yield anything. When we established the UAE federation, we faced analysis and speculation campaigns, 
questioning our ability to sustain the Federation and ensure its success. Similarly, the launch of every major 
project was met with uncertainty and rumors from media campaigns. All these campaigns are history now and 
their promoters have been proven to be wrong. 
As for your suggestion of responding to these campaigns with tools and initiatives, including the development of 
local media, our response is to continue on our path of hard work and to highlight our achievements. Ongoing 
development has always and will remain a key objective to our local media: however, we will not allow anyone to 
drag us to media confrontations. Our policies and procedures are clear, transparent, and always in the end, truth 
will prevail and will defeat all rumors. 
Al Emarat Al Youm: 
The UAE government has taken notable measures in combating corruption, referring 
senior officials to court. Are there further steps the government intends to undertake in the 
same regards? And does Your Highness believe that an independent watchdog body might 
be needed to audit governmental and semi-governmental organizations? 
The UAE has efficient independent watchdog bodies that include the federal State Audit Institution, as well as 
local auditing departments. I've visited the State Audit Institution lately where I was updated on its activities. I've 
given directives to revamp its systems and provide all necessary tools to enhance its performance. Sy stems and 
processes of the Dubai Financial Audit Department are also being reviewed and enhanced. Besides. there are 
other auditing bodies that operate under the Rulers' Courts across the seven Emirates.
