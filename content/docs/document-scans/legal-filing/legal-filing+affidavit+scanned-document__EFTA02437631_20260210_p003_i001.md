refused to come here and to those who left this room in protest, I commend you. Yc 
up for moral clarity and you brought honor to your countries. 
But to those who gave this Holocaust-denier a hearing, I say on behalf of my peopf 
Jewish people, and decent people everywhere: Have you no shame? Have you no 
A mere six decades after the Holocaust, you give legitimacy to a man who denies t 
murder of six million Jews took place and pledges to wipe out the Jewish state. 
What a disgrace! What a mockery of the charter of the United Nations! Perhaps so 
think that this man and his odious regime threaten only the Jews. You're wrong. 
History has shown us time and again that what starts with attacks on the Jews ever 
ends up engulfing many others. 
This Iranian regime is fueled by an extreme fundamentalism that burst onto the wo; 
three decades ago after lying dormant for centuries. In the past thirty years, this far 
has swept the globe with a murderous violence and cold-blooded impartiality in its 
victims. It has callously slaughtered Moslems and Christians. Jews and Hindus, an( 
others. Though it is comprised of different offshoots, the adherents of this unforgivi 
seek to return humanity to medieval times. 
Wherever they can, they impose a backward regimented society where women, mi 
gays or anyone not deemed to be a true believer is brutally subjugated. The struggl 
this fanaticism does not pit faith against faith nor civilization against civilization. 
It pits civilization against barbarism, the 21st century against the 9th century, those 
sanctify life against those who glorify death. 
The primitivism of the 9th century ought to be no match for the progress of the 21s.
The allure of freedom, the power of technology, the reach of communications shou 
win the day. Ultimately, the past cannot triumph over the future. And the future offe 
nations magnificent bounties of hope. The pace of progress is growing exponentiall 
It took us centuries to get from the printing press to the telephone, decades to get f 
telephone to the personal computer, and only a few years to get from the personal 
to the internet. 
What seemed impossible a few years ago is already outdated, and we can scarcely 
the changes that are yet to come. We will crack the genetic code. We will cure the 
We will lengthen our lives. We will find a cheap alternative to fossil fuels and clean 
planet. 
I am proud that my country Israel is at the forefront of these advances — by leading 
innovations in science and technology, medicine and biology, agriculture and water 
and the environment. These innovations the world over offer humanity a sunlit futu 
unimagined promise. 
But if the most primitive fanaticism can acquire the most deadly weapons, the man 
history could be reversed for a time. And like the belated victory over the Nazis, nu 
progress and freedom will prevail only after an horrific toll of blood and fortune has 
exacted from mankind. That is why the greatest threat facing the world today is the 
between religious fanaticism and the weapons of mass destruction. 
The most urgent challenge facing this body is to prevent the tyrants of Tehran from 
nuclear weapons. Are the member states of the United Nations up to that challenge
