MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
The following is a summary of material US. federal income tax considerations relating to our 
qualification as a REIT and relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our 
common stock. Because this is a summary that is intended to address only certain material U.S. federal 
income tax consequences relating to the ownership and disposition of our common stock generally 
applicable to holders, it may not contain all the information that may be important to you. As you 
review this discussion, you should keep in mind that: 
• the tax consequences to you may vary depending on your particular tax situation; 
• special rules that are not discussed below may apply to you if, for example, you are a broker-
dealer, a trust, an estate, a regulated investment company, a REIT, a financial institution, an 
insurance company, a person who holds 10% or more (by vote or value) of our stock, a person 
holding their interest through a partnership or similar pass-through entity, a person subject to 
the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code, a person holding our common stock as part 
of a "straddle," "hedge," "short sale," "conversion transaction," "synthetic security" or other 
integrated investment, a person who marks-to-market our common stock, a U.S. expatriate, a 
U.S. stockholder (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the US. dollar or are 
otherwise subject to special tax treatment under the Code; 
• this summary dots not address state, local or non-U.S. tax considerations; 
• this summary assumes that stockholders hold our common stock as a "capital asset" within the 
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code; 
• this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to tax-exempt 
organizations and non-US. persons, except to the limited extent described below; and 
• this discussion is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, tax advice. 
You are urged both to review the following discussion and to consult with your own tax advisor to 
determine the effect of ownership and disposition of our common stock on your particular tax 
situation, including any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences. 
For purposes of this discussion, references to "we," "us" or "our," and any similar terms, refer 
solely to American Farmland Company and not our operating partnership. 
The information in this section is based on the current Code, current, temporary and proposed 
lleasury Regulations, the legislative history of the Code, current administrative interpretations and 
practices of the IRS, including its practices and policies as endorsed in private letter rulings, which arc 
not binding on the IRS except in the case of the taxpayer to whom a private letter ruling is addressed, 
and existing court decisions. Future legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations and court 
decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law, possibly 
with retroactive effect. Any change could apply retroactively. We have not obtained any rulings from 
the IRS concerning the tax treatment of the matters discussed below. Thus, it is possible that the IRS 
could challenge the statements in this discussion that do not hind the IRS or the courts and that a 
court could agree with the IRS. 
Classification and Taxation of American Farmland Company as a REIT 
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code beginning 
with the taxable year ended December 31, 2012. A REIT generally is not subject to US. federal 
income tax on the income that it distributes to stockholders if it meets the applicable REIT distribution 
requirements and other requirements for qualification. We believe that we have been organized and 
operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code
