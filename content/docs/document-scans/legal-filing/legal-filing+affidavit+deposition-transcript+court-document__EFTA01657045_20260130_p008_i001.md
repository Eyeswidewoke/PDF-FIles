me what happened, and without waiting for me to ask questions. I won't be asking you 
many questions, so you'll be doing most of the talking. I'm interested to know what 
happened to you, so I'm here mainly to listen to you."), 
(b) asking open-ended questions, and (c) not interrupting witnesses during their narrative 
responses. 
Allowing victims to take a more active role in the interview should not only increase the amount 
of information gathered, but, by giving the witness a voice in the investigative process, it should 
also promote a sense of self-efficacy and control over the interview process. By contrast, the 
traditional police-dominated interview simply relegates victims to continue playing a passive 
role in which they have little control. Just the opposite of the desired effect occurs when police 
interviewers interrupt witnesses in the middle of their narration, as it makes witnesses, and 
especially victims, feel like they have even less control over the interview process. It also 
frustrates witnesses and victims by making it difficult for them to narrate their story and to 
communicate all of their information. 
Unburdening the Victim: Witnesses, and especially victims, may feel that they were partially 
responsible for the crime, witnesses because they did not intervene and victims because they may 
have placed themselves in compromising situations. Such counter-factual thinking (What would 
have happened had I done ....?) is common, but not productive or healthy. Nevertheless, 
interviewers must deal effectively with any feelings of inadequacy that may arise, and especially 
with victims. If victims hint at such thoughts, interviewers need to assure them that it is the 
perpetrator's behavior that is in question, not the victim's. Second, interviewers must guard 
against inducing such feelings of inadequacy by not making judgmental comments such as "Why 
were you walking in that area?" or more subtly, formulating questions in a negative tone, "You 
don't recall his name, do you?" Such negative questioning may reinforce the victim's sense of 
inadequacy. The form of the question also allows, the victim to answer the question easily with a 
"No" response rather than encouraging a deep search through memory. 
Communication 
Interviewers must communicate their professional, investigative needs to the witness, and, in 
turn, witnesses must communicate their knowledge of the crime to the interviewer. Ineffective 
communication will lead witnesses to withhold valuable information or to provide irrelevant, 
imprecise or incorrect answers. 
Promoting Extensive, Detailed Responses. Police interviews are unusual in that they require 
witnesses to describe events in more detail than civilians normally do in casual conversation. 
Inducing such an extraordinary level of description requires that interviewers convey this goal 
explicitly, which they rarely do. To compound the problem, witnesses often withhold 
information because they do not know what is relevant for a police investigation. To minimize 
witnesses' withholding information, interviewers should instruct them to report everything they 
think about, whether it is trivial, out of chronological order, or even if it contradicts a statement 
made earlier. If contradictions arise within a witness's testimony, interviewers should wait until
