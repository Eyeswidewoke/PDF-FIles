&nbs=; david , what if instead of this signed by ken starr. &n=sp; if you felt inspired as you were not part of the 
defense team an= re worked this into a pro prosecutor piece for the wash post. 
"Sweethear= deal!" So goes the attack on the resolution of the more than a decade ago federal investigation 
involving our client Jeffrey Epstein. The=20 attack is profoundly misplaced, supported neither by the law nor the facts. 
Nor is it supported by the structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, Jeffrey was subjected to an extremely 
aggressive federal intrusion into what would typically be considered a quintessentially local criminal matter in south 
Florida. The&nbs=;offense investigated — at its core, sexual favors for hire — has long been treated=as a matter 
entrusted to laws of the several States, not the federal government. =20 The conduct — for which Jeffrey took full 
respo=sibility — was a classic state offense and was treated exactly that way by able, honest prosecutors in Palm Beach 
County. Nevertheless, without a reques= from the state prosecutors, the federal government intervened. For their o=n 
opportunistic reasons, many are now criticizing the federal decision-makers at the time, including now-Secretary of 
Labor Alex Acosta (then-United States Attorney in south Florida), for not going far enough. 
The critics are wrong on the facts and the law. They also ignore a fact going to the heart of fundamental fairness: 
In the decade since =aying his debt to society, Jeffrey Epstein has led a life characterized by responsible citizenship, 
numerous acts of generosity and good deeds.=/div> 
Here are the true key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made=20 businessman with no prior criminal 
history whatsoever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounted to solicitation of prostitution. That conduct was wrong 
and a violation of Flo=ida state law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs or the like were=20 involved, some 
of the women he paid were under the age of 18. Those facts were carefully assessed by experienced state sex crime 
prosecutors who aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turn=d a blind eye to potential offenses to the public 
order. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive fifteen-month investigation, led 
by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by the state grand jury on a=20 single felony 
count of solicitation of prostitution. 
During that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met 
face-to-face with many of the asserted=20 victims, considered their credibility — or lack thereof — a=d considered the 
extent of exculpatory evidence, including sworn testimony&nb=p;from many that they lied about being eighteen years 
old to be allowed into Mr. Epstein's home. After months of negotiations, the state prose=utors believed they had 
reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest — a resolution entirely consistent w=th 
that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants. The syst=m worked as it should have. 
Then, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office extensively an= aggressively investigated whether 
Mr. Epstein had engaged in a commercial human trafficking ring, targeted minors, or used the intern=t or traveled 
interstate in the process. But that's not w=at this was and that's not what happened. That is precisely why&=bsp;the 
federal authorities' ultimate decision to defer prosecution to the sta=e was the right one. 
However, the federally-demanded resolution was not without conditions. The federal prosecutors insisted on 
various unorthodox requirements that M=. Epstein's experienced defense team had never seen imposed on any=20 
defendant anywhere. Under the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was required to request that the state prosecutors 
demand the impositi=n of a thirty-month sentence that included both jail time and=the strictest conditions of probation: 
lifetime sex-offender registration. Those draconian measures were far more than warranted by the state gra=d jury's 
indictment and would not have otherwise been required =nder the previously agreed-upon state disposition. As part of 
this highly unusu=l deal, the government required Jeffrey to pay for a highly experi=nced group of attorneys to bring 
claims against him on behalf of a governme=t list of asserted victims. Jeffrey was required to waive the right to challenge 
those claims without being provided the asserted victim's=20 identities by the government until after he was 
incarcerated. Importantly, the feds' decision to decline prosecution in deference to the state in exchange for these
