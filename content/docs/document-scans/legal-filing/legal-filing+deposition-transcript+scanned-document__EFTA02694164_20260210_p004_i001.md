flower shapes and recurring forms in the 20th-century cutouts of Henri Matisse. The resemblance is no fluke: the art 
of French Gothic glass is an art of color-design, of colored forms arranged on flat surfaces to represent stylized 
human beings and their paraphernalia, but with no attempt to suggest depth. French glass of the 12th and 13th 
centuries is as close to the 20th century fauves as Chartres is to Paris. 
But these famous pre-tracery roses are not quite recursive: They are made of recurring forms, but the larger shapes 
do not contain the smaller ones; each smaller shape is distinct and set apart--which underlines a point that is often 
overlooked. It is difficult to accomplish, in the high-tech medium of tracery, an effect that is merely routine in any old 
12th-century composite window: a design made of distinct shapes clearly separated by a neutral background--as in 
the north rose at Laon or the west at Chartres. 
Tracery makes recursive compositions easy, but this older type of design becomes difficult. As tracery tended to 
displace the older-type window (among other things, tracery windows were cheaper) the loss to art was real. The 
composite roses at the top of each clerestory bay at Chartres, for example, might well be the most perfect roses 
ever designed. But by 1220 they were old-fashioned, technologically obsolete. 
A final large-scale example: Some English Gothic churches have two transepts, a small eastern transept along with 
the main one. (Examples include Salisbury. Canterbury, Wells, Lincoln, Worcester and Southwell Cathedrals, as 
well as Beverley Minster.) The east end of a medieval church was ordinarily separated from the rest by a screen; 
the monks, canons, or other officiating priests wanted to chant the liturgy and celebrate mass in peace, shut off from 
nosy, noisy laymen. The extra transept turned the eastern part of the building into a priestly church in itself, with its 
own small transept. 
This plan is inherently recursive: A large two-transept plan includes within it a smaller one-transept church. This 
recursive pattern yields the beautifully faceted, gem-like east end of Salisbury Cathedral. Salisbury's telescoping 
east end recalls the upward-telescoping structure of Bourges. 
What do we gain by studying these many, varied instances of one basic design idea? The designers themselves 
had no idea of "recursive structure," at least not explicitly. But artists as a rule are too close to their own work to see 
any but the most obvious underlying themes or principles. A design impulse that appears in many forms in many 
artists' work is especially unlikely to be detected from the ground. 
We need to soar years (or centuries) overhead and look at the era as a whole. When we do--when we notice such 
principles as recursive structure—the result is a clearer view of the spirit of the age, its artistic character, and the 
source of its vibrancy and integrity. 
Recursive structure is by no means limited to Gothic. One of the most important developments in the whole range of 
post-Gothic architecture is Michelangelo's invention of the giant order, which vastly increased the expressive power 
of neo-classical design by introducing a kind of recursive structure. Tall columns or pilasters (the "giant order) span 
a deep vertical space containing stacked-up, shallower layers, each spanned by shorter columns or pilasters. And 
there is no neater demonstration of recursion than Brunelleschi's at Santo Spirito in Florence, where the domed, 
four-posted canopy over the altar at the crossing mirrors the domed crossing itself. 
But the placid elegance of Santo Spirito gives us a hint about recursion's unique place in Gothic. As he mastered 
this radical new aesthetic vocabulary, the Gothic artist wanted his building to come alive, to throb with life. He 
wanted wave after wave of decoration to turn his building from a dead pile of stone to a live forest, with the sun 
screened through windows as colorful and intricate as a jungle canopy. Recursion is fundamental to Gothic art 
because it creates ordered profusion--profusion insofar as one can push the nest of form-within-form as deep as 
one likes; ordered and not chaotic insofar as the forms on each scale mirror the forms above and below. Recursion 
allows the Gothic artist to plant life in the smallest niche and tightest corner of his building, to push the level of 
decorative detail and aliveness to the finest scale his tools can reach. 
We see recursion in Gothic buildings that are overgrown with sinuous, organic decoration built of abstract leaves, 
petals, and elegant compound curves, where large petals are built of smaller petals, which are built of smaller 
petals, which are built of still-smaller ones.
