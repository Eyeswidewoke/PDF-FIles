The plane would have arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport at 6:01 =.M. on Sunday, May 15. That morning, he would 
have given his BlackBerry, assuming he still =ad possession of it, to security experts arranged by his advisor Stephane 
Fouks. Two months =arlier, his security team had installed encryption software on the phone, but then, for an =nknown 
reason, the phone began to fail, so the software had recently =een removed. But he now feared his phone had been 
compromised, and, if the experts found concrete evidence of =ophisticated tampering, he would know that he was 
under surveillance and take appropriate counter =easures. 
Because DSK had a 3:00 P.M. appointment with German Chancellor =ngela Merkel, he would then have boarded a 
fight to Berlin that morning. Merkel does not =ften hold meetings on Sunday, but DSK had insisted on it when he was in 
Washington, DC. He =rgently needed to discuss "Comprehensive," the code name for a secret plan he had =een working 
on at the IMF to avert the Greek financial crisis. The plan essentially provided an IMF =ask for the members of the euro 
zone to absorb the entire Greek =overnment debt 
DSK knew that Germany was the key to solving the Greek problem: =nce Germany agreed to his plan, Sarkozy, who 
0SK knew enjoyed dramatic =escues, would join Merkel. The other countries in the euro zone would =ollow suit. Over 
the past year, DSK had developed a close working =elationship with Merkel. They could discuss their complex issues in 
=erman, a language he was fluent in. He also understood the German =bhorrence to incurring debt that could not be 
repaid. As he explored =he political scenario with Merkel that January, it had become clear to =im that Merkel would 
need time to overcome this barrier. 
But time was running out that Spring. Yes, he agreed with her, =reece was only two percent of the economy of the 
euro zone, but even =o this unpayable debt was a "cancer" that, if allowed to metastasize, would destroy credibility in 
the financial =arkets of other member countries, including Spain, Italy, and Portugal, and could unravel the =ntire euro 
zone. Greece could not solve the problem itself: No matter how much it cut =xpenditures, it could not repay the debt, 
which would only grow as interest rates rose. Providing Greece =ith loans was also not the answer. So pragmatism had 
to replace ideology. 
This was not just a dilemma in which there were two =hoices—increased debt or increased austerity. DSK termed it a 
"trilemma," because the seventeen-nation =uro zone, which shared a common currency, the euro, and a common 
central bank, the European =entral Bank (ECB), lacked the political means to enforce any decisions it made. The ECB 
=ould loan money on various conditions, but, as Greece was sovereign, it could not =uarantee that they would be carried 
out. Yet, if the euro zone made it =vident to the marketplace that it could not solve such problems, the =financial players 
in the market would realize that the other heavily =ndebted countries, such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal, could also 
=efault. The contagion would spread, interest rates would soar, banks =ould be unable to retain their deposits, 
governments would topple, and =he fragile financial edifice of the euro zone would collapse. 
Merkel understood this "trilemma," but that did not make it any =ess politically repugnant to ask German taxpayers to 
pay for Greek over-spending. Her finance =inister, Wolfgang Schauble, had taken the position that if there was to be a 
bailout, =his should be accomplished by the private holders of Greek debt, most of which were German and French 
=anks, writing off part of what was owed them, rather than by governments using money paid by =heir taxpayers. But 
that would lead to an effective default, and negotiating with banks =ould itself add to the growing unease in the 
marketplace. 
DSK had the pragmatic solution. Since the amount of money involved =as then relatively small—about 60 to 70 billion 
euros—most of it could be =aid by Germany, France, and 
other euro zone members, with a small portion paid by the banks. The =lternative was that the 
contagion would spread to Spain and Italy and become an unsolvable =ulti-trillion-euro problem. 
Then, that May, the Greek finance minister George Papaconstantinou =roposed a quixotic program under which Greece 
would raise 50 billion euros by privatizing =overnment assets such as airports and monuments. This was so unrealistic 
that the market =eared an imminent default. 
The credit rating services, led by Moody's, moved toward cutting =reece's credit into junk territory. This in itself would 
make it too expensive for Greece to =orrow to refinance its debt, which was coming due. Nor could Greece print money, 
since it had ceded =hat power, as had all the other members in the euro zone, to the ECB. And the ECB made it =tear 
that it was not allowed to subsidize a member. So Europe was now at a dangerous =mpasse. 
DSK had meanwhile fine-tuned his "Comprehensive" plan to conform to =he political restraints that were holding 
Germany back. Euro zone members, led by =ermany, would replace most of the unpayable part of the Greek debt with 
Eurobonds. The =alance would come from the banks, which would agree to a voluntary haircut, and a token amount 
=ould come from Greece.
