DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITARY SHARES 
General 
We may. at our option, elect to offer depositary shares, representing fractional interests in debt securities or 
fractional shares of our common stock or a particular series of our preferred stock, as described below. In the 
event we elect to do so, depositary receipts evidencing depositary shares will be issued to the public. 
The interests in a security of a particular series of debt securities or shares of common stock or any class or 
series of preferred stock represented by depositary shares will be deposited under a deposit agreement among us, 
a depositary selected by us and the holders of the depositary receipts. The depositary will be a bank or trust 
company having its principal office in the United States and having a combined capital and surplus of at least 
$50,000,000. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each owner of a depositary share will be entitled, in 
proportion to the applicable fraction of a debt security or share of common stock or preferred stock represented 
by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the debt security, common stock or preferred stock, 
as the case may be, represented by the depositary share, including dividend, voting, conversion, redemption, 
sinking fund. repayment at maturity, subscription and liquidation rights. 
The depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts issued pursuant to the deposit agreement. 
Depositary receipts will be distributed to those persons purchasing the fractional interests in debt securities or 
fractional shares of common stock or preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the offering described in the 
related prospectus supplement. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to copies of the 
forms of deposit agreement and depositary receipt filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this 
prospectus forms a part. 
Pending the preparation of definitive depositary receipts, the depositary may, upon our written order, issue 
temporary depositary receipts substantially identical to, and entitling the holders thereof to all the rights 
pertaining to. the definitive depositary receipts but not in definitive form. Definitive depositary receipts will be 
prepared thereafter without unreasonable delay, and temporary depositary receipts will be exchangeable for 
definitive depositary receipts without charge to the holder thereof. 
Dividends and Other Distributions 
The depositary will distribute all payments of interest, cash dividends or other cash distributions received in 
respect of the debt securities, common stock or class or series of preferred stock. as the case may be, to the record 
holders of depositary shares relating to such debt securities, common stock or class or series of preferred stock in 
proportion to the number of such depositary shares owned by such holders. 
In the event of a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the 
record holders of depositary shares entitled thereto, unless the depositary determines that it is not feasible to 
make such distribution, in which case the depositary may, with our approval, sell such property and distribute the 
net proceeds from such sale to such holders. 
Redemption of Depositary Shares 
Whenever we redeem a debt security, common stock or preferred stock held by the depositary, the 
depositary will redeem as of the same redemption date the number of depositary shares representing interests in 
the debt securities or shares of the common stock or preferred stock so redeemed. The redemption price per 
depositary share will be equal to the applicable fraction of the redemption price per debt security or share of 
common stock or preferred stock, as the case may be, payable with respect to such redeemed series of debt 
securities, common stock or preferred stock. If less than all the depositary shares are to be redeemed, the 
depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by lot or pro rata, as may be determined by the depositary.
