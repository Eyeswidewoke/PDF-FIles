$1,000,000 has been raised through the Offering, $1,000,000 of proceeds from the Offering will 
be used to purchase certain business and assets (including the assignment of certain contracts) 
from VPI that were developed by VPI in anticipation of initiating the Company's business plan (if 
less than $1,000,000 is raised in the Offering, half of the amount raised will be paid to VPI as a 
partial payment of the $1,000,000 purchase price for the business and assets to be purchased from 
VPI, with the balance of such purchase price to be paid over time from future funding or from any 
net revenues the Company generates). The business and assets of VPI that are to be acquired by 
the Company include a completed infomercial (for which VPI expended approximately $625,000), 
a finished website and established back office operations (for which VPI expended approximately 
$300,000) and the assignment of license and similar agreements with physicians who have already 
signed up to join the Company's group of member physicians and pursuant to which agreements 
such physicians have committed to pay licensing or similar fees in an aggregate amount of in 
excess of $650,000. 
The price to be paid by the Company to VPI for such business and assets has not been 
established based upon any objective criteria or independent appraisal or on an arm's-length basis, 
and no assurance can be given that the price to be paid by the Company to VPI for such business 
and assets is a fir or market price. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the contracts that 
are intended to be acquired by the Company as part of the business and assets being transferred 
from VPI will be assignable to the Company — if they are not assignable, the Company may not be 
able to receive any benefits from those contracts. 
The Company has limited capital for operations and expects to need to raise more money to 
continue develop and operate its business. 
Even if the Offering is fully subscribed and all of the Units offered hereby are sold, the 
Company may need more capital in order to fund the launching and marketing of its products and 
services and otherwise to implement its business plans. No assurance can be given that the 
Company will be able to raise more capital, on terms favorable to the Company or at all. If the 
Company does not raise the required capital to commence or continue it operations, it would not 
likely have any business. In any event, the Subscriber and other investors in the Offering are likely 
to be totally dependent upon the ability of the Company to raise additional funds to the extent the 
Company is not able to generate revenues sufficient to fund its operations and growth. 
The Subscriber and other current investors are likely to suffer immediate dilution in their 
ownership in the Company. 
The Company has no significant assets, and upon investment by an investor, the book 
value of the any Underlying Shares that would be issued to such investor upon such investor's 
conversion or exercise of his Constituent Securities would be substantially less than their purchase 
price. Investors in the Company may face substantial additional dilution resulting from future 
equity offerings or in connection with acquisitions. In connection with future financings, the 
Company may offer shares of Common Stock or other securities at an effective price less than 
the conversion price provided in the Debentures or the exercise price provided for in the Warrants 
and/or on terms that are otherwise more favorable than those available in the Offering (including, 
without limitation, the issuance of convertible preferred stock that would have a conversion rate 
higher than that provided for under the Debentures, that would have a higher dividend rate than 
the interest rate provided for in the Debenture, that would be granted priority over shares of 
Common Stock as to dividends and/or upon liquidation and that would have superior voting
