3. Things "they" do not want us to know 
- History: can we open and fully access our government vaults after a =ew decades, to find out what was really going on 
behind the scenes? Can =e integrate and report on the things that accidentally become public =nowledge now (such as 
the background of Benghazi, the leaked US cables, =he organization of the Arab spring or the Orange Revolution in the 
=kraine) to get a more nuanced and accurate model of history, and better =rojections for present and future? Some 
topics are probably =eliberately and perhaps permanently obscured for policy reasons, such =s the death toll of 
Chernobyl. Can we start serious and objective =esearch efforts into such topics? 
- Finance, wealth, ownership: It is debatable whether it is in the =nterest of society to have an accurate public model of 
wealth =istribution, of the actual dynamics of the monetary systems, the =ecision making hierarchies and responsibilities 
etc. However, it is =ertainly important to have such a model within the academic and policy =dvisory bodies. 
- Administration, power dynamics and mass control: Democracy is an =mportant invention to stabilize societies, but the 
democratic narrative =s not well-aligned with how our societies actually work. (It is also =ot clear that a thoroughly 
democratic society could work beyond the =cale of a city state, like Iceland.) The techniques to control and =lign large 
groups of people seem to be largely informal, and the =ynamics that make leaders, popstars, gurus, ideas and ideologies 
=opular or hated appear mysterious, instead of being properly analyzed. 
4. Things that are not well-aligned with scientific careers 
Scientific paradigms develop specific methodologies and thereby diverge. =hen the methodology does not fit the 
question, we often need to start =ew paradigms, which threaten the investment of competing scientists =nto their 
existing methodology. As a result, many sciences stick with =ethodologies that make progress on their original question 
very hard: =sychology, neuroscience, sociology, parts of fundamental physics and =inguistics seem to be stuck, yet 
radical breaks with current =ethodologies are often seen as heresy. Paradoxically, the aversion is =arger when the 
science is under stress (i.e. unproductive), while a =roductive, successful field seems to have a high tolerance of novelty 
=nd diversity. 
5. Things that are outside of the Overton Window 
Every society has a range of acceptable opinions. Science tries to be =eutral, i.e. the value of statement is entirely given 
by the evidence =hat supports it, yet a science that explores statements that conflict =ith societal narratives puts 
researchers at risk. Genetics and la =ender and sexuality, markets vs. regulation, autism and nerdculture, =ome to 
mind. 
In this category are also evidence based crime prevention (are prisons =n effective way to reduce crime? how can we 
establish a feedback loop =etween the legal code and its application, and the results they have on =ociety?), evidence 
based poverty reduction, evidence based treatment of =ddiction, and evidence based analysis of benefits of diversity in 
the =orkplace. In all these areas, our policies tend to be dictated by our =alues, not by the consequences of the 
implementation of the policies =ith respect to our preferred outcomes. 
6. Things that are (relatively) harmless, but forbidden 
Germline modification, cloning, extended PID etc. will likely not have =armful effects on the whole of society if they are 
studied at a very =mall scale, and have the potential for great progress in healthcare, =ognitive science, nutrition science 
and other fields. These studies =ause a visceral reaction in most people, because they are not only =utlawed, but seem 
to change our identity as a species. It is hard to =uantify this damage and to weight it against the benefits.
