Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Cerberus and the members of the Cerberus-led Consortium may also pursue, for 
its own members' accounts, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition 
opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the Cerberus-led Consortium continues to own a significant amount of the 
outstanding shares of our common stock through Albertsons Investor and Kimco, the Cerberus-led Consortium will continue to be able to 
strongly influence or effectively control our decisions, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant 
corporate transactions. 
We will incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company. 
After the completion of this offering, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the 'Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations of the stock market on which our common stock is traded. 
Being subject to these rules and regulations will result in additional legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, will make some 
activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and may also place significant strain on management, systems and resources. 
These laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director 
and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to 
obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified 
persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy 
our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action 
and potentially civil litigation. 
We are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, 
exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders 
of companies that are subject to such requirements. 
Upon completion of this offering, Albertsons Investor, Kimco and Management Holdco, as a group, will control a majority of our 
outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the NYSE rules. Under the NYSE rules, a 
company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a "controlled company" and 
may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including: 
the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors; 
the requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent 
directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; 
the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written 
charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and 
the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation 
committees. 
Following this offering, we intend to utilize these exemptions. As a result, we will not have a majority of independent directors nor 
will our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you 
will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance 
requirements.
