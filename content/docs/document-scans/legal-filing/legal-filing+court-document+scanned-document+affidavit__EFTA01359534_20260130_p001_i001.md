shall not entitle the holder to any rights of a shareholder, except as therein provided. 
Section 2 -- Lost or Destroyed Certificates: 
The holder of any certificate representing shares of the Corporation shall immediately notify the 
Corporation of any loss or destruction of the certificate representing the same. The Corporation 
may issue a new certificate in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have 
been lost or destroyed. On production of such evidence of loss or destruction as the Board of 
Directors in its discretion may require, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require the 
owner of the lost or destroyed certificate, or his legal representatives, to give the corporation a bond 
in such sum as the Board may direct, and with such surety or sureties as may be satisfactory to the 
Board, to indemnify the Corporation against any claim, loss, liability or damage it may suffer on 
account of the issuance of the new certificate. A new certificate may be issued without requiring 
any such evidence or bond when, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, it is proper so to do. 
Section 3 -- Transfer of Shares:

transfer endorsed thereon or delivered therewith, duly executed, with such proof of the authenticity 
of the signature and of authority to transfer and of payment of transfer taxes as the Corporation or its 
agents may require. 
(b) 
The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares as the 
absolute owner thereof for all purposes and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any legal, 
equitable or other claim to or interest in, such share or shares on the pan of any other person, 
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided 
by law. 
Section 4 -- Record Date: 
In lieu of closing the share records of the Corporation, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a 
date not exceeding fifty (50) days, nor less than ten (10) days, as the record date for the 
determination of shareholders entitled to receive notice of, or to vote at, any meeting of 
shareholders, or to consent to any proposal without a meeting, or for the purpose of determining 
shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividends, or allotment of any rights, or for the 
purpose of any other action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for the determination of 
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of 
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if no notice is given, the 
day on which the meeting is held, except that the record date for determining the eligibility of shares
