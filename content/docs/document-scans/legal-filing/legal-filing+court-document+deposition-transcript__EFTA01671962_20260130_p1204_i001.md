does not meet all of the above requirements, crediting may be delayed and you may incur late payment fees and additional interest charges. 
Electronic payments must be made through an electronic payment method payable in USdollars and clearable through the US banking system. If 
we accept payment in a foreign currency, we will convert It into USdollars at a conversion rate that is acceptable to us, unless a particular rate is 
required by law. Please do not send post-dated checks as they will be deposited upon receipt. Any restrictive language on a payment we accept will 
have no effect on us without our express prior written approval. We will re-present to your financial Institution any payment that is returned unpaid. 
Permission fat Electronic Withdrawal: (I) When you send a check for payment, you ghee us permission to electronically withdraw your payment 
from your deposit or other asset account. We will process checks electronically by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number, account 
number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless thecheck is not processable electronically or a less costly process Is available. 
When we process your check electronically, your payment may be withdrawn from your deposit or other asset account as soon as the same day we 
receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your financial account statement. If we cannot collect the funds electronically 
we may issue a draft against your deposit or other asset account for the amount of the check. (2) By using Pay By Computer, Pay By Phone or any 
other electronic payment service of ours, you give us permission to electronically withdraw funds from the deposit or other asset account you specify 
In the amount you request. Payments using such services of ours received after 8:00 p.m. MST may not be credited until the next day. 
How We Cakuiate Your Balance: We use the Average Daily Balance (ADS) method (including new transactions) to cakulate the balance on which 
we charge interest for Pay Over Time balances on your Account. Call the Customer Care number listed below for more information about this 
balance computation method and how resulting interest charges are determined. The method we use to figure the AD8 and interest results in daily 
compounding of Interest. 
Paying Interest:If you have a Pay Over Time balance, your due date It at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. We will begin charging 
interest on transactions added to a Pay Over Time balance as of the date they are added. However, we will not charge interest on charges added to a 
Pay Over Time balance automatically (for example, Sign & Travel and Extended Payment Option) if you pay the Account Total New Balance by the due 
date each month. 
Foreign Currency Charge: If you make a Charge in a foreign currency, we will convert it into US dollars on the date we or our agents process it. 
Wit will charge a fee of 2.70% of the converted US dollar amount. We will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date, unless a 
particular rate is required by law. The conversion rate we use is no more than the highest official rate published by a government agency or the 
highest interbank rate we identify from customary banking sources on the conversion date or the prior business day. This rate may differ from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments will be billed at the rates such establishments use. 
Credit Balance: A credit balance (designated CR) shown on this statement represents money owed to you. If within the six-month period following 
the date of the first statement indicating the credit balance you do not request a refund or charge enough to use up the credit balance, we will send 
you a check for the credit balance within 30days if the amount is $1.00 or more. To request a refund, contact us at the address or phone number as 
noted below for Customer Care & Billing Inquiries.
