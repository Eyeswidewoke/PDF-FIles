they knew Epstein was unaware of this relationship. Finally, as I had previously ruled, the 
r**439] complaint also alleges that Epstein acted upon this information and but for 
Citibank's actions he would not have been injured. 
[' 332] The basic purpose of Rule 9(b) has been fulfilled - plaintiff has alleged enough 
information, including specific names and dates, to put Citibank on notice of the fraudulent 
actions it has alleged to have committed. Moreover, since some of the misrepresentations 
were alleged to be omissions, [HN2] Rule 9 does not require specification of time, place, 
and nature of misrepresentation for these statements; rather, it requires only that the 
plaintiff identify the facts not communicated. See Golden Trade, S.R.L. v Jordache, 143 
F.R.D. 504 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); Cottman Transmission Sys. Inc. v. Dubinsky, 95 F.R.D. 351, 
353 (E.D. Pa. 1982) ("Conduct which never occurred cannot be described with greater 
particularity other than to state that it did not occur.") 
The information contained in the second amended complaint is enough for counts I, II, Ill, 
and VI to survive this motion to dismiss for failure to rim plead fraud with particularity 
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). 
B. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) 
The defendants also argue that 12(b)(6) mandates dismissal of the complaint for failure to 
state a claim upon which relief can be granted. To the extent that plaintiffs are attempting 
to reargue their previous motion to dismiss, I reiterate my ruling that Virgin Islands law 
governs this case, that the complaint adequately alleges that the defendants' wrongful 
conduct caused the plaintiffs' loses, and that plaintiffs' claims of breach of fiduciary duty 
and negligent misrepresentation should not be dismissed. Financial Trust Co., 268 F. 
Supp. 2d at 576. The only claims left to be decided are the fraud claims. 
[HN3] In order to state a claim for fraud, the plaintiff must prove "(1) a specific false 
representation of material fact; (2) knowledge by the person who made it that it was false; 
(3) ignorance of its falsity by the person to whom it was made; (4) the intention that it 
should be acted upon; and (5) that the plaintiff acted ("8] upon it to his damage."' 
Financial Trust Co., 268 F. Supp.2d at 575 (quoting Shapiro v. UJB Fin. Corp., 964 F.2d 
272, 284 (3d Cir. 1992)). 
The defendants base their argument that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which 
relief can be granted for fraud on their allegation that the alleged omission of the 
relationship between AIG and defendants was r"440] disclosed and thus the "bespeaks 
caution" doctrine applies to the case. Under this theory, when some risks are disclosed in 
documents, the documents "bespeak caution" to the investor and the investor cannot later 
premise a fraud claim on the events of which he has been warned. Kline v. First W. Gov't 
Sec., 24 F.3d 480, 489 (3d Cir. 1994). The defendants' claim that the Preliminary Offering 
Circular [the "pitch book"], which was allegedly given to Epstein, disclosed ongoing 
business relationships between Citibank and AIG and should invoke the "bespeaks 
caution" doctrine. 
I have previously ruled that whether the "pitch book" referenced in the amended complaint 
is the document that plaintiffs rely on is a disputed fact that precludes a Rule 12(b)(6) 
dismissal. Financial Trust Co., 268 F. Supp. 2d at 572. (**9] Nothing in any of the briefs 
have convinced me that the parties do not dispute which pitch book Epstein received, what
