Long or short, Mark G. Roberts? 
The Head of Real Estate Strategy and Research considers immediate and longer-term investment issues 
Could global non-listed real estate continue to outperform? 
523 According to MSCI, global non-listed ungeared property 
generated a total return of 9.9% in 2014. With real interest rates 
likely to stay low in historical terms, total returns are likely to 
remain ahead of their longer-term average of 7.5%. U.S. returns 
are benefiting from higher GDP growth while European returns 
are gaining from declining unemployment, rising tenant demand 
and limited new construction. Australia, South Korea and Japan 
are likely to enjoy above-average performance but decelerating 
economic growth poses a threat to Chinese property markets. 
Hong Kong and Singapore office markets have pricing risk. 
Are U.S. listed real-estate returns likely to prove as attractive? 
Listed real-estate investment trusts (REITs) utilize a higher 
degree of gearing which can increase the volatility of returns 
relative to the non listed market Between 1993 and 2014 there 
were 13 periods during which U.S. interest rates (as defined by 
the Treasury yield) were rising. During those periods, the S&P 
500 Index rose by an average of 10% while U.S. REITs increased 
by an average of 2.6% and the Barclays Aggregate U.S. Bond 
Index declined by 2.7%. In the year that followed a rate increase, 
however, REITs' returns averaged 16%, higher than the S&P 500 
Index's average total return of 9.7% and the Barclays Aggregate 
U.S. Bond Index's 9.6% return. The Implication is that, in the 
near term, U.S. REITs may prove volatile. 
But won't dividend yields help offset this? 
pea Higher dividend yields can serve to offset this volatility. 
FiElTs currently provide a very attractive dividend yield of 3.87% 
which exceeds both the S&P 500 Index dividend yield of 1.97% 
and the 10-year U.S.-Treasury yield of 2.42%.' This higher 
dividend yield can dampen downside risk and underpin future 
outperformance. In addition, we estimate U.S. REITs are trading 
at a 10% discount to their net asset value. 
Offers and sales of alternative investments are subject to 
regulatory requirements and such investments may be available 
only to investors who are 'Qualified Purchasers" as defined 
by the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 and "Accredited 
Investors" as defined in Regulation D of the 1933 Securities 
Act. Alternative investments may be speculative and involve 
significant risks including illiquidity, heightened potential for loss 
and lack of transparency. 
Is sustainability going to play an increasing role in property 
investment? 
After the advent of the internee in the mid-1990s, landlords 
quickly learned that the provision of intemet access was not an 
option to gain competitive advantage. Instead it was a required 
amenity necessary to avoid building obsolescence. Today, 
some of the same things can be said of sustainable building 
practices. Tenants, regulators and investors alike vie the 
benefits of sustainable building practices. Lower energy costs, 
more efficient use of water resources and the need to avoid 
overbuilding in lower-density areas will likely make sustainable 
practices commonplace and of continuing importance to 
investors.
More broadly, will technology have an impact on long-term 
infrastructure investing? 
Bea Yes - consider, for example, the interaction between 
climate-change policies in Europe and energy-storage, energy-
efficiency and zero-emission technologies Smart-grid systems 
will help boost the share of renewable energy capacity, by 
creating a more efficient energy network, aligning more closely 
peak demand and production. Although at an early stage, energy 
storage has a positive long-term outlook to address the problems 
of grid bottlenecks and intermittent renewable power with 
implications for infrastructure investment.
