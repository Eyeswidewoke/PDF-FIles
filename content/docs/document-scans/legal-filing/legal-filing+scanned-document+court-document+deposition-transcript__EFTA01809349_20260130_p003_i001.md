tense after 2013. 
In 2013, the US, which is reluctant to take action for a military operation against Iran in 
2012, will have to address the stronger Israeli stance and policies. It is certain that 
Israel, which sees the nuclear 
capacity of Iran as a threat to its security and national integrity is not satisfied that 
Washingtonbs policies see diplomatic negotiations as a necessity. 
Israelbs basic concern at this point is that lranbs existing nuclear policy could advance. 
For Iran, which will likely become successful in its nuclear program, the Israeli weapons 
and missile systems will 
not be harmful to its nuclear arsenal. In addition to the probable repercussions of the 
Arab Spring, the Israeli predicament is further affected by the democratization efforts 
and demands in the region. This is one of the reasons why Israel, after losing its 
allies and friends in the region after the Arab Spring, views Iran as the only enemy. 
A probable Israeli-Iran conflict in 2013 can become a turning point for the current 
policies of the US vis-C-vis Israel. This could dramatically affect Israeli-American 
relations in the aftermath of 2013. 
However, the probable attitude of Turkey as a rising star that assumes lead roles in 
NATO, in a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict is not reviewed or evaluated in the 2013 
American policies. Turkeybs growing role is shown by the fact that a possible Israeli 
attack against Iran in 2013 is as tied to the NATO Anti-missile Sheild System in 
KC<recik as it is to American elections.

The Evolution of Saudi Security and Enforcement Policies on Communication 
Naef Bin Ahmed Al-Saud 
B 
April 2012 -- Communication, including social media, is vital to Saudi policy 
concemse.rsuant to both national and internal security. The evolution of Saudi security policy on communication and social media 
is being derived to a significant extent from recent external precedents. particularly government actions in the United States and Great Bream, as 
well as India, Israel, and other countries. The consensus among such countnes appears to be that anbterronsm 
and other ant:crime objecbves, including public safely. civil order. and governmental alleviation of economic hardship, take precedence over 
political notions such as democracy. 
Despite broadly analogous restrictions under American. British, Indian. and Israel, laws and government actions. some an the West seem to 
romanticize social media as a tool for protest in Saudi Arabia. It 
is therefore ironic that by md•2011, social media in Arnenca. Europe. and Israel expedited the organization of large illegal protests by citizens 
against their own governments, as a function of economic deprivation that could not be adequately resolved by 
political activates associated with democracy. In recent years. Saudi government policies have focused on economic development intended in 
part to address the concerns of its citizens. which has so far tangentially preempted widespread social mediaborgaria0 
unrest that other countries have begun to experience. 
This article argues that Saudi Arabia and many Other nations have found that Communication access. isethcularly including social media and the
