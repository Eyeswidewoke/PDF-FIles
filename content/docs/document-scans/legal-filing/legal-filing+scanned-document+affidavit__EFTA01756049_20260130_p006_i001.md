circ=mstances of perhaps the most anti-American regime in the world for the pas= 35 years, and uninterested in the 
leverage on Iran now potentially within Washington's grasp after decades=of enduring terrorist, nuclear and missile 
threats from Tehran's securit= services. 
The willful avertin= by the Administration of its gaze from these and other core dynamics at p=ay in and around Syria is 
certain to shape regional perceptions of America= power for years to come. Funding copious humanitarian assistance, 
already $1.3 billion and counting, for the fleein= victims of Russian-armed Syrian forces or Iranian-armed fighters, 
worthy =s that is, will not indemnify the US against the erosion of its superpower=reputation. 
Negotiations with I=an—How to Avert War and Build American Influence 
American politician=, including President Obama, have been justified in pledging to do whateve= it takes to keep Iran 
from obtaining nuclear weapons. Cold War notions of='containment' may offer no assurance of stability in the volatile 
Middle East, where in contrast to Kremlin lea=ers during the Cold War, surviving a nuclear exchange may not be a 
priorit= for many extremist aggressors. As recently as September 30, the State Dep=rtment 
<http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/09/214962.h=m> reiterated 
<http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/09/214962.htm> the official US view that "We're not go=ng to allow Iran to 
create a nuclear weapon." 
The carefully engin=ered June election of Hassan Rouhani as president of Iran, and this regime=stalwart's genial pursuit 
of détente with the US and normalized foreig= relations with others, have challenged Washington to respond with 
comparable tactical skill and strategic purpose= Some observers—press photographers, at the very least—were 
disappoint=d when President Obama's opportunity to greet President Rouhani personal=y at the UN in September did 
not materialize. Mr. Obama's telephone call to Mr. Rouhani as the latter headed for the a=rport to return to Iran was a 
hospitable gesture regardless of one's pol=cy view of Iran, a privilege US presidents can exercise as a consequence o= 
hosting the United Nations on American soil. 
Yet the ensuing pre=s statements by White House aides promoted the disturbing theme that, just=as Secretary Kerry 
had met with Iranian foreign minister Zarif in New York= President Obama had made a connection with his own 
"counterpart," talking 'president to president' with =assan Rouhani. President Obama would have been well advised to 
initiate a =all the next morning to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Not only would that h=ve tested the sincerity of 
Tehran's apparent warming to the United States, it would have dispelled the damaging misimpr=ssion that an unelected 
religious autocrat holds a superior protocol rank =o the president of the United States. 
That Mr. Obama, in =is September 24 speech to the UN General Assembly and subsequently, cited = fatwa by the 
Supreme Leader without irony or caveat, as though this carri=d some recognized legal effect, only underscored the 
uncertainty about the new Iranian President's own author=ty to set national policy on the very matter to be negotiated. 
US and European dip=omats emerged from the initial mid-October nuclear talks in Geneva remarki=g on the change in 
Iran's posture from previous negotiations. Foreign Mi=ister Zarif reportedly engaged in detailed, substantive discussions 
about the nuclear program, and told the press afte=ward that "serious give-and-take has taken place." It is a welcome 
cha=ge, and administration officials are now seized with two entirely predicta=le tasks: eliciting from the Iranian side a 
set of commitments that the US and allies persuasively believe will=prevent a future nuclear weapons "breakout;" and 
offering Iran in retu=n a commitment to deliver an agreed level of sanctions relief. 
Lead US negotiator =endy Sherman, in congressional hearings before the initial Geneva session,=assured legislators that 
the President is pursuing a comprehensive agreeme=t, not interim steps wherein a partial lifting of sanctions could 
deflate international solidarity to pressure Ir=n economically before a satisfactory nuclear deal is reached. It is the 
co=rect approach. Yet the Administration now, predictably, finds itself caugh= in a two-front negotiation, needing to 
overcome deep skepticism and a backdrop of troubled relations not only =ith Tehran but with Capitol Hill.
