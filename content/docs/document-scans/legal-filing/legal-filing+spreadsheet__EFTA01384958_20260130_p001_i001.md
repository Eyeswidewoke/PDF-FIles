of $98,104 relating to our acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2014 (the second and larger tranche of 
Kimberly Vineyard and Falcon Farms), and $34,665 relating to our existing Golden Eagle Ranch property. 
Management and performance fees-related party increased by $865,409 due to higher total assets for 
purposes of the management fees and increased performance fees due to the higher funds from operations 
and capital appreciation generated in 2015. Such costs arc not expected to continue following the 
Internalization. Property operating expenses increased by $106,475 during the six months ended Junc 30, 
2015. Of the $106,475 increase in property operating expenses, $150,928 related to our acquisitions made in 
the fourth quarter of 2014 ($45,735 in management fees, $92.166 in real estate taxes, $9,644 in repairs and 
maintenance, and $3,382 in insurance) and $34,382 related to increased management fees commensurate 
with the increased revenues from our same-property portfolio. This was partially offset by property 
operating oasts incurred in 2014 relating to the Hawk Creek Ranch and Pintail Vineyards properties from 
which we were entitled to participating revenues related to leases assumed at the time the properties were 
purchased. As a result, our development properties incurred management fees and real estate taxes 
associated with this revenue in 2014. which ceased once the leases expired. These expenses are currently 
being capitalized, as these two properties arc under development. 
Total Other Expense 
Total other expense increased $171,463, or 416.89%, from $41,129 for the six months ended 
June 30, 2014 to $212,592 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in total other expense 
arises from interest paid on the original credit facility, which was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 
2014, and the increased deferred financing costs incurred in establishing the additional credit facility in 
the first quarter of 2015. 
Permanent Crop Segment 
Our permanent crop segment operating revenues for the periods presented were impacted by 
acquisitions made during the last quarter of 2014. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we 
have separately discussed the components of operating revenues and property-specific operating expenses 
for our same-property portfolio, which includes the first tranche for Kimberly Vineyard, Golden Eagle 
Ranch, Quail Run Vineyard and Blue Heron Farm, permanent crop farnts owned by us for the entirety of 
both periods presented. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we closed two acquisitions of permanent crop 
properties, Falcon Farms and a second and larger tranche for the Kimberly Vineyard property.
