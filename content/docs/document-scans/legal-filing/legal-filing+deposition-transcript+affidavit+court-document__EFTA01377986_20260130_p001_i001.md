such a transaction. This intention may cause IAC to not support transactions we wish to pursue that involve issuing shares of our common stock, including for 
capital raising purposes, as consideration for an acquisition or as equity incentives to our employees. The inability to pursue such transactions, if it occurs. 
may adversely affect our company. See "—IAC controls our company and will have the ability to control the direction of our business" and "—IAC's interests 
may conflict with our interests and the interests of our stockholders. Conflicts of interest between IAC and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us 
and our public stockholders."

includes us or any of our subsidiaries to the extent attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, as determined under the tax sharing agreement, and (ii) all 
taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined, unitary or separate tax retums of us or any of our subsidiaries. To the extent IAC failed to pay 
taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of IAC or one of its subsidiaries that includes us or any of our subsidiaries, the 
relevant taxing authority could seek to collect such taxes (including taxes for which IAC is responsible under the tax sharing agreement) from us or our 
subsidiaries. 
Under the tax sharing agreement, we generally will be responsible for any taxes and related amounts imposed on IAC or us that arise from the failure of a 
future spin-off of IAC's retained interest in us to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under 
Section 368(a)(1)(D) and/or Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. as amended, or the Code. to the extent that the failure to so qualify is 
attributable to (I) a breath of the relevant representations and covenants made by us in the tax sharing agreement or any representation letter provided in 
support of any tax opinion or ruling obtained by IAC with respect to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of such spin-off, or (ii) an acquisition of our equity 
securities. 
To preserve the tax-free treatment of any potential future spin-off by IAC of its interest in us, and in addition to our indemnity obligation descnbed above, the 
tax shanng agreement will restrict us, for the two-year period following any such spin-off, except in specific circumstances, from: (a) entenng into any 
transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of shares of our stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) issuing equity securities beyond 
certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing our shares other than in certain open-market transactions. (iv) ceasing to actively conduct our businesses or (v) taking or 
failing to take any other action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes, under Section 368(a)(1)(D) andior Section 355 of the Code. 
The indemnity obligations and other limitations could have an adverse effect on our business. financial condition and results of operations. For a more 
complete description of the tax sharing agreement, see "Certain relationships and related party transactions—Post offering relationship with IAC—Tax sharing 
agreement." 
Future sales or distributions of our shares by SAC could depress our common stock price. 
After this offering, and subject to the lock-up period described below, IAC will have the right to sell or distribute to its stockholders all or a portion of our 
Class B common stock that it holds. Although as of the date of this prospectus IAC has advised us that it does not have any present intention or plans to 
undertake such a sale or distribution, sales by IAC in the public market or distributions to its stockholders of substantial amounts of our stock in the form of 
common stock or Class B common stock, or the filing by IAC of a registration statement relating to a substantial amount of our stock, could depress the price 
of our common stock. 
In addition. IAC will have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of its shares or to include its 
shares in other registration statements that we may file. In the event IAC exercises its registration rights and sells all or a portion of its shares of our capital 
stock, the price of our common stock could decline. See "Shares eligible for future sale—Registration rights."
