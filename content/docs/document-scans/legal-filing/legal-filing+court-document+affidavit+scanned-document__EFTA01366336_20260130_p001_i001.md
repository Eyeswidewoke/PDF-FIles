Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited 
takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a 
staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series 
of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions 
that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. 
We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change 
of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage 
transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. 
If we effect our initial business combination with a company located outside the United States, or with 
operations located outside the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may 
negatively impact our operations. 
If we effect our initial business combination with a company located outside the United StatrN, or with 
operations or opportunities outside of the United States, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks 
associated with companies operating in an international setting. including any of the following: 
• costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations; 
• rules and regulations regarding currency redemption, 
• complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals; 
• laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected; 
• tariffs and trade barriers: 
• regulations related to customs and import/export matters; 
• longer payment cycles. 
• tax issues. such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States; 
• currency fluctuations and exchange controls; 
• rates of inflation; 
• challenges in collecting accounts receivable; 
• cultural and language differences: 
• employment regulations; 
• crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances. terrorist attacks and wars; and 
• deterioration of political relations with the United States. 
We may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so. our operations 
might suffer, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
