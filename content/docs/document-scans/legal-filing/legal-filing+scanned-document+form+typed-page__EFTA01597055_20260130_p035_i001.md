Liquidation of Collateral or Account 
We may satisfy any and all amounts you owe us in connection with any of your Accounts 
or agreements with us, or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including 
but not limited to any loans or promissory notes, from Property we hold or carry in any of 
your Accounts with us (other than qualified plan or IRA accounts or other accounts where 
doing so would be a prohibited transaction or violation of applicable law or regulation). 
Additionally, we may sell any or all Property held in any of your Accounts with us and 
cancel any open orders for the purchase or sale of any Property without notice in the event 
of your death or dissolution, or whenever in our discretion it is necessary for our 
protection. In these instances, we may also borrow or buy-in all Property held in any of 
your Accounts required to make delivery against any sale initiated for you. These sales or 
purchases may be public or private and may be made without advertising or notice to you 
and in the manner we determine in our sole discretion. You waive diligence, presentment, 
protest, demand for payment and notice of nonpayment and further waive all other 
notices and formalities to which you may be entitled under applicable law or otherwise, to 
the extent the waiver of such notices and other formalities is permissible under applicable 
law. Your waiver will not be invalidated by any demands, calls, tenders or notices that we 
may make. At any sale, we may purchase the Property or any portion thereof free of any 
right of redemption and you will remain liable for any deficiency in any of your Accounts, 
plus any accrued interest on the deficiency at our then customary rate, if applicable, or at 
the maximum rate allowable by law. We will not be liable to you in any way for any loses 
or adverse tax consequences resulting from a liquidation of your Property. 
USA Patriot Act 
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, 
Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information and 
documentation identifying each account holder. Therefore, when you open an Account, 
we ask for your name, address, date of birth and other identifying information about you. 
We may ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents. We may also 
screen your name against various databases to verify your identity. If we are unable to 
verify your identity, we may take any of the actions described under "Termination of your 
Account" in the General Terms and Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. 
Credit Report 
When you open an account with us, we may obtain your credit report or other credit 
references and verify or update the credit information you may have given to us previously. 
We may make verbal and written inquiries concerning your credit history. Likewise, we 
may request your credit report or other credit information and provide it to our Card 
Issuers and Check Provider or to our affiliates, as necessary or advisable to service and 
maintain your Accounts. We also use this information to offer you additional products that 
may be of interest to you.
