More detail 
Health officials have =eclared a public health emergency over a yellow fever outbreak. Over =70 cases have been 
confirmed, however around 1,500 suspected cases, and =t least 240 deaths, have been reported. More cases are 
expected, and =urther geographic expansion may occur, due to people moving between =tates, yellow fever infection in 
monkeys and low vaccination coverage. =he confirmed cases were identified in Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio =e 
Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Minas Gerais remains the state with the =ighest activity. The affected area in Rio de Janeiro state 
appears to be expanding with rural municipalities =Casimiro de Abreu) reporting cases for the first time. 
Bahia, Goias, Rio Grande do Norte and Tocantins have =uspected cases under investigation. Areas of Bahia, Goias and 
Tocantins =re known risk areas for yellow fever transmission, however to date Rio =rande do Norte has not been 
considered a state with risk of yellow =ever transmission. 
Health authorities have increased =istribution of yellow fever vaccine and implemented vector control =ctivities in 
response to the outbreak. 
What is Yellow =ever? 
Yellow fever is a viral disease that occurs in =arts of Africa and South America. It is transmitted by mosquitoes. =lthough 
some people infected with yellow fever only have a mild =llness, others develop a serious toxic form of the disease. The 
=ymptoms range from a mild influenza-like syndrome to a severe =emorrhagic fever with liver failure. There is no 
specific treatment for =he disease. Between 20%-50% of people who have a severe case of yellow =ever die from the 
disease. Because yellow fever can spread easily, many =ountries require proof of an up-to-date yellow fever vaccination 
before =hey allow travellers to enter the nation. Some require all travellers =o be vaccinated before entry, while others 
only require vaccination if =ou have recently travelled from an infected (or endemic) country. 
Yellow Fever Vaccination 
Vaccination is only available through designated yellow fever =accination clinics. They will issue a signed and stamped 
International =ertificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) which becomes valid 10 =ays after the vaccination, and is 
valid for the lifetime of the person =accinated. Booster doses are sometimes recommended after 10 years, and your 
doctor =ill make an individual recommendation based on your =ircumstances. 
Assessment 
Authorities are concerned =hat the outbreak will grow, given the favourable factors for ongoing =ransmission of yellow 
fever. The recommendations and requirements for =accination may change as more cases occur and new areas are 
affected. =n March 2017, the World Health Organization updated its risk assessment =or Espirito Santo and now 
recommends vaccination before travel to =nywhere in that state.
