2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
b. Objection of Jody Williams 
Class member ["30] Jody Williams filed an objection to the settlement agreement on 
March 10, 2016, arguing that the warranty extension provided by the settlement is too 
short and will not protect her 2007 MINI Cooper S hard top if it begins to "show signs of the 
timing chain problem in a year or two." ECF No. 77. Ms. Williams also states that she 
contacted her local MINI dealership to have her vehicle inspected, but that the dealership 
"won't even look at my vehicle unless it shows symptoms of the timing chain problem." Id. 
at 1. 
Plaintiffs do not deny that the warranty on Ms. Williams's vehicle, the very first model year 
in the Class, has already expired even under the extended terms of the settlement. ECF 
No. 92 at 22-23. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs, however, that the Courts job is "not to 
determine whether the settlement is the fairest possible resolution." Baby Products, 708 
F.3d at 173 (emphasis added). With regard to the amount of relief offered under the 
settlement and the Class members receiving that relief, "lines must be drawn somewhere." 
ECF No. 92 at 23 (quoting Alin v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 188223, 
2012 8751045, at *12 (D.N.J. Apr. 13, 2012) (finding that class settlement with auto 
manufacturer was reasonable where the "largest ["31] category of objections comes from 
customers whose cars were too old, or had too many miles to be eligible for recovery 
according to the lines drawn in the agreement)). 
Ms. Williams does not convince the Court that the seven-year warranty provided by the 
settlement, though perhaps not the fairest possible resolution, is unreasonable. The limited 
warranty extension reflects the reality that cars decline in value over time. See, e.g, In re 
Dispirit°, 371 B.R. 695, 701 n.6 (Bankr. D.N.J. 2007) ('Whether a vehicle is driven 30,000 
miles a year, or only on Sundays by an elderly parent to go back and forth to church, there 
can be no dispute that a vehicle's value is likely to decrease daily."). A warranty extension 
need not be indefinite to be reasonable. 
In any event, the settlement provides Ms. Williams with other forms of relief: as Plaintiffs 
point out, the settlement allows Class members to receive reimbursement for repairs and 
replacements on their timing chains and timing chain tensioners regardless of the age or 
mileage of the Class Vehicle, along with a graduated reimbursement for engine 
replacements. ECF No. 92 at 22. According to Plaintiffs, Ms. Williams and other Class 
members had notice of the alleged defects in their vehicles and were ["32] encouraged to 
seek free inspections and repairs long before the beginning of the claims period: 
Defendants instructed Class members to seek inspections of their vehicles in October 
2013, informing them that any necessary timing chain and tensioner repairs would be done 
"at no cost" to the Class members, and MINI mechanics were instructed to provide 
inspections and repairs of the timing chain and timing chain tensioner free of charge. Id. at 
22-23; see also Decl. Raymond P. Boucher in Support P. Mot. Attorneys' Fees, ECF No. 
86-6 Ex. 1 (sample letter informing Class member that "your vehicle may have been fitted 
with a faulty chain tensioner which may lead to an insufficiently tightened timing chain," 
instructing Class member to "contact your authorized MINI dealer at your earliest 
convenience to arrange an appointment," and informing Class member that "the repair will 
be done at no cost to you"). That Ms. Williams's dealership allegedly refused to inspect her
