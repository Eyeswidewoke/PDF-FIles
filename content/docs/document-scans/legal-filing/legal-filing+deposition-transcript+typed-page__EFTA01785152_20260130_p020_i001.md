Democracy does not require perfect equality, but it does requ=re that men and women from different social 
backgrounds and different walk= of life inhabit a common life, enough so that they realise that we are all in a common 
project. Just how much eq=ality is necessary for that is a qualitative judgment. 
To what extent do we have common spaces and public places tha= gather people together, that provide people access 
to the fundamental pre=equisites of a good life? My worry is that against the background of rising inequality over the 
last three decad=s, allowing markets to dominate more and more aspects of life is corruptin= that commonality. We find 
that people of affluence and people of modest m=ans increasingly lead separate lives. We live and work and shop and 
play in different places. Our childre= go to different schools. This isn't good for democracy and I don't th=nk, ultimately, 
that it's a satisfying way to live, even for those of us=who may inhabit the more privileged places of social life. 
Question: Bearing in mind the abuses t=at took place in the run-up to the credit crunch, at what point do imbalan=es in 
information between market participants lead to markets becoming una=ceptable? 
Sandel: Privilege of access and priv=lege of information did play a role in the run-up to the financial crisis.=One of the 
things that's striking in the aftermath of the financial cris=s is that despite the virtual meltdown of the global financial 
system, we have not really had a fundamental debat= about the proper role of money and markets in our societies. 
I think most of us expected that the financial crash would ma=k the end of an era of market triumphalism that goes back 
to the early 80s= An era defined by the faith that markets and market mechanisms are the primary instruments for 
achieving the public=good. And although we had some debates about regulation of the financial i=dustry, we didn't 
really go beyond that. The market faith has had a rema=kable staying power, even after the financial crisis, and I think 
it's interesting to try to figure out why,=and also an important question for our public life.</=> 
Question: Women do a lot of the unpaid=work in society. I've tried to come up with how we could change society =o 
that women are not taken advantage of. The market seems to be the only a=swer because it would put a value on their 
work. But I worry a lot about going down this road, because of the m=ral consequences and the limits of markets. How, 
other than a transaction =hat puts value and worth on something like childcare, can we address such =n issue? 
Sandel: It's a great question, and=not an easy one to answer because, as you say, much of what is traditional=y regarded 
as women's work is not commodified. In a market-driven societ= like ours, work that is not rewarded with money tends 
to be undervalued and unappreciated. And so there's the=temptation to think, just as you suggest, that commodifying 
what is tradit=onally regarded as women's work in the household is a liberating alterna=ive. 
And yet we see marketising and commodifying roles to do with =are, including care of children and care of the elderly. 
Those tend to be =obs that are poorly paid, and in fact are paid far out of proportion to what their moral importance 
suggests the= should be paid. So it could be that simply commodifying what is tradition=lly regarded as women's work 
would not solve the fundamental problem, wh=ch is that the roles of care are not sufficiently recognised, appreciated 
and rewarded in our society. 
The real question is: how can we change that? Whether women p=rform those roles or men perform those roles, we 
need a public debate abou= it, because simply commodifying care-giving roles may perpetuate and entrench the under-
appreciation of those roles if=they are not remunerated in a way that indicates their true importance. 
The appeal of the market faith isn't just that markets deli=er higher GDP or economic efficiency. The deeper appeal is 
that markets se=m to be value-neutral ways of deciding social questions. They seem to spare us democratic citizens the 
hard work =f reasoning together about contested values and judgments about the good l=fe, and questions of care and 
their importance go directly to the question=of the good life, and how we should value social roles. 
We should resist the temptation to think that we can outsourc= moral judgment and civic judgment to markets. And 
that means that we need=to grapple directly, not only as philosophers, but also in public life and in public discourse, 
with the hard questions, =nthony [Grayling), that you are putting to me: Is there a right way of val=ing this or that good?
