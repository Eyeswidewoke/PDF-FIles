This email is to put flesh on the bones of the voluminous material that I asked the office to 
send to you yesterday and you should receive it today. 
First, I would like for you to postulate the following: 
1. From 2004 to 2007, there was approximately $12 billion of resort loans made by 
U.S. financial institutions. 
2. Since real estate is private and local, it is difficult to have accurate, cumulative 
figures, but we estimate that $8 billion of these loans will end up in the hands of 
involuntary owners, i.e., the lenders. 
3. There is no class of security that makes a lender feel more insecure than 
repossessing a large resort community in development. While very few foreclosures 
have taken place to-date, on an average, they have sold for 10 cents on the dollar. 
4. Landmark has: 
• 
the best reputation in the business, 
• 
the management team that created the reputation, and 
• 
$153 million tax loss that expires 2022. 
Update of the Last 10 Years 
During the last 5 years of our fight with the government, because of Landmark's high quality 
environmental record, Landmark was invited by the European Union to develop the last 
great sand dune on the west coast of Ireland. We developed, on a fee basis, the Doonbeg 
Golf Club, which when it was opened, was rated by Golf Digest as the best new course in 
the world. Because of the time spent in Ireland, we were approached to do a development 
in the south of Spain, where we did Arcos Gardens, chosen by some as the best new course 
built that year in the world and chosen by most to be the best new course in Spain in many 
years. We also developed, on a fee and carried ownership interest basis, Lake Presidential in 
Maryland, 14 miles due east of the U.S. capital, and moved our corporate headquarters to 
Maryland. 
Although it was agreed that Landmark had contributed $131 million net value to the bank in 
1982, and that the government, without cause, violated their contract, Landmark received 
only $21 million from the Court of Claims. By the time it paid its lawyers, court costs, and 
its debt of honor to directors, etc., it had approximately $4 million net remaining. In 2004 
we purchased South Padre Island, our joint venture with the Lloyd Bentsen family in South 
Texas, from the fund run by Lewie Ranieri, and on a friendly basis, separated our 
relationship with Lewie. In 2006 we invested $4 million to purchase one-third of Apes Hill 
Club, Barbados. 
South Padre Island proved a success in that we sold approximately 150 houses in 2005, 200 
in 2006, 170 in 2007, and in each of these years had cash flow of $3 million to $5 million net 
to the parent. We have developed approximately half of the 2,000 acres, have 1,000 homes 
built, and approximately 1,200 left to be built. After Lloyd Bentsen's death, we bought from 
his estate, at a very attractive price, his interest, and it is now owned 100% by Landmark.
