tensions and promoting regional security and prosperity in the Middle East. As a major non-NATO ally of the

. Atlantic Council: Industry Minister Victor Bison6 on the Dominican Republic's economic  growth and 
resilience — Monday, January 29, 2024. Location: Atlantic Council, 3:00 PM. As the Dominican Republic 
prepares to host the IDB annual meeting and the sixth Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas 
(ECPA) Ministerial Meetings in March and the tenth Summit of the Americas in 2025, the year ahead 
presents a unique opportunity to spotlight strides in the country's economic development and leadership 
including its fast-growing and dynamic private sector. Minister Bison6 will address the steps taken to become 
a destination for nearshoring and to bring in new foreign investment. What are the Dominican Republic's 
plans for advancing its role as part of the broader drive toward greater supply chain resilience in the

. Atlantic Council: Adapting our defense capacities to a changing world: A discussion with Commissioner 
Thierry Breton — Monday, January 29, 2024. Location: Atlantic Council, 5:45 PM. The Atlantic Council's 
Europe Center is delighted to host a conversation with European Commissioner for the Internal Market 
Thierry Breton. This conversation will take place in-person on Monday, January 29 from 5:45 p.m. to 6:30 
p.m. ET. Since Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, the European Union and the United States have provided 
steadfast support for Ukraine, delivering unprecedented and world-leading levels of military, humanitarian, 
and financial aid. For transatlantic partners to continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, military 
support including artillery shells and defense systems will be instrumental as Ukraine's fight for survival 
continues. The EU has played an increasingly important role in Europe and Ukraine's security. To secure the 
future of its defense industry production and keep up the drumbeat of support for Ukraine, the EU is also 
drafting new proposals in support of Europe's defense industry and capabilities to build a stronger Europe 
and to bolster NATO and the transatlantic alliance. 
• Wilson Center: Bystander Society: Conformity and Complicity in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust — Monday, 
January 29, 2024. Location: Online Event, 4:00 PM. Drawing on personal accounts of experiences in the Third 
Reich and in wartime Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, Bystander Society explores the conditions for widespread 
passivity in face of violence against others. Fulbrook reconceives 'bystanding' in terms of changing 
interpersonal relations: indifference, ignorance (or choosing to ignore), and a sense of impotence, are 
historically produced. Many became increasingly complicit or involved in wartime perpetration; a few sought 
retreat or resistance; but remaining an 'innocent bystander' was largely a postwar myth. 
• The Hudson Institute: A Conversation with Rep. Darrell Issa on US—South Asia Relations — Monday, January 
29, 2024. Location: The Hudson Institute, 2:00 PM. The South Asian and Indian Ocean regions are critical for 
America's national security interests and will be key to countering China's military and economic rise through 
a United States—led Indo-Pacific coalition. As part of this coalition, the US has placed a strategic bet on India, 
demonstrated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's June 2023 state visit to Washington and President 
Joe Biden's September 2023 visit to New Delhi. Meanwhile, American policymakers have an interest in 
maintaining political and economic stability and monitoring extremism and terrorism across South Asia. This 
year will also be a crucial moment for countries in this region, as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka 
will all hold elections. For a conversation about US relations with South Asia and a look ahead at the 
challenges and opportunities in the coming year, Hudson Institute's Dr. Aparna Pande will host 
Representative Darrell Issa. They will discuss where relations stand between the United States and the 
countries of South Asia, especially in the context of American interests in the Indo-Pacific and the region's 
relevance to American strategy and policy
