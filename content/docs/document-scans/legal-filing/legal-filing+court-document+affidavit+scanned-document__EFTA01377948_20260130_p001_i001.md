be compelled to admit that such documents existed, admit that the documents were in his 
possession or control, and were authentic. In other words, the very act of production of 
25] the category of documents requested would implicitly communicate "statements of 
fact." Epstein's Resp. Brief, p.22. According to Epstein, the "act of production might not 
only provide evidence to support a conviction, but also a link in the chain of evidence for 
prosecution. Such compulsion to produce is the same as being compelled to testify." Id. 
The documents requested fall into several different categories consisting of agreements 
with the U.S. Attorney and State Attorney, and documents exchanged between the 
Defendant and the U.S. Attorney (Requests 1-4), telephone records (Requests 5-6), 
videos and photos of Epstein's Palm Beach residence (Request 7), documents relating to 
Plaintiff Jane Doe (Request 8), air travel records (Request 10), documents relating to 
model agencies (Request 11), correspondence with other witnesses (Request 14-17, 19), 
social networking documents (Request 18), gifts to minor females (Request 20), personal 
calendars and diaries (Requests 21-22), and, prescription medicines (Request 23).2 
2 On page 5. footnote 6 of Plaintiffs Reply Brief. Plaintiff concedes that the act of producing items in response to Request 9. 
concerning witness statements. and Requests 12-13. concerning photographs or images of females. may implicate the Fifth 
Amendment. As such. Epstein's assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege as it relates to these requests stands and Epstein 
need not produce documents responsive to Requests 9. 12-13.. 
Defendant's Motion as it relates to Production Requests 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 
20 is denied. The very act of producing documents in response to these requests [' 26] is 
testimonial in nature, in that by production, Epstein would be implicitly communicating 
"statements of fact," to which the Fifth Amendment privilege may be validly asserted. 
Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 35-36. Not only do the subject requests implicitly involve "statements 
of fact," given the nature of the allegations against Epstein, they could also serve as links 
in the chain of evidence needed for prosecution. As such, Epstein's Fifth Amendment 
privilege assertion as it relates to these requests is sustained. 
In sustaining Epstein's Fifth Amendment privilege, the Court has considered the particular 
requests at issue, the facts alleged in the Complaints, the elements needed to convict 
Epstein of a crime, and has drawn upon the Court's knowledge concerning the cases at 
issue. On this basis, the Court finds the privilege raised as to these requests valid, and 
asserted by Epstein only with reference to "genuinely threatening questions." Goodwin, 
625 F.2d at 701. Accordingly, finding the above-mentioned requests involve compelled 
statements that could furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict Epstein of a 
crime, the Court finds Epstein's Fifth Amendment privilege claim as applied to these 
requests validly asserted. 
The Court notes that in making this determination it is cognizant that 27] except in those 
instances where it is apparent from the face of the subject requests that the act of 
producing responsive items would be protected under the Fifth Amendment, it is the 
Defendant's burden to demonstrate that the act of producing any particular responsive 
documents would entail testimonial self-incrimination. U.S. v. Wujkowski, 929 F.2d 981, 
984 (4th Cir. 1991). In the instant case, it is evident from the requests themselves, the 
allegations in the various Complaints, and the facts and circumstances surrounding these 
cases, that to demand from Epstein a more particularized showing of danger, would
