PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 
1 he XL)600/1 is a monoblock 
amplifier utilizing IL Audio Nee high 
speed switching technology to deliver 
outstanding fidelity and efficiency. 
The XD600/1 can be operated with a wide 
variety of source units and system configurations. 
Its frequency response is limited to the range 
below 500 Hz. It is not designed for driving 
midrange speakers or tweeters. Every aspect of its 
operation has been optimized for low-frequency 
amplification. For detailed specifications, please 
refer to Appendix C (page 13). 
TYPICAL INSTALLATION SEQUENCE 
The following represents the sequence 
for a typical amplifier installation, using an 
aftermarket source unit or OEM Interface 
processor (like the CleanSweep CL441dsp). 
Additional steps and different procedures may 
be required in some applications. If you have 
any questions, please contact your authorized 
IL Audio dealer for assistance. 
I) Disconnect the negative battery post 
connection and secure the disconnected cable 
to prevent accidental re-connection during 
installation. This step is not optional. 
2) Run 4 AWG power wire from the battery 
location to the amplifier mounting location, 
taking care to route it in such a way that it 
will not be damaged and will not interfere 
with vehicle operation. Use 4 AWG or larger 
power wire and a power distribution block if 
additional amplifiers are being installed with 
the XD600/1. 
3) Connect power wire to the positive battery 
post. Fuse the wire with an appropriate fuse 
block (and connectors) within 18 inches (45 
cm) wire length of the positive battery post. 
This fuse is essential to protect the vehicle. 
Do not install the fuse until the power wire 
has been securely connected to the amplifier. 
4) Run signal cables and remote turn-on wire 
from the source unit to the final amplifier 
mounting location. 
5) Run speaker cables from the speaker systems 
to the amplifier mounting location. 
6) Find a good, solid metal grounding point 
close to the amplifier and connect the 
negative power wire to it using appropriate 
hardware (use of the IL Audio ECS master 
ground lug, XB-MGLU is recommended). 
Use 4 AWG wire, no longer than 36 inches 
(90 cm) from the amplifier to the ground 
connection point. In some vehicles, it may be 
necessary to upgrade the battery ground wire. 
(See page 5 for important notice). 
7) Securely mount the amplifier. 
8) Connect the positive and negative power 
wires to the amplifier. A fuse near 
the amplifier is not necessary if the 
XD600/1 is the only device being run 
from the fused main power wire. If 
the fused main power wire is shared 
by the XD600/1 and other amplifiers 
or devices, fuse each amplifier/device 
within 12 inches (30 cm) of wire length, 
via a fused distribution block or multiple 
individual fuse blocks/on-board fuses. 
9) Connect the remote turn-on wire 
to the amplifier. 
10) Connect the input cables to the amplifier. 
11) Connect the speaker cables to the amplifier. 
12) Carefully review the amplifier's control 
settings to make sure that they are set 
according to the needs of the system. 
13) Install the power wire fuse (50A for a 
single XD600/1) and reconnect the negative 
battery post terminal. Install the fuse (50A) 
near the amplifier (if applicable). 
14) Turn on the source unit at a low level 
to double-check that the amplifier is 
configured correctly. Resist the temptation 
to crank it up until you have verified the 
control settings. 
15) Make necessary adjustments to the input 
sensitivity controls to obtain the right 
overall output and the desired balance 
in the system. See Appendix A (page 12) 
for the recommended input sensitivity 
setting method. 
16) Enjoy the fruits of your labor with your 
favorite music.
