which the members of the ensemble interact in pairs, suffices. This simple interaction is that the beables of systems in the 
ensemble copy each other's states, with a probability that depends on the beables of the systems in the ensemble. 
Let us now proceed to make these ideas more concrete. This interpretation is based on several simple hypotheses: 
A. Basic hypotheses 
• Quantum mechanics applies to small subsystems of the universe which come in many copies. Thus, it applies to hydrogen 
atoms and ammonia molecules, but not to cats or people or the universe as a whole. Quantum mechanics is hence an 
approximation to an unknown cosmological theory. 
• For each microscopic system, there is an ensemble of systems in the universe with the same constituents, preparation and 
environment. A pure quantum state is a statistical description of one of these ensembles. The elements of the ensemble 
will be labeled .5/ where / = I ....,N. 
• Each individual microscopic system. Sr in the ensemble has two beables. The first is the value of some observables, which 
will be denoted b. The possible values of B are indexed by a = I,...P and are denoted tea. The second beable is a phase 
e4i. We then assert that the microscopic state of an individual system is the value of the pair of beables, (ahet ). 
• The beables evolve by a discrete and probabilistic Me. There is a probability in each unit time that each system sr copies 
the beables of system St. When this happens. 
al —1Oj, 
e4t —o est 
(I) 
The probability that this happen will be assumed to be a function of the beables of the two systems as well as the number 
of systems with the same values of A in the ensemble. It does not depend on where the members of the ensemble are in 
the universe. 
• The phases also evolve continuously according to a law that also depends on the distribution of beables in the ensemble. 
• We hypothesize that there is a process of phase alignment, by which the phases of two systems with the same values of 
evolve to become equal. The dynamics as first posited below conserves the alignment of phases. After that I present a 
model for the dynamic alignment of phases. 
• Finally, we hypothesize that these ensembles arc well mixed by the dynamics just described, so that the probability to 
make a measurement of the beable a on any member of the ensemble and get a particular value, ba, is given by the relative 
frequency with which that value appears in the ensemble. 
We will expand on the motivation for these hypotheses shortly, and then show how they may be expressed in a form that is 
equivalent to quantum mechanics. But what we have said is sufficient to answer the questions with which we opened. 
I. Microscopic systems have indefinite values of beables. while macroscopic systems have definite values, because micro-
scopic systems come in many copies, and so are subject to the copy rule, in which they evolve stochastically by copying 
the beables of members of the ensemble they share. Macroscopic systems are those that have no copies, anywhere in the 
universe, hence they are nor subject to the copy dynamics. 
2. The probabilities in quantum physics refer to ordinary relative frequencies in an ensemble of real. existing systems. 
3. The members of the ensemble are to be found spread throughout the universe. 
B. More about beables and Interactions amongst members of an ensemble 
Before we go on to develop the hypotheses just stated it would be good to revisit some aspects of the motivation. We begin 
with the similarities and differences to other theories of beables. 
This proposal shares with hidden variables theories such as deBroglie-Bohm,Vink and Nelson the idea that there am real 
beables. It shares with Nelson also the idea that pure quantum states correspond to ensembles of individual systems. However, 
it differs from all of these interpretations in asserting the ensemble be physically real, as well as in several other respects. 
First, it eliminates the need to pick the configuration space as a beable. In what follows there is assumed to be a beable 
observable, A but its choice is inessential. That this is possible was shown by VinkI3), by giving a deBroglie-Bohm like 
formulation for a general choice of beables. Indeed, some of the formal development that follows was inspired by Vink's 
paper13]. Whether there is a preferred choice for it is a subject for future work.
