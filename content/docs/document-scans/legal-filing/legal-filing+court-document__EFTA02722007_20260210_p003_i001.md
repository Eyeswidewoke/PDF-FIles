In fact, what has best defined the Iranian foreign policy, at least since the end of the 1980s, is 
the word maslehat, which in Farsi (Persian) means expediency. Pragmatism makes 
everything possible in Iranian diplomacy, as long as it is convenient for the regime and suited 
to the Iranian national interest, from the point of view of prominent specialists of the Islamic 
Republic.? And this word is what defines most accurately the Iranian relationship with 
Afghanistan, as this paper will show. Contrary to what some think, the Iranian regime is not 
eager to commit collective suicide by pursuing an imprudent foreign policy towards its 
neighbour. It is highly realistic, and focuses first on the interests of the Iranian nation. Does it 
mean that Iran could be a force for stability for its neighbour? In order to give a credible 
answer to such a question, one needs to focus on two aspects: first, on what the Afghan 
problems prior to 9/11 meant (and often still mean) for Iran, and how the latter reacted when 
it got a real chance to help fix its 'failed' neighbour; second, on Iranian foreign policy 
towards Afghanistan today, through the knowledge one can have, thanks to open/verified 
sources (above all), as much as possible.*
What a Chaotic Afghanistan Meant for Iran before the 2001 :American Campaign: 
(1): Drugs and Refugees 
The best way to understand what instability in Afghanistan means for Iran is to think about 
the pre-9/11 period, more precisely the 1990s. At that point in time, Afghanistan became 
more important than it used to be for Iranian diplomacy. It was a consequence of the Iran-Iraq 
war: the eastern part of Iran developed itself economically and demographically, as it was 
away from the frontlines. The northeast became strategically important, upgrading at the 
same time Iran's interest in post-Soviet Central Asia and Afghanistan.9 But immediately after 
the Iran-Iraq war, Afghanistan became a source of constant problems for Iran. Its troubled 
neighbour has begun to be a source of many issues for the Iranians — from social, political 
and economic points of view from the 1990s. And most of those pre-9/11 problems are pretty 
much alive, with a sense of urgency that makes Iran a proponent of authentic stability in 
Afghanistan. 
First, Afghanistan, immediately after the end of the Cold War (forgotten by the US and the 
rest of the world), became an important source of drugs. It has had dramatic consequences for 
Iran to this day. At the end of 2009, around one million Iranians were addicts. And the

Unfortunately, nowadays, scholarship associated with Iranian foreign policy is often based on guesswork and 
leaked sources that cannot be verified. In this paper priority is given to open sources and sources that can be 
verified or that have been proven by multiple other sources.
