A Russian doll is recursive: open it and you find a smaller-scale copy inside. The Russian doll describes one of the 
most important gestures in Gothic (indeed, in medieval) architecture: an archway with a smaller archway nestled 
inside, and a smaller one within that. 
The nest can be two dozen layers deep. The "recursive archway" occurs in a strikingly pure and beautiful form at 
Exeter Cathedral, where it dates from the late 1200s. But it is ubiquitous in Gothic; the great portals of the high 
Gothic triad of Chartres, Reims, and Amiens, set with extraordinary sculpture, are "recursive archways." So are 
countless other doorways and arcade elements. Simpler recursive archways occur in the Romanesque and Norman 
architecture that preceded Gothic. 
Recursive tracery windows and archways are the basis of observations by Jean Bony and Erwin Panofsky. Like 
other medievalists, they are unfamiliar with the idea of recursion; are therefore forced back onto inadequate 
substitutes. But recursion helps sort their observations out. 
Jean Bony comments on the clerestory windows at Saint-Denis. They are formally the same as the ones at Amiens 
which I have already described; but at Saint-Denis, the clerestory absorbs the triforium just below it. Instead of the 
dark windowless band of Chartres, this triforium has windows, and its rhythm (four beats to the measure) is created 
by the same vertical shafts that partition the clerestory windows. 
In the triforium, moreover, each beat is split in two—yielding an eight light composition and three levels of recursion. 
Bony describes Saint-Denis as "composed of a series of similar forms progressively subdivided in increasing 
numbers and decreasing sizes." 
Erwin Panofsky describes the same phenomenon as 'this principle of progressive divisibility (or, to look at it the 
other way, multiplicability)"--a principle that "increasingly affected the entire edifice down to the smallest detail." This 
observation is far-reaching and important, but notice that "division" (Panofskys word) suggests breaking into 
identical parts but doesn't apply to the nesting of one form within a larger version of itself. Panofsky's "principle of 
progressive divisiblity" is a fuzzy and roundabout way of saying "recursive structure." 
Recursion allows us to connect Panofsky's observation with the west wall at Reims, the recursive trefoils of 
Strasbourg, and many other designs. It allows us to extend his observation to the nesting of small structures within 
larger ones. It allows us to connect it with Louis Grodecki's description of the Sainte Chapelle, where the shrine that 
once held sacred relics "was fashioned in the form of a tiny church' This shrine was intended for display on a 
canopied platform, itself shaped like a church, and the canopied platform stands at the front of the Chapelle, a 
full-sized church. Thus a church within a church within a church. 
This is a common principle of Gothic art," Grodecki adds. Summerson cites a passage by Wilhelm Worringer (1927) 
that comes closer than any other to giving an accurate paraphrase of the idea of recursion and its importance: 
Gothic man seeks to lose himself not only in the infinity of the great. but also in the infinity of the small. . . . Every 
individual detail is, in itself, a world of bewildering activity and infinity, a world which repeats in miniature, but with 
the same means, the expression of the whole. . . . The crown of a pinnacle is a cathedral in miniature, and anyone 
who has sunk himself in the ingenious chaos of a tracery can here experience on a small scale the same thrill in 
logical formalism as he experiences in the building system as a whole. 
Gothic buildings are alive as the sea is with waves, wavelets, little wavelets, littler wavelets. If you look inside Wells 
Cathedral, the greatest triumph of English Gothic and (perhaps) of Gothic altogether, you find large vaults 
underpinning the ceilings, small vaults under the stone canopy of the bishop's 
throne, smaller vaults under the canopies in the choir. Stone creatures scamper through carved foliage on the 
capitals of the nave piers, a magnificent branching canopy springs from the trunk-like central pillar of the chapter 
house, an intricate starburst (one star within a second within a third) clings to the ceiling of the sublime Lady 
Chapel—and a flock of statues roost in niches within the famously cliff-like front facade. In a chantry chapel in the 
nave the ceiling is carved with delicate outward-rippling fan vaults--and on the outside of this small enclosure, the 
carved stone cornice dissolves upwards into a lacy border, which dissipates gracefully into thin air.
