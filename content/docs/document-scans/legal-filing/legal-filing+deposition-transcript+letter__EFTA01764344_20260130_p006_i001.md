We got the point. Y=u recreated part of Lincoln's train journey to Washington, were sworn in o= his Bible, and all but 
reenacted his post-inaugural lunch -- right down t= the sour cherry chutney served on Mary Todd Lincoln's china. 
With all due respec=, Mr. President, try to be a tad more humble and less narcissistic in your=second term. I knew Abe 
Lincoln, and you're no Abe Lincoln. I know you already think <http://www.politico.cominews/stories/1211/70841.html> 
you're entitled to be in the presidential hal= of fame, but forget transforming the country at home. Americans don't 
wan= a polarizing transformer; they want a president who can fix what's broken -- this time with the support of 
Rep=blicans so that change can be legitimate, authoritative, and successful. 
Abroad, you also th=ught you would transform the world. You seemed to believe that, somehow, y=ur own persona and 
the imperfections of your predecessor could combine to =olve historic conflicts and convert adversaries into friends. But 
the world wasn't and isn't going to be trans=ormed by you or anyone else. Look around at the 192 other nations 
represented in the United Nations. Do you see any transformative figures there, or =nternational conflicts just waiting 
to be solved? 
If the world is ame=able to anything these days, it's transaction. Sports analogies are usuall= horrible, but in this case I 
think one works: Forget home runs; try small=ball. Moderate progress, after all, can buy time to deal with the bigger 
issues like Iran and the Israeli-Pale=tinian conflict (more on that later). 
2. Legacy cuts b=th ways: the hero or the goat 
Having been elected=to a second term, the only thing you're running against now is the reputat=ons and 
accomplishments of your predecessors. Health care -- it's too soon=to know for sure -- may be your domestic legacy. But 
the temptation to secure a foreign-policy spectacular will be =reat, too. 
I saw the draw of l=gacy play out in a negative way during the final year of the Clinton admin=stration. As Clinton saw his 
last days in the White House tick away, he gr=sped on to the idea of hosting an ill-timed, ill-prepared, and poorly 
thought-through summit with Israeli Prime Ministe= Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat at Camp David in July 
2000=The rush to the summit led to a collapse of the peace process from which I=raeli-Palestinian negotiations have yet 
to recover. Arafat received much of the blame for Camp David's fa=lure, much of it well-deserved but counter-
productive nonetheless, leading=to another spasm of violence. 
As the sand passes =hrough the hourglass of your second term, that's something to keep in mind= Yes, a dramatic 
success on a tough issue can add to the luster of your pr=sidency. But failure also carries consequences that go well 
beyond your presidency and can have serious implications for =our successor. 
3. Empower your =ecretary of state 
I would have though=, given the huge domestic crisis you faced in 2008, that you would have be=n only too happy to 
delegate significant responsibility to your diplomat-i=-chief. And why not? Hillary Clinton is talented and knowledgeable. 
And while certainly not a great secretary o= state in the mold of Henry Kissinger or James Baker, she has done an 
imme=se amount to improve America's image by pursuing an agenda of global human=sm -- emphasizing the role of 
women, the environment, technology, and social media. 
But when it came to=the big issues such as Iran, Afghanistan, Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian=conflict, you withheld far 
more than you gave. All power on these issues f=owed to and from the White House. Clinton owned not a one of them. 
No matter whom you =hoose as your next secretary of state, you ought to be more generous in de=egating authority 
over some of these big issues.
