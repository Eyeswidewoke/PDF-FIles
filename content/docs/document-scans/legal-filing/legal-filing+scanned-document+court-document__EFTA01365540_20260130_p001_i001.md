RISK FACTORS 
An investment in the Securities involves certain risks. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following 
factors, in addition to the matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, prior to investing in the 
Securities. 
Risk Factors Relating to the Securities 
Investor Suitability. An investment in the Securities will not be appropriate for all investors. Structured investment 
products, like the Securities. are complex instruments, and typically involve a high degree of risk and arc intended 
for sale only to sophisticated investors who arc capable of understanding and assuming the risks involved. Any 
investor interested in purchasing Securities should conduct its own investigation and analysis of the product and 
consult its own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. 
Nature of the Obligations. The Issuer Only Notes will be limited recourse debt obligations of the Issuer, and the 
Senior Notes will be limited recourse debt obligations of the Co-Issuers. in each case, payable solely from the 
Collateral pursuant to the indenture. The Preferred Shares are equity of the Issuer. The Securities do not represent 
interests in or obligations of, and are not guaranteed, insured or secured by any rating agency. any Transaction Party 
(other than the Issuer or, in the case of the Senior Notes, the Co-Issuers), any Affiliate, director, member or partner 
of the Co-Issuers, or any other Transaction Party, or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer, or in the case 
of the Senior Notes, the Co-Issuers). if distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the 
Securities, no other assets will be available for payment of the deficiency and, following liquidation of the 
Collateral, the obligations of the Issuer, or in the case of the Senior Notes. the Co-Issuers, to pay am such deficiency 
will be extinguished. 
Liquidity Considerations. There is currently no secondary market for the Securities, and none may develop. The 
Securities are not expected to be readily marketable. In addition, the Securities are subject to certain transfer 
restrictions (including minimum denominations) that may further limit their liquidity. Furthermore, various 
regulatory requirements may restrict a potential investor's ability to purchase Securities or make such an investment 
unattractive to them. See "— Tax Considerations" and "— Risk Factors Relating to Regulatory and other Legal 
Considerations — Recent Legal and Regulatory Developments." The Securities arc designed for long-term 
investors and should not be considered a vehicle for short-term trading purposes. As a result, investors must be 
prepared to bear the risk of holding the Securities until their Stated Maturity. To the extent that any secondary 
market exists for the Securities in the future, the price (if any) at which Securities may be sold could be at a 
discount, which in some cases may be substantial, from the principal amount of the Securities. To the extent any 
market exists for the Securities in the future. significant delays could occur in the actual sale of Securities. 
Subordination. Payments on the Securities are subordinated to payments on each Higher Ranking Class (including 
in the case of the Subordinated Securities, subordinated to any required payments on the Rated Notes) and certain 
fees and expenses. Payments on the Preferred Shares are also subordinated to any payments in respect of the claims 
of any other creditors of the Issuer, secured or unsecured. If any Coverage Test is not satisfied as of any 
Determination Date or if a Continuing Effective Date Ratings Confirmation Failure has occurred and is continuing. 
cash flows otherwise payable to Lower Ranking Classes of Securities will be diverted to the payment of principal on 
Higher Ranking Classes of Rated Notes as set forth in the Priority of Payments. Interest Proceeds will be diverted. 
in accordance with the Priority of Payments, to purchase additional Collateral Obligations. during the Reinvestment 
Period (a) if an Effective Date Ratings Confirmation Failure has occuntd, to the extent necessary to obtain Rating 
Agency Confirmation: (b) if the Supplemental Diversion Test is not satisfied as of the rotated Determination Date, to 
the extent necessary to satisfy such test as of the Determination Date: and (c) to the extent of Designated Proceeds. 
If an Event of Default has occurred and has not been cured or waived and acceleration has occurred. Interest 
Proceeds and Principal Proceeds will be applied to pay both principal of and interest on each Higher Ranking Class 
until each such Class is paid in full before any further payment or distribution will be made on any Lower Ranking 
Class. See "The Indenture and the Fiscal Agency Agreement— Payments after an Acceleration of Maturity.- As a 
result. Lower Ranking Classes will not receive interest payments until each Higher Ranking Class has been paid 
principal and interest, Lower Ranking Classes may not receive partial or full payment of principal and further 
distributions may not be made in respect of the Subordinated Securities.
