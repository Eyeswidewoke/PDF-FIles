standby letters of credit in the amount of approximately $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively. issued by TD Bank. These letters of credit are 
being maintained as security for performance of certain of the Company's operating lease obligations. The letters of credit are automatically

Receivables 
Trade receivables consist of uncollateralized, non-interest bearing customer obligations due under normal trade terms. Other receivables consist 
primarily of reimbursable amounts due from co-manufacturers for packaging of $7.2 million and $4.4 million and income tax receivables of $7.9 
million and $18.2 million at December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses 
resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments and other actual and estimated deductions. If the financial condition of our 
customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, an additional allowance could be required. Past due 
balances are reviewed individually for collectability. As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, the allowance for doubtful accounts was immaterial.

2013 and December 31, 2014. respectively, were from our two large customers. In 2013 and 2014, two customers accounted for 10% or more of 
our consolidated net sales. Sales to these customers represented 58% and 20% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. 53% and 22% of 
net sales for the year ended December 31. 2013. and 49% and 24% of net salts for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
Inventories 
Inventories, consisting principally of finished goods available for resale and packaging materials, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. We 
provide reserves for estimated obsolescence based on specific identification. If assumptions about future demand change or actual market 
conditions are less favorable than those projected by management. we may require additional reserves. 
Property, Plant, and Equipment 
Property. plant. and equipment are stated at cog, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: computer equipment over• 3 years, computer software over 5 years, 
furniture and fixtures over 5 years, machinery and equipment from 5 to 15 years. and buildings. building improvements and land improvements 
over 40 years. Computer software consists primarily of third-party software acquired and developed for internal use and is accounted for in 
accordance with accounting guidance on internal use software. Leasehold improvements and fixed assets purchased under capital leases are 
amortized over the lesser of the asset life or related lease term. When fixed assets are sold or otherwise disposed of. the accounts are relieved of the 
original cost of the assets and the related accumulated depreciation, and any resulting profit or loss is credited or charged to operations.
