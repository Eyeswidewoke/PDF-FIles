2012-02-22 -- GAZA CITY — In the wake of revolutionary change in the Middle East, the forces of political Islam have 
scored one electoral victory after another. As the West grapples with the rapid rise of moderate Islamists in Tunisia, 
Morocco, and Egypt, the issue of Hamas's role in the Palestinian territories looms large. The signing of a new unity deal 
between Hamas and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's secular Fatah party earlier this month has heightened an 
unprecedented struggle within Hamas over its future course as an Islamist movement. How the West responds could 
very well influence the outcome. 
As events in recent weeks have proven, Hamas's days of near-total isolation in the Middle East are over. While most 
Western governments continue to consider it a terrorist organization, in Arab capitals, political embargos have given 
way to engagement. In December, Ismail Haniyeh, Prime Minister of the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority in Gaza, 
embarked on a tour of the Mediterranean that included stops in Tunis, Cairo, and Istanbul. In mid-February, he was 
warmly received in Qatar, Bahrain, and Iran. 
This political outreach, however, has not emanated solely from Gaza. In January, Khaled Mashal, the leader of Hamas's 
Damascus-based political bureau, embarked on a diplomatic initiative of his own, and was hosted by King Abdullah of 
Jordan — the first such visit in more than a decade. In February, Mashal crowned these efforts in Qatar with the signing 
of the new unity agreement with Fatah, which commits both Palestinian movements to a transitional government under 
Abbas's leadership. 
Ever since, disagreements within Hamas have been escalating, pitting the movement's Diaspora leadership against the 
Hamas-led Gaza administration, which has openly rejected the unity deal. While personal ambitions certainly play a role 
in the tensions, what lies at the core is a fundamental conflict over Hamas's character. 
Haniyeh, who represents the conservative wing of Gaza's Hamas leadership, has sought to cash in on regional changes. 
His long-boycotted government was thrown a lifeline by regime change in Egypt and the opening of the border with 
Gaza. Notably, Haniyeh's recent diplomatic tour garnered not only symbolic recognition for Hamas, but also support for 
his uncompromising stance vis-à-vis Israel. He missed no opportunity to criticize "futile" peace negotiations, and, in 
Tehran, he pledged that Hamas's "resistance" would continue "until all Palestinian land has been liberated." 
What that means needs little clarification. In a further telling move, Haniyeh also recently suggested merging Hamas 
with the Islamic Jihad movement, which continues to target Israeli civilians with rockets fired from Gaza. 
Mashal, by contrast, has come to represent a force of change. Last May, he signed an initial reconciliation agreement 
with Fatah in Cairo, which committed Hamas to a Palestinian unity government, called for a cessation of violence, and 
accepted the notion of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders. Mashal also offered Abbas a one-year mandate for 
negotiations with Israel, and, unlike Haniyeh, supported recent Israeli-Palestinian "exploratory talks" in Jordan. 
One reason for Mashal's change of heart can be found in the ongoing popular revolt in Syria against President Bashar al-
Assad. The leader of the Sunni Hamas can no longer support his Syrian host, who has cracked down on the Sunni-
dominated opposition. Thus, Mashal has attempted to close ranks with Fatah, and is seeking to move Hamas's Diaspora 
headquarters from Damascus — a powerful symbol of his efforts at re-invention. 
But Mashal's refusal to support Assad has not only forced him to re-locate. It has also unleashed the wrath of Syria's ally, 
Iran, which has responded by scaling down its financial support for Hamas — thus denying Mashal a key source of 
influence within the movement. Indeed, Mashal's decision has effectively ended his ties to his two most important allies, 
thereby not only weakening his position, but also increasing his readiness to embrace political moderation.
