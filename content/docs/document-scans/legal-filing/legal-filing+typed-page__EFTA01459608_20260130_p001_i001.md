FX Blueprint: Forever Young 
Theme #10: Yen up and be koreageous Buy JPY/KRW, USD/KRW 
For years, the market has been wary of pushing for 
KRW weakness, given Korea's sizeable balance of 
payments surplus. However, the era of sizeable 
surpluses is over We expect the recycling of the current 
account surplus via domestic capital outflows to pick up 
pace this year, driving USD/KRW higher The thinning 
out of the BoP surplus will in general make the won 
more susceptible to the global risk environment The 
change in flow dynamics also has ramifications for the 
domestic rates market The increasing supply of duration 
°striated with the prospect of portfolio outflows should 
translate into a steepening bias given already inverted 
yield differentials between the long-end KTB and UST 
curves. 
For years, the large current account (CA) surplus Korea 
possesses helped partly insulate the won from the 
strong USD environment. Although the currency 
started to depreciate more notably in 2015, KRW 
performance has been in line with that of the region. 
However, the tide is turning, and we believe the won 
can depreciate more forcefully, for two main reasons. 
First, DB Economics expects the CA surplus to shrink 
to around $97bn in 2016 from $121bn in 2015, driven 
by two factors; 1) slowdown in import compression; 
and 2) the ongoing slowdown in exports. Note that 
over the past few years, the widening of the current 
account surplus has been driven mostly by falls in 
commodity prices - most notably oil prices (peak to 
trough, oil prices have declined by 45%). 
Second, 
the 
recently-announced 
measures 
to 
encourage outflows will also likely play a key role in 
further recycling the CA surplus, tilting the balance of 
payments towards a deficit, or neutral at a minimum. 
These channels can be categorized broadly as; 1) 
promoting overseas portfolio investment; 2) a change 
in the overseas investment mandate for National 
Pension Service (NPS); and 3) encouraging overseas 
mergers and acquisitions. In our view, the measures 
could be more effective this time around compared 
with 2007. Back then, and despite the sizeable portfolio 
outflows by domestic investors, the high FX hedge 
ratios had countered the impact on FX of domestic 
outbound investment. This time around, however, the 
government has e<plicitly stated that IX gains on 
equity investment are to be exempted from tax. On the 
bond side, over the past few quarters we have seen a 
strong pick-up in overseas bond investments by lifers 
in search of higher returns (see chart), which in our 
view will persist. Simaru to equity, 
hedoirto on these 
flows is likely to gradually reduce. As of the start of 
2016, NPS is now allowed to reduce its FX hedge ratio 
on overseas bond investment by half in 2017 and to nil 
in 2018. This profound change will also likely be 
followed by domestic lifers.
