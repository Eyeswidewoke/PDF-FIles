March 30, 2012 -- Israel's intelligence services have scaled =ack covert operations inside Iran, ratcheting down by 
"dozens of percent=94 in recent months secret efforts to disable or delay the enemy state's nuclear program, senior 
Israeli security offi=ials tell TIME. The reduction runs across a wide spectrum of operations, c=tting back not only alleged 
high-profile missions such as assassinations a=d detonations at Iranian missile bases, but also efforts to gather firsthand 
on-the-ground intelligence and=recruit spies inside the Iranian program, according to the officials. 
The new hesitancy has caused "increasing dissatisfaction" i=side Mossad, Israel's overseas spy agency, says one official. 
Another se=ior security officer attributes the reluctance to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who the official 
describes as worrie= about the consequences of a covert operation being discovered or going aw=y. Netanyahu was 
Prime Minister in 1997 when a Mossad attempt to assassina=e senior Hamas official Khaled Meshaal in Amman Jordan 
ended in fiasco. Two Mossad operatives were captur=d after applying a poison to Meshaal's skin, and returned to Israel 
only=after Netanyahu ordered the release of the antidote. The Prime Minister al=o was forced to release Hamas' 
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin from an Israeli prison, dramatically boosting th= fortunes of the religious militant 
movement. 
"Bibi is traumatized from the Meshaal incident," the offici=1 says. "He is afraid of another failure, that something will 
blow up in=his face." 
Iranian intelligence already has cracked one cell trained and e=uipped by Mossad, Western intelligence officials earlier 
confirmed to TIME <http://www.time=com/time/world/article/0,8599,2104372,00.html> . The detailed =onfession on 
Iranian state television last year by Majid Jamali Fashid for=the January 2010 assassination by motorcycle bomb of 
nuclear scientist Mas=oud Ali Mohmmadi was genuine, those officials said, blaming a third country for exposing the cell. 
In that case, the public damage to Israel was circumscribed by =he limits of Iran's credibility: Officials in Tehran routinely 
blame set=acks of all stripes on the "Zionists" and "global arrogance," their labels for Israel and the United States. 
But=that could change if the Islamic Republic produced a captured Israeli nati=nal or other direct evidence — something 
on the lines of the closed circ=it video footage and false passports that recorded the presence of Mossad agents in the 
Dubai hotel where Hamas=arms runner Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was found dead in his room in January 2010.=Difficult-
to-deny evidence of Israeli involvement trickled out for weeks; =etanyahu was Prime Minister then as well. 
The stakes are higher now. With the Iranian issue at the forefr=nt of the international agenda, a similar embarrassment 
could undo the imp=essive global front Washington has assembled against the mullahs — perhaps by allowing Iran to 
cast itself as victim,=or simply by recasting the nuclear issue itself, from one of overarching g=obal concern into a 
contest confined to a pair of longtime enemies.=/p> 
Some warn that the assassinations already run that risk. After =he most recent killing, of nuclear scientist Mostafa 
Ahmadi-Roshan in Janu=ry, the United States "categorically" denied involvement in the death and issued a 
condemnation. Western intelli=ence officials say he was at least the third Iranian scientist killed by M=ssad operatives, 
who lately are running short of new targets, according to=lsraeli officials. 
"It undercuts the consensus, th= international consensus on sanctions," says Mark Fitzpatrick, a former =tate 
Department nuclear proliferation specialist who opposes the assassinations. 
The covert campaign also invites retribution from Iran's own =ar-reaching underground. In the space of just days last 
month, alleged Ira=ian plots against Israeli targets in Thailand, Azerbaijan, Singapore and Georgia were announced as 
thwarted, and Indian o=ficials blamed Iran for a nearly fatal attack that went forward in New Del=i. The wife of an Israeli 
diplomat was injured by a magnetic bomb attached=to her car by a passing motorcyclist, the precise method Israeli 
agents are alleged to have used repeatedly on t=e crowded streets of Tehran. 
But scaling back covert operations against Iran also carries co=ts, especially as Iran hurries to disperse its centrifuges, 
some into faci=ities deep underground. Quoting an intelligence finding, one Israeli official says Iran itself estimates that 
sabotage to =ate has set back its centrifuge program by two full years. The computer vi=us known as Stuxnet — a joint
