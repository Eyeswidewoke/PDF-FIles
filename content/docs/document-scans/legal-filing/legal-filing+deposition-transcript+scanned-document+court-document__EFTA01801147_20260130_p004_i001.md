serve the =eeds of multiple procedures. RDNT seeks to develop leading =ositions in regional markets in order to leverage 
operational =fficiencies. RDNT's scale and density within selected geographies =rovides close, long-term relationships 
with key payors, radiology =roups and referring physicians. Each of RDNT's center-level and =egional operations teams is 
responsible for managing relationships with =ocal physicians and payors, meeting its standards of patient service =nd 
maintaining profitability. BONI provides training programs, =tandardized policies and procedures and sharing of best 
practices among =he physicians in its regional networks. In addition to its imaging =ervices, one of RDNT's subsidiaries, 
eRAD, Inc., develops and sells =omputerized systems for the imaging industry, including Picture =rchiving 
Communications Systems ("PACS") and Radiology Information =ystems ("RIS"). Another one of its subsidiaries, Imaging 
On Call =LC, provides teleradiology services for remote interpretation of images =n behalf of radiology groups, hospitals 
and imaging center customers. =eleradiology is the process of taking radiological patient images, such =s X-rays, CTs, and 
MRIs, from one location to another for the purposes =f interpretation and/or consultation. Teleradiology allows 
radiologists =o provide services without actually having to be at the location of the =atient and allows trained specialists 
to be available 24/7. In addition =o providing alternative revenue sources for RDNT, the capabilities of =oth eRAD and 
Imaging On Call can make the RadNet imaging center =perations more efficient and cost effective. 
RDNT 
performed 4,525,490, 4,142,267, and 3,740,443 diagnostic =maging procedures and generated net revenue of 
$703.0 million, $647.2 =illion, and $585.1 million, respectively.* Seasonality - RDNT =ypically experience some 
seasonality to its business. During the first =uarter of each year RDNT generally experiences the lowest volumes of 
=rocedures and the lowest level of revenue for any quarter during the =ear. This is primarily the result of two factors. 
First, RDNT's volumes =nd revenue are typically impacted by winter weather conditions in its =ortheastern operations. It 
is common for snowstorms and other inclement =eather to result in patient appointment cancellations and, in some 
=ases, imaging center closures. Second, in recent years, RDNT has =bserved greater participation in high deductible 
health plans by =atients. As these high deductibles reset in January for most of =hese patients, RDNT has observed that 
patients utilize medical services =ess during the first quarter, when securing medical care will =esult in significant out-of-
pocket expenditures.* Industry - RDNT estimates =hat the national imaging market in the United States is $100 billion 
=nnually, with projected mid-single digit growth for MRI, CT and PET/CT =ver the next several years, driven by the aging 
of the U.S. population, =ider physician and payor acceptance for imaging technologies, and =reater consumer and 
physician awareness of diagnostic screening =apabilities. While X-ray remains the most commonly performed =iagnostic 
imaging procedure, the fastest growing and higher margin =rocedures are MRI, CT and PET. The rapid growth in PET 
scans is =ttributable to the increasing recognition of the efficacy of PET scans =n the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. 
The number of MRI and CT =cans performed annually in the United States continues to grow due to =heir 
wideracceptance by physicians and payors, an increasing number of =pplications for their use and a general increase in 
demand due to the =ging population. 
* Payors - The fees charged for =iagnostic imaging services performed at RDNT's facilities are paid by a =iverse 
mix of payors; Commercial Insurance (Blue Cross/Blue Shield =tans) 59%, Managed Care Capitated Payors 9% & 
Medicare& =edicaid 25%

federal net operating loss =arryforwards acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of Raven =oldings 
U.S., Inc. were subject to limitations related to their =tilization under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Future 
=wnership changes as determined under Section 382 of the Internal =evenue Code could further limit the utilization of 
net operating loss =arryforwards. Cumulative excess tax benefits of $4.9 million, related =o the exercise of nonqualified 
stock options, will be recorded in =quity when realized.
