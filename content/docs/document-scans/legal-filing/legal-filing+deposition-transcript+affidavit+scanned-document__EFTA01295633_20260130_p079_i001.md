785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea;

717 F.3d at 487-88. The majority would nevertheless "sweep many individual plaintiffs and 
sets of facts into one class on the premise that all reflect illegal conduct by the defendant 
in practice and culture if not in policy" -- even though that is "precisely the sort of class that 
the Supreme Court recently rejected in [Wal-Mart]." Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Schs., 
668 F.3d 481, 504 (7th Cir. ["955] 2012) (Rovner, J., concurring in part). Furthermore, 
simply saying that a company has a "cultural problem" does not identify any particular 
("1521 employment policy or practice, McClain v. Lufkin Indus., Inc., 519 F.3d 264, 274 
(5th Cir. 2008), let alone a common, uniform policy spanning the class. 
We have also never held that facts establishing a hostile work environment unavoidably 
relate to all other employment decisions made in the same company. Such a connection 
would be hard to justify, as acts giving rise to a hostile work environment are only distantly 
related to the discrete acts that underlie disparate treatment and impact claims. "The 
probative value of other discriminatory acts depends 
. on the nature of the discrimination 
charged." Hunter v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., Engine Div., 797 F.2d 1417, 1424 (7th Cir. 
1986), abrogated on other grounds by Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 
109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1989). And "[h]ostile environment claims are different 
in kind from discrete acts." Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 115, 122 
S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). In contrast to acts creating a hostile work 
environment, discriminatory employment decisions "inflict[] direct economic harm." 
Burlington Indus., 524 U.S. at 762. They will often require "the imprimatur of the enterprise 
and the use of its internal processes." Id. 
The "probativeness" of items like comments, jokes, and other acts "is [also] circumscribed 
if they were made [or done] in a situation temporally remote from the date of the 
employment decision[s], or if they were not related to the employment decision[s] in 
question or were made by nondecisionmakers." McMillan v. Mass. Soc'y for Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals, 140 F.3d 288, 301 (1st Cir. 1998). Here, Plaintiffs' evidence suffers to 
("153] some degree from all three of these defects. For instance, Plaintiffs' statements 
often do not tell us when the offensive conduct occurred, so we have no way of assessing 
temporal proximity. None of the "cultural" evidence pertains specifically to promotions. And 
most all of the relevant hostile-work-environment conduct came from non-decisionmakers, 
even though it "is the perception of the decisionmaker that is relevant" in claims like 
Plaintiffs'. Smith v. Flax, 618 F.2d 1062, 1067 (4th Cir. 1980); accord Mateu-Anderegg v. 
Sch. Dist. of Whitefish Bay, 304 F.3d 618, 623 (7th Cir. 2002) ("[S]tatements are only 
relevant if they come from a decisionmaker, someone involved in the adverse employment 
decision[s]."). Lastly, to the limited extent that supervisors did involve themselves in the 
incidents that Plaintiffs described, those supervisors chiefly worked in the beam mill —
undermining any inference of a common, plant-wide policy. 
At bottom, the majority concludes that we should permit Plaintiffs to pursue two class 
claims pertaining to promotions because they have successfully established their right to 
pursue a separate, distinguishable hostile-work-environment claim. Title VII does not work 
that way, and, rhetoric aside, the majority is unable to identify a single decision to support 
that kind of proposition. "In the law, the absence ("154] of precedent is no 
recommendation." Dukes v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 509 F.3d 1168, 1200 (9th Cir. 2007) (Kleinfeld, 
J., dissenting). Moreover, to assume that a plaintiff establishes a right to class treatment 
for his discrete-act class merely because he has established such a right as to a hostile-
