9. 
Protection of Lender's Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security 
Instrument. If (a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this 
Security Instrument, (b) there is a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender's interest in 
the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, 
probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this 
Security Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, 
then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in 
the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the 
value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing the Property. Lender's actions can include, but 
are not limited to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority over this Security 
Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable attorneys' fees to protect its interest in 
the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured position in a 
bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property 
to make repairs, change locks, replace or board up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, 
eliminate building or other code violations or dangerous conditions, and have utilities turned on or 
off. Although Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not 
under any duty or obligation to do so. It is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any 
or all actions authorized under this Section 9. 
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower 
secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date 
of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower 
requesting payment. 
If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold. Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the 
lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge 
unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing. 
10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan, 
Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If, for any 
reason, the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the 
mortgage insurer that previously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make 
separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay 
the premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance 
previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage 
Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer selected by Lender. If 
substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available. Borrower shall continue to 
pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the insurance 
coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a 
non-refundable loss reserve, if permitted under Applicable Law, in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such 
loss reserve shall be non-refundable, notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, 
and Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss reserve, if 
permitted under Applicable Law. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage 
Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer
