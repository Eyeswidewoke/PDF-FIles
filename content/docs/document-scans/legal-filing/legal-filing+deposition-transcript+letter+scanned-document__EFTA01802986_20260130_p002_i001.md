The accumulati=n of old, stagnant cells in the body is to blame for some age-related dise=ses, a new study has found. 
When researchers removed such cells from mice,=they were able to delay the onset of cataracts and slow age-related 
muscle=loss. 
"This i= really a technical tour de force," says geneticist Norman Sharpless =f the University of North Carolina School of 
Medicine in Chapel Hill, who =as not involved in the study. "And then they went beyond this technic=l feat and made 
findings that are really important to understanding the basic science of aging." 
Most cells in the b=dy can't continue dividing forever. After a cell has duplicated itself a n=mber of times—around SO is 
the average—a genetic switch turns =ff the division program. A cell that's no longer dividing is known as sene=cent; it 
continues to live but no longer functions as it once did. While m=st senescent cells continue to behave as whatever cell 
type they started a=, they also begin to secrete immune proteins that scientists hypothesize c=uld cause age-related 
changes in the surrounding tissues. In elderly human=, at least VA of the total cells in the body are thought to be 
senescent. =he cells accumulate in places particularly affected by aging—the eye= and muscles, for example. 
"It has been hypothe=ized, since these cells are found at sites of age-related pathologies, tha= they are related to the 
development of these pathologies," says biol=gist Jan van Deursen of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, lead 
auth=r of the new paper. But the connection hasn't been fully fleshed out, he s=ys. 
Van Deursen and colleagues developed a way to kil= senescent cells in mice, clearing them from the body. They 
engineered mic= so that when cells flipped on a gene called p161nk4a, a=marker for senescence, the cell would also turn 
on the production of inact=ve cellular death genes, not normally produced by senescent cells. Then, w=en the 
researchers gave the mice a drug, the death pathway would be activa=ed in all senescent cells. "Our met=od allowed us 
to look at the consequences of removing senescent cells at d=fferent stages of the mouse life cycle," van Deursen says. 
"We d=dn't just block senescence altogether." 
F=rst, the researchers cleared senescent cells from the mice throughout thei= lives—giving the drug every 3 days 
beginning as soon as the animals=were weaned. Although the mice did not have an increased life span, the on=et of 
cataracts was delayed by about 100 days, the treated mice had twice =s wide muscle fibers, and their spine curvature 
and fat deposits resembled=those of youthful mice. Next, the researchers gave the drug to older mice =hat already 
showed signs of aging, such as muscle loss. After S months, th= treated mice showed better improvement in treadmill 
tests than untreated =ice. Their muscle and fat cells did not show s=gns of aging 
<http://www.nature.com/nature/journalkaop/ncurrent/full/na=ure10600.html> , although the treatment didn't 
reverse aging that had alr=ady happened, the team reports online today in Nature.</=> 
"I think the results are quite striking," Sharpless says= But he cautions that further research is needed to understand the 
effects=of removing senescent cells. Although they may promote some age-related di=orders, they could prevent 
others. "Whether there are any unintended =esults of this has to be studied further," he says. "Yes, we mig=t make 
cataracts better, but will it come with the risk of cancer or infec=ions?" 
Since the work relied on genetically engineered mice, it's not directly translatable into humans, van Deursen says. =span 
style='background:yellow'>Researchers, however, can now screen drug= to find compounds that might activate cell 
death in senescent cells, he s=ys, or that might turn the immune system against senescent cells. <=:p>
