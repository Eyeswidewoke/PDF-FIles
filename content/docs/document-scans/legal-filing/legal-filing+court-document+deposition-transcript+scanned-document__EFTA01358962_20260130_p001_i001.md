874 F.3d 787, *; 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 20596, "; 
Bankr. L. Rep. (CCH) P83,176; 64 Bankr. Ct. Dec. 216 
The Subordinated Notes holders argue that the Fourth Proviso carves out the Second-Lien 
Notes from the Baseline Definition, i.e., that the Second-Lien Notes are an "[i]ndebtedness 
or obligation of the Company . . . that by its terms is subordinate or junior in any respect to 
any other Indebtedness of the Company." The Subordinated Notes holders rely heavily on 
the "in r13] any respect" language. They argue that the Second-Lien Notes are 
subordinate to, for example, the First-Lien Notes--because, pursuant to the Intercreditor 
Agreement, the liens supporting the Second-Lien Notes are junior to the liens supporting 
the First-Lien Notes—and that they are therefore subordinate to other Indebtedness of the 
company. 
The lower courts rejected this argument, and concluded that the Second-Lien Notes 
unambiguously constitute Senior Indebtedness despite the Fourth Proviso. They did so in 
reliance on a distinction between "lien subordination" and "payment (or debt) 
subordination," concluding that the Fourth Proviso unambiguously carves out from the 
Baseline Definition only the latter and not the former.° Because the Second-Lien Notes are 
not subordinate in payment to other note classes--but rather, the liens supporting their 
notes are subordinate—the lower courts concluded that the Second-Lien Notes are not 
covered by the Fourth Proviso. 
5 The district court discussed in some detail the distinction between lien subordination and paymert/debt subordination. 531 
B.R. at 328. In short. ll)en subordination involves two senior creditors with security interests in the same collateral, one of 
which has lien priority over the other. . . . By contrast, in payment subordination, the senior lender enjoys the right to be paid 
first from all assets of the borrower or any applicable guarantor, whether or not constituting collateral security for the senior or 
subordinated lenders." Id. 
We do not agree with the lower courts that the Fourth Proviso unambiguously incorporates 
a distinction between lien subordination and payment subordination. Rather, we conclude 
that the Fourth Proviso renders the definition of Senior ("14] Indebtedness ambiguous as 
to whether it includes the Second-Lien Notes. Nevertheless, we conclude that this 
ambiguity should be resolved in Debtors' favor given the plethora of evidence in the record 
that the parties intended the Second-Lien Notes to be Senior Indebtedness.

As discussed, the lower courts concluded that the Second-Lien Notes are unambiguously 
Senior Indebtedness. [HN2] Under New York law, which governs the Indenture, a 
fundamental objective of contract interpretation is to give effect to the expressed intention 
of the parties. The initial inquiry is whether the contractual language, without reference to 
sources outside the text of the contract, is ambiguous. Contract language is ambiguous if it 
is capable of more than one meaning. 
We are not persuaded by the Debtors' (and lower courts') conclusion that the Fourth 
Proviso's reference to "subordinate . . . in any respect" unambiguously refers only to 
payment subordination and not to lien subordination. The Debtors read the Fourth Proviso 
as if it states "subordinate . . . in right of payment," which of course it does not. In so doing, 
the Debtors disregard the breadth of the term "in any respect," a term which is generally 
thought ("15] r796) to be as broadly encompassing as possible.° And, as a practical 
matter, it seems to us illogical to believe that a second-lien holder does not possess an
