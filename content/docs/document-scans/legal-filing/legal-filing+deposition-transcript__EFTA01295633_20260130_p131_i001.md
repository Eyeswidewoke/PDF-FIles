2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
delivered by Mr. Steadman, such that BoA would be estopped from asserting the statute of 
frauds as a defense. See Klinke, 616 P.2d at 647. 
Specifically, for the same reasons as discussed in the previous section regarding 
acceptance, a jury could reasonably find that Mr. Ngo's representations to Mr. Steadman 
constitute an express or implied promise on behalf of BoA make a written memorandum of 
the loan modification. See supra § III.C.1; (Steadman Dep. at 105:1-106:20; 2d Steadman 
Dep. 22:13-27:17; 28:7-29:8 (stating that he expected Mr. Ngo to sign the loan 
modification agreement when he delivered it to him, and thought that he did sign it); 
Steadman Decl. at 2 ("It was my understanding that Mr. Ngo signed the final modification 
paperwork after he accepted it from me.").) The subsequent p31] continued assurances 
by BoA representatives to Mr. Steadman that BoA was in the process of finalizing his loan 
approval also support such a finding.° (See Steadman Dep. at 113:13-117:11; Steadman 
Decl. at 2-3).) Moreover, a jury could reasonably find that Mr. Steadman detrimentally 
relied on BoA's promise to sign the contract in that he continued making modified 
payments to BoA and Green Tree for over a year, and also apparently installed a new roof 
and painted his house. (See Steadman Decl. at 3; Steadman Dep. at 116:11-16; Ford Ex. 
4 at 192 (3/27/14 email from Mr. Steadman).) Because there is a genuine issue of material 
fact as to whether BoA—and by extension, Green Tree--can assert the statute of frauds 
defense, summary judgment on Mr. Steadman's breach of contract claim is inappropriate. 
See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. 
9 These out-of-court statements are admissible in this context because they are not offered to show the truth of the matter 
asserted (namely, that Mr. Steadman's modification had been approved). Rather, they are offered to show (1) that the 
statements occurred and (2) the effect the statements had on the listener, specifically. that Mr. Steadman could have 
detrimentally relied cc the statements. r32] regardless of their truth. As such, they are admissible. See H. Koch 6 Sons. 578 
F.2d at 1290-91: L.A. News Sew v. CBS Broad, Inc.. 305 F.3d 924. 935 (9th Cir.) opinion emended end superseded. 313 F.3d 
1093 (9th Cir. 2002) ("Out-of -court declarations introduced to show the effect on the listener are not hearsay.") Accordingly, the 
court DENIES Green Tree's motion to strike Mr. Steadman's account of those statements (see Reply at 2). For the same 
reasons. Mr. Ngo's alleged statements to Mr. Steadman concerning the finalization of the contract are admissible.
D. Duty of Good Faith 
"A duty of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every contract." Badgett v. Sec. State 
Bank, 116 Wn.2d 563, 807 P.2d 356, 360 (Wash. 1991); see also Rekhter v. State, Dep't 
of Soc. & Health Servs., 180 Wn.2d 102. 323 P.3d 1036. 1041 (Wash. 2014). This duty 
obligates the parties to cooperate with each other so that each may obtain the full benefit 
of performance. Badgett, 807 P.2d at 360. As discussed previously, Green Tree's 
assertion that Mr. Steadman's claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith must fail 
because there is no "direct" contractual relationship between Green Tree and Mr. 
Steadman is incorrect. See supra § III.B; (Reply at 7.) The contractual rights and 
obligations to collect payments from Mr. Steadman and to service the loan have been 
assigned to Green Tree. (See Assignment.) As Mr. Steadman points out, Green Tree has 
an implied duty to exercise those rights and perform those obligations fairly ['33] and in 
good faith. See Rekhter, 323 P.3d at 1041. Therefore, the court denies Green Tree's 
motion for summary judgment on Mr. Steadman's claim for breach of the duty of good 
faith.
