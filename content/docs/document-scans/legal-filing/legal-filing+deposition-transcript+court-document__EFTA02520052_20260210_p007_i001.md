point. I do =etain a CFI email address in part as a courtesy to me and in part because =t serves a business purpose (for 
example, I still receive occasional email= addressed to the president of the organization). 
Turning to the substance of your a=legations, first you should be aware that I 
take the issue of sexual haras=ment very seriously. This is confirmed by the fact that after I was hired =y CFI as its in-
house lawyer (a position I held prior to becoming presiden= and CEO) I insisted that the organization adopt a 
comprehensive zero-tole=ance harassment policy covering workplace harassment. Moreover, during the=time I was 
president and CEO we had three separate state trainings for the=entire staff on sexual harassment issues. In addition, 
where necessary, we=did not hesitate to expend significant resources, including retaining outs=de investigators, to 
conduct serious, detailed inquiries into harassment c=aims. One such inquiry cost the organization over $40,000. 
Therefore, any =uggestion that I do not personally take harassment claims seriously is amp=y disconfirmed by my 
record. 
Regarding the alleged incident on the 2011 cruise, the =irst I became aware of it 
was when Pat Beauchamp, CFI's business m=nager and the employee responsible for cruise logistics, wrote to me in 
20=3 indicating she objected to inviting Lawrence Krauss on our upcoming Gala=agos cruise. I found this strange, and I 
responded to her almost immediate=y asking the reasons for her objection. She gave two reasons. The first wa= that 
Krauss did not pay sufficient attention to the guests on the 2011 cr=ise. I had heard this concern from one guest myself; 
on the other hand, I =Iso heard from several guests that they thought Krauss's presentat=ons were excellent and a 
highlight of the cruise. Accordingly, I did not g=ve this concern much weight. 
The second reason was that Krauss h=d allegedly asked a female guest on the 
cruise to join him and his partner= apparently for some sort of sexual activity (I cannot recall whether Krau=s was 
engaged or married or just seriously involved with his female compan=on at the time, although they were clearly 
romantically involved and seeme= very much in love). This is the first I had heard of this proposition. No=complaint by 
the guest or anyone else had been made to me at the time of t=e cruise, although I was on the cruise and clearly visible 
throughout the =ruise. 
I =sked Ms. Beauchamp for contact information for this guest. I did call the 
=uest and she substantially confirmed what Ms. Beauchamp had said. I apolog=zed on behalf of the organization. The 
guest indicated although she was ta=en aback by Krauss's proposition at the time, she did not want to =ursue the matter 
further. I then got in contact with Krauss. Krauss denied=the allegation. In light of the guest's reluctance to pursue the 
m=tter and Krauss's own denial and, importantly, because between the=time of the 2011 cruise and the Galapagos 
cruise we had instituted a polic= regarding harassment at any CF= event, which covers not just employees, but speakers 
and attendees, I dec=ded to go ahead with my plan and have Krauss as a speaker on the Galapagos=cruise. Krauss was 
fully aware of our harassment policy regarding CFI even=s because we had had a discussion about it. Therefore, I 
expected him to c=mply with that policy on the Galapagos cruise. As far as I know he did, be=ause we received no 
complaints about his conduct. Nor have we received any=complaints about his conduct at other events. 
Let me just take a moment to highlight=the 2012 policy, which you can find in 
full here, 
http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/cfis_new_policy_on_hostile_conductharassment_at=conferences/ 
<http://=ww.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/cfisnew_policy_onhostileconducthar=ssmentatconferencesh 
along wi=h the announcement I made explaining the rationale for the policy. This po=icy was, certainly at its time, 
arguably the strongest any nonprofit organ=zation had regarding conduct at its events. Again, this policy shows that =ny 
suggestion that CFI, as an organization, or that I personally took a la= attitude regarding harassment is completely 
without factual foundation.q=ont> 
In your ema=l you mentioned that one staffer resigned after I invited Krauss on 
the Ga=apagos cruise. I'm not aware of any staffer resigning because of t=at. If you give me a name I could comment on 
the reasons for the staffer l=aving. Ms. Beauchamp remained an employee of CFI (and went on the Galapago= cruise 
with Krauss).
