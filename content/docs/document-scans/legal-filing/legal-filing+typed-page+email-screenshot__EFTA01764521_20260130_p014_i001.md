We begin to see this=pattern today with regard to many emerging powers, but especially of cours=, China's posture 
toward the United States.31 As was predicted and expecte= in the post-Cold War context of growing regional power 
centers, the legitimacy of a system dominated by the United=States is coming under increasing challenge. More states 
(and, increasingl=, non-state actors) want to share in setting rules and norms and dictating=outcomes. 
The obvious and inev=table result has been to reduce the effectiveness of U.S. diplomacy. While=measuring the relative 
success of a major power's diplomacy over time is a=chancy business (and while Washington continues to have success 
on many fronts), the current trajectory is produ=ing a global system much less subject to the power of U.S. diplomacy 
and o=her forms of influence. Harvard's Stephen Walt catalogues the enormous str=ngths of the U.S. position during and 
after the Cold War, and compares that to recent evidence of the emergi=g limits of U.S. power. Such evidence includes 
Turkey's unwillingness to s=pport U.S. deployments in Iraq, the failure to impose U.S. will or order i= Iraq or Afghanistan, 
failures of nonproliferation in North Korea and Iran, the Arab Spring's challenges =o long-standing U.S. client rulers, and 
more.32 As emerging powers become =ore focused on their own interests and goals, their domestic dynamics 
will=become ever more self-directed and less subject to manipulation from Washington, a trend evident in a num=er of 
major recent elections.33 
Washington will stil= enjoy substantial influence, and many states will welcome (openly or grud=ingly) a U.S. leadership 
role. But without revising the U.S. posture, the =ap between U.S. ambitions and capabilities will only grow. Continually 
trying to do too much will create more risk ri=k of demands unmet, requests unfulfilled, and a growing sense of the 
absur=ity of the U.S. posture. Such a course risks crisis and conflict. Similarl=, doubt in the threats and promises 
underpinning an unviable U.S. security posture risks conflict: U.S. offici=ls will press into situations assuming that their 
diplomacy will be capabl= of achieving certain outcomes and will make demands and lay out ultimatum= on that basis 
only to find that their influence cannot achieve the desired goals, and they must escalate t= harsher measures. The 
alternative is to shift to a lesser role with more =imited ambitions and more sustainable legitimacy. 
A military force com=s under increased stress and risks military setbacks. A state trying to do=more than it can afford, as 
a treasury or a society, risks overextending i=s military, with possibly ruinous results. We are already beginning to see 
the evidence: U.S. ground forces are showi=g symptoms of stress and exhaustion in terms of post-traumatic stress 
leve=s, reenlistment challenges at key officer grades, tragic suicide numbers, =nd other indices.34 After ten years of 
continuous deployments, equipment has become worn down, and there are g=owing reports of everything from ships 
being unready for missions because =f wear and tear to aircraft engines exploding to cruisers with hull cracks=to radar 
technology failing inspections.35 As of the first quarter of 2011, just over 40 percent of Navy and marine a=rcraft were 
judged "mission capable," according to the services well off=the 60 percent goal, itself seemingly modest.36 The vice 
chief of staff of=the U.S. Air Force, for example, testified in July 2011 that "this high operations tempo (OPTEMPO) has 
had=some detrimental effects on our overall readiness. Since 2003, we have see= a slow but steady decline in reported 
unit readiness indicators."37 The ='stress on the force is real and it is relentless," said Chief of Naval Operations Admiral 
Jon Greenert.38=/span> 
The existing paradig=, then, threatens to destabilize the U.S. military, both in terms of perso=nel and equipment. 
Defenders of the existing paradigm have a simple cure: =ore resources. Ramp up procurement budgets, expand the 
Army and Corps, boost readiness funding, and solve the=problem. As argued above, however, the financial ceiling 
descending on U.S= security capacities is not fungible, it is structural. There is no way to=avoid further substantial cuts 
without worsening cuts to domestic programs that will already be excruciat=ng. Americans would have to absorb a 
lower standard of living in order to =ontinue to underwrite global primacy. If they will not, then persisting in=the current 
posture will gradually erode the health and readiness of U.S. military forces. 
The ultimate result =f this dangerous practice will be military setbacks in the field. Overexte=ded U.S. forces unable to 
bring their full complement of equipment to the =ight will be unable to prioritize. Meantime, adversaries employing the 
asymmetric techniques discussed above =the proliferating means of anti-access and area denial, as well as space a=d 
cyber counterstrike capabilities) will impose costs which will horrify a=U.S. public accustomed to "virtual wars." In sum, 
remaining locked in the current paradigm invites future em=arrassments, setbacks, and even defeats.
