February 6, 2013 --=Why did it take so long to secure a date for talks between Iran and the P5=#43;1? 
After all, in the w=eks before the presidential election in November, it was reported that the=United States and Iran had 
already tactically agreed to convene private, o=e-on-one talks. And since then the United States, the European powers, 
Russia, and China, all sought to arran=e another round of negotiations, first in December and then in January. It=now 
appears that Iran, which is about to enter its presidential election s=ason, has finally agreed to what will be the first 
round of negotiations with the P5+1 since the last r=und in Moscow seven months ago. On Tuesday, Tehran announced 
chttp://old.irna.ir/News/Politic/Next-round-of-lran-G5-1-t=lks-to-be-held-late-February/80530492> 
The negotiations wi=l be a serious test for the Obama administration and for John Kerry, the n=w secretary of state. 
Previous rounds have all faltered because neither si=e was willing to make concessions to the other, and so far there is 
little sign that the United States and the =5+1 have improved their offer to Iran very much. As the talks were ann=unced, 
the Washington Post reported <http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/ira=-agrees-to-new-nuclear-
talks-with-us-other-world-powers/2013/02/05/d1587d2=-6fa4-11e2-aa58-243de81040ba_story.html> : "The P5+1 
powe=s have made only mild revisions to a proposal that Iran flatly rejected la=t June." Until now, the United States has 
been unwilling to acknowledge =ran's right to enrich uranium on its own soil and to suggest that some economic 
sanctions might be lifted as part o= a deal, and Iran has refused to agree even to a limited deal called "st=p, ship, and 
shut" — involving the suspension of its enrichment to 20 =ercent purity, shipping its existing stockpiles of 20% uranium to 
a third country for processing, and shutting =own its underground facility at Fordo, near Qom — without an agreement t= 
lift sanctions. 
After the reelectio= of Barack Obama in November, there were great hopes that the president wo=ld have greater 
political freedom of offer concessions to Iran. Yet, publ i=ly at least, the White House isn't signaling that it is ready to 
make a more generous offer to Iran, and in f=ct Obama in January signed into law yet another round of draconian 
economi= sanctions. 
Perhaps as a result= Iran allegedly dragged its feet on setting a date for talks. Despite prod=ing from the P5+1 — 
including urgent efforts by Russia <http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/17/us-nuclear-iran=russia-
idUSBRE90G0P420130117> =— i= January Iran reportedly went silent about talks 
chttp://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/pro=pects-for-nuclear-talks-with-iran-
dim/2013/01/16/7f1113f4-5f42-11e2-a389-e=565c81c565_story.html> . Russia, increasingly frustrated by the inability 
of Tehr=n and the West to negotiate seriously, vented its frustration. "Some of =ur partners in the six powers and the 
Iranian side cannot come to an agreement about where to meet," Russia= Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news 
con=erence <http://www.ynetnews.com/artides/0,7340,L-4337898,00.html= target=> . "We are ready to =eet at any 
location as soon as possible. We believe the essence of our talks is far more important (than the site), an= we hope that 
common sense will prevail and we will stop behaving like lit=le children." 
According to analys=s in Washington, reinforced by comments from Iran itself, a big reason for=Tehran's recalcitrance is 
that Iran wants to prove to the United States =hat its vaunted sanctions regime will not force Iran to make unilateral 
concessions at the bargaining table. In =ddition, Iran is concerned that it won't get much in return in talks wit= the West, 
and that it will be asked to make unilateral concessions on ura=ium enrichment without getting sanctions relief in 
return. Combined with Iranian =nternal divisions <http://www.nytimes.com/2=13/02/05/world/middleeast/high-level-
feud-bares-tensions-in-iran.html?ref=3Dtodayspaper> , as its own presidential election season gets un=erway 
<http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/201401/iran-p51-nuclear-negotiations-presidential-election.html> , that 
could mean that for the next six months or so Ayatollah Ali Khamenei =imply won't be ready to talk seriously, despite 
scheduling the Kazakhsta= round.
