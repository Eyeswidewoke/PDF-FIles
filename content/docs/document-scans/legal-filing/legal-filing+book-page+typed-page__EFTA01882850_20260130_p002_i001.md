Alternatives to custodial sentencing 
The Criminal Justice Act, the Courts Act and the Anti-
Social Behaviour Act were all passed in 2003. They 
were designed to rebalance the criminal justice system in 
favour of the victim and the community. As discussed 
below, the new system embraces a number of 
approaches including restorative justice, community 
sentencing, and electronic monitoring. 
Restorative justice 
Restorative justice aims to promote accountability 
through reconciliation and reconnection to the 
community. In practice it usually involves direct (face-to-
face) or indirect (through a mediator) communication 
between victims and offenders, but can also involve 
financial restitution ordered by a court. A review' of 
restorative justice in the UK and abroad showed that it: 
• Substantially reduced repeat offending for some, but 
not all, offences. In particular, restorative justice 
seemed to work best in reducing re-conviction rates for 
more serious crimes involving personal victims such as 
violence and, to a lesser extent, property crime. 
• Reduced re-conviction rates for some, but not all, 
offenders. In particular, restorative justice was more 
effective than prison in reducing re-conviction rates 
among adult offenders, and gave similar re-conviction 
rates as prison for young offenders. 
• Delivered benefits to the victims where the process 
involved face-to-face conferences. Benefits included 
reduced post-traumatic stress symptoms in the short-
term, and possibly also longer-term health benefits. 
• Delivered cost benefits when used as an alternative to 
conventional criminal justice, and in terms of reduced 
costs of healthcare for victims. 
The Home Office funded three restorative justice schemes 
from 2001 through its Crime Reduction Programme. 
These included the Connect scheme in Inner London, the 
Justice Research Consortium which operated at three 
sites (London, Thames Valley and Northumbria) and the 
Remedi scheme in South Yorkshire. These offered a 
range of direct and indirect mediation to offenders and 
victims. An evaluation of the schemes reported higher 
levels of satisfaction following direct mediation than with 
indirect mediation.5 However, the report noted that 
indirect mediation allowed those not wishing a direct 
meeting with the other party to access restorative justice. 
Community sentencing 
As part of the reform of sentences brought about by the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003, the generic community 
sentence was introduced in 2005. It is used as one of 
the four orders detailed in Box 1 and is designed to allow 
the sentence to be tailored to the offender/offence 
through one or more of the following 12 requirements: 
• compulsory (unpaid) work on community projects; 
• participation in specified activities, such as education 
or training; 
• participation in Offending Behaviour Programmes; 
• prohibition from certain activities; 
• electronic curfew; 
Box 1 Community orders 
The requirements in the generic community sentence can 
be applied to offenders age 16 and over in four main ways: 
• Community Rehabilitation Order (CR0) — between 6 
months and 3 years in length - may include 
requirements such as residence, probation centre 
attendance or treatment for drug, alcohol or mental 
health problems. 
• Community Punishment Order (CPO) — unpaid work in 
the community of between 40 and 240 hours. 
• Community Punishment and Rehabilitation Order 
(CPRO) — a combination of the above, with between 1 
and 3 years probation combined with between 40 and 
100 hours community punishment. Like a CRO, it may 
have additional requirements. 
• Drug Treatment and Testing Order (DUO) - requires the 
regular testing of drug offenders and compulsory 
attendance at a specified drug treatment centre for 6 
months to 3 years. 
Under Me Community Payback scheme, local residents are 
able to make suggestions and nominate work that they 
would like to see offenders carry out in their area. 
• exclusion from certain areas (usually monitored 
electronically); 
• residence requirement (such as an approved hostel); 
• mental health treatment; 
• drug treatment and testing; 
• alcohol treatment; 
• supervision (by an offender manager from the 
Probation Service); 
• attendance at a centre offering structured activities. 
In May 2007, the Ministry of Justice's Penal Policy paper 
outlined the Government's intention to develop higher 
intensity community orders as an alternative to short 
term custody (under 12 months). This approach is being 
developed initially in Derbyshire for implementation in 
March 2008. In January 2008, the Ministry of Justice 
announced an additional £13.9 million over the next 
three years for such projects (see Box 2 for details). 
Box 2 Pilot on high intensity community orders 
The intensive community sentences pilot began in 
Derbyshire in March 2008. The format of these orders 
includes a combination of unpaid work, electronic 
monitoring, behaviour programmes, mentoting, and help 
with resettlement, all under intensive supervision. Overall, 
the projects funded will test two new approaches: 
• Intensive Control Sentences: these might include 
supervision, programme and activity requirements, plus 
other requirements as necessary, such as peer 
mentoring, judicial monitoring, engagement with the 
police and resettlement work. 
• Intensive Punitive Sentences: made up of unpaid work 
and curfew adapted to provide a short, intensive, 
community punishment as an alternative to very short 
term custody (6 months and under). This could include 
a supervision requirement and involve a set number of 
hours of physically demanding unpaid work combined 
with supervision appointments and curfew restrictions to 
last for 3.6 months.
