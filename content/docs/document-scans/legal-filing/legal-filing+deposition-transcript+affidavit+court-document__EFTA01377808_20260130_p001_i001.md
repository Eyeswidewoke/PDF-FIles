S- /A 
The initial conversion price for the convertible preferred stock is $0.21627 for the Series A preferred stock, $0.71977 for the 
Series B-1 preferred stock, $0.95369 for the Series B-2 preferred stock, $5.79817 for the Series C preferred stock, $11.014 for the 
Series D preferred stock, and $15.46345 for the Series E preferred stock. In the event the Company issues shares of additional 
stock, subject to customary exceptions, after the preferred stock original issue date without consideration or for a consideration per 
share less than the initial conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, then and in each such event the conversion 
price shall be reduced to a price equal to such conversion price multiplied by the following fraction: 
the numerator of which is equal to the deemed number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the number of shares 
of common stock, that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total number of additional shares of 
common stock so issued would purchase at the conversion price immediately prior to such issuance; and 
the denominator of which is equal to the deemed number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to 
such issuance plus the deemed number of additional shares of common stock so issued. 
Series E preferred stock contains a provision for the adjustment of conversion price upon a public offering. In the event of 
such offering, in which the price per share of the Company's common stock is less than $18.55614 (adjusted for stock splits, stock 
dividends, etc.), then the then-existing conversion price for the Series E preferred stock shall be adjusted so that, as of immediately 
prior to the completion of such public offering, each share of Series E preferred stock shall convert into (A) the number of shares of 
common stock issuable on conversion of such share of Series E preferred stock; and (B) an additional number of shares of 
common stock equal to (x) the difference between $18.55614 and the public offering price, (y) divided by the public offering share 
price.

greater than cost upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of employment, or through the exercise of any 
right of first refusal; (v) declare or pay a dividend or other distribution with respect to any shares of the Company's capital stock;
