from the values of the trading floor to the rest of a banking institution. Because 
these things cannot be regulated, the probability is that politicians will focus on 
their political proxies, especially pay. 
The return of Vickers 
The link between what has happened at Barclays and the universal banking argument 
is trust. Preserving the universal bank model relies on public trust that the core retail 
functions of a bank and its trading activities can be properly and completely 
segregated. The UK Independent Commission on Banking chaired by Sir John Vickers 
proposed in 2011 that they could be preserved in a single institution but in separate 
entities, with the retail functions ringfenced with their own higher capital levels. The 
Vickers Commission recommended that all derivatives services should be kept outside 
this ringfence. 
The UK government accepted the argument that retail banks should be able to 
maintain some simple derivatives functions such as products for hedging currency risk 
for business clients. The Barclays experience is already leading politicians and 
commentators in the UK to argue that simple derivatives may be an oxymoron. Trying 
to define them may be a futile exercise, and one that will inevitably be gamed by 
banks. 
The UK government shows some reluctance to revisit its interpretation of the Vickers 
proposals. But if the British Parliamentary enquiry into the LIBOR issue now concludes 
that the government has erred on the side of trusting banks, then the pressure for an 
outcome closer to the original Vickers recommendation, to be written into next year's 
Banking Act, will be intense. 
The universal banking debate will take another serious twist if the new leadership of 
Barclays ultimately decides to break the bank up into a retail bank and an investment 
bank and broker/dealer. As extreme as this sounds, the intangible costs in political and 
regulatory animus Barclays now attracts could suggest that a clean break makes sense. 
An arrangement that gave existing shareholders a stake in both new institutions might 
be acceptable. 
Barclays would no doubt sell such a split as a smart commercial move. But the political 
and regulatory subtext would be to undermine the case that such banking 
agglomerations are both necessary and useful. Although the French and German 
commitment to their own universal banking systems is very strong, such a split would 
certainly empower critics of the universal banking model in the EU and the US. The 
Liikanen Group inquiry is due to report to the European Commission on bank structure 
later this year. The Commission itself is then expected to issue its own 
recommendations on bank structure. Both will certainly draw on the Barclays 
experience. 
The culture question 
This bigger issue about the values of the trading floor is going to prove hard to shake 
off. The role of securities divisions in driving investment bank profits over the last two 
decades has predictably seen a generation of securities managers rise to the 
leadership of investment and universal banks. While it is perhaps unwise to generalise 
too much, most of these men have brought with them the directness and self-belief 
that comes with surviving a career on the trading floor. 
They also bring with them a view of the market and of market-making that is often at 
odds with the way most politicians understand them. Watching Lloyd Blankfein of
