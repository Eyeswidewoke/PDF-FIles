Long or short, Larry Adam? 
Six markt,: ,...,sWs from our Chief Investment Officer for Wealth Management 
in the Americas and Chief Investment Strategist for Deutsche AWM Americas 
Can you usefully quantify and qualify risks to portfolios? 
t0 
Risks to portfolios can come from a number of different 
sources - from central-bank-policy surprises to geopolitical 
developments. Any assessment of such risks cannot be precise, 
in part because many risks are wholly unpredictable. But we still 
think that It is useful to look at the risks that we can foresee and 
then consider not just how likely an event is to occur but also the 
probable portfolio impact. Some risks may not seem particularly 
likely to materialize, but would be very disruptive if they did. 
These are the ones to watch and, if possible, prepare for. 
Are central-bank-policy surprises on this risk list? 
BESI There is still an enormous amount of uncertainty around 
central-bank monetary policy At the top level, this is focused 
on the "when" and "what" questions - e.g. the timing and 
extent of the forthcoming Fed rate-hiking cycle. But there are 
other dimensions to this uncertainty for example, around the 
management of market expectations of policy action. Skepticism 
may also increase about the effectiveness of QE. All this will 
maintain an environment where policy surprises good and bad 
- are possible and could have a major impact on portfolios. 
Can the likely impact of geopolitical events be overemphasized? 
ECU Geopolitical events -- often unforeseen will continue to 
hog the headlines. But it is always worth asking to what extent 
they will have an immediate impact on portfolios. In previous 
decades, their main impact has been via increased oil prices 
due to the threat of supply disruption. This transmission process 
may be less important now given new sources of oil supply. Of 
course, many geopolitical events - for example, the European 
refugee crisis may have a long-term impact on economies and 
investment. But their immediate effects may be more limited 
than first appears. 
Are we now in an "end-cycle" market phase? 
he first interest-rate increase by the Fed is an important 
development in the market cycle. However, it does not constitute 
the end of the cycle- instead, the first rate hike has typically 
marked the middle of the cycle in previous decades. In the sixth 
year of the global recovery, this may sound strange. Keep in 
mind, though, that the recovery has remained lackluster and 
slow. That is why we have described it in the past as the "turtle 
cycle", slow but long-lived. So we expect the cycle to continue 
on its steady upward path, supporting some further market 
gains.

Will positive returns be possible on fixed income too? 
gEn Returns on core government bonds are likely to be 
modest but generally positive. Higher returns are possible on 
investment grade (U.S. and euro). High-yield bonds remain 
interesting in both regions, but less so in the United States. 
where default rates are likely to start rising from current relatively 
low levels Emerging-market debt should offer some interesting 
opportunities but you will need to be selective. 
Are currencies likely to be an important driver of returns? 
isa In recent months we have seen periods of euro strength 
but the fundamentals underpinning a strong U.S. dollar are likely 
to win out. These include stronger U.S. economic growth and 
- perhaps more importantly - expectations of further monetary 
easing by the ECB and the BOJ. So we expect the U.S. dollar 
to make further gains against the euro and, to a lesser extent, 
the Japanese yen and pound sterling. Currency risk must 
also remain an important consideration for emerging-market 
investments.
