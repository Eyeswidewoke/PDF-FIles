FX Blueprint: Forever Young 
This large policy divergence will put further upward 
pressure on USD/CNY, as narrowing rate differentials 
encourage carry-seeking trades to unwind and support 
onshore repayment and refinancing of USD liabilities. A 
simple historical relationship would suggest that for 
every 
100bp of narrowing in rate differentials. 
USDICNY tends to move higher by 30 big figures. 
Finally, FX outflows will likely persist and remain an 
important driver of RMB weakness this year. In 2015, 
China recorded about $700bn of FX outflows despite 
having a sizeable current account surplus. In 2016, we 
believe this will be repeated, considering: 
growth 
headwinds are unlikely to dissipate; and 2) corporate 
are likely to continue to unwind FX liabilities. 
Extrapolating the latest total foreign claims reported by 
BIS (through June 2015), we estimate the total amount 
of FX claims at around $800bn as of end-2015. During 
the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997/8, the FX liabilities of 
Hong Kong. which has a pegged FX regime, fell -40% 
while those of Korea, which has a flexible FX regime, 
fell -55%. Assuming China stays with a managed rate 
of depreciation, this would suggest --$300bn of FY 
liabiiities could still need to be delevereci. This is only 
marginally smaller than the current account forecast of 
$314bn from DB Economics. And there are other 
possible outflows to consider, like: I) increased desire 
for domestic investors to buy more offshore assets, 
evident in an increase in services deficits; and 2) further 
unwind of carry trades, evident in China's widened 
E&O deficit over the past two years. Put together, we 
expect outflows to continue to overwhelm inflows. 
putting upside pressure on USD/CNY. 
We see risk of RMB weakness being front-loaded in 
first half of the year, because 1) current account 
surpluses tend to be smaller in 1H vs. 2H; 2) seasonal 
economic data tends to be weaker in the first half; 3) 
expectations that the Fed will hike more actively in 1H 
(two 25-bp hikes) while the PBoC could cut more 
actively; and 4) ahead of CNY's official entry into the 
IMF's SDR basket on 1 October. 
We favor buying 6M US0/CNY 6.85/7.15 call spreads 
to express our view that RMB weakness is not yet over. 
We also see value in buying USD/TWD as a proxy trade 
to CNY, given the close economic links between the 
two economies and the high beta exhibited by TWD to 
CNY.
