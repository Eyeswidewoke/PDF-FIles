TERMSHEET DISCLAIMER — IMPORTANT NOTICE 
This term sheet has been prepared solely for discussion purposes and does not constitute an offer, an invitation, or a 
recommendation to enter into any transaction. Terms and conditions herein are indicative and subject to change and/or 
negotiation between us. Full details of the final terms and conditions of these instruments will be contained in a prospectus, 
confirmation or other offering document related to this transaction, a copy of which will be available free of charge from 
Deutsche Bank. Although the information herein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, we do not warrant 
its accuracy, completeness, or fairness. Opinions and estimates may be changed without notice and involve a number of 
assumptions which may not prove valid. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 
We are not acting as your financial advisor or in any other fiduciary capacity in respect of this proposed transaction or in any 
other transaction with you unless otherwise agreed in writing. 
We or our affiliates or persons associated with us or such affiliates ("Associated Persons") may at any time maintain as part 
of our hedging or trading activities a long or short position in securities referred to herein or underlying constituents 
thereof, or in related futures or options, purchase or sell, make a market in, or engage in any other transaction involving 
such securities, as well as earn brokerage or other compensation. While Deutsche Bank's trading or hedging activities are 
not intended to have any significant impact upon prices, our dealings could affect the price you pay or receive for 
transactions in these or related securities. 
Calculations of returns on the securities referred to herein are linked to a particular market measure, reference entity, 
security or credit, the performance of which may affect the amount or timing of payments to be made or received in 
connection with this proposed transaction. As such, the investments may not be suitable for persons unfamiliar with such 
basis of reference, or unwilling or unable to bear the risks associated with the transaction. The securities referred to herein 
involve risk, which may include interest rate, index, currency, credit, political, liquidity, time value, commodity, and market 
risk. In addition, products denominated in a currency other than the investor's home currency will be subject to changes in 
exchange rates, which may have an adverse effect on the value, price, or income return of the products. These risks are 
interrelated in complex ways, and as a result, the effect of any one factor may be offset or magnified by the effect of 
another factor, and the term sheet does not identify all risks (direct or indirect) or other considerations which might be 
material to you when entering into the transaction. 
There may be no secondary market for the instruments and the products may not be readily realizable investments.
