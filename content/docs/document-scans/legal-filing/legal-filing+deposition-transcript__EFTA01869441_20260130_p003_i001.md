Ocean which as discussed could be zero to $14M. 
This does not account for cash, securities, other business interests, any other real estate outside PB, and 
tangibles. I do not have any information about these. I do not know of other assets and I do not think he has 
a pending project. 
He does have a pending and very active lawsuit against him by Leo Vecellio (Ranger Construction) who 
bought 589 N County. This is a very acrimonious suit. Vecellio is seeking several million in damages for 
construction defects and recently amended the suit to allege fraud by Dan, his wife, and his backer Dean 
DeSantis (son of Carl of Rexall-Sundown) and his wife. The fraud alleged is that Dan concealed water 
damage during construction due to hurricanes. This is well publicized and seems to be getting nastier and I 
assume very expensive to defend. 
Value of 1220 
Dan has reduced the ask from $84 million to $64 million. Evidently appraisals were made by TD and NPCM in 
January that were in the $40s. Dan has asked that the TD appraisal be revised because of Moens sale of 
1255 S Ocean (the ex Krakoff lot) to the south for $22.7+ to Petterfy. (Swanson paid $20.6 for the land at 
1220.) He thinks/hopes 1220 will now appraise in the $50s. 
The nearest competition is Sandra Hammond's house at 1275 SOB listed by Cris Condon of 
Sotheby's at $42.5. I do not think there have been offers. Swanson sold the house to Hammond 
from plans. It recorded as a $15M land sale but she is supposed to have paid more than $26M in 
total. Interestingly, Petterfy got interested in the land at 1255 while looking at 1275. 1275 has 
13,300 sf on 170 lakefront feet (270 depth) and is basically a smaller version of 1220 (27.350 sf on 
200+ feet by 450 feet depth). 
The sense of the PB brokers is that 1220 will bring a $40 number. 
There has been a lot of activity in PB this season in the $20-$30 range (sales and offers). But the fact is that so 
far the high sale this season will be $29.1 for 40 Blossom Way (190 feet on the ocean) which (Moens says) 
Moens and his partner (Bill Kallop) are buying and leasing to Petterfy for 5 years while he builds on 1255 
which they owned and sold to him. 
Discussion 
Dan is shell-shocked. He doesn't think Kosoy will extend the second so he fears losing 1220 in November 
before next season provides an opportunity to sell it. I don't think he is likely to have many alternatives over 
the summer. 
Its obvious that one could structure a second with a high rate of interest and an interest reserve. I think Dan 
would agree. The combined first and second would at $30,200,000 represent 75% loan to expected sales 
value ratio -possibly a lower ratio if appraised value is used. 
Since 1220 is owned by a single asset LLC, there seem to be some obvious techniques to limit exposure to 
delays in possession on default or in the event of an LLC bankruptcy including taking a membership position 
in the LLC and amending the operating agreement to require consent to certain actions like bankruptcy, sale 
and refinancings. Taking an LLC membership position in addition to the mortgage could also be a vehicle for 
a profit participation in the event of a successful sale. Given the LLC's position, the FMV of an equity position 
would be modest. 
If Dan (the LLC) defaulted, and the second mortgage holder acquired the first for $20,200,000, then it would 
have $30,200,000 in. If the house sold at $40 million or slightly above, it would represent a return of $10 
milion (plus interest) in a year on a $10,000,000 debt position.
