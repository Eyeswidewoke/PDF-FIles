Jeffrey E=stein's loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously lenient. They in=ist 
that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal a=d essentially harmless. As the police records 
attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could "say no" at any t=me during a massage as Epstein 
escalated contact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in every victim's statement: First she would be 
asked to remove her s=irt, then her pants. 
and the more willing girls were lured into full-
blown sexual relations with both Epstein and 
who was referred to in press accounts and pol=ce 
reports as Epstein's live-in "sex slave." 
A former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S=, confirmed that MC2 
girls became frequent guests on Epstein's privat= jets. 
It's true that so=e underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily several times—
although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any=bearing on the criminality of the contact, particularly if the 
girl was 16 or younger.=But what is particularly disturbing about this case—judging by arrangem=nts at the Palm Beach 
house—is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager,=organized his life around this sexual compulsion in an open 
and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law.
