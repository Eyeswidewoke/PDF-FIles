No. Because tender proceeds received from Plan Shares will be received by and held in the Savings and Retirement Plan, 
they will not be subject to current income taxes. 
D. REINVESTMENT OF TENDER OFFER PROCEEDS 
20. How will the Savings and Retirement Plan invest the proceeds received f=om the Plan Shares that are tendered? 
Proceeds received from this Offer will be reinvested by the Trustee in a money market fund and reinvested in the 
investment funds you have selected under the Savings and Retirement Plan as soon as practicable in accordance with 
your future contribution election in effect at the date of such reinvestment. 
E. CERTAIN TAX INFORMATION 
Participants in the Savings and Retirement Plan should be aware that the reinvestment of the cash proceeds received in 
the Offer may, in certain circumstances, result in certain tax consequences to those participants who, as part of the 
ultimate distributions of their accounts, would receive Shares. 
Special tax rules apply to certain distributions from the Savings and Retirement Plan that consist, in whole or in part, of 
Shares. Generally, taxation of net unrealized appreciation ("NUA"), an amount equal =o the excess of the value of such 
Shares at distribution over the cost or other basis of such Shares (which will vary depending on whether the distribution 
qualifies for lump sum treatment) will be deferred until the Shares are sold following distribution. Moreover, if Shares 
are disposed of prior to a distribution, as would be the case in the Offer, and the proceeds of such disposition are 
reinvested within 90 days thereafter in the Limited, Inc. Stock Fund, the cost or other basis of such newly acquired 
Shares for NUA purposes will be the cost or other basis of the tendered Shares. 
Accordingly, if the cash proceeds receivable upon the tender of Shares is not reinvested in the Limited, Inc. Stock Fund 
under the Savings and Retirement Plan within 90 days, the opportunity to retain for NUA purposes the cost or other 
basis of the Shares tendered, and the tax-deferral treatment of the NUA calculated in reference to such basis, will be 
lost. 
The foregoing is only a brief summary of complicated provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. You are strongly urged to 
consult with your tax advisor as to the issues described above.
