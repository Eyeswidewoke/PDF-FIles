At its national convention in Chicago. held in 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor 
Unions (which later became the American Federation of Labor), proclaimed that "eight hours shall 
constitute a legal day's labor from and after May 1, 1886." The following year, the FOTLU, backed by 
many Knights of Labor locals, reiterated their proclamation stating that it would be supported by strikes 
and demonstrations. At first, most radicals and anarchists regarded this demand as too reformist, failing to 
strike "at the root of the evil." A year before the Haymarket Massacre, Samuel Fielden pointed out in the 
anarchist newspaper, The Alarm, that "whether a man works eight hours a day or ten hours a day, he is 
still a slave." 
Despite the misgivings of many of the anarchists, an estimated quarter million workers in the Chicago 
area became directly involved in the crusade to implement the eight hour work day, including the Trades 
and Labor Assembly, the Socialistic Labor Party and local Knights of Labor. As more and more of the 
workforce mobilized against the employers, these radicals conceded to fight for the 8-hour day. realizing 
that "the tide of opinion and determination of most wage-workers was set in this direction." With the 
involvement of the anarchists, there seemed to be an infusion of greater issues than the 8-hour day. There 
grew a sense of a greater social revolution beyond the more immediate gains of shortened hours, but a 
drastic change in the economic structure of capitalism. 
In a proclamation printed just before May I, 1886, one publisher appealed to working people with this 
plea: 
• 
Workingmen to Arms! 
• 
War to the Palace, Peace to the Cottage, and Death to LUXURIOUS IDLENESS. 
• 
The wage system is the only cause of the World's misery. It is supported by the rich classes, and 
to destroy it, they must be either made to work or DIE. 
• 
One pound of DYNAMITE is better than a bushel of BALLOTS! 
• 
MAKE YOUR DEMAND FOR EIGHT HOURS with weapons in your hands to meet the 
capitalistic bloodhounds, police, and militia in proper manner. 
Not surprisingly the entire city was prepared for mass bloodshed, reminiscent of the railroad strike a 
decade earlier when police and soldiers gunned down hundreds of striking workers. On May 1, 1886, 
more than 300,000 workers in 13,000 businesses across the United States walked off their jobs in the first 
May Day celebration in history. In Chicago, the epicenter for the 8-hour day agitators, 40.000 went out on 
strike with the anarchists in the forefront of the public's eye. With their fiery speeches and revolutionary 
ideology of direct action, anarchists and anarchism became respected and embraced by the working 
people and despised by the capitalists. 
The names of many - Albert Parsons. Johann Most. August Spies and Louis Lingg - became household 
words in Chicago and throughout the country. Parades, bands and tens of thousands of demonstrators in 
the streets exemplified the workers' strength and unity, yet didn't become violent as the newspapers and 
authorities predicted. 
More and more workers continued to walk off their jobs until the numbers swelled to nearly 100,000, yet 
peace prevailed. It was not until two days later, May 3, 1886, that violence broke out at the McCormick 
Reaper Works between police and strikers.
