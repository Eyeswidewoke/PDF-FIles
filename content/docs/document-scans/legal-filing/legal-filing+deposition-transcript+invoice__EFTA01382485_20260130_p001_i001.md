Bank Credit Agreement At January 3, 2015, the Company had a $1,500.0 million credit agreement (the 'Credit Agreement") with 
a syndicate of banks that was scheduled to terminate on June 1, 2015. The Credit Agreement provided to Safeway (i) a four-year 
revolving domestic credit facility of up to $1,250.0 million for U.S. dollar advances and (ii) a $400.0 million subfacility of the domestic 
facility for issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also provided for an increase in the credit facility 
commitments up to an additional $500.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. On June 30, 2014, the Company 
terminated a $250.0 million Canadian credit facility. The Credit Agreement contained various covenants that restricted, among other 
things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of Safeway and its subsidiaries to incur certain liens, make certain asset sales, enter 
into certain mergers or amalgamations, engage in certain transactions with stockholders and affiliates and alter the character of its 
business from that conducted on the closing date. The Credit Agreement also contained two financial maintenance covenants: (i) an
