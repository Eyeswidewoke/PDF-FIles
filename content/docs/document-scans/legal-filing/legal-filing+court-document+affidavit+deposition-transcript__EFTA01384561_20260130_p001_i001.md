HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
The application of non-U.S. tax laws (e.g., the imposition of withholding taxes on 
dividend or interest payments, income taxes and excise taxes) or confiscatory taxation, as 
well as various other laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws, may 
also affect the Capital Structure Fund's investment in non-U.S. securities and its other 
investments in entities located outside the United States. The Fund may incur higher 
expenses from investment in non-U.S. securities and outside the United States, in 
particular, in emerging markets, than from investment in U.S. securities and in non-
emerging markets because of the costs that must be incurred in connection with 
conversions between various currencies and because non-U.S. brokerage commissions 
may be higher than commissions in the United States. Non-U.S. markets also may be 
less liquid, more volatile and subject to less stringent governmental supervision than in 
the United States. The Capital Structure Fund's investments in non-U.S. countries could 
be adversely affected by other factors not present in the United States, including lack of 
uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and potential difficulties 
in enforcing contractual obligations and in hedging market risk. 
Valuation Risk; Use of Estimates 
Valuation agents value the Capital Structure Fund's positions using the methodologies set 
forth in the Capital Structure Fund's PPM and the administrator calculates the net asset 
value of the Capital Structure Fund based on pricing information gathered. Such 
valuations will affect the Capital Structure Management Fee and the Capital Structure 
Incentive Fee received by Hudson Bay Capital and its affiliates. 
The values of the Capital Structure Fund's positions are based, to the extent possible, on 
independent third-party pricing sources, which may include quotes provided by brokers 
and dealers and valuation agents. However, it is not unusual for the prices quoted by 
dealers for informational purposes to materially differ from the prices at which the same 
dealers are willing to actually enter into transactions. This discrepancy can cause 
unexpected net asset value declines if the Capital Structure Fund is required to sell a 
position which it had been valuing based upon dealers' marks. Moreover, certain 
valuations cannot be made on the basis of third-party pricing sources. The fair market 
value of those investments of the Capital Structure Fund for which a reliable third-party 
quote is not available is based on other relevant sources deemed reliable by a valuation 
agent and other third-party valuation agents as well as Hudson Bay Capital, in their good 
faith judgment. To the extent that there is a pricing uncertainty beyond acceptable 
tolerances, the final authority ultimately rests with Hudson Bay Capital to resolve such 
uncertainty. Hudson Bay Capital will not bear any liability if a price, reasonably believed 
by it to be an accurate valuation of a particular direct or indirect investment of the Capital 
Structure Fund, is subsequently found to be inaccurate.
