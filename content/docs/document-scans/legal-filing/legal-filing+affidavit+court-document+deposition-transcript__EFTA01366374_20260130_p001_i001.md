Compensation Committee 
Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish a 
compensation committee of the board of directors. The members of our Compensation Committee will be Messrs. 
Weiss and Kerr. Mr. Weiss will serve as chairman of the compensation committee. We will adopt a compensation 
committee charter, which will detail the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 
• reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief 
Executive Officer's compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer's performance in light of such 
goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive 
Officer's based on such evaluation; 
• reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers;

arrangements for our executive officers and employees; 
• producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 
• reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate. to the remuneration for directors. 
The charter will also provide that the compensation committee may. in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the 
advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the 
appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving 
advice from a compensation consultant. external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee 
will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by NASDAQ and the SEC. 
We may pay a member of our combined team (or an entity affiliated with a member of our combined team) a 
fee for financial advisory services rendered in connection with our identification, negotiation and consummation 
of our initial business combination. The fee will only be payable upon closing of our initial business combination.
