2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
John Nemelka filed an objection to the settlement date June 15, 2016, objecting to the 
caps on reimbursements for Class members whose timing chain or timing chain tensioners 
were repaired at independent service centers. ECF No. 100. Mr. Nemelka states that, in 
December 2015, he had his Class Vehicle repaired at an independent service center, 
rather than at his local BMW dealership, to "save money." Id. at 1. The repair cost 
$1,778.45. Id. Mr. Nemelka correctly states that, had the repair been done at the BMW 
dealership, he would be entitled to a full reimbursement under the settlement terms. 
Because the repair was conducted by a third party, he is entitled to only $970. 
To repeat, Defendants informed Class members of the alleged timing chain and tensioner 
defect in October 2014 and instructed them to seek repairs, free of charge (and subject to 
a full reimbursement), at authorized MINI service centers. See ECF No. 86-6 Ex. 1. 
Plaintiffs explain that Defendants required a cap on reimbursements for repairs from third-
party service centers because they have no control over the prices charged p441 at third-
party center& Particularly in light of the early disclosure about repairs at authorized MINI 
service centers, the Court finds that the cap on reimbursements for repairs at independent 
service centers is not unreasonable. 
p. Objection of James Jones 
James Jones submitted an objection, dated June 19, 2016, that was filed in this Court on 
June 29, 2016. ECF No. 101. Mr. Jones objects to the settlement on three grounds: first, 
that the settlement does not provide relief for owners of Class Vehicles that have not yet 
displayed any defects; second, that the documentation requirement for reimbursement is 
unduly burdensome, especially for the owners of used Class Vehicles; and third, that the 
final approval hearing should not be held until the deadline to submit objections has 
expired. 
The Court disagrees with Mr. Jones's first and second objections for the reasons already 
discussed; the settlement allows Class members to receive repairs and replacements of 
allegedly defective parts even if their vehicles have not displayed damage, and Class 
members are in a better position than Defendants to document their vehicles' histories. 
With regard to the third objection, the fairness hearing [`45] was held on July 14, 2016, 
after the July 1, 2016 deadline for N14 Class members to submit objections under the 
Court's supplemental notice program. See ECF No. 89. 
q. Objection of Shirley M. Stipe-Zendle 
Docket number 102, filed as an objection to the settlement on June 29, 2016, appears 
instead to be a claim for reimbursement for timing chain tensioner/timing chain repair or 
replacement submitted by Class member Shirley M. Stipe-Zendle. ECF No. 102. The 
document contains no objection to the settlement. Plaintiffs state that they have provided 
the document to the Claims Administrator for processing as a claim. ECF No. 107 at 7. 
r. Objection of Julie A. Clifford 
Julie Ann Clifford submitted an objection to the settlement that was filed on June 29, 2016. 
ECF No. 103. Ms. Clifford objects to the settlement on three grounds: (a) the 
documentation requirement for engine repair reimbursement unreasonably requires the
