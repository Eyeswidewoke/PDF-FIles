DESCRIPTION OF THE WARRANTS TO PURCHASE DEBT SECURITIES 
The following statements with respect to the debt warrants are summaries of the material provisions of a 
debt warrant agreement to be entered into by us and a debt warrant agent to be selected at the time of issue. The 
debt warrant agreement may include or incorporate by reference standard warrant provisions substantially in the 
form of the Debt Warrant Agreement filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus 
forms a part. 
General 
The debt warrants, evidenced by debt warrant certificates. may be issued under the debt warrant agreement 
independently or together with any other securities offered by any prospectus supplement and may be attached to 
or separate from such other offered securities. If debt warrants are offered, the related prospectus supplement will 
describe the designation and terms of the debt warrants, including without limitation the following: 
the offering price, if any; 
• 
the designation. aggregate principal amount and terms of the debt securities purchasable upon exercise 
of the debt warrants; 
• 
if applicable, the date on and after which the debt warrants and the related offered securities will be 
separately transferable; 
• 
the principal amount of debt securities purchasable upon exercise of one debt warrant and the price at 
which such principal amount of debt securities may be purchased upon exercise; 
• 
the date on which the right to exercise the debt wan-ants shall commence and the date on which such 
right shall expire; 
• 
a discussion of certain United States Federal income tax considerations; 
• 
whether the warrants represented by the debt warrant certificates will be issued in registered or bearer 
form; 
• 
the currency, currencies or currency units in which the offering price, if any, and exercise price arc

Warrantholders will not have any of the rights of holders of debt securities, including the right to receive the 
payment of principal of, any premium or interest on. or any additional amounts with respect to. the debt 
securities or to enforce any of the covenants of the debt securities or the applicable W. R. Berkley indenture, 
except as otherwise provided in the applicable W. R. Berkley indenture. 
Exercise of Debt Warrants 
Debt warrants may be exercised by surrendering the debt warrant certificate at the office of the debt warrant 
agent, with the form of election to purchase on the reverse side of the debt warrant certificate properly completed 
and executed, and by payment in full of the exercise price, as set forth in the related prospectus supplement. The 
signature must be guaranteed by a bank or trust company. by a broker or dealer which is a member of FINRA or 
by a member of a national securities exchange. Upon the exercise of debt warrants, we will issue the debt 
securities in authorized denominations in accordance with the instructions of the exercising warrantholder. If less 
than all of the debt warrants evidenced by the debt warrant certificate are exercised, a new debt warrant 
certificate will be issued for the remaining number of debt warrants.
