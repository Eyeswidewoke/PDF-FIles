s-tough-words-iran/4073> and to forge an implicit alliance with Saudi Arabia based on a common threat. For the Sunni 
monarchies in the Gulf, isn't the existence of a nuclear, Shiite Iran <http://worldcrunch.com/yet-another-round-iranian-
nuclear-talks-fail-where-now/5695> as much a threat to their existence as it is to the Jewish State 
<http://worldcrunch.com/new-battle-change-what-it-means-be-jewish-israel/4064> ? Other potentially instable 
borders are the ones with Syria <http://worldcrunch.com/israels-syria-conundrum/2905> and Lebanon. Predicting the 
unavoidable fall of the Syrian regime as Israeli leaders regularly do isn't just "standing on the right side of history," it's 
also, as for Iran, taking a common position with the Gulf monarchies. Israel is clearly taking advantage of a violent and 
confusing situation that helps divert the world's attention from the never-ending Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
The more events speed up in the Arab world through this long-term revolutionary process, the more it appears 
possible for Israel to keep the status quo on the ground with the Palestinians; a political status quo that doesn't prevent 
Israeli settlements <http://worldcrunch.com/israel-s-enemy-within-why-radical-west-bank-settlers-put-country-
risk/4322> , far from it. Around Jerusalem, the situation -- with multiple faits accomplis -- has become inextricable. It 
would take hundreds of geographers and surveyors to negotiate every inch of an acceptable compromise. 
In such a situation, when ones arrives in Israel -- despite the rockets that strike the south of the country from the 
Sinai -- it isn't surprising to be struck by a feeling of almost unreal serenity. Is this, like a decade ago, the calm before the 
storm? Are we on the verge of a third Intifada, closer to the first than the second (protests by stone-throwing as 
opposed to human bombs)? 
What is sure is that there is among many young Palestinians an undeniable form of religious and political 
radicalization. The convergence between rising Islamism in the Arab world and the humiliation and despair of the 
Palestinian youth is pushing them to abandon all spirit of compromise. "Because I am nothing, I want everything, all of 
Palestine, without its Jewish occupiers!" 
The contrast is much too important between the movements that are speeding up at Israel's borders and the 
frozen situation in the Palestinian territories. Of course, compared to the current Syrian situation, they might seem 
better off, and they don't want to renew the "savagery" of the second Intifada. But a man cannot live on bread alone. 
He needs hope, and Palestinians have none. In the Middle East, in spite of appearances, time is not working in Israel's 
favor. <http://worldcrunch.com/rage-and-diplomacy-has-israel-lost-its-last-allies-muslim-world/3745>

The National Interest 
Egypt's Demographic and Environmental Time Bombs 
Geoffrey Kemp <http://nationalinterest.org/profile/geoffrey-kemp> 
July 6, 2012 -- It may take many months for Egyptians to learn whether the Muslim Brotherhood and its newly 
elected President Mohamed Morsi have achieved meaningful power or whether the Egyptian Army remains the true 
broker in the country. Either way, whoever emerges as the de facto leader of Egypt will be faced with the awkward 
reality of more fundamental indicators—Egypt's demography, geography, economy and environment. These pose 
predicaments that threaten to overwhelm the country. 
Egypt's current population is around eighty-two million, with an annual growth rate of about 2 percent. The 
population could reach nearly 115 million in about fifteen years. Most of the population resides in the lush Nile Delta
