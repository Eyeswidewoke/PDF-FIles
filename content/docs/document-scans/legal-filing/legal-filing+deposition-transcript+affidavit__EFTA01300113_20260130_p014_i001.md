Dubai and vice versa. Dubai has always welcomed business and investments from across the UAE. 
Regarding the speculations you referred to in your question, they will always remain just speculations. I believe 
they are meant to be evil gossip as part of a vicious campaign against Dubai model. These speculations were not 
only refuted by Dubai government officials but also by His Highness the President of the UAE last March.

Do you believe that the UAE economy will contract this year? Or still it achieve certain 
growth? And at what percent? 
We are confident that our national establishments' abilities, combined with the economic measures undertaken by 
the government, will lead to economic growth this year. Yet, we expect that growth may not come at the same 
rate of pervious growth records we sustained over the past few years. While speculating global economic 
contraction of 0.5 percent, international financial bodies forecast a slight growth for the UAE economy. Other 
forecasts speculate a 3 percent growth for the UAE economy.

Maybe every cloud has a silver lining. The financial crisis has restored balance to the 
markets following years of inflation which posed a threat to Dubai's and the UAE's 
economies. Do you see this tough correction, for instance to the real estate market, a good 
solution to a problem that could have escalated in the future? 
Sometimes opportunities are born from the wombs of crises. The most important thing is to focus on the future 
and develop appropriate frameworks that guarantee highest levels of performance on heels of the crisis. Measures 
undertaken by the government on both local and federal levels will ensure that we shall emerge from the global 
financial crisis with least damage. The UAE has proven remarkable ability in facing and overcoming previous 
crises. Specialized committees and task forces are closely monitoring the development of the global crisis and 
analyzing its impacts on our economy and subsequently propose action plans to resiliently cope with these 
ongoing changes.

Many rumors are targeting Dubai claiming it has turned into a ghost city and that tens of 
thousands are being laid off every week. Don't you feel upset about these rumors and the 
way the impact of the crisis has been perceived outside Dubai? 
Actually, we don't pay attention to rumors and our response always comes in actions rather than words. As a 
matter of fact, Dubai visitors these days are surprised by these rumors and I've met with many of them recently 
and they expressed their amazement at Dubai's traffic jams, overbooked hotels and crowded markets. 
Dubai's success -- which it has sustained over the past years -- is the true reason behind this type of mixed 
reports. Those who spread such rumors — are they aware of the fact that global nature of Dubai makes it more 
subject to impacts of global changes than any other city? We totally endorse freedom of expression but we 
always urge responsible freedom that promotes principles of integrity and objectivity. 
It is truly sad to find international publications that have usually boasted about factual and precise reporting 
issuing articles based on mere rumors and baseless speculations. We are fully aware of the hidden fierce global
