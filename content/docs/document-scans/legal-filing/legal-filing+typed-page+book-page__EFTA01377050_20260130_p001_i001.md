The timing of the next Fed rate hike continues to be an elusive debate for 
investors. Earlier this week, there were a number of Fed speakers on the tape 
that fostered sentiment on both sides of the argument. San Francisco Fed 
President John Williams struck a dovish tone on Tuesday as his comments 
calling for central banks to raise their inflation targets in the midst of the current 
sluggish global growth environment drove the USD to near a two month low. In 
contrast, William Dudley sounded more hawkish as he acknowledged that he 
would not rule out two rate hikes this year (leaving a September rate hike on 
the table) and that markets may be too complacent with respect to future rate 
hikes. This potential complacency has been seen as equity markets continue to 
grind to all time highs, volatility remains non-existent and recent weakness in 
the USD despite continued QE from the European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of 
England (BoE) and Bank of Japan (BoJ). Investor complacency could also be 
seen through the market reaction to the release of the Minutes from the July 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Although the Minutes 
acknowledged that some Fed officials believed labor market conditions were at 
or close to those consistent with maximum employment" and that rate hikes 
might be "warranted soon," both equities and bonds rallied, while the USD sold 
off. Additionally, while this statement may be seen as slightly more upbeat on 
the economic outlook relative to recent FOMC statements, the probability of a 
rate hike in September or December fell to 23% and 48% respectively. 
Next week investor attention will turn to Janet Yellen, as she will speak at the 
Kansas City Fed's Economic Symposium at Jackson Hole. This event has 
been market moving in the past as former Chairs of the FOMC, particularly Ben 
Bemanke and Alan Greenspan, have used Jackson Hole as a venue to 
announce dramatic changes in monetary policy. With a title of "Designing 
Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future for this year's event, we 
believe that Janet Yellen could use her speech to establish a framework to 
prepare markets for the timing and magnitude of future rate hikes. While we see 
a low probability of a September rate hike, we believe a rate hike in December 
is likely because of a number of economic factors. First, the weakness in the 
May jobs report appears to be an anomaly as the three month moving average 
of job gains (190k) continues to point to strong labor market gains. Second, 
average hourly earnings (+2.6% YoY) are growing at the fastest pace since 
July 2009 and should support both consumer spending and push inflation to the 
upper end of the Fed's target range. Third, while the Atlanta Fed GDPNow 
model forecasts Q3 2016 GDP to be +3.6%, recent data on manufacturing, 
housing and employment could also alleviate concerns emanating from the 
weakness in the first half of the year. 
Outside of Jackson Hole, there will be a number of economic data points 
released next week. Some of the key releases next week will be new (released 
Tuesday) and existing (Wednesday) home sales, durable goods orders 
Deutsche Bank 
(Thursday), international trade (Friday), consumer sentiment (Friday) and the 
Wealth Management 
second reading of O216 GDP (Friday).
