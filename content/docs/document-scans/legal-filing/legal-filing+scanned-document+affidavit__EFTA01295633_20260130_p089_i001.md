2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82496,
named in a policy of insurance, or any special favor or advantage in the dividends or other benefits to accrue thereon. 
or any valuable consideration or inducement whatever. not specified in the policy of insurance, except to the extent that 
such rebate. discount. abatement, credit, reduction. favor. advantage or consideration may be provided for in rating-
systems filed by or on behalf of such insurer and approved by the commissioner. No insured named in a policy of 
insurance . . . shall knowingly receive or accept. directly or indirectly, any such rebate, discount. abatement. or 
reduction of premium, or any such special favor or advartage or valuable consideration or inducement. 
N.J.S.A. 17:29A-15. 
Plaintiff DiGiacomo alleges that AMIG Defendants paid and Statebridge accepted, as an 
inducement to insurance, or after insurance has been effected, kickbacks that would 
qualify as the sort of payments p21] prohibited by N.J.S.A. 17:29A-15. 
The filed rate doctrine cannot offer any protection against such a charge. While the 
doctrine precludes a borrower from bringing a claim challenging the rate of force-placed 
insurance, Plaintiff here is not challenging the rate: a finding in his favor would establish 
only that Defendants engaged in an unlawful kickback scheme that was not disclosed to 
New Jersey regulators, not cast doubt on any determination such regulators made that a 
certain rate is reasonable. In imposing a rate that regulators deem reasonable, Defendants 
may nonetheless engage in conduct that violates, as Plaintiff alleges, the NJCFA or RICO 
statutes or Defendants' contractual and fiduciary obligations. 
Statebridge's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint based on the filed rate doctrine will 
therefore be denied. 
B. Breach of Contract 
Statebridge next argues that Plaintiff cannot claim breach of contract because Statebridge 
was not a party to the contract, the contract authorized the actions alleged to be unlawful, 
and Plaintiff did not perform his own duties under the contract. 
a. Statebridge was plausibly a party to the mortgage contract. 
Only a party to a contract can be found liable for breach of [*22] contract, and a loan 
servicer is not an original party to a mortgage agreement between a lender and a borrower 
as a matter of law.'° However, a loan servicer can become a party to a mortgage 
agreement between a lender and a borrower via assignment, and whether or not such 
assignment has occurred is a question of fact. See Ellsworth v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 30 F. 
Supp. 3d 886, 913 (N.D. Cal. 2014) ("[A] servicer can stand in the shoes of the party to the 
contract to the extent that rights are assigned. If rights are not assigned, then [loan 
servicer] U.S. Bank is off the hook for breach of contract."). Not only is it "plausible to infer 
that 'a servicer can stand in the shoes of the party to the contract to the extent that rights 
are assigned[]' . . . it is somewhat implausible that the servicers acquired the rights to 
enforce the lender's rights under the deed of trust without becoming parties to the 
contract." Perryman v. Litton Loan Servicing, LP, No. 14-CV-02261-JST, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 140479, 2014 WL 4954674, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 1, 2014) (quoting Ellsworth, 30 F. 
Supp. 3d at 913)(emphasis in original). In Perryman, as in Ellsworth, the Court declared 
the matter a fact issue for which Plaintiff would need to produce evidence of assignment 
but found "nothing implausible about the allegation." Id.
