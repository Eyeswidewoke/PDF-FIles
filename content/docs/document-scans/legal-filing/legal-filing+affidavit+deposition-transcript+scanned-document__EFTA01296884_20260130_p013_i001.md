United States Courts Opinions: Supreme Court of New York: Neary v Burns US Official 
News April 1, 2014 Tuesday 
was also no showing of prejudice or surprise resulting directly from plaintiffs' delay in 
seeking leave, the court, at oral argument held on November 20, 2013, granted plaintiffs' 
motion for leave to file their second amended verified complaint. While Burns' motion was 
originally directed as against plaintiffs' first amended complaint, since the court has 
granted plaintiffs' motion to amend their first amended complaint during the pendency of 
Burns' motion, the court will address this motion as against plaintiffs' second amended 
complaint (see 49 W. 12 Tenants Corp. v Seidenberg, 6 AD3d 243, 243 [1st Dept 2004]; 
Livadiotakis v Tzitzikalakis, 302 AD2d 369, 370 [2d Dept 2003]; Sage Realty Corp. v 
Proskauer Rose, 251 AD2d 35, 38 (1st Dept 1998]). 
DISCUSSION 
In support of his instant motion, Bums argues that this action must be dismissed based 
upon plaintiffs' lack of standing to sue. CPLR 3211 (a) (3) provides for dismissal [*7]of an 
action where "the party asserting the cause of action has not legal capacity to sue." CPLR 
3211(a) (3) also embraces the ground of the lack of standing to sue, and this statute is, 
therefore, available to support a motion to dismiss on this ground (see Hecht v Andover 
Assocs. Mgt. Corp., 2014 NY Slip Op 0063, *2 (2d Dept 2014]). 
Burns, in arguing that plaintiffs lack standing to sue, relies upon the third affirmative 
defense in his answer to the first amended complaint and contends that plaintiffs are not 
proper parties and lack standing to sue 2784 LLC and him, as its former manager, 
because they are allegedly not members of 2784 LLC in their individual capacities. 
Burns argues that Neary is not a proper party and lacks standing to sue because the 
member of 2784 LLC is the Neary Group, as opposed to Neary. He points to Schedule A 
of the Operating Agreement (exhibit 2 to his motion papers), which lists the Neary Group 
as consisting of three members with a 18.4% voting percentage interest, and the footnote 
to that Schedule which states that the three Nearys (Weary, Salvatore, and Mary Ann) 
have each contributed 100% of their respective undivided interest as tenants in common in 
the 2784 premises to 2784 LLC, and that "[t]he Neary Group owns an 18.4% Member 
Interest as a group," and "has appointed Mary Ann . . . to represent them in voting their 
total 18.4% Voting Percentage Interest until otherwise notified in writing by them." 
Burns' argument must be rejected. The membership interest of the Nearys was referred to 
as the Neary Group simply because their interest in the 2784 premises derived from Anna 
and thereafter passed to Neary and his two siblings, which formed the Neary Group. The 
mere fact that Neary permitted Mary Ann to vote the collective 18.4% of the Neary Group 
does not negate Neary's status as an individual member of 2784 LLC in his own individual 
right with a 6.1333% (one-third of 18.4%) ownership interest. Indeed, Schedule A of the 
Operating Agreement lists Neary separately as a "Member" and sets forth his residence 
address and social security number. In fact, Neary was an initial member of 2784 LLC at 
the time of its formation in 2006, and he signed the initial Operating Agreement and the 
Amended and Restated Operating Agreement as an "Initial Member' (see exhibit A to 
plaintiffs' opposition papers). Additionally, Neary, by an e-mail dated February 24, 2010 
(exhibit C to plaintiffs' opposition papers), gave Burns written notice of his intent to vote his 
own 6.133% membership interest separately. Thus, Neary has established that he is, in 
fact, an individual member of 2784 LLC and entitled to maintain this action in his own right 
without the joinder of the other members of the Neary Group.
