an indication of its outsize importance as a symbol of prosecutorial independence — and its enduring role in 
President Trump's own long, tortured relationship with the department since his first term. But his forceful tack is 
also a measure of his own fraught relationship with an office that provided him with the know-how and confidence 
to now challenge its power and autonomy. The article included interviews with more than two dozen former 
colleagues, current department officials and others, that reveal new details about Bove's nine years at the 
Southern District, a turbulent period that defined his career and foreshadowed his current effort to bend the DOJ 
to President Trump's agenda. The article noted that Bove racked up convictions at trial and in guilty pleas, as in one 
case of a Hezbollah operative and another with an FBI employee accused of being an agent for China. A high point, 
former colleagues said, was the successful prosecution and trial of the man who detonated a pressure-cooker 
bomb in Manhattan and was sentenced to two life terms in prison. 
Federal Agencies Can Ignore "What Did You Do Last Week?" Email, Trump Administration Says 
CBS News (02/25, Ake, Brown, Yilek) reported that the office that asked federal workers to document five things 
they accomplished over the past week told executive branch officials on Monday that individual agencies can 
decide how to respond, despite a threat from Elon Musk that employees who refused could lose their jobs. Two 
officials said that the Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, held a call with the heads of human capital at 
federal agencies and said it's up to each entity to determine how they want to handle the directive employees 
received Saturday. Federal employees received an email from OPM with the subject line "What did you do last 
week?" The message instructed recipients to reply with five examples of what they did over the past seven days, 
without revealing any classified information. Musk, who is leading the Department of Government Efficiency, 
known as DOGE, said that employees' failure to respond would be taken as a resignation. The email set a deadline 
of 11:59 p.m. Monday to respond. President Trump publicly backed the effort at the White House earlier in the day. 
The article mentioned that the original message sparked confusion, and several agencies told workers to ignore the 
request, including the DOJ, the FBI, the State Department, the Pentagon, the Department of Energy, the 
Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Others, including the 
Transportation Department, the Education Department and the Department of Commerce and the National 
Transportation Safety Board, told their workers they should comply. The New York Times (02/25, Shear, Conger), 
Forbes (02/25, Durkee), Politico (02/25, Stokol, Lippman), New York Post (02/25, Glebova), BBC (02/25, Faguy), 
Washington Examiner (02/25, Quarshie), Axios (02/25, Peck), Fox News (02/25, Stancy), New York Post (02/25, 
Keane), the Guardian (02/25, Tait), CNN (02/25, Treene), and Reuters (02/25, Alper, Layne, et al.) also reported on 
the story. 
FBI Atlanta Names New Special Agent in Charge 
WAGA (Fox-5) (02/25, Murray) reported that the FBI has named Paul W. Brown the Special Agent in Charge of the 
Atlanta Field Office. According to the article, Brown has decades of experience doing the job. He was in charge of 
the FBI's Mobile Field Office in Alabama. With the move, he'll lead more than 500 employees in Georgia, which 
spans 14 offices across the state. The article noted that before joining the FBI, Brown served as an officer in the 
U.S. Army and worked as a business consultant for a multinational professional services company. He graduated 
with his Bachelor's degree from Western Illinois University and an MBA from Tarleton State University in Texas. The 
Marietta Daily Journal (02/25, Staff Writer), and WRCB (NBC-3) (02/25, Howard) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: Los Angeles Activits Are Doxxing ICE Agents, As They Try to Break up Deportation 
Raids 
The New York Post (02/25, Taer, Downing) reported that activists in Los Angeles are posting the names, photos and 
personal information of ICE agents — and are warning neighborhoods about impending raids, federal sources said. 
As ICE ramps up deportation efforts of illegal migrants in Southern California, flyers with photos of agents' faces 
have appeared with claims that they "racially terrorize" local communities, agency sources said. The Department of 
Homeland Security was quick to hit back at the efforts of activists, saying they endangered the lives of law 
enforcement officers who are carrying out their duties. It's unknown who posted the flyers, but anti-ICE activists 
have hit the streets in force since an agency leak revealed plans for a citywide deportation blitz at the end of this 
month. Activists have been patrolling migrant neighborhoods on the lookout for ICE agents and warning locals of 
impending sweeps. Newsweek (02/25, Rahman) reported that an FBI LA spokesperson said, "The FBI safeguards 
constitutionally-protected rights, including freedom of speech and assembly. However, any individual who impedes 
law enforcement operations, potentially threatening the safety of law enforcement agents and subjects of their 
investigations, is subject to investigation and potential prosecution by the DOJ." ICE officials have vowed to
