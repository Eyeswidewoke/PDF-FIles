UBS Visa Debit Card for RMA or BSA 
Brokerage accounts with cash management features include the UBS Visa Debit Card 
(Card). If you choose this feature either verbally or in writing, you will be issued one or 
more Card(s) by the Card Issuer. UBS or the Card Issuer will complete any transactions you 
initiate using the Card(s). The Card Issuer will approve transactions up to your account's 
"Withdrawal Limit," as described in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. 
You agree to maintain sufficient available assets in your account to make payment in full, 
and transactions may be denied if there are insufficient assets in your account to make full 
payment for any Card transactions as they are processed. As your Card cash withdrawals 
are processed, we will deduct funds from your Account to reimburse the Card Issuer. Once 
each calendar month, we will deduct from your Account the amount of purchases made 
with the Card that have been received by the Card Issuer but not yet deducted from your 
Account. The Card Issuer may suspend or cancel Cards if there are insufficient assets to 
cover transactions. Your use of the Card constitutes your agreement to the terms and 
conditions in the UBS Visa Debit Card Cardholder Agreement, which is included in the 
Agreements and Disclosures booklet.
