conflicting territorial claims—as Secretary Kerry proposed =n his recent Asia travels—and probing North Korea's Kim 
Jong-Un for mo=e reliable undertakings than his father and grandfather ever produced. 
Recognition is wide=pread that the U.S. has over-relied on 'hard power' in recent years, a=d civilian policy tools—not 
having demonstrated comparable potency since=perhaps the 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended hostilities in Bosnia—
have lost stature and credibility compared to the =ilitary. Congressional funding has reflected the belief that DoD, alone 
am=ng cabinet departments, has the wherewithal to generate game-changing impa=t on security challenges overseas. A 
demonstration that geopolitical dealmaking is not a lost art in Washingt=n would be salutary on many levels. 
Is the US Up to the=Challenge? 
To say that success=could bring great benefits is not to predict it. Two impediments that Secr=tary Kerry has—justifiably, 
in the author's view—chosen to disregard=are, first, the perennial penchant of White House advisors to shield the 
President from political exposure to high-pro=ile endeavors carrying the risk of failure, and second, the potential 
that=congressional partisanship—ignoring the old 'water's edge' boundar=—could impede US negotiators' ability to 
deliver on a major agreement. 
The stakes in all t=ree of these arenas justify taking political risk, but as in military ende=vors, clarity about the long-term 
stakes for all concerned parties, and th= breadth of planning in support of negotiations, directly affect the prospects for 
success or failure. Here i= where doubts arise about the Administration's readiness to deliver on t=e promise of the 
diplomatic tracks it has so vigorously embraced.c/=> 
While each of these=negotiations is underway without undue controversy, questions are already =rising in the Syria and 
Iran tracks as to whether the US may be aiming too=low, preemptively limiting its objectives to what it believes could be 
agreed upon most easily, quickly and with the=least resistance from interested parties, including Congress. 
The benefits of nar=owly crafted agreements resulting in the dismantling of Syria's chemical=weapons and a monitored 
pullback of Iran's nuclear enrichment activities=would be deemed by many in the US as preferable to no agreement with 
a corresponding increased likelihood of resort to mil=tary force. For Syria, Russia and Iran, modest concessions would 
represent=a price worth paying if this meant the US would refrain from challenging t=eir larger, more strategic and 
longer-term objectives in the region. 
US negotiators, the=efore, could encounter surprisingly little pushback from Syria and Iran, r=spectively, and have 
Moscow's support, if the goals pursued are tightly =rawn and do not entail much if any political discomfiture for those 
parties. The one mystery emerging from this diploma=ic blitz is the Administration's own view of long-term US national 
inter=sts in the Middle East, and whether the current negotiations are aligned w=th a coherent strategy to pursue them. 
Israeli-Palestinian=Talks on Course, but what about the spoiler? 
Start with the trac= that is best-positioned: the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. US negotia=or Martin Indyk brings the 
expertise and the diplomatic and bureaucratic c=edentials necessary to hold his own in a negotiation where required 
compromises can be brokered only by mainta=ning the complete trust of the parties. Ambassador Indyk has assembled 
a q=ality team and kept a low media profile—all steps consistent with a prod=ctive negotiating approach. 
Unfortunately, neit=er party to the talks—Israeli or Palestinian Authority representatives=97has the capacity to address 
what has in recent years become the greatest=(if not the sole) source of insecurity in their midst, namely heavily armed 
nonstate actors equipped and funded by I=an. The range, accuracy and quantity of rocket and missile threats 
against=population centers in Israel from Hizballah across the Lebanese border and=Hamas in Gaza have steadily 
increased. 
Any confusion about=Israel's overriding security preoccupation should have been dispelled by=Prime Minister
