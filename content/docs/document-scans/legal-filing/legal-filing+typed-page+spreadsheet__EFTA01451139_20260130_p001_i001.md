FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
Theme #1: Holler for dollars 
• 
We expect the Fed and a recovery in US equity 
inflows to be the two main pillars of support for the 
dollar in 2014. Buy USD vs. NZD, CHF and SGD on 
cycle and extreme valuation. 
• 
The Euro-area current account remains supportive 
for the euro, but tight liquidity is fully priced, the 
risk of negative rates is material, portfolio inflows 
are peaking and we are reaching the 20% FX over-
valuation bound. Buy 12m EUR/USD 1.40/1.31 risk 
reversals for zero cost. 
Don't Rely on Fed Dovishness 
Last year was all about pricing out QE, even though 
tapering is just beginning. The overwhelming message 
is that the market front-runs major events, and that the 
timing of re-pricings is very unpredictable. Just as 2013 
was about QE unwinds and higher long-end yields, we 
think this year will be about the re-pricing of "low for 
long" and higher short-end yields. 
First, US short-end expectations are exceptionally 
benign. The market is not pricing the first rate hike until 
Q3 2015, just in line with FOMC projections, and by 
which time a simple linear extrapolation of the US 
unemployment rate takes us well below 6%. Second, 
the US yield curve is close to all-time steepness 
extremes. On the one hand, this means that the risks 
are skewed towards flattening, historically one of the 
most supportive yield curve environments (chart 1). On 
the other hand, the forwards are extremely high, 
suggesting that even if these are realized, the US dollar 
will climb up the carry ladder and drop-out of the 
bottom-3 yield ranking by year-end. 
Foreigners to Come Late to the Party 
The second building block to our bullish USD view is 
our positive outlook on growth and by extension US 
equity inflows. 2013 stood out for large dollar cash 
accumulation, on the back of UST liquidation and an 
adjustment of USD hedge ratios (chart 2). The year has 
also stood out for record outflows from US equities as 
Americans have invested large amounts offshore and 
foreigners have refused to engage in the S&P 500 rally. 
But looking at relative valuations, outflows have 
overshot what is a relatively benign valuation picture 
for US stocks. Using the average P/E ratio of Hong 
Kong and UK stocks as a global proxy, we find that 
valuations are close to the medium-term average (chart 
3). The odds therefore seem skewed towards higher 
equity inflows into the US, which combined with a 
flatter US curve should see an improvement in portfolio 
flows that was lagging this year.
