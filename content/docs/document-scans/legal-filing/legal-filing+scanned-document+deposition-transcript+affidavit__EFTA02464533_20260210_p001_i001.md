Lets start. =AO I am aware that you are currently angry at the world. . =AO me karp wechsler. all willing absorbers of 
the heat. (though you ,calling m= ,Debra , took away some of the the sting ) I am =orry to see you this way. 
emblematic ; I w=s asked to opine on whether to hire castrucci. an hour after I g=ve a preliminary yes. . I called you 
then texted you that = had thought more about it and changed my mind. The next day b=ad called and asked for my 
vote. I told him ,in no uncertain t=rms it is a no , I categorically vote no. =AO I called you . you came to see me . I 
sai= it was a bad idea. you said you were going to do it anyway , = said and followed up in writing IT IS A MISTAKE . and 
added =lease don't come back to me with anything suggesting otherwise ,=you and I should be clear I think it is wrong 
. A very strong NO .=C2 you of course can hire whomever you like. 
e=rly on I told you I thought Tom remarkably careless . Eillenn goofy and your art I=wyer not well informed to say the 
least. you told me Tom was a senio= partner. Eileen had headed the trading desk, and your art guy wrote the =ook. I 
said I thought you deserved better ,should get better p=ople and no , I am not an HR person. yesterday you told me 
that the =eason you have hired whatever available was to avoid being dependent on me= ( by far , not the best place to 
save money ) 
Joslin who you =say I hired . I did not find With a two person given choice I=approved josli= over some woman that 
eileen preferred. against my repeated advice=C2 you and =ileen decided to pay only under 300k . I told you at t=at 
time that I would personally pay the difference for higher =uality. that was years ago . I have sent over a 
hundred=emails to you clearly saying he needs to be managed by professionals= initially , that referred to Eillen and 
Ada.and after, =rad. john etc. THere are 
at least a few emails each and every =onth from me, telling you , he is 
slipping failing cracking =AO fragile. . crazy, nuts, heading towards incompetence. Unless YOU =AKE ACTION! when I 
pressured him for accurate numbers , you t=ld him, to tell me, that he works for you and NOT for me.. When I 
c=ntinued to press for accuracty from your office , you told me that the= were now all afraid of me and i should let 
brad communicate any req=ests, ( you now tell me " we know what Brad is"?). When I told y=u you office needs to be 
reviewed and changed you told me i was bein= destructive rather than constructive. when i ultimately conf=onted 
joslin<bpan>, in an attempt to protect you, told him that his numbers were w=ldly inaccurate , you told me that i had 
caused his ultimate resignarion and now have an affirmative obligation to help. 
=/div> 
I did give you a bad number, and apologized as soon as i r=alized it. an error that was an embarrassment for me, t=e 
fact that that the accurate number is still way below what you agr=ed to pay , has fallen by the wayside.( the 
preposterous argument th=t the end of year transaction was Alans idea , which you now know was not tr=e and that me 
not receiving Phaidon documents was unexplainable. was your ju=tification for non - full payment ) 
Hopefully You =ill recall that when you initially asked for my help. I declined rep=atedly with the admonition that that 
having a financial arrangement may =AO jeopardize our friendship (as you will be unhappy paying what you=will view as 
a large sum. while choosing to ignore the financ=al benefits, ). In Bedford , I repeated my concern. It is distressing to 
me=, I have done my utmost to keep you safe. =AO and will continue to do so. reckles choices in accounting or 
otherwise do=s not bode well. at each turn I have put your interests first many t=mes including fighting your choices.
