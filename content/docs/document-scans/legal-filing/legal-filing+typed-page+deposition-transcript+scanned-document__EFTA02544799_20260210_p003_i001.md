a way to investigate the questions of fact and come to some conclusions that we could all accept. <=ont size="2" 
face="Arial"> 
Short of being able to talk to you openly, it's very important to the t=ree of us to protect you from future 
financial catastrophe. We have been trying our best to do this, and will continue to try, regardless of what happens with 
our communication. We believe that Eric Menoyo designed your estate plan properly to protect the interests of all 
parties, and we will continue to work to ensure that the plan is administered in a faith=ul and professional way. 
We also wanted to say that we have a different interpretation of how we have balanced respect, privacy, and 
autonomy, versus questions and interfer=nce, in our family history. You tell us that you deeply resent being asked 
quest=ons when you request financial withdrawals, and you deeply resent our questions about your financial situation. 
You say that you are the only one being questioned in this way. But we don't believe that's the case. Histo=ically, as a 
family we have been open with each other about our individual financia= situations; we have watched out for each 
other and stepped in if we felt it was needed; and on the most concrete level, any request to access funds from any of 
the trusts has always required an explanation to go along with it. 
In Avi's case, you and Mommoy interfered to tell her that something=was going very wrong with Sandi and that 
she had to get professional help; to practically force her to go meet with a lawyer Mommoy found for her when she 
became convinced that Avi's marriage to Jon was causing harm; and to order Avi to go see a doctor and get on 
medication when she confesse= that she couldn't handle things. That is: when Mommoy s=w Avi doing fine, she didn't 
pry or interfere. When she saw her=falling apart, she stepped in to help. 
In Diane's case, she discussed her financial situation with Mommoy =n a very open way on many, many 
occasions, leading Mommoy to offer her things like washing machines (we all know how that turned out) and more 
significan=ly, help with rent payments during a few years in Mexico, during a period when: Oxfam had stopped paying 
the rent, Gmo had stopped receiving his stipend as a grad student, and Diane was still suffering from a considerabl= 
salary cut imposed by Oxfam after the move to Mexico. Diane accepted her offer, which was a huge temporary help 
while she got herself back on her feet. 
Furthermore, on the occasions when Diane has asked Bainco for money from the trust that is in her name, she is 
always asked to explain exactly what it is for. This happens even though the amounts have never been very large. If 
anything looks odd, the trustees come back to her with questions. Harry once even phoned her because what she was 
asking for seemed so strange and he was concerned that something was wrong (in case you are wondering what was 
indeed going on, it was a small Mexican peso loan to a friend in trouble, which Diane couldn't do by other means 
because she was trav=ling at the time, and it couldn't wait until she got back home). Diane has n=t found this 
questioning to be humiliating or prying - she assumes it is the terms of the trust and the trustees are just doing their 
jobs. 
In Harry's case, at one point in the mid-1990s he unexpectedly owed $60=000 due to the Alternative Minimum 
Tax as a result of receiving stock options.=C2 He discussed this with Mommoy and her accountant, and they decided she 
would lend him the money to pay the taxes and he would pay her back once he had a chance to exercise and liquidate 
the stock options, several months later. 
In the current situation, the reason we are asking you questions now (and never before) is that now we are 
hearing from you repeatedly that your financial situation is dire. We decided to ask you about your financi=l 
circumstances - not lightly, as we said in one of our many emails, but after much thought, given that we could see that 
your concern about it was causing you a great deal of stress and was leading to you taking import=nt and possibly 
unnecessarily radical decisions. We continue to feel that you are misinterpreting your financial situation, and that this is 
causing you considerable anguish. It pains us greatly to see this, as we've sai= before. 
We can tell from your tax requests that you have been spending many hundred= of thousands of dollars every 
year on personal expenses, even after having successfully eliminated the extra costs that you have mentioned as a drain
