44 Misc. 3d 280, *; 982 N.Y.S.2d 868, **; 
2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1404, ***; 2014 NY Slip Op 24083 
On September 11, 2013, plaintiffs moved for leave to serve an amended summons and 
second amended verified complaint. Plaintiffs sought to amend the summons and first 
amended complaint to delete the McRory defendants from the caption and to remove the 
cause of action asserted as against them to reflect their voluntary discontinuance of all 
claims against them. Plaintiffs further sought to amend the first amended complaint in 
order to limit it to direct claims against 2784 LLC and Burns solely for wrongfully 
withholding from them over $80,000 in distributions due to them from the net sale 
proceeds from the 2784 premises. 
Plaintiffs' second amended verified complaint (annexed as exhibit A to plaintiffs' motion 
papers in motion sequence No. 2) alleges that Neary is a member of 2784 LLC, having a 
6.133% ownership interest therein. It further alleges that Benevento has a 9.2% beneficial 
interest in 2784 LLC through the estate of Julia, who was a member of 2784 LLC, r**121 
having an 18.4% ownership interest therein, and that Benevento was and is the co-
executor of the estate of Julia and is entitled to 50% of Julia's estate. 
Plaintiffs' second amended complaint sets forth that on January 20, 2010, 2784 LLC, 
under the sole and exclusive management of Burns, sold the 2784 premises to M & A 
Realty Services, LLC for the sum of $1,050,000. It alleges that as of r28Eq January 22, 
2010, the sum of $544,018.29 was available for distribution to 2784 LLC members from 
the net proceeds of the sale of the 2784 premises, and that, as of March [*874] 9, 2010, 
distributions of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2784 premises were made to 2784 
LLC members, including distributions paid directly to Neary and Benevento, as members. 
It asserts that Burns, in breach of independent fiduciary duties he owed to Neary and 
Benevento in their own, individual capacities, unilaterally and wrongfully withheld from 
them their fair share of distributions due to them from the net proceeds of this sale in 
violation of the operating agreement and applicable Limited Liability Company Law. 
Specifically, it alleges that Burns withheld from these sale proceeds the sum of $35,745.83 
from Neary and the ["'13] sum of $44,831.58 from Benevento. 
Plaintiffs' second amended complaint alleges three causes of action. Plaintiffs' first cause 
of action against 2784 LLC alleges that 2784 LLC is in possession and control of the funds 
wrongfully withheld from them by Burns from their share of distributions of the net sale 
proceeds of the 2784 premises in violation of the operating agreement and applicable law, 
and that they have been damaged in the total sum of $80,577.41, plus interest from March 
9, 2010. Plaintiffs' second cause of action alleges a direct claim by Neary against Burns, 
which asserts that Burns owed an independent fiduciary duty to Neary, as a member of 
2784 LLC with a 6.133% ownership interest, that Burns wrongfully withheld the sum of 
$35,745.83 from his share of distributions from the net proceeds of the sale of the 2784 
premises, and that he is entitled to a judgment in this sum. Plaintiffs' third cause of action 
alleges a direct claim by Benevento against Burns, which asserts that Burns owed an 
independent fiduciary duty to Benevento as a member of 2784 LLC with a 9.2% ownership 
interest and/or as the holder of a 9.2% beneficial interest in 2784 LLC through the estate of 
Julia, that [—la] Burns wrongfully withheld the sum of $44,831.58 from his share of 
distributions from the net proceeds of the sale of the 2784 premises, and that he is entitled 
to a judgment in this sum.
