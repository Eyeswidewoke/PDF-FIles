or openly in those of others. 
In addition to adults with similar interests, offenders can sometimes get 
validation from the children they communicate with online. Children needing 
attention and affection may respond to an offender in positive ways. They may 
tell the offender he is a "great guy" and that they are grateful for his interest in 
them. They appreciate the fact that he is willing to listen to and nonjudgmentally 
discuss sex with them. In communicating with children, and in a few cases with 
adults, offenders can easily assume the identities of other adults and one or more 
children. 
Validation is also obtained from the fact that they are 
utilizing the same cuffing-edge technology used by the most 
intelligent and creative people in society. In their minds the 
time, technology, and talent it takes to engage in this activ-
ity is proof of its value and legitimacy. Because of this 
validation process and the fueling of sexual fantasy with 
online pornography, I believe that some individuals with 
potentially illegal, but previously latent sexual preferences 
have begun to criminally "act out." Their inhibitions are 
weakened after their arousal patterns are fueled and vali-
dated through online computer communication. This does 
not in any way suggest we should blame the computer and 
that offenders are not legally accountable for their behavior. 
As previously stated offenders' need forvalidation is the 
foundation on which proactive investigative techniques (e.g., 
stings, undercover operations) are built and the primary 
reason they work so often. Although their brains may tell 
them not to send child pornography or reveal details of past 
or planned criminal acts to a stranger they met online, their 
need for validation and to fulfill their sexual fantasies often 
compels them to do so.

Maintenance of Business Records 
Offenders who have turned their child pornography into a profit-making busi-
ness use computers the same way any business uses them. Things such as lists of 
customers, dollar amounts of transactions, descriptions of inventory can all be 
recorded. on the computer. Because trafficking in child pornography by 
computer lowers the risks, there has been an increase in profit-motivated 
distribution. 
Child Pornography 
An offender can use a computer to transfer, manipulate, and even create child 
pornography. With the typical iffirne computer and modem, still images can eas-
ily be digitally stored, transferred from print or videotape, and transmitted with 
each copy being as good as the original. Visual images can be stored on hard 
drives, floppy disks, CD-ROMs, or DVDs. With newer technology, faster 
modems, digital cameras, and more powerful computers, similar things can now 
be done with moving images. Increasingly available, high-speed Internet connec-
