determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial 
community. such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to 
independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from 
an independent accounting firm or an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA. with 
respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated 
industries in connection with ow initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will 
have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, 
81 
although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check 
company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more 
of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient 
for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or 
acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such 
business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for 
purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible 
merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination. 
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially 
unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such 
company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target 
business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or asses all significant risk factors. 
The time requital to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business 
combination, and the costs associated with this process, arc not currently ascertainable with any degree of 
certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with 
which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the 
funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
We may pay a member of our combined team (or an entity affiliated with a member of our combined team) a 
fee for financial advisory services rendered in connection with our identification, negotiation and consummation 
of our initial business combination. The foe will only be payable upon closing of our initial business combination, 
and may be paid out of the offering proceeds deposited in the trust account. The per-share amount distributed to 
any redeeming stockholders upon thc completion of our initial business combination will not be reduced as a 
result of such fee. A majority of disinterested directors will determine the nature and amount of such fee, which 
will be based upon the prevailing market rate for similar services negotiated at aims' length for such transactions 
at such time, but will in no event exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate. Any such fee will also be subject to the 
review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee's policies and procedures relating to transactions 
that may present conflicts of interest. No such fee will be payable to our Chief Executive Officer. 
Lack of business diversification 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our 
success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the 
resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that 
we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of 
business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity. our lack of diversification may: 
• subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a 
substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business 
combination, and 
• cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
Limited ability to evaluate the target's management team 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating 
the desirability of effecting our business combination with that businew, our assessment of the target business's 
management may not prove to be correct, In addition, the 
82 
future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. 
Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently 
be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some 
capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to 
our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our 
management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target
