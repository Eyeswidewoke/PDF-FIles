half-circular space called the apse. You might find separate chapels opening off (or "radiating from") the walkway or 
ambulatory that follows the outside perimeter of the apse. 
The chevet at the Abbey of Saint-Denis (1144) is a recursive structure. Its half-circular perimeter is defined not by a 
simple curved line but by a series of scoops, each a radiating chapel--and itself (roughly) a half-circle. In other 
words, this chevet is a semi-circle of semi-circles. 
Many chevets have approximately this shape--in which each chapel "becomes a paraphrase of the apse itself,* as 
John Summerson puts it. But Saint-Denis realizes the idea in its purest form--appropriately; Gothic architecture first 
emerged at Saint-Denis in this very chevet, and nearby parts of the building. 
The inside of the west or front facade at Reims Cathedral, probably designed in the 1220s, is one of the most 
celebrated compositions in medieval art. In a large pointed arch a rose window is lodged at the top like a helium 
balloon. Within this large arch, and below the rose, is a second, smaller arch with a smaller rose lodged at its top. 
Thus, another recursive structure: an arch with a rose and, nested within it, a smaller arch with a smaller rose. 
The west wall at Reims seems perfectly natural and is. but its recursive structure solves a tricky problem. It's often 
difficult to design a satisfactory composition based on two of something. (Try arranging exactly two flowers in a vase 
in a non-ridiculous-looking fashion. It can't be done.) The large majority of Gothic west facades have one rose or 
none, but recursive structure allows Reims to have two, and the effect is spectacular. 
The Gothic cathedral of Chartres, begun in 1194, established the classical or "high Gothic" style and is, as such, 
one of history's most beautiful, influential, and surprising buildings. Remarkably enough, the Gothic cathedral of 
Bourges, begun in 1195, is in many ways just as beautiful and surprising, although radically different. Bourges 
inspired its own small group of important buildings, including Beauvais Cathedral and the east end of Le Mans. 
Many classical Gothic cathedrals have a lower level or story (the aisles and arcades), a medium level (the triforium), 
and an upper level (the clerestory). Entering at the front of Chartres, and finding yourself in the nave, you see the 
large windows of the clerestory along the upper level of the nave walls to your left and right; beneath them, the 
triforium is a dark, windowless band; below the triforium, aisles at ground level on each side, separated from the 
nave by arcades. The aisle ceilings are much lower than the nave. 
At Bourges, this design undergoes a startling recursive revision. Imagine the nave cut in half down the middle, front 
to back. Pull the two halves apart. Insert a whole second church in the gap, telescoping upward from the newly 
opened slot (or popping out like a triumphant slice of Gothic toast). Now there is a second clerestory at the very top; 
below that, a second triforium; below that, a second set of arcades, left and right--each tremendously tall because 
each spans the whole vertical space from the bottom of the new triforium to the floor. The result is a space that 
builds in a jubilant crescendo towards the center, from the low outer aisles to the tall inner aisles to the enormous 
volume of the nave in the middle. 
One of the most important aspects of mature Gothic design, and one that takes us right into the presence of the 
Gothic mind, is tracery--the thin, curvy, carved stone partitions that separate one window into many regions, or 
decorate blank wall surfaces. (The tracery within each window forms a structurally independent whole, separate 
from the window frame.) Tracery windows were a technical advance over earlier "composite windows," where a 
group of holes punched in stone panels yielded a set of related forms. 
Tracery is central to Gothic because the medieval artist cared, above all, for design, not representation; his first goal 
was to create beautiful lines, surfaces, and volumes, not the painted or sculpted illusion of three-dimensional space. 
So medieval art is design art, and design begins with drawing--and tracery is pure drawing, abstract drawing 
representing nothing but itself; drawing in stone. Many later Gothic buildings use tracery not merely within windows 
and on wall surfaces but as a free-standing element of an architectural composition. 
Recursion is basic to the art of tracery. Tracery was invented at Reims in around 1210 and used soon after at 
Amiens, the last (with Chartres and Reims) of the triumvirate on which the high Gothic style is based. To move from 
the characteristic tracery design of Reims to that of Amiens, simply add one level of recursion: at Reims, an arch
