lighthearted boasting, whimsy, exaggeration, and "bluster" are, as a matter of law, not 
misleading, because reasonable people do not take such speech seriously. The problem is 
that human beings are in fact often influenced by discourse that the law calls "mere" 
puffery. ^2' There are two lines of evidence for this. The first is social scientific inquiry, 
which has demonstrated in controlled experimental settings the influence of puffery. -re The 
second line of evidence is the market practice r2011 [*202] of profit-maximizing 
corporations which spend billions of dollars per year on advertising and promotional 
campaigns which often contain nothing but puffery. "4  Where firms are operating in 
competitive markets, corporations that engage in puffery would be quickly subsumed by 
those who did not waste precious resources on such efforts, if it were as inconsequential 
as the law takes it to be.
Corporate law scholars at times appear to believe that loose discursive standards for 
corporate speech directed at consumers is a necessary correlate to the command that 
firms pursue profits for shareholders. In a remarkable article on the problem of "half-truths" 
in corporate speech, Donald Langevoort argues that whether a "half-truth" should give rise 
to a shareholder cause of action for securities fraud depends on to whom the "half-truth" 
was directed. N, If a firm tells a "half-truth" about the quality of its products, but directs the 
statement to consumers rather than shareholders, then shareholders should not have a 
cause of action. The reason for this, according to Langevoort, is that shareholders stand to 
gain from such half-truths being spoken to consumers, and therefore the shareholders 
should have no complaint about them. It is expected that directors will exaggerate the 
firm's strengths when dealing with non-shareholders p203] because this will make it 
easier for them to get better deals for shareholders: "Company executives have a strong 
incentive to style general corporate publicity to conform to a desirable image . . that 
image-making is said to be necessary to capture desired resources for the firm from 
among a broad array of constituents, both internal and external." 
And therefore, 
"expressions of optimism should not be actionable in those settings where hype is most 
commonplace: the kinds of statements made with customer and employee audiences 
largely in mind." "3  If I understand Langevoort correctly, his point is that "half-truths" should 
not be actionable precisely because they can influence non-shareholders in a manner 
beneficial to shareholders. It thus appears that what is part of the solution for shareholders 
is part of the problem for non-shareholders. 
b. Pushing Past the Pareto Fallacy of Corporate Profitability 
Conversations about corporate governance and the relationship between various 
stakeholders in corporate enterprise sometimes degenerate into what I call "the Pareto 
fallacy of corporate profitability." "4  The fallacy is the view that, in the end, boards of 
directors will always maximize profits for shareholders if they make decisions that are also 
in the best interest of workers, consumers, and the community at-large. The fallacy 
assumes that worker-friendly decisions will attract and retain the best workers, and 
consumer friendly decisions will attract and retain the most loyal consumers, thereby 
ensuring maximum returns to shareholders. Under this view, there is no conflict between 
shareholder interests and stakeholder interests, so long as corporate boards sufficiently 
seize the synergies available to them. ^'5 p2041
