This is useful. Transcript of govt briefing of journos 
DUBAI, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi has bailed out neighbouring Dubai with $10 billion in surprise 
aid for debt-laden Dubai World [DBWLD.UL), which said it would use $4.1 billion of it to repay its 
Nakheel unit's Islamic bond maturing on Monday. [ID:nLDE5BD0FV] 
Dubai's government held a conference call on Monday to discuss the deal with a government source 
taking questions. 
Following is a transcript of the key points made by the source, who declined to give his name: 
IS THIS A BAILOUT? 
Abu Dhabi and Dubai are clearly working as partners here to find a good, fair solution to the Dubai 
World situation. The key part is buying time to allow Dubai World and creditors the opportunity to 
come together on consensual restructuring. 
There are no conditions. This is a government-to-government fund, the terms of that fund are internal 
to the government ofAbu Dhabi and Dubai. These funds are specifically for Dubai World. 
I won't go into specifics. There is no conditionality. Abu Dhabi has made it clear it is there to 
support Dubai, Dubai World and I won't go into specifics of how the money is being handed. What's 
important is we have two partners that will help each other and help the UAE (United Arab Emirates). 
BANKRUPTCY LAW 
The government of Dubai has been in consultation for some time with bankruptcy professionals and 
international judges to develop a framework that is transparent, fair and acceptable to all parties. The 
current UAE bankruptcy laws are largely untested and (their) administration by Dubai courts poses 
certain challenges and problems for a large and complex bankruptcy of this size. These (new) laws 
should allow Dubai World, should it choose it to use the laws to achieve its restructuring and 
remaining obligations should it not find a consensual restructuring with its creditors. 
The decree (for the new laws) was signed last night and will be announced later today. 
To the extent it is unable to reach a consensual restructuring with lenders, the government wanted to 
make sure there was a fair and equitable way for it to restructure its debt. If it doesn't work, we wanted 
to make sure there was a fair and equitable framework to restructure its debt. I won't say it won't file or 
will file (for bankruptcy), but we wanted to make sure the company has the protection it needs if it 
goes to the courts. 
DUBAI WORLD ASSET SALES 
It is premature to speculate on the outcome of the reorganisation process. All options will be assessed 
and all options have been discussed between the government of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The plan will 
be developed in consultation with all stakeholders and probably could include the sale of assets. That 
will be something agreed to by everybody involved. 
Dubai has not given anything up and there are no conditions on the money. Abu Dhabiprovided the 
money to support Dubai and support Dubai World because it believes it's in the long-term strategy 
of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and the UAE. 
This is specifically for Dubai World and the affected assets, which were talked about in earlier press 
releases. It's not meant to include any other assets. It does not include the ports, Jebel Ali Free Zone 
Authority. All the things that were talked about that were unaffected remain unaffected and will not be 
affected in any way.
