chooses the moment when spontaneous growth invo=ves all the elements usually found in a garden: trees, shrubs, 
vines, bulbs, grasses=— even wild roses. The gardener's role then is to guide and enrich in sym=athy with natural 
process, integrating accidents like fallen trees. Clement use= no chemicals, no supplemental watering and no noisy, 
energy-wasting machinery= But he does prune: A self-sown willow is trimmed to show off its multiple trun=s; wild 
hornbeams are clipped into smooth domes; a path uphill meanders throu=h the heart of a sprawling smokebush 
(Cotinus obovatus). Most paths are=20 simply mown grass, their routing changing from year to year to preserve self-
sown clumps of foxglove, verbascum or hogweed, which draws many inter=sting insects. "A garden is always artificial," 
he insists, =80 but home gardens can become wildlife preserves." 
Movement, as he sees it, involves seasonal variation and change=due to self-sowing and species migration. Moving 
gardens, lived in or visited, ar= never purely visual but very tactile — you kneel, lie down, rub ag=inst, smell, inhale. "My 
gardens are meant to be brushed against," writ=s Clement. His first book devoted to the Moving Garden has been 
reprinted five times. 
In the late '80s and '90s, Clement worked on mainl= public projects such as a main section of the Parc Andre-Citroen in 
Paris (with landscape=designer Alain Provost and architects Patrick Berger, Jean-Francois Jodry and Jean-Paul=20 
Viguier), the Valloires Abbey gardens (Les Jardins de Valloires) in Picard=, the Jardins de la Grande Arche de la Defense in 
Paris, the Henri Matisse=Park in Lille, gardens of the Chateau de Blois and the Mediterranean Gardens (Le=Jardin des 
Moditerranees) of the Domaine du Rayol. His most influential=work internationally has perhaps been his part of the Parc 
Andre-Citro =ABn. It includes a Moving Garden managed by the park staff: It is they who decide wher= the paths will be 
mown from year to year, to respect self-sown plants. Nearby,=his color-themed gardens have a complex symbolism, 
which visitors might sense=even if uninformed. Mothers report that when they enter the Green Garden,=linked to the 
theme of silence, their children often stop talking. 
In 1997, Piet Oudolf, Henk Gerritsen and Michael King commented on thes= gardens (in Nieuwe bloemen, nieuwe 
tuinen): "Gilles CI =A9ment's triumph at Parc Andre-Citroen demonstrates the range of possibilities th= art of gardening 
offers for both self-expression and communication. He has shown=how ideas may be presented both on the grand scale 
and in the tiniest detail,=making his approach as relevant to the private gardener as it should be to the br=ader world of 
the landscape architect." 
Clement refuses the romantic idea of an artist's signature= but his public projects have common elements: He often 
links separate spaces — fo=mally, as at Citroen or informally, like clearings in a forest — each with=its own character. 
Connecting paths are meandering and multidirectional. Where he includes a=single long axis (at Le Grande Arche de la 
Defense in the Domaine du Rayol),=it never dominates in the sense of imposing a hierarchy and reveals little of the=20 
mysteries on either side, easily accessed from the long line but invisible=until you happen right upon it. He sometimes 
uses geometric shapes, especially=around historic monuments or where symbolism is suggested, but this formality is=20 
open-ended, almost subversive in its unpredictability. His rejection of hierarchy, in garden design as in life, is almost 
obsessive. For several=years running, Clement refused the French national prize for landscape arch=tecture, insisting it 
should be given to the anonymous farmers, engineers and fores=ers who are the real architects of the landscape. In 
1999, the prize was besto=ed on him without his consent. 
Clement calls the Moving Garden a conceptual tool. His second one,=the Planetary Garden, emerged after he had seen 
the first photographs of Earth=from space. He imagined extending the confines — and care — lav=shed on home 
gardens to the whole globe. In 2000, Clement directed a major science exhibit=in Paris to explain and provide positive 
examples of this theme. He also took a sta=ce on species migrations similar to that of American writer Michael Pollan, 
whic= has not always made him popular in the scientific community. "The main=objective," writes Clement, "is to 
encourage biological diversity, a sour=e of wonder and our guarantee for the future." 
For the past few years, Clement has been developing another concep=, which he calls "landscapes of the Third Kind." A 
study of highly ma=aged farm and forest land south of Paris led him to seek out hidden spaces that escape monocult=re 
and are forgotten by human industry, in-between spaces often abandoned aft=r misuse, still capable of spontaneous
