Global Economic Perspectives: China's evolving FX policy 
Our colleagues Zhiwei Zhang and Li Zeng recently offered at least a partial 
explanation. We have for years emphasized that one needs to consider Asian 
exports from the perspective of regional production networks. An emerging 
literature demonstrates that exchange rate elasticities for exports are lower the 
more integrated countries are in supply chains. Zhiwei and Li re-calculated 
China's real effective exchange rate adjusting the weights for the importance 
of export processing. 
Chinese exports benefit from a depreciation of the 
Korean won, for example, to the extent that they embody imported 
components from South Korea. Recalculating the REER to incorporate such 
supply chain effects, they find that China's real effective exchange rate 
appreciated only 19% between 2010 and 2015 - and hardly at all for its high-
tech export sectors - which is much less than the 31% appreciation of the BIS' 
conventional export-weighted REER. 
Many exporters, of course, would welcome a depreciation and it may be that 
as the proprietor of the final stages of many regional production networks 
China's exchange rate versus the USD and EUR may be more important to 
regional export growth than that of South Korea or Taiwan, for example. But 
with a record trade surplus of USD602bn last year and rising we don't see a 
competitiveness-based need for a weaker currency. 
What do we expect from here? 
That doesn't mean we don't see the currency continuing to depreciate. Zhiwei 
Zhang expects the exchange rate to reach 7.01USD this year and our FX 
strategist Perry Kojodjojo thinks that could come earlier rather than later. A 
simple interest-rate based argument - the Fed expected to raise rates three 
times this year and China expected to cut twice - suggests 7.0 is a very 
plausible forecast.

But the pace of depreciation need not be as rapid as it has been. With an 
evolving strategy for managing the exchange rate the authorities have both 
surprised and confused investors. It is not clear what their intentions are 
beyond continuing to allow more flexibility in the exchange rate. Nor should 
investors expect perfect clarity - few countries that don't have fixed exchange 
rates are perfectly transparent. 
So investors and policymakers will both 
continue to learn how this new regime works. As capital outflows hopefully 
subside - and we think it's reasonable to expect they will -- there would be less 
pressure on the currency to depreciate.

Adjusting for supply chain 
influences, China's real 
exchange rate has 
appreciated far less than 
conventional measures 
suggest. 
We still expect further RMB 
deprecation, just hopefully 
less rapid than in recent 
weeks.
