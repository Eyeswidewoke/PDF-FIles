An Interview with Jeffrey Epstein 
Page 4 of 5 
destruction. 
Last week, one of my associates questioned a Muslim foreigner as to whether he or 
his 'brothers" could be trusted. In response, the man emphatically stated "NEVER" 
adding 'that they are taught to be great neighbors and obey the laws of the 
countries in which they reside until they are called up. Then, they will slice your 
throats as easily as they came to your BBQ's" 
NCC: If the goal of the symposiums sponsored by The People's Truth Forum is to 
further efforts against terrorism and enhance our security, why would anyone 
oppose your efforts? 
Our country is divided and many amongst us refuse to recognize the existence of 
evil. Naïve ideologues contend that Islamic "freedom fighters" are lashing out at the 
West • and especially Americans - because of the provocative nature of Western life 
or the Western presence in Islamic States. To hold these contentions is to be blind to 
the truth either through ignorance or deliberate oversight. 
NCC: Are those who hamper our security not complicit in our danger? 
If we choose to ignore the facts as presented - that radical Islamists are waging war 
against the free West and especially the United States of America - then future 
deaths at the hands of terrorists must find the blood of the slaughtered on our hands 
as well. 
NCC: What should America do to protect ourselves against Islamic terrorism? 
All efforts must be made to reverse the tide. Muslims, of questionable repute -
meaning having known ties to terrorism, have infiltrated various institutions across 
America. They have gained access to the highest levels of government and are 
exerting influence on policy making in Washington. These people must be exposed 
and incarcerated. Additionally, our politicians must be held accountable for their 
actions as well. 
NCC: What can our readers do to help you and The People's Truth Forum In your 
efforts to make America safer? How can we help get those ads on the air? 
Time is not on our side with respect tO CBS's questionable behavior. At this Juncture, 
trying to convince them to run the commercials would waste valuable energy and 
resources. However, I am committed to publicizing the matter in hopes of waking up 
the American people to CBS's dubious agenda. 
Most importantly, everyone should immediately make reservations to attend the 
symposium and encourage their associates and relatives to do likewise. If you can't 
make it, please consider donating toward the event. Contributions received will 
benefit law enforcement officers and others through reduced ticket prices. 
Clearly, time is of the essence for the security and well-being of the greatest nation 
on earth is at stake. 
Reservation forms are available on our website: www.peoplestruthforum.com 
Again, thank you Mr. Epstein. Daily, Americans must choose between vigilance and 
complacency; you are doing a great service in educating us about the threats to our 
nation and way of life. Keep up the good work.
