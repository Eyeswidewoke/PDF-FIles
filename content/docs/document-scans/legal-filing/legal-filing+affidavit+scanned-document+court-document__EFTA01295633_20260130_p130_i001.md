2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
substantial and valuable improvements, referable to the contract." Id. The burden is on the 
party asserting the part performance to show acts "unequivocally referring to, and resulting 
from, [an alleged) agreement." Fried! v. Benson, 25 Wn. App. 381, 609 P.2d 449, 455 
(Wash. Ct. App. 1980). 
Mr. Steadman's only evidence of part performance is that he made payments in the 
modified amount r28] to BoA for eight months after the contract modification allegedly 
occurred, and BoA accepted those payments. (Steadman Decl. at 3; Steadman Dep. at 
116:11-16.) However, the Washington Supreme court has held that, of the three factors, 
"consideration alone is insufficient evidence of part performance to take [a contract] out of 
the statute of frauds." Berg, 886 P.2d at 571. More important, the court cannot say that 
BoA's performance does not "leave no doubt as to the . . . existence of the contract." See 
id. BoA notified Mr. Steadman twice after he began making modified payments that the 
payments were insufficient, and he was in danger of defaulting. (Ford Decl. Ex. 2 at 78-88, 
95-96; Steadman Dep. at 116:18-117:8,135:16-25.) BoA also specified that, by accepting 
lower payments, BoA did not waive its right to full payment." (Ford Decl. Ex. 2 at 87-88.) 
Because the acts allegedly constituting part performance do not "point unmistakably and 
exclusively to the existence of the claimed agreement," the statute of frauds applies. See 
Miller v. McCamish, 78 Wn.2d 821, 479 P.2d 919, 922 (Wash. 1971). 
8 Mr. Steadman claims that BoA representatives told him to disregard the notices of default because his modification had been 
approved, and he was only receiving the notices because p29) their system was behind in formally processing the approval. 
(Steadman Dep. at 113:13-117:11; Steadman Decl. at 2-3.) However, these out•ofcotrt statements are not admissible to prove 
the truth of the matter asserted. Fed. ft Evid. 801(c), 802. Mr. Steadman has not established that any hearsay exception 
applies. Therefore, Mr. Steadman cannot rely on these statements to show that his modification had in tact been approved. 
The final question, then, is whether Green Tree may assert the statute of frauds defense in 
this action. It is well-established that an "assignee steps into the shoes of the assignor, 
and has all of the rights of the assignor." Mut. of Enumclaw Ins. Co. v. USF Ins. Co., 164 
Wn.2d 411, 191 P.3d 866, 874-75 (Wash. 2008); Fed. Fin. Co., 949 P.2d at 417 ("[A]n 
assignee's rights are coextensive with those of the assignor at the time of assignment."). 
By corollary, "an assignee takes subject to defenses assertible against the assignor." Mut. 
of Enumclaw Ins. Co., 191 P.3d at 875, n.10 (quoting Lonsdale v. Chesterfield, 99 Wn.2d 
353, 662 P.2d 385, 389 (Wash. 1983)). As such, Green Tree can only enforce the loan 
terms to the same extent as BoA was able to at the time of the assignment. 
The Washington Supreme Court has held that "[a] party who promises, implicitly or 
explicitly, to make a memorandum of a contract in order to satisfy the statute of frauds, and 
then breaks that promise, is estopped to interpose the statute as a defense r3O] to the 
enforcement of the contract by another who relied on it to his detriment." Klinke v. Famous 
Recipe Fried Chicken, Inc., 94 Wn.2d 255, 616 P.2d 644, 647 (Wash. 1980); see also Lige 
Dickson Co. v. Union Oil Co. of Calif, 96 Wn.2d 291, 635 P.2d 103, 105 (Wash. 1981) 
([D]efendant's failure to reduce the agreement with plaintiff to a writing, and plaintiff's 
reliance on such promise, estopped defendant from asserting the statute of frauds as a 
defense.") The court concludes that a genuine question of material fact exists as to 
whether BoA implicitly promised Mr. Steadman that it would sign the loan modification
