This material has been prepared for discussion purposes only and is not mended to be an offer or solicitation, or the basis for any contract to purchase or sell any 
security, or other instrument, or for Deutsche Bank to enter into or arrange any type of transaction as a consequence of any information contained herein. 
Structured products are not suitable for all 'masters. Terms quoted above are indicative only and subject to change. Please refer to the Term Sheet or 
Prospectus and consider carefully before investing. 
Structured Investments may entail certain risks, and consideration should be given to the following: Liquidity Risk — A 
secondary market is not guaranteed and may be limited. The issuer may make a secondary market and provide clients 
with liquidity, but is under no obligation to repurchase the securities from the client. Further, issuers may offer pricing on 
secondary transactions at a significant discount to the client's initial investment amount; Callable Features - Structured 
Products may be callable by the issuer prior to the stated maturity date. If called, the amount payable to investors may be 
significantly less than the original investment amount. Furthermore, call features may create reinvestment risk for 
investors;Prinapa/ Protection — With principal protected notes, investors must hold the note to the stated maturity date 
for the full benefit of protection. Even if a registered note is fully principal protected, it is not FDIC-insured. Such notes are 
still subject to the issuer's credit risk. Thus, investors may lose their principal in the case of a liquidity crisis or other 
solvency problem with the issuer. Where a note does not have a principal protection feature, investors may lose part or all 
of their investment; Performance Payout — Performance is generally calculated based on the value of the referenced 
underlying on either a series of specified valuation dates or a single specified valuation date. Large declines or swings in 
the referenced underlying on a specified valuation date may have a disproportionate effect on the performance of the note 
and may greatly affect the note's expected return. Similarly, the value of a note may not necessarily reflect the movement 
in the underlying and vice versa; Capped Performance — Structured notes may limit an investor's participation in the 
upside performance of the referenced underlying. Typically, investors participate up to a pre-specified cap amount; 
however, they forego any additional performance in excess of the cap amount. Therefore, in instances of outperformance, 
investors in a structured note may earn lower returns when compared to a direct investment in the underlying; 
Referenced Underlying —The referenced underlying may have limited performance history. In these instances, the Term 
Sheet or Prospectus may have retroactively calculated or simulated historical performance, which should not be relied 
upon to predict future performance; Additional Risks — Depending on the underlying, the structured product may also 
involve interest rate, commodity, currency, credit, political, time value and general market risks. These risks vary from 
product to product.
