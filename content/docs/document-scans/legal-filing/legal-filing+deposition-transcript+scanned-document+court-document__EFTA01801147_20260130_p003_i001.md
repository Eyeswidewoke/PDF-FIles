SPECIAL SITUATIONS = 
* Starting in 2014 RDNT shifted its focus to =eleveraging 
* On March 25 RDNT completed a significant =ebt refinancing retiring its expensive $200m 10 3/8% Senior Notes 
=ue 2018 w/ $30.0 million of new first lien term loans (@ LIBOR =ate + 3.25% or the base rate plus 2.25%) + $180.0 
million of =ew second lien term loans (@ LIBOR + 7.0% or the base rate =lus 6.0%) 
* As a result RDNT has lowered cash interest =bligations by approx $5.1m/yr (vs. 2013 fcf of $17m) & termed 
=ut debt w/ its first lien term loan due in 2018 and its new second =ien term loan due in 2021 hence no =ear-term 
maturities * Going fwd ex small acquisition RDNT will utilize FCF to =ay down debt 
* RDNT's FCF for 2014 & 2015 is expected @ =35m & $44m implying a significant FCF yld of 28% & =6% 
* RDNT is tgt'ng net debt/ebitda @ =<4x* I expect net debt to ebitda cld drop to 4.8x by yrend =014 & 4.1x by 
yrend 2015' As RDNT de-levers given its sliver of equity =$120m mkt cap) vs. its net debt balance ($587m post refi) 
every 0.5x =hg in ebitda multiple adds $1.40/share to RUNT* Over the past decade RDNT has been valued @ an avg 7x 
=bitda 
* RDNT is presently valued @ 5.8x 2014 ebitda & 5.1x =wd ebitda 
* As conviction grows on RDNT's de-leveraging story RDNT =hld be afforded @ least 6x fwd ebitda multiple 
implying =pside @ $4.50+ or 50%+* Note that the consensus tgt px on RDNT is $3.63 implying =3% upside w/ a high tgt 
of $5.00 implying =0% upside 
* TRADE - BUY RDNT = CURRENT LEVELS 
* Business - RDNT is the leading national =rovider of freestanding, fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging 
=ervices in the United States based on number of locations and annual =maging revenue. At December 31, 2013, RDNT 
operated directly or =ndirectly through joint ventures, 250 centers located in California, =aryland, Florida, Delaware, 
New Jersey, Rhode Island and New =ork. RDNT's centers provide physicians with imaging =apabilities to facilitate the 
diagnosis and treatment of diseases and =isorders and may reduce unnecessary invasive procedures, often =educing the 
cost and amount of care for =atients. RDNT's services include magnetic resonance imaging =MRI), computed 
tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), =uclear medicine, mammography, ultrasound, diagnostic 
radiology =X-ray), fluoroscopy and other related procedures. The vast majority of =ur centers offer multi-modality 
imaging services, a key point of =ifferentiation from our competitors. RDNT's multi-modality strategy =iversifies revenue 
streams, reduces exposure to reimbursement changes =nd provides patients and referring physicians one location to
