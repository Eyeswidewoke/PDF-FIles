they transferred to the Company (-investment proportions'). No gambling or alcohol related investments may be made by the Company. 
Return on Investments: Until the full investment amount transferred to the Company by the Investor and other Investors has been repaid

making or realising investments, including any taxes, duties and similar charges ('transaction costs')) will be applied in repayment to all 
Investors in their investment proportions promptly upon receipt by the Company in respect of each Investment. Thereafter 70 per cent. of all 
distributions and sales proceeds from Investments (net of transaction costs) will be paid to all Investors in their investment proportions 
promptly upon receipt by the Company in respect of each Investment, and the remaining 30 per cent will be retained by the Company. 
If, on 28 February 2017 (the -temunaticn date'), the Company holds any Investment ('Remaining Investment', which shall include the 
securities comprising that Investment and any cash realised from Investment(s) net). the Remaining Investment will be transferred to all 
Investors (net of transaction costs) in their investment proportions on the following basis: (1) to the extent applicable on the termination date. 
the Remaining Investment will be so transferred to all Investors until the full investment amounts originally transferred by them have been 
repaid; (2) thereafter, 70 per cent. of any balance of the Remaining Investment will be so transferred to all Investors, and 30 per cent. will be 
retained by the Company; and (3) for these purposes. the Company will determine the value of the Remaining Investment using: (i) the price 
of the most recent issue of new securities or sale of existing securities subsequent to, and comprising, that Investment which was in respect 
of no less than 0.5 per cent. of the Issued equity securities of the company concerned (being, for each Investment. Its -valuation'); or (ii) in 
the event that an Investment did not have a valuation, the price of the most recent issue of new securities or sale of existing securities 
comprising that Investment. 
In the event that both of the Directors (as defined below): either (1) die or become immediately and permanently incapacitated so severely 
that it is impossible for either of them to act as a director of the Company: or (2) are certified by a registered medical practitioner treating that 
Director who gives a written opinion stating that such Director has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a director of the 
Company and may remain so for more than three months, then the provisions of the previous paragraph shall apply. In this case, the 
termination date shall be: either. in the case of (1). the date of the death or permanent incapacity of the second Director: and. in the case of
