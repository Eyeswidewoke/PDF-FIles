n=mber of warheads loaded on the two powers' strategic bombers and missile=, a major threat before 1990 but not a 
hot issue today. 
The quad's positi=n is best understood in the context of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treat= (NPT) that took effect in 
1970, which created two groups of nations: thos= that had nuclear weapons and agreed to give them up, and those that 
did not have them and promised not to seek=them. Many of the nuclear have-not class of countries lived up to th=ir 
NPT obligations and ended their nascent military nuclear programs in th= years that followed, including South Africa, 
Argentina, Brazil and Egypt. But the members of the "nuclear clu="—China, Russia, the UK, France and the United 
States—failed to hono= their commitments. These failures are often cited by nations such as Iran=when they vent their 
outrage at being pressured by the United States and other nuclear "haves" to not acquire nuclear =eapons. 
During his first ma=or speech about nuclear arms, in Prague in 2009, President Obama promised =o make amends by 
moving toward the promised land of zero nukes. In the fol=owing months, his administration invested much energy in 
fashioning a treaty with Russia that did reduce the nuclear=weapons of the old Cold War adversaries. But the treaty had 
no effect on t=e main sources of current threats: terrorists acquiring nukes in Pakistan =r North Korea and mounting 
them on long-range missiles, or Iran employing them to threaten Saudi Arabia an= Israel. 
Moreover, zero is a=dangerous notion. If either Russia or the U.S. concealed ten weapons more =han the levels currently 
permitted by the treaty, it would matter little, =ince both countries have hundreds of them. However, if one of the 
superpowers indeed gave up its entire nuclear=arsenal and the other then pulled ten out of a hiding place, it would 
pose=a major threat. Moreover, even if both Russia and the United States move t= a true and verified zero, any other 
nation that did not could blackmail one or both superpowers and the =est of the world merely by threatening to use its 
nuclear weapons.<=p> 
A world of zero nuk=s may be merely a vision President Obama projected to inspire other nation= to give up their 
nuclear ambitions, but he has failed to inspire any nati=n to give up its bombs or to stop making more. 
Consider the reason= nations develop a nuclear arsenal. Whatever Russia and the United States =o will not stop them. 
For example, Pakistan is retaining its weapons stock=ile because India has a much bigger population and can sustain a 
much larger conventional army than Pakistan. = nuclear capability thus serves, from the viewpoint of Islamabad, as the 
m=in deterrent against being overrun—Pakistan would maintain its arsenal e=en if the US. and Russia dismantled their 
last nukes. 
Iran seeks a nuclea= weapon to deter attacks by the United States and its allies, as a source =f prestige and possibly as 
the means needed to wipe out Israel. North Kore= claims to need nuclear weapons to deter the United States, Japan and 
South Korea from what it sees as their =ggressive tendencies—and views them as a major source of prestige as wel=. 
None of these reasons are much affected by whatever deals Moscow and Was=ington are making. 
Chasing the mirage =f a world without nukes distracts attention and uses up political capital =adly needed for addressing 
urgent problems concerning these arms. Top amon= these—if one is to focus on Russia—are not strategic arms but the 
tactical nuclear bombs and fissile materials te=rorists seek. Russia has an estimated arsenal of tactical nukes between 
fi=e thousand and fourteen thousand, while the United States has about one th=usand. However, New START does not 
cover tactical weapons. It deals exclusively with strategic weapons, w=ich terrorists are extremely unlikely to be able to 
handle. 
The nuclear arsenal= of rogue states and failing states are not being ignored by the Obama adm=nistration. It is trying 
diplomacy, engagement and even some sanctions in =ealing with Iran, and it is desperately seeking ways to deal with 
Pakistan and North Korea. But these discussions =re on a different track, where zero is not so much as mentioned. 
Thus, we see anothe= example in which Obama's speeches—which presumably set the direction of=US. foreign policy 
and are intended to inspire other nations—are out of =ync with the small efforts his administration is making in handling
