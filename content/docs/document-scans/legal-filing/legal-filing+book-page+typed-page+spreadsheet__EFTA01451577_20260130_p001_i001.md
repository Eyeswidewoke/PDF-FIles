The most recent driver of the secondary market sell side is the 'GP Seller category. The financial crisis has led to 
elongated hold times for many private equity funds, meaning that increasing numbers are reaching the end of their lives 
holding significant assets. The Fund Sponsors of these funds may not have raised subsequent funds and are now 
looking to the secondary market as they seek to reinvent themselves or maximise value in their tail-end portfolios. This 
generally occurs through the restructuring of the fund vehicle or portfolio when a secondary buyer (or syndicate) works 
together with the relevant Fund Sponsor to provide original investors with some options. The original investors can 
realise their interests in the fund vehicle or portfolio or instead transfer their investment in the existing fund vehicle or 
portfolio into a new vehicle in which such secondary buyer (or syndicate) also holds an interest. There are many buyout 
and venture funds that are nearing the end of their respective terms and do not have the ability to seek further term 
extensions. According to Preqin, there are over 150 pre-2000 vintage buyout funds and over 200 pre-2000 vintage 
venture funds active today and close to US$1 trillion in 2005 to 2008 vintage funds that will soon be reaching the ends of 
their investment periods, the Fund Sponsors of many of which have no prospect of raising a successor fund. 
A number of these funds are attractive candidates for secondary trades as their Fund Sponsors are turning to secondary 
buyers to provide a portfolio solution that will allow value to be maximised by selling at the right time rather than requiring 
such funds to liquidate their assets out of necessity at the end of their lives. These structures also allow secondary 
investors to have new and reinvigorated economics that align them with the management team, which is in tum 
incentivised to maximise value in the residual portfolio. 
The following chart summarises the Manager's macro view of the supply side of the market and the challenges these 
sellers are likely to face:

Secondary market pricing has rebounded from the high discounts and low volumes of 2009 to remain stable at around 
20% discount to net asset value from 2010 to date. The Manager believes that the secondary market transacts when 
headline pricing to the seller is in the 15% to 20% discount to reference date NAV range. In 2009, secondary volumes
