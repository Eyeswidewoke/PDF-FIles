Xu Guangyu, a retired major general in the People's Liberation Army and d=rector of the China Arms Control and 
Disarmament Association, said in an i=terview that the push by Chinese companies to develop and sell higher-tech=arms 
was "a very normal phenomenon." 
"In arms manufacturing, China is trying to increase the quality and reduc= price," he said. "We're driven by 
competition." 
Mr. Xu said that besides pricing, Chinese companies had another advantage: =hey do not "make demands over other 
governments' status and internal p=licies." He added: "Our policy of noninterference applies here. Whoeve= is in the 
government, whoever has diplomatic status with us, we can talk =bout arms sales with them." 
Chinese officials know that China's encroachment on Western-dominated mil=tary markets raises concerns. When asked 
about the missile-defense sale to=Turkey, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said, "China's military=exports do 
no harm to peace, security and stability," and do not "inte=fere with the internal affairs of recipient countries." 
The largest Chinese arms production companies, all state-owned, declined in=erview requests. Their finances are 
opaque, though there are some statisti=s on their Web sites and in the state news media. 
The China North Industries Group Corporation<http://www.norinco.com/c1024/e=glish/>, or the Norinco Group, said on 
its Web site that its profits in 20=2 were 9.81 billion renminbi, or about $1.6 billion, a 45 percent increase=from 2010. Its 
revenues in 2012 were 361.6 billion renminbi, or about $59 =illion, a 53 percent increase over 2010. Another company, 
the China South =ndustries Group Corporation, or CSGC, said on its Web site that it had pro=its of about $1 billion in 
2011, on revenue of about $45 billion, both big=increases over 2008. 
China's investment has been heaviest in fighter planes — both tradition=l and stealth versions — as well as in jet 
engines, an area in which Chi=a had until now been dependent on Western and Russian partners, said Guy A=derson, a 
senior military industry analyst in London with IHS Jane's. 
"China has been throwing billions and billions of dollars at research and=development," he said. "They also have a 
strategy of using the gains t=ey get from foreign partnerships to benefit their industrial sector. So th=y should not have 
any trouble catching up with their Western competitors o=er the medium term, and certainly over the long term." 
He estimated that China was still a decade away from competing head-to-head=with Western nations on the technology 
itself. But Chinese equipment is pr=ced lower and could become popular in emerging markets, including in Afric=n and 
Latin American nations. 
"We are in an era of 'good enough' — the 90 percent solution that w=ll do the job at the best possible price," Mr. 
Anderson said. "In some=cases, that may even mean buying commercial equipment, upgrading it slight=y and painting it 
khaki." 
New customers for Chinese equipment include Argentina, which in 2011 signed=a deal with the Chinese company 
Avicopter to build Z-11 light helicopters =nder license. Mass production for the Argentine military began this year, =nd 
40 helicopters are expected to be built over the next several years. Th= value of the contract has not been made public. 
Companies selling drones, another focal point in the Chinese arms industry,=are ubiquitous at arms and aviation shows. 
At an aviation exposition in Be=jing in late September, one Chinese company, China Aerospace Science and T=chnology 
Corporation<http://english.spacechina.com/n16421/index.html>, had=on display a model of a CH-4 reconnaissance and 
combat drone, with four motels of missiles next to it. 
Though the drone had been "designed for export," one company representa=ive said, there were no foreign buyers yet. 
The company was still being li=ensed by the government to sell the aircraft abroad. He added that the dro=e was not yet 
up to par with some foreign models, and that the engine was = foreign make, though other parts — including the 
missiles — had been =eveloped in China. 
The Aviation Industry Corporation of China<http://www.avic2.com/>, or AVIC,=had on display a model of a Wing Wong, 
the best-known Chinese drone expor=, which sells for about $1 million, less than similar American and Israeli=drone 
models. An article in People's Daily said the export certificate f=r the Wing Loong, or Pterodactyl, was approved in June 
2009, and it was fi=st exported in 2011. 
At the Paris Air Show in June, Ma Zhiping, president of the China National =ero-Technology Import and Export 
Corporation, told Global Times, another s=ate-run newspaper, that "quite a few countries" had bought the Wing 
lo=ng<http://theaviationist.com/2012/11/20/pterodactylM.Uml8gBCslBk>, which =esembles the American-made 
Predator. Clients were in Africa and Asia, he s=id. 
Two fighter jets made by Chinese companies are being closely watched by ind=stry analysts and foreign companies for 
their export potential. One is She=yang Aircraft's J-31<http://theaviationist.com/2012/09/16/j-31M.UmL9FhC=JBk>, a
