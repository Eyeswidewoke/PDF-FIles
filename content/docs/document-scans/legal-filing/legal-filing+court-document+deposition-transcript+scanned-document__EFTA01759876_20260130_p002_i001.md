The Daily Beast 
Obama's New Syria Options 
Leslie H. Gelb<http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/leslie-h-gelb.html= 
Aug 25, 2013-- After the most recent use of chemical weapons in 
Syria<http:=/www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/21/new-chemical-weapons-attack-cou=d-kill-obama-s-syria-
strategy.html>, President Obama is sheltering his nex= moves even from his closest advisers as the whole Obama 
administration in=hes painfully toward what they all see as the moment of truth in Syria. 
Once again, he could walk away from the use of force because that option ha= little backing either in his administration 
or among Americans generally.=But after an endless run of inter-agency meetings at the White House, the =ense is that 
he is nearing three conclusions: first, the Syrian government=has put his credibility on the line irrevocably and 
inescapably; second, h= now must take direct military action to punish the government of Presiden= Bashar al-Assad, 
though not in a manner that commits him to further use a= force; and third, he needs to combine whatever force he 
uses now with dra=atic and diplomatic initiatives. 
Officials expect White House decisions to come quickly at this point. Most =fficials openly lament how they are being 
whipsawed between a general cons=nsus in the administration against employing U.S. military force backed by=huge 
opposition to doing so (60 percent) among polled Americans, and a gro=ing and potent consensus among foreign policy 
experts and politicians to g=ve Assad a hard punch. 
Most administration officials and most Americans just can't see any lasti=g benefits from any form of direct U.S. military 
involvement in Syria, and=they fear that initial actions would lead only to more and more force. On =he other hand, 
policy experts and politicians are arguing with increasing =igor that America's and Obama's credibility in the Middle East 
and in =he world are on the line, that he has drawn so many red 
lines<http://www.t=edailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/05/obama-s-syrian-red-line-could-return-u=-to-the-mistakes-of-
iraq.html> against Assad's use of chemicals that nei=her he nor the U.S. can afford further thumb-sucking. This 
credibility arg=ment is deeply reinforced by a humanitarian one. The 
refugee<http://www.th=dailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/08/23/syrian-refugee-crisis-reaches-one-=illion-
children.html> and death tolls<http://www.thedailybeast.com/article=/2012/08/27/syrian-uprising-body-count-spikes-
as-assad-forces-massacre-civ=lians.html> are already sky high and leaping daily and now require more th=n mere 
rhetoric and emergency aid. 
With these pressures and considerations in mind, here are the overlapping p=licy choices the Obama team has looked at 
over the last week: 
1. Wait on the reports of U.N. inspectors, now apparently heading toward th= site where chemical weapons were, in all 
probability, fired off. The expe=tation is the inspectors will find that such weapons were, in fact, employ=d. Few expect 
the inspectors can come to a definitive conclusion on whethe= the government or the rebels fired them. But the 
presumption is bound to =e that the weapons belong to the government and that the government was re=ponsible. As 
quickly as possible, take the matter to the U.N. Security Cou=cil, but anticipate a Russian and Chinese veto of military 
action. Taking =hese steps is more or less a given for Obama to satisfy his impulses to bo= to international law. 
2. Meantime, go to friendly Arab states, such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf =mirates, plus key European allies such as 
Britain and France and see if th=y will join a military coalition as they did in 
Libyachttp://www.thedailyb=ast.com/newsweek/2011/04/03/nicolas-sarkozy-s-war-on-gaddafi-influenced-
by=philosopher-bernard-henri-levy.html>. This wouldn't provide full interna=ional or legal cover, but it would help. U.S. 
officials don't expect muc= support from Arab states, but hope for some from Paris and London. All th=s is to ensure the 
U.S. doesn't have to act alone. 
3. Provide more and better military arms to the rebels, and this time actua=ly expedite the equipment. Most 
administration officials still don't li=e this option. They remain unconvinced that they know enough about the reb=ls to 
make sure the aid doesn't fall into the wrong hands<http://www.the=ailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/15/will-arming-
syrian-rebels-lead-to-disast=r.html>. 
4. Attack Syrian government military targets with cruise missiles, drones o= with the foregoing plus piloted U.S. aircraft. 
The number of attacks woul= be limited. The U.S. military still doesn't care for this option any mo=e than it likes the idea 
of arming the rebels. They don't see its having=much effect on either Syrian capability or morale. They worry that it 
will=produce only demands for more bombing.
