2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93633, * 
Fed. Appx. 93, at *97 (quoting In re Beverly Mfg. Corp., 778 F.2d 666, 667 (11th Cir. 
1985)); see also Nielsen v. Price, 17 F.3d 1276, 1277 (10th Cir. 1994) ['7] (upholding 
dismissal of bankruptcy appeal for failure to follow Bankruptcy Rules or timely file appeal 
brief where plaintiffs provided no explanation or excuse for noncompliance); In re 
Champion, 895 F.2d 490, 492 (8th Cir. 1990) (finding no abuse of discretion in dismissing 
appeal where appellant had not filed designation of record or statement of issues required 
by Bankruptcy Rule 8006); In m Tampa Chain Co., 835 F.2d 54, 56 (2d Cir. 1987) 
(affirming dismissal of bankruptcy appeal for failure to file a brief for seven months after the 
due date or provide any explanation for the failure, even after the court's inquiry into 
delinquency). 
Given that backdrop, the Court will now assess whether the Poulis factors favor or disfavor 
dismissal. 
1. Extent of North Shore's Personal ROsponsidIrly 
The first Poulis factor assesses the extent of the appellant's personal responsibility. 747 
F.2d at 868. North Shore has suggested that its counsel is responsible for its failure to 
follow the Court's scheduling order. North Shore averred that, 
Defendant. Chapter 7 Debtor Jeffrey J. Prosser (Case No. 06-30009), and his farndy. including Dawn Prosser. the 
owner of North Store. are overwrought and under NI assault with numerous and often duplicate suits replete with 
continuous motions and actions... 
(Appellant's Mem. Supp. Mot. Leave to File Untimely Resp. 2, ECF No. 4). North Shore 
also contended that it is "without the financial resources to employ an adequate number of 
counsel that have the time availability to meet the relentless and continuous assault and 
actions..." Id. North Shore went on to aver that it has "mounted a defense with far too small 
group [sic] of counsel and others which have committed what time they can and what effort 
they can, when possible, for little, or in most cases, for no compensation." Id. 
Indeed, North Shore referred generally to the commotion of the bankruptcy proceedings in 
explaining its failure to comply with the original scheduling order in this matter. North Shore 
also pointed to the limited size of its legal team and financial resources. Because it seems 
that North Shore's counsel was at least somewhat responsible for North Shore's failure to 
comply with the Court's original scheduling order, the first Poulis factor does not 
necessarily weigh in favor of dismissal. 
However, [HN5] North Shore's "lack of responsibility for [its] counsel's dilatory conduct 
[a 9] is not dispositive, because a client cannot always avoid the consequences of the acts 
or omissions of its counsel." See Poulis, 747 F.2d at 868; see also Ware v. Rodale Press, 
Inc., 322 F.3d 218, 222 (3d Cir. 2003)("[E]ven assuming that WCI does not bear 
responsibility for its counsel's conduct, consideration of the remaining factors still compels 
affirming the District Court's decision to sanction WCI and dismiss the breach of contract 
claim."); cf. Lee v. Sunrise Senior Living, 455 Fed. Appx. 199, 201-202 (3d Cir. 2011) 
(finding that the pro se plaintiff was "fully responsible for her conduct.") The Court also 
notes that North Shore has not offered any explanation for its failure to comply with the 
March 28, 2012, scheduling order.
