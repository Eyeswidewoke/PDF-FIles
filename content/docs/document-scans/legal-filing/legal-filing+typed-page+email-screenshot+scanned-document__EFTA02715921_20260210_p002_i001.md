medicine and pyschology were during the industrial rev=lution, when machines were the examples. the body as a 
machine=was the way to look and try to figure out what was going on. =C2 hydrualics. for muschle . s cranes joits 
pul=eys.. for psychological issues the machine and some of =ts terms became inbedded in the system. thinking like a 
well o=led machine. input output, computation, memory„ 
=C2 the view was that a dream state was turned on when one fell as=eep/ the equivalent of going to the movies. 
=hat was on the screen was then analyed , examied frightened amiused=C2 , it was in a dark enclosed skupp of a room. 
people wer able to fly.=C2 etc. I think that there is another more biologial system=explantantion. I postualte that 
dreams are ALWAYS on. =AO running 24 hours a day, one gets to experince them when the=screen of conciousness 
drops away, it is that conciouness sets=a screen in front of the dreams. I takes energy to keep the conciuos=es screen 
continuous, and opaque with respect the dreams. if c=nciousess screen starts to fade. we can see behind an start 
to=day dream, if we are unable to craft a screen with no holes =AO we are fine but that takes enerngy and sleep to fill 
in the holes. =AO without sleep the holes form and dreams start poking their =ay through. schizohrenia is a person not 
being able to disting=ish between dreaming and reality. he is walking in the street =ut he hears his mother . the 
neighborhood cat might speak to h=m. things that everyone experiecens in their dreams the =chizoid cannot tell the 
differnece his screen is damaged. =AO the dreams behind the conciosness screen are tied to the emotions=, why am i 
in a bad mood , could be because I am having a bad dream =ehind my conciousness screen, a feeling of dread„ 
somethin h=ppend in my dream. etc. . it turns out that schizoeds su=fer sleep ailments. sleep deprivation causes 
hallu=inations. ( dreams while awake). the conbciuousess scree= is tied to our senses. run through focus filters. with a 
feedback t=at in some instances are hard wired, aversion , danger,  =AO its the acgivity behind the screen that answers 
the compleix ques=otns. the aha moment is when the dream room sends its message to the=conciouness room. 
2 music , most anim=ls make sounds. what does music represent. it is m=lody prosody, inforamtion both 
verticaland horizonal. ch=rds melody. . as it is generated from the brain can it be reve=sed engineered and used to 
probel the workings of the machine tha creatied=it. . listeing to a flute, and its tonal quality =C2 from the sound 
analysisi , a long empyt tube can be postualted. =AO but thats only its structure, rythms are a prod=ct of the player not 
only the structure. do german marches provide i=site into a german mind. is it organized regulaid. =beats that range 
from 30 - 12 bpm. do afro americnacs.=C2 think more like jazz. somewhat off the beat. ( hum=r. unpredictable 
movements making it harder for a german to tackle down th= field.. ). why do soldiers march further t= music, 
runners run further. . A symphonic s=ructure is theme repetition vaitaion on the themes conclusion.=C2 the same 
dictum given to public speakers. tell the= what you are going to say, say it , tell them what you said.=C2 
3. mathematics is the search for truth. =AO algorithms that do not change there result with the passing of the day.=C2 . 
mathematics stands outside of time. the ideal of a poi=t or line ( separte from einsteins measuemrnt issues as the actaul 
measure=ent is much more diffcult . requiring a beggining and and end =herefore measurement lives in time space. 
mathematics is=the search for truth. I postualte that Biology and biological =ystems differ from mathematics beacuse it 
is needs deception to survive. b=ological systems only make sense in time space. , trying to st=y away from what is the 
moment of life or death. . preda=or prey. biuoogical systems need free energy in order to=maintain structure 
dissintegraing from entropy, eneygy n=eds to be ingested inorder to fight the slope down to breaking apart and 
r=turning to dust. . getting energy, the=most basic bio requirement. in bio systems however the best wa= to get 
energy is either from the sun, a limtied chenical reaction or heat=gradisent. the energy must come from outside. the 
way fo= systems to gain enery is to eat it. the way not to die is to eat an=not be eaten. . the game of eat or not be eaten 
is very sophisticated =AO what is the entity . the cell. the organ , the organ=sm . the community on and on. 
heirarchila ne=ted systems. at every level decision have to be made , i= it ok to sacrifice a few cells so that the 
organism can live. =which cells. do they get a choice? how many when .=C2 when the organism is eaten by its 
predator. how did it try to =rotect itself. camaflouge, surrounding itself in junk, m=micryy, misdirection, 
misinformation. etc.. qurum sensin= game theory, free will, bait, ants, .
