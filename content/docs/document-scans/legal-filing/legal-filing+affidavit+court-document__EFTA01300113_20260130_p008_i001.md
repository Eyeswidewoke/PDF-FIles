Those people know well that they can't bracket the relationship between both Emirates into just a financial 
relation. The money element is a very minimal component in a superior relationship built on family ties with a 
unity soul, with "tolerance" essence and foundation concurred by both Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Rashid on 18 
February 1968, when they met and issued a historical statement announcing the establishment of a federal union 
between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and called on their brothers in the neighboring emirates to join the union. Do you 
know what it meant for us to stand few days ago with His Highness Sheikh Khalifa at the "Union House" under 
the UAE flag, and in the same place where our ancestors stood the day of the UAE announcement? Would you 
be able to appraise our feelings at that moment? These are moments that you cannot ponder easily. They are 
priceless. 
Those who know the truth about the Abu Dhabi and Dubai relationship and all the other Emirates, are well aware 
that the federation of the UAE is a choice of wise and liberated people who are guided by their heart, beliefs and 
wisdom. They are people who God Almighty described as ready to sacrifice their souls for others. Again, I remind 
you of what His Highness Sheikh Khalifa said. "We are ... one strong, coherent body.

The United Arab Emirates is a federation but there is a tendency, particularly in health and 
education, to allow individual emirates to dictate policy. Will this continue or will the 
federal government seek to establish a more unified national approach on domestic policy? 
None of the seven emirates develops its own independent health and educational policies. All legislation and 
policies related to education and overall health are developed at the federal level. What is happening is precisely 
the expansion of the decentralized planning and implementation in order to raise the efficiency of education and 
medical services. This is what we see in industrialized countries, such as the United States and the United 
Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and others. Our experience in education foundered for many reasons, and we 
are racing against time to make up for what we missed and to create sustainable development in the education 
sector. Of course, the process of development widens then to diversify the teaching methods and to attract broad 
participation of the private sector.

The Federal National Council has expressed concern that its views are ignored by the UAE 
cabinet and that, in reality, they have little power. What Me do you see the FNC playing 
within the country's decision-making p rocess, and in what way is the Council likely to 
evolve in the future? 
We never received any complaints against the government for ignoring the views of the Council; instead we 
always receive compliments and appreciation about cooperation. We constantly express our appreciation to the 
Council for its role in the decision-making process. In fact, draft laws first have to pass through the FNC for 
review and recommendations, and later sent back to the Cabinet for consideration and approval. 
The Council is also empowered to summon and to question any Federal Minister regarding Ministry performance. 
We believe in the importance of the Council, and we respect its effective role in the process since its inception. 
The current session marked a beginning of change in the Council in the method of selecting its members. We 
witnessed for the first time the formation of election associations in the UAE to elect half the members of the 
40-member Council, with 22 percent of members of the Council being women, one of the highest such rates in 
the world.
