Subject: Frieze London 2016: Client Nomination process 
Frieze London 2016 
October 5-9, Regents Park, London 
Frieze London will return to Regents Park, London from October 5 to 9, 2016. This year's fair brings together more than 
160 of the world's leading galleries, alongside the fair's celebrated non-profit program of ambitious new artist 
commissions and talks. In 2016 the fair will debut a new gallery section, The 90s, recreating seminal exhibitions from the 
decade, alongside the return of sections Focus and Live, the definitive platforms for emerging galleries and performance 
art respectively. Frieze London coincides with Frieze Masters and the Frieze Sculpture Park, and is supported by main 
sponsor Deutsche Bank for the 13th consecutive year. More information on the Fair is available at 
http://friezelondon.com/.
This year's presentation in the Deutsche Bank Lounge at Frieze London showcases Sarnath Banerjee, who is famous for 
his bold and humorous works, centred on universal themes, common experiences and his Indian background and 
culture. Banerjee describes himself as a recorder of a rapidly changing world - "In ten pages you can describe a whole 
universe. That's the power of text and image". The installation in the Deutsche Bank Lounge will be large and colourful, 
encompass image and text and will center on the theme The Wandering Mind'. The Lounge links to a commissioned 
artwork Banerjee is doing for a new Deutsche Bank building in Canary Wharf where each floor of artworks form a 
chapter of a book.
