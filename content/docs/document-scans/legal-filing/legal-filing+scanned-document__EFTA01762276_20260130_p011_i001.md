The more worrisome =hreat is subtler: that the Chinese (or some other powers) will use their a=ility to wreak 
cyberhavoc as leverage to strengthen their position, and we=ken ours, in a diplomatic crisis or a conventional war.

For instance, in a =rewing conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea (areas where China has =sserted claims 
aggressively in recent years), would an American president =espond with full military force if he knew that the Chinese 
would retaliate by turning out all the lights on =he Eastern Seaboard? 
A familiar concept =n strategic war games is "escalation-dominance." The idea is that vict=ry goes to the player who can 
take a conflict to the next level of violenc= in a way that inflicts enormous damage on his opponent but very little on 
himself. The expected outcome of the ne=t round is so obvious that the opponent decides not to escalate; the domin=nt 
player thus controls the subsequent course of the battle and possibly w=ns the war. 
Real war is messier=than war games. Escalation holds risks all round. The two sides might have=different perceptions of 
which one is dominant. Or the dominant side might=miscalculate the opponent's strategic priorities. For instance, China 
might think the American president values =ninterrupted electricity on the East Coast more than a free, independent 
T=iwan—but that thought might be mistaken. 
Still, leaders in w=r and crisis do take these kinds of factors into account. Many surrenders =n history have been 
prompted less by the damage already absorbed than by f=ars of the damage to come. 
And China is not th= only foe or rival whose calculations are complicating this new cyber worl=. Iran is another. last 
summer, all of a sudden, a computer virus nickname= executive order on cybersecurity<=a>. In recent years, Congress 
has rejecter bills requiring Internet service providers to follow government standards on security for various reasons, 
many of th=m legitimate. The executive order at least allows government agencies to s=are information with ISPs, some 
of it classified, on how to meet these sta=dards themselves. It's a good first step.

But there's anoth=r way to stave off the danger of cyberwar, and that's diplomacy.<=p> 
In his extremely im=ortant 2010 book Cyber War

SIN=006=962244&linkCode=as2&tag=slatmaga-20> , Richard Clarke likened the current era to the decade after the first 
atom'= bombs, when American, then Soviet, scientists built these weapons of enor=ous destructiveness—but before 
politicians or strategists devised ways o= thinking about them rationally: how to control them, deter their use, or limit 
their damage if a war could='t be deterred. 
It's time to move=on to the next era, when this sort of thinking did occur, not just in secr=tive research tanks but also in 
open discussions and international negotia=ions. Clarke, who was chief of counterterrorism and cybersecurity for 
Presidents Clinton and Bush, spells out ways that co=cepts from nuclear arms control—inspections and verification, no 
first u=e, and ideas from other accords, including the Geneva Conventions—might =e applied to cyberweapons. 
In any case, it's=sheer silliness, at this point, to keep cyber issues off the table for fea= of upsetting the sensitivities of 
Chinese officials (who deny that they h=ve offensive cyberwarfare programs) and thus possibly triggering a diplomatic 
crisis. A crisis already looms from =11 sides of the globe; the United States, after all, has an offensive cybe=warfare 
program, too. Best to deal with it head-on, and soon.
