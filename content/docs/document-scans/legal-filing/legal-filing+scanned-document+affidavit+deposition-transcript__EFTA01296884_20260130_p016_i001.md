United States Courts Opinions: Supreme Court of New York: Neary v Burns US Official 
News April 1, 2014 Tuesday 
Burns argues that plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action because there was no 
wrongdoing by him. Burns' attorney asserts that Bums sent e-mails discussing at length 
that 2784 LLC would give a loan to Neptune LLC and that this loan was authorized by the 
members. She further asserts that there is no damage to any member because the 
$250,000 loaned by 2784 LLC is earning interest at five percent and is secured by the real 
estate, and that when the Neptune Avenue premises are sold, the mortgage will be paid to 
2784 LLC with interest and all of the members of both 2784 LLC and Neptune LLC will 
receive their pro rata shares. She also states that plaintiffs received payments at the same 
time and "in pro rata amounts as the other members." 
The second amended complaint, however, does not challenge the $250,000 loan made by 
2784 LLC to Neptune LLC and does not allege that the sale of the 2784 premises was 
unauthorized. Rather, plaintiffs assert that Burns wrongfully deprived them of their fair 
share of the distributions from the net proceeds of the sale of these premises. Specifically, 
plaintiffs contend that Burns unilaterally and wrongfully withheld sums from their individual 
distributions because of their refusal to vacate their rent-stabilized apartments at the 
Neptune Avenue premises. Plaintiffs have annexed a letter by Burns dated March 9, 2010 
(exhibit E to plaintiffs' opposition papers), which establishes that Burns, referring to 
Benevento and Neary's apartments at the Neptune Avenue premises, unilaterally 
deducted from their individual distributions of the net sale proceeds of the 2784 premises 
that were issued by 2784 LLC in March 2010, amounts for "disparate benefits" that Burns 
claims they received by virtue of their rent-stabilized tenancies at the Neptune Avenue 
premises. This letter shows that in contrast to the distributions to plaintiffs, these sums 
were not deducted from the distributions received by the other two Neary members 
(Salvatore and Mary Ann), Anthony (Benevento's brother), or Grace, who were paid their 
distributions in full. 
Burns further argues that he should be absolved from liability pursuant to article 4.5 of the 
Operating Agreement (exhibit 7 to Burns' motion papers), which provides as follows: 
"A Manager shall not be personally liable to the Company or its Members for damages 
for any breach of duty as a Manager, except for any matter in respect to which such 
Manager shall be liable by reason that, in addition to any and all other requirements for 
such liability, there shall have been a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such 
["11]Manager that establishes that such Manager's acts or omissions were in bad faith or 
involved intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or that such Manager 
personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which such Manager was 
not legally entitled or that with respect to a distribution the subject of Section 508 of the 
[Limited Liability Company Law], such Manager's acts were not performed in accordance 
with Section 409 of the [Limited Liability Company Law] . . ." 
Limited Liability Company Law § 508 refers to limitations on distributions to members. 
Limited Liability Company Law § 409 (a) provides that "[a] manager shall perform his or 
her duties as a manager, including his or her duties as a member of any class of 
managers, in good faith and with that degree of care that an ordinarily prudent person in a 
like position would use under similar circumstances." 
Burns contends that he did not act in bad faith or engage in intentional misconduct. 
However, plaintiffs' allegations, which must be deemed true for purposes of this motion,
