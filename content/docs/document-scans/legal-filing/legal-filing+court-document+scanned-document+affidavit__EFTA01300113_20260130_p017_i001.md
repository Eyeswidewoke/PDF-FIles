with the world after the crisis; a world completely different than what it was before. As for the forces of federal 
entities, the fact is that the strength of these entities is what enabled them to cope with the crisis and contain its 
negative effects. 
By Thabet Amin Awad of Al Abram Egyptian newspaper 
You have said that "our vision is clear, our goals are obvious, our strengths are great, our 
will is strong and we are ready. We want Dubai to be a global center of excellence, creativity 
and leadership, and we are able to achieve excellence, creativity and leadership." Do you 
still stand by your vision? If yes, how so? 
Yes, we still stand by it. Plans, programs and projects may alter, but the vision does not change. We want the 
UAE and Dubai to be a global center of excellence, innovation and leadership, and we are indeed on the 
rightful=2 Oroad. You ask how? I tell you: the global financial crisis is a challenge we have faced and surpassed in 
its most difficult stages. We are insistent on developing the education and obtaining excellence in all our projects 
and our work, in addition to protecting our favorable environment for innovation and leadership. What we have 
achieved over the past 10 years is characterized with excellence and leadership, and we are capable and 
determined to achieve what is more excellent, innovative and prominent in the future.

Your Highness, you asked the Ministry of Finance last year to prepare the federal budget of 
the State 2009. The early announcement prior to the global economic crisis has resulted in a 
deficit-free budget. Would the global crisis have implications on the 2010 budget, 
particularly with regard to the basic needs of Emirati citizens? 
In the last three years, the federal budget was issued early and before entering the new fiscal year. The 
submission of the budget for 2009 without a deficit is because its main provisions have not been affected by the 
global financial crisis. I also do not think that 2010 budget will be affected. We still have seven months for the 
year to end, and in my opinion this is quite a long period -- we may see by the end of it some positive indicators 
that would help in accelerating the recovery of the global economy.

There are those who say that the senior positions in Dubai are granted to a few selected 
people, which is described as the phenomenon of the "Super Man." How would you 
comment on this? 
My answer is that all positions are available to competent Etniratis and we are very keen on rejuvenating our 
system. The "Super Man" phenomenon that you are talking about does not exist in our organizations and 
institutions. I am aware of those reports but would invite you and others to conduct a search within those senior 
positions to discover the truth on your own.

In light of the global crisis some companies announced the postponement and rescheduling 
of some projects. What is the status of the infrastructure projects undertaken by the 
government subsequent to the changes in the strategic plans?
