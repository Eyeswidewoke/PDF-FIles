Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted Revenue alongside other financial performance measures, 
including total net revenue and our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a

Adjusted EBITDA 
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net loss, adjusted to eliminate the effect of Starbucks 
transaction revenue and Starbucks transaction costs, before interest income and expense, provision or benefit for income taxes, 
depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation expense, other income and expense, the gain or loss on the sale of property 
and equipment, and impairment of intangible assets. We have included Adjusted EBITDA in

this prospectus because it is a key measure used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future 
operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of intemal 
resources. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and 
evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful 
measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash items and certain variable 
charges. 
We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation 
expenses, from our Adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the 
underlying performance of our business operations. We exclude Starbucks transaction revenue and Starbucks transaction costs 
because Starbucks has announced it will transition to another payment processor. We believe that providing Adjusted EBITDA 
metrics that exclude the impact of our agreement with Starbucks is useful to investors. We exclude gain or loss on the sale of 
property and equipment, and impairment of intangible assets from Adjusted EBITDA because we do not believe that these items 
are reflective of our ongoing business operations. In addition, we believe it is useful to exclude interest income and expense, other 
income and expense, and provision or benefit from income taxes, as these items are not components of our core business 
operations. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not 
meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the 
following: 
although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be 
replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements 
or for new capital expenditures or other capital commitments; 
• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in. or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the effect of income taxes that may represent a reduction in cash available to us: 
• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the effect of foreign currency exchange gains or losses which are included in other 
income and expense: and 
• other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from how we calculate 
this measure or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.
