2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87203, * 
Request number 16 seeks materials demonstrating that persons inside the United States 
Attorney's Office had improper relationships with persons close to Epstein. (DE 260 at 3). 
Petitioners argue that these documents "show(] that a prosecutor working inside the U.S. 
Attorney's Office when the deal was being arranged left the office r31] shortly thereafter 
and began representing persons close to Epstein (such as his pilots)." (DE 266 at 11). 
They argue that such materials are relevant to their CVRA case because "if one of the 
prosecutors in the Office was not working for the best interests of the United States, but 
rather for those of Epstein, that would be clear evidence of motive to intentionally keep the 
victims in the dark." (Id. at 11). The Court concludes that production of such documents 
should not issue. 
After its in camera review, the Court finds that the documents discussing the issue of 
whether an improper relationship existed between a former prosecutor and Epstein's co-
conspirators are not relevant to this proceeding. The issue of whether a prosecutor 
violated ethical canons by representing persons with close ties to Epstein after his 
retirement from the United States Attorney's Office does not bear on the issue of whether 
the Government violated Petitioners' CVRA rights during its negotiations with Epstein. The 
only impropriety to which Petitioners point occurred after the prosecutor's departure from 
the Government. The OPR—which opened an inquiry into the matter at Petitioners' 
counsel's request--closed their inquiry r32] into the matter by noting that the OPR has 
jurisdiction to investigate allegations of misconduct involving only current Department of 
Justice attorneys. (See P-O13937;' see also P-0013946). The OPR did not investigate the 
matter further, and it issued no factual determinations on whether a conflict existed before 
the prosecutors departure. Any OPR correspondence regarding this inquiry that is not 
otherwise privileged is irrelevant to this CVRA litigation. (See Table at P-013944, P-
013945). 
5 This is a draft letter addressed to Petitioners' counsel from an OPR attorney. The Court assumes Plaintiffs counsel received 
the final version of this letter explairing the OPR's reasons for closing its investigation. 
In the same vein, correspondence between the United States Attorney's Office and the 
OPR regarding self-reporting of conflicts alleged by Epstein's defense counsel are 
irrelevant to this proceeding.° (DE 212-1 at 21-22); (see Table at P-013227-013247). 
6 Ironically. Epstein's counsel raised conflict-of-interest concerns because they believed that certain prosecutors were too close 
to persons associated with the victims. 
4. Request No. 18--Documents Concerning Recusal of the United States Attorney's 
r33] Office for the Southern District of Florida 
Request number 18 seeks information about why the United States Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of Florida was "'conflicted out' of handing various issues related to the 
Epstein case." (DE 266 at 11). Specifically, it requests "all documents, correspondence, 
and other information regarding the potential conflicts of interest that the Justice 
Department discussed or determined existed for the USAO SDFL, as well as any referral
