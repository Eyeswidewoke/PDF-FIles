UBS Client Relationship Agreement 
Representations and Agreement for Trustee Certification 
Representation of a Trust Agreement in Effect 
For trust accounts, each Trustee, certifies, represents and warrants that the trust to which 
this certification applies is in full force and effect and that the information you have 
supplied to UBS is true and accurate, as we rely on that information to service your 
accounts. 
Unless we are updated subsequently by the trustees, UBS will rely on this certification, 
which includes the information you provide on the Signature Page, to service accounts you 
may open in the future for the same trust. By signing a UBS Trustee Certification and 
Agreement, you agree that: 
• 
Each trustee (or a corporate officer if the account is a corporate trust) executed the 
certification. 
• 
You have full power under the trust agreement and applicable law to submit valid 
orders and other instructions relative to the trust Account(s). 
• 
The trust agreement authorizes you to make distributions and transfers from the 
trust. 
• 
You have received and read the "UBS Client Relationship Agreement" and the 
documents it references and agree to those terms and conditions for all accounts you 
open on behalf of the trust. 
• 
As Trustee(s), you have broad investment powers under the Trust and applicable law. 
You have noted any restrictions on your power as trustee(s) on the Signature Page for 
the first trust account you open, and agree that the powers and restrictions listed 
here and on the Signature Page are accurate and complete. 
Trustee's Ability to Bind the Trust 
Unless you indicate otherwise on the Signature Page, you agree that any individual trustee 
may independently exercise any of the trust's powers. This means that UBS is authorized to 
take instructions from and accept any document on behalf of the trust (including but not 
limited to agreements to arbitrate all disputes involving the trust account) signed by any 
one of the trustees. You agree that UBS may, in its discretion, require the joint action of all 
trustees whenever UBS deems such joint action to be necessary or appropriate. 
By signing a UBS Trustee Certification and Agreement, you agree that: 
• 
Unless you have noted otherwise, you have the authority to pledge, mortgage, assign 
or subject to a security interest or lien in favor of UBS, any property of the trust as 
security for any liability of the trust. 
• 
You have the authority to execute any and all relevant documents and bind the trust 
to any agreements entered into with respect to such activities. 
• 
You understand that, if you have requested margin privileges on behalf of 
the trust, UBS holds securities in margin-eligible trust accounts as a lien 
against the amounts borrowed by the trust, and you agree to maintain 
sufficient collateral in the account to meet margin calls we might issue. 
Trustee's Acknowledgement 
By signing a UBS Trustee Certification and Agreement, you agree that: 
• 
UBS may assume without further inquiry and is not required to confirm your power 
and authority as trustee(s) or to verify instructions for the delivery of any money or 
property to you as trustee(s). 
• 
UBS is not required to confirm that you are properly exercising your power and 
authority unless UBS has actual knowledge to the contrary. 
The "1.185 Client Relationship 
Agreement" plus the additional 
information, terms and conditions, 
and disclosures pertaining to the 
accounts and services you have 
requested UBS to establish for the 
Trust govern the overall relationship 
between the Trust and UBS.
