Dolton, Illinois Police Officer Charged in Federal Court With Bankruptcy Fraud 
CBS News (08/12, Feurer) reported that former Dolton Deputy Police Chief Lewis Lacey was indicted Monday on 
federal charges accusing him of lying about his income in an attempt to avoid paying a settlement in a lawsuit. 
Lacey, 61, has been charged with five counts of bankruptcy fraud, two counts of making false statements in a 
bankruptcy case, and two counts of perjury. Federal prosecutors said Lacey has filed several personal bankruptcy 
petitions since the 1980s, including petitions in 2019 and 2020, after agreeing to a $55,000 settlement agreement 
in 2017 in a lawsuit filed against him in state court. Those bankruptcy petitions automatically stayed enforcement 
of the settlement agreement, for which he still owed $43,000 at the time. Prosecutors said Lacey repeatedly lied 
about his monthly income in the bankruptcy cases and concealed multiple bank accounts that he controlled. A DOJ 
press release noted that the FBI participated in the announced indictment. 
TikTok Influencer Who Peddles Riches Through Real Estate Is Arrested on Wire Fraud Charges 
The Independent (08/12, Rohrlich) reported that a TikTok-famous real estate flipper whose videos have racked up 
more than 3 million views is now facing federal charges over accusations he sold unwitting clients wildly lucrative 
"investment opportunities" in properties he never actually owned. The article stated that on Monday, a criminal 
complaint against Miller, 34, was unsealed in West Virginia federal court, charging him with one count of wire 
fraud. Miller, who does not yet have an attorney listed in court records, appeared Monday afternoon before a U.S. 
magistrate judge in Charleston, West Virginia. He was ordered detained pending a preliminary hearing. The article 
noted that the FBI has been investigating Miller since March 14, 2023, when agents received a tip from the West 
Virginia Securities Commission that a complaint had come in about Miller selling unregistered securities to the 
public through a company called Bear Industries LLC. 
Judge Rules to Continue Federal Case Against Girlfriend of South Carolina Killer 
WMBF (NBC-32) (08/12, Boles, Owens) reported that the federal case against the longtime girlfriend of Brittanee 
Drexel's killer was continued. A federal judge in Charleston ruled to continue 56-year-old Angel Vause's case on 
Monday. Vause previously agreed to plead guilty to two counts of making a false statement to a federal agent 
Monday afternoon. In the courtroom, new information came to light that would change the length of a potential 
sentence for Vause. That information concerned different guidelines from another federal district regarding those 
charges which would bring her maximum sentence to 16 years as opposed to 10. Vause previously faced five years 
on each of her counts, but now faces eight on each count based on the new information. The article stated 
that Vause's attorney then asked for a 10-day continuance to decide whether or not she wanted to take the plea 
deal or move forward with a trial. If she chooses to move forward with a trial, it would begin in the fall. The article 
noted that in May 2022, Vause's boyfriend, Raymond Moody, confessed to law enforcement that he and Vause 
picked up Drexel on April 25, 2009. Drexel was walking down the street, and Moody asked her if she wanted to 
party and smoke marijuana. The three ended up at a campsite in Georgetown County, where Moody kidnapped, 
raped and killed the teenager. Her remains were found in the Harmony Township area over a decade later. Vause 
talked with the FBI around May 11, 2022, and told an agent she went to pick up keys during the killing but was 
driving in another direction for a different reason, court documents state. She also said that Drexel kept her cell 
phone when the FBI alleges Vause took Drexel's phone and dumped it between Georgetown and Charleston 
counties. Vause added that Drexel voluntarily joined her and Moody, but the FBI said Drexel was actually abducted 
"under false pretenses." 
FBI Investigating Addiction Treatment Provider That Partners With Kentucky Jail 
The Cincinnati Enquirer (08/12, Baarlaer) reported that a prominent addiction treatment provider that recently 
formed a partnership with the Kenton County Detention Center is under investigation for healthcare fraud by the 
FBI's Louisville division, according to a request for information on the FBI's website. Addiction Recovery Care, also 
known as ARC, is the organization at the center of the FBI's investigation. The for-profit organization based in 
Louisa, Kentucky, operates more than 30 licensed addiction treatment centers across Kentucky, including 
an outpatient center in Crestview Hills. The article stated that the FBI's request for information, which was 
published on July 30, asks people to fill out a questionnaire if they believe they were "victimized by ARC or have 
information relevant to this investigation." ARC is not facing criminal charges at this time, according to the FBI's
