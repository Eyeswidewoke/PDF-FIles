available for management's discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments 
and debt service requirements. The presentation of Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be 
considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted Net
