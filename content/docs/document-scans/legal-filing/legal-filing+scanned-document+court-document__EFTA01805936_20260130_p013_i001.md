These myths are both ill founded and dangerous. III founded because, to be quite honest, we aren't that smart and, 
therefore, sometimes blunder. And dangerous because they all too often given birth to fantastic conspiracy theories in 
an effort to make sense out of the disastrous consequences of American policy mistakes. 
Both of these myths, after having been given a real run in conversations about the horrific war in Iraq, are again on full 
display in analyses of US policies towards Egypt and Syria. In discussions about both situations, assumptions are made 
that American policies are informed and intentional with the resultant consequences having been anticipated. 
In the case of Egypt, one line of thought begins with "America supported the Muslim Brotherhood". As it is developed, 
the argument is made that the US saw (or hoped for) the creation of a "Sunni crescent" in the Middle East as a check 
against Iran and its allies. 
As evidence for this assumption, some point to the simple fact that President Barack Obama recognised the elected 
Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi, and continued US assistance programmes to Egypt. Adherents of this 
view believe that their case gets stronger when they note that in the lead up to Tamarod (the Rebel campaign that 
spearheaded the 30 June demonstrations), the US Ambassador to Egypt addressed a public gathering in which she 
actively discouraged demonstrations, suggesting that political activists should, instead, strengthen opposition political 
parties and prepare for the next election. A few days later, the ambassador paid a visit to the Muslim Brotherhood 
headquarters to meet with the group's leader. 
Then, after the military deposed Morsi, the US administration didn't immediately embrace the transition and instead 
sent a high-ranking State Department official to urge reconciliation and political compromise. Case closed. 
The reality, however, was far more complex. One the one hand, it was entirely reasonable for the US to attempt to work 
with the elected government of the largest and most strategically important Arab country. America has important 
interests to protect in the region and sees peace, stability, and progress in Egypt as a key component to those interests. 
It might also be seen as reasonable that a US official would caution against potentially destabilising demonstrations and, 
for the same reason, after the military action of 3 July, urge the parties to seek some level of accommodation and a 
restoration of civil order. 
Where fault can be found is with American intelligence failing to understand the depth of Egyptian frustration with the 
Morsi government and the degree to which its agenda had alienated the population. The bottom line is that as difficult 
as it may be for those who would rather comfort themselves with the certainty of myths and conspiracy theories, 
America didn't have a clue what was going on in Egypt and was operating blind and on autopilot. No conspiracy, just 
mistakes in an effort to protect interests. 
I have also been struck by the myths playing out in reaction to the admittedly awkward scenario that developed over the 
threats to bomb, then not bomb, Syria. It wasn't the "America's smart" myth that played out here; it was myth of 
"America, the all-powerful". I have heard too many members and supporters of the Syrian opposition express the 
conviction that America could, if it wanted to, "take out" Bashar Al-Assad and end his regime. They were, at first, 
disappointed that the US administration only intended to teach Al-Assad's government a lesson. They wanted much 
more. But it was never on the cards that America would play the role of deus ex machina. Their expectations, from the 
outset, were too high and, frankly speaking, not reality-based. 
President Obama was hesitant to act without UN — or at the very least NATO — support. Even the US military command 
was not supportive. And then there is the fact that in the dysfunctional hyper-partisan world of Washington politics, 
Congress had to be considered. This is the same Congress that has voted over 30 times to defund healthcare reform, the 
president's signature legislative victory, and still can't agree to pass a budget or keep the nation from defaulting on its 
debt. This Congress would have eaten him alive had he bucked their will and gone to war without their acquiescence. 
An additional restraint that must be factored into this discussion is the war-weariness of the American people. The 
notion that if America would "just help the Syrian opposition win" ignores the question "then what?" Since it is clear
