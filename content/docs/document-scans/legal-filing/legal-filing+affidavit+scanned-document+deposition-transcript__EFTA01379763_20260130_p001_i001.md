taken as a whole, to comply with this prescriptive norm, the firm's statements to its various 
stakeholders would have to express in over-determined fashion how each of the firm's 
stakeholders stand to benefit or are exposed to risk by corporate decisions. 
Courts could enforce this standard only in the limited ways that they presently enforce 
fiduciary discourse standards owed to shareholders. While courts could not enforce 
substantive standards or impose liability for "bad" decisions for fear of undermining the 
authority and discretion of the board of directors, the overarching obligation of candor, 
completeness and good-faith is one that courts can and do undertake to enforce on behalf 
of shareholders through the mechanisms of shareholder derivative suits under state law. 
The fiduciary discourse obligation could similarly be enforced on behalf of other 
stakeholders through "stakeholder derivative" suits to enforce directors' obligations to 
them. "€* Or the standard might be enforced by ex ["2211 tending the reach of the federal 
securities laws to non-shareholding stakeholders. 
2. Integrity in Firm Governance 
As noted above, since the 1930s corporate law scholars have for the most part been 
pre-occupied with the "agency problem" in corporate law. -4* One of the most prominent 
contemporary analysts of the agency problem, Michael Jensen, has late in his career 
come to the conclusion that the traditional agency problem has been well-enough solved. 
'99 Jensen, working with co-authors Werner H. Erhard and Steve Zaffron, asserts that the 
more pressing contemporary problem of unrealized corporate value relates not to failures 
in the principal-agent relationship, but rather failures in the more intimate relationship 
between the agent and herself. Jensen refers to this as the problem of "integrity"-or the 
lack of integrity, in the life of the agent. What is of particular interest to the present inquiry 
is Jensen's conclusion that the "integrity" of corporate agents can be improved through the 
adoption r222J of a different kind of discourse norm than presently prevails in corporate 
speech. "99
By integrity, Jensen means wholeness, completeness, and coherence. 9' People or 
systems that lack integrity always underperform, sometimes catastrophically. '4* He argues 
that things, processes, individuals, and relationships all have more "workability" when they 
operate with integrity. Critics may argue that Jensen's new project differs little from familiar 
concepts of efficiency and that all that is new here is a proposal to pursue a presently 
underappreciated approach to efficiency gains. This critique is almost inevitable given 
Jensen's insistence that his program of integrity is not a normative guidepost but an 
agnostic map of "workability." ^99 Others might reasonably think that while it is nice to have 
Jensen in the conversation, work on the relationship between integrity and productivity has 
been a long-standing theme in progressive-especially feminist-corporate theory. rim I 
nevertheless think Jensen's work is valuable as an illustration of this Article's claim that 
discourse norms can be instrumentally deployed to achieve desired results in corporate 
operations. 
Jensen argues that the best way that individuals and relationships can operate with 
integrity is through people living by their "word." To be a person of integrity a person must 
honor their word. Now, for Jensen, honoring one's word is not the same as keeping one's 
word. To keep one's word means to do or not do exactly what you say you will. But only a 
person with a very small life, and very few responsibilities, could possibly keep their word
