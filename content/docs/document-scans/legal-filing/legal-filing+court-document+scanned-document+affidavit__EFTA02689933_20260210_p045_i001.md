25.2 
Before making an investment decision with respect to Shares of any Class in any Compartment, 
prospective investors should carefully consider all of the information set out in this Memorandum and 
the relevant Special Section, as well as their own personal circumstances. Investors should have 
particular regard to, among other matters, the considerations set out in this Section and under the 
heading "Specific risk factors" in the relevant Special Section. The risk factors referred to therein, and 
in this document, alone or collectively, may reduce the return on the Shares of any Compartment and 
could result in the loss of all or a proportion of an Investor's investment in the Shares of any 
Compartment. The price of the Shares of any Compartment can go down as well as up and their value 
is not guaranteed. Investors may not receive, at redemption or liquidation, the amount that they 
originally invested in any Class or any amount at all. 
25.3 
The risks may include or relate to equity markets, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, 
counterparty risk, market volatility and political risks. The risk factors set out in the General Section 
and the relevant Special Section are not exhaustive. There may be other risks that a prospective 
investor should consider that are relevant to its own particular circumstances or generally. 
25.4 
An investment in the Shares of any Compartment is only suitable for investors who (either alone or in 
conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and 
risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may 
result therefrom. 
25.5 
Before making any investment decision with respect to the Shares, prospective investors should 
consult their own stockbroker, bank manager, lawyer, solicitor, accountant and/or financial adviser 
and carefully review and consider such an investment decision in the light of the foregoing and the 
prospective investor's personal circumstances. 
Conflicts of interest 
25.6 
The General Partner, any Manager, the Investment Adviser or any member of an Investment 
Committee may be engaged in other business activities in addition to managing and providing advice 
to the Company (or the relevant Compartment). It is possible that companies with whom they are 
associated or which they manage or advise invest by way of co-investment or otherwise in the same 
issues, placements and investments as the Company (or the relevant Compartment), and under the 
same or similar conditions. It is also possible that such associated companies may have already 
invested in these assets or may invest into such assets at a later stage. However, the General Partner, 
any Manager. the Investment Adviser or any member of an Investment Committee will be obliged to 
devote such part of their professional time and attention to the business of the Company (or the 
relevant Compartment) as is reasonably required in the best interest of the Company (and the relevant 
Compartment) and its Investors in order to effectively manage the Company (and the relevant 
Compartment). Investment opportunities which are suitable for the Company (and the relevant 
Compartment) and other accounts managed or advised by the General Partner, a relevant Manager and 
the relevant Investment Adviser will be allocated as between the Company and such other accounts in 
the reasonable discretion of the General Partner. 
25.7 
Certain Investors may, directly or indirectly through an Affiliate, hold shares in the General Partner, an 
Investment or a participation in the Investment Adviser and therefore have an incentive to take a 
decision which follows other interests as those of the Company (or of a relevant Compartment). 
25.8 
Investors may have conflicting investment, tax, regulatory and other interests with respect to their 
Commitment. As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by 
the General Partner or the relevant Investment Adviser, including with respect to the nature or 
structuring of Investments, that may be more beneficial for one Investor than for another Investor. In
