• CSIS: The Impossible State Live Podcast: Slow Boil: What to Expect from the DPRK in 2024— Monday, January 
29, 2024. Location: Online Event, 11:00 AM. Though it appears things could not get any worse with Kim Jong-
un, there will likely be an uptick in North Korean belligerence in 2024. CSIS data shows North Korea tends to 
ramp up provocations in U.S. election years. Please join the Impossible State podcast for a special discussion 
on what to expect from North Korea in 2024. The conversation will be moderated by Dr. Ellen Kim and 
feature Dr. Victor Cha, Senior Vice President and Korea Chair at CSIS. During this episode, Dr. Kim and Dr. Cha 
will discuss the Korea Chair's latest publication, Slow Boil: What to Expect from the DPRK in 2024, and more. 
• AEI: US International Trade Policy and the Agricultural Sector in 2024 and Beyond — Monday, January 29, 
2024. Location: AEI, 1:00 PM. The past seven years have left the US trade agenda in shambles. The Trump 
administration reversed a 75-year trend toward more-open global markets—pulling the US out of the Trans-
Pacific Partnership, crippling the World Trade Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement Body, imposing 
supplemental tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, and plunging the US in a costly trade war with China. 
Hopes that the Biden administration would be better were short-lived. Supplemental tariffs remain in place, 
and minimal progress has been made toward WTO reform. Looking ahead to the presidential election, now-
candidate Donald Trump promises to impose a 10 percent tariff on all foreign imports, putting US agriculture 
at risk of retaliatory actions by major trading partners. Join AEI scholars and a panel of experts as they 
analyze what to expect in 2024 and beyond. 
• Atlantic Council: How Ukraine fights Russian disinformation: Beehive vs mammoth — Monday, January 29, 
2024. Location: Online Event, 9:00 AM. In 2023, the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid 
Threats and the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab interviewed two dozen Ukrainian officials 
and experts leading the country's efforts to counter Russian information operations. The result is a 
groundbreaking new report documenting how they've been doing it, what's working, and their advice for 
Western governments also facing Russian information threats. This event, featuring report co-authors Jakub 
Kalensky* and Roman Osadchuk, will discuss the main lessons learned by Ukraine over the last decade, and 
explore how Ukraine's resilience can serve as a model for Europe and elsewhere. 
• Atlantic Council: War in Sudan: Risks of  prolonged conflict and regional instability— Monday, January 29, 
2024. Location: Online Event, 9:00 AM. After nearly ten months of fighting in Sudan, civilians remain caught 
in the middle of devastating conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid 
Support Forces (RSF). As the crisis continues, global concerns about widespread internal displacement and 
potential ethnic cleansing are on the rise. In fits and starts, regional leaders have attempted to mediate 
between the SAF and RSF: For example, the African Union recently formed a panel tasked with helping 
Sudan restore peace. But a ceasefire remains elusive. With outside actors supporting, arming, and 
resupplying different sides in the conflict, the potential for continued violence and a human rights disaster 
remains high. Join us for a panel with high-level experts discussing the war in Sudan and pathways towards 
peace on Monday, January 29, at 9 a.m. Et

entrepreneurs of all backgrounds to build and thrive in a dynamic environment. In 2021, women's 
participation in the technology sector in Saudi Arabia was recorded at 28 percent, higher than the European 
average of 17.5 percent and a significant increase from previous years.
