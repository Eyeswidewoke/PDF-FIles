these conclusions largely based on the files of Gelli and his close associates, but most of those 
named in them denied any such membership in Gelli's secret lodge. Nor did his P-2 lodge ever 
hold meetings or conduct ordinary Masonic business, as is prescribed by Freemasonry. Whether 
any of powerful individuals were actually members of P-2. or whether the lists were part of a 
con game staged by Gelli, as long as people believed it existed, it provided a highly-profitable 
clearing-house for businessmen interested in buying influence or protection from government 
officials. For these transaction, Gelli acted as the go-between, deal-maker and record-keeper. In 
Calvi's case, Gelli extracted a heavy price from Calvi for arranging political protection (which, 
as it turns out, was never delivered.) 
In accordance with Gelli's instructions Calvi transferred $21 million to a South American 
bank. Supposedly, Calvi later told three magistrates investigating the P-2 lodge, Gelli was 
funneling the money through intermediaries to top officials of Italy's Socialist Party who 
presumably would intervene with bank regulators on the behalf of the Banco Ambrosiano. 
There were also much larger diversions that he elected not to tell the magistrates about. In 1982, 
Juerg Heer, the executive director of the credit section of Zurich's powerful Rothschild Bank, 
witnessed some extraordinary transfers from Calvi's Luxembourg subsidiary to a Gelli-controlled 
corporate shell in Panama called Bellatrix. According to Heer, these loans, which amounted to 
$142 million, were temporarily deposited by Bellatrix at the Rothschild Bank, which then were 
used by Bellatrix to buy shares in Rizzoli at ten times their market value from Gelli and his 
associates. By this trick almost 90 percent of the $142 million of the Bank Ambrosiano loan 
went into the pockets of Gelli and his associates, according to Heer. This diversion became so 
blatant by the Spring of 1982, that the Rothschild Bank director assisting Bellatrix warned Heer, 
"we have to find a solution or I will end up in Lake Zurich." The solution Heer found was to 
temporarily put the Bellatrix money into two different accounts at the bank. One was called 
Zirka; the other Reciota. They both supposedly were controlled by an independent fiduciary 
agent. Nevertheless, the money was release into other numbered accounts controlled by Gelli, 
and disappeared. All that Calvi's Luxembourg subsidiary had as collateral was the Rizzoli 
shares, which were now worth only a small fraction of the money it loaned. Making matters 
worse for Calvi, Italian law had been changed in 1982 so as block the transfer of these Rizzoli 
shares to the bank's Luxembourg subsidiary. So Calvi informed Gelli that the Rizzoli deal had 
not been consummated and that the $142 million loaned to the Gelli entities still belonged to his 
bank. According to Calvi's personal assistant, as late as June 1982, Calvi counted on this 
diverted money as a "reserve fund," and part of Calvi's purpose in secretly slipping out of Italy 
in 1982 was to get the Bank Rothschild in Zurich to return the Bellatrix money from the 
numbered accounts. It was a destination he never reached. 
The only further instructions Heer received in Zurich came from one of Gelli's associates 
shortly after Calvi's body was identified. According to Heer, he was requested to carry out a 
"secret operation." It involved some $5 million in cash packed in a suitcase which was delivered 
to him at the Rothschild Bank. The money supposedly had come from one of Gelli's numbered 
accounts in Geneva. He also received, along with the suitcase ,one-half of a $100 bill. 
Following Gelli's associate's instructions, he gave the suitcase to two strangers who later arrived 
at the bank with the matching half of the bill, and who left with the suitcase in an armored 
limousine. 
Less than three months later, on September 13, 1982, Gelli was arrested in Switzerland after 
making a $55 million withdrawal from the same numbered account in Geneva. The subsequent
