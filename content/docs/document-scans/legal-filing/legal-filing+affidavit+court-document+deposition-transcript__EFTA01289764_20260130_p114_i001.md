Important Information and Disclosures 
Pricing 
This section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis. including short positions, at the close of the statement period. The market prices have been obtained from 
sources which we believe to be reliable. Pershing may not use the dosing price of the particular exchange or marketplace where your position was purchased as the 'Market Price.' Securities for which a price is 
not available are marked "N/A" and are omitted from the Total. 
The estimated annual income (EAI) and estimated current yield (ECY) figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. These figures are not considered to be a forecast or guarantee of future results. 
These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable; however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, 
and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position 
quantities. interest and dividend rates. and prices remain constant A capital gain or return of principal may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to 
www.pershing.corn/business_continuity.htrri for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received.

reduced by the amount of shares on loan. The Proxy Voting Instruction Form sent to you may reflect a smaller number of shares entitled to vote than the number of shares in your margin account.
