Shares pertaining to a Class of shares may be further sub-divided in series of shares that will be considered for

Compartment, the Company shall redeem all the shares in the Class(es) of shares of that Compartment, in 
accordance with article 8. At each extension of the duration of a Compartment, the registered shareholders will 
be duly notified in writing by a notice sent to their address as recorded in the Company's register of 
shareholders. The Memorandum shall indicate whether a Compartment is incorporated for an unlimited period of 
time or, alternatively, its duration and, if applicable, any extension of its duration and the terms and conditions 
for such extension.
