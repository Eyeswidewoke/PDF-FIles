Focus Europe: Dark clouds, no storm yet 
The Week Ahead' Hest of Europe 2, the USA 
• In the US, Fed chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee will be 
the key highlight for the week. In terms of data releases, it will be a relatively quiet week, with January retail sales 
being the focal point. Our US teem expects retail sales to improve 0.3% mom at the start of the year. Other releases 
include JOLTS opening, business inventory and wholesale inventory for December and consumer sentiment (prelim) 
for February. 
• In the UK, trade statistics, industrial production and construction output for December will be the key data to watch. 
An improvement in the oil balance dominated November trade data; we expect further slight reduction in the trade 
deficit in December. Industrial activity disappointed in November, and warmer-than-usual weather in December 
could mean further weakness; we expect IP to fall 0.3% mom in December. In GEE, prelim Q4-15 GDP will be 
released in Poland, Romania and Hungary.
