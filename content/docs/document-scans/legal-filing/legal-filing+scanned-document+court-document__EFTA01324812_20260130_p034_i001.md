UBS Client Relationship Agreement 
34 
We have the right to satisfy a margin call or to obtain full or partial payment of a margin 
loan at any time without a demand for margin or additional margin or other notice. To 
satisfy a margin call or to obtain full or partial payment of the margin loan, in addition to 
all rights provided by law, we have the right to: 
1. 
require additional collateral, 
2. 
sell any Property in any of your Accounts with us, whether carried individually or 
jointly with others, 
3. 
buy any Property which may be held short in your Account, 
4. 
cancel any open orders and close any or all outstanding contracts, or 
5. 
liquidate any of your Accounts with us. 
We may also exercise these rights if in our discretion we consider it necessary for your or 
our protection; if a bankruptcy petition, or petition for the appointment of a receiver, is 
filed by or against you; if an attachment is levied against any Account; or in the event of 
your death or dissolution. 
You understand that there are substantial risks involved in trading securities on 
margin, using leverage as a liquidity source or as part of your investment strategy, 
or otherwise pledging your securities in order to obtain credit. Please review the 
Loan Disclosure Statement included in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet 
carefully for a detailed discussion of these risks. 
Security Interest 
As security for the payment of all liabilities or indebtedness presently outstanding or to be 
incurred under this or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including but 
not limited to any loans or promissory notes, you hereby grant to each UBS Entity a security 
interest in and lien on any and all Property held or carried by any UBS Entity for you or on 
your behalf in or credited to any UBS Account(s) (other than qualified plan or IRA accounts 
or other accounts where doing so would be a prohibited transaction or violation of 
applicable law or regulation) and in any other Account with any UBS Entity in which you 
may have any legal, equitable or other interest. 
All such Property will be subject to such security interest as collateral for the discharge of 
your obligations to any UBS Entity, wherever or however arising and without regard to 
whether or not we made loans with respect to that Property. In enforcing our security 
interest, we have the discretion to determine the amount, order and manner in which the 
Property will be sold and have all the rights and remedies available to a secured party 
under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in addition to all other rights provided in this 
Agreement or by law. 
You will not cause or allow any of the Property held in any of your UBS Accounts, whether 
owned now or acquired later, to be or become subject to any liens, security interests, 
mortgages or encumbrances of any nature other than our security interest, without our 
prior written consent. Each UBS Entity shall act as agent for and on behalf of each UBS 
Entity for purposes of perfecting, maintaining and enforcing the security interests granted 
hereunder or by operation of law. Each UBS Entity acting in the capacity of a deposit bank, 
securities intermediary or commodities intermediary, agrees to follow the instructions and 
entitlement orders of each other UBS Entity with respect to the Property as a secured party 
without further consent by you. You hereby authorize and direct each UBS Entity to follow 
the instructions and entitlement orders of each other UBS Entity.
