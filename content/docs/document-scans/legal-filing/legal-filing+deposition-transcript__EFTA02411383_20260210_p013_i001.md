Even those governments that are tempted to keep stimulating the economy may find that the markets punish 
them for it. Once a crisis of confidence has occurred, governments find it difficult to raise the money they need at 
an acceptable interest rate. A report by an economic adviser to the Bank for International Settlements in March 
noted that "our projections of public debt ratios lead us to conclude that the path pursued by fiscal authorities in a 
number of industrial countries is unsustainable. Drastic measures are necessary to check the rapid growth of 
current and future liabilities of governments and reduce their adverse consequences for long-term growth and 
monetary stability." 
Countries that decide to embark on deficit reduction may face another problem. According to Andrew Smithers of 
Smithers & Co, a consultancy, a debt-cutting policy will make it harder for the government to bail out the private 
sector in times of need, as well as reducing companies' cashflow by imposing higher taxes. 
An even bigger problem may be the unfunded liabilities that government face from ageing populations. This is a 
double burden: benefits for growing numbers of pensioners will have to be paid for by a shrinking band of 
workers. These liabilities are difficult to calculate. Pierre Cailleteau of Moody's, a rating agency, says that "the 
state of public-finance accounting is extremely rudimentary relative to private-sector accounting." 
A 2009 report by Jagadeesh Gokhale, of the right-wing Cato Institute in Washington, DC, estimated that the 
average EU country would need a fund worth 434% of its GDP, earning interest at the government's borrowing 
rate, to meet such liabilities; alternatively, it would need to save 8.3% of its GDP each year. Neither seems 
realistic. The only answer is to cut future benefits. But the elderly form a powerful voting block, with a higher 
turnout than their children, who will pay the bill. 
European extremes 
Neither Greece nor Iceland has had any choice about tackling its deficits. They may be a long way apart, both 
geographically and culturally, but both are casualties of the debt crisis. Iceland was the little country that could. A 
land with just 300,000 people, best known for its volcanoes and its fish, it privatised its banks and suddenly 
became an international financial powerhouse. "In the Icelandic system, all the banks were aggressive broker-
dealers like Bear Stearns and Lehman," says Asgeir Jonsson, an economist and author of a book, "Why Iceland?". 
A high exchange rate encouraged its corporate sector to go on an overseas acquisition spree. Its housing market 
boomed as fishermen took out cheap loans in euros and yen. The country became an egregious example of the 
excesses of financial liberalisation. Its politicians failed to halt its debt spiral because its citizens (and particularly 
its elite) seemed to be doing well out of the boom. Houses doubled in price, the strong krona allowed its people to 
go shopping in London and its billionaires to buy British retailers and football clubs. 
Greece, for its part, was not noted for an aggressive banking sector or a housing boom. It was traditionally 
dismissed by investors as a country of high inflation and repeated devaluations. When it joined the euro zone in 
2001 it reaped an immediate dividend in lower interest rates, but it failed to tackle its underlying problems. 
Dodgy accounting disguised the size of its government debt. Its businesses remained uncompetitive, causing a 
large trade deficit. The economy is riddled with inefficiencies and restrictive practices. For example, cruise ships 
are not allowed to take on new passengers at Greek ports, and the number of lorry licences is still the same as in 
1990 even though GDP has doubled. Such restrictive practices are keeping transport costs too high. According to 
Yannis Stournaras of IOBE, a think-tank, it is cheaper to transport goods to Athens from Italy than from Thebes, 
just 32 miles away. 
Greece is an exemplar of the flaws in the European welfare model. The state gets remorselessly bigger because 
political parties of the right and left have bought votes by providing supporters with jobs or subsidies. Antonis 
Kamaris of Levant Partners, an investment group, says the state must "remove benefits that have built up like a 
ship accumulates barnacles". Public-sector workers were mollycoddled with pay for 13 or 14 months per year and 
arcane allowances for things like firewood or carrying files between office floors. 
Tax evasion is widespread. A report by the London School of Economics estimates that it reduced Greece's
