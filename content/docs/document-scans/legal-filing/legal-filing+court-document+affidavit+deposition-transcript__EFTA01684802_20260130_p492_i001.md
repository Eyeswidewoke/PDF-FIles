Detail of Changes to Your Cardmember Agreement 
This notice amends the Cardmember Agreement (the "Agreement") as described below. We have the right 
to amend the Agreement. Any terms in the Agreement conflicting with this change are replaced fully and 
completely. Terms not changed by this notice remain in full force and effect. We encourage you to read this 
notice, share it with Additional Cardmembers on your account, and file it for future reference. If you have any 
questions about this change, please call the number on the back of your Card. 
p. 819 
Using the Card 
Effective August 15, 2016, in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement, we are amending the Using the card sub-
section of the About using your card section by deleting the fourth paragraph (including the bullet points) and the 
fifth paragraph in their entirety and replacing them with the following: 
You may arrange for certain merchants and third parties to store your card number and expiration date, so 
that, for example: 
• the merchant may charge your account at regular intervals; or 
• you may make charges using that stored card information. 
We may (but are not required to) tell these merchants and third parties if your expiration date or card 
number changes or if your account status is updated, including if your account is cancelled. You must 
notify the merchants and third parties directly if you want them to stop charging your Account. 
Converting charges made in a foreign currency 
Effective August 15, 2016, in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement, we are amending the Converting charges 
made in a foreign currency sub-section in the Other important information section by deleting the text in its 
entirety and replacing it with: 
If you make a charge in a foreign currency, AE Exposure Management Ltd. ("AEEML") will convert it into 
U.S. dollars on the date we or our agents process it, so that we bill you for the charge in U.S. dollars based 
upon this conversion. Unless a particular rate is required by law, AEEML will choose a conversion rate that 
is acceptable to us for that date. The rate AEEML uses is no more than the highest official rate published 
by a government agency or the highest interbank rate AEEML identifies from customary banking sources 
on the conversion date or the prior business day. This rate may differ from rates that are in effect on the 
date of your charge. We will bill charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) at the rates they 
use. 
Closing your Account 
Effective September 1, 2016, in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement, we are amending the Closing your 
Account sub-section in the Other important information section by inserting a new paragraph at the end of the 
sub-section: 
If an Annual Membership fee applies, we will refund this fee if you notify us that you are voluntarily closing 
your Account within 30 days of the Closing Date of the billing statement on which that fee appears. 
For cancellations after this 30 day period, the Annual Membership fee is non-refundable. If an Annual 
Membership fee applies to your Account, it is shown on page 1 and page 2 of Part 1 of the Cardmember 
Agreement. 
If your billing address is in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the time you close your account, this 
policy will not apply to you.
