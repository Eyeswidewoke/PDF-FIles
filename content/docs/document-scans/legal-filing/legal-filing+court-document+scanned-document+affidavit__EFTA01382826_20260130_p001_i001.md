condensed consolidating financial statements related primarily to 2008 and 2009. The Company does not believe these errors were material. The 
adjustments are limited to the guarantor footnote and do not affect any other reported amounts or disclosures in the Company's consolidated 
financial statements. The Company also connected its accounting for debt transactions as described in Note 6 "Borrowings" of these consolidated 
financial statements. 
During the third quarter of 2014. the senior secured loan facilities were amended and three subsidiaries were removed as guarantors. 
Although these changes were not material and did not have an impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company adjusted 
prior periods to align with the new guarantor structure. These adjustments are limited to the guarantor footnote and do not affect any other reported 
amounts or disclosures in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 6 "Borrowings- of these consolidated financial 
statements for additional information on the private placement.
