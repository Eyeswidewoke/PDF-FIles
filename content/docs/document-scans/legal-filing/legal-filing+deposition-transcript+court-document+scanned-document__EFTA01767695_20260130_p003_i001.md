July 6 —JERUSALEM -- Whatever else that might be said about the Arab revolutions, it's obvious that they pose a 
problem for Israel. But how bad, and what should the Israeli government do to hedge its risks? I heard some interesting 
— but not very encouraging — ideas on this subject from top government officials last week. 
To sum up: Most officials think that relations with the Arabs are gradually going to get worse, perhaps for 
decades, before democracy really takes root and the Arab public, perhaps, will be ready to accept the Jewish state. The 
challenge for Israel is how to avoid inflaming Arab public opinion, a newly important factor, while protecting the 
country. 
The trouble ahead is symbolized by the election of Mohamed Morsi 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_eastimorsi-named-new-egyptian-
president/2012/06/24/g1QAMZaazV_story.html> , a Muslim Brotherhood leader, as president of Egypt. His inauguration 
chttp://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/islamist-morsi-is-sworn-in-as-president-of-
egypt/2012/06/30/gJQA84vZDW_story.html> prompted a wary message of congratulation from Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu, expressing hope that -Israeli-Egyptian relations will be cooperative and based on mutual interest. 
The statement masked deep Israeli anxieties. 
Netanyahu fears an erosion of the relationship with Egypt over time and wants to slow that process, if possible, 
while preparing for potential trouble. Netanyahu is said to view these precautions as the equivalent of putting up 
shutters before a storm. 
The most obvious test will be Gaza, where the militant Hamas leadership is closely allied with the Muslim 
Brotherhood. Netanyahu has tried to de-escalate crises that have arisen, but if rocket attacks increase, they may draw a 
harsh Israeli military reaction — which could worsen relations with Cairo. 
Efraim Halevy, the former Mossad chief, says Israel should face reality and begin talking with Hamas. But others 
stress the growing threat in Gaza: Israel has intelligence that militants there have tried to buy shoulder-fired anti-aircraft 
missiles from Libya, and the Israeli air force now operates on the assumption that such missiles are present in Gaza, in 
addition to the array of other rockets. 
The Sinai Peninsula is another flash point. This vast desert is becoming a lawless area where al-Qaeda and other 
terrorist groups are trying to find a haven. Intelligence officials here believe the extremists' strategy is to provoke an 
Israeli retaliation and thereby encourage an unraveling of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty. I didn't hear any clear formula 
for how Israel can respond to attacks without falling into this trap. 
The chill in Israel's relationship with Turkey adds to the dangers of instability in Egypt, Libya and Syria. 
Netanyahu has responded by seeking new allies, including: 
• A "Balkan arc" anchored by newly closer relations with Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania. Some 
of those countries allow the Israeli air force to train in their airspace, providing an alternative to the now-unfriendly 
skies over Turkey. 
• An implicit, if unspoken, alliance with Saudi Arabia and other gulf states against Iran and against Muslim 
Brotherhood extremism. In this silent courtship, the Israelis are offering an alternative to an America that's no longer 
seen as a reliable protector of the conservative gulf regimes. 
• New links with governments in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Kenya, Uganda and the Ivory Coast, which are 
worried that the rise of militant Islam in North Africa will spread south.
