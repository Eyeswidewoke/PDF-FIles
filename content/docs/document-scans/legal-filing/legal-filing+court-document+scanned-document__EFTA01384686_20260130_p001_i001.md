HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
If the Management Company decides, based on the factors set forth above, to execute over-
the-counter transactions on an agency basis through Electronic Communications Networks 
("ECNs"), it will also consider the following factors when choosing to use one ECN over another: 
the ease of use; the flexibility of the ECN compared to other ECNs; and the level of care and 
attention that will be given to smaller orders. 
The Management Company maintains policies and procedures to review the quality of 
executions, including periodic reviews by its investment professionals. 
Soft Dollars 
From time to time, the Management Company may pay a broker-dealer commissions (or 
markups or markdowns with respect to certain types of riskless principal transactions) for effecting 
Underlying Fund transactions in excess of that which another broker-dealer might have charged 
for effecting the transaction in recognition of the value of the brokerage and research services 
provided by the broker-dealer. In certain cases, such arrangements, although all related to the 
Management Company's administration and investment management of an Underlying Fund, may 
fall outside of the safe harbor for fiduciaries' use of "soft dollar" services established by Section 
28(e) of the Exchange Act ("Section 28(e)"); provided, in each case, that the Management 
Company believes that these arrangements are equitable and consistent with the objectives of such 
Underlying Fund. As of the date of this Memorandum, there are no arrangements whereby the 
Management Company has committed any of the Underlying Funds to pay a certain level of 
commissions (or markups or markdowns) in exchange for any "soft dollar" or other services from 
any broker dealer. 
In addition, the Third-Party Ventures in which the Partnership may participate, may make 
use of "soft dollar" services, and any additional transaction expenses incurred in order to obtain 
such services—unlike in the case of any "soft dollar" services obtained by the Management 
Company—would generally constitute incremental expenses to the Partnership. Such "soft dollar" 
services may also fall outside of the "safe harbor" provisions of Section 28(e). Each Limited 
Partner, as a condition of investing in the Partnership, consents to such "soft dollar" arrangements 
and, if applicable, to the Management Company consenting to such arrangements on behalf of the 
Partnership. 
Also, consistent with Section 28(e), research products or services obtained with "soft 
dollars" generated by an Underlying Fund may be used by the Management Company to service 
one or more Other Accounts, including Accounts that may not have paid for the soft dollar benefits. 
Although the Management Company currently has no arrangements whereby any of its Accounts 
are receiving soft dollar credits, if it obtains them in the future, the Management Company will 
not be required to seek to allocate soft dollar benefits to Accounts in proportion to the soft dollar 
credits the Accounts generate. Where a product or service obtained with soft dollars provides both 
research and non-research assistance to the Management Company (i.e., a "mixed use" item), the 
Management Company will make a good faith allocation of the cost which may be paid for with 
soft dollars. In making good faith allocations of costs between administrative benefits and research 
and brokerage services, a conflict of interest may exist by reason of the Management Company's 
allocation of the costs of such benefits and services between those that primarily benefit the 
Management Company and those that primarily benefit the Accounts.
