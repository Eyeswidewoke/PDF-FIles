An FDA committee has recommended that the agency deny approval for Sarepta Therapeutics new drug 
Eteplirsen, a potentially lifesaving drug for Duchenne Muscular dystrophy, a rare and invariably fatal disease that affects 
young boys. The preliminary data is very encouraging with several years of experience on the drug showing young boys 
continuing to walk and maintain function where statistics would have expected them to already be wheelchair bound. 
No significant adverse effects on safety were reported. The denial is based on the small number of subjects evaluated, 
which is to be expected when dealing with a rare disease. The panel also wants to require the pharmaceutical company 
to repeat years of study with placebo controls, an ethical conundrum when the disease is invariably progressive and 
fatal. If it were their child facing a lethal disease, we doubt that they would be willing to give their own child repeated, 
uncomfortable, and not without risk sugar water injections instead of a potentially beneficial treatment for an invariably 
fatal disease. 
The greatest irony of all however, is the proverbial unspoken giant elephant in the room. In spite of its 
insistence that the public safety is its greatest concern, the FDA has repeatedly failed to address the regulatory loophole 
in which tens of thousands of unapproved drugs remain on the marketplace. The FDA was created in 1906 but 
surprisingly was not required to assess drug safety and efficacy until 1938. It began to do so in that year, but in 
deference to the financial benefit of industry over public health and safety, grandfathered all existing drugs from 
requiring FDA overview. It allowed them to remain on the marketplace purely to avoid imposing a financial burden on 
industry to prove that the products they were marketing were safe and effective. 
In 1962, Congress passed amendments to the 1938 law, to require manufacturers to show that their 
drug products were effective, as well as safe. As a result, all drugs approved between 1938 and 1962 were to be 
reviewed for effectiveness and safety, yet the FDA has repeatedly issued administrative rulings that have actually helped 
the pharmaceutical industry avoid regulatory oversight and keep these unproven products on the open market. In 2013 
the FDA announced it will continue to grant national drug code (NDC) numbers to pharmaceutical and other drug 
products not approved by FDA for a given indication. NDC's are applied to three classes of products: FDA-approved 
products, products without FDA approval for a particular claim, and products that were grandfathered in under the 1962 
Kefauver-Harris Amendments or the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Ac of 1938. The FDA itself estimates that there 
are thousands of non-approved drugs with NDC's marketed and prescribed in the US, but is unable to quantify or 
identify these products. These include drugs such as the Vitamin E product E-Ferol which was held responsible for the 
death of 40 infants in 1984, and a carbinoxamine containing drug product responsible for the deaths of 21 infants in 
2006. 
The FDA has achieved limited success in that It has removed approximately five hundred unapproved 
drugs from the marketplace since 1962. In spite of its congressional mandate, the FDA has not been able to complete its 
task of ensuring marketplace drug safety and efficacy, and in 2006 once again reaffirmed its intent to eventually do so. 
Ten years later the progress on tens of thousands of grandfathered drugs has yet to produce basic safety and efficacy 
data. The most comprehensive list of unapproved drugs is not maintained by the FDA, but rather by the National Library 
of Medicine, which identities 88,212 drugs that have been reported to the FDA. Many of these drugs are routinely 
prescribed by health care professionals and purchased by the public who are unaware of their unapproved status. 
The extent of the issue has not been quantified or publicized by the FDA but includes many commonly 
prescribed pharmaceuticals with tens of millions of unaware consumers and many billions of dollars in sales. After forty 
years of being marketed without FDA approval the manufacturer of the popular thyroid replacement drug Synthroid 
finally reluctantly agreed to safety and efficacy guidelines and was approved by the FDA in 2002. The resistance to FDA 
regulatory oversight is both financial and practical for the manufacturer. It is expensive to provide research proving that 
a drug is safe and effective is just one half of the equation. The other half is that if the drug fails to be proven safe and 
effective it will lose its market share and profitability, and open a Pandora's box of product liability lawsuits. The 
protection of public health and safety is unfortunately only a public relations interest of the manufacturer. 
In the one-hundred and ten-year history of the FDA it has studied and approved a grand total of 1,453 
drugs. A number of drugs had their approval withdrawn when safety risks were subsequently identified, leaving only 
1,246 drugs of the potentially marketed total of 88,212 remaining on the FDA approval list. In other words, over 98% of
