Jewish sovereignty to the land of Israel? What sma=l-mindedness, what weakness of character! Where would the Jews 
be now if, =n 1945, they had thought like this Arnon Lapid? Israelis would do now what=Jews always did: Grieve for their 
dead and go on, with faith and hope." =Porat would soon help usher into existence a new movement, a settlement 
en=erprise that would be self-consciously modeled on Israel's original sett=er movement, the socialist, Zionist and 
fiercely anti-religious pioneering=formations that built the original kibbutzim. The early kibbutznikim were =he men and 
women who laid the foundations for the reborn Jewish state and =ed that state through the first decades of its 
existence, but by 1973 they=appeared to be a spent force, exhausted spiritually, morally and political=y. Porat's 
movement, which would cover the biblical heartland of the Je=ish people with settlements -- a heartland the secular 
world referred to a= the West Bank, but which Jews knew by the ancient names of Judea and Sama=ia -- would be driven 
by devotion to God and his demands, not by a secular=vision of Jews liberated from the ghettoes and freed from the 
fetters of c=pitalism. 
This movement, which coalesced around Porat's Gush Emunim -- the "Bloc =f the Faithful" -- has defined Israel's political 
agenda for the past =0 years, just as the kibbutz movement and its leaders shaped Israel and it= priorities through the 
early period of its existence. What is so fascinat=ng about these two movements is that, for all their transformative 
success= they have both failed to complete their missions. The kibbutzim didn't =urn Israel into a socialist paradise, and 
the hubris and shortsightedness =f the Labor elite, which sprung from the kibbutz movement, brought Israel =ow in 
October 1973. 
And the religious-nationalist settlement movement has succeeded in moving h=ndreds of thousands of Israelis into the 
biblical heartland, but it has ne=er been able to convince the majority of Israelis that the absorption of t=e West Bank 
into a "Greater Israel" represents their country's salva=ion, rather than a threat to its existence. The thwarted 
utopianism of the=e two movements is the subject of "Like Dreamers," which is a magnific=nt book, one of the two or 
three finest books about Israel I have ever rea=. Halevi tells the story of seven men -- paratroopers who participated in 
=he liberation of Jerusalem in 1967 -- who became leaders and archetypes of=Israeli's competing utopian movements. 
When I met Halevi in New York recently, I was filled with questions about w=at this history augured for Israel's future. 
The first one to cross my min=: How did the Orthodox settlers so easily supplant the leftist kibbutz eli=e as the nation's 
pioneering vanguard? 
"The left lost its vigor at precisely the moment that religious Zionism d=scovered its own vigor," Halevi told me. "The key 
here is 1973. After =967, not much happened. There were a couple of settlements, but the Labor =overnment kept 
everyone on a tight leash, and the religious Zionists were =ntensely frustrated. The empowering moment for religious 
Zionists was due =o Labor's failures in the Yom Kippur War. A generation of young kibbutzn=kim came out of 1973 
deeply demoralized. People like Porat realized that t=e left had lost the plot." 
Halevi went on, "In Israel, you never naturally evolve from one state of =hinking to another. We careen. So we careened 
toward religious Zionism and-the settlement movement." 
But in your book, I said, you suggest that the settlers have failed to gain=legitimacy for their movement among the mass 
of Israelis. How did they fai=? 'The settlement movement failed during the first Palestinian uprising.=Israelis realized 
then the price of the occupation, that there was no such=thing, as settler leaders promised, as a benign occupation. That 
kind of i=lusion went in the late 1980s." 
Halevi noted one small irony here: If the first Palestinian uprising dispel=ed the idea that Israel could occupy the 
Palestinians cost-free and in per=etuity, the second Palestinian uprising -- which began after the peace pro=ess failed in 
2000, dispelled the left-wing argument that territorial comp=omise with the Palestinians would be easily achieved once 
Israel opened it=elf to the possibility of peace. 
"The second uprising was the end of the dream of the Peace Now movement, =ecause the worst terrorism in Israel's 
history happened after we made th= offer for real territorial compromise at Camp David, and after the Clinto= 
proposals, and after we offered to redivide Jerusalem, becoming the first=country in history to voluntarily offer shared 
sovereignty in its capital =ity." 
So, reality has discredited both the right and left. What comes next? The n=xt great ideological movement in Israeli 
history is centrism, Halevi said.="The Israeli centrist believes two things: A. the Arab world refuses to =ecognize our 
legitimacy and our existence; and B. we can't continue occu=ying them. I believe passionately that the left is correct 
about the occup=tion, and I believe the right is correct in its understanding of the inten=ions of the Middle East toward 
the Jewish state." 
I argued that "centrism" possesses neither the magnetic power of social=st transformation nor the messianic qualities 
implicit in the settlement e=terprise. Halevi disagreed. "Centrism is taking a people that hasn't f=nctioned as a people,
