General Events 
• Brookings: USMCA Forward 2025 launch: Navigating North American trade amid  global changes —
Wednesday, March 5, 2025. Location: Brookings Institution, 1:30 PM. The United States Mexico 
Canada Agreement (USMCA), negotiated during the first Donald Trump administration as a 
replacement for NAFTA, governs U.S. trade with its two largest trading partners. The USMCA is up 
for review by July 2026. This review will provide an important opportunity to take stock of the 
operation of the agreement, update it to address new issues—such as access to critical minerals, 
the transition to EVs and Al regulation—and strengthen the foundations for competition with 
China. Yet despite the opportunities that USMCA presents, the agreement's future is uncertain. 
President Trump has proposed placing 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada unless the 
countries stop flows of fentanyl and illegal migrants. Canada and Mexico have also said they will 
enact retaliatory tariffs, potentially leading to an escalating trade war. 
• CSIS: The Electricity Supply Bottleneck on U.S. Al Dominance — Wednesday, March 5, 2025. 
Location: Online event, 12:00 PM. Please join the CSIS Energy Security and Climate Change Program 
for a conversation with Vivian Lee, Managing Director and Partner at Boston Consulting Group 
(BCG) and Shanu Mathew, Portfolio Manager and Research Analyst at Lazard Asset Management. 
Vivian and Shanu will discuss the state of Al electricity demand, the implications of DeepSeek, the 
trend towards colocation, prospects for nuclear, and other key dynamics at the intersection of Al 
and electricity. Cy McGeady, Fellow with the CSIS Energy Security and Climate Change Program, will 
moderate the conversation. 
• CSIS: CSIS Report Launch: Enhancing Defense Industrial Cooperation Between Australia and the 
United States — Wednesday, March 5, 2025. Location: Online event, 5:00 PM. The United States-
Australia alliance has long been critical for maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific and advancing 
both countries' interests in the region. Over the past several years, an increasingly aggressive China 
has further reinforced the vital nature of this relationship. 
• Carnegie: Reforming  and Realigning the U.S.-Australia Alliance — Wednesday, March 5, 2025. 
Location: Online event, 4:00 PM. As the United States and Australia face an increasingly turbulent 
world, they should have an unparalleled opportunity to fashion a broader, stronger, and 
multilayered partnership. The rise of Chinese power, economic uncertainty, and technological 
disruption make strengthening this alliance an urgent priority. But despite a shared history and
