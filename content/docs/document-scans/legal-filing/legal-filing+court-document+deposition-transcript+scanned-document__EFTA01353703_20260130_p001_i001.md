arc to be made in escrow. In this case deposit of the payment due earlier on that date shall be 
made by 2:00 p.m. (local time at the place for the earlier payment if there is a time difference 
between the cities in which payments are to be made) on that date with an escrow agent selected 
by the party giving the notice and reasonably acceptable to the other party, accompanied by 
irrevocable payment instructions (i) to release the deposited payment to the intended recipient 
upon receipt by the escrow agent of the required deposit of the corresponding payment from the 
other party on the same date accompanied by irrevocable payment instructions to the same effect 
or (ii) if the required deposit of the corresponding payment is not made on that same date, to 
return the payment deposited to the party that paid it into escrow at such party's request. The 
party that elects to have payments made in escrow shall pay the costs of the escrow arrangements 
and shall cause those arrangements to provide that the intended recipient of the payment due to be 
deposited first shall be entitled to interest on that deposited payment for each day in the period of 
its deposit at the rate offered by the escrow agent for that day for overnight deposits in the 
relevant currency in the office where it holds that deposited payment (at 11:00 a.m. local time on 
that day) if that payment is not released by 5:00 p.m. local time on the date it is deposited for any 
reason other than the intended recipient's failure to make the escrow deposit it is required to make 
hereunder in a timely fashion.
