Tom report to a new person,- is. coordi=ation with Suydam Kathy Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one=person. 
The increasing public profile needs to be taken into conside=ation. 
TODAY 
With y=ur acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as = conduit directly to me) , she continued to 
provide bad info to both=C2 you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) =AO and me. and each time with my 
many annoying calls to you made immediate=y afterwards that she was g 
y !! No one was hired to run Y=UR office 
until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and ev=n now , Brad, a very nice man, is not even full time,(crazy 
) Hours=upon hours of time need to be spent training him . and his new staff. =AO Eileen followed your instructions. not 
mine. in fact she continue= to ignore mine saying " but Leon said " or " i=s on Leon's desk etc " , You would become 
frust=ated when i pointed out each instance. of her obfuscation. original=y you were given the clear choice, but to 
save money ,you chose =AO not to hire my team . I was hired to do the architecture, you kep= your own team. with 
Eileen at the head. instructions were=given by me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instance= where I 
inserted myself and personally had to do the weeks of grunt=work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in u=e? That being 
said, If you do the cold calculation ,starting=C2 from where you were, to where you are currently . you h=ve made a 
hell of a deal. -- negotiating down my o=iginal amount requested , calling upon our friendship and sugg=sting that the 
Carlyn mess was partially my fault. (=though in that specific example , I had never been asked to do more than m=rely 
provide you the name of the most highly recognized =tty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again =AO for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted t=e discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, tha= your Tom is 
now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is = bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
=AO 
In order to move forward 
I would ask =hat you realize that very unlike yours, My business is o=ly comprised of my personal attention and my 
personal time =AO . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various iss=es last year. . As you are my very 
close friend I will not hav= you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will hav= this year for my time . 
(hopefully a more fair way to allocat= ) I would also ask that you keep in mind that though our dea= expired months 
ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of th= final payment terms neither reflected the emails or my 
memory, we f=nished it up your way. ) I have answered every call Brad , josl=n, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs 
over and over/ u=til once again, I was forced to insert myself =trongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious 
dollar and =ime concessions last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to a=commodate some of your concerns , 
but I am, under no circumsta=ces , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After c=eaning up Carlyn's mess, 
which was a few weeks and 30 million dollars=C2 . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in=which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its=C2 seriousness. and those very circumstances I took extra 
care in=our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a ho=rible position to be in with my very close 
friend.), unfortunately I fear =hat if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will=appear of your own 
design ) 
I heard you when yo= said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now requir=d. The art partnership 
has fully answered all your concerns and disc=arged all my obligations and more so.. ( FYI Carlyns art partnership that 
you referenced is =AOsimilar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you required that my pa=ments be at the end of 
my work not at the beginning as everyone else's=.( my work was never to include hours upon hours of training your 
st=ff). I eventually agreed, this of course should ma=e clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 =s not 
covered by our past agreement at all. I pointed this very fact out t= you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement 
right out of the box= you said you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced=C2 results to date, far in excess of even 
my own exalted opi=ion of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited am=unt of time-- way, 
way in excess of our agreement. I will be f=ir, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last =ear if that 
helps .. However, As my best student , and m= only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all= of the 
required work yourself. I can put my whiteboard away w=en you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. share 
moments =deas etc.. I am of course always available to guide you as a=friend if you choose that route . always . It will 
take a great deal=C2 of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money o= mine . 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave=at 5 am sat morning.
