874 F.3d 787, *; 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 20596, fl; 
Bankr. L. Rep. (CCH) P83,176; 64 Bankr. Ct. Dec. 216 
deferred cash payments) whose total 'value, as of the effective date of the plan, . . . is not 
less than the allowed amount of such claim." 11 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii). The question 
became, as here, how to calculate the interest on the deferred payments such that the 
creditor would receive the full value of its claim. No single interest-calculation method 
secured a majority vote on the Court, r799J resulting in a plurality opinion endorsing the 
"formula" method. 
[HN7] The "formula" approach endorsed by the Till plurality instructs the bankruptcy court 
to begin with a largely risk-free interest rate, specifically, the "national prime rate . . . which 
reflects the financial market's estimate of the amount a commercial bank should charge a 
creditworthy commercial borrower to compensate for the opportunity costs of the loan, the 
risk of inflation, and the relatively slight risk ["23] of default." 541 U.S. at 479. The 
bankruptcy court should then hold a hearing to determine a proper plan-specific risk 
adjustment to that prime rate "at which the debtor and any creditors may present 
evidence." Id. Using this approach, "courts have generally approved adjustments [above 
the prime rate] of 1% to 3%." Id. at 480.. 
8 Here. the bankruptcy court applied risk adjustments of 2.0% and 2.75%. which it added to the Treasury rate of 2.1% to arrive 
at interest rates of 4.1% and 4.85%. respectively. 2014 Sankt LEXIS 3926. 2014 WL 4436335. at '32. Debtors assert in their 
briefing that the Treasury rate dropped by approximately 0.2% between the confirmation date and the plan's effective date. 
which thereby further lowered their notes' interest rate. 15-1682 8r. of Appellee at 11 n.3. 
The Till plurality arrived at the "formula" rate after rejecting a number of alternative 
methods relied on by the lower courts. Significantly, it rejected methods relying on 
purported "market" rates of interest because those rates "must be high enough to cover 
factors, like lenders' transactions costs and overall profits, that are no longer relevant in 
the context of court-administered and court-supervised cramdown loans." 541 U.S. at 477. 
The plurality then identified the only factors it viewed as relevant in properly ensuring that 
the sum of deferred payments equals present value: (i) the time-value of money; (ii) 
inflation; and (iii) the risk of non-payment. Id. at 474. The plurality concluded that the 
"formula" or "prime-plus" method best reflects those considerations. 
Although Till involved a Chapter 13 petition, the plurality intimated that the "formula" 
method might be applicable to rate calculations made ["24] pursuant to other similarly 
worded Code provisions. In fact, it cited the Chapter 11 cramdown provision, 11 U.S.C. § 
1129(b)(2)(A)(i)(II), among many other provisions, when it noted that "[w]e think it likely 
that Congress intended bankruptcy judges and trustees to follow essentially the same 
approach when choosing an appropriate interest rate under any of these [Code] 
provisions." Id. at 474 & n.10. 
Despite that language, however, the plurality made no conclusive statement as to whether 
the "formula" rate was generally required in Chapter 11 cases. And, notably, the plurality 
went on to state, in the opinion's much-discussed footnote 14, that the approach it felt best 
applied in the Chapter 13 context may not be suited to Chapter 11. Specifically, in that 
footnote , the Court stated that in Chapter 13 cramdowns "there is no free market of willing 
cramdown lenders." 541 U.S. at 476 n.14. It continued: "[i]nterestingly, the same is not true 
in the Chapter 11 context, as numerous lenders advertise financing for Chapter 11 debtors 
in possession. Thus, when picking a cramdown rate in a Chapter 11 case, it might make
