The British banking debate after Bob Diamond 
Summary 
• Bob Diamond's resignation as Chief Executive of Barclays bank clearly marks a turning point 
in the politics of banking in the UK. 
• The most significant political and regulatory outcome from these events will be to renew 
the debate about universal banking. Whereas to date this debate has focused on scale, 
implicit subsidy and systemic risk, it will now focus on culture, personal character 
and contamination from the values of the trading floor to the rest of a banking 
institution. Because these things cannot be regulated, the probability is that politicians will 
focus on their proxies, especially pay. 
• The gap between the inherent values and perceived risks of retail and investment banking 
has been further widened by the events of the last two months. For leaders of universal 
banks, especially those who have risen through investment banking, closing this gap in the 
mind of political stakeholders poses a particular challenge. Mr Diamond's belated 'citizenship 
agenda' at Barclays was well-conceived, but fatally hobbled by this tension. 
• By falling on his sword, Mr Diamond has created the possibility of a rapprochement between 
his former bank and British political opinion formers. The bigger issue for the bank he leaves 
behind and others like it is how - or if - it is possible after the crisis to rebuild political and 
regulatory confidence in the kind of financial markets businesses he dedicated his career to 
building and the people who run and profit from them. 
Bob Diamond's resignation as Chief Executive of Barclays bank clearly marks a turning point in 
the politics of banking in the UK. The announcement that Barclay's was to be fined E290mn as 
part of a settlement with the FSA financial regulator over its part in the fixing of the London 
interbank lending rate between 2005 and 2008 proved the tipping point for Mr Diamond. The 
Barclay's CEO has long been the most controversial of Britain's bank leaders and had few 
political friends. Yet in the end, the trigger for his resignation was not direct political pressure, 
but the FSA's intimation to the Barclay's board that unattributed threats from the top of 
Barclays to the Bank of England had made Barclays' relationship with its regulator potentially 
toxic. 
Mr Diamond's departure and the LIBOR-fixing scandal will mark the start of a new phase in the 
politics of the banking crisis in Britain. The suggestion that traders at Barclays and other banks 
were manipulating what is ultimately a key public benchmark for pricing financial products 
compounds a run of mis-selling and tax planning controversies. With a Parliamentary enquiry 
now to take place on the LIBOR issue in the UK, and the issue likely to ripple across other
