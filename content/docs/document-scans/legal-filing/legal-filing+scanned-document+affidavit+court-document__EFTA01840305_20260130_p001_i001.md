Jeffrey Epstein 
the email you showed me last night was also after 
months of an explicit agreement ( you 
telling me you decided thatthough you had raised the sex involvment previously you decided that 
things as they were fine and specifilay said so ),Idi everything i could to enhance your career 
Rife. 
then you broke our agreement, gave me an ultimatum, one week before a trip that had been 
planned for months, and left me without viable alternatives . My trip was made extremely difficult 
by your as you put it ( I changed my mind).. Even after that , as always I try to give you another 
opportunity as i think your flying is admirable and important for your future„ I made it crustal 
clear that , as i just had another run in with your change of mind/ moodiness that i would not 
accept , any whatsever excuse for another bad mood, etc. you point to your email where you ask 
that i be frinedly and not cold , ignoring once again your actions in making my africa trip difficult, 
( though i met face to face with you to try to explain , hear you out, . ) . I again reiiterated that i 
was done with excuses / i ve heard them all.. you couldn't help yourself , ( i understand that ). 
you couldn't control yourself ( i understand that ).. but I also have made it clear that I have only 
good feelings towards you but want no more of your attitudes , moods. neagtivity, in a nasty 
tone you told me you didn't know the girls name,nor did you care. I told you that i thought you 
should leave the island as early as possible , but you stayed until 10 . I was surprised to see you , 
as i had hoped you would have spent time with larry as i requested at the hangar. I have no 
advantage whatsoever in letting you ever fly me again. In that regard , ( flying , you arc easily 
replacable ). I am willing out of a sense of loyalty , to let you fly, but will accept not one ioata of a 
problem , a proboem that i will not have if anyone else is in the co pilot seat. Your attempt to 
explain to me for the umpteenth time why you again feel justified, fell on and will continue to fall 
on deaf ears. your question re obedience or originality , is a binary question that is not well 
posed. I tried to be a good friend„ you decided to give me a take it or leave it after months of 
agreement on a trip. I do not hold it against you. I will let you fly , If you choose not to , that is 
also ok. I will remain as friendly to you as you are to me.
