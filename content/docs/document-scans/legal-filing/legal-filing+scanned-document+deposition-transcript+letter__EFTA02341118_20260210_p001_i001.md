I am =ften asked to give my views and to rate the distinguished list of =nbsp;todays various financiers. I hesitate to do 
so as my area of =xpertise is now philanthropy and was formerly technology, =nbsp;Money is a product of my past 
endeavors and the leverage for my =uture social goas. That being said, without a doubt , one =f the smartest people i 
have ever met, and I fear this statement =nbsp;will be controversial.is New Yorks Jeffrey Epstein, =oth he and I are 
very aware of his mistakes that now over a decade =ater still cause concern amongst some very accomplished people, 
=nbsp;but i am a firm believer that everyone, deserves a second =hance and then can be measured on the product of 
the work after asking =or forgiveness. that is a great part of what makes this =ountry strong. 
Jeffret is neither fluent in =panish, french or italian however he is highly conversant =nd 
multilingual in the areas of the most =nbsp;advanced sciences and finance.. He can exquisitely =nbsp;conduct a 
seminar in fields as diverse as evolutionary biology, =omputational neuro science.or even the highly esoteric 
=athematics that permeate our future. Mathematicans at Harvard marvel at =is breadth that spans the divide between 
the esoteric and the very =orld.. 
His interests are far and wide and =nlike many gentleman scientists that simply repeat back what they =ave read , he 
has been an integral part of the creative process in =aried fields. , signal intelligence, power law distributions , =nd 
encryption. His facile and hyper speed grasping of complex financial =ssues remains unique in my experience. He 
neither qualifies =or does he hold himself out as a great investor like my friend =arren, or an economist like Larry 
Summers, but his knowledge of =oney, its uses. its technicalities and its burdens are something he has =aught many of 
my colleagues. \ 
Again , as to reiterate =y open eyes I am well aware that in his colorful past he =as made some awful decisions, Im 
sure he would have done =hings differently if he had the opportunity to do them over. =owever he has paid his debt to 
society, asked his friends and family =or forgiveness and has continued his charitable work that he began even =ecades 
before his travails. 
i have had =he privilege to meet the worlds greatest minds, and i can easily =ay that Jeffrey s is amongst the best of 
=hose. 
I have utmost confidence in his =ntegrity. I have dealt with him for a number of years on both =ides of a negotiation and 
say with certainty that I;d rather be =n his side. 
He has been in the =illionaire business for longer than almost anyone else. His =nsight into the unique problems of the 
super wealthy, has been =nvaluable to many others that i know. He found a niche in the early 80s =iscerning the 
burdens of hyper wealth and from his time on the board of =ockefeller or his time at the trilateral commission, the 
common =efrain from those he has come in contact with Jeffrey has made me think =ifferently about. ....//. =/span> 
He has an extraordinary =bility with numbers, complex concepts. mixed with a =nbsp;sometimes brutal honesty, 
refreshing, a sense of humor =hat some find highly cultured others find just outright =illy, 
His homes are probably the best =ollection of private real estate in the united states. A =rivate island , that some 
describe as a tribute to megalomania. and a =anch in new mexico that is truly beyond imagination and my favorite 
=ownhouse in NY. His attention to detail is remarkable =nbsp; . I find it sad that he doesn't have children of his own, 
=ut makes up for it by maintaining close friendships that have =asted for decades.
