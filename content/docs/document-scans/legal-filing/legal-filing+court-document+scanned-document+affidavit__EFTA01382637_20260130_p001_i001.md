card distribution platform supports comprehensive open and closed loop prepaid, store-branded gift card program management, offering end-to-end

Changes in Capital Structure 
During 2014, we made significant changes to our capital structure to reduce our interest expense and increase our free cash flow. This 
included our parent company, FDH, completing a $3.5 billion private equity placement. Approximately $2.5 billion of the net proceeds were 
contributed to us as a capital contribution and used to strengthen our consolidated balance sheet by paying down approximately $2.2 billion of debt 
and $214 million in call premiums. Additionally, we repriced $5.7 billion of our 2018 Term Loans during 2014. As a result, as of December 31. 
2014, we had a weighted average interest rate of 7.4% across our debt and approximately 80% of our debt was at a fixed rate, providing a measure 
of protection if interest rates begin to rise. 
On June 2, 2015, we refinanced our senior secured revolving credit facility and increased the amount available under this facility to 
$1.25 billion. On July 10, 2015. we entered into a joinder agreement to our senior secured credit facilities providing for incremental term loans of 
$725 million and E250 million ($276 million), the proceeds of which were used to redeem $955 million of our 7.375% sennior secured first lien 
notes due 2019. Associated with the redemption, we incurred approximately $43 million in interest and call premiums. Should interest rates remain 
stable, we anticipate that these transactions will reduce our cash interest expense going forward.
