In addition to the criminal charges, there are nine federal and six state lawsuits pending against Epstein, all 
containing similar allegations: that Epstein, through his employees and assistants, brought minor girls to his 
Palm Beach home at 358 El Brillo Way for erotic massages and sometimes sex. 
If Epstein violates any of the conditions of his state plea agreement during his sentence and up to 90 days after, 
the U.S. Attorney's Office "reserves the right to indict (or unseal an existing indictment against) Mr. Epstein," 
according to federal court documents filed by Epstein attorney Michael Tein. 
Tein filed the documents in support of a motion asking U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra to stay proceedings in 
a federal lawsuit by one of Epstein's victims until after Epstein completes all conditions of his sentence plus the 
three months. 
If the lawsuit is not postponed, anything Epstein says in his defense could be used against him in a federal 
prosecution, Tein argued. 
Marra denied the motion. 
"The court sees no reason to delay this litigation for the next 33 months," he wrote. "After all, defendant is in 
control of his own destiny — it is up to him (and him alone) whether the plea agreement reached with the State 
of Florida is breached. If defendant does not breach the agreement, then he should have no concerns regarding 
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination." 
Under the conditions of his plea agreement, Epstein must register as a sex offender for life. While he is serving 
the 12 months of house arrest at his Palm Beach home, Epstein must: 
* Observe a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. 
* Have no unsupervised contact with anyone younger than 18. 
* Neither view, own nor possess pornographic or sexual materials. 
As a convicted sex offender, he will not be allowed to live within 1,000 feet of a school, playground or other 
place where children gather. 
The federal deferred-prosecution agreement, which is tied to his state plea agreement, is under seal, but Tein's 
motion provided glimpses into the sealed agreement. 
Paperwork filed by Tein discloses that "under the agreement, the USAO presently retains the continuing right to 
indict Mr. Epstein — or to unseal 'any' already-existing federal 'charges' that may already have been handed up 
by the federal grand jury and sealed — should he breach any of its provisions." 
The Tein motion also indicates that the U.S. Attorney's agreement with Epstein requires that: 
* The grand jury's subpoenas remain outstanding. 
* The parties must maintain their evidence. 
* Any existing charges will not be dismissed until after Epstein has "fulfilled all the terms and conditions of the 
agreement." 
The agreement also includes "a promise not to prosecute defendant 
my if Epstein successfully 
fulfills all the terms and conditions of the state agreement." 
Epstein's former assistant, was investigated for bringing the girls up to the room in his Palm Beach home 
ere 
w ere pstein was waiting and for paying the girls afterward. She has not been charged.
