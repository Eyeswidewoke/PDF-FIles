leathe US-MAP rating to -2 from the 0 suggested by the inline "headline" payrolls reading because of the much

at MAIN POINTS: 
08 I. Nonfarm payrolls fell 125.000. more than accounted for by a 225,000 drop in Census employment. 
:3 Elsewhere, the private sector added 83,000 jobs and non-Census government employers 17,000. These 
0 numbers are fairly close to consensus expectations, especially once we take into account a cumulative net 
(N upward revision of 25,000 to total payrolls in May. There is some evidence that private sector hiring benefited 
ew from the unwind of a Census "displacement" effect in May. both in the pickup in overall private employment 
Yogrowth (83k vs. 33k in May) and in the sectoral distribution of gains, with a sha rp rebound in leisure and 
rk hospitality employment (+37k after -7k in May). The establishment survey benefited from a birth-death 
ti adjustment of +147k, 14k more than in June 2009. 
me 
) 2. Other aspects of the establishment survey were considerably weaker. The payroll diffusion fell to 52.2 in the 
nonfarm business sector, from 54.8 in May and a recent high of 68.0 in April. The workweek dropped 0.1 
M hours to 34.1, with almost all of this drop due to a sharp 0.5-hour drop in manufacturing. Moreover, average 
ix hourly earnings fell 0.1%, on top of a downward revision to the prior month. Average hourly earnings now 
h stand at just+ 1.7% year-on-year, a new cycle low. Hence, the implications for private-sector income 
wegeneration as well as inflation are negative. 
ak 
cr 3. The household survey was very weak as well. The drop in the unemployment rate was entirely due to a huge 
th 652k drop in the labor force, undoubtedly partly due to the dropout of Census workers from the labor force. 
an Only sonic of these workers seem to have gone into the "pool of available workers" as broader measures of 
he underemployment were mostly down as well. However. the Census cannot explain the fact that the 
ad employment/population ratio fell back to 58.5% in June from a peak of 58.8% in April (when the level of 
lin Census workers was lower than in June).
