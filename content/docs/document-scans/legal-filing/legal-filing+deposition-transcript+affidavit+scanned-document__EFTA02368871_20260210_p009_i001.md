South Korea and Japan, North K=rea and South Korea, China and the Philippines, India and China. Taiwan is=always a 
possible flashpoint. Any one of these could drag the United States in. 
The scariest develo=ment may be in North Korea, the world's only hereditary prison camp, whe=e the young leader —
the third-generation Kim — seems determined to ex=and and improve his nuclear arsenal until he becomes a genuine 
threat not only to South Korea and Japan but to the United =tates 
chttp://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/24/n=rth-korea-nuclear-rocket-us> as well. Chinese officials are =aid to be 
alarmed by his intransigence but unwilling to try to rein him in= fearing even more the instability that might result. 
Obama in his first t=rm adopted a reasonable policy of ignoring North Korea as much as possible, while making clear that 
he would=reciprocate if it became more accommodating. Kim Jong Eun, who is thought =o be in his late 20s, could find 
ways to make that stance untenable. 
Meanwhile, China'= increasing assertiveness discomfits neighbors throughout Southeast and Ea=t Asia. China has 
claimed pretty much the whole South China Sea, though it= coastline is farther from much of it than that of Vietnam, 
Malaysia or the Philippines. It has sent planes and =hips to challenge Japan over a few rocky outcroppings that Japan 
calls the=Senkakus and China the Diaoyu Islands. It has been steadily increasing the=size and capability of its military 
forces; for the first time in many years, a neighbor, Japan, is following suit. 
If all this seems d=cidedly last century, maybe it's because new leaders in every key countr= are second- or third-
generation, bearing the burdens of their past. Japan=se Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is the grandson of a leader of 
imperial Japan—including in occupied China — who remade=himself as a pro-American prime minister after World War 
II. South Korea=92s president-elect, Park Geun-hye, is the daughter of a longtime presiden=; her mother was killed by a 
devotee of North Korea <http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013.01-25/world/36548=30_1_park-geun-hye•first-lady-
language-courses> <=pan style="font-size:18.0pt">. (The bullet was intended for her father, who was later assassinated 
by his intelligenc= chief.) Xi Jinping, China's new president, is the son of a revolutionar= colleague of Mao Tsetung who 
helped battle the Japanese during World War =1. North Korea's Kim Jong Eun is the grandson of Kim II-sung, who 
according to North Korean mythology fough= the Japanese in the 1930s and 1940s and the Americans and South 
Koreans i= the 1950s. 
It's intriguing t= speculate on the ghostly whisperings these leaders may hear. It may be mo=e useful, though, to focus 
on the national weaknesses that may propel them=to act. North Korea is a failed and hungry state for which blackmail 
and bluster have long been the only survival str=tegy. China is a rising power and a growing economy — but led by a 
one-p=rty regime that may be tempted to use nationalism to distract a restive po=ulation from domestic troubles. Japan 
has discarded one prime minister after another, pretty much on an annual b=sis, for most of the past decade, an 
instability that leaves it punching b=low its economic and military weight. 
All of this makes t=e region hungry for U.S. presence and leadership, which Obama understood w=th his first-term 
promise of a "pivot" to Asia. Regional leaders hope =e can make good on that promise in a second term but wonder 
whether U.S. policy, too, will be shaped by political weak=ess. They notice when the Navy announces that it is, again, 
reducing its planned number of ships=/a> py L wjesi— i APMicrosoft Office Word 97-2003 Document
