Liquidity and Financial Resources 
Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $196.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to $146.4 million for the 
first quarter of fiscal 2014. The change in cash flow from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to the first quarter of 
fiscal 2014 was primarily due to improved net earnings after adjusting for non-cash charges and favorable changes in operating assets 
and liabilities, partially offset by increases in working capital. 
Our net cash flow used in operating activities was $165.1 million in fiscal 2014 compared to net cash provided by operating 
activities of $49.5 million in fiscal 2013 and $32.5 million in fiscal 2012. 
Net cash flow used in operating activities increased by $214.6 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was due 
to (i) our higher cash contributions to our pension and post-retirement benefits plans in fiscal 2014, primarily as a result of a $260.0 
million contribution to the Safeway Inc. ERP under a settlement with the PBGC related to the Safeway acquisition, (ii) an increase in 
interest payments of $298.4 million due to the increased borrowings for acquisitions and (iii) an increase in payments for acquisition and 
integration costs related to the Safeway acquisition, offset by cash inflows related to improved operations and the additional Safeway 
operations. As a result of the $260.0 million cash contribution to the ERP, we do not expect to make additional contributions to the ERP 
until 2018. 
Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $17.0 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to cash 
inflows related to the expansion of our operations from the NAI and United acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in interest 
payments of $278.0 million and increases in acquisition and integration costs.
