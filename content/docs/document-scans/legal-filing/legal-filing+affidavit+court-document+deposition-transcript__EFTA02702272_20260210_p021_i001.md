DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear are under no obligation to provide their services as depositaries for the 
debentures and may discontinue providing their services at any time. Neither we, the trustee nor the underwriters 
will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Clearstream, Euroclear or their direct participants or 
indirect participants under the rules and procedures governing these organizations. 
As noted above, beneficial owners of debentures generally will not receive certificates representing their 
ownership interests in the debentures. However, if: 
• DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the global debentures or if 
DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act at a time when it is 
required to be registered and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days of the notification 
to us or of our becoming aware of DTC's ceasing to be so registered. as the case may be: 
• we determine, in our sole discretion, not to have the debentures represented by one or more global 
debentures: or 
• an event of default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing with respect to the debentures. 
we will prepare and deliver certificates for the debentures in exchange for beneficial interests in the global 
debentures. Any beneficial interest in a global debenture that is exchangeable under the circumstances described 
in the preceding sentence will be exchangeable for debentures in definitive certificated form registered in the 
names that the depositary directs. It is expected that these directions will be based upon directions received by 
the depositary from its participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global debentures. 
We have provided the descriptions of the operations of DTC. Clearstream and Euroclear in this 
prospectus supplement solely as a matter of convenience. We take no responsibility for the accuracy of this 
information. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of those organizations and are 
subject to change by them from time to time. 
About the Trustee 
The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee. Subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, 
as amended, the trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its powers vested in it by the indenture at the 
request of any holder of the debentures unless the holder offers the trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it 
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might result. The trustee is not required to expend or risk its own 
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in performing its duties if the trustee reasonably believes that it is 
not reasonably assured of repayment or adequate indemnity. We have entered, and from time to time may 
continue to enter, into banking or other relationships with The Bank of New York Mellon or its affiliates. 
The trustee may resign or be removed with respect to one or more series of debt securities under the 
indenture. and a successor trustee may be appointed to act with respect to such series. 
Applicable Law 
The debentures and the indenture will be governed by. and construed in accordance with, the laws of the 
State of New York. 
Payment and Paying Agent 
We will pay principal of. and any premium, interest and additional amounts on the debentures by wire 
transfer of immediately available funds or, at our option, by check mailed to the registered holder. 
All moneys we pay to a paying agent of the trustee for the payment of principal of, or any premium, interest 
or additional amounts on, a debenture which remains unclaimed at the end of two years will be repaid to us, and 
the holder of the debenture may then look only to us for payment. 
The trustee will act as paying agent for the debentures.
