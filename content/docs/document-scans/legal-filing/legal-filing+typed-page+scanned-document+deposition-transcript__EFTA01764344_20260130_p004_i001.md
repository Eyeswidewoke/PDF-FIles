November 7, 2012 -- Within minutes of the President's reelection, my twitter feed was =live with conservatives fretting 
that Obama will take revenge upon Benjami= Netanyahu for doing everything he could to boost Mitt Romney and 
almost n=thing to boost Israeli-Palestinian peace. Unfortunately, they're probably wrong. 
The argument that in a second term Obama will intervene aggressivel= in the peace process rests on the mistaken belief 
that because he himself=doesn't have to run for reelection, he's freed from worrying about the domestic political costs 
of friction with Is=ael. That's untrue. 
Even if Obama is no longer worried=about reelection, virtually every Democrat in Congress still is, and it'= Congress 
where groups like AIPAC have long focused the bulk of their energy and wielded the bulk of their influence. =f Obama 
launches a diplomatic initiative that leads him into conflict with=Netanyahu, it will be the Democrats in Congress, 
especially the ones who r=n the Democratic Congressional and Senatorial Campaign Committees, and thus spend their 
time raising mone= for the 2014 midterms, who will make their displeasure felt. And given ho= much of Obama's second 
term fate depends on Democrats controlling the S=nate (and not falling further behind in the House), he won't easily be 
able to ignore them. What's more, if=Joseph Biden and/or Hillary Clinton have any desire to make their own runs=in 
2016, they'll be nervous about an American-Israeli clash, and the Pre=ident will not want to undermine their chances. 
And while the chances of a politically costly confrontation are hig= if Obama makes a renewed push for peace, the 
chances of success are low. =etanyahu, a heavy favorite to win reelection, vocally opposes the only parameters—the 
1967 lines plus swaps—that cou=d conceivably lead to a peace deal. Mahmoud Abbas publicly favors them, bu= in the 
four years since he negotiated seriously with Ehud Olmert, he's =rown weaker and less legitimate in the eyes of his 
people. That means his room to make wrenching concessions (esp=cially on refugees), and get Palestinians to accept 
them over the likely o=position of Hamas, has shrunk. 
What's more, Obama's Middle East agenda is crowded with other i=sues. In Bill Clinton's second term, when the region 
was more placid, he=had the time to invest heavily in Israeli-Palestinian (and Israeli-Syrian) peace. But Obama must 
grapple with the Iranian nuclea= issue, the bloodbath in Syria and all manner of potential crises in unpre=ictable ex-
client states like Egypt. All this will suck up the time that a= intensive peace push would require. 
Finally, anyone who has spent any time around Democratic foreign po=icy types in recent years knows that many of 
them are desperate to "pivo=" to Asia. Democrats feel that, for the most part, they've spent Obama's first term cleaning 
up George W. Bush=92s mess in the greater Middle East. While they know America must remain e=gaged there, they 
see the region largely as a place where America exerts e=ormous energy trying to keep bad things from getting worse. In 
Asia, by contrast, a Democratic secretary of state =an imagine himself (or herself) the new Dean Acheson, "present at 
the cr=ation." Since the greater Middle East has so dominated US foreign policy=in the post-9/11 decade, no president 
has laid out the kind of strategic vision for America's relationship wit= China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia etc that 
Acheson, George Kenn=n and Harry Truman famously did vis a vis Europe in the late 1940s. Ws=likely that Asia will 
receive more foreign policy attention in a second term because it is in Asia that Obama=and his top aides believe they 
can etch their names in the history books, = consideration that always looms larger in a president's second term. 
All this could be wrong. I hope it is. But it's worth noting that=while Obama mentioned the peace process often during 
the 2008 campaign, he=barely ever mentioned it this year. He didn't bring it up in his convention speech, the debates or 
his acceptan=e speech. The 2008 Democratic platform promised a "personal" president=al "commitment" to Israeli-
Palestinian peace. In 2012, that was taken =ut. 
The Jewish left and the Jewish right both have an interest in promo=ing the idea that Obama will intervene aggressively 
on the Palestinian iss=e in his second term. For the left, the prospect breeds hope, which fuels Jewish groups fighting for 
a two state s=lution. For the right, it breeds fear, which fuels Jewish groups skeptical=of a two state solution. But in a
