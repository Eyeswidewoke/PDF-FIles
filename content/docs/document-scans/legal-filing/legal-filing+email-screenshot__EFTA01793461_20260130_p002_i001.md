» 1. I believe that cognition is really about handling massive data =lows, by encoding it in ways that the cognitive agent 
can handle and =se to fulfill its demands. This works mostly by identifying apparent =egularities and turn them into 
perceptual categories, features, =bjects, concepts, ontologies and so on. Our nervous system offers =everal levels and 
layers of such complexity reduction, the first one of =ourse at the transition between sensory inputs and peripheral 
nervous =ystem (for physiological, tactile, proprioceptive input), or, in the =ase of visual perception, the compression we 
see between retina and =ptic nerve. The optic nerve transmits massively compressed data from =he retina to the 
thalamus, and from there to the striate cortex (the =rimary visual cortex, V1). V1 is the lowest level of a hierarchy of 
=isual and eventually semantic processing regions: from here, the dorsal =nd ventral processing streams head off into 
the rest of the cortex. V1 =ontains filtering mechanisms, which basically look for blobs, edges, =ovements, directions and 
soon, based on local contrasts. V2 organizes =hese basic features into a map of the visual field, including contours, =3 
detects large, coherently moving patterns, V4 encodes simple =eometric shapes, VS seems to take care of moving 
objects, and V6 =elf-motion. The detection of high-level features always projects back =nto the lower levels, to 
anticipate and predict the lower level =eatures that should be isolated based on the higher-level perceptual =ypothesis. 
The story is similar for auditory processing, and eventually =he integration of basic visual and optical percepts into 
semantic =ontent: at each level, we take extremely rich and heterogeneous =atterns and reduce their complexity. 
» The transformation from concepts to language also represents another, =ncredible level of complexity reduction. 
» The highest complexity reduction, however, takes place at the =nterface between conscious thought and all the other 
processes. I =elieve that the prefrontal cortex basically holds a handful of pointers =nto the associative cortical 
representations, skimming off only a =andful objects, relations or features at a time, and bring them into =he conscious 
focus of attention. 
» The perspective of the need for staying at a complex level is =ntirely warranted, though: there are many intermediate 
representations =hat allow cognitive processes only if the complexity stays high, and =ight even need to increase it. This 
includes many sensor-motor =oordination processes, but also most creative, more intuitive =xploration. 
» This is not the same complexity as the one at the input, however! =his as a level where data is already split into 
modalities, =emantically organized and so on. On the other hand, it is much more =omplex as linguistic or cognitively 
accessible types of mental content. 
» 2. Scientists tend to have a fixation on thinking with language, and =t is quite natural to fall for abstract, a-modal 
representations, such =s predicate logic systems or extensions of these when it comes to =odeling cognition and 
problem solving. This might explain the fixation =f cognitive architectures like Act-R and Soar on rule-based 
=epresentations, and the similar approaches of a lot of work in =lassical Al. 
» On the other hand, there is a lot of work on learning and 
» =lassification to handle vast complexity, with the goal of reducing 
» it. =A particular beautiful example was Andrew Ngs work on deep 
» learning, =here his group took 30 million randomly chosen frames from 
» Youtube, and =rained an unsupervised neural net to make sense of 
» them. They ended up =ith spontaneously emerging detectors for many 
» typical object =ategories, including cats and human faces. I could 
» not avoid to think =f that paper when Takashi mentioned his 
» fascination with looking at TV =ixels directly...) -->

» Thus, the typical strategies seem to encompass "abstract 2 abstract" =ognition, and "complex 2 abstract" cognition. 
What about "abstract 2 =omplex" and "complex 2 complex"? Most of the existing approaches on =complex 2 complex" 
cognition are not really cognitive, such as Ansgar =redenfeld's "Dual Dynamics" architecture, or Herbert Jaeger's Echo 
=tate Networks. The current proponents of such complex cognition are =lso often radical embodimentalists (cognition as 
an extension of sensor =otor control, neglecting dreams, creativity, imagination, and =apabilities for abstract thinking).
