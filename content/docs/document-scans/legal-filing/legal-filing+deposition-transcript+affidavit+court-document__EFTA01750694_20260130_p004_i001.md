These decrees follow increasing concerns over fragmentation within the Yemeni political and security 
forces' infrastructure, which were further highlighted by the Security Council's call for "military units 
to remain committed to their obligation of neutrality" in its July 11th statement. 
Central and South Asia 
Afghanistan: US Secretary of State John Kerry brokered an election deal between the two presidential 
candidates Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani on Saturday July 12th. For the time being, the deal 
holds out hope for a nonviolent conclusion to the election process, once an internationally monitored 
audit of the votes is complete. There is speculation that the results may not be known by August 2n°
when outgoing President Karzai is constitutionally expected to step down, further raising concerns 
about this important handover of power. The ongoing political uncertainty is deeply damaging to the 
already desperate economic situation and the fragile security situation. An attack by a suicide bomber 
killed at least 41 people in Paktika province on the border with Pakistan on July 15th. The bombing is 
almost certainly linked to the pressure on militants across the border in Waziristan, Pakistan (see 
below). Early speculation is pointing to the Haqqani network as likely behind the attack, which has 
been rumored to have had advance notice when the Pakistani offensive began a month ago. 
Pakistan: The military offensive against the Pakistani Taliban and foreign fighters continues in north 
Waziristan. The offensive has produced an estimated 950,000 internally displaced people. While the 
press has little or no access to the areas of fighting, Pakistani military sources are allowing photos of 
captured weapons, and articles are describing recently abandoned suicide bombing schools. 
Sri Lanka: The effects of intercommunal violence and riots that erupted on June 14th are playing out in 
coastal towns south of Colombo, known as the country's resort region. At least four people were 
killed and nearly 80 seriously injured in the immediate aftermath of clashes in two Muslim-majority 
towns, after the Buddhist nationalist group Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) held a protest march. While violence 
was contained to these towns, armed police and military stood guard at mosques and Muslim-owned 
shops across the country into the first week of July. President Mahinda Rajapakse and his 
administration faced criticism for their limited response to the violence, while Justice Minister Rauf 
Hakeem, who is also leader of the country's main Muslim party, warned that continued discrimination 
against the Muslim community could increase the influence of outside radical groups.
