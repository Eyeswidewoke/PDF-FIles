Form ADV Part 2A 
iCapital cannot predict the timing and amounts of the capital contributions that will be 
required to be made by Investors to any Private Access Fund. Such capital contributions may 
be called on an irregular basis, although as previously noted, iCapital will require each Investor 
to make a capital contribution to a Private Access Fund on or before the date it is admitted to 
a Private Access Fund (which amount will be held in escrow pending acceptance of the 
Investor's Subscription by iCapital). iCapital will provide written notice of the exact size and 
timing of the initial capital contribution in advance of the initial closing of a Private Access 
Fund. If an Investor fails to make a required capital contribution to a Private Access Fund on its 
due date (including, without limitation, recalls of distributed capital). regardless of the reason 
(including legal or other prohibitions). iCapital may impose substantial penalties on such 
Investor and use any available remedies to enforce the contribution obligation. If a Private 
Access Fund fails to make a capital contribution with respect to its investment in the 
Underlying Fund when due, whether as a result of a default of an Investor or otherwise, the 
Underlying Fund may exercise various remedies against the Private Access Fund, including 
forfeiture of all, or a part of. its investment in the Underlying Fund, which will have a material 
negative impact on the return of the Private Access Fund as a whole.

providing investment advice or making any recommendation as to the advisability of an 
investment in a Private Access Fund or the Underlying Fund. iCapital and its affiliates and 
personnel are not required to devote all or any specified portion of their time to managing the 
Private Access Funds' affairs, or from engaging in any other business activities, whether or not 
competitive with a Private Access Fund. Each prospective investor in a Private Access Fund 
should consult with its own counsel and advisors as to all legal. tax, financial and related 
matters concerning an investment in the Private Access Fund.

partners of the Underlying Fund, will have no direct interest in the Underlying Fund and will 
have no standing or recourse against the Underlying Fund, the Underlying Fund Manager. their 
respective affiliates o• any of their respective advisors, officers, directors, employees, partners 
or members. 
No Rights to Vote or Partidpate. In the event that there is an issue to be voted upon by the 
investors of any Underlying Fund. iCapital. and not the Investors in any Private Access Fund, 
will determine how a Private Access Fund's interest in the applicable Underlying Fund will be 
voted. In addition, Investors in any Private Access Fund will have no opportunity to participate 
directly in the day-to-day operations of such Underlying Fund. 
Terms of the Underlying Fund. The terms of each Underlying Fund are subject to change. There 
can be no assurances that the partners of any Underlying Fund will not amend such Underlying 
Funds' governing agreement. Neither any Private Access Fund nor iCapital will have the ability 
to unilaterally block any amendment of any Underlying Funds' governing agreement. None of 
any Underlying Fund Manager. any Underlying Fund or iCapital will have any liability or 
responsibility to any Investor for any changes to the terms of the Underlying Fund. iCapital is 
under no obligation to revise or supplement the applicable PPM. notwithstanding any 
amendments to any Underlying Funds' governingagreement.
