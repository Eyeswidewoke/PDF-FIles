diagnostic imaging and =adiation therapy services, announced that the 2nd amendment =the "Amendment") to its 
Credit Agreement dated December 1, 2009 =the "Credit Agreement") has become effective. The Amendment =odifies 
the Credit Agreement's maximum leverage covenant to require =hat the Company maintain a maximum ratio of 
consolidated total debt to =onsolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, less minority interest =xpense of 5.00 to 
1.00 through September 30, 2014, 4.75 to 1.00 from =ctober 1, 2014through September 30, 2015, 4.50 to 1.00 from 
October 1, =015 through December 31, 2015 and 4.25 to 1.00 =hereafter. On November 5, 2012, in connection with the 
=mendment, the Company raised $30.0 million from the sale of certain =maging assets, which the Company
