Re: 
hah... I mentioned this email to my wife and she said "Noo, don't cut your hair, it's so sexyl I 
 You managed to get a 
hedge fund started with long hair, so what's the problem?" 
But of course, if some sufficiently awesome opportunity comes up that requires me to adopt a different look or persona, 
I'm willing to do that.... Getting AGI built is more important than preserving the look I'm used to and my wife likes .... 
Back in 20001 had short hair for a while... 
It seems, though, that long hair has been no obstacle to me getting taken seriously as a futurist pundit.... And short hair 
has not caused Joscha, Itamar etc. etc. to get loads of AGI funding ;p 
If there are folks you'd like to introduce me to, who you think would be put off by my current appearance, I can buy a 
nice suit and tie my hair back in a ponytail, and I guess that may suffice? ;) 
On a more interesting note, I just heard from David Hanson that he's been talking to you about you potentially funding 
our joint AGI/robotics research efforts, as well as about him sculpting a robo-Epstein for you 
 That would be 
awesome. I'm sure you will really enjoy meeting David, he's a dynamic guy as well as a canny entrepreneur, an 
innovative scientist and an amazing artist.... He is exactly the collaborator I needed in order to work on robotics.... I 
feared dealing with robotics for a long time, because working with robot mechanics can be a huge time sink. But with an 
innovative, AGI-friendly roboticist as a collaborator, I think robotics can be a very productive direction for OpenCog 
AGI... 
Thanks for helping out Joscha, by the way. He had kind of resigned himself to not being able to focus on AGI, and you 
have totally changed his outlook and attitude !! It's nice to see ;)
