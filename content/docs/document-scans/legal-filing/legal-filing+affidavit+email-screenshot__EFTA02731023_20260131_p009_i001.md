transaction." To date, you have not provided any explanation as to how payments to Epstein 
with respect to the step-up-basis transaction were determined and whether any statements of 
work or other documents properly substantiating Epstein's role in the transaction even exist. 
The Committee believes that payments to Epstein with respect to the step-up-basis 
transaction merit further investigation. Compensation at these amounts in an estate and tax 
planning matter is irregular and unusually high, particularly since Epstein's contributions to the 
transaction relied on the guidance of other legal advisors. In this case, Epstein's compensation 
with respect to the transaction was documented to have been significantly higher than your other 
advisors on these matters. 
Refusal to provide information regarding Epstein's compensation scheme 
The Committee remains concerned about the payments to Epstein in amounts that would 
represent a highly unusual compensation scheme. Unfortunately, you have refused to cooperate 
with inquiries into payments to Epstein, raising serious concerns regarding the lack of 
substantiation for the extraordinary amounts of such payments. 
According to the Dechert report, you paid Epstein $158 million between 2012 and 2017, 
an amount that seems inexplicably high based on currently available information. This 
compensation scheme, which averaged approximately $25 million per year, appears to be well in 
excess of expected compensation for tax and estate planning services — particularly in a case 
where Epstein's work was required to be vetted by other legal and accounting professionals, at 
times was not viewed as useful, and included instances of substantial misrepresentations of tax 
laws!' Despite not being a certified public accountant or licensed tax attorney, Epstein was paid 
amounts that far exceeded what you paid other professional advisors, including some of the most 
high-priced legal counsel in the nation.' 
In order to better understand Epstein's compensation scheme, the Committee submitted a 
detailed set of questions and document requests. These requests included copies of any signed or 
unsigned agreements with Epstein, the written service agreement you entered into with Epstein 
on February 13, 2013 and documents related to payments made to Epstein as part of these 
agreements. This request specified that these documents should include any statements of work 
or descriptions of the services rendered by Epstein for which he was compensated as part of 
these agreements.

by Epstein."

Family Office employees, Paul Weiss, and other outside legal, accounting, and tax professionals"; at page 11, "[Mr. 
Epstein's] ideas would appear plausible at face value, but did not hold up under scrutiny"; at page 17, "Black was 
under the misconception that his payments to Epstein would be tax deductible ('sixty cent dollars') because this is 
what Epstein had told Black." )

paid to his other professional advisors."
