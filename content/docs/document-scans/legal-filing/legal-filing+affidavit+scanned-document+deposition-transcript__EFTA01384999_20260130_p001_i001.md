contribution of additional assets to the partnership in exchange for a new partnership interest or the 
issuance of partnership interests for services. 
Under the above rules, if we acquire assets in exchange for interests in our operating partnership 
in a carry-over basis transaction (i.e., a transaction in which the contributing partner defers its gain for 
U.S. federal income tax purposes), we may be allocated lower amounts of depreciation and other 
deductions for tax purposes, and possibly greater amounts of taxable income in the event of a 
disposition of the contributed properties, as compared to our share of such items for economic or book 
purposes. Thus, these rules may cause us to recognize taxable income in MISS of cash proceeds, which 
might adversely affect our ability to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. See "—Annual 
Distribution Requirements Applicable to REIM." Because a taxable disposition of the contributed 
properties generally also accelerates recognition of the contributing partner's deferred tax gain, as part 
of a tax-deferred acquisition of farms for interests in our operating partnership we may agree to 
compensate the contributing partner for the accelerated tax, which would further increase the costs to 
us for taxable disposition of contributed properties. 
Withholding Obligations with Respect to Non-U.S. Partners. 
With respect to each non-U.S. limited partner, our operating partnership generally will be required 
to withhold at rates of 20%-35% with respect to the non-U.S. limited partner's share of our operating 
partnership income (with the rate varying based on the character of the items comprising the income 
and the status of the limited partner for U.S. federal income tax purposes), regardless of the amounts 
distributed to such non-U.S. limited partner. We will be liable for any under withholdings (including 
interest and penalties). Given our status as a REIT and our need to distribute income currently, we 
generally expect our operating partnership to make distributions on Common Units sufficient to cover 
a non-U.S. limited partner's withholding obligations. It is also possible that we might be obligated to 
withhold with respect to a non-U.S. limited partner's share of gain on a disposition generally qualifying 
for nonrecognition and with respect to which our operating partnership is not making distributions. Our 
operating partnership will have to make the withholding payments in any event even if the withholding 
obligation exceeds a limited partner's share of distributions. Unless it can recover the excess 
withholdings from the limited partner, our operating partnership will have to find other sources of cash 
to fund excess withholdings. 
Failure to Qualify as a REIT 
In the event we violate a provision of the Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a 
REIT, specified relief provisions will be available to us to avoid such disqualification if (1) the violation 
is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. (2) we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to 
satisfy the provision and (3) the violation does not include a violation under the gross income or asset 
tests or distribution requirements described above (for which other specified relief provisions are 
available). This cure provision reduces the instances that could lead to our disqualification as a REIT 
for violations due to reasonable cause. It is not possible to state whether, in all circumstances, we will 
be entitled to this statutory relief. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and the relief 
provisions of the Code do not apply, we will be subject to tax, including any applicable alternative 
minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to our stockholders in 
any year in which we are not a REIT will not be deductible by us, nor will they be required to be 
made. In this situation, to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, and. subject to 
limitations of the Code, distributions to our stockholders will generally be taxable to stockholders who 
are individual U.S. stockholders at a maximum rate of 20%, and dividends received by our corporate 
U.S. stockholders may be eligible for a dividends received deduction. Unless we are entitled to relief 
under specific statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from re-electing REIT status for the 
four taxable years following a year during which qualification was lost.
