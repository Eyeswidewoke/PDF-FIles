group). The WBV programme consisted of 96 training sessions =ithin a period of 32 weeks. The frequency of training was 
three times a =eek, with at least 1 day of rest between sessions in both experimental =roups. 
This study =as approved by the University's Bioethics Committee according to the =elsinki declaration. 
The WBV =roup 
The subjects =n the WBV group performed the vibration exercise in a standing =osition. In each session, 
vibration was provided by a commercially =vailable device (Galileo 2000, Novotec GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). The 
=ubjects stood with feet side-by-side on the board, which produced =ateral oscillations of the whole body. During the 
vibration training =essions, the subjects were barefoot to eliminate any damping of the =ibration caused by footwear. 
The angle of flexion of the knees during =he vibration exercise was set at 60*. The tridimensional =cceleration was 
monitored by a triaxial accelerometer (TSD109F, =riaxial accelerometer 5G, Biopac Systems, USA) attached to the skin at 
=he level of the lumbar spine (L3) and normalised by body weight =g). 
During the =irst 2 weeks of training, the WBV group performed three sets of 1 =inute vibration with a frequency 
of 12.6 Hz of vibration stimulus, =eparated by 1 minute resting periods. The training load was increased =ystematically 
during the following 6 weeks, increasing by one set each =eek until the 6 sets of WBV that we consider to be the load of 
this =ntervention. The resting period between sets was 1 minute. The vertical =mplitude of WBV was set at 3 mm. The 
duration of the WBV programme was =bout 30 minutes, which included 10 minutes warm-up consisting of S =inutes of 
bicycling at 50 W and 5 minutes of static stretching for the =uadriceps and triceps surae muscle. 
The =alking group 
The =alking group trained outdoors. Each 1-hour session of walking was =nterspaced with two periods of S 
minutes each that included stretching =xercises. Two research assistants, who were experienced physical =ducation 
graduates, supervised this group. 
BMD =ssessment 
At =aseline and at 8 months, BMD (g•cm-2) of the right proximal =emur (femoral neck, trochanter and Ward's 
triangle) and lumbar spine =ere assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Norland =xcell Plus; Norland Inc., 
Fort Atkinson, USA). 
Standard positioning was used with =nterior-posterior scanning of the right proximal femur and the lumbar 
=olumn. The same experienced technician performed all the scans. In our =aboratory, the day-to-day precision 
(Coefficient of Variation %) was =bout 1% at lumbar and femoral neck sites, and it was about 1.2% at the =est of femoral 
sites. 
Balance =ssessment 
Postural =alance was assessed with a blind flamingo test, in which the barefoot =ubject stood on one leg, while 
the other leg was flexed at knee level =nd held at the ankle by the hand of the same side of the body, and with =yes 
closed. The number of trials that the subject needed to complete 30 = of the static position (the chronometer was 
stopped whenever the =ubject did not comply with the protocol conditions) was measured. The =utcome was expressed 
as number of trials (= number of falls + 1). In =ur group, the test-retest intra-observer reliability coefficient of =his test 
calculated (Intra Class Coefficient = 0.83) can be =onsidered as acceptable for field testing in Spanish adults [22]. 
Statistical analysis 
Mean and standard deviation (SD) are given as descriptive =tatistics. Baseline characteristics were compared 
using =tudent's t-test for independent samples. The =ffects between groups were tested by ANOVA for repeated 
measurements, =djusted by body weight, age and baseline data. All analyses were =erformed with SPSS version 13.0 
software. A result was considered =tatistically significant when the P value =as < 0.05 for primary outcomes (BMD) and < 
0.01 for secondary =utcomes.
