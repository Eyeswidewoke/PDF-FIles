Ponzi schemer Rothstein moved to St. Lucie County Jail 
March 3rd 2010 by Sun-Senhnel 
FORT PIERCE — The mystery of convicted Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein's whereabouts may be solved. 
Authorities at the St. Lucie County Jail in Fort Pierce confirmed Tuesday that an inmate with Rothstein's name 
and date of birth is being held there "for housing only: The jail database does not list what charges the inmate is 
being held on. 
The federal Bureau of Prisons Web site listed Rothstein as having been "released" from the Miami Federal 
Detention Center on Friday. However, federal authorities said he's still in the custody of the U.S. Marshals 
Service. 
Rothstein pleaded guilty in January to masterminding a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme and he is facing up to life in 
prison when he is sentenced on May 6. 
Rothstein's defense attomey Marc Nurik said Monday that Rothstein had an unspecified -medical incident" last 
week and was taken to a hospital for treatment, and that Rothstein was either still receiving medical treatment or 
is being moved between detention centers. 
1 was advised he's in transit, that he's in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service,' Nurik said Monday. "He's 
not with prosecutors, he's not talking to the government. He had a medical incident last week and he was taken 
out to the hospital." 
Nurik was able to provide only a few more details Tuesday morning. He said he still had not learned what 
medical condition Rothstein had, but that it was not life threatening. 
'He was not beaten up, attacked, or whatever," Nurik said. "He had some kind of medical incident. I have not 
seen the records yet, but apparently it was not life threatening. He was experiencing some distress and was 
taken out of the facility for tests and observations." 
Rothstein has said in court that he is taking medication for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He is also 
taking Zoloft for 'anxiety," he has told the judge in his case. 
Federal prosecutors and marshals are typically tight-lipped when it comes to the movements of federal 
detainees and inmates, for security reasons. Alicia Valle, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, and 
Barry Golden, a spokesman for the Marshals Service, would say only that Rothstein remains in federal custody, 
without offering any more details. 
The federal government contracts with jails to hold detainees, and Nurik said Rothstein may have been moved 
to free up space at the Miami detention center. 
it could be as simple of bed space. He is not needed again until May,' said Nurik, before making light of the 
situation with a reference to Rothstein's expensive taste in cars, including a $1.5 million Bugatti seized by 
authorities. 
'I am not overjoyed that he is now in St. Lucie County because now I have to take my Bugatti, and I don't want 
to put the mileage on my Bugatti,' Nurik joked. "If he were cooperating, he would be at the Fountainebleau, or 
the W. at least. He is not cooperating. He is out of sight and out of mind, right now.'
