The Independent (Lo=don) 
US raises ale=t over possible chemical weapons arsenal as world leaders meet<=b> 
Charlotte Mcdonald-=ibson 
February 24, 2012&n=sp; -- World leaders struggling to force Syria's President from power will=gather in Tunisia today 
armed with fresh evidence that his regime ordered =rimes against humanity, including the killing of children, but calls for 
military intervention remain firmly off the age=da. 
Despite a growing b=dy of evidence that President Bashar al-Assad is personally culpable for t=e atrocities inflicted upon 
his own people - the rationale for military in=ervention in Libya - William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, said yesterday 
that a repeat of the Nato action tha= helped topple Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was unlikely. 
His comments come a=id rising concern that the splintered, disunited opposition may be infiltr=ted by extremist Sunni 
and al-Qa'ida fighters. American officials are also=concerned that President Assad is sitting on a cache of chemical 
weapons that could wind up in extremists' hands if =is regime fell. 
"We are operat=ng under many more constraints than we were in the case of Libya," Mr=Hague told BBC Radio 4's 
Today programme. "Syria sits next to Lebanon= Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq - what happens in Syria has an effect on all of 
those countries and the consequences of any outsid= intervention are much more difficult to foresee." 
Instead, he said, w=rld leaders including the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and leader= from the Arab League 
meeting under the Friends of Syria banner in Tunis t=day would focus on "tightening a diplomatic and economic 
stranglehold" on the regime. 
A new UN report on =yrian atrocities made public yesterday said that 500 children had been kil=ed in the violence. The 
panel of UN human rights experts has also compiled=a list of Syrian officials who could face investigation for crimes 
against humanity, which will be passed to th= UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The experts have indicated that 
th= list goes all the way up to the President himself. 
Any move to refer S=rian officials to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, however, =ould be likely to face 
opposition from Russia and China, who on 4 February=vetoed a UN resolution calling on President Assad to step aside. 
Activists hope this is one area where the Friends of =yria group could have some influence, even though Russia is not 
sending a =elegate. 
"They need to =hink of how to exert more pressure, not just on Syria, but on its allies,&=uot; said Nadim Houry, the 
Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Midd=e East. "I would hate to think the option is whether to bomb or not 
to bomb." 
So far, just a smal= fraction of the many armed and unarmed opposition groups has openly calle= for intervention, and 
many military analysts believe it would be disastro=s. 
"The great ris= is that the situation in Syria resembles that in Iraq and the entire gove=nment force and government 
authority disintegrates," said Shashank Jo=hi, an associate fellow from the Royal United Services Institute. "You are 
already seeing international actors star= to enter Syria from Iraq and other places, many of them are Sunni 
fundame=talist and have links to al-Qa'ida." 
Yesterday CNN cited=a US military report speculating that 75,0O0 ground troops could be needed=to secure Syria's 
chemical weapons sites. But unlike Iraq, where the alleg=d presence of chemical weapons and al-Qa'ida was used as a
