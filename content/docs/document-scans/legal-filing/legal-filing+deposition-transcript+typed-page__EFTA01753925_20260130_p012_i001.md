Robert D. Kaplan=/span>: Yes, I think one of the notic=able changes over the last few decades -- its gradual, it shifts back 
and =orth but it's certainly a change -- is like, whereas in the past you had a relatively confined space with a lot o= troops 
and equipment inside it, which is conventional, industrial war lik= tank battles in the Sinai in 1973, or in North Africa 
during World War 11= We're going from a small space with a lot of combatants inside it to vast spaces that include 
immense Thi=d World cities and deserts with small numbers of combatants hidden inside =hem. So whereas killing the 
enemy is easy, finding him is what's difficult= It's locating him that constitutes the real weapon of war, whereas in 
industrial war it was just a matter of =illing the enemy at his chief point of concentration. This new century, we=may still 
have major interstate industrial wars or naval battles, we don't=know that yet. But at least for the past few decades, 
what most people define as unconventional war or gue=rilla war or irregular war means a vast battle space with small 
numbers of=combatants hiding inside that space. 
George: I think one of the things that led to t=at transformation, is the transformation of mathematics in war, which was 
=he introduction of precision-guided munitions, which actually was introduced in the 1970s -- first by the United States 
w=en they destroyed a critical bridge in Vietnam that they hadn't been abl= to destroy for years, and then by the 
Egyptians and the Soviets, who sank=the Israeli destroyer Eilat with a single precision-guided munition. It used to take 
thousands of bombs to =nock out a target. That meant hundreds of planes at least, that meant larg= numbers of crews, 
steel factories, aluminum factories and so on and so fo=th. The industrial nature of war that you refer to really had a 
great deal to do with the imprecision of th= rifle. It's said -- and I'm not sure it's true -- it's said that in the F=rst World 
War it took 10,000 rounds of ammunition to kill one man. Perhaps= But it certainly was true that you had to have large 
numbers of weapons. With the introduction of precisi=n-guided munitions, you began with 50 percent hit/kill ratios and 
it rose =nd rose until one plane with one piece of munition would be able to destro= the enemy. And therefore, you had 
the same lethality with one aircraft and with hundreds. 
Robert: And we are seeing this especially in ai= war, because one of the things they say in the Air Force is "The les= 
obtrusive we are, the less number of planes we have overhead, the more lethal we can actually be." Because with 
p=ecision-guided munitions, guided by satellites or whatever they're guided =y, you don't have to drop a lot of ordnance 
to do damage. A single drone f=ring a medium or small-sized projectile can do the same amount of damage as decades 
ago would take a whole wing of=an air force to drop. But we haven't seen it yet in naval war only becau=e we haven't 
had a real naval war. But if we do, we're going to see that=repeat itself, perhaps. 
George: Well, I think the next step is infantry=war. But you know, it's interesting to me that during World War II, we 
had=a thousand bomb raids over Germany, and it was morally complex but nobody objected to bombing Germany, or 
very few=people -- of course, the Germans did. We now have this idea of the drone a= somehow a singularly unique 
moral weapon, particularly evil. It strikes m= as an ambiguous argument: Is it better to have World War II-style, 
thousand-bomber raids killing tens of t=ousands of people in order to destroy one factory, or to have an unmanned 
=ircraft striking it? Precision has on the one hand offended people with an=apparent callousness, which certainly is in 
the nature of war, but at the same time has the virtue that collater=l damage -- which will always be part of war, you will 
always make massive=mistakes -- have been reduced. 
Robert: And precision implies the death penalty=because the precision means that your chances of killing the target are 
90=percent, 80 percent, rather than 5 or 10 percent. So you're essentially carrying out a death sentence on someone= 
George: So there's a paradox. Massive raids tha= killed thousands of innocent people are seen as somehow less morally 
repr=hensible than the certainty of the death of one person, that has been targeted for that. It's a transformation of 
w=r. Now, the question really is, Is this war or something else? 
Robert: Or is it police actions? Carrying out a=sassinations? Because one of the natures of the post-9/11 world is we're 
h=nting down individuals as much as we're hunting down groups. And if you're hunting down individuals, and you have = 
revolution in precision-guided weapons, and the battlefield is vast, and =he individual is hiding in an apartment building 
in a slum in Peshawar, Pa=istan. This is a whole different world than the Korean War or World War II.
