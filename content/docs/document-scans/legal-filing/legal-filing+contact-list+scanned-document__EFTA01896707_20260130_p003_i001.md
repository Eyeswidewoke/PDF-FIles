YHG is a development of Island Global Yachting Ltd. ("IGY") phase I of 
which was substantially completed in 2006. YHG is luxury mixed use retail, marine and commercial

businesses and contractors ranging from landscapers and tradesman to high end caterers and yacht service 
companies. 
YHG was originally designed and conceived many years ago after long discussions with governmental, private-
sector, and community based groups in the USVI. The following core principals were outlined at that time: (i) 
bring luxury yachts back to St. Thomas by building a state of the an mega yacht marina (ii) serve as a crucial 
pedestrian and cultural link along the St. Thomas harbor, reconnecting the Havensight area with historic 
downtown Charlotte Amalie and (iii) create a beautiful place for the public, tourist and locals, to shop, work, 
eat, and play in a secure environment as well as enhancing the surrounding neighborhood. Today, YHG is 
known as the premier marina facility for mega yachts in the Caribbean as well as a luxury Galleria Mall with
