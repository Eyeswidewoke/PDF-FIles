4 Business Value 
Both the patient and the provider are positioned to benefit from a robust data exchange platform. Viewed 
from both perspectives, one may see that the quantifiable benefits gained by providers and organizations[5] 
are paralleled by greater convenience and better care outcomes for the patient. 
Patient Perspective: 
- Patients no longer need to coordinate the tedious and frustrating task of gathering records from various 
providers to send to their specialist. Instead, they would provide the specialist access to the blockchain, 
enabling them access to the data as they see fit. 
- Patients retain control of their data without having to be data stewards - meaning, they no longer 
have to spend time and energy keeping their data managed and up to date. They also no longer need 
to manually reconcile the data when they visit multiple providers, which can be a non-trivial task. 
- Ultimately, better and more available data leads to better care for the patient. 
Provider and Organization Perspective: 
- The true collaborative nature of creating and sharing data would eliminate many of the challenges of 
existing Health Information Exchange approaches. 
- Healthcare organizations do not have to fight for a data-driven competitive advantage, because they 
all have access to the same information. This approach will enable organizations to collaborate on care 
coordination and outcomes-based care. 
- Through existing trust/contracts with patients and partner hospitals/organizations, nodes can broad-
cast alerts or potential threats. 
- Data can be shared for research activities including clinical trials, enabling larger and more diverse 
patient populations. 
5 Summary 
The challenges of data sharing within the healthcare domain are significant. Simply sharing data is not 
enough - we've shown that effective data sharing networks require consensus on data syntax, meaning, and 
security. We've proposed that a blockchain can play a fundamental role in enabling data sharing within a 
network, and have defined the high level structures and protocols necessary to apply this new technology to 
healthcare. Building on techniques used successfully by other blockchain applications, we've introduced a 
new consensus algorithm designed to facilitate data interoperability. Finally, we have applied extra measures 
of security on the blockchain such as network-wide keys and smart contracts, keeping security a top priority. 
Ultimately, we believe that a blockchain-based data sharing network is a tenable solution for the complex 
problem of sharing healthcare data. 
6 Future Directions 
6.1 Aggregate Blockchains 
In this work, we've explored how nodes in a data sharing network may interact. Intuitively, we can con-
ceptualize these nodes as individual institutions or providers. This mental model aligns to current Heath 
Information Exchanges. which tend to be (at least in the United States) groupings of regional providers[29]. 
But what if we reconsider our definition of a node in the network? Envision a node not as a single institution, 
but as an entire blockebain-based data sharing network. We can now imagine not only cross-institutional 
sharing, but cross-network sharing as well. This would enable the institution/provider-based networks to 
grow and evolve, at the same time allowing them to connect to similar networks. This notion of aggregation, 
or nested blockchains, may be an approach to extending the reach of collaborations and sharing beyond local 
networks.
