unit CubeSat might cost as much as $400,000. Jeff Foust, an analyst at Futron, a consultancy, studies launch costs and 
says he has heard of charges as low as $30,000 for a single CubeSat launched on a Russian rocket. 
These prices put nanosats in the reach not just of small firms, but also of start-ups and researchers relying on academic 
grants. Some schools are also planning nanosat experiments. Bulk-buying launches for heavier combined payloads can 
work out, per kilo, even cheaper. And these costs could come down, too. Elon Musk, SpaceX's boss, has consistently 
predicted substantial price drops in launch costs, even to as little as $200 per kilo. The firm's Falcon 9 rocket recently 
demonstrated a successful controlled descent of its booster stage, which would allow it to be reused. 
Interorbital's nano rocket 
There is plenty of innovation in putting smaller payloads into space. Interorbital Systems, a Californian company, 
recently carried out a successful suborbital test flight of a small rocket (pictured right) designed to carry a 145kg 
payload. The company has presold berths for dozens of CubeSats at $13,000-38,000 per unit, as well as its own TubeSat 
format, which it offers to academia as kit and launch for $8,000. 
NASA will test an air-launched system in 2016 with Generation Orbit, an Atlanta company. It uses a Gulfstream G-IV 
executive jet to carry aloft a rocket which it fires off to put 45-50kg payloads into low-Earth orbit. NASA is also working 
with Virgin Galactic, a private space venture led by Richard Branson. Virgin Galactic has developed its LauncherOne, 
another air-launched rocket. It can be flown to a higher altitude and carry payloads up to 225kg. 
Neither Generation Orbit or Virgin Galactic may come down much on price, as both see a profit to be made in offering 
regular launches, even weekly ones. Operators whose nanosats ride shotgun as ballast in other missions do not have 
much control over when they launch or the orbits they reach, says William Pomerantz, the head of special projects at 
Virgin Galactic. John Olds, boss of Generation Orbit, says that as constellations of nanosats increase, placing them in a 
precise orbit will be critical in keeping small-satellite networks operating. 
The nanosat wars 
Nanosats also face two other limiting factors: communications and propulsion. Those used for academic work principally 
rely on amateur-radio frequencies, with basic equipment squeezed into the CubeSat form. Transmission and reception 
are further hindered by the size of antennae or dishes, both on the ground and on the satellites. Many academic 
projects set up their own listening stations and recruit space buffs who can use inexpensive kit, but these work on an 
informal basis. Companies tend to use licensed frequencies and plump for more expensive radio gear to handle their 
data flows. More development in communications equipment and investment in ground stations would improve things. 
The other bugbear, propulsion, is harder to solve. Currently, launch operators can prevent nanosats carrying hazardous 
propellants that might be used to power them to another orbit. Nor have engineers had a reason to design tiny 
spaceship engines using safer fuel. But they do now. Even a basic capability to push in one direction would allow 
nanosats to remain in orbit longer, or allow a satellite that has been placed into low-Earth orbit, using an inexpensive 
launch provider, to nudge itself to a higher geostationary orbit. And some might travel far beyond Earth. 
Benjamin Longmier of the University of Michigan and founder of Aether Industries, which makes equipment for high-
altitude research, has begun production of a nanosat propulsion system based on his previous work at the Johnson 
Space Centre in Texas. This is a rocket that uses ionised propellants accelerated by magnetic fields. He has been able to 
scale this down to CubeSat size, using liquid water or solid iodine as the propellant. Dr Longmier says the system could 
allow a constellation of satellites to remain in the correct position relative to one another, move satellites to polar orbit 
from less-expensive launch insertions or increase an orbit. 
Surrey Satellite Technology's STRaND-1 also contained a couple of experimental propulsion systems. One is a re-entry 
device that ejects a mixture of water and alcohol to tip the nanosat out of orbit at the end of its useful life. The other is
