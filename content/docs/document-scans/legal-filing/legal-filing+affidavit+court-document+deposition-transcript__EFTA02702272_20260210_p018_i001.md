The holders of a majority in principal amount of the debentures will have the right to direct the time, method 
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, subject to the provisions of the 
indenture. 
We are required to deliver a written statement to the trustee each year that states, to the knowledge of the 
officer making such statement, whether we have complied with all conditions and covenants under the terms of 
the indenture. 
The trustee will have no right or obligation under the indenture or otherwise to exercise any remedies on 
behalf of any holders of the debentures pursuant to the indenture in connection with any default, unless such 
remedies are available under the indenture and the trustee is directed to exercise such remedies by the holders of 
a majority in principal amount of the debentures pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the indenture. In 
connection with any such exercise of remedies, the trustee will be entitled to the same immunities and protections 
and remedial rights (other than acceleration) as if such default were an event of default. 
Transfer 
No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of debentures, but payment will 
be required of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection 
therewith. 
Listing 
We intend to apply to list the debentures on the NYSE under the symbol "WRB PR D7 If the application is 
approved, we expect trading of the debentures on the NYSE to begin within 30 days after they are first issued.

The information on additional amounts set forth under the heading "Description of the Debt Securities—
Payment of Additional Amounts" in the accompanying prospectus is amended and restated as set forth below. 
We will make all payments of principal of, and premium, if any, interest and any other amounts on, or in 
respect of, the debentures without withholding or deduction at source for, or on account of. any present or future 
taxes, fees, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of 
a taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such taxes, fees. 
duties, assessments or governmental charges arc required to be withheld or deducted by: 
• 
the laws, or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder, of a taxing jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or 
• 
an official position regarding the application, administration, interpretation or enforcement of any such 
laws, regulations or rulings, including, without limitation, a holding by a court of competent 
jurisdiction or by a taxing authority in a taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof. 
If a withholding or deduction at source is required, we will, subject to certain limitations and exceptions 
described below, pay to the holder of any such debenture such additional amounts as may be necessary• so that 
every net payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount made to such holder, after the 
withholding or deduction, will not be less than the amount provided for in such debenture and the indenture to be 
then due and payable.
