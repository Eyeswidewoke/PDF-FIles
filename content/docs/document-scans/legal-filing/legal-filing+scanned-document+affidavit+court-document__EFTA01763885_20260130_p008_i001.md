resources in building up a solid nuclear a=senal in Dimona. Today, according to various estimates, this stockpile 
com=rises some 100-300 devices, including two-stage thermonuclear warheads and a variety of delivery systems, the 
mo=t important of which are modern German-built submarines, which constitute =he backbone of Israel's second-strike 
capability. For Israel to give up =hese assets in the midst of an ongoing conflict strikes most Israelis as irrational. 
This consensus, how=ver, overlooks the fact that Israel's nuclear capability <=ont face="Times New Roman">has not 
played an important role in the country's defense. chttp://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1373=4/dmitry-
adamsky/why-israel-should-learn-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bom=?gp=134621:d83124a9SOadl8a2> [1] Unlike 
other nuclear-armed s=ates, Israel initiated its nuclear project not because of an opponent's real or imagined nuclear 
capability but bec=use of the worry that, in the long run, Arab conventional forces would out=trip the power of the 
Israel Defense Forces (IDF). As early as the 1950s, =sraeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion sought to manage the threat 
of modernizing Arab armies, which were inspire= by pan-Arab sentiment and backed by the Soviet Union, by developing 
the u=timate deterrent. Shimon Peres, the architect of Israel's nuclear progra= and now Israel's president, relentlessly 
argued in public speeches and writings that Israel needed to compensate fo= the large size of the Arab armies with 
"science" -- a code word for n=clear arms. 
As it turned out, h=wever, Arab conventional superiority never materialized. Ever since Israel=crossed the nuclear 
threshold on the eve of the 1967 war, the qualitative gap between Israel's conventional force= and those of its Arab 
neighbors has only grown. Today, particularly as th= Syrian army slowly disintegrates, the IDF could decisively rout any 
combi=ation of Arab (and Iranian) conventional forces. This advantage, combined with the United States' support for 
Isr=el, is what has kept Arab countries from taking up arms against the Jewish=state -- not the fear of nuclear retaliation. 
If, of course, Iran=were to obtain a nuclear weapon, the arsenal at Dimona would no longer be =rrelevant; it would be 
an important hedge against Iran. But far from being a secure balance, as the international re=ations theorist Kenneth 
Waltz has argued <http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1377=1/kenneth-n-waltz/why-iran-should-get-the-
bomb?gp=134957:57f66a6e5Oad183=> Fearing the prospec= of living in the shadow of such terror, many Israeli officials 
have openl= called for a military strike to halt Iran's nuclear program. They are spurred by anxieties that are deeply 
rooted in l=raeli culture, stemming from the trauma of the Holocaust and of two thousa=d years of perceived and real 
victimhood throughout the Jewish Diaspora. l=raeli leaders, particularly Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, now 
evince a belief that the country can rely=only on itself when it comes to ensuring its security and its existence.</=ont> 
The problem for Isr=el, however, is that a strike on Iran might carry grave consequences, espe=ially since the IDF cannot 
completely destroy Iran's nuclear infrastructure on its own. Israel can delay Iran's nucl=arization, but it cannot prevent 
it. Meanwhile, a military strike could pr=voke a great backlash, including missile and rocket attacks by Iran, Hezbo=lah, 
and Hamas on Israeli population centers. Just as worrisome, a strike would provide the Iranian regime with=a handy 
justification for its decision to go nuclear../p> 
And so Israel finds=itself in a strategic dilemma: it considers an Iranian bomb an existential=threat, but it cannot stop 
Iran's nuclearization by itself or without provoking an unpredictable backlash. 
Fortunately, Israel=has a way out of this strategic limbo: by agreeing to give up its nuclear =rsenal. Instead of rejecting 
the calls for a region free of weapons of mass destruction, Jerusalem could participate =n such an initiative -- joining in a 
similar sacrifice by all other region=l actors, including Iran. The conventional wisdom is that this would be a =ad bargain 
for Israel, giving up too much in exchange for too little. But such a bold move could set in mot=on a long-term process 
that might end the bitter stalemate over Iran's n=clear program. Iran has been calling for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
the=Middle East since 1974 and perceives the Israeli arsenal as a great threat, so it will have no choice but to su=port 
the initiative. And purely from a security perspective, Israel would =e safer in a WMD-free region. It would maintain its 
conventional superiori=y and its ability to deter conventional challenges -- all the while eliminating the prospect of 
nonconventional th=eats, such as an Iranian nuclear bomb or Syrian chemical weapons.</=pan>
