Permanent 
The preferential sex offender will try to find a way to keep his collection. He 
might move, hide, or give his collection to another offender if he believes law 
enforcement is investigating him. Although he might, he is not likely to destroy 
the collection because it is his life's work. In some cases he might even prefer that 
law enforcement seize and keep it intact in an evidence room where he might 
retrieve at least some of it when released from prison. One offender is known to 
have willed his' collection to a fellow pedophile. Another offender, knowing he 
would never get his child pornography back, still requested to go to the prosecutor's 
office to put his magazines in covers and dividers so they would not be damaged. 
Concealed 
Because of the hidden or illegal nature of the preferential sex offender's activity, 
he is concerned about the security of his collection. But this must always be 
weighed against his access to the collection. It does him no good if he cannot get 
to it. 
Where offenders hide their collections often depends on their living 
arrangements. If living alone or with someone aware of his illegal preferences, 
the collection will be less well concealed. It might be in a trunk, box, cabinet, 
bookcase, out in the open, or on a computer. The pornography might be better 
hidden than the erotica. If living with family members or others not aware of his 
activity, it will be better concealed. The collection might be found behind a false 
panel, in the ductwork, under insulation, or on a password-protected computer. 
The collection is usually in the pedophile's home, but it could be in an automobile 
or a camper, at his place of business, in a safety deposit box, or in a rented storage 
locker. The most difficult location to find is a secret place in a remote rural area. 
The investigator should search any area that is under the control of the offender. 
Again, computer technology has changed much of this. Computers and various 
types of disks make it possible to hide illegal and incriminating material in "plain 
sight." 
Shared 
The preferential sex offender frequently has a need or desire to show and tell 
others about his collection. He is seeking validation for all his efforts. The 
investigator can use this need to his or her advantage by showing interest in' the 
collection during any interview of an offender. The offender might appreciate the 
opportunity to brag about how much time, effort, and skill went into his 
collection. This need can also be exploited during proactive or undercover 
investigations. 
Investigators should not expect to find child pornography or erotica in all or even 
most cases involving the sexual victimization of children. It can be found in 
intrafamilial cases. It is most often found in cases involving preferential sex 
offenders especially pedophiles. Investigators can always attempt to get a warrant 
to search based on reliable case-specific information that a particular suspect pos-
sesses child pornography or other evidence of criminal behavior. 
During any investigation of child sexual victimization the possible presence of 
child pornography and erotica must be explored. For law-enforcement officers
