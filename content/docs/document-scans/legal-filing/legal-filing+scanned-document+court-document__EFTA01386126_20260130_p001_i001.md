Prime Broker Risks 
On page 17 of the Memorandum, under the Section headed 'Risk Factors", the following risk 
factors shall be inserted after the risk factor "Counterparly Risk": 
Prime Broker Insolvency The Master Fund is at risk of a Prime Broker entering into an 
insolvency procedure. During such a procedure (which may last many years) the use by the 
Master Fund of assets held by or on behalf of the relevant Prime Broker may be restricted or 
following close out, may be converted into cash, and accordingly (a) the ability of the Investment 
Manager to fulfil the investment objective may be severely constrained, (b) the Partnership may 
be required to suspend the calculation of the capital account balances and as a result 
subscriptions for and withdrawals, and/or (c) the value of the Partnership's net assets may be 
otherwise affected. During such a procedure, the Master Fund is likely to be an unsecured 
creditor in relation to certain assets and accordingly the Master Fund may be unable to recover 
such assets from the insolvent estate of the relevant Prime Broker, as the case may be, in full, or 
at all. 
In the event that a Prime Broker becomes insolvent and a liquidation proceeding is initiated under 
the United States Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, as amended ("SIPA"), the Master 
Fund would ordinarily be entitled to receive its pro rata share of customer property held by that 
Prime Broker based upon the net equity in its securities account with that Prime Broker. If the pro 
rata share that the Master Fund receives is less than 100% of the Master Fund's allowed net 
equity claim, the Master Fund would ordinarily be entitled to recover the amount of the shortfall up 
to specified statutory limits from a fund established under SIPA to reimburse customers of 
insolvent broker-dealers. If the Master Fund does not recover the full amount of its allowed net 
equity claim after receiving its pro rata share of customer property recovered from the insolvent 
broker-dealer's estate and maximum payment from the customer reimbursement fund established 
under SIPA, it will be a general unsecured creditor of the insolvent broker-dealer with respect to 
such remaining shortfall and, therefore, may not be able to recover the full amount or any of its 
net equity claim. 
Prime Brokers to the Master Fund In relation to the Master Fund's right to the return of assets 
equivalent to those of the Master Fund's investments which a Prime Broker lends to itself or 
others or pledges, repledges, hypothecates or rehypothecates, the Master Fund will rank as one 
of the relevant Prime Brokers unsecured creditors. In the event of the insolvency of a Prime 
Broker or a sub-custodian of a Prime Broker, the Master Fund would be entitled to receive its pro 
rata share of customer property held by the relevant Prime Broker in an amount equal to the net 
equity in its securities account with the relevant Prime Broker. If the pro rata share that the Master 
Fund receives is less than 100 per cent of what the relevant Prime Broker (the Master Fund will 
be entitled as a matter of law to the cash and marked-to-market value of the securities in its prime 
brokerage account, minus any indebtedness to the relevant broker-dealer), the Master Fund 
could recover cash or securities with a marked-to-market value of up to a specified statutory limit 
from a fund established under US law to reimburse customers of insolvent broker-dealers. If the 
Master Fund does not recover all cash and securities, including securities that have been 
rehypothecated, from its account with a broker-dealer after receiving its pro rata share of
