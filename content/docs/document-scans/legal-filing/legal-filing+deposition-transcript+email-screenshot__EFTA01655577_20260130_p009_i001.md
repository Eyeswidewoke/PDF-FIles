innovations. The court documents state that the trade secrets "contain detailed information about the architecture 
and functionality of TPU chips and systems and GPU systems, the software that allowed the chips to communicate 
and execute tasks, and the software that orchestrated thousands of chips into a supercomputer capable of training 
and executing cutting-edge Al workloads." NTD (02/05, Fang), and Regtech Times (02/05, Deshmukh) also reported

Opinion: My Vote to Ban TikTok Was a Mistake, Here's What I've Learned 
An opinion piece by Fox News (02/05, Hunt) stated that the author regretted for voting to ban TikTok. The author 
said they understood the concerns surrounding TikTok as a Chinese-owned platform and the potential risks 
associated with foreign access to American data, and they condemn foreign interference in our digital 
infrastructure, but that we must confront an uncomfortable truth: our government has also collected personal data 
on its citizens. The author noted that former Director Wray admitted to Congress that the FBI abused its powers to 
spy on Americans over 250,000 times. The author claimed that for conservatives who believe in a strong America, 
platforms like TikTok and X remain vital spaces for free speech, and that we must break the cycle of censorship and 
ensure that every American has the right to express their beliefs without fear of being silenced or "canceled." The 
author closed by saying that as leaders, we must adapt to the realities of the modern world, recognizing that 
platforms like TikTok are not merely distractions, but potent tools for communication, activism, and education.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Burglaries at Homes of Joe Burrow and Other Star Athletes Were Similar, Authorities Say 
The Associated Press (02/05, Collins) reported that the men charged with a burglary at Cincinnati Bengals 
quarterback Joe Burrow's house took photos of themselves flashing some of the spoils — nearly $300,000 worth of 
jewelry, watches, designer luggage and glasses. The article disclosed that one of them wore necklaces with 
pendants showing the number 9 and "JB9," Burrow's jersey number. The article noted that one of the men tried to 
delete the photos from a cellphone as police pulled them over in Ohio, but investigators were able to recover the 
pictures and included some of them in a new federal complaint filed by an FBI agent that was unsealed Wednesday. 
The investigation has spanned several states and led to the arrests of six people. According to the article, federal 
authorities say it's a story involving South American burglary crews that have been targeting upscale homes around 
the country and a fencing operation run out of a New York City pawn shop. The article clarified that in court 
documents, investigators haven't publicly connected the Dec. 9 burglary at Burrow's home in Cincinnati to other 
thefts reported at other high-profile athletes' houses, but the complaint released Wednesday said there were 
similarities in many of the break-ins and the investigation is ongoing. On Wednesday, three of the four men already 
accused by local authorities of burglarizing Burrow's home were indicted by a federal grand jury in Cincinnati on 
charges of transporting stolen goods interstate and falsifying records related to the same burglary. The article 
added that additionally on Wednesday, two other men charged with running a fencing operation in New York City 
selling stolen items from burglaries around the country pleaded not guilty through their attorneys in federal court 
in Brooklyn. Investigators alleged one of the men was linked through phone records to one of the men charged in 
the Burrow home theft. The article outlined that those two men, Dimitriy Nezhinskiy and Juan Villar, were 
identified by authorities in court documents released Tuesday. Prosecutors said a large amount of suspected stolen 
property was found at the two men's pawn shop in Manhattan and at storage units in New Jersey belonging to 
Nezhinskiy. The article further revealed that in the criminal complaint released Wednesday, an FBI agent wrote that 
authorities tracked the suspects in the theft at Burrow's home to a hotel in Fairborn, Ohio, near Dayton, using 
cellphone location data and license plate readers. Investigators said they matched data from cell towers to the 
locations of a vehicle of interest identified by the license plate readers. Local prosecutors said four men were later 
taken into custody during a traffic stop — Jordan Francisco Quiroga Sanchez, 22; Alexander Esteban Huaiquil-
Chavez, 24; Bastian Alejandro Orellana Morales, 23; and Sergio Andres Ortega Cabello, 38. Sanchez, Morales and 
Cabello were indicted by the federal grand jury Wednesday. CNN (02/05, Harvey, et al.) highlighted that the FBI 
said, "These homes are targeted for burglary due to the perception they may have high-end goods like designer 
handbags, jewelry, watches, and cash." CBS News (02/05, Gainer), ABC News (02/05, Katersky, Deliso), The New
