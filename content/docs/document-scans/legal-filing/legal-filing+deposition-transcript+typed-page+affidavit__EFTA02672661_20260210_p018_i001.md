improvisational. Only a few performers, including contemporaries Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, and the 
Four Tops, showed the refined style that would be popularized by the Temptations. 
Producer Berry Gordy insisted that all his acts be equally appealing to both white as well as black 
audiences, and employed an extensive creative team to help tailor Motown talent for the crossover 
success he desired. Motown choreographer Cholly Atkins along with Paul Williams created the 
trademark precise and energetic, yet refined, dance steps used by the Temptations onstage. The most 
famous of these, the "Temptation Walk", or "Temptation Strut", was adapted from similar moves by the 
Flamingos and the Vibrations and from those two sources, Cholly Atkins and Paul Williams crafted the 
resulting signature dance routine. 
Like other similar independent companies of the period, Motown was neither a member of ASCAP nor 
BMI, preferring to stay independent and handling their own widely varied distribution through 
thousands of "Mom & Pop" record stores and small radio stations. Many singles that might have been 
charted higher did not have the data for the Billboard charts to evaluate, so it is quite possible that the 
Temptations sold more than a "Gold Record" number of most of their early records. Their stage work 
and depth of their lead singers made them legends throughout the northern cities as well as the 
southern "chitlin' circuit", before being acknowledged by most radio disc jockeys as the strongest group 
around. 
During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of soul groups showed significant influence from the 
Temptations, among them the Delfonics, the Chi-Lites, Parliaments, featuring George Clinton, the 
Dramatics, Daryl Hall & John Oates (from 1965 to 1967 one of Daryl Hall's earliest bands was named The 
Temptones), and Motown labelmates the Jackson 5 and The Undisputed Truth. These acts, and others, 
showed the influence of the Temptations in both their vocal performances and their onstage 
choreography. Several more recent soul and R&B vocal groups, including New Edition led by Johnny Gill, 
Jodeci, BLACKstreet, Dru Hill, and, most notably, Boyz II Men in the 1980s also showed significant 
influence from the Temptations. 
It is interesting to note that during the early part of their career, their main competition came from 
Impressions featuring Curtis Mayfield; then during the phase of the group featuring alternating leads, 
competition came from Sam & Dave, the Chi-Lites. In their next phase, competition came from the 
(nays. In each case, each group alternated between love songs and songs with messages in their lyrics. 
Temptations songs have been covered by scores of musicians, from R&B singers such as Luther Vandross 
("Since I Lost My Baby"), to pop vocalists such as Bette Midler ("Just My Imagination"), to rock bands 
such as Rare Earth ("Get Ready"), Anthrax, Love and Rockets, Duran Duran ("Ball of Confusion (That's 
What the World Is Today)") and the Rolling Stones ("My Girl", "Ain't Too Proud to Beg", "Just My 
Imagination") and Mick Jagger's collaboration with reggae artist Peter Tosh on ("Don't Look Back"). 
British rock singer Rod Stewart released a cover of "I'm Losing You" in 1971; in 1991, he collaborated 
with the Temptations on the single "The Motown Song".
