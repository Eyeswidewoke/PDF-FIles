Update post speaking with 
Management 
Research Analyst 
We spoke to AEGR management regarding their plans for 2014 and are 
updating our model to reflect the information. In particular we are raising our 
SG&A expenses in 2014 in-line with the company's plans to invest in sales and 
marketing. Our model also reflects the company guidance of becoming 
profitable in 2H'14. Notably, the co would provide 2014 guidance at JPM 
conference early next year. 
Incremental color on SG&A increase. Invest upfront with 3 year outlook. 
Acc to management, they believe it is more prudent to invest in SG&A keeping 
a 3 year outlook and invest upfront for those years. The co would be increasing 
sales force substantially in 2014 instead of increasing sales force every year. 
Before the launch of Juxtapid, the co guided for 15 sales reps in the US. We 
believe the number is higher now and is expected to increase. 
Focus on customer care to help with prescriptions/reimbursement 
The co will be making investments in all three buckets of SG&A 1) sales, 2) 
marketing and 3) medical affairs. The co expects to make substantial 
investments in customer care reps who take care of reimbursement and 
prescription generation. The co. launched with 4 customer care reps and now 
have 8 such reps. The co expects to increase this to 20 by YE 2013 and to 40 
by YE 2014.We are now modeling 2014 SG&A expenses at S1 25M vs. S95M 
prey. This is -671450M) higher vs. current SG&A run rate of $75M (Or 13). 
Guidance foist! in 
I.: was a refkietion of inanniiement 
be 
likely 
tortie in line with the guidance 
Management style is conservative at the beginning of the year but likely will be 
in-line toward end of year. The company seems confident of achieving 2013 
guidance as the company has good visibility about scripts which would lead to 
new patient starts in 4Q. 40'13 numbers would likely come in-line in given 
management style. This guidance assumes shipping delays due to some 
patients delaying treatment which comes with diet modifications till holidays 
end. The guidance also accounts for less shipping days in 4Q. 
Given the increase in expenses, we are now modeling the company becoming 
profitable in 211'14 which is In-line with the guidance. 
2014 to be reimbursement year in the EU. Consensus might be high 
Management also noted that 2014 would be the year of reimbursement 
negotiations in the EU and they do not expect substantial revenues from the 
EU in 2014. The company expects most of the EU companies to come online 
by the end of 2014.We are reducing our EU revenues to $10M vs. $13M 
previous and note that consensus is at $17M for 2014 EU revenues. 
SBC to increase in 2014 due to stock price increase. We are raising SBC to 
$30M vs. $25M previous. 
We reiterate Buy with St 15 TP.
