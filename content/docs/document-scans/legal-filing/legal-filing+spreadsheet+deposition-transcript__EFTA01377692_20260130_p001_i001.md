Quarterly Results of Operations 
The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight quarters. The 
information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included 
elsewhere in this prospectus and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring 
adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods. This data should be read in 
conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. These 
quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results we may achieve in future periods.
