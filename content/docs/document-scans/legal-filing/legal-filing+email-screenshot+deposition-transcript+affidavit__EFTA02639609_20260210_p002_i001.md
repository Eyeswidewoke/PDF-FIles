I know that both you and I heard brads'. im out of here if i dont =et a coo. . sorry,. i know that neither of us have stood 
in the way =f his finding/ gettting one.. JPM account DB account GS account, ???=C2 its MAY 1. nothing in the first 
quarter and these are only papers that ne=d signing. 
I suggest your thinking on my role and compensation for my work might benefit , from a mental shift - =hink mark and 
josh, without the mutual resentment ( HAHA) only in terms of=20 sharing ,thanks, I am and have been your financial 
partn=r i.. rectifying circumstances that appear in hind sight unexplrinable. I wish you woudl have asked me earllier 
to review your things, but i understand. I do know that soley as a result of my actions you= personal bottom line has 
increased dramatica=ly, if you had thought of me as your partner in this endeavor , instead of an employee, i think 
your reaction to sharing t benefits would be different. 
If you recall, you wanted me to be prid , unlike others at the END of my work. we discussed this ad nauseum, =AO and 
agreed OCT 15, last year was the end . You had wanted more comf=rt initially on the art partnership so that date was 
delayed. It h=s now been six monhts since then, your concept of aftercare . .=C2 for free. was already unique , in 
your words this has to have an end.( w=aned ) if the actions of josh and mark led to one =undred million dollars , 
what would be their share. 
Im not sure why it =s different in your mind. but i respect the fact that it is, Is it because 
their=20 work seems harder. it cannot be simply because they=devote more time to you .or it appears to involve more 
effort. I am happy to co=tinue to play a partnership role. as I have been in many areas of your lif=.. I am also happy to 
move on and have no more of these emails. =1 find them as tedious as you do . if you prefer a partnership structure , =k 
with me, I tried to minimize the amount of money i would recieve by=20 making it a flat fee . as i wanted you to feel 
good and have no second thoguths somehow if the payment comes from a partnership struc=ure you seem relaxed as 
opposed to writing a check, I focus on =AO trust and friendship first, and the fact that you don't include josh and mark 
in=20 that category, gives me great pause . I proposed 33 perc=nt of money made for you. . in the past you agreed 
that amount. it will b= huge, but ok with me, I can talk today at 945 as yo= suggested. or if you woudl rather over the 
weekend ok
