No directional cues emerged after the last FOMC meeting. The net effect is 
essentially a distributional modification, a swelling of the tails - the 
probabilities of rates moving both higher and lower have increased, at the 
expense of the likelihood of staying within the range. The novelty of the 
Fed communication this time was the mechanism whereby Fed consensus 
is converted into the market dissensus. Fed language became a pure 
volatility effect. 
In this environment any residual overweight in assets for which valuation 
has been distorted by monetary policy so far is likely to come under 
scrutiny and possibly be corrected. That should free some maneuvering 
space for the Fed and make potential hikes less damaging and thus 
possibly more likely. As far as an attempt to return vol to the markets, this 
is mission accomplished.

We are buyers of tail risk at the short end of the curve in the mid-run: 
• 
Sell $100mn 8M10Y 8bp wide strangles vs. buy $325mn 3M3Y straddles 
costiess 
• 
Sell $100mn f3M3Y straddles vs. buy $200mn 60bp wide 8M3Y strangles 
confess 
In our view, risk assets are at a bifurcation point - their future path 
depends on the way the economy and stimulus unwind interact with one 
other. We are buyers of hybrid S&P calls and puts conditioned on different 
rates responses to the Fed. We recommend: 
• 
18-Dec-2015 SPX 95% put subject to Ss > ATMF t 25 , offer 1.15%, an 
73% discount to vanilla at 4.30% 
• 
18-Dec-2015 SPX 103% call subject to 10a < fwd-25bp at expliy, offer 
1.00%, a 70% discount to vanilla at 3.37% 
From Fed consensus to market dissensus: Volatility could 
be here to stay 
The last FOMC could be seen as a template for what to expect in the near term. 
Two parts of the statement cause this. The combined statement reflects the 
divided subject of the future economic path and sets the terrain for a period of 
elevated volatility across various market sectors. Lowering of the NAIRU, the 
dovish side, means either we do not have the right model or, if we do, then we 
do not know how to calibrate it. It is not even clear that the U3 unemployment 
rate is the relevant statistic in this context. Either way, this means that there is 
relatively low confidence regarding the point at which the economy will turn 
around and the Fed would need to consider hikes seriously. The other side of 
the Fed's statement is the dots. Despite the dovish overtones conveyed by a 
lower median, the most relevant message is the emergence of a strong 
consensus, which is in sharp contrast with previous dot plots. As far as the 
end of 2015 is concerned, there is consensus that there should be two hikes by 
the end of the year (and four more in 2016).
