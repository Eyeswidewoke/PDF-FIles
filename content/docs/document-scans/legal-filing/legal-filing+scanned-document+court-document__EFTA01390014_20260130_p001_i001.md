investments and does not intend to conduct investment or operational due diligence with 
respect to the underlying fund vehicle. Accordingly. there is the risk that iCapital may not 
detect conflicts of interest, fraudulent behavior or administrative or operational weaknesses 
within the Fund that may give rise to substantial losses.
