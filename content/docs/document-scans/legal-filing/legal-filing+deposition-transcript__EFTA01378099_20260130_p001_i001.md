On November 15, 2013 and December 2t, 2012, IAC issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due November 30 2018 (-2013 
Senior Notes') and $500 million aggregate principal amount or 4.75% Senior Notes due December 15. 2022 ('2012 Senior Notes"). respectively. The 2013 and 
2012 Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Match Group. Inc. and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. 
The indentures governing the 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the ability of IAC's restricted subsidiaries to, among other things. 
(i) incur indebtedness, make investments, or sell assets in the event IAC is not in compliance with the financial ratio set forth in the indenture. and (ii) incur 
liens. enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends. enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or sell all or 
substantially all of IAC's assets. At December 31. 2014. IAC was in compliance with the financial ratio set forth in the indenture. 
On December 21, 2012. IAC entered into a $300 million revolving credit facikty, which expires on December 21, 2017. At December 31. 2014 and 2013. there 
are no outstanding borrowings under IAC's revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the same domestic subsidiaries 
that guarantee the 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes and is also secured by the stock of Match Group, Inc. and certain of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. 
The Company has not recorded a liability pursuant to this guarantor obligation because we have not agreed to pay a specific amount through an arrangement 
with our co-obligors and we do not expect to pay any amount as a result of our guarantee of IAC's Senior Notes and IAC's revolving credit facility. Prior to the 
dosing of this offering, we will no longer be a restricted subsidiary of IAC for the purposes of its debt facilities, nor will we guarantee any debt of IAC nor will 
the stock of any of our subsidiaries be pledged to secure IAC's debt. 
Relationship with IAC following the initial public offering 
We expect to enter into certain agreements with MC relating to this offering and our relationship with IAC after this offering to govern the relationship between 
the Company and IAC. These agreements will include: a master transaction agreement; an investor rights agreement; a tax sharing agreement; a services 
agreement: an employee matters agreement: and a subordinated loan agreement.
