business. 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions 
with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the 
combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent 
management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional 
managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills. knowledge or experience necessary to 
enhance the incumbent management. 
Stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. 
However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may 
decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic 
explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is 
currently require) under Delaware law for each such transaction.

Purchase of assets 
No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company 
No

Ycs 
Whether 
Stockholder 
Approval is 
Required 
Under NASDAQ's listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination 
if, for example: 
• we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common 
stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering); 
• any of our dimetors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater 
interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target 
business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could 
result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or 
• the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
Permitted purchases of our securities 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in 
connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules. our sponsor, directors, officers, 
advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either 
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current 
commitments. plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or 
83 
conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in 
such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public 
information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange 
Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record 
holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption 
rights. Subsequent to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt an insider trading policy which will require 
insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of 
any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We 
cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it 
will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to. the timing and size of such purchases. 
Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or 
determine that such a plan is not necessary. 
In the event that our sponsor. directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately 
negotiate) transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, 
such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not 
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any. would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules 
under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; 
however• if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules.
