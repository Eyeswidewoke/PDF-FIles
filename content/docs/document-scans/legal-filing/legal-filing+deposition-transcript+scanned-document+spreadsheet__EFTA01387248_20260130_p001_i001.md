o Trump intends to sign USMCA (or NAFTA 2.0), maybe in Argentina during G20 meeting where everyone will be 
watching him and President Xi 
o If we see a Democratic house: 
• Earlier this year, Dems put out publication that outlined out what they would do if they were in control 
• Many of these match with Trump's agenda: infrastructure spending, lowering prescription drug prices , Immigration 
issues, criminal justice reform, etc. 
o The Fed 
• The larger the margin of victory for Republicans in Senate, the better the news for Powell, If Trump continues to push 
on him, a stronger Republican Senate would be more defensive of him 
o Trade 
• Too early to know if Cabinet request is just Trump shaking the tree, or something real. Also notable-there are Dems in 
Senate who are strongly in opposition to China's trade policy 
o Trump 
• Could see him changing gears to work with Dems on infrastructure; really the only pillar of his campaign he hasn't yet 
addressed 
• Mueller to report to boss on report in coming weeks-but dangerous to speculate too soon

What have we been seeing on the desk 
o Enormous sector rotation theme, bid towards sector ETF in anticipation of sector moves 
o Used to be the case that midterm elections were not events that markets priced in a move for, but given recent rally 
off local lows, now seeing midterm election point as the highest point across curves 
o Overall event risk is not too much higher than the general event risk priced in everyday, given volatility we've been 
having 
• 
Flows 
o Notable change in sentiment over past 48 hour: Instead of rolling down puts, we are seeing a lot of upside call 
buying 
• Some in macro space, but a lot in single names, financials, tech stocks; wave of call buying picked up intensity 
yesterday 
• A lot of names being bought could potentially get boost from GOP maintaining house majority in 30% scenario, but still 
seeing buying across the board 
• General consensus is we probably do rally out of midterm into the year-end 
• 
Year End 
o A lot of good academic data out there by DB research about general uncertainty effect easing coming out of 
midterm elections 
o Think significant probability we rally into year end and out of midterm give that positioning lighter and sentiment 
shifting 
• Have not seen panic from clients 
• Clearly still in high vol market and even if we were to rally, would be in straight line which points to owning optionality 
• 
Vol regime we are in is very different from past 
o Use to be a buy dip, sell vol environment 
o This time it's a growth story, no one day will decide growth is back on, but will come over time as a result of 
information filtering into market 
o Will be a medium vol regime for a while, make sure can withstand drawdowns 
• 
Slight premium to election so not anticipate vols meaningfully drop off only slightly, we are not going back to VIX 
sub 16 world any time soon 
o 17-25 VIX level range into end of the year 
o Vol curve is the flattest we've seen in past 3 weeks meaning 1.25% pricing in SPX move is roughly 
o Bottom line: vol not pricing in a ton on the event 
II. Midterms Keeping Near Term Vols Bid — Sell to Fund Year End
