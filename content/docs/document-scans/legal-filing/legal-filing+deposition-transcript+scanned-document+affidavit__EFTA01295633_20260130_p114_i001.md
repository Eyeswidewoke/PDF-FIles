2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
extended credit arrangements, which suggested to Plaintiff that Specialty was financially 
reliable, (id., ¶¶ 72(c)-(d)); that BIC communicated directly with Brito regarding Specialty's 
transactions, further demonstrating BIC's superior position of knowledge and leading the 
Plaintiff to place more confidence and trust in BIC, (id., ¶ 16); and that when the Plaintiff 
directed inquiries to BIC regarding Specialty's ability to make payments, BIC advised the 
Plaintiff not to worry and reminded the Plaintiff that it could trust BIC, (id., ¶ 72(a)-(b)). 
Based upon this alleged course of dealings, the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a fiduciary 
or confidential relationship between the Plaintiff and BIC. See Express Oil Change, LLC v. 
ANB Ins. Services, Inc., 933 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1351-52 (N.D. Ala. 2013) (finding that a 
confidential relationship existed between the plaintiff and its insurance broker when the 
broker NO] "inspired confidence in [the plaintiff] that [it] would act in good faith for its 
interests"). Furthermore, the Plaintiff has adequately alleged that BIC owed a duty to 
disclose arising from their fiduciary or confidential relationship. See Hinds, 55 So. 3d at 
231-34 (concluding that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that the defendants owed a duty to 
disclose arising from their confidential and fiduciary relationship with the defendants when 
they alleged, among other things, that they "entrusted [the defendants] with the negotiation 
of [the transaction] based on [the defendants'] superior experience and knowledge"); State 
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Ling, 348 So. 2d 472, 474-76 (Ala. 1977) (holding that an 
insurer owed a duty to disclose arising from its confidential relationship with the plaintiff 
where the plaintiff developed trust and confidence in his insurer through their course of 
dealings in which the insurer made assurances that it would take care of the plaintiff's 
interests). 
Moreover, even if a confidential relationship did not arise from the alleged facts, the 
undersigned finds that a duty to disclose on the part of BIC could arise from the particular 
circumstances of this case. When determining whether a duty arises under the particular 
circumstances of a case, the [-51] court shall consider the following factors: "(1) the 
relationship of the parties; (2) the relative knowledge of the parties; (3) the value of the 
particular fact; (4) the plaintiffs' opportunity to ascertain the fact; (5) the customs of the 
trade; and (6) other relevant circumstances." Freightliner, 932 So. 2d at 891 (quoting 
Armstrong Bus. Services, Inc. v. AmSouth Bank, 817 So. 2d 665, 677 (Ala. 2001)) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
The first four factors identified in Freightliner all weigh in favor of finding a duty, should the 
proof ultimately support the Plaintiffs allegations?' The relationship of the parties weighs in 
favor of finding a duty because the Plaintiff alleges that BIC is the Plaintiffs exclusive 
broker and agent, that Pappaceno had handled the Plaintiff's transactions with Specialty 
for several years and that Pappaceno and BIC fostered a relationship whereby the Plaintiff 
trusted and relied on Pappaceno and BIC's representations regarding Specialty. The 
knowledge of the parties supports the finding of a duty because the Plaintiff has alleged 
that BIC had far superior knowledge based on its direct access to Specialty's business 
operations and BIC's insistence that the Plaintiff not contact Specialty. Similarly, the 
Plaintiff was less likely to ascertain the facts at ['52] issue because BIC had established 
that the Plaintiffs inquiries regarding Specialty should be directed to BIC. The value of the 
facts at issue--Specialty's financial instability and the lack of collateral securing 
transactions with Specialty—supports the finding of a duty because the Plaintiff alleges 
that, had it known those facts, it would have ceased doing business with Specialty and
