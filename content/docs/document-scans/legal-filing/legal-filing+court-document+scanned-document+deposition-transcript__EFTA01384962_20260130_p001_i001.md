Determination of Fair Value 
In determining the fair value of our investments in real estate, we have historically relied on 
independent, third•party appraisal firms that employ a certified appraiser with local knowledge and 
expertise who is certified as either an A.R.A. or MAI. appraiser or state certified as a Certified 
General Real Estate Appraiser and who performed their formal appraisals as of December 31 in each 
calendar year for each property, and then updated such appraisals each quarter thereafter, with 
properties acquired between the fourth quarter of a calendar year and the December of the following 
year being held at their respective costs until formally appraised. See "Experts" for a list of our third 
party appraisers. Our independent auditors have not audited or reviewed these appraisals. Each 
property in our portfolio was most recently appraised as of June 30, 2015 other than Falcon Farms, the 
second parcel of Kimberly Vineyard, the second parcel of Golden Eagle Ranch and Kingfisher Ranch, 
all of which were acquired between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the date of this prospectus and are 
held at cost. 
Each full appraisal was prepared in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional 
Appraisal Practice and utilized at least one of the following three approaches to value: 
(i) the cost approach, which establishes value by estimating the current costs of reproducing the 
improvements (less loss in value from depreciation) and adding land value to it; 
(ii) the income capitalization approach, which establishes value indicated by the subject property's 
net earning power based on the capitalization of income; and/or 
(iii) the comparable sales approach, which establishes value indicated by recent sales of 
comparable properties in the market place, 
with each approach leading to a final opinion of the appraised value of the subject property by the 
appraiser. The income capitalization approach is very sensitive to the final capitalization rate chosen, 
with small changes in the capitalization rate resulting in significant changes in market value. Factors 
considered during the land valuation process utilized for the comparable sales approach, include, 
among others, prominence of location, size, shape, availability of utilities, zoning, topography, property 
rights, financing, property improvements, market conditions and land use mix. Though the three 
approaches arc interrelated and one or more of the approaches may be selected by the appraiser 
depending on applicability, generally in the appraisal of agricultural property, the comparable sales 
approach is most often utilized. In the case of our development properties, the cost approach tends to 
be more frequently relied upon due to the lack of (i) income (as the properties arc under development 
and are not bearing crops that generate commercial income) and (ii) comparable sales of cropland 
farms undergoing development (sales are typically either of raw land or of mature farms), and in the 
early years of development until the farm is producing a commercially viable crop. despite the 
potentially significant capital expenditures, development properties are often compared to raw land, 
which may significantly undervalue the property. 
Our portfolio is comprised of 18 farms with approximately 16,136 gross acres with more than 21 
crop varieties throughout six states and various USDA regions. Consequently, each appraisal is unique 
and certain of the factors reviewed and evaluated in each appraisal are particular to the geography, 
climate, crop type and pricing, market area and market trends associated with the relevant property. 
I lowever, in performing their analyses, the appraisers generally (i) performed site visits to the 
properties. (ii) consulted with knowledgeable real estate brokers, property managers, real estate 
appraisers and general contractors, among others, (iii) performed independent inspections and/or 
surveys of the market area and neighborhood, (iv) performed a highest and best use analysis, 
(v) discussed each property with our Agricultural Sub-Adviser and reviewed property-level information, 
including, but not limited to, existing lease agreements and ownership history, farm acreage, location, 
soil quality/productivity, availability of utilities, topography, land improvements, zoning trends, access to
