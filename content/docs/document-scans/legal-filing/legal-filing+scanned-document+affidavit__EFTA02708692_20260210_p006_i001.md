What so many Americ=ns, including their leaders in government, have long failed to understand =s that this was what 
bin Laden and AI-Qaeda wanted all along. The intent o= the bloody attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon 
was to lure the U.S. and its allies into attacking=the Middle East. Bin Laden was quite open about that. 
Such a war, he beli=ved, would unify Muslims and then lead to an enormous victory that would d=ive the West to 
withdraw from all of the Middle East. From there, bin Lade= wanted to set off a Sunni revolution that would topple 
secular, Western-supported governments in the Arab world=and confront Shiites, whom he deeply opposed. In fact, ISIL 
has proclaimed=that the current confrontation isn't a war between Iraq's government a=d Islamists, but Sunnis vs. 
Shiites. 
For those who didn=92t understand prior to the American invasion of Iraq about this boiling c=uldron of tribal hate that 
played so important a role in Middle Eastern se=urity, the evidence grew stronger throughout the war. AI-Qaeda and its 
affiliated organizations have killed untold thou=ands of Shiites in the past 11 years—in particular, in Iraq. In fact, 
in=2007, groups in Kuwait that pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda issued a fatwa=97a legal pronouncement by a religious 
scholar—against the Shiite government in Iran. 
From the beginning,=this has been the irreparable flaw in the American strategy to topple the =raqi government of 
Saddam Hussein. Saddam was a brutal and murderous dicta=or, but as a secular Sunni who ruled with an iron, bloody 
fist, he was able to crush the fundamentalist threat.=But once the Sunni government was driven from power and the 
Iraqi military=disbanded by the Americans, its members joined forces with the more threat=ning Islamists among its 
tribal brethren. 
The American plan w=s for Iraq to be ruled by a cooperative government between the majority se=t, the Shiites, and the 
minority Sunnis. But this idea of cooperative lead=rship between the Hatfields and the McCoys was always destined to 
collapse—hundreds of years of war were not=going to be set aside just because the West demanded it. 
The Sunnis who atte=pted to join the new political order were soon marginalized. Their almost =oken representation 
intensified bubbling Sunni anger about perceived discr=mination and inequality. Making it all the worse has been the 
leadership of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Mal=ki, who has made every effort to destroy any credible leadership among 
the=Sunnis attempting to join the government. 
According to a repo=t by the International Crisis Group, a nongovernmental group that works on=conflict resolution, 
Maliki has cast out prominent Sunni leaders on the ba=is of their connections to Saddam's Bath Party and has 
disproportionately deployed government security forces =n the Sunni neighborhoods of Baghdad and Sunni 
governorates. 
The primary politic=l movement of the Sunnis—Al-Iraqiya—fell apart as Maliki strove to con=olidate his and the Shiites' 
power. A major sign of Sunni impotence in l=aq came in late 2012 with the arrest of the bodyguards a prominent 
member of Al-lraqiya. Sunnis launched an extraordin=ry, peaceful protest movement, only to see a response of further 
repressio=. 
The result? Intensi=ying support among Sunnis for the only remaining option—insurgency. The =igns of a growing 
possibility of civil war became more evident in the summ=r of last year as the number of car bombings swelled across 
the country. 
Of course, the Iraq= security forces were supposed to have been able to protect the country by=now. Instead, they have 
melted away in the face of the oncoming march of 1=11. In part, that is also Maliki's fault. He ended the on-the-ground 
training of his forces by U.S. military =dvisers too soon—and over American objections. And this poorly trained, 
=ndisciplined group were fully aware that the far stronger, far better Syri=n military struggled and experienced 
significant losses in the early confrontations against ISIL and other jiha=ists in their country.
