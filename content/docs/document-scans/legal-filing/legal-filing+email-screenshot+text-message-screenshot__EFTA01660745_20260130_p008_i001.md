FBI in New York Looking to Identify 900+ Victims of Online Porn Marketplace 
The New York Post (07/02, Gibbon) reported that a top FBI agent took to X on Tuesday to personally plead 
for more than 900 suspected victims of an accused child and adult-porn peddler to contact the agency. 
The article noted that the move comes six months after Kyle White, 25, "The Ho Zone" creator, was 
busted for allegedly targeting hundreds of unsuspecting online users by plucking their images and selling 
them to subscribers on the Telegram messaging app under the name THZ Admin. The article quoted FBI 
New York Special Agent in Charge Leslie Backschies who said in a video on X, "Some of the victims include 
social media influencers, NCAA and semi-professional athletes, actresses, models, teenagers and victims 
of blackmail or sextortion, if you or someone you know suspects that White shared your private images 
or videos without permission, please report it." The article stated that federal prosecutors charged White 
with two counts of receipt, distribution, and advertisement of child pornography in January, calling his 
alleged illicit online sex market "abhorrent and depraved." The FBI is asking victims to come forward by 
visiting the THZ Victim site and filling out a short form with the agency promising that the information will 
remain confidential. WHAM (CBS-6) (07/02, Staff Writer) also reported on the story.

place of work, I commend the investigative efforts and achievements of the FBI's Benton Harbor Safe 
Streets Task Force and our local, state, and federal partners for their dedication to this case. Nevertheless,

Continued Reporting: New Grand Jury Transcripts Released in Jeffrey Epstein Case 
Reveal Prosecutors Knew About Accusations 
CBS News (07/02, Duncan, Hoffman) reported that a Florida judge on Monday unveiled 150 pages of 
grand jury transcripts from 2006 that looked into sex trafficking and rape allegations made against 
financier Jeffrey Epstein. The newly released documents from 18 years ago unveiled by Palm Beach 
County Circuit Judge Luis Delgado revealed that prosecutors knew about detailed accusations against 
Epstein — years before the financier was given a sweetheart deal. The article noted that according to 
2006 testimony, the investigation against Epstein began a year earlier. Two victims were questioned 
during the proceedings — including one who alleged that Epstein, then in his 50s, molested her when she 
was 14 years old. The second victim said she was raped by Epstein the day before her 18th birthday. A 
detective on the case testified that victims were paid for the sex acts and encouraged to recruit other 
underage girls and told "the younger, the better." The article mentioned that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis 
signed a bill in February allowing the release of the documents on July 1 or afterward. Florida grand jury 
transcripts are usually kept secret, but the bill created an exemption for cases like Epstein's. The article
