More than 60% of foreign c=rrency reserves have evaporated, talk about a program of economic reform i= not just 
necessary, it is crucial 
Adel al-Toraifi 
Those who hold this opinio= believe that domestic demand will prevent the Egyptian economy from facin= bankruptcy. 
But hold on—this view is based more on the sense of Egyptian national dignity, rather than the language o= numbers. 
Brazil and Mexico would have announced bankruptcy during the 198=s were it not for the intervention of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF= and the World Bank. Everybody knows how countries like Chile in 1975 and 
Yugoslavia in 1989 and Nicaragu= in 1990 went bankrupt, or, to put it in the language of economists, exper=enced huge 
inflation and the collapse of the national economy. 
Let us take Argentina in t=e 1980$ as an example. Argentina borrowed in a way that repayments became = heavy 
burden, and following the loss of political stability in the country—as is happening today in Egypt—inte=national lenders 
refused to help. As a result, the country had no choice b=t to devalue its currency in order to reduce the value of its 
debt. This w=s a way of announcing bankruptcy. 
Egyptian vulnerability 
Is the Egyptian treasury v=lnerable to bankruptcy? Not yet, but if it continues on this course then t=ere can be no doubt 
that this will be its fate. There can also be no doubt that some people are relying on Western o= Gulf assistance; nobody 
wants to see the Egyptian treasury declare bankru=tcy, as it would have political and security consequences for 
everybody.4=ont> 
However, at the same time,=the Egyptian government is not helping itself or allowing others to help i= to fix the 
situation. What does it mean for Kandil to name an al-Azhar professor specializing in Islamic jurisprud=nce and 
murabaha (Sharia-compliant sale) as the country's new finance mi=ister? What does specializing in Islamic studies have 
to do with the USD 4=8 billion interest-based IMF loan? The answer is that this minister was appointed simply because 
he is affili=ted with the Muslim Brotherhood, and he only has the power to pass directi=es—not to implement the 
required corrective plan.</=pan> 
Although the judgment agai=st the new finance minister may come a little early, would it not have bee= better to 
choose a competent Egyptian with international experience who enjoys the confidence of the national pr=vate sector. If 
you remain unconvinced of the possibility of bankruptcy, t=en you must face the facts: Egyptian GDP per capita is less 
than U.S. $2,0=0 per annum and the average Egyptian household's expenditure on foodstuffs represents more than 50% 
of its an=ual income, despite government subsidies of bread, cooking oil and fuel.q=ont> 
According to a study by re=earcher Dalibor Rohm`, of the Washington-based Cato Institute entitl=d "Towards a reform of 
Egypt's commodity subsidies," a third of Egyptian public spending goes on subsidizing foodstuff and othe= goods, while 
around 80% of the Egyptian population depends on government =inancial assistance. This is the state of affairs created 
by the 1952 revo=ution, which turned Egypt into a consumption-based economy, establishing a black market which, for 
decade=, specialized in pillaging this financial assistance. Rohat's stu=y shows that only a quarter of this assistance finds 
its way to Egypt's =oor, with the rest benefitting the middle and upper income brackets. 
Reforming government suppo=t 
It is true that some of th= ruling Freedom and Justice Party members have spoken on a number of occas=ons about their 
intentions to reform the system of government support, suggesting a number of mechanisms that faile= to achieve 
much. However, the IMF loan conditions are based mainly on the=gradual reduction of fuel subsidies, which is a pledge 
that Qandil's gov=rnment has failed to fulfil, fearing the response of the street which is still in a "revolutionary" 
mindset=
