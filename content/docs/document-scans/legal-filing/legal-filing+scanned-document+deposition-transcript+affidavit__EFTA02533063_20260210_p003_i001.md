Kate Waddington is equally adamant that she will not =iscuss what is clearly a distressing situation for her on a personal 
level=and a financial one. She has had a ringside seat for most of the turbulent=events in Sarah's life, from her 
separation and her affairs to the=rollercoaster of her financial crises. She was at first on Fergie'= private staff before 
leaving to set up her own PR company, Soho-based Spu=nik Communications, in 1998 which then represented Sarah as a 
client. =A0 
And in recent times she also took on the Duchess =80 s socially energetic daughters, Princess Beatrice, 22, and 20-year-
ol= Princess Eugenie. We understand Ms Waddington is owed upwards of £70=000. If she accepted the offer from 
Fergie's advisers, she would r=ceive a mere £18,000. 
All the same, Miss Waddington does not consider her d=spute is with the Duchess, who is her daughter Flora's 
godmother. =ccording to a Buckingham Palace source intimately involved in the negotiat=ons, her fury is directed at 
Prince Andrew. 
This source says Ms Waddington has made it plain she =eels Andrew has not recognised all the work she has done for his 
two daugh=ers. 
For several years, Sputnik employed someone virtually=full-time on the Duchess's account, when much of the work 
involved=the princesses, whose activities required constant organising and public r=lations guidance. 
'Nine times out of ten, Andrew's offi=e would ask Kate's firm to handle things,' says the Palace=insider. 
Meanwhile, Fergie's advisers are trying to br=ng the overall debt down by scrutinising and challenging some bills from 
c=rtain creditors. 
But these are relatively small fry. 'Without =artmoor, she would not have been in this situation; says one advi=er. 
For Prince Andrew, who drily describes himself as a m=n 'with three children' to look after, this is a tense per=od. He put 
his hand into his own pocket to help the woman from whom he has=been divorced for 14 years after ten years of 
marriage, because he knew hi= daughters expected him to help out their mother. 
'Beatrice and Eugenie would have been very up=et if he hadn't helped out their mother - and so would the Queen,=E2 
says a courtier. 
'It is still a source of some concern, and a =istraction for the girls who are both at university. The general feeling i= that 
the sooner this mess is cleared up, the better for everyone. =99 
Andrew's contribution helped pay off her doze= 'personal staff' who were made redundant in the spring wh=n Fergie's 
finances finally spiralled out of control. 
The way they were: Prince Andrew and Fergie together at Upton House in 1992=to see their daughter Beatrice, four, in a 
nativity play Fergie can no longer employ her own staff - but, as ever, friends continue =o ride to her rescue. One is John 
Caudwell, the mobile phone tycoon and on= of Britain's richest men. His daughter Libby has, we understand, =een 
helping the Duchess with her charities. 
Also still on the scene is Geir Frantzen, the Norwegi=n frozen food magnate who gave Fergie the £160,000 Bentley she 
can st=lI be seen being driven in. He is understood to have offered her a bolthol= for Christmas. 
Fergie is dreaming now that her Oprah series will ope= doors to a new television career. And she is still hoping her Little 
Red =hildren's book about a red-headed girl will be made into a series =f money-spinning cartoons.
