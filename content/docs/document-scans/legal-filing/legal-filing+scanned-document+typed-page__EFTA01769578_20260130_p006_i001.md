nuclear explosive device." In other words, Khamenei =ill win his race for a nuclear weapon unless something dramatic 
intervenes=to stop him. 
The best that can b= hoped from another round of negotiations with Tehran is that Khamenei is =ooked into a process 
that enfeebles him. The cleric has consistently avoid=d any meaningful embrace of the negotiating process because he 
sees it as dangerous, a slippery slope where the Americ=ns and Europeans dictate limitations on his nuclear program. 
Many American=critics of negotiations have seen this process as the reverse, a slippery =lope that has Western 
diplomacy enabling the Islamic Republic's nuclear ambitions. Khamenei may have the=stronger argument. But he shows 
no sign of yielding to pressure. 
There is certainly = risk that continuing these negotiations puts Israeli prime minister Bibi =etanyahu and defense 
minister Ehud Barak into a real pickle, since it's =ore difficult for the Israelis to make the case for bombing Iran's nuclear 
sites while the negotiations are goi=g on. Nonetheless, the Israelis need to decide whether a preventive attack=on the 
Islamic Republic can work. Their internal deliberations should not re constrained by a false promise of a diplomatic 
solution. Moving forward with negotiations now is actually=more likely to free the Israelis to act in the summer, if they 
choose to, =han to entrap them. 
Americans, too, nee= to have an honest debate about whether they are willing to permit Khamene= and the 
Revolutionary Guards—the principal state sponsors of terrorism =n the Middle East, whom the Obama administration 
has increasingly nailed for their operational relationship with al Qaeda=97to develop atomic weapons. It would be 
healthy for Democrats and Re=ublicans to debate the Iranian conundrum, which is not going to happen as =ong as 
sanctions-backed diplomacy seems viable. We are fortunate that the nuclear timeline overlaps well with the =012 
presidential campaign: It's the ideal moment for a ripping discussio= about probably the most momentous foreign-policy 
question before us. 
The above five requ=rements—nearly identical to the reported minimum requirements of the Whi=e House—ought to 
clarify where we are on May 23. These conditions w=II be extremely difficult for Khamenei to accept because they are so 
humbling. Shuttering the Fordow facility, which Iran=92s state-controlled press has reported on with pride, would be 
gut-wrench=ng for the supreme leader. It's likely that Khamenei wants to build more=Fordow-like facilities—bomb-
resistant sites that signal spiritual resistance to the West. President Mahmoud Ahma=inejad's boast that Iran intends to 
open 10 more enrichment facilities n= doubt was hyperbolic, but the sentiments clearly reflect Khamenei's dis=osition. 
Closing Fordow would offend the supreme leader's identity as the anti-American Islamic paladin. = 
Even more galling a=d dangerous, U.N. inspectors under this agreement would have the right to =an out across the 
country hunting for suspicious nuclear activity. The IAE='s Additional Protocols, to which Khamenei would have to 
assent, are intrusive and would allow inspectors access to Iranian military and Revolutionary Guard bases. No doubt, the 
supreme leader=and his guards could still cheat (they have lied about the nuclear program=from the beginning). Iran is a 
big country. Satellites and other technical means of observation can only =o so much. The regime is surely working 
clandestinely to perfect more adva=ced centrifuges that could be hidden in smaller buildings and underground =acilities. 
Nevertheless, the o=ds are decent that these inspectors would catch the regime in its big lie =bout the "peaceful" intent 
of the program. Nuclear experts have some i=ea where the Iranians have been militarizing their nuclear "research." Even 
so, an astonishing number of intelligen= people in America and Europe appear to believe that Khamenei's fatwa ab=ut 
the "sinfulness" of nuclear weapons is significant, that it isn't=just ketman, deception deployed against a stronger 
enemy. Exposing Khamenei's flagrant mendacity, for both Iranians and for=igners, is not without value and would again 
refocus the discussion on the=real question: Is it acceptable for Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards =o have nuclear 
weapons? 
But what if the Ira=ians accept all of the demands? Could we still be staring at an Iranian nu=e, just delivered at a slower 
pace? It's possible. If Ali Akbar Hashemi =afsanjani, the former major-domo of Iranian clerical politics and the true father 
of the Islamic Republic's nuclear-=eapons program, were still in charge, we'd likely be enmeshed in the rop=-a-dope 
tactics that he successfully used against the trade-happy European= in the 1990s. Rafsanjani has always advocated the
