For understandable reasons the recto= has had difficulty since 2008 with the notion of collective responsibilit= for 
conduct before the banking crisis. There is a palpable impatience at all levels of the industry with continue= public 
antagonism and criticism. Yet the political and public desire for =ccountability is instinctive and strong, and is being 
actively reinforced =y competing electoral trends and strategies. This is of course why the subject of pay is so 
combustible. 
Sectoral leaders who are not sensiti=e to this, or who try to suggest that problems are isolated to a few uneth=cal 
individuals or failed institutions, are likely to trip up, not least because the steady flow of the Tyrie Comm=ssion's work 
and LIBOR-related sanctions and prosecutions will send the =pposite signal. It will fall in part to CityU= to bring home 
this reality to its members and to lead with a strategy tha= balances a clear defence of the sector's value with a realistic 
underst=nding of just how far its credibility has been damaged. This is a difficult path to tread. 
Nonetheless, if CityUK does not navi=ate this course and insist on the positive value of the sector to the UK e=onomy, 
few others will. One of the problems is finding articulate and courageous exponents from amongst banking's lead=rs 
who are prepared to speak up in a balanced and persuasive way. The trad=tional trade association approach of pointing 
to jobs created and taxes pa=d risks looking irrelevant if it does not register a debate that is shifting onto the ground of 
culture and=ethics. The questions put implicitly to the sector will increasingly focus=on what these jobs involve, how 
their profits are made and in what spirit the taxes are paid.<=o:p> 
One of the temptations of banks is l=kely to be to throw money at high profile CSR work, which risks being sing=larly 
counterproductive in dealing with a critique of their business models. For managers accustomed to being meas=red by 
returns on equity, these more qualitative benchmarks may be difficu=t. It seems to us that part of C=tyUK's work is in 
challenging the way its members approach this changed =andscape. 
One of the marked tendencies of City=K's membership has always been to try to outsource the sector's image =o the 
organisation. Although visible CityUK leaders are vital, CityUK should chiefly be a facilitator for bringing sta=eholders and 
City practitioners together and encouraging a common cause to=emerge. Indeed, one of CityUK's key roles should be 
identifying and cult=vating a new generation of sectoral leaders comfortable and credible on this ground and 
encouraging them as sp=kespeople for the sector. The sector's past narrative became all togethe= too self-satisfied. It 
should start with a sense of humility, acknowledgi=g its massive responsibility for economic growth and stewardship of 
our assets and savings. These things ar= genuine and durable comparative advantages but only with the highest ethi=al 
standards and quality of governance. 
Aside from thesequestions of culture=change, it seems to us that the European issues loom very large for Britai=. 
Financial regulation has already been moved to the European level, with bodies like the PRA and the FCA largely 
=upervising the application of European rules. The coming year will see the=outlines of a banking union negotiated for 
the Eurozone. If the UK is to r=main outside this union then it needs to do so with a clear understanding of the 
consequences. The City'= often aggressive posture on regulation 'from Brussels' has sometimes =eemed 
indistinguishable from euroscepticism and has often been interpreted=as such by politicians and by Brussels. In reality 
the City's interests in a single market for financial service= in which Britian exercises genuine influence are much more 
complex than t=is and have not been well communicated to politicians. This needs to be a =riority. 
Finally, as you noted, we have to be=pragmatic about the diversity of interests represented by CityUK. The insu=ance 
and fund management industries rightly resent the fact that they are often bracketed with the banks. Moreover, th= 
'independent' global banks resent being bracketed with the banks that req=ired direct support from the UK taxpayer. 
Even, the investment banking div=sions of global banks resent the image created by the supposed values of their 
institutional trading floors= Speaking for this group of sub-sectors is not easy, especially as members=are instinctively 
distrustful of each other and competitive as a matter of=course. 
It is not realistic to expect the in=urance or accounting industries to sign up to a narrative of culture chang= to the same 
degree as the banks, but this should not become an argument for trying to circumvent the tough ques=ions concerning
