With the proper standards in mind, it becomes evident that the district court did not abuse 
its discretion in finding that Plaintiffs failed to establish commonality. 
"In this case, proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with [Plaintiffs'] merits contention 
that [Nucor] engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination." Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 
2552. Plaintiffs must establish a unifying policy of discrimination at certification, or "it will 
be impossible to say that examination of all the class members' claims for relief will 
produce a common answer to the crucial question [of] why was I disfavored." Id. In other 
words, Plaintiffs cannot simply identify a group of people who they allege have suffered 
some type of Title VII injury. Id. To certify the class, Plaintiffs must be able to trace that 
injury to a single, common source. Id.; accord Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 
970, 981 (9th Cir. 2011); see also William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 
3:19 (5th ed. 2014) (citing Brown I as an example of a case that approached commonality 
"loosely" and explaining that Wal-Mart articulated "a more explicit definition of 
commonality"). Plaintiffs here must identify [""96] a common policy with common injury to 
members of a class spanning more than a decade, covering Nucor's entire South Carolina 
production facility, and touching upon dozens of relevant decisionmakers. That task can be 
decidedly difficult, especially given that Plaintiffs premise their [' 934] class in part on a 
disparate treatment theory. See Stastny v. S. Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 628 F.2d 267, 274 n.10 
(4th Cir. 1980); see also Garcia v. Johanns, 444 F.3d 625, 633, 370 U.S. App. D.C. 280 
(D.C. Cir. 2006) ("Establishing commonality for a disparate treatment class is particularly 
difficult where, as here, multiple decisionmakers with significant local autonomy exist."). 
A plaintiff who brings a class-wide charge of discrimination must traverse a "wide gap" 
between his claim of individual mistreatment and a class-wide harm. Falcon, 457 U.S. at 
157. The plaintiff could do so in one of two ways. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2553. First, 
he might identify a "biased testing procedure" that is used to evaluate applicants and 
employees. Id. By all accounts, Plaintiffs do not identify that sort of procedure here. 
Second, a plaintiff might offer "significant proof" that an employer "operated under a 
general policy of discrimination . . . [that] manifested itself in hiring and promotion practices 
in the same general fashion." Id. This second route forms the focus of this case. 
Plaintiffs offer two types of ["" 97] evidence that they say bridge the gap between individual 
and class-wide claims: statistical evidence and anecdotal evidence. Whether examining 
these two categories of evidence separately or together, the district court did not abuse its 
discretion in deeming the Plaintiffs' case insufficient. 
A. Statistical Evidence 
1. 
Plaintiffs first present a statistical study comparing a hypothesized, weighted benchmark of 
black bidders for promotions to the number of black employees that they assumed Nucor 
promoted during the relevant period. This evidence performs a double duty, as it goes to 
Plaintiffs' disparate impact claim and their disparate treatment claim. 
As to the disparate impact claim, this sort of statistical evidence should identify disparities 
that are "sufficiently substantial" to raise "an inference of causation." Anderson v. 
Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 406 F.3d 248, 281 (4th Cir. 2005). Without
