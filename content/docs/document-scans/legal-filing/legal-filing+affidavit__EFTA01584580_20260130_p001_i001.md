Overview of Cost Basis 
Cost basis is a tax concept that allows the IRS to determine the capital gain or loss of an asset when it is 
sold. The cost basis of a security is generally the price at which you purchased it. If you purchase shares of 
the same security on different dates, you have different "lots" of that security, and each lot normally 
retains its own discrete cost basis. However, for some securities, the IRS will allow for the cost basis of the 
different lots to be averaged so that each lot will have the same cost basis. You may choose to apply this 
means of determining cost basis (average cost method) to the assets designated by the IRS, by written 
instruction to us via the form provided. 
When selling a portion of the security, for tax purposes, a disposition (sales) methodology (for example, FIFO 
or High Cost) must be used to determine which lots will be sold so that the capital gain or loss can be 
determined. You may choose which disposition methodology to use by written instruction to us via the form 
provided. However, the IRS requires the FIFO disposition methodology be applied to any securities for which 
you have selected the average cost method of figuring cost basis, so any disposition methodology you choose 
(other than FIFO) will not apply to securities for which you have selected the average cost method. 
Implementation of Cost Basis Changes for Securities 
Federal income tax legislation impacting the reporting requirements for sales of stock became effective 
January 1, 2011. As a result, for clients with Form 1099-B tax reporting, J.P. Morgan is required to maintain 
cost basis and calculate and report gain/loss information on sales of stock to the IRS. 
The cost basis legislation introduced the concept of "covered" and "non-covered" securities. A security is 
considered covered if it was acquired after the IRS effective date for that type of investment, as explained 
above. Acquisitions before the effective date are considered non-covered. 
Previously, only the gross proceeds from the sale of a security were reported to the IRS on Form 1099-8. 
Beginning with the 2011 tax year, for sales of covered stock, in addition to gross proceeds, J.P. Morgan must 
report the cost basis and holding period on IRS Form 1099-B. The additional cost basis information will not be 
included on sales of non-covered securities. 
If you have any questions or require further information about the reporting changes on Form 1099-B, please 
contact a member of your J.P. Morgan team. Thank you for your trust and confidence in J.P. Morgan.
