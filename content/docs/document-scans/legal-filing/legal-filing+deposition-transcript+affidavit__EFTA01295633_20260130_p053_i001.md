317-18; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6). "The clear error standard . . . protects ("86] 
district courts' primacy as triers of fact." Evans, 514 F.3d at 321. Our opinions have 
repeatedly emphasized that clear-error review is "narrow," Walker v. Kelly, 593 F.3d 319, 
323 (4th Cir. 2010), "highly deferential," Green v. Johnson, 515 F.3d 290, 301 (4th Cir. 
2008), and "particularly circumscribed," Jiminez v. Mary Washington College, 57 F.3d 369, 
378 (4th Cir. 1995). We may reverse findings reviewed under this standard only when, 
having reviewed the entire record, we are "left with the definite and firm conviction that a 
mistake has been committed." United States v. Heyer, 740 F.3d 284, 292 (4th Cir. 2014). If 
the district court those between "two permissible views of the evidence," or if it otherwise 
offered a "plausible" account of that evidence, Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 
470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1985), then its factual findings are 
"conclusive," Walker, 593 F.3d at 323. And as with the abuse-of-discretion standard, we 
cannot reverse ('930] merely because we would have decided the matter differently. See 
Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573.

Despite these deferential standards of review, the majority identifies reversible error in 
virtually every legal and factual judgment that the district court rendered. Yet in searching 
the majority's opinion for any of the hallmarks of deference -- explanations as to how the 
district court clearly erred, or full analysis of how the district court abused its discretion --
we find very little. 
In truth, the majority seems to apply just about every standard of review but a deferential 
one. For the most r87] part, the majority offers bare statements that the district court 
erred, apparently because the district court decided things differently than the majority 
would have. For instance, it insists that Plaintiffs' statistical evidence is simply "less 
precise" and rejects out-of-hand the district court's view that the evidence was 
"fundamentally unreliable." Maj. op. at 18, 23. Likewise, it draws its own conclusions about 
the anecdotal evidence, reciting certain portions of certain affidavits and declaring them 
enough. It makes credibility determinations, categorically rejecting Nucor's evidence as 
"self-serving," id. at 25, or "coercive," id. at 42, while embracing contrary statements from 
Plaintiffs because the majority finds them "credible," id. at 41. And it offers its own notions 
about what is "plain," id. at 29, "elementary," id. at 39, or "common sense," id. at 42. The 
majority does so even while decrying the dangers of "cherry pick[ing] facts from an 11,000 
page record." Id. at 41. In short, the majority opinion shows little respect for a district court 
that is far more familiar with each page of the record than we are. 
Contravening our "axiomatic" rule against factual findings on appeal, Core Communs., Inc. 
v. Verizon Maryland LLC, 744 F.3d 310, 324 (4th Cir. 2014), the majority eventually finds 
in the first ("88] instance that "there is only one answer to the question of why Nucor's 
black workers were consistently disfavored," maj. op. at 45. This adventuresome approach 
is rather jarring when placed against the more measured methods found in some of our 
other class certification decisions. See, e.g., EQT Prod., 764 F.3d at 371 (remanding for 
further consideration of class certification after determining that district court misapplied 
the relevant standards); Gariety v. Grant Thornton, LLP, 368 F.3d 356, 366 (4th Cir. 2004) 
(same). Making matters worse, the majority offers no good reason for it. Instead, it
