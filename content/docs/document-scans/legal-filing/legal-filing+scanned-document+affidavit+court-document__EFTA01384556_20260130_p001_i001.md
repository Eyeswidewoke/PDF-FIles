Convertible Arbitrage Strategies 
The success of the Capital Structure Fund's convertible arbitrage strategy depends upon 
Hudson Bay Capital's ability to identify convertible securities that appear incorrectly 
valued relative to their theoretical value, purchase (or sell short) such a convertible 
security and sell short (or purchase) the underlying security for which the convertible 
security can be exchanged to exploit price differentials. There can be no assurance that 
Hudson Bay Capital will be able to identify convertible arbitrage opportunities or that 
changes in price differentials will not cause losses. Borrowing and lending against such 
investments involves substantial risks. The prices of these investments can be volatile, 
market movements are difficult to predict, and financing sources and related interest and 
exchange rates are subject to rapid change. Certain corporate securities may be 
subordinated (and thus exposed to the first level of default risk) or otherwise subject to 
substantial credit risks. 
Risks that can affect the results of convertible arbitrage include, but are not limited to, the 
following: (i) in positions where the credit exposure is not hedged, deterioration in the 
perceived credit-worthiness of an issuer will likely result in losses; (ii) the valuation 
process involves the estimation of various variables, such as the volatility of the 
underlying stock and the issuer's dividend policy, which may realize substantially 
different values from Hudson Bay Capital's estimates; (iii) even if all inputs are 
estimated correctly, a convertible may take years to converge to theoretical value, and in 
the meantime may diverge further, causing losses; (iv) the market for convertibles is 
generally less liquid, with higher bid-ask spreads, than the market for equities, a 
phenomenon which is particularly exacerbated during times of stress; (v) the strategy is 
subject to all the risks involved in selling equities short, including the risk of increasing 
borrowing costs or buy-ins, either of which can cause substantial losses; and (vi) 
corporate actions, such as mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, and special dividends, can 
have a significant effect on the returns of a given position, both positive and negative. 
Market Neutral and Hedged Strategies 
Although Hudson Bay Capital may invest in positions that are intended to be market 
neutral, it may be unable to, or decide not to, hedge its positions, and, in such event, the 
Capital Structure Fund might sustain a significant risk of loss as a result of changes in the 
price of unhedged positions. In addition, there is no guarantee that the returns of the 
Capital Structure Fund will continue to have a low correlation or be non-correlated with 
market indices, and the Capital Structure Fund could experience significant losses. 
The Capital Structure Fund also may utilize financial instruments such as commodity 
interests, forward contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and floors both for investment 
purposes and to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of the Capital 
Structure Fund's portfolio positions. Hedging against a decline in the value of a 
portfolio position does not eliminate fluctuations in the values of portfolio positions or 
prevent losses if the values of such positions decline, but establishes other positions 
designed to gain from those same developments, thus moderating the decline in the 
portfolio positions' value. Such hedge transactions also limit the opportunity for gain if
