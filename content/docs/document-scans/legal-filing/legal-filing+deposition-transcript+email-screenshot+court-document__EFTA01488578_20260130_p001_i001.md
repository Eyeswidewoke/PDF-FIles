the value of which may have been provided to us by third parties who may not be independent of the issuer or manager. Such information is reflected as of the last date provided to us. and is not

reliable and is furnished for the exclusive use of the client.

transactions could be entered into, or the actual terms on which existing transactions or securities could be liquidated. 
The current price is the value of the financial asset share, unit or contract as priced at the close of the market on the last day of the statement period or the last available price. 
All values provided for structured yield deposits (for example. JPMorgan London Time Deposits) reflect the original deposit amount only.

Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are indicative values as of the 
close of business of the date of this statement and, except as otherwise agreed in writing, these valuations do not represent the actual terms at which transactions or securities could be bought or sold or 
new transactions could be entered into, or the actual terms on which existing transactions or securities could be liquidated as of the date of this statement. We do not warrant their completeness or 
accuracy. These valuations are derived from proprietary models based upon well-recognized financial principles and we have. when necessary to calculate the present value of future cash flows. made 
reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions. Valuations based on other models or different assumptions may yield different results. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility 
for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put.

Important Information Regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily, 
weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In a 
failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements. Accordingly, investors should not rely on pricing 
information appearing in their statements with respect to ARS.
