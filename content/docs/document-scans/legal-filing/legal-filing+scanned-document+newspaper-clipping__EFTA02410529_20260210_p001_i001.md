Dubai banks given extra liquidity 
The central bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has said it is setting up a facility to 
provide banks with extra liquidity. 
The news comes days after the state-owned Dubai World said it would ask for an extension on 
repaying its debts, sending world stock markets tumbling. 
The liquidity will be available to all UAE banks as well as foreign banks operating in the UAE. 
Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi says it will "pick and choose" how to assist Dubai. 
"We will look at Dubai's commitments and approach them on a case-by-case basis," an Abu 
Dhabi government official said on Saturday. 
"It does not mean that Abu Dhabi will underwrite all of their debts," he added. 
The announcement from the central bank came the day before markets in the Middle East reopen 
after the Eid holiday. 
"[The] central bank has issued a notice to UAE banks and branches of foreign banks operating in 
the UAE, making available to them a special additional liquidity facility linked to their current 
accounts at the central bank," it said in a statement. 
The bank added that the banking system in the UAE was more sound and liquid than a year ago.

Bloomberg 
Banks will be able to use a special facility tied to their current accounts that can be accessed at a 
cost of 50 basis points above the three-month local benchmark interest rate, the Abu Dhabi-based 
regulator said in an e-mailed statement today. There are 100 basis points in a percentage point. 
"This is very a reassuring move by the central bank to limit the risk of any run on Dubai-based 
banks," said John Sfakianakis, chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi in Riyadh. It will alleviate 
any "liquidity concerns by foreign banks about the banking system, mostly those based in Dubai." 
Dubai World, a state-owned holding company struggling with $59 billion of debt and other 
liabilities, said Nov. 25 it would seek a standstill agreement with creditors and an extension of loan 
maturities until at least May 30, 2010. The news led to a slump in financial markets around the 
world and raised prospects of rising loan losses for U.A.E. and foreign banks. 
The benchmark three-month Emirates interbank offered rate was at 1.919 percent on Nov. 25, the 
last working day before a religious holiday, according to Bloomberg data. The U.A.E. has 24 local 
banks and 28 units of foreign lenders operating in the country, including those of Citigroup Inc., 
HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc. 
Loan losses 
U.A.E. banks are already facing rising loan losses stemming from the global recession as the 
economy slowed and two Saudi Arabian business groups defaulted on at least $15.7 billion of 
loans. Provisions for bad loans at U.A.E. banks rose to 2.76 percent of the total as of the end of 
October from 1.92 percent a year ago, according to central bank data.
