Lookinct io set the stage into a 2ti aCE:eleiotv>n 
With arguably amongst the largest core positions in what could be the leading 
asset of the next oil cycle, the investment case at PXD largely rests on it ability 
to translate resource potential into leading, capital efficient growth. Despite 
encouraging signs, noisy 1O operations (weather downtime, ethane rejection, 
completion deferrals) prevent a clean look at improving operations. Going 
forward, we look for efficiency gains in a narrowed, focused Permian 
development program as an indicator for future broad asset potential as 
activity accelerates in 2H15. Hold.

Leading the charge? PXD expects to add two horizontal rigs per month in 
the northern SpraberryNVolfcamp beginning in July contingent on 
continued strength in the oil markets and following a sale of its Eagle Ford 
midstream business. We look for timing of potential production impact and 
growth and capital implications for 2016. 
Cost Reductions: Look for detailed updates on the pace of remaining cost 
reductions. Realized D&C cost reductions of 15% vs. 2014 to date, with 
year-end target of 20%+. Lifting costs -8% YoY driving further profitability 
gains. Look for additional clarity on potential/timing of reductions, 
including 15% and 10% in facilities costs and lifting costs respectively. 
Deferring to Save: Expect some discussion on portfolio benefit of its 
decision to defer 25 hz well completions (of 90 planned in I H15) in the 
Permian in order to exclusively utilize Pioneer Pumping Services. The shift 
will reduce 2Q volumes expectations (198-203 Mboe/d vs. Street 207), but 
increase and flatten 2H volumes (-200 Mboe/d). Also look for impact of 
shift on ability to accelerate in 2H15. 
Highgrading and the Production Outlook: Although operational noise on 
the quarter obscured 
underlying operations somewhat (Permian 
production --4 Mboe/d QoQ), impacted by weather (3 Mboe/d), ethane 
rejection (5 Mobe/d), production of 194 Mboe/d still hit the guidance range 
(192-197) despite materially lower well completions than planned 
(deferrals). Look for read through to efficiency gains, the impact of 
highgraded inventory, and potential of upper Eagle Ford resource.
