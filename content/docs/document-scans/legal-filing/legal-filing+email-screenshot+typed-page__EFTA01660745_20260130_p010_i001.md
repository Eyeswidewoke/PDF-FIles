FBI Task Force Officer Accuses North Texas Man of Flying Drone Over Globe Life 
Field During Game 
WFAA (ABC-8) (07/02, Yanes) reported that an FBI Task Force officer has accused Jason Carvell Banner of 
flying a drone around Globe Life Field while it was under a temporary flight restriction (TFR) during 
a Texas Rangers game. The article stated that according to the criminal complaint, the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) issued a TFR, which temporarily restricts all aircraft from operating within three 
nautical miles of any regular or postseason Major League Baseball game. This is also known as the 
stadium TFR, and it goes into effect one hour before the start of an event and ends one hour after the 
event is over. The article mentioned that the criminal complaint says that on Oct. 19, 2023, Arlington 
police officers responded to parking lot D of the stadium about a small unmanned aircraft -- or a drone --
while the Rangers hosted the Houston Astros. According to the document, Texas Rangers security was 
with the accused operator, Banner. Banner allegedly admitted to police that he was flying the drone that 
evening and let an FBI special agent examine it after this confession, the document states. The complaint 
states that the FBI Task Force officer confirmed the drone had flown in the TFR area and with his 
experience he noted that the drone has a feature that alerts operators if they are in a restricted airspace. 
Due to this knowledge, the Task Force officer believes that Banner knowingly and willfully violated the 
TFR, the complaint states.

Florida Developer Tells Friends: `Allegations Are Entirely False' in FBI Investigation 
The Miami Herald (07/02, Hanks, Weaver) reported that Miami developer Sergio Pino this week told 
friends and professional contacts he's innocent in the FBI's investigation into threats made against his 
wife and said he's been frustrated by not being able to tell his side of the story after the probe became 
public last week. The article noted that the Herald reported that federal investigators are looking into the 
possibility that Pino hired others to menace his estranged wife after she moved out of their Coral Gables 
home and filed for divorce in 2022. Four men have been charged with stalking Tatiana Pino in connection
