The story was accompanied by a photograph of Prince Andrew with his arm around Ms M, 
taken in 2001. Although the newspaper went out of its way to emphasise that there was no 
suggestion that the Queen's second son had engaged in any improper or illegal sexual conduct, 
headlines such as "Prince Andrew and 'naked pool parties' at his paedophile friend's house" had 
the desired effect of portraying a royal duke wallowing in sleaze. 
As is usual in such circumstances, other papers, not wanting to be left behind in the cross-country 
pursuit of hunt the royal fox, have laboured mightily to be the next to draw blood from the prey. 
Thus, The Daily Telegraph — perhaps to the consternation of older readers accustomed to more 
respectful treatment of the House of Windsor — ran the following headline across the fill width 
of last Thursday's front page: "The duke, his paedophile guest, and the most unusual use of an 
RAF base"; it went on to assert: "The Duke of York is facing renewed questions about his 
friendship with Jeffrey Epstein after it emerged that the convicted paedophile landed his private 
jet at an RAF fighter base during a visit [to see the duke] at Sandringham." Cor! 
However, a closer reading of the body of the story yields the fact that the visit occurred back in 
2000, many years before Epstein's trial and conviction; and a Ministry of Defence spokesman 
admitted that civil aircraft are "routinely granted permission" to land at RAF bases. So, not 
exactly "Corr; in fact, barely "Well, I never". 
I do recall thinking the friendship between Epstein and Andrew 
rather surprisingYet the Telegraph's story was a model of understatement compared with 
the Daily Mirror's grotesque effort on the same day: "Prince Andrew was dealt a fresh blow last 
night after it was revealed pervert friend Jeffrey Epstein met his girls as children. Papers show the 
paedophile, jailed for luring a young girl into prostitution, mingled with Princesses Eugenie and 
Beatrice in the Bahamas in 1998. A palace insider said: 'It was a fleeting meeting with Epstein, 
but it is still a great worry.'" That's it; that's the whole story, in full. Read it and weep — with 
laughter at the outrageous contrivance of it all. 
I suppose, before I am outed by the Minor as a paedophile at one remove, I had better confess 
all. In January 1999 we enjoyed a brief family holiday at Epstein's now notorious Florida home. 
My wife had known Epstein since the mid-1980s; when she told him in the winter of 1998 that 
our younger child had been most unwell for a long period, he said that what she needed was some 
sunshine and insisted we stay at his Palm Beach home. 
The place was empty, apart from us and the housekeeper; but, yes, I did notice a photograph in it 
of Epstein and his then girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell with Prince Andrew. This, of course, was 
before Andrew took on the job of being Britain's "special trade representative" — and long before 
the world knew of Epstein's involvement with teenage girls (not the same thing as "paedophilia", 
by the way, since none of the girls was pre-pubescent, but undeniably both sordid and 
exploitative).
