DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED SECURITIES 
The trust will be governed by the terms of a restated trust agreement. Under the restated trust agreement, the 
trust may issue, from time to time, only one series of preferred securities. The preferred securities will have the 
terms set forth in the restated trust agreement or made a part of the restated trust agreement by the Trust 
Indenture Act, and described in the related prospectus supplement. These terms will mirror the terms of the 
subordinated debt securities purchased by the trust using the proceeds from the sale of its preferred securities and 
its common securities. The subordinated debt securities issued to the trust will be guaranteed by us on a 
subordinated basis and are referred to as the "corresponding subordinated debt securities" relating to the trust. 
See "Use of Proceeds." 
The following summary sets forth the material terms and provisions of the restated trust agreement and the 
preferred securities to which any prospectus supplement relates. You should refer to the form of restated trust 
agreement and to the Trust Indenture Act for complete information regarding the terms and provisions of that 
agreement and of the preferred securities, including the definitions of some of the terms used below. The form of 
restated trust agreement filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part is 
incorporated by reference in this summary. Whenever particular sections or defined terms of a restated trust 
agreement are referred to, such sections or defined terms are incorporated herein by reference, and the statement 
in connection with which such reference is made is qualified in its entirety by such reference. 
Issuance, Status and Guarantee of Preferred Securities 
Under the terms of the restated trust agreement for the trust, the administrative trustees will issue the 
preferred securities on behalf of the trust. The preferred securities will represent preferred beneficial interests in 
the trust and the holders of the preferred securities will be entitled to a preference in certain circumstances as 
regards distributions and amounts payable on redemption or liquidation over the common securities of the trust, 
as well as other benefits under the corresponding restated trust agreement. The preferred securities of the trust 
will rank equally, and payments will be made on the preferred securities pro rata, with the common securities of 
the trust except as described under "— Subordination of Common Securities." The property trustee will hold 
legal title to the corresponding subordinated debt securities in trust for the benefit of the holders of the related 
preferred securities and common securities. The common securities and the preferred securities of the trust are 
collectively referred to as the "trust securities" of the trust. 
We will issue a guarantee agreement for the benefit of the holders of the trust's preferred securities. Under 
such preferred securities guarantee. we will guarantee on a subordinated basis payment of distributions on the 
related preferred securities and amounts payable on redemption or liquidation of such preferred securities. but 
only to the extent that the related trust has funds on hand to make such payments. See "Description of Preferred 
Securities Guarantee." 
Distributions 
Distributions on the preferred securities will be cumulative, will accumulate from the original issue date and 
will be payable on the dates as specified in the related prospectus supplement. In the event that any date on which 
distributions are payable on the preferred securities is not a Business Day, payment of the distribution payable on 
such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day. and without any additional 
distributions or other payment in respect of any such delay, except that, if such Business Day is in the next 
succeeding calendar year, payment of such distribution shall be made on the immediately preceding Business 
Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was originally payable. 
(Section 4.1) A "Business Day" is any day other than a Saturday or a Sunday, or a day on which banking 
institutions in the City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or a 
day on which the principal corporate trust office of the property trustee or the trustee for the corresponding 
subordinated debt securities is closed for business. (Section 1.1)
