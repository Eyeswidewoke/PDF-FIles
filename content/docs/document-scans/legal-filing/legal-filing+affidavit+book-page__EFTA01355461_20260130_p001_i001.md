be no assurance as to whether any such regulatory scrutiny or initiatives will have an adverse impact on the private 
investment industry, including the ability of the Fund to achieve its objectives. It is impossible to predict what, if any, 
changes may be instituted with respect to the regulations applicable to the Fund, the Manager, the U.S. Adviser, the 
General Partner, the Second GP and their respective affiliates, the markets in which they operate and invest or the 
couMerparties with which they do business, or what effect such legislation or regulations might have. There can be no 
assurance that the Fund, the Manager, the U.S. Adviser, the General Partner, the Second GP and their respective 
affiliates will be able, for financial reasons or otherwise, to comply with future laws and regulations, and any regulations 
which restrict the ability of the Fund to implement its investment strategy. 
Brexit 
The UK has formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the European Union ('Brexit"). Under the 
process for leaving the European Union contemplated in article 50 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European 
Union, the UK will remain a member state until a withdrawal agreement is entered into. or failing that, two years following 
the notification of the intention to leave. The terms and precise timetable of withdrawal are unknown at this time. 
Furthermore, as a result of Brexit. other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their 
continuing membership with the European Union. Given these possibilities and others that are not anticipated, at this 
time, it is difficult to predict how the UK withdrawal from the European Union will be implemented and what the economic, 
tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory and other implications will be for the asset management industry, the broader European and 
global financial markets generally and for private funds such as the Fund and the Fund's investments. This uncertainty is 
likely to continue to impact the global economic climate and may impact opportunities, pricing, availability and cost of 
bank financing, regulation, values or exit opportunities of companies or assets based, doing business, or having service 
or other significant relationships in, the UK or the European Union, including companies or assets held or considered for 
prospective investment by the Fund. 
The future application of European Union-based legislation to the private fund industry in the UK and the European 
Union will ultimately depend on how the UK renegotiates its relationship with the European Union. There can be no 
assurance that any renegotiated terms or regulations will not have an adverse impact on the Fund and its investments, 
including the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objectives. Brexit may result in significant market dislocation. 
heightened counterparty risk, an adverse effect on the management of market risk and, in particular, asset and liability 
management due in pan to redenomination of financial assets and liabilities, and increased legal, regulatory or 
compliance burden for Investors, the Manager and/or the Fund, each of which may have a negative impact on the 
operations, financial condition, returns or prospects of the Fund. 
Brexit may also have an adverse effect on the tax treatment of the Fund and its investments. In particular, the European 
Union directives preventing withholding taxes being imposed on intra-group dividends, interest and royalties may no 
longer apply to payments made into and out of the UK. meaning that instead the UK's double tax treaty network would 
need to be relied upon. Further, there may be changes to the operation of VAT. 
While the most immediate impacts on corporate transactions will likely be related to changes in market conditions. the 
development of new regulatory regimes and parallel competition law enforcement may have an adverse impact on 
transactions. particularly those occurring in, or impacted by conditions in, the UK and Europe. 
Anti-money laundering compliance 
The General Partner, the Second GP or the Manager may be required by law, regulation or government authority or 
where it is in the best interests of the Fund, in each case as a whole, to disclose information in respect of the identity of 
Investors. In addition, the General Partner, the Second GP or the Manager may be required by law, regulation or 
government authority to disclose certain information about the Fund and its arrangements with Investors, including 
disclosing the existence of, disclosing copies of, and reporting certain information about, any side letters or other 
arrangements that the Fund enters into with Investors that allow Investors to invest in the Fund under terms that vary 
from those applicable to other Investors. 
The General Partner, the Second GP or the Manager may be required by law, regulation or government authority to 
suspend the account of an Investor or take other anti•money laundering steps. Where the General Partner, the Second
