incorporation and by-laws also provide that newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the 
authorized number of up to 15 directors, or any vacancy, may be filled by a vote of a majority of directors then in 
office. Accordingly, our board of directors may be able to prevent any stockholder from obtaining majority 
representation on the board of directors by increasing the size of the board and filling the newly created 
directorships with its own nominees. Directors may be removed at any time for cause by the majority vote of the 
directors then in office. Additionally, directors may be removed with or without cause by the vote or consent of 
80% of our stockholders entitled to vote in the election of directors. 
Stockholder Approval of Certain Transactions Effecting a Change of Control 
The affirmative vote or consent of 80% of our stockholders entitled to vote in the election of directors is 
required to authorize any of the following transactions: 
• 
our merger or consolidation into any other corporation or entity: 
• 
the sale, lease, exchange. mortgage or other disposition of all or any substantial part of our assets to 
any other corporation. person or other entity; or 
• 
the sale or lease by any other corporation, person or entity to us or any of our subsidiaries of any 
securities or assets, except assets having an aggregate fair market value of less than $4,000,000, in 
exchange for our or any of our subsidiaries' voting securities, including securities convertible into 
voting securities or options and warrants or rights to purchase voting securities; 
if such corporation, person or entity is, or has been at any time within the preceding two years, the beneficial 
owner of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote in the elections of directors. These 
transactions do not require an 80% stockholder vote if (a) our board of directors approved a memorandum of 
understanding with the other corporation prior to the time the other corporation became a beneficial owner of 5% 
or more of the outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote in the elections of directors or (b) a majority of the 
outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote in elections of directors of the target corporation is 
owned by us.

special meeting of stockholders as has been specified in our notice to stockholders of such meeting, which notice
