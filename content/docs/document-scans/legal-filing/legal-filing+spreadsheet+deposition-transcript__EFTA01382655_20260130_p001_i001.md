Table of Conteak 
Revenue decreases internationally were offset by growth in North American credit cant and retail card processing revenue of $31 
million, along with growth in output services of $24 million, print, plastics and remittance processing businesses. Growth in North America was 
partially offset by disposed businesses, which negatively impacted North America's revenue growth rate by approximately 3% in 2013. 
North America card accounts on file increased in 2013 versus 2012 from net new account conversions and growth from existing clients. 
International card accounts on file increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to new accounts in India and the United Kingdom. 
Global Financial Solutions Segment EBffDA increased significantly in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the impact of the revenue items 
noted above as well as decreased operating expenses as a result of lower headcount and changes in compensation programs. EB1TDA growth was 
partially offset by the impact of a strong U.S. dollar as foreign currency exchange rate movements negatively impacted segment EB1TDA in 2014 
compared to 2013 by 1 percentage point. 
Global Financial Solutions Segment EBffDA increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due mostly to decreased operating expenses resulting 
from our cost reduction initiatives partially offset by declines in revenue noted above.

revenue of $24 million were offset by growth in our portfolio of fraud solutions products. 
EFT Network revenue increased due to internal growth and a new transaction routing program that was introduced in the first quarter of 
2014, which positively impacted growth by $17 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Stored Value Network revenue decreased due to the disposition 
of a noncore transportation payments joint venture. EFS. that occurred in late May 2014 and had an approximate $30 million negative impact on 
segment revenue. The impact of the EPS disposition was partially offset by higher payment volumes within the open loop payroll distribution 
program related to existing clients and new business.
