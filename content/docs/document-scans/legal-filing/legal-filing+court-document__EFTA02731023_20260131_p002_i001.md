substantiate how such payments were calculated or were compensation for services. Your failure 
to substantiate Epstein's compensation scheme has heightened the Committee's concerns about 
whether such payments were properly characterized as income or gifts for tax purposes. 
Background 
As you know, on June 22, 2022, the Committee initiated an investigation into your 
business arrangement with Epstein. As part of the Committee's investigation, the Committee sent 
a letter to Apollo Global Management ("Apollo") with detailed requests for information 
regarding the findings of a review commissioned by Apollo's Board of Directors into your 
financial ties to Epstein.' The Board's review was initiated in response to Epstein's indictment in 
federal court on sex trafficking charges involving the exploitation and abuse of dozens of 
underage girls.2 The findings of the Apollo board's review, compiled in a report prepared by the 
law firm Dechert LLP ("the Dechert report"), were published in a filing by Apollo with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission! 
The Dechert report indicated that you paid Epstein $158 million between 2012 and 2017 
for his advice on several tax and estate planning matters.' These transactions included a 
"proprietary" solution Epstein devised to help you resolve issues with a grantor trust you created 
in 2006 to transfer assets to your children while avoiding approximately $1 billion in gift and 
estate taxes.' The Dechert report also claimed that Epstein assisted you with a "step-up-basis 
transaction" ("the step-up-basis transaction") designed to save you an additional $600 million in 
taxes.`
The Committee's initial letter, a copy of which is attached, asked detailed questions on 
the nature of Epstein's tax and estate planning services as well as details regarding payments to

Id. at pg. 3: "Epstein regularly advised [Leon] Black on a variety of issues related to trust and estate planning, tax, 
philanthropy, and the operation of the Family Office" and at pg. 4: "[Leon] Black compensated Epstein for his work 
in amounts that were intended to be proportional to the value provided by Epstein. Those payments for work 
performed over the period 2012 through 2017 totaled $158 million." 
51d. at pg. 9: "There was a consensus among witnesses that Epstein offered a unique solution to a potential estate 
planning problem that arose out of a trust known as the 2006 Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (2006 GRAT)" and at 
pg. 10: "Witnesses differed on what the value of the estate tax would have been today or in the future if the issues 
had not been resolved, but they believed the estate tax liability could have been as much as $1 billion or more... 
Epstein approached Black with his solution — which Epstein asserted was proprietary — and Black agreed to pay 
Epstein to implement this solution. Outside legal counsel described the solution as a "grand slam" and one that met 
all of Black's financial and estate planning goals." 
'Id. at pg. 10: "Epstein appears to have provided significant value to a subsequent transaction that addressed certain 
loans between [Leon] Black and certain family trusts for the purpose of achieving a tax benefit for his children" and 
at pg. 11: "Epstein estimated that this transaction had saved 5600 million in value and Black appears to have agreed 
with that estimate."
