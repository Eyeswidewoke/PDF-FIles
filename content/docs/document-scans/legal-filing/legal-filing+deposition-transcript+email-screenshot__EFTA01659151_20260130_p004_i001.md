LEADING THE NEWS 
Georgia Recertifies Election Results As Trump Legal Efforts Continue Elsewhere. 
Norah O'Donnell said on the CBS Evening NewsVi (12/7, story 5, 1:45, 4.74M) that with "more 
states certifying their results, there are questions tonight about the future of the President's 
legal fight to overturn the election." In Georgia, CBS' Paula Reid reported, Secretary of State 
Brad Raffensperger, "a Republican, recertified the results [Monday] after a second recount." 
Raffensperger: "We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain 
unchanged." On NBC Nightly NewsVi (12/7, story 5, 1:30, Holt, 6.35M), Hallie Jackson said Joe 
Biden's "win [was] recertified in Georgia after a recount, with a top Republican there dismissing 
the campaign's baseless claims of widespread fraud." 
CNN (12/7, Collins, 83.16M) reports on its website that according to "multiple sources," 
there is "a sense developing within Donald Trump's legal team and what remains of his 
campaign staff that their efforts to overturn or delay the results of the election are coming to 
an end...despite what the President has said publicly. ... Following the news of Rudy Giuliani's 
coronavirus hospitalization, staffers only speculated further that it's a matter of time before 
their legal efforts come to a halt completely." 
The Washington Post (12/7, 14.2M) reports that Raffensperger "said Monday that the 
office would recertify the state's election results, which would reaffirm Biden's victory after a 
second statewide recount of presidential votes." The New York Times (12/7, Roose, 18.61M) 
reports Raffensperger's office "dedicated part of a morning news conference to debunking" 
several "falsehood[s]...in what was called `Disinformation Monday." According to the AP (12/7, 
Brumback), "the total number of votes in the recount results certified Monday and posted on 
the secretary of state's website was 766 fewer than the number certified when the ballots were 
first tallied after the election. Biden's lead dropped from 12,670 to 11,779." 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (12/7, 895K) says the President's "efforts to overturn 
Georgia's election results have met a wall of opposition from an unlikely source: Republican 
state officials and GOP-appointed judges who have loudly rejected his calls to undo Joe Biden's 
narrow victory in the state. ... Trump's pleas to top state officials to interfere in the election 
have been soundly rejected by Republican politicians he once endorsed." 
The Wall Street Journal (12/7, Corse, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), Axios (12/7, 
521K), and The Hill (12/7, Greenwood, 2.98M) also cover the certification, while other outlets 
examine the impact of the fight between Trump and his party's leaders in Georgia on the two 
January 5 Senate runoffs. Steve Osunsami said on ABC World News TonightVi (12/7, story 4, 
2:20, Muir, 7.76M), "The deadline in Georgia to register to vote in this upcoming runoff 
election" was Monday night. At a weekend rally, Trump "was trying to help the two sitting 
Republican senators who hope to hold onto their seats. ... The real worry: that Republicans 
might not show up to vote is born from the President's own made-up stories about widespread 
election fraud in the November election." Politico (12/7, Arkin, 4.29M) reports, "During a 
feverish weekend of campaigning...Georgia Republicans continued to indulge Trump's untruths 
about the last election, while imploring their backers to show up for the next one." 
The AP (12/7) reports that Secretary of State Pompeo "plans to deliver a speech extolling 
the Trump administration's foreign policy this week in Georgia, ahead of key Senate run-off 
elections in the state that will determine control of the upper chamber of Congress." Fox News 
(12/7, Steinhauser, 27.59M) reports on its website that while it is "normal for secretaries of 
state to speak to domestic audiences, the address by Pompeo comes as the nation's campaign 
spotlight is shining on Georgia. ... And it comes as Pompeo, who political pundits consider a
