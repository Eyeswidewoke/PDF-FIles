Players chose whether to contribute $1 into a public pool or keep it in his/her private funds at each round 
for 12 rounds. Without visual contact with the player, an experimenter passed a locked box into each cubicle, in 
which every player placed his/her anonymized envelope (blank on the outside; pseudonym on the inside) containing 
$0 or SI. Contributions were recorded on the public screen under each player's pseudonym. The group total and 
player payout were displayed for each round, as was the aggregate total contribution for each player. 
After round 10. the experimenter opened the envelopes labeled with the pseudonyms of the 2 players who 
donated least overall in the shame treatments to reveal their real names (in the honour treatment it was the 2 players 
who donated most). In the event of a tie, the experimenter chose 2 players by throwing a 6-sided die, with the 
pseudonyms pre-determinedly linked to each number. Ties occurred in 5 of the shame games and 4 of the honour 
games. Interestingly, ties only occurred only for the second least (or most) generous players but never for the least 
(or most) generous players. The 2 least generous players went in front of the group and wrote their name on a board 
under the phrase "I donated least", which was visible for the entire game (for honour, the phrase was "I donated 
most" and the 2 most generous players went in front). The real names of these 2 players were also added to the 
pseudonyms on the public screen. The remaining 4 envelopes with the names of the 4 players that retained their 
anonymity were visibly destroyed and discarded in front of the group. In the control treatment all 6 players remained 
anonymous. At the end of round 12. each player left with the money he/she kept during the game plus the profits 
from the public pool. Note that the profits from the public pool were the same for every player and could therefore 
be distributed without compromising the players' anonymity. The students were asked not to discuss the experiment 
with anyone else.
