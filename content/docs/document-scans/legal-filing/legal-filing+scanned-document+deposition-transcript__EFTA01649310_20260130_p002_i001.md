34 United States Code section 20141 or the VRRA link posted at https://www.notify.usdoj.gov. 
Now that charges have been filed in federal court, victims of the charges filed are, in addition, 
entitled to the following rights, according to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, Title 18 United States 
Code section 3771: (1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused; (2) The right to 
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, 
involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused; (3) The right not to be excluded from 
any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, 
determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other 
testimony at that proceeding; (4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the 
district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding; (5) The reasonable right 
to confer with the attomey for the Government in the case; (6) The right to full and timely restitution 
as provided in law; (7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay; (8) The right to be 
treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy; (9) The right to be informed 
in a timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement; and (10) The right to be 
informed of the rights under this section and the services described in section 503(c) of the Victims' 
Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (34 U.S.C. 20141(c)) and provided contact information for the 
Office of the Victims' Rights Ombudsman of the Department of Justice. If you want to inform the 
prosecutors of your views regarding any aspect of the case, please contact one of the prosecutors 
listed above or me at 917-301-6861. 
Please understand that these rights apply only to victims of the counts charged in federal court, and 
thus you may not be able to exercise all of these rights if the crime of which you are a victim was not 
charged. In any event, we will continue to provide you with notifications and services unless you tell 
us not to. We will make our best efforts to ensure you are provided the rights and services to which 
you are entitled. You may contact the Victim/Witness Coordinator at the office listed above if you 
have questions about the progress of your case, your rights or the services to which you are 
entitled, or how you can assert them during the proceedings.lf you believe that a Justice Department 
employee has not provided you with these rights, you may file a complaint with the Justice 
Department's Victims' Rights Ombudsman. For more information, go to 
http://www.justice.gov/usao/resources/crime-victims-rights-ombudsman. If you have questions about 
filing a complaint against an employee, you may contact the Ombudsman by email at 
usaeo.VicfimOmbudsman@usdoj.gov. Questions concerning this case should be directed to office 
listed above. 
It is important to keep in mind that the defendant(s) are presumed innocent until proven guilty and 
that presumption requires both the Court and our office to take certain steps to ensure that justice is 
served. While our office cannot act as your attorney or provide you with legal advice, you can seek 
the advice of an attomey with respect to the rights above or other related legal matters.
