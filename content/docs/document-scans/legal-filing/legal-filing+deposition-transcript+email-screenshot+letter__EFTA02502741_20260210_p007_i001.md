Perhaps, though you haven't said so, you agree with Max, and want to en=ure that the survivor (me) does not have 
access to the funds and that they should go to you in addition to those of which you are already the benefici=ries. And 
that I should not have the right to leave anything to Valeria. If that's the case -- which is hard for me to believe -- I think 
it wou=d be best to say so straight out. If it's anything else, I just don=tB93 understand your letter. 
We have begged you to meet with us with a mediator. We renew that request. A mediator is a person trained to help 
different parties communicate and understand each other. This is what we want. We do not want to watch you engage 
in expensive legal battles, and we do not want to live in trepidation of the next angry and irrational email we might 
receive from you. 
You have received completely rational emails -- which are sometimes annoyed= and for good reasons. I still am shocked 
at the refusal to pay part of the taxes without extensive financial scrutiny, particularly after the facts that I have again 
described. I don't know what you have hea=d about "expensive legal battles," but I strongly suspect that it is as 
mistaken as your beliefs about my financial situation. I'=d be glad to meet, or more easily to have a collective phone 
call, but I cannot imagine why you want a mediator. If there are some issues, we can discuss them. In my mind at least, 
there is no adversarial conflict for which a mediator is in order. 
I do hope, again, that we can resolve this quickly. It is deeply disturbing, the one and only disturbing thing in my life. 
And un=ecessary, unless you have something on your minds that you have not told me. 
A few more comments below.

PS. About your earlier letter concerning the estate plan, though I responded explaining why you and Max are 
completely wrong about the Marit=l Trust, there are a few points I left out. 
One, I'm amazed, and not a little disturbed, that you have even looked into this in such extensive detail. These are 
matters I never paid any attention to until I started looking into my affairs and discovered what was being done by my 
advisers, as I've just one again described.=C2* I do not comprehend why you felt that you should undertake this inquiry 
--just it would have been unthinkable for me to have inquired into your affairs when you were making decisions I found 
questionable and was of course supporting them, financially and otherwise. 
But put that aside. 
The first sentence of your letter is Max's interpretation, which is fla=ly false, and surely ridiculous. We never thought of 
the crazy idea of setting up two separate Trusts, one to manage my "individual property," and the other for M to 
manage her "individual property." It amazes me that this idea could even occur to you. We had common property= not 
divided into mine and hers. Technically, almost all of it was my earnings, but it would never have occurred to us to 
regard that as my "individual property," or even to imagine separate "individu=l properties." Again, Eric suggested this 
pretense solely for tax purposes. We agreed, but the idea that you (and Max) express could never have occurred to us, 
and I find it hard to understand how it occurred to you. 
I have already reviewed the facts about the way the Marital Trust was estab=ished and the obvious intentions, so won't 
go through it again, but your acco=nt in the letter is entirely wrong, though it does exploit a legal technicalit=, and it's 
hard for me to imagine how this weird interpretation could eve= have occurred to you.
