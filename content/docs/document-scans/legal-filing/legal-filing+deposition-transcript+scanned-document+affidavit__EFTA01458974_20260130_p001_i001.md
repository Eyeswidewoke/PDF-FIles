World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
of trade liberalization, trade restrictions have risen sharply among the G-20 in 
recent years, as per UNCTAD data. We don't think any of these drags are 
going away. Therefore, Asian exporters may well have to settle for a new 
nor m& of anemic exports growth. Within the region, there are some additional 
challenges, starting with China's import substitution drive (which has hurt 
intermediate and capital goods exports from Japan, Taiwan, and Korea), rising 
cost of production (Singapore and Thailand). and failure to move up the value 
chain (Taiwan and Thailand). 
For aspiring economies like India and Indonesia, these developments are 
disappointing. The prevalence of regional excess capacity and weak G2 
demand for Asian exports will make it particularly hard for these economies to 
join the club of major export-oriented manufacturers. They will do better 
relying on manufacturing to satisfy domestic demand, in our view. 
Debt 
The rise in regional debt. especially in China, is tinder a great deal of focus, 
evidenced by a plethora of reports issued by multilateral agencies. Taking 
advantage of years of strong growth, favorable investor sentiment, relatively 
low rates, ample liquidity, expectations of stable currency, and supportive 
fiscal and financial sector policies, Asian borrowers have accumulated 
substantial debt in recent years. But the optimistic projections: as:it:timed with 
these borrowings have turned out to be mostly wrong. Both nominal and real 
growth rates have slowed, pushing down ROE, real rates have turned out to be 
high owing to sharp disinflation or deflation, and for those with foreign 
currency borrowing, expectations of stable currency have been off by a large 
margin due to the strong USD cycle. For those in the commodity sector, the 
risks are the greatest due to the combination of sharp revenue declines and 
soaring cost of servicing foreign currency debt. 
In addition to corporates, Asian households have amassed sizable debt in 
recent years, with Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and 
Thailand characterized by burdens amounting to over 60% of GDP. China's 
reported household debt figures are lower (slightly below 40% of GDP), but 
strikingly, its households have added more than 20% of GDP worth of debt in 
the past five years. Gross debt figures for wealthy economies like Singapore, 
South Korea, and Taiwan may be less alarming due to households' strong 
asset position, but for the rest of the cohort the high debt level can act as a 
major deterrent to the credit cycle and consumption outlook. High household 
debt may not be a source of systemic risk in the near term, but could readily 
become a chronic drag to growth. Unlike corporations, households don't have 
particularly orderly routes to restructuring debt. Hence firm level defaults and 
restructuring could form the headlines in the coming year, but the household 
debt burden that lies side-by-side could well be a bigger source of long-term 
headwind to the economy. 
Conclusion 
Against this background, Asian policy makers need to recognize the near-
term risk of deflation, debt, and trade dependency, and the medium-term 
risk of aging and lower potential growth. Aggressive demand generating 
policy in the immediate future and well thought-out structural policies to 
address aging and competitiveness are needed. The previously successful 
model of growing fast as a global beta is unlikely to be replicable for most 
Asian economies. The key is to recognize the challenges mentioned here 
and strive for a more domestically (and perhaps regionally) sustainable 
growth model
