House Report: US Intel Unprepared To Counter Threats From China. 
The Washington Post (9/30, Demirjian, 14.2M) says a new report from the House Intelligence 
Committee "warns that if the United States does not significantly change its approach to China, 
it will risk falling behind the rising superpower, creating economic, security and health 
consequences for decades to come." According to the Post, "The committee released a 37-page 
summary of the report on Wednesday, after the panel approved it by a voice vote. The 
document, written by Democrats on the panel, is the product of nearly a two-year investigation 
that began in early 2019." 
According to Politico (9/30, Matishak, 4.29M), the report concludes that "the U.S. 
intelligence community has failed to keep pace with the technological and political strides made 
by China over the last two decades, a lag that risks leaving policymakers permanently in the 
dark about a growing, strategic challenge to the country's national security. ... 'Absent a 
significant realignment of resources, the U.S. government and intelligence community will fail 
to achieve the outcomes required to enable continued U.S. competition with China on the global 
stage for decades to come, and to protect the U.S. health and security,' the summary warns." 
The New York Times (9/30, Barnes, 18.61M) reports the US "could fall behind in its global 
competition with China without additional resources to develop better intelligence on the 
Chinese government, and spy agencies must focus more on the challenge of pandemics and 
trade, according to a report by the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released 
Wednesday." The warnings "were similar to the conclusions of a Republican study on China also 
released Wednesday." While that report "has a wider focus, it too called for a more aggressive 
stance toward China and better defenses against Chinese theft of intellectual property and 
efforts to influence American politics." 
The Hill (9/30, 2.98M) adds that the report "said the IC places 'insufficient emphasis and 
focus' on 'soft threats,' such as viral pandemics and climate change, and that if the IC did not 
modernize systems to increase focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence, national 
security could be undermined." Foreign Policy (9/30, Mackinnon, 340K) reports that a 
Democratic official on the committee said on background, "COVID-19 cropped up as a very real 
world example while we were drafting and finalizing this report. At least for us it really does 
crystallize some of the nontraditional threats that can emanate out of China." 
CBS News (9/30, Gazis, 3.68M) says that the report, "based on hundreds of hours of 
interviews with intelligence officers and quality checks of thousands of analytic products, also 
evaluated the intelligence community's budget allocations. The final report includes more than 
two dozen public, and more than 100 classified, recommendations." Reuters (9/30, 
Brunnstrom) reports that the report "called for a broadening of programs to mentor the next 
generation of China analysts and said agencies should consider 'reskilling' programs for those 
working in counterterrorism." 
CNN (9/30, Cohen, 83.16M) reports that House Intel Chair Adam Schiff said "our nation's 
intelligence agencies have a lot of work to do to fully address the challenge posed by China." He 
added, "The stakes are enormous. We must do everything possible to accurately predict and 
characterize Beijing's intent, or we will continue to struggle to understand how and why the 
leadership of the CCP makes decisions, and fail to respond effectively. The good news is that we 
still have time to adapt." 
The Wall Street Journal (9/30, O'Keeffe, Strobel, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports 
that in a statement, DNI Ratcliffe said, "I'm glad to see that there's congressional recognition of 
what I've been saying since my confirmation: China poses a greater national security threat to 
the U.S. than any other nation." NBC News (9/30, Dilanian, 6.14M) reports that Ratcliffe added, 
"As DNI, I'm committing the Intelligence Community resources needed to fully understand the 
threat posed by China and provide policymakers with the best intelligence to counter China's 
activities." 
Fox News (9/30, Henney, 27.59M) also runs a report, as does Public Radio International 
(9/30, 28K), and the Washington Examiner (9/30, Dunleavy, 448K).
