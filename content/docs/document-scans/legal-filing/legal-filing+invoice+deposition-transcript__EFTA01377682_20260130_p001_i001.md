S- I/A 
income and expense historically consisted primarily of changes in the fair value of our customer warrant liability measurements. 
and to a lesser extent, interest expense on our capital lease financings, interest income on cash balances, and foreign currency-
related gains and losses. 
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists primarily of local, state, federal, and foreign tax. Our effective tax rate 
fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, the 
effect of acquisitions, the change resulting from the amount of recorded valuation allowance, the permanent difference between 
GAAP and local tax laws, certain one-time items, and changes in tax contingencies. 
As of December 31, 2014, we had $45.7 million of federal, $123.3 million of state, and $31.3 million of foreign net operating 
loss carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2032 for federal and 2019 for state tax purposes. The foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards do not expire. An annual limitation may apply to the use of net operating loss carryforwards under provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code and similar state tax provisions that are applicable if we experience an ownership change. As of 
December 31, 2014, we have performed an analysis on the potential limitations on the utilization of net operating losses and 
determined that as of such date they were not subject to any material limitations that would preclude the use of the net operating 
losses. We have not conducted an analysis to determine if an ownership change will occur as a result of this offering. Substantially 
all of our net operating loss carryforwards were subject to a valuation allowance as of September 30, 2015.
