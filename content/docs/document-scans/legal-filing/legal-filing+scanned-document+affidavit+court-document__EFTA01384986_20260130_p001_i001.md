be available for future issuance without further action by our stockholders, unless such action is 
required by applicable law, the terms of any other class or series of stock or the rules of any stock 
exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded. Although it 
does not currently intend to do so, our Board of Directors could authorize us to issue a class or series 
that could, depending upon the terms of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a 
transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for shares of our 
common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 
Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer 
In order for us to qualify as a REIT under the Code, our stock must be beneficially owned by 100 
or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part 
of a shorter taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). 
Also, not more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares of our stock (after taking into account 
certain options to acquire shares of stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly or through application 
of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer "individuals" (as defined in the Code to include certain 
entities, such as private foundations) at any time during the last half of a taxable year (other than the 
first taxable year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). 
Our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock that are, among other 
things, intended to assist us in complying with these requirements and to continue to qualify as a REIT. 
The relevant sections of our charter provide that. subject to the exceptions described below, no person 
or entity may actually own or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership 
provisions, more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the 
outstanding shares of our common stock, or 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of 
all classes and series of our stock, in each case excluding any shares of our stock that are not treated as 
outstanding for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We refer to each of these restrictions as an 
"ownership limit" and collectively as the "ownership limits." A person or entity that would have 
acquired actual, beneficial or constructive ownership of our stock but for the application of the 
ownership limits or any of the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock discussed 
below, and, if appropriate in the context, any person or entity that would have been the record or 
actual owner of such shares, is referred to as a "prohibited owner." 
The applicable constructive ownership rules under the Code are complex and, for instance, may 
cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and/or entities to be 
treated as owned constructively by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 
9.8% in value of our outstanding stock or less than 9.8% in the value or number of our outstanding 
common stock (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, our 
stock) by an individual or entity could nevertheless cause that individual or entity, or another individual 
or entity, to own, constructively or beneficially, in excess of 9.8% of our outstanding common stock and 
thereby violate the applicable ownership limit. 
Our charter provides that our Board of Directors may, prospectively or retroactively, exempt a 
person from the ownership limit with respect to a particular stockholder and establish or increase a 
different limit on ownership for such stockholder. As a condition to granting such exemption, our 
Board of Directors may require, among other things, the stockholder receiving such exemption to make 
certain representations and undertakings related to our ability to qualify as a REIT. In addition, our 
Board of Directors may require an opinion of counsel or IRS ruling, in either case in form and 
substance satisfactory to our Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, as it may deem 
necessary or advisable, in order to determine or ensure our qualification as a REIT. Our Board of 
Directors may impose such other conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with 
granting such exemption or waiver or creating a different limit on ownership.
