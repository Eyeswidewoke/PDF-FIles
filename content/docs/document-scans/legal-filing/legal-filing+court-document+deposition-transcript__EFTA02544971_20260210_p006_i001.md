• 
you need more information about a transaction listed on the statement or transaction 
confirmation; or 
• 
there has been an unauthorized transaction, other error or unauthorized access to your PayPal 
account. 
You must notify us no later than 60 days after the error first appears in your account statement. We will extend the 60-
day time period if a good reason, such as a hospital stay, prevented you from notifying us within 60 days. 
For any type of error, you can telephone PayPal Customer Service at (402) 938-3614. You can also notify us in writing or 
online by following the instructions below. 
If the transaction does not involve a PayPal debit card, notify us by either: 
• 
Using the form available in the PayPal Resolution Center 
https://www.paypalcom/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmth_complaint-view&nav=0.4 to file an 
unauthorized transaction report, or 
• 
Writing to PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O. Box 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950. 
If the transaction involves your PayPal debit card, notify us by either: 
• 
Logging into your PayPal account, going to the "Account Overview" page and selecting the 
transaction details for the transaction you wish to dispute. Then follow the directions provided for 
disputing the transaction; or 
• 
Mailing the Written Statement of Disputed PayPal ATM/Debit Card Transactions Form or other 
notice to PayPal, Attn: PayPal Debit Card Department, P.O. Box 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950, 
or faxing it to 303-395-2855. A link to the form can be found with the directions 
provided for disputing the transaction as noted above. 
If you notify us orally, we may request that you send us your complaint or question in writing (by following the 
notification procedures described in the paragraphs above) within 10 business days of providing us the oral notice. 
When you notify us (orally or in writing), provide us with the following information: 
• 
Your name and email address you used to register your account, and 
• 
A description of the suspected unauthorized transaction or other error and an explanation as to 
why you believe it is incorrect or why you need more information to identify the transaction, and 
• 
The date and dollar amount of the suspected unauthorized transaction or other error. 
During the course of our investigation, we may request additional information from you. 
Once you notify us of a suspected error, we will investigate your complaint or question within 10 business days (or up to 
20 business days for new accounts — accounts that have 30 days or fewer since the date of their first transaction). If we 
need more time, we may take up to 45 days to complete our investigation (or up to 90 days for new accounts, point of 
sale or foreign initiated transactions). 
If we decide that we need more time to complete our investigation (as explained directly above), we will provisionally 
credit your account for the amount of the suspected error. You will receive the provisional credit within 10 business days 
of the date we received your notice (20 business days for new accounts). This will allow you to have use of the money 
until we complete the investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive 
your written complaint or question within 10 business days (or 20 for new accounts), we will not provisionally credit 
your account.
