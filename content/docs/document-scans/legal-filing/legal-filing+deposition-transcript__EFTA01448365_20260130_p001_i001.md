Risks: 
• 
Balance sheet and collateral concentration in fine art. 
• 
Black is a market maker in Impressionist/Modern art. The foreclosure on collateral to repay art secured loans 
would most certainly have a negative effect on the market. 
Mitigants: 
• 
Quality of the fine art collateral: Black's portfolio includes many marquee works of art by marquee artists. While the 
number of individual buyers for this quality of art may be limited, it is broadened by the appeal to museum's (and even 
governments). Given the expected quality of Black's portfolio, we believe there would be significant interest by fine art 
collectors should the Borrower himself wish to sell or if DB were to exercise its rights on the Collateral. 
• 
LTV: DB's proposed structure will include all our standard diversification language, including a minimum 20 of pieces, 
each with a FMV of 2$1MM, the collateral value of each specific piece would be limited to no more than 20% of the total 
art collateral, the collateral value from any single artist would be limited to 50% of the total art collateral, and would only 
include pieces domiciled in the US. 
Risks: 
• 
Balance sheet and collateral concentration in Apollo. 
• 
The limited "float" of Apollo Class A shares with only 141MM shares issued and outstanding versus a fully 
diluted total of 372MM (38%). 
• 
Transfer Limitations per the 4/4/2011 IPO. 
• 
Conversion risks associated with the exchange of Apollo units to Class A shares. 
Mitiaants: 
• 
Historic Performance: The Managing Partners of Apollo (Black, Rowan & Harris) have worked together for more than 22 
years. They have a proven track record with $114.3BN in AUMs. including $39.2BN in private equity. $63.58N in credit 
and $9.4BN in real estate. They have consistently produced long-term investment returns in their private equity funds 
with a 39% gross IRR and a 26% net IRR on a compound annual basis since inception. In addition, the positive trends for 
the firm are expected to continue and the near term forecast remains strong. 
• 
LW: DB's blended LTV at loan origination is estimated at 43% ($500MM/$1.16BN collateral market value.) Total Bank 
debt blended LTV at loan origination is estimated at only 31% ($1.5BN/$4.8BN collateral market value). Assuming Black 
maximizes the borrowing power against his art ($1.25BN), only $0.25BN is reliant upon the liquidation of Apollo shares. 
At a floor price of $18.00/share, it would require the sale of only 13.89MM shares, which is only 9.85% of current 
outstanding shares, and only 3.73% of fully diluted shares. 
• 
Improved Liquidity: The Transfer Limitation increases to 15% on 4/4/14. for a total of 13.91MM shares (92.7MM Black 
holdinge.15), which is just slightly greater than the number of shares all Banks would need to sell at our $18.00/share 
floor price of 13.89MM shares. In the first year. due to the Transfer Limitation of 7.5% (6.95MM shares), at a floor price of 
$18.00/share. only 5125.2MM could be liquidated, which could be done in 5 days (assuming 100% of the market). This 
leaves $124.8MM in additional reliance on the art (5250MM Apollo supported debt-$125.2MM in Black Apollo liquidity). 
Adding this to the $1.25BN in debt reliant on the art results in only a 55% advance ($1.3758N/$2.5BN) against a high 
quality art portfolio. 
• 
Documentation: DB will require all necessary registration documents to be maintained and will also require Apollo 
consent to the pledge. These items will help to minimize any delays during conversion.
