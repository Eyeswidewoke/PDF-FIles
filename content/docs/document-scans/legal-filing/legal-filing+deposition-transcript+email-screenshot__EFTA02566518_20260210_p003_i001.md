SO.. what you seem to be saying is that it would be simple to program a =omputer to do well on IQ tests. I would love to 
see this! 
> The only thing that looks interesting to me in the WAIS is the =omprehension test, because I don't see a 
straightforward approach to =heat on them with narrow Al. I would like to expand exactly this =omain: making sense of 
the world. 
Yes 
> We don't have advanced problem solving ("these are the rules for =hess. how would you try to beat a beginner level 
player, a medium =layer, a top player most quickly?"). We don't have constructive =bilities. We don't have verbal 
creativity etc. 
I think most of the above is in fact implicit in some of the tests. =emember that factor analysis reveals a very rich 
structure of human =ntelligence, with 60+ specific identifiable abilities that feed into =t. 
> Please tell me if my take on the WAIS is wrong! 
I think you might enjoy actually taking it. (My wife, when she was in =raining, used me as a guinea pig for testing -- and I 
found taking the =est really interesting... and was surprised by what I found trivially =asy and what I found more 
challenging) 
» How do you know for sure what the "basics" are? 
> While the literal understanding of the Turing Test leads nowhere (or, 
> =ell, to the Loebner prize), I think that he had the right idea. 
> =ntelligence is reflected in the ability to participate in meaningful 
> =iscourse, 
It may be reflected, but such discourse is not a necessary consequence =f intelligence. A deaf mute could still be very 
intelligent. 
> which includes interpreting and creatively structuring the world. Many =f the things that the WAIS measures, like 
recognizing and categorizing =hapes, are prerequisites for that. Others might be acquired tastes that =merge on more 
basic functionality, like mental arithmetic. But a =oolbox is not an architecture. A collection of tubes, tires, pedals and 
=pokes is not a bicycle. 
Good distinction. The IQ tests require a suite of skills and abilities, =hich could in principle arise from numerous 
architectures.. 
> Some of the basics stem directly from the requirements of producing =dequate representations of perceptual and 
abstracted content (hybrid =ierarchical representations that can do associations, compositional =tuff, grammatical 
systematicity, learning and categorization, =nheritance etc.). Others come from the needs to get the processes of 
=ottom-up/top-down perception, reflection, memory retrieval, inference, =nalogy building etc. to work. And some have 
to do with the requirements =f translating between Mentalese (in Pinker's sense, not in Fodor's) and =atural language. 
I don't disagree with any of the above 
> I may delude myself in thinking that I know what the basics are. In =act, it is extremely likely that I do (every computer 
science problem =eems to be misconceptualized until it has been properly implemented). 
You must be familiar with what the classic Al guys (e.g., Herb Simon) =alled "the representation problem"
