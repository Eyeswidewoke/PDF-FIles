Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. 
person if you are: 
• An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, 
• A partnership. corporation, company, or association created or organized in the 
United States or under the nws of the United States. 
• An estate (other than a foreign estate), or 
• A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7). 
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in 
the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section 
1446 on any foreign partners' share of effectively connected taxable ncome from 
such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, 
the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a 
foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore. if you are a 
U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the 
United States. arcade Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status 
and avoid section 1446 withholding at your share of partnership income.
