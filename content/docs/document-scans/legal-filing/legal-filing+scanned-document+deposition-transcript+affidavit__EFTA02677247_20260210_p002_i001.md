Review of Split Dollar Arrangements. 
As you recall, the original rationale for implementing a split dollar insurance plan was to provide 
a tax efficient means by which funds could be available to satisfy a significant portion of the 
debts (related to your art collection) and estate taxes payable upon the death of the survivor of 
you and Debra. The original 1999 proposal by Roger Cammon of the Bryant Group anticipated 
retention of the policies until the death of the insured(s) and projected that the policies would be 
self-funding by 2011. However, the policies have not performed as projected. In 2010 they 
were "under water" (Premium advances exceeded cash surrender value) and absent a substantial 
(taxable) gift from you to the Trusts, Roger projected that Premium payments would need to 
continue for at least 10 more years for the policies to be self-sustaining. Since that time, 
performance in the joint life policies owned by Trust #2 has improved but Premiums will still be 
required for a much longer period that originally projected. In addition, continuation of the 
Agreements requires you to continue to pay income and gift tax on the Employee Portion, which 
amount will increase each year. 
In addition to poor performance, it became clear that there were other reasons to consider 
terminating the Agreements. First, they no longer achieved their original objective and therefore, 
do not warrant the additional expense required to maintain them. The $150 million of death 
benefit will no longer come close to satisfying a substantial portion of the debts and estate taxes 
anticipated on the death of the survivor of you and Debra. 
Second, a conclusion to terminate the Agreements is supported by AIF's conversion from a 
general partner in Management IV to a limited partner. Because the Agreements were entered 
into prior to 2003, they are afforded special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code and 
IRS Regulations—provided that they are not "materially modified" after 2003. Thcrc is some 
concern that the IRS will argue that AIF (which received no distributions from Management IV 
after the conversion) ceased business operations in 2007. Such event would terminate (or 
materially modify) the Agreements, with the risk that income and gift tax is imposed on any 
equity build-up in the policies (Le., net cash surrender value in excess of Premiums advanced). It 
would also mean that a different tax regime ("loan treatment") would have applied to Premium 
payments from 2007. Under this regime, income and gift tax on the Premiums are likely to have 
been higher than the tax you paid on the Employee Portion. As a result, there is a risk of the 
imposition of additional income and gift tax to you the longer the Agreements remain in place. 
For the foregoing reasons, it was concluded that the Agreements should be terminated, or 
"rolled-out". 
C. 
Various Proposals to Roll-Out the Agreements. 
1. 
2010 Proposal. Carlyn's first proposal (August 2, 2010), involved the Black 
Family 1997 Trust (the "1997 Trust") purchasing the policies from the Trusts at their cash 
surrender values. The Trusts would thereafter use the sale proceeds to repay AIF for Premium 
advances. This proposal was not implemented principally because there was insufficient cash in 
the 1997 Trust to acquire the policies and pay Premiums going forward. There were also 
unresolved tax issues and with the economy in recovery it seemed advisable to wait and see how 
this would affect the policies.
