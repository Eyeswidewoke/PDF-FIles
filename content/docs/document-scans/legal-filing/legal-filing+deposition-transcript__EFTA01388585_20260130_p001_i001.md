Earnings Preview 
REIT pullback & low bar could spark 
3Q rallies, but don't get too excited 
House view remains constructive for AEI 
fundamentals moderate 
Following a strong start to 2016 the REITs have traded off 10% since 8/1. The 
decline coincides with a 30bps rise in the 10-year yield and increasing 
probabilities of a Dec rate hike. While painful, the move has reset valuations, 
which now appear much healthier. As we have stated in the past, we think the 
REITs remain in macro limbo, with expectations regarding yields and overall 
risk appetites trumping bottom up trends. Given the DB house view, which 
calls for muted GDP growth, a stable 10-year environment, and no recession 
through 2017, combined with less aggressive REIT valuations, we think the 
stocks have a little room to run if 3O can exceed low expectations. 
Data Centers remain our focus, despite expected leasing volume decline 
Following several Q's of record leasing we think the Data Centers could be 
poised to see some moderation in 3O as activity naturally ebbs and flows. 
There are some concerns that public cloud players may take a pause in leasing 
activity following a rapid period of expansion, but with penetration of cloud 
workloads still low, we think any such pause would be temporary. Also, with 
the 10% and 14% drops in DLR and CONE, respectively since 8/1, we think 
expectations are low, making for an interesting setup for 2 names with secular 
demand drivers and above average growth prospects over the next few years. 
Strip valuations looking better. but Sports Authority optics could be a chal€enge 
Last O we got less positive on the Strips as valuations had gotten ahead of 
fundamentals. With the markets seemingly feeling less risk averse, the Strips 
have pulled back by 11%, easing valuation concerns. 3O could be optically 
challenging, however, as the impact from the Sports Authority bankruptcy, as 
flagged as it has been, finally hits reported SS NOI results. We will be more 
focused on how much progress has been made on releasing these boxes and 
who else might be next, with Golfsmith's bankruptcy a much smaller impact 
on the space. With still substantial relative value discounts in the space, we 
remain constructive on Buy-rated RPT, RPAI, and BRX. 
Slowing trends expected in the Apartments, Malls, and Office sectors..
We are looking for moderating fundamentals for the Apartments and Office as 
supply in gateway markets remains elevated and job growth has slowed. White 
the issues in S.F. and NYC have been making headlines for some time, we will 
be focused on L.A. where job growth has decelerated for the past 2 months 
and D.C. where trends have improved. SLG, however, appears to have had 
another good leasing O, with 2.3msf of YTD activity as of mid-September 
suggesting over 800ksf of deals signed with a couple of weeks left in 3O. 
„.Healthcare fundamentals healthy, but investment volumes remain soft 
Health care operating trends were positive In the Cr per data from NIC, as 
occupancy was up and rent growth improved versus last Q. Although we have 
been concerned about pending supply, demand appears to be healthy. 
Concerns about the acquisition environment, however, remain; with Sr. 
Housing transaction volume continuing to fall in 3Q and VTR's recent 
acquisitions in the life sciences and hospital segments also suggesting fewer 
opportunities in traditional Sr. Housing. 
Estimates, valuations, and risks 
Our target prices are based on our forward NAV estimates and earnings 
multiples. Risks are supply/demand imbalances and capital market conditions.
