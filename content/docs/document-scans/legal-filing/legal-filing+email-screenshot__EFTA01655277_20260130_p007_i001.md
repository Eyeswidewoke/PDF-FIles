Fox News (07/09, Phillips) reported that the China Select Committee is investigating major U.S. universities, 
including Dartmouth, Notre Dame, and the University of California system, over their ties to the Chinese 
Scholarship Council (CSC). According to the article, the committee alleges that the CSC program is a covert pipeline 
for Beijing to gain access to sensitive American research and technology, and may be indirectly subsidized by U.S. 
federal research grants. The article noted that Universities such as Notre Dame and Dartmouth have already 
terminated or plan to end their participation in the CSC program, amid concerns over potential espionage and 
technology transfer. The article did not contain a direct FBI mention.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Live Entertainment CEO Indicted for Orchestrating Conspiracy to Rig Bidding Process for Public University 
Arena 
KOMO News (07/09, Staff Writer) reported that a federal grand jury has indicted Timothy J. Leiweke, Co-Founder 
and Chief Executive Officer of Oak View Group (OVG), for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to rig the bidding 
process for an arena at a public university in Austin, Texas, the DOJ's Antitrust Division announced. According to the 
article, the indictment, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, claims that from 
approximately February 2018 through at least June 2024, Leiweke conspired with the Chief Executive Officer of a 
competitor. The DOJ said the alleged conspiracy involved rigging the bidding for the development, management, 
and use of a multi-purpose arena on the university's campus, referred to as the "Arena Project." "Timothy Leiweke 
allegedly led a scheme designed to steer the contract for entertainment services at a public university's arena to his 
company. Public contracts are subject to laws requiring an open and competitive bid process to ensure a level 
playing field," said Assistant Director in Charge Christopher G. Raia of the FBI New York Field Office. "The FBI is 
determined to ensure that those who disregard fair competition principles do not benefit from a rigged bidding 
process targeting our communities and public institutions." The Seattle Times (07/09, Bernard), KUSA (NBC-
9) (07/09, Snyder), KXAN (NBC-4) (07/09, Jones), and the Wrap (07/09, Patton) also reported on the story. 
Prosecutors Question Doctors About UnitedHeakh's Medicare Billing Practices 
The Wall Street Journal (07/09, Weaver, Mathews) reported that the DOA criminal healthcare-fraud unit is 
investigating UnitedHealth Group's Medicare billing practices, including how the giant company deployed doctors 
and nurses to gather diagnoses that bolstered its payments, people familiar with the matter said. According to the 
article, in recent weeks, former UnitedHealth employees said they had been questioned by prosecutors working for 
the healthcare-fraud unit. The FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General 
also participated in some of the interviews, the former employees said. The former employees said the 
investigators asked detailed questions about UnitedHealth's efforts to encourage the documentation of certain 
lucrative diagnoses, including testing patients, implementing procedures to ensure that medical conditions were 
captured, and sending nurses to patients' homes. The New York Post (07/09, Herzlich) and Reuters (07/09, Staff 
Writer) also reported on the story. 
DC Police and FBI Offer $40,000 Reward for Info on Shooting of Intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym 
ABC News (07/09, Peterson, Forrester) reported that officials have increased the reward for information leading to 
the person who fatally shot a 21-year-old congressional intern in Washington, D.C., last month. Eric Tarpinian-
Jachym, of Granby, Massachusetts, was killed on June 30 at approximately 10:28 p.m. after getting caught in 
gunfire in northwest Washington, D.C., police said. According to the article, the Metropolitan Police Department 
said on Tuesday that a reward of $40,000 is available for anyone who is able to provide information that leads to 
the "arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible." Police were offering a previous award of $25,000, 
but increased it by an additional $15,000 "thanks to a contribution from our partners at the FBI Washington Field 
Office," officials said. Investigators said they recovered the suspect vehicle last week and stated that while the 
shooting was targeted, Tarpinian-Jachym was not among the intended victims. D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith told 
reporters last week, "We do have some good video footage, and I say good video footage that's a little grainy, so 
we're bringing in the FBI to kind of help enhance the video resolution so we can see a little bit better." The 
Washington Examiner (07/09, Rosciglione) also reported on the story.
