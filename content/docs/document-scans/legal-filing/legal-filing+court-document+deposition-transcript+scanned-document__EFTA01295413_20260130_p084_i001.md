2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40263, * 
As of August 4, 2008, the date of the last checklist, there still was no site closure letter 
from the state environmental agency, no SBA approval, and Banco had not waived either 
condition. (Doc. No. 37 at 8O9.) In an August 5, 2008 email, Ansell explained to Banco 
what was needed before the loans could be presented to the CDC's own credit committee. 
The necessary items included a state approved remediation plan and escrow by Allred 
Metal sufficient to cover the costs of that remediation, the amount of which would need to 
be approved by the state. (Doc. No. 38 at 1040-43; Doc. No. 35-3 at 478.)" Ansell further 
stated that, "Completion of the CAP (Corrective Action Plan] could take an extended period 
of time." (Doc. No. 35-3 at 478.) Coco testified that "the burden of remediation is on the 
borrower-HI but that, in this case, the seller, Allred Metal, had accepted that burden, 
among others. ["14] (Doc. No. 39 at 1250.) Loadman testified that no one ever asked him 
for any of the additional documents that Ansell identified in his email to Banco and that, 
instead, Banco told him all he needed to do to obtain CDC and SBA approval was to have 
an indemnity agreement in place and funds in escrow sufficient to cover the costs of 
remediation. (Doc. No. 37 at 794.) 
11 Ansell stated that the CDC would not even consider finding the 504 loans until: 1) the LSA was completed and submitted to 
the NCDENR; 2) the NCDENR issued its official risk classification; 3) the CSA was completed and submitted to the NCDENR 
and a follow up risk classification determined by the NCDENR: 4) assuming the risk classification remained 'high or 
intermediate," preparation of a Corrective Action Plan ("CAP') officially quantifying the projected remediation costs and 
schedule. which must then be submitted to, and approved by. the NCDENR; 5) escrow by the sellers of 150% of the 
remediation cost as 'quantified in the CAP' and "approved by the NCDENR": and 6) execution of an SBA indemnification 
agreement by the sellers. (Doc. No. 35-3 at 478.) 
On or about August 11, 2008, Banco's Diane Gallion ("Gallion") issued a letter [9 5] to 
Loadman denying the loans due to his "inability to meet the conditions" of the original 
commitment letter, which included the requirement that the property be free of 
environmental contamination and acceptable to Banco and the SBA. (Doc. No. 37 at 856-
57; Doc. No. 35-1 at 427.) She noted that, according to the environmental expert retained 
by Allred Metal, remediation could take years and, due to that timeframe and the 
associated risk, Banco could not close the loan. (Id.) She stated, "These decisions are 
based on both the Bank and the regulations for the SBA 504 program." (Id.)i2
12 Gallion testified that, based on her experience. she knew any letter issued by the SBA would provide a caveat that any 
adverse change affecting the business could cause the SBA not to pay off the bridge loans. (Doc. No. 36 (Gallion Dep.) at 671.) 
She testified that an adverse change was not limited to environmental concerns, but could be potentially anything, including 
changes in 'personal, business, or affiliated industries, the companies they own, their financial condition, their structure, change 
in the market value of the property. anything that was germane to the original credit decision." (Id. at 629-30.) rim If the SBA 
determined that there was such a change. it could "choose not to participate," leaving Banco 'at risk until the SBA wires 
money." (Id.) In this case, she indicated that the remediation was "a big concern" because of all the unknovms associated with 
it, and because the lengthy time required increased the prospect that an adverse change would °cos. potentially leaving Banco 
fully at risk, (Id. at 631. 659.) She explained that she and Banco operated in 'minimizing, reducing. or eliminating anything that's 
a risk,' and, for that reason, they would not close loans where there was an unquantifiable risk that could prevent the SBA's 
participation. (Id. at 669.) 
Ansell agreed with Gallion's assessment. testifying that, in most instances, the SBA would want to have the remediation 
completed and a "no further action letter from the state. (Doc. No. 38 at 1087-88.) In the "yen/ unlikely" evert that the loan was 
approved prior to remediation, there was 'no way' the funds would be dispersed. (Id. at 1051-52.) Me stated that was "a real 
risk for a lender because it could "end) ) up with the entire deal" if something happened to make the SBA decide not to pay off 
the bar*. (Id. at 1051.52. 1085-86.)
