its neighbors or the international comm=nity. In the eastern Mediterranean, the government of Syria has deployed an 
array of modern anti-air missile s=stems to raise the costs of outside intervention in its ongoing civil war.=And in the 
Pacific, North Korea has already demonstrated its willingness t= employ anti-access capabilities with the sinking in 2010 
of the South Korean ship, Cheonan. 
Air-Sea Battle is not a military strategy; it isn't about=countering an invasion; it isn't a plan for U.S. forces to conduct an 
assa=lt. Air-Sea Battle is a concept for defeating threats to access and enabling follow-on operations, which 
could=include military activities as well as humanitarian assistance and disaste= response. For example, in the last 
several years, improved integration be=ween naval and air forces helped us respond to floods in Pakistan and to the 
earthquake and tsunami in Japa=. 
Normally, operational concepts are developed by commander= to carry out a specific set of actions in their area of 
responsibility. 1= contrast, the military services are using JOAC and Air-Sea Battle to guide their efforts to organize, train, 
a=d equip forces provided to operational commanders. Further, we are integra=ing these concepts into the tactics and 
procedures we develop to operate w=th our allies. This is similar to the effort in the 1980s to implement the "Air-Land" 
Battle co=cept and associated NATO concepts to defeat Soviet aggression in Central E=rope. That effort resulted in 
programs such as the JSTARS radar aircraft t=at we still use to track targets on land. And while Air-Land Battle was 
focused on a singular threat and region, the=idea of using a specific operational concept to guide investment is the sa=e 
approach we are taking with Air-Sea Battle. 
Breaking the "kill chain" 
Air-Sea Battle defeats threats to access by, first, disru=ting an adversary's command, control, communications, 
computers, intellige=ce, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; second, destroying adversary weapons 
launchers (including=aircraft, ships, and missile sites►; and finally, defeating the weapons an=adversary launches. 
This approach exploits the fact that, to attack our force=, an adversary must complete a sequence of actions, commonly 
referred to a= a "kill chain." For example, surveillance systems locate U.S. forces, communications networks relay 
targeting inform=tion to weapons launchers, weapons are launched, and then they must hone i= on U.S. forces. Each of 
these steps is vulnerable to interdiction or disr=ption, and because each step must work, our forces can focus on the 
weakest links in the chain, not each and=every one. For example, strikes against installations deep inland are not 
=ecessarily required in Air-Sea Battle because adversary C4ISR may be vulne=able to disruption, weapons can be 
deceived or interdicted, and adversary ships and aircraft can be destro=ed. 
U.S. forces need not employ "symmetrical" appro=ches to counter each threat -- shooting missiles down with missiles, 
sinki=g submarines with other submarines, etc. Instead, as described in the JOAC and Air-Sea Battle, we will operate 
across domain=. For example, we will defeat missiles with electronic warfare, disrupt surveillance systems with 
electromagnetic or cyberattacks, and defeat air thr=ats with submarines. This is "networked, integrated attack" and it 
will require a force that is designed for -= and that regularly practices -- these kinds of operations. 
Building a truly "joint" force 
Conducting operations across domains requires rapid and t=ght coordination between air, ground, and naval forces -- a 
level of integ=ation well beyond today's efforts to merely pre-plan and deconflict actions between services. This 
integration =an't be achieved effectively and efficiently on an ad hoc basis. Forces mu=t be "pre-integrated" -- before 
the fight begins. This compels u= to work more closely as we develop and prepare our forces. 
Today, for example, instructors from the Navy's "Top=Gun" school routinely train with their counterparts at the Air 
Force =eapons School. As part of Air-Sea Battle we are pursuing this type of inter-service cooperation between all the 
services, =s well as within each branch of each service. Just as in tactical aviation= we are expanding our doctrine 
integration to include additional areas of =ollaboration -- such as Army air-defense forces and Marine reconnaissance 
units. With the doctrine, procedures, inv=stment, and training included in Air-Sea Battle's initiatives, we are movi=g from
