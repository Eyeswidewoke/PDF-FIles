2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, 
was deteriorating, (doc. 64, ¶¶ 23-24); that, in ["55] July 2012, while the Plaintiff was 
touring Specialty's facilities in Mobile, Alabama, BTU and Brito represented to the Plaintiff 
that their business was growing, (id., ¶ 22); that, on May 10. 2013, during a meeting at 
BTU's office in Mobile, BTU and Brito represented to the Plaintiff that they were financially 
sound and that business was proceeding as usual, (id., ¶¶ 41-42); and that, at that time, 
Specialty was in financial distress, (id., 111132, 46)." Thus, based on the allegations in the 
TAC, the Court could determine that, by making the aforesaid representations, BTU and 
Brito assumed a duty to disclose facts regarding Specialty's alleged deteriorating financial 
condition." Similarly, the Court could determine that BTU and Brito assumed a duty to 
inform the Plaintiff as to the lack of fuel oil securing their transactions when they sent the 
Plaintiff the April 8, 2013 Warehouse Receipt, which, allegedly, was false and misled the 
Plaintiff into believing that fuel oil served as collateral for their repurchase agreements, (id., 
¶¶ 49, 57(I)). Accordingly, the allegations in the TAC support the duty to disclose element 
of the Plaintiffs suppression claim with respect to BTU and Brito. ['56] BTU and Brito 
make no other argument with respect to Plaintiffs suppression claim, (doc. 67-1 at 1-3), 
and the undersigned finds that said claim is sufficiently stated in the TAC. Thus, the 
undersigned RECOMMENDS that BTU and Brito's motion to dismiss be denied with 
respect to Plaintiffs suppression claim. 
22 Specifically, the Plaintiff alleges that. loin April 29. 2013. Brito filed a Motion for Judicial Dissolution as to Bizikering 
. 
based on allegations of financial misconduct' and. on July 18 2013. St filed an affidavit in support of that motion in which he 
stated that 
"Specialty [i.e.. Bunkering] (was) operating at a negative equity position . . . its liabdities exceedfedi its assets. 
. Specialty hald) no cash reserves. no available credit on terms that are viable to the continued operation of 
the business and this ha(d) no way to operate as it held( operated in the past." 
(Doc. 64. ¶11 32 46.) On November 14 2013 Bunkering filed for bankivptcy protection. (Id.. ¶ 2.) 
23 The undersigned notes that "(the Alabama Supreme Court) has recognized() (that) the law generally allows a business to 
keep confidential its internal operating procedures and data unless that information is specifically requested' r57] Freightliner. 
932 So 2d at 892 (citing Ex parte Ford Motor Crock Co., 717 So. 2d 781. 787 (Ala. 1997)). However, as stated above. the 
moment a party speaks it "assumes a duty not to suppress or conceal those facts that materially qualify the facts already 
stated." Id at 895. 
D. Plaintiffs "Fraud in Insolvency" Claim (Count VII) against BTU and Brito should 
be dismissed because there is no private right of action under the criminal statute 
that BTU and Brito allegedly violated. 
In Count VII, the Plaintiff alleges that, by concealing their insolvency, BTU and Brito 
violated section 13A-9-48 of the Alabama Criminal Code. (Doc. 64 at 58-65.) Specifically, 
the Plaintiff states that it "claims a private right of action against BTU and/or Brito for 
violation of [that section)." (Id., ¶ 113.) However, loine claiming a private right of action 
within a statutory scheme must show clear and convincing evidence of legislative intent to 
impose civil liability for a violation of the statute." Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Univ. of Ala.
