FX Blueprint: Dashing Buck 
Additionally, after the Central Bank of Mexico 
suspended the "stabilization" mechanism, we would 
not be surprised if a new "reserve accumulation" rule is 
installed if the speed of appreciation increases. While 
any potential negative effects in the currency will likely 
be short lived (barring any disappointment in the 
reform agenda) we have recommended tactically 
taking profits in our long held short USD/MXN 
recommendation 
(closing: 
11.96, 
entry: 
12.68). 
Investors willing to position for residual upside could 
benefit from still reduced volatility by entering some 
bullish options strategies (either 1x2 USD/MXN put 
spreads or knock-outs). 
Andean currencies may suffer relatively more from 
weakening fundamentals, but we think that the 
downside may be limited. 
In particular, we do not see much upside potential in 
the CLP, but the combination of elevated yield and 
relatively low volatility makes it an attractive carry 
proposition for those willing to position for the global 
recovery. Nevertheless, as fundamentals gradually 
weaken, the risk of intervention is also fading away. 
The recent correction in commodity prices, especially 
copper, has driven the CLP away from intervention 
levels (perceived to be around 460), to the extent that 
some statements by CB president Vergara vouching for 
a weaker currency took the market by surprise. 
Depending on its persistence, this novel shock to the 
terms of trade could worsen an already complicated 
current account 
balance. Additionally, economic 
activity seems to be entering the long awaited 
deceleration path. In our view, the carry trade on 
EUR/CLP is an attractive alternative to position for 
loose monetary policies at the core (current: 618, entry: 
616, target: 602, stop: 626). 
In Colombia, policymakers under-delivered in terms of 
FX market intervention after signaling that the currency 
was unacceptably expensive. Nevertheless, some noise 
remains due to proposed changes in pension funds' 
minimum return calculation. While it is difficult to 
determine the potential impact of this measure (early 
calculations point to a range of I bn to 5bn of USD 
demand), this should not have an important direct 
short-run 
impact 
in 
the 
COP 
(beyond 
market 
anticipation). With the currency trading around away 
from the perceived 1800 intervention threshold, we 
have recommended taking profits in long USD/COP

The PEN finally suffered a meaningful correction on the 
back of some news regarding the potential acquisition 
of a stake in a private oil company by a public one and 
weakening external accounts. But after briefly touching 
2.65, the currency recovered to the 2.60 level. Barring 
any external surprises, and taking into consideration 
the new boost to global liquidity, PEN should remain 
relatively anchored on the back of strong FDI flows but 
the change in CB intervention is evidently beginning to 
have the desired effect of increasing the volatility of the 
currency. Considering the almost non-existent carry, 
we recommend remaining neutral on USD/PEN. 
All in all the tide is beginning to change in LatAm FX. 
While some currencies still offer some attractive carry 
(BRL or even CLP) and other have some (medium-term) 
upside 
potential 
(MXN), 
gradually 
weakening 
fundamentals 
could 
increase 
the 
relevance 
of 
differentiation.
