The monastery comp=ex, a multi-building compound located on the eastern side of the 87-square-=ilometre island, is 
the only pre-Islamic Christian site known in the UAE. D=scovered in 1992 during an archaeological survey, the monastery 
is believed=to have been an important destination for pilgrims travelling along a trade=route to India. 
"We think quite a lot of visitors came to the monastery," said Dr=Elders. "These people wanted to be visited." 
A separate room for visitors was bui=t within the monastery complex itself, where pilgrims could pray or leave g=fts. Dr 
Elders, who is also the chief archaeologist for the Church of Engla=d, said the archaeological team believes the visitors 
might have been attra=ted to the site because it was founded by a saint, or holy man. 
<= style="text-align: -webkit-auto; outline: Opx; margin: Opx; border-style= none; padding: Opx; font-style: inherit; ">The 
archaeologica= team has unearthed only one body at the monastery site, but the discovery w=s a significant one. The 
church was built around the grave, which might hav= belonged to the settlement's founder, the same local saint whose 
presence brought travellers to the island. 
"Academically, it's fascinating and really import=nt," said Peter Hellyer, the excavation's project manager and a 
columnist f=r The National. "It explains a lot more about the heritage of this country.=Most people wouldn't know that 
history, that there was Christianity here be=ore Islam." 
Christianity spread throughout the Gulf between the years 50 and 350,=following the trade routes. The inhabitants of 
the 7th-century settlement p=obably belonged to the Nestorian Church, or Church of the East. Researchers=believe the 
wealthy community was made up of a mixture of people from along=the Gulf, and local residents who spoke Syriac and 
Arabic. 
The community probably=chose the site based on its location at the head of a natural sheltered har=our. 
A=chaeologists have discovered 15 types of pottery at the complex. The comple= itself comprises monks' cells, kitchens 
and animal pens surrounding a cour=yard with a church dominating the centre. The artefacts, including bowls, j=rs, glass 
vessels and ceremonial vases, reveal that the monks had ties to m=dern-day Iraq, India and maybe Bahrain. 
The settlement remained until about 750 a=d appears to have been peacefully abandoned. As Islam's influence spread, 
t=e community probably diminished slowly as the monks struggled to find new r=cruits. 
The newly opened archaeological site was excavated between 1993 and 1996 u=der the patronage of Sheikh Zayed, the 
founder of the UAE, who used Sir Ban= Yas Island as a retreat. Fieldwork had been halted until 2009 when Sheikh 
M=hammed bin Zayed, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, ordered excavation to resu=e. 
"W= are delighted to be opening this ancient site to the public, which gives v=sitors an insight into the rich history of Sir 
Bani Yas Island and the UAE,= said Sheikh Sultan bin Tahnoun Al Nahyan, the chairman of the Tourism Deve=opment and 
Investment Company (TDIC). "We are proud of our heritage and are=therefore focused on creating a multi-experience 
tourism destination where g=ests are able to enjoy a variety of activities, while protecting and preser=ing the history and 
culture of our country, as well as the natural environm=nt of the island." 
=span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 2=5, 255, 0);">The 65-square-metre 
archeological site, which is enclosed with=n a protective fence and covered as part of conservation and preservation 
e=forts, is part of an effort to highlight the history and heritage of the is=and. Envisioned as part of the Desert Islands 
tourism experience, a visit t= the monastery could eventually be part of a heritage trail that would incl=de other 
significant archaeological sites on the island.
