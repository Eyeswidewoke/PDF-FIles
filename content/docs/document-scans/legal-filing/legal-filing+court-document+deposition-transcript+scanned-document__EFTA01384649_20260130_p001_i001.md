The General Partner may establish one or more other investment vehicles to accommodate 
legal, regulatory, or other issues of certain investors (including a Levered Feeder Fund) (each, a 
"Feeder Fund Entity"). Each such Feeder Fund Entity shall acquire an interest in each Underlying 
Fund, as appropriate. Each Feeder Fund Entity will bear its own expenses and a pro rata share of 
the expenses of the applicable Underlying Funds, but not the expenses of the Partnership, the 
Levered Fund, the Offshore Fund or another Feeder Fund Entity. 
Possible Positive Correlation with Stocks and Bonds 
Typically, one of the objectives of an investor in incorporating a non-traditional investment 
such as the Partnership into a portfolio is to provide a potentially valuable element of 
diversification. However, there can be no assurance, particularly during periods of market 
disruption and stress when the risk control benefits of diversification may be most important, that 
the Partnership will, in fact, experience a low level of correlation with a traditional portfolio of 
stocks and bonds. 
Financing Arrangements; Availability of Credit 
The use of leverage is integral to many of the Underlying Funds' strategies, and an 
Underlying Fund's performance depends on the availability of credit in order to finance its 
portfolio. An Underlying Fund has the power to borrow funds and may do so when deemed 
appropriate by the Management Company, including to enhance the Underlying Fund's returns 
and meet withdrawals that would otherwise result in the premature liquidation of investments. An 
Underlying Fund borrows funds from brokers, banks and other lenders to finance its trading 
operations. Such leverage, which may be substantial, may also be achieved through, among other 
methods, purchases of Securities on margin, borrowing against existing positions and the use of 
options, futures, forward contracts, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, swaps, 
collateralized guarantees provided by affiliates or the Partnership or any other financing structures 
that could allow the Partnership to achieve a levered return. There are no limitations on the ability 
of the Management Company to cause an Underlying Fund to use any form of leverage in its 
portfolio for the benefit of the Underlying Fund, a particular class or tranche of investors, one or 
more Feeder Funds or any combination of the foregoing. The use of leverage will magnify the 
volatility of changes in the value of an Underlying Fund's portfolios and can, in certain 
circumstances, increase the losses to which an Underlying Fund's investment portfolio may be 
subject. 
An Underlying Fund may achieve better margin lending terms from certain of its prime 
brokers than are generally available to U.S. investors. As a result, the level of margin available to 
an Underlying Fund for its investments will generally be limited only by the credit decisions of its 
prime brokers. There can be no assurance, however, that such prime brokers will either continue 
such arrangements with an Underlying Fund or that such prime brokers and other lenders will 
approve extensions of credit to an Underlying Fund at the levels requested by the Underlying Fund. 
Any restriction on the availability of credit from such parties could adversely affect the Underlying 
Fund's performance. 
The access to and cost of capital also could be impaired by many factors, including market 
forces, judicial action or regulatory changes. Furthermore, banks and dealers that provide
