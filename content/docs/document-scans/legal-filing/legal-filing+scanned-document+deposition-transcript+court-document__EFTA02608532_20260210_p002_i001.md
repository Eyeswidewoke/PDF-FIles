reac=ed a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest=— a resolution entirely consistent with 
that of cases involving ot=er similarly-situated defendants. The system worked as it should hav=. 
Then, in c=me the feds. The United States Attorney's Office extensively and=aggressively investigated whether 
Mr. Epstein had engaged in a commercial =uman trafficking ring, targeted minors, or used the internet or trave=ed 
interstate in the process. But that's not what this =as and that's not what happened. That is precisely why=C2Othe 
federal authorities' ultimate decision to defer pros=cution to the state was the right one. 
=p class="MsoNormal"> <=span> 
However, the federally-demanded resolution =as not without conditions. The federal prosecutors insisted on 
various0=A0unorthodox requirements that Mr. Epstein's experienced defense t=am had never seen imposed on any 
defendant anywhere. Under the federally-f=rced deal, Jeffrey was required to request that the state 
prosecutors=demand the imposition of a thirty-month sentence that included both=C2Ojail time and the strictest 
conditions of probation: lifetime se=-offender registration. Those draconian measures were far more than w=rranted by 
the state grand jury's indictment and would not ha=e otherwise been required under the previously agreed-upon state 
dispositi=n. As part of this highly unusual deal, the government required =effrey to pay for a highly experienced group of 
attorneys to bri=g claims against him on behalf of a government list of asserted victims. J=ffrey was required to waive 
the right to challenge those claims without be=ng provided the asserted victim's identities by the government unt=l 
after he was incarcerated. Importantly, the feds' decision to =ecline prosecution in deference to the state in exchange 
for these0=A0extraordinary requirements was reviewed and approved at the multipl= levels of the U.S. Department of 
Justice. Jeffrey took full re=ponsibility, complied with the feds' demands, served his sent=nce, and in the process was 
treated exactly the same (including his t=me served) as any other state-incarcerated individuals. His con=uct while in 
custody was exemplary, and so characterized by the state cust=dial authorities. 
<= class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:Spt">Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to soc=ety. The challenges 
to his Agreement with the Government must al=o be understood as challenges to the millions Mr. Epstein paid to the 
asse=ted victims and their lawyers pursuant to that agreement. Amongst the=beneficiaries of the Epstein-Federal 
Government Agreement were the many vi=tims who collectively received many millions as a result of the 
conditions=imposed on Mr. Epstein that prevented him from meaningfully contesting civ=l liability — moneys that 
would be at issue if requests to invalid=te the agreement were granted. 
Our nation faces vitally important=challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human 
dignity.=C20 Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially =bout women in the workplace. But 
Jeffrey's offenses of yeste=year, which were entirely outside of the workplace, have long since been r=dressed by the 
criminal justice system. He fully and faithfully=has performed every promise and obligation required of him by st=te and 
federal authorities. In the spirit of the bedrock American be=ief in second chances and fundamental fairness, that 
chapter in Jeffrey 1-=;s otherwise-productive and charitable life should be allowed torclose once and for all.
