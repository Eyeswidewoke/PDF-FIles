which these employees were assigned," including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was politically motivated, then its 
culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All special-counsel activities—investigations, plea 
deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and convictions—are fruit of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due 
process. That Mr. Mueller and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin offers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or property, it is required to use fundamentally 
fair processes. The Supreme Court has made clear that when governmental action "shocks the conscience," it violates 
due process. Such conduct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that appear, under the totality of the 
circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entrapment. 
In U.S. v. Russell (1973), the justices observed: "We may someday be presented with a situation in which 
the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the 
government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction." It didn't take long. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), 
the court concluded that due process was offended by a prosecutor's "realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness' " that 
tainted the "very initiation of proceedings." 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton (1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have "power to 
employ the full machinery of the state in scrutinizing any given individual ... we must have assurance that those who 
would wield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibility for the attainment of justice." 
Prosecutors must be "disinterested" and make "dispassionate assessments," free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias violated due process 
because he had played a role, a quarter-century earlier, in prosecuting the death-row inmate whose habeas corpus 
petition he was hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not vitiate the taint but heighten "the need 
for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might otherwise be obscured," the justices wrote. A single 
biased individual "might still have an influence that, while not so visible ... is nevertheless significant." 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the inspector general, there is a strong 
circumstantial case—including personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire was initiated for 
political, not national-security, purposes. 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department presumption against investigating 
campaigns in an election year. And while impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-Attorney General Eric 
Holder emphasizes that impartiality is "particularly important in an election year," and "politics must play no role in the 
decisions of federal prosecutors or investigators regarding any investigations.... Law enforcement officers and 
prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any 
election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party." 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the case with the bureau's investigation of 
Mrs. Clinton's private email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But Crossfire was not a 
criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence investigation predicated on the notion that Russia could be colluding 
with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no discernible evidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time 
Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing the notion that it was initiated "for the purpose" of affecting the presidential 
election. 
The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers. But 
nothing in the public record suggests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative therefore hinges on 
the more generic assertion that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump's election, and that the Trump campaign reciprocated 
by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance and investigation, there's still no public evidence of 
any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to sow political discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to a lesser 
extent Mr. Trump.
