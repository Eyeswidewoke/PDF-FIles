trafficking, security-related issues). Hence, even if Tehran talks to the Taliban, the latter may 
still be a long-term headache for Iran rather than a real ally against the West. 
Iran Today and the US-Afghan Partnership Agreement: 
A Fearful Neighbour 
Broadly speaking, the Islamic regime in Tehran may have to reckon with Afghanistan as a 
problem for the foreseeable future. Indeed, there is still the risk of bilateral tensions, even 
without a triumph of the Taliban, especially in case of an attack by Americans or Israelis on 
Iran. Tehran has made it clear that any country that might serve as a base for such a US or 
Israeli operation would be targeted by the Pasdaran72. And if military manoeuvres are any 
indication, it appears that Tehran already sees its border with Afghanistan as a potential 
source of threats" for the foreseeable future. The Iranian-Afghan relations will depend, 
overall, on the American policy towards Kabul after 2014. And the 'Strategic Partnership 
Agreement', signed on 2 May, 2012, is definitely the sign of a situation that cannot be seen 
favourably by Tehran. Iranian Foreign Minister Ramin Mehmanparast made it clear that that 
such a bilateral relationship will be a source of instability for Afghanistan, and would put in 
danger the links with Iran74. Indeed he has some reason to be worried. The ratification by the 
Afghan Parliament on 26 May 2012 guaranteed an American military presence in 
Afghanistan after 2014, in particular Special Forces. There is no talk of permanent bases, but 
the agreement looks like a warning to neighbouring countries. It was expressed very clearly 
by Shukria Barikzai, the head of the Parliamentarian Defence Committee, when he said that 
'the document will rescue Afghanistan from the yoke of its neighbours'75. Of course, Afghan 
Foreign Minister Zalmai Rassoul said that Afghanistan 'will not be used against any country 
in the region' after 201476. The answer was particularly targeting the Pakistani fears of drone 
strikes. But obviously, the fear of Afghanistan becoming a safe haven for enemies planning 
attacks is also an Iranian concern. And the fact is that the US Ambassador Ryan Crocker 
quickly contradicted Rassoul, when he said: 'There is nothing in this agreement that 
precludes the right of self-defence for either party and if there are attacks from the territory of

internal problems and contradictions, some of them coming from history, are definitely not taken into 
account to explain the sad situation of the country.
