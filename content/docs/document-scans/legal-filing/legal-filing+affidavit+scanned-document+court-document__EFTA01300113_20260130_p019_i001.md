Attracting foreign investment was among the priorities of the ERE. Today, the "flight of 
foreign investors" from the UAE is widely discussed in the media, and is supported by both 
local and official reports. Does Your Highness really think that our national economy's 
dependence on foreign investment leads to future risks? In the frequent talk about the 
global financial crisis, does Your Highness have new plans to strengthen, develop or restore 
foreign investments to the country? 
We cannot use the term "flight of foreign investors" because there has been no "flight." What happened exactly 
is the drought of liquidity across the world immediately after the collapse of the American investment bank, 
Lehman Brothers, which marked the beginning of the global financial crisis. However, with this drought, the 
compilation of available sources of liquidity became the primary concern of investors, banks, and financial 
institutions throughout the world. Sizeable withdrawals, deposits and liquefaction of all financial centers occurred 
in the capital markets in the world. 
With regard to your point that the attraction of foreign investment has been among the priorities of economic 
mobility in the UAE; it is an inaccurate assumption. Investment plans have no limits or boundaries. There are 
foreign investments in the UAE, and the=2 OUAE in its turn has countless investments in many regions of the 
world. Investments imply promising opportunities in a favorable environment. This is what attracted foreign 
investment to the UAE, and the investment environment remains favorable in the UAE; the opportunities are still 
promising, and the UAE is still the most important regional center for business and international trade. Today, it is 
more promising than ever before, and the advent of smart investors to the UAE has not stopped.

"Security and profit" are two very important concepts for the investor, and it is known that 
the UAE has been a breeding ground for the development of capital in recent years. This 
was reflected on the arrival of the most prominent businessmen, major companies and 
famous brands to the country. The active UAE financial market contributed to the success 
of many companies, which turned into public joint stock companies, with billions of 
dirhams having been pumped into their capital. This means that thousands of investors 
were involved in the ownership of shares. Recently, however, we have witnessed legal and 
financial issues involving prominent names of UAE nationals. What does Your Highness 
have to say with regard to the investment community in the UAE on the capacity of 
governmental oversight of corporate governance and management of the shareholders and 
their rights? 
These legal issues are evidence of firm govemment20concem about good corporate governance and its 
commitment to sound accounting principles, rules of governance and transparency. The government is constantly 
working to develop bodies, procedures and safeguards. No one is above the law in the UAE, and whoever crosses 
the line will be sought by judicial authorities and legally tried.
