2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93633, * 
issue for trial." Id. In making this determination, this Court draws all reasonable riff] 
inferences in favor of the non-moving party. See Bd. of Ethic. v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 850, 
122 S. Ct. 2559, 153 L. Ed. 2d 735 (2002); see also Armbruster v. Unisys Corp 32 F.3d 
768, 777 (3d Cir. 1994). 
In Carroll's motion for summary judgment he sought "a determination that $72,720 in 
prepetition transfers and $42,420 in postpetition [sic] transfers from Debtor to North Shore 
Real Estate Corporation were fraudulent transfers, preferences or otherwise avoidable 
pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 544, 547, 548 and 549, and recoverable under § 550." (May 26, 
2010, Bankr. Summ. J. Mem. Op. 1, ECF No. 1, Ex. 3)(citation omitted) Carroll asserted 
that "North Shore [] failed to respond to the Trustee's discovery requests, and ... all of the 
Requests for Admissions were deemed admitted and, accordingly, there [were] no genuine 
issues of material fact and the Trustee [was] entitled to judgment as a matter of law." 
(Carroll Renewed Mot. Summ. J. 114, Bankr. Case No. 06-30009, Adv. Pro. No. 08-03048, 
ECF No. 30). 
North Shore asserted in its opposition to Carroll's motion to dismiss that it indeed 
responded to Carroll's requests for admission. It explained that its response came in the 
form of the affidavit of Dawn Prosser, wife of the debtor [*ig] in the underlying bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
After reviewing the record, the bankruptcy court found that "North Shore [] failed to 
respond to or answer any of Trustee's discovery requests, including the ... Requests for 
Admissions." (May 26, 2010, Bankr. Summ. J. Mem. Op. 2, ECF No. 1, Ex. 3). As such, it 
determined that the requests for admissions were deemed admitted. 
[HN15] Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7036 provides that Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 36 applies in adversary bankruptcy proceedings. Rule 36 of the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure, in pertinent part, provides 
(HN16I (a) . . 
(3) Time to Respond, Effect of Not Responding. A matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after 
being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written 
answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney... . 
(4) Answer. It a matter is not admitted, the answer must specifically deny or state in detail why the 
answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny it. A denial must fairly respond to the stbstance of the 
matter, and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, the 
answer must specify r20] the party admitted and qualify or deny the rest. The answering party may 
assert a lack of knowledge or information as a reason for fading to admit or deny only if the party 
states that it has made reasonable inqtery and that the information it knows or can readily obtain is in 
sufficient to enable it to admit or deny. 
FED. R. Civ. P. 36 (a)(3), (a)(4). 
After reviewing Dawn Prosser's affidavit, the Court finds that the numbered paragraphs in 
the affidavit do not correspond to Carroll's numbered requests for admission. Looking at 
the substance of the affidavit, the Court finds that the affidavit does not address all of 
Carroll's requests for admission. The requests for admission which are not addressed are 
deemed denied. See FED. R. Civ. P. 36 (a)(3).
