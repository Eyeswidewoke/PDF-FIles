person learning as he visited a classroom of masked fourth graders at a...private school." 
President Trump and Education Secretary DeVos "have threatened to withhold federal funding 
from K-12 schools that don't allow all of their students to return to physical classrooms." Pence, 
who appeared with DeVos, "visited a Raleigh-area campus of Thales Academy as part of a push 
to encourage more schools to reopen with in-person instruction." Pence is quoted as saying, 
"We're all gonna make sure schools across America have the support to open up and stay 
open." Later, Pence said, "Online learning is no substitute for in-person learning." 
Administration officials made a similar cases in media appearances on Wednesday. 
Surgeon General Adams said on Mornings On The Mall (7/29), "It is important we understand 
there are health impacts for shutting down. There are 4.2 million children behind on their 
vaccinations. Kids out of school are more likely to be obese. ... It is important that we 
understand there are health harms to staying shut down." 
HUD Secretary Carson said on WEWS-TVVi Cleveland (7/29, 106K), "Let's determine the 
risk based on science, not on hysteria." He added, "The likelihood of children being affected by 
this is very small. The number of children who have died from COVID is much smaller than the 
number who die from regular flu." 
Doctors Make Recommendations For Reopening Schools Safely. In an op-ed for 
the New York Times (7/29, 18.61M), physicians Ezekiel J. Emanuel, James Phillips, and Saskia 
Popescu write that to reopen schools safely, "we must ensure that all five of the core school-
based activities - transportation, time in the classroom, mealtimes, gym and extracurricular 
activities - are safe." They write that they have "created a school risk index to assess the 
dangers and offer recommendations to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, not only 
among students but also among teachers and other employees." The doctors go on to outline a 
series of measures that they say "will permit relatively safe schools and allow in-person 
education and as much socializing as possible." 
Weingarten: Florida, Arizona, Texas Teachers Could Strike Over Unsafe Working 
Conditions. 
Politico (7/29, Perez, 4.29M) reports American Federation of Teachers President Randi 
Weingarten "warned" Wednesday that teachers in Florida, Arizona and Texas are most likely to 
strike over unsafe working conditions due to the pandemic. Weingarten told Politico that is 
governors and local officials reopen schools while cases are spiking without addressing 
demands for safety measures, teachers cannot give acquiesce in negotiations ahead of the 
school year. He said, "You can't say, at the end, `Okay, I just give up.' You have to actually be 
true to your convictions. ... And if that means a safety strike as a last resort, that's what it 
means. If you believe that the safety and health of people are really sacrosanct, then you've 
got to be able to sacrifice for it." 
The New York Times (7/29, Goldstein, Shapiro, 18.61M) reports that on Tuesday, the AFT 
"raised the stakes dramatically by authorizing its local and state chapters to strike if their 
districts do not take sufficient precautions - such as requiring masks and updating ventilation 
systems - before reopening classrooms." The limes adds that "many unions, while concerned 
about the safety of classrooms, are also fighting to limit the amount of time that teachers are 
required to be on video over the course of a day." the Times adds that critics "see teachers' 
unions as trying to have it both ways: reluctant to return to classrooms, but also resistant in 
some districts to providing a full day of remote school via tools like live video - the kind of 
interactive, online instruction that many parents say their children need after watching them 
flounder in the spring." 
In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal (7/29, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), David R. 
Henderson, a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, writes that the 
pandemic may result in more parents realizing the poor job public schools are doing and choose 
home-schooling, private schools, or charter schools.
