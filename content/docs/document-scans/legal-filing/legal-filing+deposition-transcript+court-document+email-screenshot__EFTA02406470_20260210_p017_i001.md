In 2020, the brains=of multitasking teens and young adults are "wired" differently f=om those over age 35 and overall it 
yields baleful results. They do not re=ain information; they spend most of their energy sharing short social messages, 
being entertained, and being distracted awa= from deep engagement with people and knowledge. They lack deep-
thinking c=pabilities; they lack face-to-face social skills; they depend in unhealthy=ways on the internet and mobile 
devices to function. In sum, the changes in behavior and cognition among t=e young are generally negative outcomes. 
While 55% agreed wi=h the statement that the future for the hyperconnected will generally be p=sitive, many who 
chose that view noted that it is more their hope than the=r best guess, and a number of people said the true outcome 
will be a combination of both scenarios. The researc= result here is really probably more like a 50-50 outcome than the 
55-42 s=lit recorded through survey takers' votes. Respondents were asked to sel=ct the positive or the negative, with 
no middle-ground choice, in order to encourage a spirited and deeply =onsidered written elaboration about the 
potential future of hyperconnected=people. 
We did not offer a =hird alternative — that young people's brains would not be wired diffe=ently — but some of the 
respondents made that argument in their elaborat=ons. They often noted that people's patterns of thinking will likely 
change, though the actual mechanisms of brain func=ion will not change. 
Survey participants=did offer strong, consistent predictions about the most desired life skill= for young people in 2020. 
Among those they listed are: public problem-sol=ing through cooperative work (sometimes referred to as crowd-
sourcing solutions); the ability to search effectivel= for information online and to be able to discern the quality and 
veracity=of the information one finds and then communicate these findings well (ref=rred to as digital literacy); 
synthesizing (being able to bring together details from many sources); being strategica=ly future-minded; the ability to 
concentrate; and the ability to distingui=h between the "noise" and the message in the ever-growing sea of infor=ation. 
Here is a sampling =f their predictions and arguments: 
• 
The env=ronment itself will be full of data that can be retrieved almost effortles=ly, and it will be arrayed in 
ways to help people — young and old — na=igate their lives. Quick-twitch younger technology users will do well mastering 
these datastreams. 
• 
Millennials' brains=are being rewired to adapt to the new information-processing skills they w=ll need to survive 
in this environment. 
• 
"Memories are becoming hyperlinks to information triggered by keywor=s and URLs. We are becoming 
'persistent paleontologists' of our own ex=ernal memories, as our brains are storing the keywords to get back to those 
memories and not the full memories themselves," arg=ed Amber Case, CEO of Geoloqi. 
• 
There is evidence now that "supertaskers" can handle several compl=cated tasks well, noted communications 
expert Stowe Boyd. And some survey respondents noted that it is not necessa=ily only young adults who do this well. 
• 
Young people accustomed to a diet of quick-fix information nuggets wil= be less likely to undertake deep, critical 
analysis of issues and challen=ing information. Shallow choices, an expectation of instant gratification, a lack of patience, 
are likely to be common resu=ts, especially for those who do not have the motivation or training that w=ll help them 
master this new environment. One possible outcome is stagnati=n in innovation. 
• 
Another possibility, though, is that evolving social structures will c=eate a new "division of labor" that rewards 
those who make swift, corr=ct decisions as they exploit new information streams and rewards the specialists who retain 
the skills of focused, deep t=inking. New winners and losers will emerge in this reconfigured environmen=; the left-
behind will be mired in the shallow diversions offered by techn=logy. 
• 
There are concerns about new social divides. "I suspect we're goin= to see an increased class division around 
labor and skills and attention,=94 said media scholar danah boyd. 
• 
A key differentiator between winners and losers wil= be winners' capacity to figure out the correct attention-
allocation bal=nce in this new environment. Just as we lost oral tradition with the writt=n word, we will lose something 
big in the coming world, but we will gain as =ell. "As Sophocles once said, 'Nothing vast enters the life of 
mortals=without a curse," noted Tiffany Shlain, director of the film Connected and founder of=the Webby Awards.
