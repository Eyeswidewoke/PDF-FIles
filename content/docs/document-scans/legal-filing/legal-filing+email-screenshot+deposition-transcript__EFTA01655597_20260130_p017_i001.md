Walmart location in Pembroke. Authorities eventually found her van abandoned in a field miles away from her

Scammers Targeting Connecticut Doctors 
WFSB (CBS-3) (02/04, Williams) reported that the FBI and DEA want to get out a warning about a new scam 
popping up in Connecticut and across the country. Scammers are targeting healthcare professionals and 
threatening their license. According to the article, the FBI provided a copy of a fake arrest warrant the scammers 
used. The document is supposed to look like a federal indictment, and it says says a doctor is being charged with 
drug trafficking after something called "Operation Black Pistol." The article noted that while the document is fake, 
it's a real example of a scam happening across the country. The article quoted Steven Shapiro, special agent in 
charge of the FBI's New Haven field office, who said, "In the state of Connecticut alone, victims have lost between 
$30,000 and $800,000. Across the country, the numbers are closer to $10 million." The article outlined that 
scammers are targeting doctors, veterinarians and other healthcare professionals who are licensed to prescribe 
medications. The scammers tell the doctors they are being investigated for drug trafficking, and they could lose 
their license if they don't pay up. The article highlighted that Shapiro said, "We will never ask you to provide cash 
to make an arrest warrant go away. It's not how we operate. ... They are going to try and say don't get in touch with 
an attorney, don't get in touch with any loved ones, you stay on the phone with me until these cash leaves your 
account and comes to me." However, the FBI says that's the opposite of what you should do. If something doesn't 
sound right, hang up and call the FBI or DEA offices directly. The article added that the FBI also asks anyone 
receiving a call from a person claiming to be with the DEA or FBI to report the incident to the FBI at www.ic3.gov or 
send an email to NewHaven@FBl.gov. WTNH (ABC-8) (02/04, Zymaris) also reported on the story.
