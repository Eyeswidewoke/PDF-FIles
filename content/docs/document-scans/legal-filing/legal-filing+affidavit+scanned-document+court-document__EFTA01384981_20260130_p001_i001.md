(1) total shareholder return; (2) net income (loss) (either before or after interest, taxes, depreciation 
and/or amortization); (3) changes in the market price of the common stock; (4) funds from operations 
or similar measure; (5) sales or revenue; (6) acquisitions or strategic transactions; (7) operating income; 
(8) return on capital. assets, equity or investment; (9) gross or net profit levels; (10) occupancy rates; 
(11) expense; (12) margins; (13) earnings (loss) per share of common stock; or (14) market share, any 
of which may be measured either in absolute terms or as compared to any incremental increase or as 
compared to results of a peer group. From and after the time that we become subject to 
Section I62(m) of the Code, the maximum award that is intended to qualify as "performance-based 
compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code that may be made to any one employee during any 
one calendar year period is the Share Maximum with respect to a stock-based award and $5.0 million 
with respect to a cash-based award. 
The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan provides that upon the effectiveness of a "sale event" (as defined 
in the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan), except as otherwise provided by our compensation committee in an 
award agreement, the parties to such sale event may cause the assumption or continuation of awards by 
the successor entity in the sale event, or the substitution of awards by such successor, with appropriate 
adjustment to awards as the parties shall agree. lb the extent, however, that the parties to such sale 
event do not provide for assumption, continuation or substitution of awards, all stock options and stock 
appreciation rights shall become fully exercisable, awards subject to time-based vesting conditions will 
become vested and non-forfeitable and all awards with conditions and restrictions relating to the 
attainment of performance goals shall become vested and non-forfeitable to the extent provided in the 
relevant award agreement, and upon the effective time of the sale event, the 2014 Equity Incentive 
Plan and all awards thereunder shall terminate. In the event of such termination, we may make or 
provide for a cash payment to participants holding options and stock appreciation rights equal to the 
difference between the per-share consideration received in the sale event and the exercise price of the 
options or stock appreciation rights in exchange for the cancellation thereto or provide such 
participants with a specified period of time to exercise outstanding stock options and stock appreciation 
rights prior to the consummation of the sale event. 
Our Board of Directors may amend or discontinue the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and our 
compensation committee may amend or cancel outstanding awards for purposes of satisfying changes in 
law or any other lawful purpose, but no such action may adversely affect rights under an award without 
the holder's consent. Certain amendments to the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan require the approval of 
our stockholders. The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan provides that our compensation committee may not 
reduce the exercise price of outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights or re-price these 
awards through cancellation and re-grants or through cancellation in exchange for a cash payment 
without stockholder approval. 
No awards may be granted under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan after the date that is 10 years 
from the date of stockholder approval of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, and no incentive stock 
options may be granted after the date that is 10 years from the date on which our Board of Directors 
adopted the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. No awards under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan have been 
made prior to the date hereof.
