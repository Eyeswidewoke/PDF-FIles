44 Misc. 3d 280, *; 982 N.Y.S.2d 868, "; 
2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1404, ***; 2014 NY Slip Op 24083 
such sale proceeds because he resides as a rent-stabilized tenant at the Neptune Avenue 
premises. This claim belongs to Benevento and is not shared by Anthony, the other 
beneficiary and the [""20] co-executor of the estate of Julia, who is not a tenant at the 
Neptune Avenue premises and received his full share of such proceeds without any 
deductions. Thus, Benevento, and not the estate of Julia, is the real party in interest in this 
litigation. 
Moreover, it is undisputed that Benevento is the transferee of one half of the interest held 
by Julia, and, thus, the holder of a "beneficial interest" in 2784 LLC. Such [HN3] a 
beneficial interest has been recognized as conferring standing upon a party to bring a 
derivative action on behalf of a corporation pursuant to Business Corporation Law § 626 
(a) (see Bernfeld v Kurilenko, 91 AD3d 893, 894, 937 NYS2d 314 [2d Dept 2012]; Shui 
Kam Chan v Louis, 303 AD2d 151, 152, 756 NYS2d 534 [1st Dept 2003]), which has been 
held applicable to limited liability companies (see Tzolis v Wolff, 10 NY3d 100, 121, 884 
NE2d 1005, 855 NYS2d 6 [2008]). While this is not a derivative action, this beneficial 
interest likewise furnishes a basis for Benevento's individual claims against 2784 LLC and 
Burns, and the fact that [.192] Benevento obtained his interest through the estate of Julia 
does not deprive him of standing in this action (see Bernfeld, 91 AD3d at 894). 
Furthermore, Burns previously recognized and acknowledged both r..211 Neary and 
Benevento as members of 2784 LLC. An email by Bums dated February 9, 2009 (exhibit B 
to plaintiffs' opposition papers) stated that "the three Nearys 
. are direct owners" of 2784 
LLC. An email by Burns dated February 22, 2010 (exhibit 6 to Burns' motion papers) 
regarding distributions sent to Neary and Benevento inquired r8771 as to "[h]ow do the 
Nearys want their checks" and whether they wanted "[o]ne to Mary Ann or 1/3 to each 
sib[ling]." Burns, in this email, further inquired as to how he should distribute Julia's funds, 
noting that the checks would have to be made out to her estate, and he asked whether he 
should issue two checks, or one each with the co-executors name also on the check. He 
additionally stated, in this email, that he "only wanted] to hear from members," that "[t]he 
Nearys should elect if they want to vote as a group or individually," and that the 
Beneventos will have to "decide themselves." By an email dated February 24, 2010 
(exhibit C to plaintiffs' opposition papers), Neary responded that he wanted the check 
issued to him. 
Significantly, plaintiffs point out that Bums has already issued separate checks to them in 
payment of their distributions of [""*22] the net sale proceeds. and that they are now 
simply complaining that they did not receive the full amount due to them. Burns, in 
paragraph 17 of his attorney's affirmation in support of his motion, admits that plaintiffs 
have "received distributions." Thus, by such distributions, Burns has acknowledged 
Neary's membership interest and Benevento's beneficial membership in 2784 LLC and 
their rights to receive such distributions. 
Notably, in the December 15, 2010 decision and order in the Neptune Avenue action, 
Justice Partnow previously acknowledged that Neary is a member of Neptune LLC and 
that Benevento has a beneficial interest in Neptune LLC. Burns, in his attorney's 
affirmation, has admitted that both Neptune LLC and 2784 LLC "have identical members 
with only a slight difference in percentage ownership." Therefore, it follows that Neary is a 
member of 2784 LLC in his own right in the same way that he is a member of Neptune
