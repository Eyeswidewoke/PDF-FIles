Transmitt=l. 
ANY TENDERING STOCKHOLDER OR OTHER PAYEE WHO FAILS TO COMPLETE FULLY AND SIGN THE SUBSTITUTE FORM 
W-9 INCLUDED IN THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL MAY BE SUBJECT TO REQUIRED FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING 
OF 31% OF THE GROSS PROCEEDS PAID TO SUCH SHAREHOLDER OR OTHER PAYEE PURSUANT TO THE OFFER. SEE 
SECTION 13. 
Gross proceeds payable pursuant to the Offer to a foreign stockholder or hi= or her agent will be subject to withholding 
of federal income tax at a rate=of 30%, unless the Company determines that a reduced rate of withholding is applicable 
pursuant to a tax treaty or that an exemption from withholding i= applicable because such gross proceeds are effectively 
connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. For this purpose, = foreign stockholder is 
any stockholder that is not (i) a citizen or residen= of the United States, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity 
creat=cl or organized in or under the laws of the United States or (iii) an estate o= trust the income of which is subject to 
United States federal income taxati=n regardless of its source. The Company will determine the applicable rate of 
withholding by reference to a stockholder's address, unless the facts a=d circumstances indicate such reliance is not 
warranted or if applicable law 
(for example, an applicable tax treaty or Treasury regulations thereunder) 
requires some other method for determining a stockholder's residence. A foreign stockholder may be eligible to file for a 
refund of such tax or a portion of 
8 
such tax if such stockholder meets the "complete redemption", &qu=t;substantially disproportionate" or "not essentially 
equivalent to a dividend&qu=t; tests described in Section 13, or if such stockholder is entitled to a reduced ra=e of 
withholding pursuant to a tax treaty and the Company withheld at a highe= rate. In order to claim an exemption from 
withholding on the grounds that gross proceeds paid pursuant to the Offer are effectively connected with th= conduct of 
a trade or business within the United States, a foreign stockhol=er must deliver to the Depositary a properly executed 
statement claiming such exemption. Such statements can be obtained from the Depositary. See Instruction 10 of the 
Letter of Transmittal. Foreign stockholders are urged=to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of 
federal income =ax withholding, including eligibility for a withholding tax reduction or exemption and the refund 
procedure.

constitute the tendering stockholder Hs acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Offer and an agreement 
betwee= the tendering stockholder and the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. 
It is a violation of Rule 14e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") for a person, 
directly or indirec=ly, to tender Shares for his own account unless the person so tendering (i) has a =et long position 
equal to or greater than the number of (x) Shares tendered or 
(y) other securities immediately convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, the number of Shares tendered and 
will acquire such Share= for tender by conversion, exercise or exchange of such other securities and 
(ii) will cause such Shares to be delivered in accordance with the terms of the Offer. Rule 14e-4 provides a similar 
restriction applicable to the tend=r or guarantee of a tender on behalf of another person. The tender of Shares pursuant 
to any one of the procedures described above will constitute the tendering stockholder's representation and warranty 
that (i) such stock=older has a net long position in the Shares being tendered within the meaning of Rule 14e-4 under
