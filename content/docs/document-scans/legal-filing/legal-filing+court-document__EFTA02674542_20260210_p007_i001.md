Viet Nam, and somehow the Afghans aren't sending t=rrorist to Russia nor are the Vietnamese sending terrorist to 
America. Maybe this is the le=son that we should learn. 
It appears that May Day celebrations appeared in pre- Christ=an times, with the Festival of Flora, the Roman goddess of 
flowers,=and the Walpurgis Night celebrations of the Germanic countries. It is also associated with th= Gaelic Beltane. 
And many of the pagan celebrations were abandoned or Christianized during the process of conversion in Europe.= In 
the 19th Century, popularized by movements supporting worker's rights and in the United States the =ight-hour work 
day groups in Chicago decided to organize a non-violent general strike=on May 1, 1996. On 1891 May Day was 
formalized as an international holiday in Paris. It has since become =n official holiday in many countries where 
governments respect the will of working people. =nbsp;ln the last decade in the United States May Day has become a 
site for recognition =nd support for the struggles of undocumented immigrant workers. Having w=rk in a factory where 
new employees often would start their first day (night) grave-yard shift at 11:30pm and q=it before midnight, and next 
to the time-clock management posted a notice that said, "If you do='t come to work on Sunday, don't come back on 
Monday." </=> I truly support the idea as a celebration of worker's rights. &=bsp;In the last decade in the United States 
May Day has become a site for recognition and support for the struggles of undocumented immigr=nt workers. Also

from the prospective of =nions. 
As Harold Meyerson writes this week in The Washington Post in the article, How to ease economic anxietySince the end 
of World War II the expectations of economic security and mobility that were widely shared by Americans and this been 
re=laced by a pervasive economic anxiety. The problem is that anxiety won't change things. As Meyerson wr=tes, 
"neither will the majority of analyses of how we got into this fix, nor will most of the (relatively few) 
recommendations=as to how we can get out of it." Especially when people like former private equity banker and 
Obama administration offi=ial Steven Rattner, writing in the New York Times, "the lack of=wage growth owes much to 
the continuing effects of globalization, a trend that has benefited=the United States as a whole while hurting many 
workers." Good for Am=rica, apparently, but bad for Americans. Besides, he implies, who can do anything about 
globalization? It's as inexorable as the sunrise. 
But moving from a shareholder capitalism that has diminished most Americans' share of the national pie to a 
stakeholder capitalism=that distributes a greater share of company revenue to the workers who produce i= will require 
major changes to our political economy. It will require =ur remaining unions to organize millions of workers whom they 
don't enroll as members but wh= can nonetheless agitate for better pay and working conditions. It will re=uire 
Congress, state legislatures and city councils to set the kind of wage standards — and not just minimum-wage standards 
— that workers =nce were able to win for themselves before the advent of shareholder capitalism. It=will require the 
rebirth of the kind of economic left in the United States that =ave us the New Deal and the four ensuing decades of 
broadly shared prosperity. =nbsp;Tall orders all, but the alternative is just more anxiety, and all its attendant 
pathologies. 
Let's remember that when Mr. Bush took office took office following the stock market bubble, and left during the 
bursting of the housing bubble. Mr. Obama took office during the financial crisis and great recession. People 
forget=that employment during Mr. Bush's first term was very sluggish, and private employment was down 946,000 jobs 
=t the end of his first term. At the end of Mr. Bush's second term, private employment was collapsing, and there=were 
net 665,000 jobs lost during Mr. Bush's two terms. With public se=tor jobs down over the last several years (Federal, 
State and local layoffs) dragging down the economy,=now a couple of months into Mr. Obama's second term there are 
now 2,282,000 m=re private sector jobs than when he took office. To see the difference please download McBride's 
article who expects t=e economy to continue to expand and as such doesn't expect=a sharp sharp decline in 
employment as happened at the end of Mr. Bush's 2nd term. The =acts are that government jobs are down under the
