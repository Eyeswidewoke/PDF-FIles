then the pressure for an outcome closer to the original Vickers recommendation, to =e written into next year's Banking 
Act, will be intense. 
The universal banking debate will take another serious tw=st if the new leadership of Barclays ultimately decides to 
break the bank =p into a retail bank and an investment bank and broker/dealer. As extreme =s this sounds, the 
intangible costs in political and regulatory animus Barclays now attracts could suggest tha= a clean break makes sense. 
An arrangement that gave existing shareholders=a stake in both new institutions might be acceptable. 
Barclays would no doubt sell such a split as a smart comm=rcial move. But the political and regulatory subtext would be 
to undermine=the case that such banking agglomerations are both necessary and useful. A=though the French and 
German commitment to their own universal banking systems is very strong, such a split would =ertainly empower critics 
of the universal banking model in the EU and the =5. The Liikanen Group inquiry is due to report to the European 
Commission =n bank structure later this year. The Commission itself is then expected to issue its own recommendations 
on=bank structure. Both will certainly draw on the Barclays experience. 
The culture quest=on 
This bigger issue about the values of the trading floor i= going to prove hard to shake off. The role of securities divisions 
in dri=ing investment bank profits over the last two decades has predictably seen=a generation of securities managers 
rise to the leadership of investment and universal banks. While it is perh=ps unwise to generalise too much, most of 
these men have brought with them=the directness and self-belief that comes with surviving a career on the t=ading 
floor. 
They also bring with them a view of the market and of mar=et-making that is often at odds with the way most politicians 
understand t=em. Watching Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs trying to explain to the US =enate in 2010 why it was 
legitimate for Goldman Sachs as a market maker to be both long and short in the US pr=perty market at the same time 
reinforced the point. There is a yawning gul= between a trader's pragmatic view of financial markets and a wider 
poli=ical and public audience who generally interpret the market maker's pragmatism as cynicism, detachment and 
shor= termism, especially when it results in making a lot of money. 
Banks tend to be highly impatient with this public and po=itical ambivalence. Most banks' response to efforts at greater 
regulatio= of securities markets have often been rooted in the argument that these m=rkets are fundamentally a forum 
for free trade between consenting adults and should be treated as such. It is =his argument that the LIBOR-scandal, with 
its taint of market fixing, and =he persistent flow of suggestions of contempt for customers and clients, d=es so much to 
undermine. 
The events of the last two months have succeeded in cemen=ing for good the idea that the banking crisis of 2008 was 
ultimately the r=sult of unethical, 'casino' behaviour on the trading floor. Whatever f=ilings banks might have exhibited 
in their ethical standards here, the reality is that the banking crisis had i=s roots in poor lending and risk standards, and 
poor management of loan bo=k funding, rather than wild gambles or duplicity in the securities markets= The Vickers 
Commission explicitly recognised this by focusing on raising capital standards at the retail ban=s that make up the 
backbone of the British credit system. 
Recent huge losses in the Chief Investment Office at l P =organ and conduct like that of Barclays' traders have made this 
di=tinction far too subtle to insist upon politically. This may not matter mu=h in regulatory terms — regulators have 
already embarked on a wide range of securities markets reforms. But it wil= help embed the persistent political idea that 
retail banking is inherentl= 'safe' while investment banking and securities markets business is in=erently 'risky'. To which 
recent events have added the taint of suspect ethical conduct.
