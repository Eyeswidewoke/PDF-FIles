Alternative Asset Manager Initiation 
Earnings profiles in 2014 should also remain supportive, with increasing 
realizations generating good sequential distributable earnings growth for at 
least the next several quarters. However, longer-term as the economic cycle 
matures, fears of a slowdown or recession may percolate and this could 
become negative for the stocks if realizations begin to wane, especially if the 
Alts' valuations have improved significantly. This does not appear to be on the 
horizon for at least 2014 given current expectations for continued growth in 
the economy and a relatively benign interest rate backdrop. 
Longer-term however (-2017-19), we think it will become difficult to grow 
from potentially peak distributable earnings in 2015-16 for much of the group, 
given the firms will have likely exhausted a large portion of embedded gains 
through realizations. To combat this, the firms will need to maintain the current 
healthy pace of fundraising for at least the next 1-2 years and be able to deploy 
capital in attractive opportunities, which could become scarcer if capital 
markets remain robust. Growing fee-based assets and shifting the business 
mix toward traditional asset management will also help to reduce the negative 
cyclical impact to DE post the realization cycle. 
Other considerations and possible pushback on our generally bullish thesis 
(and discussed in more detail in the report) are: 1) higher interest rates will 
impede returns given higher financing costs for portfolio companies. 2) 
earnings are very difficult to model both in the short- and long-term, hence 
reducing conviction in stocks with low forecasting ability, 3) the 
corporate/partnership organizational and financial structure is complex & 
difficult to become comfortable with, 4) the units and their distribution 
structure are prohibitive for some investment portfolios, and 5) the public 
floats are low and there is long-term overhang as partners monetize stakes. 
Differentiating the companies 
As common as the industry trends are for these 5 Alts, the companies are each 
quite different in terms of business mix, heritage, management philosophies 
and earnings dynamics. Figure 3 shows a brief snapshot of key business mix 
differences - we provide a more detailed overview starting on the next page
