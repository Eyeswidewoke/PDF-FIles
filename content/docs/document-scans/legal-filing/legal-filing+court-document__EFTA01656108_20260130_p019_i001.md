• Hudson Institute: Strategic Challenges Facing the US—South Korea Alliance — Thursday, November 21, 2024. 
Location: Hudson Institute, 10:00 AM. President-elect Donald Trump will bring a new agenda and a different 
approach to the United States' alliances compared to the outgoing Biden administration. How should the 
second Trump administration balance US national security interests while building on Washington's strong 
alliance with the Republic of Korea (ROK)? The two governments recently "reaffirmed the shared vision, 
common values, and unwavering commitment to their combined defense posture and the Mutual Defense 
Treaty (MDT) as the bedrock of our security partnership." On the other hand, President Trump will face 
growing security cooperation among North Korea, Russia, China, and Iran as he begins his second tenure. 
• Hudson Institute: Big Ideas for America's New National Security Team — Thursday, November 21, 2024. 
Location: Hudson Institute, 2:00 PM. The next four years of American foreign policy will be crucial. From 
Afghanistan to Ukraine to Israel, the Biden administration failed to fulfill its commitments, and China, Russia, 
Iran, and North Korea have seized on this opportunity to increase their collaboration. America's global allies 
and partners have looked on nervously as this axis of authoritarians developed into a major threat to the 
American-led world order. Distinguished Fellow Mike Gallagher will join Palantir Chief Technology Officer 
Shyam Sankar and Senior Fellows Peter Rough and Nadia Schadlow to discuss what to expect from the 
second Trump administration and how Washington can change course by returning to hard-power principles 
and reasserting American dominance on the world stage.
