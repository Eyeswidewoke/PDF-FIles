further their =ibelous agenda, as Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard, I would appreciate seeing copies of the 
correspondence you might send to =urrent or former employees about this in the process of carrying out and concluding 
your investigation. 
your client, Lawrence =rauss, copied me on his February 23rd email 
communication to the Office of Equity and Inclusion. I am writing =o convey the University's position on its 
responsibility to =onduct administrative investigations into allegations of conduct that would violate institutional policy, 
if true. Because Dr. Krauss has =font size="4" class="">retained legal counsel, I am writing directly to you. You may 
=orward my communication on to your client. Without having =irst secured your permission, I did not think it was 
proper for me to copying =im on this reply. 
Our policy on the Prohibition Against Discrimination, =arassment, and 
Retaliation (ACD 401 https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd401.html) and its accompanying procedures (P20 — link 
to the procedures =s embedded in the policy document) directs the Office of Equity and Inclusion to conduct prompt 
and equitable investigations. Among =he points stated are that the Office accepts =nonymous complaints as well as 
direct complaints. University employees are required to =ooperate with any investigation or allegations of violations of 
this =olicy. Providing false or misleading information or failing to cooperate may result in disciplinary action. Individuals 
making a complaint or =participating as a witness in an investigation cannot be retaliated against. Any employee who 
engages in retaliation will be =isciplined. The Office of Equity and Inclusion does not make any findings until such time 
as it determines that it has completed its fact =athering. 
Our courts recognize that participants in an administrative investigation have a 
=rivilege against a defamation charge. In Paros v. Hoemako Hospital, 140 Ariz. 335, 681 P.2d 918 (Ct. App. Div. 2 1984), 
the court recognized that the employer's response to a notice of charge of =iscrimination filed with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission was absolutely privileged. In Miller v. Servicemaster by Rees, 174 Ariz. at 520, 
851 P.2d 240, 243 (Ct. App. Div. 1 1993), the court recognized the existence of a conditional privilege for employees to 
report perceived acts of sexual harassment as public policy dictated that employees must be protected from workplace 
sexual harassment. Cited approvingly, Carey v. Maricopa County, 2009 WL =50225 (D. Ariz. 2009). Both Paros and Miller 
were cases concerning discrimination and harassment under Title VII. =n addition to its obligations under Title VII, the 
University must also operate its educational programs and activities to be free from gender =discrimination under Title 
IX. 
The Office of Equity and Inclusion will proceed with its investigation as =outlined 
in ACD 401 and P20. The Office will =ot provide your client with its investigative file. We look forward to Dr. =rauss's 
continuing cooperation. Regards, 
Dear Naimah et al: 
Attached you will find a letter from my attorney, along with a letter he sent to 
Buzzfeed earlier in this week regarding the defamatory and false story =they were planning on printing. The story was 
then published =esterday morning. I wanted to add to his letter, to reiterate our concern about how your office was 
planning to follow up on the false and defamatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because this was initiated by 
an =nline entertainment news outlet with a clear agenda and established record of =propagating false allegations about 
me, rather than by any of the individuals they refer to as sources, this should not be considered = credible allegation 
worthy of investigation. I believe that our initial =discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. Whether or =ot you 
agree with this, there are =wo things I think are important to =stablish. 
Firstly, that the University should not propagate what can be false allegations 
from =such a source by presenting them directly to current and/or former employees or to others. To do so would be to 
further their =ibelous agenda, as Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard, I would appreciate seeing copies of the
