RISK FACTORS 
You should understand the risks of investing in the Notes and should reach an investment decision only after careful consideration, with 
your advisors, of the suitability of the Notes in light of your particular financial circumstances and the information set forth in this free 
writing prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus. 
In addition to the following risks, you should review "Risk Factors" beginning on page S-3 in the accompanying prospectus supplement 
including the explanation of risks relating to the Notes described in the following sections: 
• 
Risks Relating to All Note Issuances" in the prospectus supplement. 
The Coupon Rate for Each Quarterly Coupon Payment Period During the Floating Rate Payment Period Is 
Uncertain and Could be as Low as the Minimum Coupon Rate. 
You will receive a quarterly Coupon on the applicable Coupon Payment Date during the Floating Rate Payment Period that accrues at a 
rate equal to 3-Month LIBOR plus the Spread, subject to the Cap of 4.00% per annum and the Minimum Coupon Rate of 0.00% per 
annum. 3-Month LIBOR may be influenced by a number of factors, including (but not limited to) monetary policies, fiscal policies, 
inflation, general economic conditions and public expectations with respect to such factors. The effect that any single factor may have on 
3-Month LIBOR may be partially offset by other factors. We cannot predict the factors that may cause 3-Month LIBOR to increase or 
decrease. A 3-Month LIBOR that is less than or equal to zero will cause the Coupon Rate for the applicable Coupon Payment Date 
during the Floating Rate Payment Period to be equal to the Minimum Coupon Rate, and you will not be compensated for any loss in 
value due to inflation and other factors relating to the value of money over time. You should consider, among other things, the overall 
potential annual Coupon Rate to maturity of the Notes as compared to other investment alternatives. 
The Notes Are Not Ordinary Debt Securities and the Coupon Rate is Not Fixed for any Floating Rate Payment 
Period and Is Variable. 
The Coupon Rate is not fixed for any Floating Rate Payment Period, and will equal 3-Month LIBOR plus the Spread, subject to the Cap 
and the Minimum Coupon Rate, which may be less than returns otherwise payable on debt securities issued by us with similar 
maturities. We have no control over any fluctuations in 3-Month LIBOR. 
The Notes Are Subject to the Credit Risk of HSBC USA Inc. 
The Notes are senior unsecured debt obligations of the Issuer. HSBC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third 
party. As further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus, the Notes will rank on par with all of the other 
unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of HSBC, except such obligations as may be preferred by operation of law. Any 
payment to be made on the Notes, including the return of the Principal Amount at maturity and all Coupons, depends on the ability of 
HSBC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of HSBC may affect the market 
value of the Notes and, in the event HSBC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive the amounts owed to you under the 
terms of the Notes. 
Your Coupon Rate for Each Coupon Payment Date During the Floating Rate Payment Period Is Limited by the Cap. 
During the Floating Rate Payment Period, the Coupon Rate will be capped at the Cap of 4.00% per annum. As a result, you will not 
participate in any 3-Month LIBOR in excess of 2.95% per annum. YOUR COUPON RATE WILL NOT BE GREATER THAN THE CAP. 
The Notes Are Not Insured or Guaranteed by Any Governmental Agency of the United States or Any Other 
Jurisdiction. 
The Notes are not deposit liabilities or other obligations of a bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation or any other governmental agency or program of the United States or any other jurisdiction. An investment in the Notes is 
subject to the credit risk of HSBC. and in the event that HSBC is unable to pay its obligations as they become due, you may not receive 
the amounts payable on the Notes. 
Certain Built-In Costs Are Likely to Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Prior to Maturity. 
The original issue price of the Notes includes the agent's commission and the estimated cost of HSBC hedging its obligations under the 
Notes. As a result, the price, if any, at which HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. will be willing to purchase Notes from you in secondary market 
transactions, if at all, will likely be lower than the original issue price, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial 
loss to you. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your 
Notes to maturity.
