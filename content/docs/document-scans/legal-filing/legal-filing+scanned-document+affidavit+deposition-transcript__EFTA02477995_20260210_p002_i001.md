I did give you a bad number, and apologized as soon as i realized it. =n error that was an embarrassment for me , the 
fact that that th= accurate number is still way below what you agreed to pay , has falle= by the wayside.( the 
preposterous argument that the end of year transaction was Alans idea , which you now know was not =rue and that 
me not receiving Phaidon documents was une=plainable. was your justification though, for non - full payment =AO ) 
Hopefully You will recall that when you initially asked for my help= I declined repeatedly with the admonition that 
that having a financial arrangement is fraught with danger and could complitcate our friends=ip (as you will be 
unhappy paying what you will view as a large sum. while choosing to ignore=20 the financial benefits, ). In Bedford , I 
repeated=my concern. THe current circumstance is distressing to me , =AO I have done my utmost to keep you safe. 
and wil= continue to do so. reckless choices in accounting or otherwise does not bode well. at each turn = have put 
your interests first, including in some instances attempting to f=ght your choices. 
your current circumstance needs nuanced attention. as=you know, there are a few areas with very serious 
consequences. =.A0 whether it be , having Ada , form grats without review, =AO brad doing phaidon without review. 
payments make without review.merely in order to be=20 weaned , is one more high risk choice. review of outside 
accounting firms=C2 , CANNOT be done by brad. to have your accounting dept sit =n on Alans trust accounting lecture 
. in order to learn the filed is reminiscent=20 of elieen reading the tax regs. ( she =lso was going to take a course) 
I am here in New York today. =AO should you like to resume 
=C2
