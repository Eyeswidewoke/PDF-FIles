wro=e: 
> I offer this story in lieu of what may be GC missives and/or Burger Offic=onado issues that may not be forthcoming this 
week due to the holidays. En=oy my friends for it is an absolutely true story. 
> The title above could have been, "How I Cornered The World Twinkie Market=For 3 Hours." Yes, I did it. And here's 
how. 
> At 6:30 am this morning I realized that, my favorite childhood treat, wo=ld never again be produced by Hostess. 
Perhaps the brand and the recipe wirl be auctioned off to another bakery. Maybe Payard, Boulud or Greenberg's =ould 
become the new purveyors. But never again would that spongy, creamy g=odness, just a few molecules away from 
plastic, be delivered in what was u=til Friday that ubiquitous, individually-cellophane-wrapped-10-to-a-box fo=mat. And 
so I knew what I had to do. Like those who feared the disappearan=e of what is now labelled "Coke Classic," I had to 
stockpile. 
> Ebay is really the bastion of the apocalyptic economy. There is virtually=nothing one cannot procure on ebay. And so it 
was to this international el=ctronic exchange that I turned to commence the implementation of my strate=ic plan. My 
inquisitive nature was rewarded. There were 50 lots of 1-5 box=s each of Twinkies for sale from every corner of the US. 
And so I commence= the bidding. 
> Ebay is, in theory, a perfect market. If you have not used it, you must t=y. Be forewarned, however, that it can be 
addictive. Also, don't let your =pouse know. From the moment I disclosed the commencement of my quest to co=ner the 
global Twinkie Market, to become a Twillionaire, I became the targ=t of no small amount of ridicule from my wife and six 
year old son. "Let t=em laugh," thought I! "Soon they will come crawling, begging to share in m= secret stockpile of 
golden goodies!" Little did I know, however, that I w=s about to provide my son with the greatest crash course on the 
American E=onomic System ever devised. 
> So the bidding began. It started at about $1.150 per Twinkie (1.15 p/t). =Wanting to test the market and set the price I 
determined that my first lo= should include only a single box of 10. This would permit me to bid high,=thereby 
determining the effective price elasticity of demand for the holy =winky, without spending too much money. I entered a 
maximum bid of 5.0 p/t=(assuming that no one in their right mind would be willing to pay 5 bucks =or a Twinky) and 
watched the market develop. (N.B. There is generally rela=ively little action in a typical Ebay auction until the last 3-5 
mins; it'= like professional basketball in that respect). As the auction drew to clo=e perhaps 22 bids were lobbed in 
driving the price above 1.75 p/t! Lo and =ehold I won the first auction at 1.8 p/t. And so the bar was set. 
> As my confidence and thus my fortitude grew I started bidding on larger l=ts with greater precision. Sparing you the 
heart pounding high pressure ex=erience, before one knew it Twinky auctions were coming fast and furious.=There was 
one closing literally every 15 minutes from every corner of Amer=ca. And we were winning every one. Yes, my fellow 
Americans, by about 8:45=am my son George and I had cornered the US Twinky market much like the Hun= Brothers 
unsuccessfully tried to corner the silver market in the late 197=s (they ultimately failed but, for a brief moment, we 
succeeded -- read on=. 
> It was fascinating. We were actually bearing witness to American capitali=m at its finest while simultaneously 
assembling a strategic stockpile of T=inkies (previously thought to have a half-life approximating 1,000 years b=t in fact 
having a "best used by" life of only about 2 months). In any cas=, amidst our sugar fueled euphoria emerged a stunning 
dynamic. The price o= Twinkies on the World Twinky Exchange had more than doubled! Whereas we w=re paying an 
average of 2.0 p/t earlier in the day, the price had risen to=in excess of 4.0 p/t and we had assembled massive reserves! 
It was time to=engage in Twarbirtage and start selling off our Twinkies! Such an activity=would cause a bulge in our
