(PhysOrg.com) -- In an attempt to mimic the photo=ynthetic systems found in plants and some bacteria, scientists have 
taken = step toward developing an artificial light-harvesting system (LHS) that m=ets one of the crucial requirements for 
such systems: an approximately 10O= energy transfer efficiency. Although high energy transfer efficiency is j=st one 
component of the development of a useful artificial LHS, the achiev=ment could lead to clean solar-fuel technology that 
turns sunlight into ch=mical fuel. 
The researchers, led by Shinsuke Takagi from the Tok=o Metropolitan University and PRESTO of the Japan Science and 
Technology A=ency, have published their study on their work toward an artificial LHS in=a recent issue of the Journal of 
the American =hemical Society <http://www.physorg.com/tags/journal+of=the+american+chemical+society/> 
"In order to realize an artificial light-har=esting system, almost 100% efficiency is necessary," Takagi told 
<=>PhysOrg.com. "Since light-harvesting systems consist of many =teps of bacteria 
<http://www.physorg.com/tags/energy+transfer/> or plant leaves) is composed of regularly =rranged molecules that 
efficiently collect sunlight and carry the excitatirn energy to the system's reaction center. An artificial LHS (or =E2 
artificial leaf') attempts to do the same thing by using f=nctional dye molecules. 
Building on the results of previous research, the sc=entists chose to use two types of porphyrin dye molecules for this 
purpose= which they arranged on a clay surface. The molecules' tendency to=aggregate or segregate on the clay surface 
made it challenging for the res=archers to arrange the molecules in a regular pattern like their natural c=unterparts. 
"A molecular arrangement with an appropriate=intermolecular distance is important to achieve nearly 100% energy 
transfe= efficiency," Takagi said. "If the intermolecular distance=is too near, other reactions such as electron transfer 
and/or photochemica= reactions would occur. If the intermolecular distance is too far, deactiv=tion of excited dye 
surpasses the energy transfer reaction." </=> 
In order to achieve the appropriate intermolecular d=stance, the scientists developed a novel preparation technique 
based on ma=ching the distances between the charged sites in the porphyrin molecules a=d the distances between 
negatively charged (anionic) sites on the clay sur=ace. This effect, which the researchers call the "Size-Matching Ru=e," 
helped to suppress the major factors that contributed to the p=rphyrin molecules' tendency to aggregate or segregate, 
and fixed t=e molecules in an appropriate uniform intermolecular distance. As Takagi e=plained, this strategy is 
significantly different than other attempts at a=hieving molecular patterns. 
"The methodology is unique," he said= "In the case of usual self-assembly systems, the arrangement is r=alized by guest-
guest interactions. In our system, host-guest interactions=play a crucial role for realizing the special arrangement of 
dyes. Thus, b= changing the host material, it is possible to control the molecular arran=ement of dyes on the clay 
surface." 
As the researchers demonstrated, the regular arrange=ent of the molecules leads to an excited energy transfer 
efficiency <http://www.phys=rg.com/tags/transfer+efficiency/> molecules <http://=ww.physorg.com/tags/molecules/> 
and clay h=st materials look like promising candidates for an artificial LHS.<=> 
"At the present, our system includes only tw= dyes," Takagi said. "As the next step, the combination of=several dyes to 
adsorb all sunlight is necessary. One of the characteristi= points of our system is that it is easy to use several dyes at 
once. Thus= our system is a promising candidate for a real light-harvesting system th=t can use all sunlight 
<http://www.physorg.com/tags/sunlight/> . We believe that even photochemical reaction parts can=be combined on 
the same clay surface. If this system is realized and is co=bined with a photochemical reaction center, this system can be 
called an =E2 inorganic leaf.—
