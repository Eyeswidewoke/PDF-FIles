That is part of a longstanding trend: a growing disconnect between =merican society and the armed forces that claim to 
represent it, which has=many causes, starting with the ending of the draft in 1973. Ever since, military experience has 
been steadily fading from Americ=n life. In 1990, 40% of young Americans had at least one parent who had se=ved in the 
forces; by 2014, only 16% had, and the measure continues to fal=. Among American leaders, the decline is similarly 
pronounced. In 1981, 64% of congressmen were veterans; now ar=und 18% are. 
Seasonal factors, including a strengthening labour market and negat=ve media coverage of the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, have widened the gu=f. So have the dismal standards of education and physical fitness that prevail in 
modern American society. At a time of post-war int=ospection, these factors raise two big questions. The first concerns 
Ameri=a's ability to hold to account a military sector its leaders feel bo=nd to applaud, but no longer competent to 
criticise. Andrew Bacevich, a former army officer, academic and longsta=ding critic of what he terms the militarism of 
American society, derides t=at support as "superficial and fraudulent". Sanctified by poli=icians and the public, he 
argues, the army's top brass have been given too much power and too little scrutiny, with the=recent disastrous 
campaigns, and similarly profligate appropriations, the =lmost inevitable result. The second question raised by the civil-
military =isconnect is similarly fundamental: it concerns America's future ability to mobilise for war.=/span> 
During the Korean war, around 70% of draft-age American men served =n the armed forces; during Vietnam, the 
unpopularity of the conflict and e=se of draft-dodging ensured that only 43% did. These days, even if every young 
American wanted to join up, less than 30% would =e eligible to. Of the starting 21m, around 9.5m would fail a 
rudimentary a=ademic qualification, either because they had dropped out of high school o=, typically, because most 
young Americans cannot do tricky sums without a calculator. Of the remainder, 7m=would be disqualified because they 
are too fat, or have a criminal record,=or tattoos on their hands or faces. According to Sergeant Haney, about hal= the 
high-school students in Clayton County are inked somewhere or other; according to his boss, Lieutenant-Col=nel Tony 
Parilli, a bigger problem is simply that "America is obese.=#8221; 
Spurned by the elite 
That leaves 4.5m young Americans eligible to serve, of whom only ar=und 390,000 are minded to, provided they do not 
get snapped up by a colleg= or private firm instead—as tends to happen to the best of them. Indeed, a favourite mantra 
of army recruiters, that they are comp=ting with Microsoft and Google, is not really true. With the annual except=on of a 
few hundred sons and daughters of retired officers, America'= elite has long since turned its nose up at military service. 
Well under 10% of army recruits have a college deg=ee; nearly half belong to an ethnic minority. 
The pool of potential recruits is too small to meet America's= albeit shrunken, military needs; especially, as now, when 
the unemploymen= rate dips below 6%. This leaves the army, the least-favoured of the four services, having either to 
drop its standards or entice those =ot minded to serve with generous perks. After it failed to meet its recrui=ing target in 
2005, a time of high employment and bad news from Baghdad, i= employed both strategies zealously. To sustain what 
was, by historical standards, only a modest surge in Iraq =around 2% of army recruits were accepted despite having 
failed to meet aca=emic and other criteria; "We accepted a risk on quality," grim=ces General Snow, an Iraq veteran. 
Meanwhile the cost of the army's signing-on bonuses ballooned unsustainably, t= $860m in 2008 alone. 
That figure has since fallen, as part of a wider effort to peg back=the personnel costs that consume around a quarter of 
the defence budget. Y=t the remaining sweeteners are still generous: the army's pay and allowances have risen by 90% 
since 2000. In a role-play back at Se=geant Haney's recruiting station, your correspondent, posing as an a=mless school-
leaver, asked what the army could offer him. The answer, besi=es the usual bed, board and medical insurance, included 
$78,000 in college fees, some of which could be transferred to a =lose relative; professional training, including for 46 
jobs that still off=r a fat signing-on bonus; and post-service careers advice. Could the army =erhaps also overlook the 
youthful drugs misdemeanour your correspondent, in character, admitted to? Sergeant=Fred Pedro thought it could. 
It is a good offer, especially set against the bad jobs and wage st=gnation prevalent among the Americans it is mostly 
aimed at. That the army=is having such trouble selling it is partly testament to the effects on public opinion of its recent
