It is safe to assume that the setting of LIBOR will now be moved into the remit of the UK financial regulator. Brussels 
will tighten market abuse rules to apply criminal sanctions to tampering with indices like LIBOR. But the most 
significant political and regulatory outcome from these events will be to renew the debate about universal banking. 
Where this debate has to this point focused on scale, implicit subsidy and systemic risk, it will now focus on culture, 
personal character and contamination from the values of the trading floor to the rest of a banking institution. Because 
these things cannot be regulated, the probability is that politicians will focus on their political proxies, especially pay. 
The return of Vickers 
The link between what has happened at Barclays and the universal banking argument is trust. Preserving the 
universal bank model relies on public trust that the core retail functions of a bark and its trading activities can be 
properly and completely segregated. The UK Independent Commission on Banking chaired by Sir John Vickers 
proposed in 2011 that they could be preserved in a single institution but in separate entities, with the retail functions 
ringfenced with their own higher capital levels. The Vickers Commission recommended that all derivatives services 
should be kept outside this ringfence. 
The UK government accepted the argument that retail banks should be able to maintain some simple derivatives 
functions such as products for hedging currency risk for business clients. The Barclays experience is already 
leading politicians and commentators in the UK to argue that simple derivatives may be an oxymoron. Trying to 
define them may be a futile exercise, and one that will inevitably be gamed by banks. 
The UK government shows some reluctance to revisit its interpretation of the Vickers proposals. But if the British 
Parliamentary enquiry into the LIBOR issue now concludes that the government has erred on the side of trusting 
banks, then the pressure for an outcome closer to the original Vickers recommendation, to be written into next 
year's Banking Act, will be intense. 
The universal banking debate will take another serious twist if the new leadership of Barclays ultimately decides to 
break the bank up into a retail bank and an investment bank and broker/dealer. As extreme as this sounds, the 
intangible costs in political and regulatory animus Barclays now attracts could suggest that a clean break makes 
sense. An arrangement that gave existing shareholders a stake in both new institutions might be acceptable. 
Barclays would no doubt sell such a split as a smart commercial move. But the political and regulatory subtext 
would be to undermine the case that such banking agglomerations are both necessary and useful. Although the 
French and German commitment to their own universal banking systems is very strong, such a split would certainly 
empower critics of the universal banking model in the EU and the US. The Liikanen Group inquiry is due to report 
to the European Commission on bank structure later this year. The Commission itself is then expected to issue its 
own recommendations on bank structure. Both will certainly draw on the Barclays experience. 
The culture question 
This bigger issue about the values of the trading floor is going to prove hard to shake off. The role of securities 
divisions in driving investment bank profits over the last two decades has predictably seen a generation of 
securities managers rise to the leadership of investment and universal barks. While it is perhaps unwise to 
generalise too much, most of these men have brought with them the directness and self-belief that comes with 
surviving a career on the trading floor. 
They also bring with them a view of the market and of market-making that is often at odds with the way most 
politicians understand them. Watching Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs trying to explain to the US Senate in 
2010 why it was legitimate for Goldman Sachs as a market maker to be both long and short in the US property 
market at the same time reinforced the point. There is a yawning gulf between a trader's pragmatic view of 
financial markets and a wider political and public audience who generally interpret the market maker's pragmatism 
as cynicism, detachment and short termism, especially when it results in making a lot of money. 
Banks tend to be highly impatient with this public and political ambivalence. Most banks' response to efforts at 
greater regulation of securities markets have often been rooted in the argument that these markets are 
fundamentally a forum for free trade between consenting adults and should be treated as such. It is this argument 
that the LIBOR-scandal, with its taint of market fixing, and the persistent flow of suggestions of contempt for 
customers and clients, does so much to undermine. 
The events of the last two months have succeeded in cementing for good the idea that the banking crisis of 2008 
was ultimately the result of unethical, 'casino' behaviour on the trading floor. Whatever failings banks might have 
exhibited in their ethical standards here, the reality is that the banking crisis had its roots in poor lending and risk 
standards, and poor management of loan book funding, rather than wild gambles or duplicity in the securities 
markets. The Vickers Commission explicitly recognised this by focusing on raising capital standards at the retail 
banks that make up the backbone of the British credit system.
