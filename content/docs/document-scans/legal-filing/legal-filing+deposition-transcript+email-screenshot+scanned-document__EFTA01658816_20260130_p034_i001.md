troops of wrongdoing," though it "stopped short of calling the killings war crimes." However, 
"the highly redacted report singles out 'possibly the most disgraceful episode in Australia's 
military history,' and calls for the criminal investigation of 19 soldiers," presenting "a stark 
contrast to how the United States has examined its own actions." 
Pompeo Visits West Bank Settlement, Denounces BDS Movement. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/19, story 6, 1:35, Holt, 5.84M) said Secretary of State Pompeo on 
Thursday "stepped into controversy, visiting the disputed West Bank and Golan Heights, firmly 
taking Israel's side in the long conflict over the territories." NBC's Andrea Mitchell added that in 
an effort to "make it harder for [Joe Biden] to reverse the Trump foreign policy," Pompeo 
became "the highest ranking US official to set foot in an Israeli settlement, land the Palestinians 
also claim in the West Bank." 
The AP (11/19, Krauss) reports that in a "major policy shift" the State Department 
"announced that products from the settlements can be labeled 'Made in Israel." To the AP, 
Pompeo's visit to the settlement and the State Department announcement "reflected the Trump 
administration's acceptance of Israeli settlements, which the Palestinians and most of the 
international community view as a violation of international law and a major obstacle to peace." 
Axios (11/19, Ravid, 521K) reports, "Pompeo's announcement - two months before the end of 
the Trump presidency - puts another hurdle in place for Biden if, as expected, he seeks to roll 
back Trump's policies on settlements." 
Townhall (11/19, Barkoukis, 177K) reports Pompeo "announced the U.S. will now consider 
the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement as 'anti-Semitic' and will seek 
to defund organizations that support it." Speaking in Jerusalem alongside Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu, Pompeo said, "Today, I want to make one announcement with respect to 
a decision by the State Department that we will regard the global anti-Israel BDS campaign as 
anti-Semitic. ... I know this sounds simple to you, Mr. Prime Minister, it seems. It seems like a 
statement of fact, but I want you to know that we will immediately take steps to identify 
organizations that engage in hateful BDS conduct and withdraw U.S. government support for 
such groups." 
The Washington Post (11/19, Morello, Hendrix, 14.2M) reports critics "said Pompeo's 
announcements were designed more to buttress support among pro-Israel evangelicals should 
Pompeo run for president and may not survive after [Biden) is sworn into office." Similarly, 
Reuters (11/19, Amichay, Sawafta) says it is "unclear how many of Trump's decisions will be 
reversed by a Biden administration." The New York Times (11/19, Halbfinger, Kershner, 18.61M) 
and The Hill (11/19, 2.98M)provide similar coverage. 
Palestinians Mull Stopping Payments To Terrorists In Bid To Win Biden's Favor. 
The New York Times (11/19, Rasgon, Halbfinger, 18.61M) says that "in a bold move to refurbish 
their sullied image in Washington, the Palestinians are laying the groundwork for an overhaul to 
one of their most cherished but controversial practices, officials say: compensating those who 
serve time in Israeli prisons, including for violent attacks." The Times says Palestinian officials 
are "eager to make a fresh start with the incoming Biden administration," and are "heeding the 
advice of sympathetic Democrats who have repeatedly warned that without an end to the 
payments, it would be impossible for the new administration to do any heavy lifting on their 
behalf." 
Johnson Announces Biggest Increase In UK Military Spending Since Cold War. 
The Washington Post (11/19, Adam, 14.2M) says British Prime Minister Boris Johnson 
announced "the biggest boost in spending on Britain's armed forces since the end of the Cold 
War, vowing to end an 'era of retreat' and to 'stand alongside our allies.' Over the next four 
years, the British armed forces will receive an extra 16.5 billion pounds ($21 billion), helping it 
to develop cyber and space capabilities, modernize weapons and create an artificial intelligence
