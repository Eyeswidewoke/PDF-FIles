• New Phytologist is an electronic (online-only) journal owned by the New Phytologist Trust, a not-for-profit organization dedicated. 
to the promotion of plant science, facilitating projects from symposia to free access for our Tansley reviews. 
• Regular papers, Letters, Research reviews, Rapid reports and both Modelling/Theory and Methods papers are encouraged. 
We are committed to rapid processing, from online submission through to publication 'as ready' via Early View- our average time 
to decision Is <26 days. There are no page or colour charges and a PDF version will be provided for each article. 
• The journal is available online at Wiley Online Library. Visit www.newphytologist.com to search the articles and register for table
