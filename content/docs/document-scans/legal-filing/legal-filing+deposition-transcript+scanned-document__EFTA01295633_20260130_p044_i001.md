785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
"forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court" 
(quoting Bell, 5 F.3d at 66)); S. Atl. Ltd., 356 F.3d at 583 (observing r66] that a mandate 
must be "scrupulously and fully carried out" (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted)). 
Indeed, the district court itself recognized that we had "dictate[d] the general outcome to 
be reached (class certification) while leaving [the district court] to fill in the details." J.A. 
9886 (Order Den. Mot. for Recons. 8 n.2). Of course, the court could have, and did, 
evaluate whether certification was best under Rule 23(b)(2) or (b)(3). But it had no 
discretion to then find that the prerequisites of either rule were not met. As the court 
observed, Nucor's argument on remand that the workers had failed to satisfy Rule 23(b) 
"overlook[ed] the Fourth Circuit's prior holding in this case." J.A. 9704 (Certification 
Order).=• Thus, the dissent misstates the record when it maintains that our original decision 
did not "in any way" prevent the district court from considering predominance. Post at 75-
76. Indeed, following our instructions and findings in Brown I, the court proceeded to make 
the only finding it could under Rule 23(b)(3), namely, that "common issues predominate 
and that a class action is superior to any other method for adjudication of the claims in this 
case." The dissent is thus also misinformed when it states we are now certifying "a Rule 
23(b)(3) class (**67] action without any court ever finding that the Rule 23(b)(3) 
requirements are satisfied." Post at 78. 
24 The dissent also maintains that our mandate did not reach the question of predominance because we amended our original 
opinion in Brown Ito delete a specific reference to Rule 23(b)(3). Post at 77. Such a deletion, however, did not change either 
our mandate to certify - a mandate that required the court to find the workers lad met Rule 23(b) - or the district court's express 
understanding of that mandate. 
Given the fact that our prior ruling foreclosed the denial of certification on the basis of Rule 
23(b)(3), the district court needed some compelling reason to reconsider the question. Bell, 
5 F.3d at 67 (describing [HN32] the "extraordinary" exception to the mandate rule when 
there is "a show[ing] that controlling legal authority has changed dramatically"). But the 
court cited no such reason and, unlike the question of commonality, Wal-Mart provided 
none. Indeed, as the district court itself acknowledged, Wal-Mart only incidentally narrowed 
an inquiry into whether common questions predominate by clarifying what constitutes a 
common question in the first place under Rule 23(a)(2). J.A. 10971-72. 
V. 
More than seven years have now elapsed since the workers first filed their class 
certification r68] motion, and the district court twice has refused to certify the class. The 
nature of the allegations, the evidentiary support buttressing them, and the inherent 
cohesiveness of the class all demonstrate that the court's failure to certify was an error. 
[HN33] Rule 23 provides wide discretion to district courts, in part, to promote the ("922] 
systemic class action virtues of efficiency and flexibility. The realization of such benefits, 
however, requires that a district court exercise its judgment in a reasoned and expeditious 
manner. 
The dissent rightly observes that the majority presses forward "[o]n the road to its desired 
result." Post at 152. And that result is simple justice. At bottom, the workers seek nothing
