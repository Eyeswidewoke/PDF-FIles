2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82496, * 
"[T]he core component of standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-
controversy requirement of Article III" of the Constitution. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 
504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). Article III 
constitutional standing requires that (1) plaintiff has suffered an injury in fact -- an invasion 
of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or 
imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) that a causal connection exists between the 
injury and the conduct complained of; and (3) that it is likely, not merely speculative, that 
the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Ballentine v. United States, 486 F.3d 
806, 814, 48 V.I. 1059 (3d Cir. 2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted). 
Moreover, "plaintiffs in a putative class No] action must allege and show that they 
personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified 
members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent." 
Montanez v. HSBC Mortgage Corp. (USA), 876 F. Supp. 2d 504, 512 (E.D. Pa. 2012) 
(citing Klein v. Gen. Nutrition Cos., 186 F.3d 338, 345 (3d Cir. 1999)) (finding a concrete 
and particularized injury where plaintiffs alleged they paid too much for force-placed 
insurance, a causal connection where defendants allegedly worked to conceal kickbacks 
and redundant charges, and redressability where plaintiffs sought the "very conventional 
remedy" of money damages). 
Here, Plaintiff states facts similar to those in Montanez: "[o]nce coverage is forced on the 
property, Defendants charge the borrower, an amount they attribute to the AMIG forced-
placed premium, which is either deducted from the borrower's mortgage escrow account 
by the Defendants or added to the balance of the borrower's loan." (Compl. ¶ 33) But 
because "plaintiffs in a putative class action must allege and show that they personally 
have been injured," Montanez at 512, it is insufficient to make general statements of injury 
to the class without specifying injuries to Plaintiff himself. Plaintiff must state whether 
charges were deducted from his escrow account or whether his loan balance rig 
increased in a way that made it more difficult to resolve his mortgage situation. 
Regarding his own finances, Plaintiff alleges that "escrow funds of Plaintiff which were 
designated to pay insurance, taxes and other items were used to pay non-designated 
costs of Defendants, including kickbacks, reinsurance fees and ceded premiums, and low 
cost loan tracking services." (Compl. ¶ 102) Because "general factual allegations of injury 
resulting from the defendant's conduct may suffice" to state an injury at this stage of 
litigation, the Court finds this allegation sufficient to state an injury and establish Article III 
standing at this stage of litigation.° 
6 As the Court recognized during oral argument. "the typical case here is, there is nothing left in the escrow account" from 
which Defendants may deduct the premiums. Mfg Tr. 50. Instead, "Iirs very likely that [Plaintiff) wasn't paying [the excessive 
premiums] directly" and that "l'lf he was going to pay [such a premium]. he was going to pay it down the line, indirectly in some 
fashion, and even then, we don't know, because we don't know what equity there was in the properly." (Hr'g Tr. 30) 
Nonetheless, such factual determinations are inappropriate [9 21 at this stage, and the Court restricts itself to the allegations in 
Plairtiffs Complaint. 
In addition, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants charged him excessive premiums, which 
constitute an injury regardless of whether he ever actually paid them. For example, Plaintiff 
alleges that Defendants informed him in a letter dated July 6, 2012, "that insurance
