SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Secondary Opportunities Fund III. LP 
Rule'. Among other things, the Volcker Rule generally prohibits "banking entities' from sponsoring, or investing in. 
'covered funds' except to the extent permitted pursuant an available exemption. In addition, a 'banking entity" and its 
affiliates are prohibited from entering into certain transactions with (such as extending credit to or purchasing assets 
from) any 'covered fund' that the banking entity sponsors. organises and offers or for which it serves, directly or 
indirectly, as investment manager, investment adviser or commodity trading adviser. 
Although Deutsche Bank is a German banking corporation, it is treated as a bank holding company for purposes of the 
BHC Act. As a consequence. Deutsche Bank and each of its subsidiaries and affiliates (including the Manager) are 
"banking entities' for purposes of the Volcker Rule and, therefore, subject to its requirements. In addition, it is anticipated 
that the Fund will be offered to US residents on a private placement basis and will constitute a 'covered fund' pursuant to 
the Volcker Rule. As a consequence. the Manager will be required to comply with the requirements of the so-called 
'asset management exemption' under Section 
.11 of the rules to implement the Volcker Rule (the "Implementing 
Regulations"). 
The applicable US federal regulators have only recently issued final versions of the Implementing Regulations and 
these final rules are still being reviewed and analysed. In conjunction with the issuance of the final rules, US federal 
regulators have given banking entities until July 2015 to come into compliance with them; during this period, Deutsche 
Bank will analyse the final rules and devise the appropriate compliance strategy. 
If the Manager determines that the investments of the Fund present a conflict for or impair the ability of Deutsche Bank or 
any of its affiliates to conduct its business, in order to accommodate the compliance of Deutsche Bank and its affiliates 
with the Volcker Rule and the Implementing Regulations. Deutsche Bank and its affiliates (including the Manager) may 
discontinue activities with respect to certain of the investment activities of the Fund. As a result, the Fund may not be 
able to take advantage of Deutsche Bank's platform to the same extent as if the Volcker Rule and the Implementing 
Regulations did not apply. 
In addition, the Volcker Rule would impose material restrictions on the ability of a banking entity to provide financial 
support to, or enter into certain other arrangements that would be "covered transactions" (as defined in Section 23A of 
the US Federal Reserve Act of 1914, as amended) with or for the benefit of. a private fund. These restrictions will limit 
extending credit to or purchasing assets from a private fund. Accordingly, the Deutsche Bank Group likely will be 
prohibited from providing loans or other credit support to the Fund (or to other entities for the benefit of the Fund) and 
may be prohibited from guaranteeing the clawback obligation of the Special Limited Partner. The Fund (and any fund 
structuring vehicles and feeders) will also not be permitted to include the Deutsche Bank name (or any variation thereon), 
in their respective names. 
The foregoing is not an exhaustive discussion of the potential risks the Dodd-Frank Act and the Volcker Rule pose for the 
Deutsche Bank Group, the Fund, the General Partner, the Second GP, the Manager and the Investors. Moreover, the 
final Implementing Regulations may impose unforeseen burdens on, and may result in significant changes in the 
activities of, the Fund, the Manager and Deutsche Bank and its affiliates. Each Investor should consult its own legal 
counsel to determine how it could be impacted by the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Volcker Rule and 
other changes to US and German banking laws. 
Deutsche Bank Investment Limitations 
The asset management exemption under the Volcker Rule limits any investment by Deutsche Bank and its affiliates in a 
covered fund to not more than 3% of the fund's total ownership interest or invested capital (the 'per-fund investment 
limit'). In addition, total investments in covered funds relying on the asset management exemption by Deutsche Bank 
and its affiliates are limited to not more than 3% of Deutsche Bank's Tier 1 capital (the "aggregate investment limit'). To 
the extent Deutsche Bank and its affiliates have already made investments in covered funds organised and offered in 
reliance on the 'asset management exemption' equal to or exceeding 3% of its Tier 1 capital, then Deutsche Bank will be 
prohibited from making further investments in covered funds under the 'asset management exemption,' including the 
Fund, notwithstanding the per fund investment limit. 
While Deutsche Bank intends to commit up to the lesser of 2.9% of the aggregate Commitments and $29 million to the 
Fund, Deutsche Bank has yet to determine whether any such investment will be permitted under the aggregate 
investment limit.
