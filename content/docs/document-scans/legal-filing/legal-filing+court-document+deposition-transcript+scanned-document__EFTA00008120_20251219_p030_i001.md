Chapter 8: Your First Massage Appointment — Step-by-Step 
03 
When you finally meet your massage therapist for the first time, there may be 
some nonverbal communication required also, in the form of paperwork to 
fill out, like the actual massage therapist's intake form. "Why do I have to fill 
out these medical forms if all I want is a simple massage?" you may ask. Well, 
it's for your own good. Massage affects the entire body, and it's best if your 
massage therapist knows as much as possible about your health history. If a 
massage therapist doesn't ask you to fill out a form, however, it doesn't mean 
she doesn't care about your health; that's just her style, or the policy of the 
spa or health club where she works. 
Another type of communication you share with your massage therapist is 
both nonverbal and non-written — body language. Your massage therapist, 
by profession an expert in the language of the body, may try her best not to 
laugh out loud while your body silently struggles with embarrassment and 
anxiety at the prospect of getting your first massage. Just kidding! Actually, as 
you may imagine, massage therapists become very adept at making their 
clients feel at ease in a potentially uneasy situation. It's the little things they 
do (and don't do) that make the difference. It could be where they point their 
eyes or how they manipulate sheets and towels to make you feel protected 
and respected. It's the way they just relax and accept you when you make 
yourself vulnerable by being there. 
Besides, they're just as eager to make a good first impression as you are, 
partly because it's human nature and partly because they want you as a 
repeat customer! 
Getting comfortable 
In most massage situations, after you arrive and go through your communica-
tion rituals, the next step is undressing and lying down. This can be tricky. 
It's the moment many people dread, and the one that keeps them from ever 
getting a "real" massage. The way it works is like this: 
1. The massage therapist explains how you're supposed to get up on the 
massage table, pointing out where your head should be, and whether 
you should be face up or facedown. If you ask whether you should get 
completely undressed or not, the stock answer is something to the effect 
of, "Most people take all their clothes off, but you can get undressed to the 
level of your comfort." Then she leaves the room. Do not feel intimidated 
by "most people" who all so bravely get naked for their massages. it's up 
to you if you want to keep your underwear or some clothes on, and It's OK 
either way. Refer to Rule # 8 in Chapter 7, "It's cool to be nude (or not)." 
2. After the massage therapist is out of the room, remember to take your 
time. Don't worry about getting barged in on, cause it ain't gonna 
happen. She knocks before coming back in, and usually she waits much 
longer than necessary to make sure you have plenty of time. Take this 
opportunity to remove Jewelry, watches, and anything else that may
