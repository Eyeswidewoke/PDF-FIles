United States Courts Opinions: Supreme Court of New York: Neary v Burns US Official 
News April 1, 2014 Tuesday 
5405 Tuckerman Lane #231 
N. Bethesda, MD 20852 
Carolyn E. Demarest, J. 
In this action by plaintiffs Thomas J. Neary (Neary) and Salvatore Benevento (Benevento) 
(collectively, plaintiffs) against defendants 2784 West 15th Street, LLC (2784 LLC) and 
Arthur Burns (Burns), Burns moves for an order, pursuant to CPLR 3211, dismissing 
plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and awarding him full reimbursement of his legal fees 
and costs. 
BACKGROUND 
Salvatore Judice (Mr. Judice) was the owner of two parcels of real property. One of these 
parcels is located at 2776, 2778, and 2784 West 15th Street, in Brooklyn (Block 8996, Lots 
89, 91, and 92) (the 2784 premises), and the other parcel is at located at 363-367 Neptune 
Avenue, in Brooklyn (the Neptune Avenue premises). The Neptune Avenue premises 
consists of two buildings with six units in each of them. When Mr. Judice died in 1973, he 
left the 2784 premises and the Neptune Avenue premises to his five children, i.e., Grace 
Burns (Grace), Anna Neary (Anna), Lucy Judice (Lucy), John E. Judice (John), and Julia J. 
Benevento (Julia), and, by subsequent deeds, both of these premises were conveyed to 
them as tenants in common. Plaintiffs Neary and Benevento have resided virtually their 
entire lives in residential apartments in the building at 367 Neptune Avenue within the 
Neptune Avenue premises as rent-stabilized tenants. Anna died in 1987, and she left her 
estate to her husband, Thomas J. Neary, Sr. (Thomas), who died on August 2, 2004. 
Thomas' estate passed to plaintiff Thomas Neary, Salvatore Neary (Salvatore), and Mary 
Ann Peraccio (Mary Ann), who thereby inherited Thomas' ownership interest both in the 
2784 premises and the Neptune Avenue premises. 
In 2006, the family members that held interests in the 2784 premises and the Neptune 
Avenue premises agreed to form two limited liability companies (LLCs), i.e., 2784 LLC and 
363-367 Neptune Avenue. LLC (Neptune LLC), to which their respective interests in these 
properties would be transferred, with Ray McRory, Esq. acting as their attorney. On 
November 10, 2006, the Operating Agreement of 2784 LLC was executed by its initial 
members, who were listed as: Grace (by Burns, as her attorney-in-fact), Julia (by 
Benevento, as her attorney-in-fact), Neary, Salvatore, and Mary Ann. An almost identical 
Operating Agreement of Neptune LLC was also executed by these members on the same 
date. The members conveyed their interests in the 2784 premises to 2784 LLC and their 
interests in the Neptune Avenue premises to Neptune LLC. Pursuant to the Operating 
Agreements, Burns was named the manager of both LLCs. 
Thereafter, John died on March 28, 2007 and his estate passed to Carmel Salerno, 
Patricia Judice, Joanne Judice Rafaella, and Salvatore Judice (Judice). The Estate of John 
['2]conveyed its interests in the 2784 premises and the Neptune Avenue premises to the 
two LLCs. Lucy Judice died without having children, and her estate conveyed its interest in 
the 2784 premises and the Neptune Avenue premises to the two LLCs. To reflect these 
changes, on November 1, 2007, an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement for 2784 
LLC was executed by all of the initial members, and by the Estate of John (by Judice, as 
the executor), as a new member. Schedule A to 2784 LLC's Operating Agreement
