The Whiteside* Lab 
Whitesides' accomplishments added up to a long list of groundbreaking contributions (see 
Exhibit 11 for Whitesides' publications)—from bioengineering, in which he developed methods to 
use catalysts (enzymes) from cells to facilitate organic synthesis, to the field of microfluidics. 
Whitesides' research spanned a broad spectrum of disciplines, from biochemistry to materials 
science. Over the years, much of his work remained in areas with implications for biotechnology: self-
assembling molecules to make nanomachines, polyvalent drugs to attack disease from multiple 
directions, and new analytical tools for drug discovery. More recently, his work focused on 
nanotechnology. Whitesides' research could readily be applied to practical problems: "George has a 
very broad view of science and technology, and has appreciated what basic research can do to inform 
new kinds of applications," Art Ellis explained, "and he and his coworkers have often published 
what might be called proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate how something they did in 
basic research can be applied in some areas of technology." 
Scientists spurned efforts to quantify their contributions, and Whitesides himself was particularly 
guarded about applying quantitative measures.14 For example, few people knew he was intimately 
involved in founding over a dozen companies. Whitesides was highly sought as an advisor to large 
firms, startups, and government agencies, too. Further, he was ranked the number-one chemist in the 
151 web-based research evaluation tool, "Essential Science Indicators," with more than 10,000 citations 
to his credit since 1991 (see Exhibit 12 for data on citation frequency).15 He was the author of over 70 
papers that had been referenced more than 100 times each, while his classic article, titled "Formation 
of monolayer films by the spontaneous assembly of organic thiols from solution onto gold" (C.D. 
Bain, et al., Journal of the American Chemistry Society 111(1): 321-335, 1989) had been cited well over 
1,400 times (see Exhibit 13 for Whitesides' most-cited papers published since 1992). As noted by 
Knowles, researchers in the sciences often got cited because they published a paper on an ordinary 
method or technique with widespread use. "Often the citation indices don't quite capture the 
intellectual," he noted, "but if George is the most cited chemist over the last number of years, it is 
because of his breakthrough research. He's not a banal methodologist." 
Whitesides was always furiously busy but never missed his teaching responsibilities, even 
undergraduate lectures. As Knowles noted, "For all his extraordinary range of activities, he is 
absolutely scrupulous about his teaching. He designs new courses, he co-teaches with interesting 
colleagues, and he was an attentive Chair of Department in the late 80s." Knowles continued, 
"George works with enormous penetrating energy. Whenever he says he'll do something, it gets 
done with extreme intelligence and persistence. Whitesides was a strong believer that researchers 
had to answer the big questions in science if they wanted to have an impact in what they did. When 
describing himself and his role in the research lab he was leading, he noted, 
I am part of the research group and certainly a very important part. But there is a lot going 
on in the lab that is very relevant in terms of our creative output in which I'm only facilitating 
and I'm not being the creative center. Students in the lab are young. They have time. They have 
all kinds of motivation. They have great ideas. And setting up the group in such a fashion that 
you take advantage of these enormously smart kids is a conscious effort in the way I run the 
lab. I think my approach is different from what other people do. But, aside from that, it is also 
something anybody can learn to do. 
" The advancement of science was based on critical assessment of the work of others, yet there was an avoidance of value 
judgments such as the statement by Nobel laureate, Julius Axelrod: "Ninety-nine percent of the discoveries are made by one 
percent of the scientists," Proceedings of 11w American Philosophical Society, vol. 149, no. 2, June 2005.
