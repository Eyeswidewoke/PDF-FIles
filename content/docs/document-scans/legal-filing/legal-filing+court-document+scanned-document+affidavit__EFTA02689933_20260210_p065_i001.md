Taxation 
14.13 Emerging marketscountries' tax laws and practices are not always as clearly established as that of the 
European Union. 
Differing interpretations of tax regulations may exist both among and within government ministries 
and organizations at the federal, regional and local levels, creating uncertainties and inconsistent 
enforcement. Furthermore, in the absence of binding precedent or consistent court practice, rulings on 
tax or other related matters by different courts relating to the same and similar circumstances may also 
be inconsistent or contradictory. 
Taxpayers often have to resort to court proceedings to defend their position against the tax authorities. 
Certain events suggest that the tax authorities may be taking a more assertive position in their 
interpretation of the legislation and assessments. 
The abovementioned conditions create tax risks in emerging markets that are more significant than 
typically found in countries with more developed tax systems, imposing additional burdens and costs 
on operations, including management resources. There can be no assurance that current taxes will not 
be increased, that additional tax charges will not be imposed on us or that additional sources of revenue 
or income, or other activities, will not be subject to new taxes, charges or similar fees in the future. In 
addition to substantial tax burden, these risks and uncertainties complicate tax planning and related 
business decisions, potentially exposing to significant fines and penalties and enforcement measures 
despite the best efforts at compliance. [To he confirmed.]

14.14 The volume of new legislation which has appeared in some emerging countries, as well as the 
magnitude of the changes taking place, has resulted in a lack of confidence in the courts to give clear 
and consistent judgements. Legal acts are published by a variety of state bodies and complete 
compliance with legal rules and standards, including in relation to privatisation, has often been 
difficult to achieve even for those attempting to do so. There is also a lack of precedent in relation to 
market-oriented legal relations. Due to the inconsistency of some of the legislation, the same 
provisions of the law may be applied differently by different local authorities and state bodies. The 
uncertainty as to how the law will be applied by different local authorities and state bodies may have 
adverse consequences for the Compartment. Judges and courts are generally inexperienced in the area 
of business and corporate law. Judicial precedents have no binding effect on subsequent decisions a*

most court decisions are not readily available to the public. Enforcement of court judgements can in 
practice be very difficult in many emerging markets countries. All of these factors make judicial 
decisions in emerging markeiscountries difficult to predict and effective redress uncertain. 
Additionally, court judgements are not always enforced or followed by law enforcement agencies. 
Governmental authorities' powers 
14.15 Government authorities have a high degree of discretion in many emerging-markets countries and at 
times exercise their discretion arbitrarily, without hearing or prior notice, and sometimes in a manner 
that is contrary to law. Moreover, the-gesemnimagovcrnments may also hashave the power under 
certain circumstances, by regulation or a government act, to interfere with the performance of, nullify 
or terminate contracts. Governmental actions have included withdrawal of licences, sudden and 
unexpected tax audits, criminal prosecutions and civil actions. Governmental entities have also used 
common defects in matters surrounding share issuances and registration as pretexts for court claims 
and other demands to invalidate such issuances and registrations and/or to void transactions.
