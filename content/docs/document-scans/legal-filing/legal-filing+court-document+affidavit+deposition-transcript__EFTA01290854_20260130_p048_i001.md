have been obtained from independent vendor services, which we believe to be reliable. Market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ from the actual sale price. Securities for which a price is 
not available are marked NW and are omitted from the Total.

The pricing of securities on this statement may vary from their actual liquidation value. Prices shown should only be used as a general guide to portfolio value. Cash shown in this statement may not necessarily 
be available for investment due to unsettled transactions against your account(s). Prices for marketable securities are received from various pricing services thought to be reliable; however, pricing services are 
sometimes unable to provide timely information. Where pricing sources are not readily available, estimated prices may be used. When the updated price is received from the price provider, the updated price will 
be used in the release of the current month's statement Prior statements vii not be revised. You should always request a current valuation for your securities prior to making a financial decision or placing an 
order.

are priced via third party sources believed to be reliable. 
For certain securities, including thinly4raded securities, debt securities in default, securities that do not have a valid pricing source, and certain third-party structured products, the last available pricing will be 
listed. If the last price available for such securities is unchanged for a period of time deemed appropriate for that asset, the current price will purge and NM will be placed in the price field in the statement. The 
pricing of listed options takes into account the last closing price, as well as the current bid and offer prices.
