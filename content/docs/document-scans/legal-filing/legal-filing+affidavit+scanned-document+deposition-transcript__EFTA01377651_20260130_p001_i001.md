S-1/A 
services and our brand more expensive or more difficult. If we are unable to market and promote our brand on third-party platforms 
effectively. our ability to acquire new sellers would be materially harmed. 
We have received a significant amount of media coverage since our formation. We have also been from time to time in the 
past, and may in the future be, the target of incomplete. inaccurate, and misleading or false statements about our company, our 
business, and our products and services that could damage our brand and materially deter people from adopting our services. 
Negative publicity about our company or our management, including about our product quality and reliability, changes to our 
products and services, privacy and security practices, litigation, regulatory enforcement, and other actions, as well as the actions of 
our customers and other users of our services, even if inaccurate, could cause a loss of confidence in us. Our ability to respond to 
negative statements about us may be limited by legal prohibitions on permissible public communications by us during our initial 
public offering process or during future periods. 
We face challenges in expanding into new geographic regions. 
We plan to continue expanding into new geographic regions, and we currently face and will continue to face risks entering 
markets in which we have limited or no experience and in which we may not be well-known. Offering our services in new 
geographic regions often requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and we may not be successful enough in 
these new geographies to recoup our investments in a timely manner or at all. We may be unable to attract a sufficient number of 
sellers. fail to anticipate competitive conditions, or face difficulties in operating effectively in these new markets. 
The expansion of our products and services globally exposes us to risks relating to staffing and managing cross-border 
operations; increased costs and difficulty protecting intellectual property and sensitive data; tariffs and other trade barriers; differing 
and potentially adverse tax consequences: increased and conflicting regulatory compliance requirements, including with respect to 
data privacy and security; lack of acceptance of our products and services; challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural 
differences; exchange rate risk; and political instability. Accordingly, our efforts to expand our global operations may not be 
successful, which could limit our ability to grow our business. 
We rely on third parties and their systems for a variety of services, including to process transaction data and settle funds 
to us and our sellers, and these third parties' failure to perform these services adequately could materially and adversely 
affect our business. 
To provide our payments solution and other products and services, we rely on third parties that we do not control, such as 
the payment card networks, our acquiring processors, the payment card issuers, various financial institution partners, systems like 
the Federal Reserve Automated Clearing House, and other partners. We rely on these third parties for a variety of services, 
including to transmit transaction data, process chargebacks and refunds, settle funds to our sellers, and to provide information and 
other elements of our services. For example, we currently rely on three acquiring

processors in the United States and one in each of Canada and Japan. While we believe there are other acquiring processors that 
could meet our needs, adding or transitioning to new providers may disrupt our business and increase our costs. In the event these 
third parties fail to provide these services adequately, including as a result of errors in their systems or events beyond their control. 
or refuse to provide these services on terms acceptable to us or at all, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives, our 
business may be materially and adversely affected. 
Our services must integrate with a variety of operating systems, and the hardware that enables merchants to accept 
payment cards must interoperate with third-party mobile devices utilizing those operating systems. if we are unable to 
ensure that our services or hardware interoperate with such operating systems and devices, our business may be 
materially and adversely affected. 
We are dependent on the ability of our products and services to integrate with a variety of operating systems, as well as web 
browsers that we do not control. Any changes in these systems that degrade the functionality of our products and services, impose 
additional costs or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive services, including their own services, could 
materially and adversely affect usage of our products and services. In addition, we rely on app marketplaces, such as the Apple 
App Store and Google Play, to drive downloads of our mobile app. Apple, Google, or other operators of app marketplaces regularly 
make changes to their marketplaces, and those changes may make access to our products and services more difficult. In the event 
that it is difficult for our sellers to access and use our products and services, our business may be materially and adversely
