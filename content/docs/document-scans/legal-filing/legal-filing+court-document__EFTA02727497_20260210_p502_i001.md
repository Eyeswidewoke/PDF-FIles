Hyperion Air, LLC S76D38751PAP 
technical support, logistics support, reporting, and other administrative matters pertaining to 
the Helicopter and arising under this Agreement. Customer shall save, indemnify, defend and 
hold harmless Sikorsky and its corporate parents and subsidiaries from and against all claims, 
losses, damages, costs (including legal costs), expenses and liabilities arising from or relating 
to disputes between Customer and Owner pertaining to this Agreement. Upon request, 
Customer shall provide to Sikorsky the Owner's written acknowledgment of the foregoing in 
a form reasonably acceptable to Sikorsky. 
2. Flight Time Reporting — Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month, Customer shall 
e-mail to Sikorsky a statement, signed by Customer, reporting the Component serial numbers 
installed on each Helicopter, the time since new and time since overhaul (if the Component 
was previously overhauled) for each Component, and the total Flight Hours (reporting should 
be to the nearest tenth of an hour) for each Helicopter during the prior month (the "Flight Time 
Report") to fleet_program_finance.gr-sik@lmco.com. 
Customer warrants to Sikorsky that all data reported will be correct, and further agrees to grant 
Sikorsky or its designated representative access to Helicopter records upon reasonable request. 
If the Flight Time Report is not received within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month, 
Sikorsky shall notify Customer of such delinquency. If the Flight Time Report is not received 
within thirty (30) days after providing of such notification, Sikorsky may terminate this 
Agreement or remove the Helicopter from coverage hereunder in accordance with the 
termination provisions of Article V. 
Electronic Flight Time Reports will be updated annually and can be provided to Customer 
upon request, reflecting the Flight Hour Fee for the current calendar year. 
3. Identification and Condition of Components upon Commencement of Agreement — At 
the time of signature of this Agreement or any amendment to this Agreement, for each 
Component installed on a Helicopter, Customer shall identify the serial number and time since 
new and time since overhaul (if the Component was previously overhauled) by completing the 
table set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto. Customer represents and warrants that the 
information contained in Exhibit A attached hereto is correct and that the Components are in 
good working condition with no known defects. Upon request, Customer shall provide copies 
of the Component log cards for Sikorsky's review. Sikorsky may refuse coverage for a 
Component if, in its sole discretion, such Component has not been used or maintained in 
accordance with the terms or conditions of this Agreement or a preceding PAP agreement. 
4. Use, Operation and Maintenance of Components - Customer shall use Components solely 
for the operation of a Helicopter covered under this Agreement. Customer shall obtain 
Sikorsky's written approval prior to removal of a Component from a PAP-covered Helicopter 
and installation of such removed Component into any other helicopter, whether or not such 
helicopter is covered by this Agreement. If Sikorsky discovers that Customer removed a 
Component from a PAP-covered Helicopter and installed such Component on any other 
helicopter without Sikorsky's prior approval, Sikorsky may, in its sole discretion, invoice 
Customer for $5,000.00 USD per occurrence as reimbursement for associated administrative 
costs.
