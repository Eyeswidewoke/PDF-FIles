Cohen showed =e his "Optopatch" machine. It consisted of red and blue =asers, mirrors, lenses, a high-speed digital 
camera, a video projector, a =icroscope and several quiet cooling fans. After he turned it on, a postdoc fellow who =orks 
in his lab, Shan Lou, inserted a petri dish under its microscope. The dish =ontained 11 live neural cells from mice, 
harvested from dorsal-root ganglia, which =elay sensory input to the brain. Lou added a few drops of capsaicin extract, 
=he irritant in pepper spray, and then turned the camera on for 14 seconds. In that =rief period, it snapped 7,000 
frames, totaling 12 gigabytes of data. To =nalyze it, Cohen had written software that searches for patterns by employing 
techniques developed for digital voice and face recognition. "We also use =lgorithms and optical tricks derived from 
astrophysics," Cohen said. Seconds =ater, an analysis appeared on Lou's computer screen. Three of the 11 cells had =een 
identified as firing in response to the capsaicin, indicating that they were =ain-sensing neurons. It would have taken 
Cohen more than a day to record and make sense of =hat cellular information with a patch clamp. This sort of effort was 
a step, =e said, "toward imaging large numbers of neurons in parallel, hundreds, =erhaps thousands." 
Cohen is =ollaborating with Ed Boyden, a professor of neuroscience at M.I.T. and = pioneer in optogenetics, to develop 
the so-called closed-loop implant =nvisioned by Bryan McLaughlin at Draper Labs. Optogenetics, Boyden told me, 
=nables him to "aim light at some subset of cells (without) activating all =he stray cells nearby." 
Opsins might point the way to future treatments for all kinds of diseases, but researchers will most likely have to 
develop bioelectronic devices that =on't use them. Using genetically engineered viruses is going to be tough to get =ast 
the F.D.A. The opsin technique hinges on gene therapy, which has had limited =uccess in clinical trials, is very expensive 
and seems to come with grave =ealth risks. 
Cohen =entions two alternatives. One involves molecules that behave like =psins; another uses RNA that converts into 
an opsinlike protein — =ecause it doesn't

alter DNA, it =oesn't have the risks associated with gene therapy. Neither approach is very far along, however. And "you 
still face the =roblem of getting the light in," he says. Boyden is developing a brain implant with a =uilt-in laser, but 
Cohen believes an external light source is more likely for most =ioelectronics applications. 
Surmounting =hese sorts of technical hurdles "might take 10 years," =amm figures. That seems somewhat optimistic if 
you consider Glaxo's =nvestment so far in bioelectronics. Melinda Stubbee, the company's director of =ommunications, 
says it has spent roughly $60 million in the area, a pittance compared =ith its $6.5 billion in total R. & D. expenditures in 
2013. Slaoui, =efending the number, said, "Funding of R. & D. is like an investment" =94 money only flows toward 
bankable ideas. While he thinks the area shows promise, he seems to want independent researchers to do the legwork 
before Glaxo buys in further. 
At one point, =amm referred to detractors who say bioelectronics is "too =isky, will take too long and is maybe even a 
bit bonkers." In trying =o find some of them, I contacted a number of financial analysts who track Glaxo and the 
pharmaceutical industry. One, Mark Clark, at Deutsche Bank, said to me =n an email: "I know next to nothing about this 
early-stage =echnology! I am prepared to bet you will not find a single Glaxo analyst that knows anything about =his!
