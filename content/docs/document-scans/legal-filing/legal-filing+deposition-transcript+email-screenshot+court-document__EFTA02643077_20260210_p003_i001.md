No need to find any of this painful, and no point in spending time up and back wirh Max. As I explained, none of what 
we're now discussing has anything to do with our decision to move or other major decisions, all being taken on entirely 
different grounds. And no reason for you to be concerned about our financial situation, which is well in hand..<=r> You 
mention other examples. If there are any, I'd of course like to know about them. 
All I knew about, until your last letter, had to do with the interest on the loan. You brought up another matter that I 
didn't know about: DNI payments to me. As I wrote, I would like to know about them, since there is no record in what 
has been sent by Bainco. But that Hs easily cleared up without our wasting any time. 
The only other issue has to do with what the promissory note says about the interest on the loan, again, easily resolved. 
What remains is a passage that we're interpreting somewhat differently, but that too is very easily resolved without any 
meetings: simply have the promissory note rewritten to state explicitly what interest is to be paid when we pay back the 
loan. And that's basically up to you. Nothing else has to be mentioned about non-existent loans. And there's no reason 
f=r any of us to waste precious time simply to resolve matters that are easily settled just by mail. 
With regard to Max, he and I agreed some time ago that he was in a difficul= position representing both Valeria and me 
on the one hand, and the rest of the family on the other. There are no difficulties in that, but it's best to resolve the 
matter cleanly. So we agreed that he wou=d represent the rest of the family while Valeria and I have all of our affair= 
separately, which is how it has been working since. So there's no reason to bring Max into this apart from rewriting the 
promissory note to resolve any ambiguities. 
Again, nothing painful, no reason for concern, what is still unclear has nothing to do with any of our decisions and can 
easily be resolved without difficulty or delay.

What worries us about continuing to try to clear it all up in writing us that it isn't efficient or effective. There's lots of 
time-consumin=, expensive back-and-forth with Max in order for us to give you responses which are obviously not clear 
because they only lead to further questions. What's your objection to a meeting? Cutting out the middle-man/woman 
(us) would almost have to be more effective. At the very worst, it can't hurt, and it could help. We don't understand why
