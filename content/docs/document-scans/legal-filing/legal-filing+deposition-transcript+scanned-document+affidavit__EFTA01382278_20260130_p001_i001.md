issue. In addition, the payment card networks required that forensic investigations be conducted of the intrusions. The forensic firm 
retained by us to conduct an investigation has issued separate reports for each intrusion (copies of which have been provided to the 
payment card networks). In both reports, the forensic firm found that not all of the PCI DSS standards had been met and that some of 
this non-compliance may have contributed to or caused at least some portion of the compromise that occurred during the intrusions. We 
believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us. These claims will likely include amounts for 
incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card reissuance costs) that the payment card 
networks assert they or their issuing banks have incurred. If the payment card networks assert claims against us, we currently intend to 
dispute those claims and assert available defenses. At the present time, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of losses because to 
date no claims have yet been asserted and because significant factual and legal issues remain unresolved. We will continue to evaluate 
information as it becomes known and will record an estimate of loss when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the 
amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. 
There can be no assurance that we will not suffer a similar criminal attack in the future or that unauthorized parties will not gain 
access to personal information of our customers. While we have recently implemented additional security software and hardware 
designed to provide additional protections against unauthorized intrusions, there can be no assurance that unauthorized individuals will 
not discover a means to circumvent our security. Computer intrusions could adversely affect our brands, have caused us to incur legal 
and other fees, may cause us to incur additional expenses for additional security measures and could discourage customers from 
shopping in our stores. 
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to address potential liabilities for workers' compensation, automobile 
and general liability, property risk (including earthquake and flood coverage), director and officers' liability, employment 
practices liability, pharmacy liability and employee health care benefits.

pharmacy liability and employee health care benefits and cyber and terrorism risks. We estimate the liabilities associated with the risks 
retained by us, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
which, by their nature, are subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors 
affecting future inflation rates, discount rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. 
The majority of our workers' compensation liability is from claims occurring in California. California workers' compensation has 
received intense scrutiny from the state's politicians, insurers, employers and providers, as well as the public in general. 
Our long-lived assets, primarily stores, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. 
Our long-lived assets, primarily stores, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Safeway incurred significant impairment 
charges to earnings in the past, including in Safeway's fiscal years ended January 3, 2015, December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012. 
Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at reporting units could result in impairment charges on long-lived assets. 
Our operations are dependent upon the availability of a significant amount of energy and fuel to manufacture, store, transport 
and sell products.
