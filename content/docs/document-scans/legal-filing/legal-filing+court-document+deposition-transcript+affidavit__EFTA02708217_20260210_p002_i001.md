Given that all of us men are going to get prostate cancer at some point but 20% of us 
will die of it, it concentrates the mind and shows the importance of the work we are 
doing in terms of modulating (tuning) the immune system to go from a "bad" 
response to a "good" one. To this end we are considering a trial of precisely this but 
it will take time and funds. 
We have excellent news on the scientific front with several experiments that you 
have helped to fund bearing wonderful fruit. 
The first is a historical review of Professor Dalgleish's vaccae patients with stage 4 
melanoma - there were 71 cases treated by him over the years and of these 20% 
have lived over 15 years - this is unprecedented and were they in a trial rather than 
anecdotal would warrant an immediate licence! Luckily, the obuense cases are 
doing well so we are confident things will work out well in this trial. 
The second is an experiment which has shown that cancer cells behave exactly like 
many parasites and deceive the immune response by the host. This action can be 
reversed by our agent again proving the concept nicely. It is a fabulous piece of work 
and not only gives us a functional marker but it also provides a basis for a biomarker 
in the individual patient. This means we can tailor therapy to an individual patient 
and is something of a Holy Grail in oncology. This work was done using donations by 
you by Dr Androulla Elia at St Georges and she has more exciting data in the pipeline. 
The third study done again at St Georges has shown the effect of our material on 
preventing the development of lung metastases (spread of the cancer) in a mouse 
model using colon cancer cells. Again, a lovely experiment and very good data to 
confirm the observations from Dr Hagemann in a separate laboratory - see below. 
The fourth and fifth studies involve the development of a proteomic chip (this is a 
laboratory on a chip model) with a Californian group which is another and perhaps 
even more set of important biomarkers - we hope to validate these results by the 
end of the year. These data are even better than the prostate genomics I mentioned 
earlier. 
The other work in collaboration with Dr Thorsten Hagemann at Baits is also nearing 
completion as are experiments we have commissioned elsewhere on the induction of 
immunogenic cell death - this is where we damage a cancer to release antigens so 
that the immune system can "see" it and attack. The key is to unmask the tumour 
which, like a parasite, hides itself from recognition. 
Finally, we are also anticipating some nice data from Professor Bahr at Balamand -
he has been a valued partner and his work on isolated dendritic cells (the watchdog 
of the immune system) is going well and will provide yet another predictive marker. 
All these have added huge steps in the understanding of mechanisms as we build our 
hypotheses relating to mode of action and outcome and are providing a way of 
tailoring the treatment to an individual patient. 
On the clinical side, we have more data from the phase 1 study on the end stage 
melanoma patients that show good news. 12 of 18 survivors are now in the ongoing 
long-term follow-up trial and are doing well and now into their third year of
