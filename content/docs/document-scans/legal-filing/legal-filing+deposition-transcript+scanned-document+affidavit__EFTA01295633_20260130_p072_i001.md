785 F.3d 895, "; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
431 U.S. at 339, providing "texture" for statistical evidence. Robinson v. Metro-North 
Commuter R.R. Co., 267 F.3d 147, 168 (2d Cir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds by 
Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2560-62. But standing alone, "anecdotal evidence . . . [will] rarely, 
if ever, . . . show a systemic pattern of discrimination." O'Donnell Constr. Co. v. Dist. of 
Columbia, 963 F.2d 420, 427, 295 U.S. App. D.C. 317 (D.C. Cir. 1992); accord Briggs v. 
Anderson, 796 F.2d 1009, 1019 (8th Cir. 1986) (observing that plaintiffs "punished 
themselves" by choosing to rely on anecdotal evidence); EEOC v. Bloomberg L.P., 778 F. 
Supp. 2d 458, 470-71 & n.8 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (collecting cases); see also Michael Selmi, 
Theorizing Systemic Disparate Treatment Law: After Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 32 Berkeley J. 
Emp. & Lab. L. 477, 501 (2011) ("[A]necdotal evidence is always of marginal significance 
in a pattern or practice claim."). 
In discrimination cases, courts move anecdotal evidence to the background because such 
evidence does not prove much. "Anecdotal reports . . . are ordinarily more helpful in 
generating lines of inquiry than in proving causation." Federal Judicial Center, Reference 
Manual on Scientific Evidence 217 (2011). Individual stories say little, for instance, about 
the frequency of an event's occurrence or the reasons for that occurrence. Without 
knowing at least those two items, it can hardly be assumed that the stories reflect a 
broader trend flowing directly from intentional discrimination. See Wessmann v. Gittens, 
160 F.3d 790, 805-06 (1st Cir. 1998); Coral Constr. Co. v. King Cnty., 941 F.2d 910, 919 
(9th Cir. 1991). Anecdotes are also more susceptible to mistaken perception, leading to 
erroneous conclusions r135] -- especially when collections of stories are treated as 
quasi-statistics. See Fisher v. Vassar Coll., 70 F.3d 1420, 1444-45 (2d Cir. 1995). And bias 
can skew anecdotal evidence, as when only those who feel most strongly about an issue 
offer anecdotes or when the soliciting party has a particular objective in mind. Cf. United 
States v. Local 560 of Intl Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, & Helpers of 
Am., 780 F.2d 267, 277 (3d Cir. 1985) (finding that a survey that was meant to show the 
"reputation" of a particular organization should have been excluded when it only surveyed 
persons known "to be hostile" to the organization). Because "anecdotes provide no 
mechanism for assessing truthfulness, typicality, or frequency," courts can and should 
question their usefulness, just as "[s]cientists and medical researchers" have done for 
many years. David A. Hyman, Lies, Damned Lies, and Narrative, 73 Ind. L. J. 797, 803 
(1998). 
2. 
The majority finds Plaintiffs' anecdotal evidence sufficient principally because the ratio 
reflecting the number of affidavits alleging discrimination compared to the number of class 
members is purportedly r949i small. Maj. op. at 40-41. As of 2006, Plaintiffs' experts 
determined that "approximately 150 African-Americans" comprised the class. J.A. 1154. 
Given that the class period extends well into 2011, it is reasonable to assume that Nucor 
hired additional black applicants since 2006, conservatively r136] setting the present 
class size at 160 black employees or more. The sixteen affidavits that Plaintiffs provide 
therefore represent roughly one affidavit for every ten class members -- a weak sample 
from the entire class. "[A] court must be wary of a claim that the true color of a forest is 
better revealed by reptiles hidden in the weeds than by the foliage of countless free-
standing trees." Cooper, 467 U.S. at 879-80. When ten percent of a class (or less)
