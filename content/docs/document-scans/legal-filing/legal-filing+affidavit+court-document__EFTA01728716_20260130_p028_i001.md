toms does not prove that a child was sexually victimized, the absence of them 
does not prove that a child was not. 
The use of expert witnesses to introduce this evidence into a court of law is a 
complex legal issue that will also not be discussed here in detail (but see Myers & 
Stern, 2002). Mental-health professionals, social workers, child-protective ser-
vice-workers, and law-enforcement investigators can be the source of such 
expert testimony regarding symptoms of sexual victimization. Experts might 
not be allowed to testify about the guilt and innocence of the accused but might 
be able to testify about the apparent validity of a case by explaining or offering 
opinions about the nature of the offense and its consistency with documented 
cases and offender/victim patterns of behavior. One commonly accepted use of 
such expert testimony is to impeach defense experts and rehabilitate prosecution 
witnesses after their credibility has been attacked by the defense. An expert might 
be able to testify concerning such symptoms to rebut defense allegations that 
the prosecution has no evidence other than the testimony of a child victim or 
child's disclosure is totally the result of leading and improper questioning. 
These and other possible uses of expert testimony should be discussed with 
the prosecutor of each case. Even if not admissible in court, the symptoms of 
sexual victimization still can be useful as part of investigative corroboration, par-
ticularly when symptoms predate any disclosure. Ongoing research reveals that 
sexually abused girls also may experience physiological changes and symptoms 
(DeBellis, Lefter, Trickett, & Putnam, 1994). The investigative and prosecutive 
significance of these findings is unknown at this time. 
Document Patterns of Behavior 
Two patterns of behavior should be documented. They are victim and offender 
patterns. 
Victim Patterns By far the most important victim pattern of behavior to identify 
and document is the disclosure process. Investigators must verify, through active 
investigation, the exact nature and content of each disclosure, outcry, or state-
ment made by the victim. Secondhand information about disclosure is not good 
enough. To whatever extent humanly possible the investigator should determine 
exactly when, where, to whom, in precisely what words, and why the victim 
disclosed. 
It can be important to determine why the child did not disclose sooner and 
why the child did disclose now. A well-documented, convincing disclosure, espe-
cially a spontaneous one with no secondary gain, can be corroborative evidence. 
The fact that a victim does not disclose the abuse for years or recants previous 
disclosures might be part of a pattern of behavior that in fact helps to corroborate 
sexual victimization. The documentation of the secrecy, the sequence of disclo-
sures, the recantation of statements, and the distortion of events can all be part of 
the corroboration process. 
More specific behavior patterns of seduced or cooperating victims are 
described in greater detail in the chapter titled "Acquaintance-Exploitation Cases" 
beginning on page 47. 
Offender Patterns Documenting offender patterns of behavior is one of the most 
important and overlooked steps in the corroboration process. Investigators must
