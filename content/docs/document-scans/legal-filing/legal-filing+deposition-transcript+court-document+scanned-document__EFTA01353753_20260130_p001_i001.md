(3) 
the amount of the Management Fee that would have been payable in respect of 
such Additional Limited Partner, had such Additional Limited Partner 
subscribed for such interest at the Initial Closing; and 
(4) 
at the General Partner's option, an interest-equivalent amount equal to the 
interest that would be payable on a debt obligation in the amount of the 
contribution made pursuant to (2) and (3), computed at a rate per annum equal 
to the higher of (A) LIBOR plus 2% and (B) 8% for the period from the due 
date or dates on which the other Partners were required to make their earlier 
contributions to the date of such contribution. 
(b) 
Any Additional Limited Partners admitted after the final closing date of the Underlying 
Fund shall contribute, on or after the day of its admission or acceptance of its additional 
Subscription, (i) its proportionate sham of funded Subscriptions of Limited Partners 
(other than Defaulting Partners) admitted in prior closings (including in respect of 
Partnership Expenses other than Management Fees) and (ii) the amount of the 
Management Fee that would have been payable in respect of such Additional Limited

their earlier contributions to the date of such contribution.

Any amounts contributed pursuant to 3.3.1(a)(3) or 3.3.1(b)(ii), including any interest 
thereon shall be paid to the Investment Manager. Other amounts shall be subject to 
adjustment as provided in 6.2.2 and shall be invested in the Underb ing Fund or paid to

of existing Limited Partners (including any Feeder Fund and indirectly, limited partners 
of any such Feeder Fund), provided that any amounts which constitute interest paid to 
existing Limited Partners shall not increase such Limited Partners' unpaid Subscriptions. 
For the avoidance of doubt, investments of the Underlying Fund made and disposed of

admitted at such subsequent closing and the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, 
make any allocations or adjustments necessary to give effect to this provision.

look-through basis, as if such limited partners had a direct interest in the Partnership or 
were subscribing for a direct interest in the Partnership (or to increase its Subscription to 
the Partnership), and the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, adjust the Capital 
Accounts, Contributions, payments and distributions of and to the Limited Partners 
(including a Feeder Fund) in order to give effect to the foregoing and to the provisions of 
any limited partnership agreement of a Feeder Fund.
