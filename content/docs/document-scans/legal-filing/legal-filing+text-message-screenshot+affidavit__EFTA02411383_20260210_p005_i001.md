each government will have to find its own way of reducing the burden. The battle between borrowers and 
creditors may be the defining struggle of the next generation. 
The morning after 
A $3 trillion consumer hangover 
Jun 24th 2010 
IN THE autumn of 2009 Jonathan Mitchell, a British software developer, realised he had a problem. He had been 
running up his credit-card bills for years after his partner got sick and was unable to work. He ended up owing 
£30,000. "You think if they are going to give it to me, I must be able to afford it," he recalls. 
Mr Mitchell tackled his problem before the bailiffs arrived. He took advice and applied for an IVA (individual 
voluntary arrangement), a British scheme that allows the borrower to negotiate a plan for dealing with his debts. 
After allowing for essential spending, he now pays £280 a month to his creditors. If his house rises in value over 
the next five years, he will have to take out a further mortgage to pay back other creditors. But his life is not too 
constrained: he still has a mobile phone and satellite TV. 
Mr Mitchell is one of millions of consumers across the developed world who are struggling to deal with their debts 
in reduced economic circumstances. By the standards of past centuries he has got off lightly. A failure to repay 
debts was once seen as a sign of moral laxity. Nowadays it is the lender as much as the borrower who is perceived 
to be at fault for extending credit to those who should never have been granted it. 
The idea that debt is a shameful state to be avoided has been steadily eroding since the 1960s, when a 
generation whose first memories were of the Depression was superseded by one brought up during the 1950s 
consumer boom. People were already used to buying houses and motor cars on credit, but suddenly a whole range 
of durable goods—TVs, fridges, washing machines—could be had on easy terms. Credit cards and charge cards 
came into widespread use. Buyers no longer had to scrimp and save to get what they wanted; they could have it 
now. As the range of desirable products grew, from Nintendo Wiis to iPhones, the urge to buy first and find the 
money later increased. "Consumers' attitudes have changed incredibly over the past 15 years," says Steve Rees of 
Vincent Bond, a debt-management agency. "They have gone from aspiring to be just above their pay bracket to 
aiming a long way above their pay bracket." 
All this meant that growth in consumer credit regularly outstripped growth in GDP in the Anglo-Saxon countries 
and saving ratios fell to historic lows. At the end of the second world war in 1945 consumer credit in America 
totalled just under $5.7 billion; ten years later it had already grown to nearly $43 billion, and the party was just 
getting started. It reached $100 billion in 1966, $500 billion in 1984 and $1 trillion in 1994, or around $4,000 for 
every man, woman and child. The peak, so far, was almost $2.6 trillion in July 2008. Household debt approached 
100% of GDP in 2007, a level seen only once before, rather ominously in 1929.
