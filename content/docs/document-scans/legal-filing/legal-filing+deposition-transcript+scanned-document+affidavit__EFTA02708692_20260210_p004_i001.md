Barack Obama =nd Iraq: Cool calculations 
Jun 13th 2014 -- Av=iding aggressive questions is a hallmark of the White House press corps. S= it should be no surprise 
that reporters watching President Barack Obama m=ke an emergency statement on Iraq on June 13th failed to pelt him 
with the queries that lurk at the centre=of the debate over America's role in the Middle East. Namely: Mr Preside=t, did 
you help to bring these horrors about when you rushed to pull Ameri=an combat troops out of Iraq as quickly as 
possible? And, Mr President, does any part of you regret ignoring pleas=to arm and train non-extreme opposition forces 
across the border in Syria =ver the past two years? 
Instead reporters a=lowed Mr Obama to explain why American involvement in Iraq would be limite=, would take 
"several days" to be sent, would not involve any return o= ground troops and was conditional on Iraq's central 
government coming up with a "sincere" political plan to resolv= sectarian divisions. "We can't do it for them," Mr 
Obama said sever=ly. 
"Nobody has an=interest in seeing terrorists gain a foothold inside of Iraq and nobody is=going to benefit from seeing 
Iraq descend into chaos. The United States wi=1 do our part," he added. "But understand that ultimately it's up to the 
Iraqis, as a sovereign nation, to solve the=r problems." 
Yet is that enough?=Does such cool rationality from the global policeman make the world more d=ngerous? The 
question of Mr Obama's caution and hyper-realism (some woul= say cynicism) underpins everything. Foes and friends 
listen to Mr Obama. Then they then watch violent men harn=ss ethnic, sectarian and nationalist hatreds to challenge the 
internationa= order, seemingly with impunity. Finally, enemies and allies alike wonder:=does the world feel this volatile 
because Mr Obama has signalled America is so reluctant to intervene? =/span> 
But nobody asked Mr=Obama whether what is happening in Iraq or Syria is his fault, in any way.=As the president stood 
in the summer sunshine, his Marine One helicopter v=sible behind him, waiting to carry him to a speech about 
education and poverty-reduction on a Sioux reservati=n in North Dakota, reporters instead asked him to analyse the 
situation.&n=sp; 
Which he did. The p=esident is an intelligent, rational and rigorous observer of global horror=. And he is often eloquent 
in his assessment of why it is folly to think s=ch problems can be easily or reliably solved by military means alone. Asked 
about the sight of Iraqi army =nits abandoning their posts in the face of smaller enemy forces, Mr Obama =ade a good 
point. If Iraqi troops were not "willing to stand and figh=" against the militant attackers, that points to a "problem in 
terms of morale" and commitment that reflects p=litical divisions in the country. He expressed fears of worsening 
violence=should Sunni insurgents overrun Shiite sacred sites in the country. 
His observations we=e sound. And here is the frustrating thing about reporting on this preside=t's worldview. In and of 
itself, his cool, cerebral analysis is often mo=e rational and less hypocritical than the criticism raining down on him from 
his political opponents. 
Republicans in Wash=ngton, knowing full well that voters have precisely no appetite for a retu=n to Iraq, content 
themselves with accusing the president of allowing the =orld to fall apart and emboldening wicked men and dangerous 
foes through a lack of attention and "weakness=94. By this they seem to mean that Mr Obama should stop saying that 
Americ=n force may not be capable of fixing the world. They do not mean that they=actually want Mr Obama to do 
anything with American force. 
Thus the most senio= elected Republican in Washington, the Speaker of the House of Representat=ves John Boehner, 
criticised the president on June 12thfor watching terror=sts seize growing swathes of Iraq, adding: "And what is the 
president doing? Taking a nap!" <=p>
