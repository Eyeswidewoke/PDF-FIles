(d) Multiemployer Pension Plans 
Multiemployer Pension Plans 
NAI contributes to various multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements, primarily defined benefit pension 
plans. These multiemployer plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. 
The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Plan trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of 
benefits to be provided to participants as well as the investment of the assets and plan administration. Trustees are appointed in equal 
number by employers and unions that are parties to the collective bargaining agreement. Expense is recognized in connection with these 
plans as contributions are funded, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from the risks associated with single-employer plans in the 
following respects: 
a. 
Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating 
employers. 
b. 
If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining 
participating employers. 
c. 
If NAI chooses to stop participating in some multiemployer plans, or makes market exits or store closures or otherwise has 
participation in the plan drop below certain levels, NAI may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded 
status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. 
NAI's participation in these plans is outlined in the table below. The EIN-Pension Plan Number column provides the Employer 
Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number, if applicable. Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Protection 
Act zone status (PPA) available in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 relates to the plans' two most recent fiscal year-ends. The zone status is 
based on information that Parent received from the plan and is certified by each plan's actuary. The FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented 
column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been 
implemented by the trustees of each plan. 
Certain plans have been aggregated in the All Other Multiemployer Pension Plans line in the following table, as the contributions to 
each of these plans are not individually material. None of NAI's collective bargaining agreements require that a minimum contribution be 
made to these plans. Finally, the number of employees covered by NAI's multiemployer plans decreased by 14% from fiscal 2011 to 
fiscal 2012 and by eight percent from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011, affecting the period-to-period comparability of the contributions for fiscal 
years 2012, 2011 and 2010. The reduction in covered employees corresponded to store closures and reductions in headcount.
