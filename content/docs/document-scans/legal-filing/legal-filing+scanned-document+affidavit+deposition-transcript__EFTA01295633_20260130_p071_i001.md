Not even Plaintiffs' statistical experts attempt to tie their disparities to a dual-approval 
policy. 
The majority surmises that a discriminatory supervisor in one department could have 
theoretically used dual approval to inflict his animus upon employees outside his own 
department. But if a racist department head had tried to use the dual-approval scheme to 
disadvantage black workers, he would not have been able to reach all or even most of the 
promotions decisions in the plant, dual approval notwithstanding. A discriminatory ("132] 
department head in the beam mill, for instance, would have had no say when it came to a 
cold mill employee seeking a higher position within the cold mill, hot mill, melt shop, 
maintenance department, or shipping department. Perhaps, then, the majority's concept --
if properly supported with evidence -- might justify a class of persons applying in and out of 
a particularly problematic department. In fact, the district court proposed certifying just 
such a class as to the beam mill. See J.A. 10953-54 & n.16. But it would not justify the 
plant-wide class action that Plaintiffs now mean to bring. Cf. Ellis, 657 F.3d at 983 ("A 
disparity in only 25% of the regions, however, would not show that discrimination 
manifested in promotions practices in the same general fashion.").

In sum, the district court did not clearly err in choosing not to rely on Plaintiffs' statistical 
evidence. Faced with evidence based on questionable data, uncontrolled explanatory 
variables, and poorly structured methodologies, the district court did not act irrationally in 
determining that such evidence was of negligible credence. The "troubling effects of 
statistical inferences require thoughtful consideration in each case," Mister v. III. Cent. Gulf 
R.R. Co., 832 F.2d 1427, 1437 (7th Cir. 1987), and ("133] that consideration is sorely 
lacking from the work of Plaintiffs' experts. Thus, Plaintiffs' evidence, with its many 
deficiencies, does not establish the common policy necessary for class certification. The 
district court did not abuse its discretion in making that finding. 
B. Anecdotal Evidence 
Plaintiffs also present affidavits from sixteen employees in support of certifying the 
promotions classes. The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to certify 
Plaintiffs' proposed class based on this limited evidence. 
[*948] 1. 
In their original class certification motion, Plaintiffs never argued that anecdotal evidence, 
standing alone, could establish a common policy of discrimination. Rather, Plaintiffs 
presented the anecdotal evidence only to supplement their statistical evidence. See Brown 
I, 576 F.3d at 164 (Agee, J., dissenting). The Brown I majority constructed its own theory 
of the case, finding that Plaintiffs could in fact advance their case on anecdotal evidence 
"alone." Id. at 153. Plaintiffs now take up the Brown I majority's theory in this appeal. 
Plaintiffs made the better choice in their initial offering, as anecdotes only help tell the 
story. They are meant to bring "the cold numbers convincingly ("134] to life," Teamsters,
