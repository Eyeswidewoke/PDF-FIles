Results 
No difference in the =ompliance of programmes was detected, and 78% of participants completed =he exercise 
programmes. In the WBV group, the mean frequency of =ttendance was 2.7 (SD 0.7) times per week, and no vibration-
related =ide-effect or any adverse reaction was observed. In the Walking group, =he mean attendance was 2.8(SD 0.8) 
days per week. 
The baseline characteristics =f both groups are given in Table Table1.1. The groups were matched by age and 
=eight, which are major determinant anthropometric variables on the =train in WBV training. However, the WBV group 
had a trend (p > .200) =f higher weight and BMI than the walking group. Table Table22 also shows some imbalances 
=etween the groups, so the changes were analysed by adjusting baseline =ata and age. After 8 months, the BMD at the 
femoral neck of the WBV =roup was increased 4.3% (P = 0.011) compared =o the Walking group. The comparison of the 
changes in BMD at other =ices on the hip showed a trend for the higher effectiveness of the =ibratory exercise, but the 
difference did not reach statistical =ignificance. In contrast, BMD at the lumbar spine was unaltered in both =roups. The 
WBV group showed improved balance (29%), while the Walking =roup did not. The WBV group reduced more the BMI 
than the Walking group =3%; P = 0.049).

The lateral acceleration received by the WBV group at =he lumbar spine (L3) (median 3.3 g, SD 1.3; maximal 11.6 
g, SD 6.5) was =reater (P < 0.001) than the vertical =cceleration (median: 0.7 g, SD 0.5; maximal 6.4, SD =.6).

Discussion 
Summary of main findings 
The main finding of the study was that the =ibratory exercise on a reciprocating plate was more effective than 
=alking for improving balance and BMD at the femoral neck. The =daptation of bone to physical activity and mechanical 
loading is =rucial to the improvement and/or maintenance of bone mass and =trength[18,231. =ccording to conventional 
wisdom, the stimulus should be different from =hat usually occurs in daily living to stimulate an adaptation of the =one 
tissue[24). =owever, recent studies suggested that extremely low magnitude but =igh-frequency mechanical vibration 
can strongly influence bone =orphology[13,25I =ecause of the reverberation. Lodder et al. [26] =alculated that with 
increasing age, BMD in women decreases 0.005 =/cm2 per year at femoral neck (95% CI, 0.001 to =.006 decreases) and 
0.006 g/cm2 per year at lumbar spine (95% CI, =.00 to 0.007 decreases) excluding the influence of corticosteroid use. 
=herefore, preventing bone loss is a clinically relevant effect. The =urrent study showed a significantly (P = =.011) and 
clinically relevant mean effect preventing bone loss at =emoral neck (0.02 g/cm2 increase) but the mean effect at 
lumbar spine =0.01 g/cm2 decrease) was not clinically relevant. More in =etail, seven participants in the vibratory group 
and three in the =alking group prevented bone mass density loss (no change or improvement =n BMD) at femoral neck. 
A similar trend of the number of preventions =as observed at the lumbar spine, but the mean of improvements were 
=ower. In a whole, walking program did not prevent bone loss. The other =ositive finding of the current vibrating 
training programme was the =igh frequency of attendance at sessions (90%) of the participants who =ompleted the 
programme. The profile of the sample (highly sedentary =ostmenopausal women) showing retention of the current 
programmes (78%) =s similar but slightly lower than that of previous community =roup-based strategies to promote 
exercise in the elderly population =80-90%)[27J. =owever, strategies to improve retention of the programme should be 
=ursued (musical environment, behavioural education, =tc.).
