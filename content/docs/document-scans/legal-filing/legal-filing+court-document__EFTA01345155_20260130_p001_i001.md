Deutsche Bank 
Wealth Management 
Certification Regarding Beneficial Owners Of Legal 
Entity Customers 
I. General instructions 
What is this form? 
To help the government fight financial crime, Federal regulation requires certain financial institutions to obtain, verify, 
and record information about the beneficial owners of legal entity customers. Legal entities can be abused to disguise 
involvement in terrorist financing, money laundering, tax evasion, corruption, fraud, and other financial crimes. Requiring the 
disclosure of key individuals who own or control a legal entity (i.e., the beneficial owners) helps law enforcement investigate 
and prosecute these crimes. 
Who has to complete this form? 
This form must be completed by the person opening a new account on behalt of a legal entity with any of the following U.S. 
financial institutions: (i) a bank or credit union; (ii) a broker or dealer in securities; (iii) a mutual fund; (iv) a futures commission 
merchant or (v) an introducing broker in commodities. 
For the purposes of this form, a legal entity includes a corporation, limited liability company, or other entity that is created 
by a filing of a public document with a Secretary of State or similar office, a general partnership, and any similar business 
entity formed in the United States or a foreign country. Legal entity does not include sole proprietorships, unincorporated 
associations, or natural persons opening accounts on their own behalf. 
What information do I have to provide? 
This form requires you to provide the name, address, date of birth and Social Security number (or passport number or other 
similar information, in the case of Non-U.S. Persons) for the following individuals (i.e., the beneficial owners): 
• Each individual, if any, who owns, directly or indirectly, 25 percent or mare of the equity interests ofthe legal entity customer 
(e.g.. each natural person that owns 25 percent or more of the shares of a corporation); and 
• An individual with significant responsibility for managing the legal entity customer (e.g., a Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Managing Member, General Partner, President, Vice President, or Treasurer). 
The number of individuals that satisfy this definition of -beneficial owner" may vary. Under section (i), depending on the 
factual circumstances, up to four individuals (but as few as zero) may need to be identified. Regard€ess of the number 
of individuals identified under section (i), you must provide the identifying information of one individual under section 
(ii). It is possible that in some circumstances the same individual might he identified under both sections (e.g., the President 
of Acme, Inc. who also holds a 30% equity interest). Thus, a completed form will contain the identifying information of at least 
one individual (under section (ii)), and up to five individuals (i.e., one individual under section (ii) and four 25 percent equity 
holders under section (i)). 
The financial institution may also ask to see a copy of a driver's license or other identifying document for each beneficial 
owner listed on this form.
