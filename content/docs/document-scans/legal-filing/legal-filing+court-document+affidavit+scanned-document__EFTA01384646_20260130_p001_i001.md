HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Fund may be materially affected by the actions of larger Feeder Funds investing in the Master 
Fund. For example, if a larger Feeder Fund redeems from the Master Fund, the remaining Feeder 
Funds may experience higher 
rata operating expenses, thereby producing lower returns. The 
Master Fund may become less diverse due to a redemption by a larger Feeder Fund, resulting in 
increased portfolio risk. The Master Fund is a single entity and creditors of the Master Fund may 
enforce claims against all assets of the Master Fund. 
While the Management Company generally will not consider tax issues applicable to any 
particular investors, it generally will take into account the tax positions of the Partnership and the 
other Feeder Funds that invest in the Master Fund. However, the current structure through which 
the Partnership invests may create a conflict of interest in that different tax considerations for the 
Partnership and the other Feeder Funds may cause or result in the Master Fund structuring or 
disposing of investments in a manner or at a time that is more advantageous (or disadvantageous) 
for tax purposes to one Feeder Fund or its investors. 
Levered Feeder Funds 
As described above, the Levered Fund operates like the Offshore Fund by investing all of 
its investable assets in the Master Fund through the Intermediate Fund, but on a levered basis by 
employing leverage at the Levered Fund level. The Management Company may, in the future, 
establish additional Feeder Funds that have different terms (including more favorable terms) than 
those with respect to the Partnership and the Levered Fund, including one or more Feeder Funds 
whose investments are more or less leveraged than existing Feeder Funds, including the 
Partnership (each such fund, along with its subsidiaries, a "Levered Feeder Fund"). In connection 
with structuring these investments, a Levered Feeder Fund may pledge its interests in other funds 
including the Underlying Funds to lenders or an Underlying Fund may provide a guarantee secured 
by the assets of an Underlying Fund limited to the value of the Levered Feeder Fund's investment 
in the Underlying Fund. Guarantees provided by an Underlying Fund may limit or reduce the 
amount of leverage available to an Underlying Fund, as an Underlying Fund may choose or be 
required to custody or segregate a certain amount of its assets with a financing counterparty thereby 
reducing collateral available for an Underlying Fund. Further, the financing counterparty may 
aggregate the financing provided to the Guaranteed Entity together with the financing provided to 
an Underlying Fund directly, and establish a single financing limit for the total collateral posted 
by an Underlying Fund on its own behalf and on behalf of the Levered Feeder Fund. To that effect, 
in connection with the Levered Fund's retention of leverage, the Levered Fund has pledged all of 
its assets, including its interests in the Intermediate Fund, to the Lender and the Intermediate Fund 
has, in turn, guaranteed the Levered Fund's obligations to the Lender and pledged all of its assets, 
including its interests in the Master Fund (limited to the amount of the Levered Fund's interests in 
the Intermediate Fund) to the Lender. 
As part of this structure, the Levered Feeder Fund (and, in turn, the lenders upon 
foreclosure) would be entitled to more favorable withdrawal, redemption, transfer and/or 
liquidation and other rights under certain circumstances, which may increase the risk of 
withdrawals or redemptions (and result in withdrawals or redemptions at times when other 
investors in a Feeder Fund are unable to effect withdrawals or redemptions), particularly if there 
are specified declines in the net asset value of the Levered Feeder Fund or an Underlying Fund or 
a termination of the financial arrangement with a lender due to the occurrence of events of default
