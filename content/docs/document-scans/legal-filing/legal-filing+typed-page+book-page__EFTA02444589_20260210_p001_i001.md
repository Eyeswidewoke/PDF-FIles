Sustainability and Energy 
PERSPECTIVE 
Don't Forget Long-Term Fundamental 
Research in Energy 
George M. Whitesides" and George W. Crabtree/
Achieving a fundamental understanding of the phenomena that will underpin both global 
stewardship and future technologies in energy calls for a thoughtful balance between large-scale 
immediate solutions using existing technology and the fundamental research needed to provide 
better solutions in the 50-year period. 
E
nimy and limate change are now pre-
occupations shared by science. engineer-
ing and society. There is a range of views 
on energy and almost religious levels of advo-
cacy for particular technologies. There is also 
surprisingly broad (although not universal) agree-
ment that there is no single solution to the dual 
problems of meeting future demands for energy 
and managing the environmental consequences 
of energy production. Whatever strategy emerges 
will be a quilt made up of patches representing 
almost every imaginable technology. 
The energy problem is often phrasal in terms 
of developing a strategy that roughly doubles the 
global production of energy by 2050 (from 13 to 
about 30 terawatts) (Fig. I) (1-9). The problem 
of climate change includes two especially 
important components: (i) understanding the 
relationship between the climate and the chem-
ist*, of the atmosphere and oceans and (ii) 
predicting the impact on climate of different 
strategies for energy production. Because at-
mospheric C'0, is the dominant greenhouse 
gas. and because coal is the carbon-rich fossil 
fuel whose use can most readily be expanded 
(especially in the rapidly growing economy of 
China). understanding the linkage between coal 
and climate is particularly important 16). 
There is a pervasive sense that "We must do 
something soon." This urgency mny be justified. 
but we must also remember that the problems of 
providing energy and maintaining the environ-
ment arc not about to go away, no matter how 
hard we try using current technologies. In the 
rush to do something to find technological 
solutions to global-scale problems—we should 
not forget that we must ultimately understand 
than if we are to find the most effective, a:s-
tainable solutions. Fundamental research in sci-
ence and engineering is important. Understanding 
phenomena relevant to energy and the environ-
ment leads to new technologies and to the ability

to control the avnomic and environmental out-
comes of their applications (7). 
The cost of large technology demonstra-
tion projects is enormous and the time to de-
velop them decades, and it is easy to overlook 
the fundamental research that nourishes them. 
Today, we have a growing thicket of energy 
and environmental problems and great enthu-
siasm for solving them quickly. In fact. 50 
years from now, most of these problems (and 
more) will still remain unsolved. Developing 
the best patches we can for the immediate 
problems is one approach. Understanding the 
underlying problems is another, and one that 
is at least as important, much less expensive, 
and perhaps ultimately time-saving. Energy 
and climate are problems that will extend over 
decades or centuries, and the unimaginable 
technologies of 100 years from now will reit 
on fundamental research that must start now. 
What follows is a sketch of nine represent-
ative long-tem problems in research that are 
vital to the development of future technology 
for energy. We emphasize that this list is per-
sonal and idiosyncratic; it tends to emphasize 
materials. Others might select differently, al-
though most lists would probably have areas 
of broad overlap. 
The Oxygen Electrode Problem 
A hydrogen fuel cell operates by extracting eke-
trons from i12 and transferring them through 
an external circuit to 0 2 (to generate I-120). If 
the H2 is generated electrochemically, the re-
verse reactions take place. In either event, the 
transfer of electrons from H2O to one elec-
trode and to 0 2 from another arc slow reac-
tions and lower the efficiency of practical fuel 
cells (considering the free energy of the reac-
tions involved). The slow rates of interconversion 
of 4 e + 02 + 4 W and 2 H,0 exemplify a 
broader clam of reactions in which a single 
process requires the transfer of multiple elec-
trons. Understanding these reactions and find-
ing strategies for circumventing their limitations 
arc important in developing new, more prac-
tical procedures for reactions ranging from the 
electrochemical production of H2 and the use 
of 0 2 in fuel cells to the reduction of nitrogen 
to ammonia. 
Catalysis by Design 
Many of the reactions that occur in the pro-
duction of energy involve catalysis: the full set 
used in the processing of crude oil to fucks; all 
of the biological reactions involved in photo-
synthesis, in fixing CO,, and in biodegrada-
tion; the hydration of CO, to carbonate ion: the 
movement of electrons in batteries: the opera-
tion of fuel cells: the cleanup of exhaust gas 
from internal combustion engines: and many 
others. Given the enormous importance of ca-
talysis in the production and storage of energy. 
in the production of petrochemicals and the ma-
tenals derived from them, and in all biological 
and most geochemical processes it is astonish- 
ing (and a little disheartening) how little is 
known of the fundamentals of catalysis: how 
catalysts operate, how to control them, and es-
pecially how to generate new ones. Catalysis by 
design has periodically been embraced as a 
grand challenge, and periodically abandoned as 
too difficult, but nanoseicncc and surface sci-
ence offer new approaches to this problem. The 
fundamental study of catalysis roust be re-
animates! across the full spectrum of processes 
involved in energy and the environment. 
Transport of Charge and Excitation 
Pholoexcitation of the semiconductor or dye 
component of a solar cell creates an exciton: a 
separated but associated hole and electron (4, 5). 
To generate current the electron must move to 
one electrode, and the hole to the otha, before 
they combine. These processes arc inefficient in 
materials that might make inexpensive photo-
cells: defective. polyclystalline, disordered, or 
quantum-dot semiconductors (whether inorganic 
or organic). Understanding them and circum-
venting their deficiencies is one key to cost-
effective solar cells. 
Chemistry of CO2
CO2 is a key molecule in global warming (6). 
in chemical and biological fuel production, and 
in fuel use. We must know everything possible 
about its physical and chemical interactions. 
Important topics include new uses of CO, in 
large-scale chemistry (where it has the attractive 
feature that it has negative cast), new chemical 
reactions of CO2. the movement and reactions of 
CO2 in the earth, the role of CO2 in determining 
the behavior of the atmosphere and oceans. 
and the chemistry and properties of CO2 at high 
pressures. For decades, there has been little 
msearch, whether fundamental or exploratory, in 
this area: it was considered a solved problem. 
Improving on Photosynthesis 
The process of uptake and fixation of CO2 in 
biological photosynthesis is not an optimized
