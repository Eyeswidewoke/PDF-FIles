785 F.3d 895, "; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, "*; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
below, and the lack of any showing of unfairness or prejudice, there is simply no reason 
why we should exercise our discretion to discard years of litigation on appeal because of 
an inartful opening brief. See A Helping Hand, LLC v. Baltimore Cnty., Md., 515 F.3d 356, 
369 (4th Cir. 2008) (observing that even when an argument has been waived, this Court 
may nonetheless consider it if a "miscarriage of justice would otherwise result" (internal 
quotation marks omitted)); cf. In re Am. W. Airlines, Inc., 217 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir. 
2000) (observing that a court may refuse to find waiver and consider an argument raised 
for the first time on appeal when the issue "is one of law and either does not depend on 
the factual record, or the record has been fully developed"). 
Independent of the adequacy of the workers' opening brief, the district court had no 
grounds to revisit the question of predominance in the first place given this Court's remand 
instructions and mandate in Brown I. Unlike the requirement of commonality under Rule 
23(a)(2) discussed above, Wal-Mart did not change, nor purport to change, the Rule 
23(b)(3) analysis. Indeed, any [*"64] impact of the Supreme Courts ruling on the question 
of whether common questions predominate is only incidental insofar as Wal-Mart 
recalibrated what constitutes a common question in the first place. The majority in Wal-
Mart only invoked Rule 23(b)(3) to argue that the rule's well-established procedural 
protections should apply to the plaintiffs' claims for backpay. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 
2559. 
Following our instructions in Brown I for the district court to "certify the appellants' class 
action." the court found that "the putative class satisfied both the predominance and 
superiority requirements of Rule 23(b)(3)." J.A. 10930. The court then certified the class for 
those employed in all six Nucor operations departments. The district court cites no new 
facts or legal precedent after Brown Ito justify revisiting that determination once the 
underlying question of commonality has been resolved. 
Nonetheless, the dissent insists that our decision in Brown I "did not prevent the district 
court in any way from considering predominance because our prior decision did not say 
anything about predominance." Post at 75-76 (emphasis added). Such a conclusion 
misconstrues both the plain language of our original mandate and ignores the district 
court's equally [*"65] plain understanding of it. The pivotal question in determining the 
scope of the mandate is whether the district court was free on remand to find that the 
workers had not satisfied the predominance requirement. If so, then our mandate did not 
reach the issue and the district court was free to reconsider it. But if the court did not have 
such liberty, then we must ask whether "controlling legal authority has changed 
dramatically" regarding Rule 23(b)(3) such that the court could reconsider the question. 
See Bell, 5 F.3d at 67. If no such change has occurred, then the district court could not 
revisit it. 
0921] As for the first question, the district court had no discretion to find that the workers' 
class failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3), after we expressly told it "to certify the appellants' 
class action and to engage in further proceedings consistent with this opinion." Brown I, 
576 F.3d at 160; see also Bell, 5 F.3d at 66 (requiring that [HN31] a district court 
"implement both the letter and spirit of the . . . mandate, taking into account [our] opinion 
and the circumstances it embraces" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); United 
States v. Pileggi, 703 F.3d 675, 679 (4th Cir. 2013) (observing that the mandate rule
