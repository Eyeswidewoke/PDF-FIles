Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements 
The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other current liabilities, deferred 
compensation, and debt, none of which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, 
accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial 
instruments. The Company's long-term financial liabilities consist of the long-term portion of deferred compensation and long-term debt. The long-
term portion of deferred compensation is recorded at the present value of the liability (which approximates fair value) under the Blue Buffalo 
Company. Ltd. Phantom Equity Plan and is included in other liabilities on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
Long-term debt is recorded on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at issuance price and adjusted for any applicable unamortized 
discounts or premiums. 
l'he Company accounts for its fair value measurements in accordance with accounting guidance which defines fair value, establishes a framework 
for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value 
measurements is as follows: 
Level I- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
Level 2- Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable 
Level .3- Inputs that are unobservable (for example. cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) 
At December 31. 2014 and March 31, 2015, we had approximately $90.1 million and $125.2 million, respectively, of cash invested in money 
market deposit accounts which were included in cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets 
(Level 1). 
The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable. using the fair value of the individual securities as of the beginning of 
the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred. There were no transfers in or out of Level I.. 2, or 3 at the year ended December 31. 2014 and 
during the three months ended March 31. 2015.
