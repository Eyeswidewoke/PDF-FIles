Comment 
Vols: flat, Price: flat, FX: +1%. Marginal sales growth as higher demand in 
Additives & functional, Adhesives & plasticizers and Fibers offset by lower 
demand in Specialty fluids & intermediates. Acquired BP's aviation turbine oil 
business for $283MM. Outlook FY'14 Expects sales to grow at global GDP 
growth rate in H2'14. 
Vole: +4%, Price: flat, FX: +1%. Upside driven by higher demands for coating 
product lines partially offset by continues destocking in China (primarily for 
commercial tires). Outlook: Expects vols to be better in H274. 
Vols: +9%, Price: .4%. FX: +1%. Upside led by higher sales vols for adhesives 
resins and plasticizers more than offsetting lower selling prices due to cont'd 
competitive pressure as increased supply of adhesive resins and weak 
plasticizers demand in APac and Europe regions. 
Vols: flat, Price: flat, FX: +1%. Lower sales growth as higher vets for premium 
products like interlayers with acoustic properties and Eastman Tritan"' 
copolyestei offset by weak demand for Flexvue coated films. Outlook: Expects 
sales growth to be in the range of 4%-5% in H2'14 on higher demand for premium 
Products 
Vols: +2%, Price: +4%, FX: flat. Higher growth driven by improved selling prices 
and sales of acetate flake to EMN's China acetate tow joint venture more than 
offsetting by lower vols of acetate tow due to additional industry capacity. 
Outlook: Expects lower sales vols 17 H2'74 
Vols: -13%%, Price: +2%, FX: Ilat. Downside due to the unplanned shutdown of 
the plant (due to power disruption) and lower sales vols for intermediates 
product line partially offset by improved yob of acetyl-based products. 
Downside primarily due to higher raw material costs. outage costs alongside 
competitive pressure in core products partially offset by better product mix. 
Weakness due to higher raw mat. & energy costs (elm propane) partially offset 
by higher vols. Outlook: FY'14 EBIT: -$410-$430MM. 
Higher earnings due to improved vols. better productivity and lower operating 
costs partially offset by lower prices. Qudook. FY'14 ENT Expects to be more 
than $175MM 
Relatively flat as lower raw material & energy costs offset by costs of the 
unplanned shutdown. Outlook: FY'74 EBIT: -$280-5300MM 
Upside led by higher prices coupled with increased sales of acetate flake to JV 
and lower raw material costs more than offsetting lower tow acetate vols and 
higher operating costs. Outlook:_FY74 ENT -$490MM 
Downside due to lower vols, higher raw material. & energy costs (asp propane) 
alongside costs of the unplanned shutdown at the Kingsport site. Outlook: FY'14 
EBIT: -5300-S320MM 
Outlook• FY'14• -280%
