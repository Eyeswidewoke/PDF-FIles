although Williams continued to be paid his customary one-fifth of group revenue (Street was paid on 
salary for the first eighteen months of his tenure), and worked when he could with the group as an 
adviser and choreographer. After Williams had recovered enough to record again, he recorded two sides 
in 1973 for a debut solo single. However, on August 17, 1973, Williams died in Detroit at the age of 34, 
his death ruled a suicide by the Wayne County coroner. 
The Temptations in the early 1970s 
Upon the return to Motown several lineup changes occurred. Louis Price departed from the group and 
joined the Drifters. Dennis Edwards—who had made an unsuccessful attempt at developing a solo 
career during his three-year exit from the group—returned to the lineup. And Berry Gordy co-wrote and 
produced "Power", the Temptations' first single under the new contract. "Power", from the album of the 
same name, hit #11 on the R&B charts but failed to chart in the Top 40. Two years of under-performing 
singles and albums followed, including an eponymous album with Philadelphia-based producer Thom 
Bell, until Motown began planning a Temptations reunion tour in 1982. 
Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin agreed to rejoin the group for the new album, aptly titled Reunion, and 
its subsequent promotional tour. Rick James, Melvin Franklin's nephew and the Motown funk star who 
had previously used the Temptations as backup vocalists on his 1981 hit "Super Freak", wrote, produced, 
and guested on the Reunion album's lead single, "Standing on the Top". The single went to number-six 
on the R&B charts and featured Ruffin, Kendricks and Edwards trading back and forth on lead. 
While the ensuing Reunion tour with all seven Temptations (Ruffin, Kendricks, Otis Williams, Franklin, 
Edwards, Richard Street, and Glenn Leonard) was financially successful, it ended up being a stressful 
venture. Kendricks' voice had weakened after decades of chain smoking, Ruffin, still addicted to drugs, 
missed a number of the performances due to being incapacitated, and current group members Dennis 
Edwards and Glenn Leonard were causing problems. At the conclusion of the Reunion tour, Ruffin and 
Kendricks departed, and they began touring and performing together as a duo. 
One more album, Surface Thrills, released in 1983, featured a sharp departure in the group's sound by 
incorporating elements of then-current rock. Following its release, Glenn Leonard was let go and 
replaced by Ron Tyson, who was with the Philadelphia groups the Ethics and Love Committee. Tyson had 
been a staff songwriter at Atlantic during the Temptations' tenure at that label, and co-wrote several 
songs on the album Hear to Tempt You. 
From the 1980s to the 1990s 
By this time, the Temptations' releases were no longer performing well on the pop charts, though some 
singles still made the R&B Top 20. "Love on My Mind Tonight," a single from Surface Thrills, charted at 
number 17. 
The lineup of Franklin, Williams, Street, Tyson, and Edwards proved to be short-lived. The five 
performed on Motown 25 and released the direct to video The Temptations: Live in Concert (filmed at 
Harrah's Atlantic City). The album Back to Basics, released later in 1983, was the first album featuring
