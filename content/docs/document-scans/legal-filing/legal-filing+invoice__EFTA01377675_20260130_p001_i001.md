MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the information set forth under "Selected

discussion, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,

Overview 
We started Square in February 2009 to enable anyone with a mobile device to accept card payments, anywhere, anytime. 
While we found early success providing easy access to card payments, commerce extends beyond payments. In every transaction, 
we see opportunity for our sellers: to learn more about which products are selling best, to reinvest in their businesses, or to create 
and engage loyal buyers. Although we currently generate approximately 95% of our revenue from payments and point-of-sale 
(POS) services, which includes the impact of revenue generated from Starbucks, we have extended our product and service 
offerings to include financial services and marketing services, all to help sellers start, run, and grow their businesses. 
We work to democratize commerce—leveling the playing field for sellers of all sizes. Our focus on technology and design 
allows us to create products and services that are accessible, intuitive, and easy-to-use. We set attractive and transparent pricing, 
and we accept approximately 95% of sellers who seek to process payments with Square. We provide a free software app with our 
affordable (often free) hardware to turn mobile devices into powerful POS solutions in minutes. Our insights into our sellers' 
businesses have allowed us to develop services that are applicable to businesses of all types and sizes, from Square Analytics to 
digital receipts. We also continue to add advanced software features that tailor our POS solution to specific types of sellers, such 
as open tickets for bars and restaurants and inventory management for retailers.
