enforcement originally "called it a hunting accident." However, "Kentucky State Police said they 
were investigating Tommy Ballard's death as a murder, but in the three and a half years since

Ballard's case to its website as well as" a few others. 
Ten Charged With Belonging To Cleveland Street Gang Implicated In Crimes. 
The Cleveland Plain Dealer (11/19, Shaffer, 895K) reports that in Ohio, ten "are charged with 
belonging to a street gang that dealt drugs in the city's southeast side, authorities announced 
Thursday." They are "members of the Percy Homies gang face charges including drug 
trafficking, criminal gang activity and weapons violations, according to a joint news release 
from Cleveland police, the Cleveland FBI and Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O'Malley's 
Office." Prosecutors on Thursday "filed a motion to unseal the secret indictment that a grand

FBI task force members "arrested six of the men and executed search warrants in which 
officers seized seven guns, drugs and an unspecified amount of cash." 
Serial Killer Blamed For Two Murders In Miami In 1970s. 
The AP (11/19, Lush) reports that serial killer Samuel Little has been blamed for two murders in 
Miami in the 1970s. Little, who has "been behind bars since 2012," will not "be charged in the 
two Miami murders." Little "told investigators he was responsible for about 90 killings 
nationwide between 1970 and 2005," and the FBI "said its crime analysts believe all of his 
confessions are credible." The FBI has also provided numerous drawings of his victims. 
Kansas Man Indicted On Federal Fraud Charges. 
The Hays (KS) Post (11/19) reports, "A Kansas man who ran an autopsies-for-hire business was 
indicted Wednesday on federal fraud charges, according to U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister." 
Authorities seek "to recover more than $1 million in fees paid by the defendant's clients." The 
man is accused of falsely leading clients "to believe they would receive an autopsy report 
prepared by a pathologist." However, "in most of the cases, no pathologist was involved in the 
work on the autopsies." He "offered private autopsy services through his business, National 
Autopsy Services, based in Topeka." The FBI is looking for victims of the scheme.

been rescheduled again for two people connected to" a 2017 murder in Suisun City. The two 
suspects "were scheduled to appear Monday in Department 15 for a readiness conference and 
to hear the trial date, but Judge Robert Bowers reset the proceedings for 9 a.m. Jan. 20 in the 
Justice Building in Vallejo." The reschedulings come after a defense attorney "asked Judge John 
B. Ellis during a late-January proceeding in the Hall of Justice in Fairfield to consider a motion to 
dismiss all - or parts of - a June 2019 Solano County grand jury indictment of her client." The 
two "face first-degree murder charges in connection to the death" of the daughter-in-law of 
one.

traveling to engage in illicit sexual contact, which could mean at least 10 years in federal prison 
if he's convicted." The US Attorney's Office investigation "leading to the federal charges involved 
a search of the victim's cell phone and contact from Lettieri's Facebook account and phone 
number." The man "made an initial appearance in federal court and on Nov. 13, he was detained 
to await further legal action." FBI is "still investigating allegations involving" the man.
