The Company announced on May 3, 1999 that it expects to report April total sales of $639.9 million, an increase in 
comparable store sales of 5% and fi=st quarter earnings per Share of $.14, an increase of 56% over an adjusted $.0= per 
Share in 1998. This represents a significant increase over the current Wall Street consensus estimate of $.10 per Share, 
and is primarily the resu=t of strong first quarter performances at the Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant and Limited 
Too brands, as well as at Intimate Brands. 
Additionally, the Company announced on May 3, 1999 that, due to the momentu= in its apparel brands, it expects to 
exceed the current second quarter Wall Street consensus estimate of $.15 per share by $.03.

Pro Forma Financial Information 
Set forth below is certain unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries 
based on historical information which has been adjusted to reflect (i) the consummation of the Limited Too spinoff and 
the related transactions described in the Notes to Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and (ii) the 
purchase of 15,000,000 Shares at an assumed price of $55.00 per Share pursuant to the Offer and the related 
transactions described in the Notes to Summary Unaudi=ed Pro Forma Financial Information. In addition, such 
information reflects the reclassification of approximately $352 million of restricted cash as a resu=t of the rescission of 
the Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement. The Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Income 
gives effect to the ab=ve transactions as if they occurred on February 1, 1998 and the Summary Unaudi=ed Pro Forma 
Consolidated Balance Sheet gives effect to the transactions as if they occurred on January 30, 1999. The assumptions on 
which the pro forma financial information is based are further described in the Notes to Summar= Unaudited Pro Forma 
Financial Information. Management of the Company believ=s that the assumptions used provide a reasonable basis on 
which to present th= Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements. The pro forma financial information does not 
purport to be indicative of the results which would actually have been achieved if the Offer and the Limited Too spinoff 
and related transactions had been completed as of such dates or which may be achieved in the future. The pro forma 
financial information should be read =n conjunction with the accompanying notes thereto and the consolidated 
financ=al statements and related notes set forth in the Company's 1998 Annual Rep=rt, as well as the summary historical 
financial information set forth above.
