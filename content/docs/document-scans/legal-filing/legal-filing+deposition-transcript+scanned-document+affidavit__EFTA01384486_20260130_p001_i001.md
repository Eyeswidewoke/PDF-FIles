IR September 2017 
Long•Term Asset Return Study. The Next Financial Crisis 
have highlighted in previous versions of this note - as well as in the mean 
reversion section of this report - we can't help thinking that we're setting 
ourselves up for a return to a few negative real return decades ahead in bonds 
as we venture out towards 2050. 
International Returns 
Fixed income is the asset class for which we have the longest dated data 
series globally. There is definitely a survivor bias in fixed income though. 
Although the majority of the analysed countries with data back to 1900 in our 
study have provided positive real returns over this period there have been 
some notable exceptions with France (-1.2% p.a.), Italy (-1.9% p.a.) and Japan 
(-0.6% p.a.) all seeing negative real returns. Germany would be the worst if we 
had reliable data through the hyperinflation period in the 1920s. So this shows 
that negative real returns in bonds are a real possibility over even very long 
periods of time. 
For equities we only really have comprehensive returns data for a critical mass 
of countries post WWII and if we look at returns over the last 50 years most 
developed markets see real annualised returns between +5-6% p.a. The only 
real notable laggard has been Italy (+1.7% p.a.), although Canada, Japan and 
Spain have all provided annualised real returns of less than +5%. Since 1980, 
the period we have previously identified as being the start of a secular global 
bull market, virtually every country has a higher return for equities and bonds 
than their long-term average. A notable exception has been Japan as it 
obviously went through its demographic boom and bust earlier than others. 
Since the Euro was introduced in 1999, there is little doubt that equity returns 
in Europe have been disappointing. However this period did coincide with the 
global equity market bubble so returns are best compared with the US and UK 
(both +3.5% p.a. real adjusted) for context. Germany is marginally better 
(+3.7% p.a.) but Greece (-7.1% p.a.) and Portugal (-1.1% p.a.) have all failed to 
see positive real total returns (including dividends) since the single currency 
came into existence nearly 18 years ago. Italy (+0.6% pa.), Spain (+2.3% p.a.) 
and Ireland (+2.0% p.a.) also come out of the post Euro world with below trend 
returns. Such poor returns for the weakest Euro economies' equity markets, 
especially those still in negative territory after nearly 18 years, is a worrying 
statistic for the supporters of the single currency era. 
Government bond returns since the Euro commenced are strong across the 
board due to the themes explored in previous reports, but investors also have 
central banks to thank for this in the weakest Euro area countries. Without 
their intervention its possible we would have seen sovereign defaults over and 
above the haircuts that investors took in Greece. This would have wiped out 
returns in fixed income that as history shows are hard to get back over even 
the very long-term. 
We also include tables using similar time frames to show long-term nominal 
and real GDP for a host of DM and EM countries. We've also converted into 
dollars to allow some comparison through time. 
The full data is shown in the pages ahead covering nominal and real returns 
and also includes a shorter history for various EM countries. For all returns we 
also show nominal returns through time in dollar terms. For visual ease we 
have shaded the periods where negative returns have been seen.
