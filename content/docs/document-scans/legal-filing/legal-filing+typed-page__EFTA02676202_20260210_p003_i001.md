SPOT LIGHT ON 
In addition to providing a path to a step-up in asset basis, the 
Up-C structure also allows pre-IPO owners to preserve their 
retained ownership in the business through a pass-though 
entity for US federal income tax purposes, which generally 
avoids an entity level corporate tax. 
significant portion of the value of many businesses. In certain 
cases, the amortization of intangibles can be subject to limita-
tions under so-called anti-churning rules in IRC Section 197, 
which should be carefully analyzed. Certain tangible assets 
(for example, real property (other than land, which is not 
depreciable)) have depredation periods longer than I S years. 
Section 338(h)( I 0) Transact ion 
In an IRC Section 338(h)(10) transaction, the stock of the 
historic operating corporation is contributed to a newly-
formed corporation, which will serve as the public company. 
The contribution (together with the subsequent sale of stock 
to public investors) intentionally fails IRC Section 351 and any 
other tax rules that would otherwise treat the contribution as 
a tax-free transaction (often referred to as a busted Section 
351 transaction). Instead, the contributors and the transferee 
make a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) to treat the 
contribution as a taxable deemed sale of assets for US federal 
income tax purposes, and not as a sale of stock. 
This structure results in a fair market value basis in the public 
company's assets.To bust the tax-free Section 351 transaction, 
the historic equity owners often must sell a portion of their 
stock in the public company as part of the IPO. In addition, the 
public company may also issue stock to the public in a primary 
offering. An example of a BasisTRA using a Section 338(h)(10) 
transaction is the TRA entered into in connection with the IPO 
by Cooper Industries, Inc. of its subsidiary, Belden Inc. General 
Electric also used this structure in connection with the IPO of 
its Genworth subsidiary. 
Up-C Structure 
Recently, partnership or 'Up-C" structures have also achieved 
a fair market value asset basis in connection with ll'Os of 
businesses historically operated as partnerships. Under this 
structure, a newly-formed corporation is organized to serve 
as the public company.Thc public company uses cash it raises 
to buy interests in the partnership or limited liability company 
(LLC) (the operating partnership) from the pre-IPO owners 
of the operating partnership. The pre-IPO owners generally 
retain operating partnership interests as well. 
Economically, the operating partnership interests retained by 
the pre-IPO owners are recapitalized to create parity in value 
between the operating partnership interests and the public 
company stock. Those operating partnership interests are 
also made exchangeable into the public company stock. This 
gives the pre-IPO owners liquidity in their retained operating 
partnership interests. 
A critical element of an Up-C structure is an election by the 
operating partnership under IRC Section 754.This tax election 
provides a purchaser of partnership interests with a fair market 
value basis in the assets of the partnership to the extent of 
the proportionate share of the purchased interest. As a result, 
when the pre-IPO owners sell operating partnership interests 
to the public company in connection with the 11'O, or exchange 
operating partnership interests for public company stock in the 
future by exercising the exchange right, the public company (as 
purchaser) obtains a fair market value basis in a proportionate 
share of the assets of the operating partnership. 
The Up-C structure has been especially popular in connection 
with the ll'Os of asset management companies (for example, 
The Blackstone Group LP and Fortress Investment Group 
LLC) because these types of businesses tend to be operated 
as partnerships prior to an IPO. Other examples include the 
lI'Os of Duff & Phelps Corporation and Graham Packaging 
Company Inc. (which also entered into an NOL Tit A, as 
mentioned below). 
In addition to providing a path to a step-up in asset basis, the 
Up-C structure also allows pre-IPO owners to preserve their 
retained ownership in the business through a pass-though entity 
for US federal income tax purposes, which generally avoids an 
entity level corporate tax.
