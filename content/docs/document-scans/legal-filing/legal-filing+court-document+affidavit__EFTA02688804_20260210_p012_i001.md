VI. ISSUES THAT REQUIRE MORE INVESTIGATION 
We have seen that the hypotheses introduced here have a simple realization which reproduces quantum mechanics. Nonethe-
less, as with any novel idea, there are issues which will require more thought. 
• What exactly defines the ensemble that corresponds to the quantum state? We need it to correspond to the ensemble of 
systems made from the same constituents, subject to the same forces, that also share the same pure quantum state. Is there 
a precise characterization of these ensembles that does not refer to the concept of quantum state? Does it suffice to say 
that these systems have the same constituents, preparation and environment? 
Such a characterization of the ensembles only makes sense in a context in which quantum mechanics is asserted to be 
an approximation to a different cosmological theory. The use of macrosystems to initialize and define preparations of 
microsystems as a primitive notion has in common with Bohrs viewpoint that quantum physics requires a distinction 
between micro and macro systems. This demands that there be some more fundamental theory that quantum theory 
approximates for small subsystems of a universe. 
• A related issue concerns the relationship between different coarse grainings of the beables used to provide the ensembles 
from which a quantum theory may be derived. As we have seen in the discussion of the classical limit, a system such as 
a macroscopic body whose fine grained description is unique may be coarse grained to yield an ensemble. The copy rule 
can be applied to different coarse grained models of the same system yielding different quantum mechanical models. This 
need not be a conceptual problem, so long as we take the view that quantum mechanics is always an approximation to a 
deeper theory. This accords with much of the practice of quantum field theory and statistical physics, which is to regard 
all the theories in common use as effective theories which are based on some degree of coarse graining of the degrees of 
freedom. Because nothing on the derivation of the Schrodinger equation depends on the size of the ensemble, apart from 
the requirement that all the beable occupation numbers are large, different models, based on different coarse grainings, 
will lead to different quantum mechanical descriptions, which are presumably related themselves by coarse paining. But 
there are two very interesting questions for further investigation here. First, can we work out the precise relationship 
between coarse graining the dynamics described here and coarse graining the quantum dynamics? Second, could there be 
real observable effects coming from corrections to quantum physics that will depend on the size of the ensemble? 
• What about composite systems? Equally important, how are hierarchies of composite systems to be treated? A quark is 
part of a quantum system which is a proton, it is also part of a nucleus, an atom, a molecule, a quantum gate. There are 
ensembles connected with each of these. Are the beables associated only with the highest level of the hierarchy that is still 
quantum mechanical, or can a single beable evolve with respect to several systems it is a part of? 
This issue is also crucial for understanding if this proposal can resolve classic issues in quantum theory such as entangle-
ment and Wigncr's friend. 
• Does the ensemble require a preferred simultaneity to define it? We could embrace this, in common also with deBroglie-
Bohm and assert that the world of beables is one with a preferred notion of simultaneity. Or we could explore the possibility 
that the ensemble is defined relativistially, for example to refer to all identically constituted and prepared systems in the 
whole spacetime. Recent research in general relativity has revealed that there is a preferred notion of simultaneity that 
may play a key role in simplifying the dynamics of the theoryl6l. 
• What picks the beables? Do the beables change when the system is put through a different filter? Or is there a single 
preferred basis, ie momentum space? 
• How is the connection between linear operators and observables non-diagonal in the beables established? Presumably as 
in dBB probabilities computed in a single basis suffice but it would be good to clarify this. 
• The mechanism of phase alignment just discussed is ad hoc and can probably be improved on. In particular. the question 
of the stability of the solution that leads to phase alignment and Schroedinger dynamics must be investigated. 
• The nodes issue. This is the most serious problem of this list. Recall that we required for the recovery of quantum 
mechanics that all na >> 0. This fails at nodes of wavefunctions, which is for a such that p(a) = na = 0. It is easy to 
see that the correspondence between the rules we so far posited and quantum mechanics also breaks down when there are 
such beables. 
For suppose in the initial state defined by the preparation na(i = 0) = 0 for some a = ao. Then it follows that no(r) = 0 for 
all time. for there is nothing to copy. Indeed:
