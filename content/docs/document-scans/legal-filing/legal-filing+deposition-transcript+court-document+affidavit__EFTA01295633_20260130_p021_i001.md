785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
The district court has revisited certification and decertified the promotions class in light of 
the Supreme Court's opinion in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 
U.S. 
, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 
180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011).' We thus again confront the question of whether the workers' 
have presented a common question of employment discrimination through evidence of 
racism in the workplace. Despite Wal-Mart's reshaping of the class action landscape, we 
hold that the district court has for a second time erred in refusing to certify the workers' 
class, where (1) statistics indicate that promotions at Nucor depended in part on whether 
an individual was black or white; (2) substantial anecdotal evidence suggests 
discrimination in specific promotions decisions in multiple plant departments; and (3) there 
is also significant evidence that those promotions decisions were made in the context of a 
racially hostile [**3] work environment. 
1 The district court refused to decertify the wotters hostile work environment claim. We have previously deried as untimely 
Nucor's petition for interlocutory review of that decision. Nucor Corp. v. Brown. 760 F.3d 341.342 (4th Cir. 2014). 
Against that backdrop, the district court fundamentally misapprehended the reach of Wal-
Mart and its application to the workers' promotions class. We thus vacate the district 
courts decision in part and remand for re-certification of the class. 
I. 
The Nucor plant encompasses six production departments that work together to melt, 
form, finish, and ship steel products to customers. See Brown I, 576 F.3d at 151. At the 
start of this litigation, 611 employees worked at the plant. Seventy-one (11.62%) were 
black? There was, however, at most one black supervisor in the production departments 
until after the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") initiated charges that 
preceded the putative class action. 
2 By comparison. more than 38% of the available local labor market is black. according to Census data provided by the 
workers' experts. 
The workers' promotions claim rests on alternative theories of liability under Title VII, which 
prohibits employment discrimination because of an individual's "race, color, religion, rig 
sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. The promotions claim first alleges a pattern 
or practice of racially disparate treatment in promotions decisions. See Teamsters v. 
United States, 431 U.S. 324, 336, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1977). Second, it 
charges that Nucor's facially neutral promotions policies and procedures had a racially 
disparate impact. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. 
Ed. 2d 158 (1971); Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2554. 
Both theories are grounded in a statistical analysis of racial disparities in job pro p899] 
motions at the plant combined with anecdotal evidence of discrimination. The workers' 
statistical evidence spans the four-year period preceding the litigation, between December 
1999 and December 2003. Because Nucor destroyed and/or discarded the actual bidding 
data for the period before 2001, the workers' experts established an alternative benchmark 
using 'change-of-status' forms filed by the company whenever a promotion took place at
