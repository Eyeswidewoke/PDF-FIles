the West's own primacy. Even the most doctrinaire neocon ass=mes that American and Western hegemony must come 
to an end at some point. =ut that won't matter since the Rest will end up being just like us—hol=ing free elections, 
embracing the free markets, committed to a liberal form of nationalism and to the separation of religi=n of state. Such 
values and practices will guarantee that rising states li=e China and India bind themselves to a liberal international order 
based o= functioning multilateral institutions, free international trade, and collective security. Kupchan doe=n't buy this 
vision. The "Western Way" is not being universalized, h= argues, and the international system looks more and more like 
a mosaic of=nations, each following its own path towards modernization, a path determined by unique historical 
circumstances and cultural traditio=s that may not result in anything like our own liberal and democratic prin=iples. 
Hence, China can embrace a form of "communal autocrac=," Russia chooses a system of "paternal autocracy," while the 
Arab world follows the route of "religious and tribal autocrac=." Iran remains a theocracy, and other non-liberal political 
orders may =lourish in parts of Latin America and Africa. 
In a way, Kupchan is=doing here what foreign-policy intellectuals do best, inventing catchy lab=ls to describe existing 
trends in China, Russia, and the Arab world that a=e familiar to anyone who follows current events. Kupchan argues, 
however, that these trends are quite enduring and =hat the United States and Europe should deal with this reality 
instead of =ursuing policies based on wishful thinking—expecting, for example, that =he Islamists ruling Egypt and the 
communist-fascists in Beijing will eventually be replaced by a bunch of li=eral democrats. It ain't going to happen, 
Kupchan predicts. Free electio=s can in fact lead to the victory of anti-Western and anti-American leader=, while 
capitalism is just a system that allows governments to harness wealth for aggressive nationalist polic=es. 
As many conservative= would point out, the notion that we are all taking part in an inexorable =arch towards 
enlightenment, prosperity, and liberty that culminates in the=embrace of liberal democracy, representative 
government, and free markets here, there, and everywhere is only one versi=n of history, described sometimes as "Whig 
history." What is bas=cally the story of the emergence of constitutional democracy in Britain an= America has been 
applied broadly to describe the political and economic development of Europe and West in general from =round 150O to 
1800—and to explain why the West prospered and rose to glo=al prominence while other parts of the world, like the 
Ottoman Empire and =hina, stagnated and declined. 
Kupchan himself subs=ribes to a Whiggish narrative, in which decentralized feudal power structu=es and the rise of an 
enlightened middle class that challenged the monarch=, aristocracy, and the church led to Europe developing modern 
liberal states and capitalism, while the Reformat=on exposed religion to rational inquiry and unleashed bloodshed that 
ultim=tely caused European societies to accept religious diversity. The growing =osts of the modern state forced 
monarchs to share power with ever larger classes of citizens, while the ri=ing middle class provided the economic and 
intellectual foundations for th= Industrial Revolution, which in turn improved education and science and e=tablished the 
military power that allowed the West to achieve superiority over the more rigid hierarchical o=ders of the Ottoman 
Empire, India, China, and elsewhere. 
Francis Fukuyama in =he Origins of Political Order has argued that this Whig version of history=may help explain how 
Britain and America developed. But in other parts of =urope, such political and economic changes as the rise of the 
modern state and notions of citizenship and pol=tical accountability were driven in large part by the villains of the 
Whig=narrative, including monarchy and the Catholic Church. 
There have always be=n different paths towards political and economic modernity, not only in co=temporary China, 
India, Iran, and Brazil, but also in Europe and the West =etween 1500 and 1800—and later, with the rise of communism 
and fascism. Russia is an example of a nation whose =oad towards economic growth has been very different from that 
taken by the=Anglo-Americans, or for that matter, the Germans, the French, or the Chine=e. 
IljKupchan cou=d have provided us with a more simplified set of arguments to support his =hesis—that China and Iran 
are not "like us"—by recognizing that th= political and economic transformation of different European states was not 
based on a standard model of development. We there=ore shouldn't be surprised that Egypt and Brazil are also choosing 
their=own non-Whig paths of change and growth.
