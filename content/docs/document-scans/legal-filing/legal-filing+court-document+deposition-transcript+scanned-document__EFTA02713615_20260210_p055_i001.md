subject to withholding or other taxes imposed by such countries. In addition, the Partnership 
may also be subject to foreign taxes on gains on foreign securities in some of the foreign 
countries where it purchases and sells securities. Tax treaties between certain countries and the 
United States may reduce or eliminate such taxes. The Partnership may structure investments in 
foreign securities through other entities in order to reduce foreign taxes. It is impossible to 
predict the rate of foreign tax the Partnership will pay in advance since the amount of the 
Partnership's assets to be invested in various countries is not known. 
The Partners will be informed by the Partnership as to their proportionate share of the 
foreign taxes paid by the Partnership. The Partners generally will be entitled to claim either a 
credit (subject to limitations) or, if they itemize their deductions, a deduction for their share of 
such foreign taxes in computing their federal income taxes. 
State and Local Taxation 
In addition to the federal income tax consequences described above, prospective investors 
should consider potential state and local tax consequences of an investment in the Partnership. 
No attempt is made herein to provide an in-depth discussion of such state or local tax 
consequences. State and local laws may often differ from federal income tax laws with respect 
to the treatment of specific items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. A Partner's 
distributive share of the taxable income or loss of the Partnership generally will be required to be 
included in determining his income for state and local tax purposes in the jurisdiction(s) in which 
he is a resident. 
The Partnership should not be subject to the New York City unincorporated business tax 
("UST") because UBT is not imposed on a partnership which solely buys and sells securities for 
its own account, unless its activities cause it to be characterized as a "dealer" in securities. A 
Partner who is an individual that is not a resident of New York State is not subject to New York 
State tax solely as a result of being a partner in a partnership that buys and sells securities for its 
own account. New York City does not tax individuals who are not residents of New York City. 
A Partner which is a non-New York corporation may not be subject to New York State or New 
York City tax solely as a result of being a Partner in the Partnership because of an exception for 
limited partners in portfolio investment partnerships, which is determined on a year by year 
basis. 
Each prospective Limited Partner must consult his own tax advisors regarding such state 
and local tax consequences. 
Future Tax Legislation, Necessity of Obtaining Professional Advice 
Future amendments to the Code, other legislation, new or amended Treasury Regulations, 
administrative rulings or decisions by the Service, or judicial decisions may adversely affect the 
federal income tax or other tax aspects of an investment in the Partnership, with or without 
advance notice, retroactively or prospectively. The foregoing analysis is not intended as a 
substitute for careful tax planning. The tax matters relating to the Partnership are complex and 
are subject to varying interpretations. Moreover, the effect of existing income tax laws and of 
proposed changes in income tax laws on Partners will vary with the particular circumstances of
