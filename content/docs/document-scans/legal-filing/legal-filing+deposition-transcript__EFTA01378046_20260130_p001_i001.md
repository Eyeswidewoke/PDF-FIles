Restricted Stock. 
A participant will not recognize taxable income at the time shares of restricted stock are granted and we will not be entitled to a tax 
deduction at such time, unless the participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed at grant. If such an election is made. the 
participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income (and subject to income tax withholding in the case of employees) at the time of the grant in 
an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at such time over the amount, if any, paid for such shares. If such an election is not 
made, the participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income (and subject to income tax withholding in the case of employees) at the time the 
restrictions lapse in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at such time over the amount, if any, paid for such shares. The 
Company is entitled to a corresponding deduction at the time the ordinary income Is recognized by the participant, except to the extent the deduction limits of 
Section 162(m) of the Code apply. In addition, a participant

receiving dividends with respect to restricted stock for which the above•described election has not been made and prior to the time the restrictions lapse will 
recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income (and subject to income tax withholding in the case of employees), rather than dividend income. The 
Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, except to the extent the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Code apply. 
Restricted Stock Units. 
A participant will not recognize taxable income when restricted stock units are granted. and we will not be entitled to a tax deduction 
at such time. A participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income (and subject to income tax withholding in the case of employees) at the 
time of settlement of the award equal to the fair market value of any shares delivered and the amount of cash paid by us. and we will be entitled to a 
corresponding deduction, except to the extent the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Code apply. 
Section 162(m) Limitations. 
As explained above. Section 162(m) of the Code generally places a 51 million annual limit on a Company's tax deduction for 
compensation paid to certain senior executives, other than compensation that qualifies as "performance-based compensation,- as defined under 
Section 162(m) of the Code. The 2015 Plan is designed so that stock options and SARs qualify for this exemption, and it also permits the Compensation 
Committee to grant other awards designed to qualify for this exception. However, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to grant awards that do not 
qualify for this exception, and, in some cases, the exception may cease to be available for some or all awards that otherwise so qualify. Thus, it is possible 
that Section 162(m) of the Code may disallow compensation deductions that would otherwise be available to the Company. 
The foregoing general tax discussion is intended for the information of stockholders and not as tax guidance to participants in the 2015 Plan. Participants are 
strongly urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the federal, state, local, foreign and other tax consequences to them of participating in the 2015 
Plan.
