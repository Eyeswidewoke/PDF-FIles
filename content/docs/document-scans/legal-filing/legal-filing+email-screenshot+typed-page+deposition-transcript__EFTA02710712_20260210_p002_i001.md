No one =enies that police officers have hard jobs, but they volunteer to enter that line of work. There is no draft. So 
these dis=arities cannot go unaddressed and uncorrected. To be held in high esteem you must also be held to a higher 
standard. And no one denies that high-crime neighborhoods disproportionately overlap with minority neighborhoods. 
But the intersections don't stop there. Concentrated poverty play= a consequential role. So does the school-to-prison 
pipeline. So do the scars of historical oppression. In fact, these and other factors intersect to such a degree that trying 
to separate any one 4k=94 most often, the racial one — from the rest is bound to render a flimsy a=gument based on 
the fallacy of discrete factors.

Yet people continue to make such argume=ts, which can usually be distilled to some variation of this: Black dysfunction 
is mostly or even solely the result of black pathology. This argument is racist at its =ore because it rests too heavily on 
choice and too lightly on context. If you scratc= it, what oozes out reeks of race-informed cultural decay or even genetic 
deficiency and predisposition,=as if America is not the progenitor — the great-grandmother — =f African-American 
violence. And yes, racist is the word that we must use. Racism doesn't require the presence of malice, only the 
presence of bias and ignorance, willful or otherwise. It doesn't even require more than one race. There are plenty of 
members of aggrieved groups who are part of the self-flagellation industria= complex. They make a name (and a profit) 
saying inflammatory t=ings about their own groups, things that are full of sting but lack context, thi=gs that others will 
say only behind tightly shut doors. These are often =eople who've "made it" and look down their =oses with be-more-
like-me disdain at those who haven't, as if success were me=ely a result of a collection of choices and not also of a 
confluence of circumstances. 
Today, too many people are gun-shy about using the word racism, lest they themselves be called race-baiters. So we are 
witnes=ing an assault on the concept of racism, an attempt to erase legitimate discussion and grievance by degra=ing 
the language: Eliminate the word and you elude the charge. 
By endlessly claiming =hat the word is overused as an attack, the overuse, through rhetorical sleight of hand, is amplified 
in the dismis=al. The word is snatched from its serious scientific and sociological context and redefined simply as a 
weapon of argumentation, the hand grenade you toss under the table to blow things up =nd halt the conversation when 
things get too "honest" or "uncomfortable." But people will not fall f=r that chicanery. The language will survive. The 
concept will not be corrupted. Racism is a real thing, not because the "racial grievance industry" refuses to release it, but 
beca=se society has failed to eradicate it. 
Racism is interpersonal and structural; it is current=and historical; it is explicit and implicit; it is articulated and 
silent.Q=A0 Biases are pervasive, but can also be spectral: moving in and out of consideration with little or no notice, 
with=ut leaving a trace, even without our own awareness. Sometimes the only w=y to see bias is in the aggregate, to 
stop staring so hard at a data point and step back so that yo= can see the data set. Only then can you detect the trails in 
the dust. Only then can the data do battle with denial. I would love to live in a world where that wasn't the case. Eve= 
more, I would love my children to inherit a world where that wasn't the case, where the margin for error for =hem was 
the same as the margin for error for everyone else's children, where I =ould rest assured that police treatment would be 
unbiased. But I don't.=C2* Reality doesn't bend under the weight of wishes. Truth doesn't grow dim because we 
squint.
