=ith Jeffrey Epstein after it emerged that the convicted paedophile =anded his private jet at an RAF fighter base during a 
visit [to see the ruke) at Sandringham." Cor! 
However, a closer reading of the body of the story yields the =act that the visit occurred back in 2000, many years before 
Epstein's =rial and conviction; and a Ministry of Defence spokesman admitted that =ivil aircraft are "routinely granted 
permission" to land at RAF =ases. So, not exactly "Cor!"; in fact, barely "Well, I =ever". 
I do recall thinking the friendship between Epstein =nd Andrew rather surprisingYet the Telegraph's story was a model =f 
understatement compared with the Daily Mirror's grotesque effort on =he same day: "Prince Andrew was dealt a fresh 
blow last night after =I was revealed pervert friend Jeffrey Epstein met his girls as =hildren. Papers show the paedophile, 
jailed for luring a young girl =nto prostitution, mingled with Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice in the =ahamas in 1998. A 
palace insider said: 'It was a fleeting meeting =ith Epstein, but it is still a great worry.— That's it; that's =he whole story, 
in full. Read it and weep — with laughter at the =utrageous contrivance of it all. 
I suppose, before I am outed by the Mirror as a paedophile at =ne remove, I had better confess all. In January 1999 we 
enjoyed a brief =amily holiday at Epstein's now notorious Florida home. My wife had =nown Epstein since the mid-
1980s; when she told him in the winter of =998 that our younger child had been most unwell for a long period, he =aid 
that what she needed was some sunshine and insisted we stay at his =alm Beach home. 
The place was empty, apart from us and the housekeeper; but, =es, I did notice a photograph in it of Epstein and his 
then girlfriend =hislaine Maxwell with Prince Andrew. This, of course, was before Andrew =ook on the job of being 
Britain's "special trade representative" =97 and long before the world knew of Epstein's involvement with =eenage girls 
(not the same thing as "paedophilia", by the way, =ince none of the girls was pre-pubescent, but undeniably both sordid 
=nd exploitative). 
I do recall thinking the friendship between Epstein and =ndrew rather surprising, but only because of the vast gulf in 
interests =nd intellect. Epstein is not interested in golf. The Coney Island-born =on of a New York park attendant, he 
began his career as a teacher of =hysics and calculus, later putting his remarkable mathematical =bilities to more 
profitable use as a financial trader and =dviser. 
As a billionaire he retained a consuming fascination with =cience, being a member of the New York Academy of Sciences 
and a =isiting fellow at Harvard: his biggest charitable donations are in the =ields of particle physics and artificial 
intelligence. 
On the one occasion I had a =onversation with him, it was about the development of chess computers =nd how they 
could be made to simulate human methods of calculation; it =oon became embarrassingly clear that I could not grasp a 
fraction of =hat he understood. As I said, it was impossible to see what he had in =ommon, intellectually at least, with 
the Duke of York. On the other =and, the notionally republican Americans have a perennial obsession =ith the British 
royal family — the impending wedding of Prince =illiam and Catherine Middleton seems almost bigger news there than 
here =97 and I suspect Epstein, an avid collector of objects and people, =anted to add a part of the House of Windsor to 
his fabulously expensive =ortfolio of exotica. 
Unfortunately, Andrew, trade ambassador or not, seems =lithely unaware of when he is being bought: it was this 
newspaper that =evealed he had accepted an offer of ElSm for his former Sunninghill =ome — £3m over the already 
ludicrous asking price — from a Kazakh =il and gas billionaire purporting to be "a friend". This is a =lassic case of the 
"unsolicited gift", given in the hope of a later =eturn of a favour. His negotiation last year of a $24,500 (£15,000) =oan 
from Epstein to help pay down his ex-wife's wearyingly habitual =ebts is on a very different scale; but, to put it at its 
most cynical, =hy risk the scandal this would cause for such a trivial sum?
