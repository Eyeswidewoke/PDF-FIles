familiar, particularly to readers of journalism and books by The Washin=ton Post's Rajiv Chandrasekaran. Rohde's 
discussion of Islamist moveme=ts in Egypt, in particular, fails to keep pace with the rapid developments=of the past year. 
His overarching theme is that "the most potent long-ter= weapon against jihadists is moderate Arabs and South Asians, 
not American=soldiers." He suggests that Washington "quietly, consistently and effectively strengthen those groups" 
that a=e "our true allies in the region." As a guide to battling al-Qaeda, th=s is almost certainly correct and reflects a 
change in American thinking a=out the struggle against al-Qaeda that has taken root since the middle of the last decade. 
It is not a significan= departure from current practice, though. The Obama administration's wil=ingness to work with the 
Muslim Brotherhood's elected president of Egypt=demonstrates how far we have come since the feverish days following 
2001 when American commentators lumped togethe= all Islamists into a single, undifferentiated, existential menace. 
If most now agree on the importance of backing the region=92s moderates, no such consensus exists on who they might 
be. The Muslim B=otherhood and similar organizations present the crucial test case for efforts to define the moderates 
with whom we sho=ld align. Rohde views such movements as "not ideal," but "our true e=emies — and theirs — are 
violent Salafist militants." In Tunisia, he=writes, the United States "needs to engage more with Tunisia's Islamists, not 
less." As a strategy for marginaliz=ng the genuine extremists in al-Qaeda and its affiliated movements, this m=kes good 
sense. And his arguments rang true before the Arab Spring, when r=al liberals had to support peaceful Islamists against 
the practices of repressive regimes. 
A good case can be made for Islamist inclusion, since ban=ing major political movements from participating in politics is 
inherently=anti-democratic. But is it equally appropriate today, when such Islamists uneasily rule Egypt and Tunisia 
and=much of the region has become badly polarized over their intentions and be=avior? Do the same rules apply for 
identifying which moderates to support?=Tougher choices must be confronted when Islamists win, and can use their 
power to promote an Islamist agenda =nd frighten their liberal opponents. 
This conceptual challenge cuts to the heart of Rhode's =olicy advice. Are the moderates to be supported found in the 
now-dominant =slamist trends, or among the smaller but more ideologically liberal, entrepreneurial and cosmopolitan 
new gener=tion? In today's deeply polarized environment, few Egyptian liberals vie= the Brotherhood as moderate. 
President Mohamed Morsi has proved disastrou= in power, failing to govern effectively or to build an inclusive process. 
His decision to force through a divisive=constitution last November poisoned an already bitterly divided public. Ma=y 
Egyptian and Tunisian liberals who once fiercely defended the Brotherhoo= against regime repression no longer view its 
members as democrats, as moderates or as legitimate participants =n the political sphere. They would naturally prefer 
that the United States=support their own struggles against their Islamist rivals. 
So, again, which moderates is America to support? Should =ashington back the democratic process in countries such as 
Egypt even when=the deck seems stacked in favor of Islamists with a seemingly illiberal agenda? Who is the moderate 
when Isla=ists call for elections and some liberal icons urge a military coup and el=ctoral boycott while denouncing the 
United States? Are young, cosmopolitan= English-speaking secularists moderate when they battle police, boycott 
elections and decry America? What about U=S. alliances with the region's repressive, conservative monarchies — a=e 
these deeply religious autocracies to be counted among the moderates at = time when they are escalating crackdowns 
on free speech and political dissent? There are no easy answers to these c=mplex, tortured questions, but Rohde largely 
avoids them. 
What about the other major part of his case, moving "be=ond war"? Rohde urges "a more economic and less military-
oriented effo=t [that] will achieve more than the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan did." Amen. But he may have already 
had second t=oughts. Over the past year, he has savaged the Obama administration's strategy as a failure in Syria and 
has demanded that it do more to arm rebels=against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and seize a "strategic 
opportunity to weaken Iran and Hezbollah=" The temptations of military action in support of liberal values are no= so 
easily cast aside, it seems, even in a book that explicitly sets out t= get the United States "beyond war" in the Middle 
East.
