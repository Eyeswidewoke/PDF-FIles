aversion and high volatility. However, these negative 
factors are also increasingly well-appreciated by 
markets, and arguably better reflected in valuations. 
This suggests that a singular focus on external 
vulnerabilities may not be a consistent way to make 
money in Asia this year. irvi(

Where are the relative weak links in Asia FX on these 
metrics? Based on a simplified measure of output gaps.

(Chart 4). The underperformance is 
starkest in China and Indonesia, but also affects a 
majority of developed North Asia (Singapore, Korea, 
Taiwan). The weakness in growth profiles should mean 
central banks remain dovish here. Another deterrent to 
Asia raising rates is the additional interest burden on 
households it would impose In the QE years of low 
interest rates, many Asian economies saw a large run-
up in household debt levels. The largest jumps took 
place in Singapore. Thailand and Malaysia. In Korea 
and Taiwan, outstanding debt levels were already high 
pre-crisis. Altogether, five major Asian economies now 
have household debt between 60-90% of GDP. 
The transmission mechanism of internal vulnerabilities 
to currency markets, we believe, oil! 
through the rate differential channel where narrowing 
spreads between Asian and US rates will be magnified 
by Fed hikes. We find that the

TWD. CNY. MYR and KRW. In other words, if rates in 
these markets rise less than the US (or indeed fall even 
as US rates rise), compressing the rate differential, this 
is likely to be associated with weaker local currencies. 
The relationship is not as instructive for INR and PHP 
and is in fact inverted for SGD and IDR, where 
narrower rate differentials are associated with stronger 
currencies. For Singapore, this is a function of her 
currency-based policy framework which imposes 
uncovered interest parity: an appreciating SGD NEER 
pushes SGD rates below basket rates, and vice versa. 
While in Indonesia, we suspect this inversion captures 
the fact that the bond-FX relationship is dominated by 
foreign flows and credit concerns: offshore flows and 
lower risk premium drives lower local currency rates. 
but this is good for IDR. 
While the externally still vulnerable MYR and IDR will 
continue to come under most pressure during stress 
periods; outside of these windows, USD strength could 
rotate more towards internally vulnerable currencies 
like KRW, 1VVD, CNY and THB from here. 
Trades: 
Buy USD versus KRW (target 1300). TWO 
(target 35) and THB (target 40).
