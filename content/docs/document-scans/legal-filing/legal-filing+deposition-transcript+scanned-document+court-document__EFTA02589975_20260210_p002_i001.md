what would be left in the budget. This can be done without Arcom approval as I have previously been advised by town. I 
have asked for Canon's estimate by tomorrow. =/u> 
5. Slippery Dock. This was not on=my list. Since last weekend, two contractors haverecommend against adding 
non stick strips to the dock. They walked the dock in the rain yesterday and ac=ually recommend doing nothing. If I 
insist, they suggest repainting the dock with=a "tough coat" finish but this will result in a painted dock. Pleas= note that 
the neighboring docks (except the cement ones) are finished like =ur dock. They think the strips will be relatively 
expensive ($5000 to$10,000) =nd will be unattractive. I will do whatever JEE prefers.<=div> 
6. Entry Appearance Issues.rJEE wishes to make changes to make the house more important-appearing from the 
street. Th= ficus arch will be cut away immediately. (I have thought about this in the =ast but here has been divided 
opinion on this because some find it a charming element but I take your point about hiding the importance of the house. 
) T=is will be done by Robens and his helper within a few days. His will make the house more visible. Secondly, there are 
existing 6' gate posts hidd=n by the ficus arch. Jackie Albarran was at the house (She is an architect-see above= this 
morning and will suggest a solution (possibly making these 2' talle= to 8'as allowed by code) to help make the entry 
more impressive. Adding gates would require a variance because of setback issues. No other house on the street has a 
working gate. 
7. The central palm tree in the <r>front parking court. Workers have knocked the light at the base of the tree 
d=wn several times which raises the question of whether the tree should be remov=d. We had it fertilized this summer 
with the intent of keeping it but it does mak= maneuvering the parking court more difficult. What is your opinion? The 
pla= is to gravel the drive as a last item. (Gravel is relatively inexpensive, attractive looking and architecturally 
appropriate.)</riv> 
8. Inside the house the disuse= furniture will be removed immediately. Most of the furniture I am lendi=g (some 
is already there) wont be delivered until the painting is completed. I have=been working with Ron Shaffer (interior 
designer/Farrow & Ball stockist) on colors, papers and design. Ron also recommended the painter who runs a crew=for 
Gary York. We have been doing very well on a time and materials basis with = im. The first floor is painted and the 
painters are now working on trim and two selected bedrooms upstairs now. He and his crew (a varying few painters) 
co=e at 4 and work late and on weekends. There are also a powder room and one bedroom to be papered. Paint and 
paper are at the house. We are pressuring =he painter to complete asap. 
9. The refacing of the kitchen cabine=s. Canon is doing this work for 56000. We chose just to reface because the 
cabinets are attractive and unobjectionable and to replace them is a substantial expense. Plus redoing kitchens is viewed 
as a commonplace by bu=ers 
10. The last pieces are the roof =534,000) and the graveling of the parking court (a few loads- probably under 
$7500). Note- the roof is not leaking but ageing. I thought it better to replace the roof just to have it off the table but 
this could be eliminated because it should pass inspection as is. 
11. Ruined balusters. There are remnants of old balusters hidden in and peaking out of the hedges. These are 
nonfunctional and, if removed, would n=t be replaced. I thought they were 
a character element. If JEE prefers, I will 
have them removed. =/span> 
12. To repeat, I appreciate the offer of=Janusz' help. I will put Janusz and Albert in touch. Perhaps Janusz coud 
work o= the exterior, lower level, north side utilty closets, cleaning them and possibly putting a coat of shiny garage 
paint on them as one item. 
13. Photos. By Friday I will send=newly taken photos of the areas in JEE's photos showing the corrective 
me=sures. 
14. Occupancy. No one has spent a=night in that house except, and I very much regret this, Carmo who spent 
about 8 =ays there which was the outside of how long he said he would be there. No one i= staying there now. Painters 
are inside and working most evenings. There is =o tv or phone. 
</rpan> 
Albert Ca=o, the current property manager for Steve Ross and former for Stu Subotnick ,is managing most of the 
work. = speak to him daily and text and email him more frequently. The s</=ont>ame is true for Ron Shaffer who is 
working on the interior.We are using the same contractor currently renovating Steve's house and many of the same
