of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company. The matters discussed

Legal 
There are asserted claims against the Company where an unfavorable outcome is considered to be reasonably passible. These claims can 
generally be categorized in the following areas: (1) patent infringement which results from claims that the Company is using technolog that has 
been patented by another party; (2) merchant customer matters often associated with alleged In oussing errors or disclosure issues and claims that 
one of the subsidiaries of the Company has violated a federal or state requirement regarding credit reporting or collection in connection with its 
check verification guarantee, and collection activities; and (3) other matters which may include issues such as employment. The Company's 
estimates of the possible ranges of losses in excess of any amounts accrued arc $0 to $50 million for patent infringement, $0 to $15 million for 
merchant customer matters, and SO to $40 million for other matters, resulting in a total estimated range of possible losses of $0 to $105 million for 
all of the matters described above. 
The estimated range of reasonably possible losses is based on information currently available and involves elements of judgment and 
significant uncertainties. As additional information becomes available and the resolution of the uncertainties becomes more apparent, it is possible 
that actual losses may exceed even the high end of the estimated range.

for cash consideration as well as contingent payments for achievement of certain milestones. As part of the purchase price, the Company recorded a 
$29 million liability for the contingent consideration, of which $1 million was paid during the six months ended Junc 30. 2015 and $28 million 
remained accrued as of June 30, 2015. This fair value measurement represents a Level 3 measurement as it is based on significant inputs not 
observable in the market. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date. The 
primary assumption is the estimated number of merchant locations that will be using the software or technology in the next three years.
