travels through it. This allows one to abstract the spacetime geometry away from the detailed his-
tory of the particles whose interactions actually define it. This abstraction results in the geometry 
of Minkowski spacetime. 
However this abstraction leads to a conceptual tension, arising from a conflict between the 
interpretation of Minkowski spacetime in special and general relativity. Einstein tells us that in 
special relativity the points of Minkowski spacetime are operationally defined as arising from 
the coincidence of physical particles. But in general relativity, Minkowski spacetime is a vacuum 
solution, corresponding to a limit in which all matter has been removed from spacetime. The 
usual resolution of this tension is to regard special relativity only as an approximation to general 
relativity, which more fully realizes the principle that spacetime is relational. 
One can ask whether this tension could also arise in the context of a quantum gravity theory. It 
is then interesting to note that it not possible to completely abstract the spacetime geometry from 
the motions and interactions of particles in tr-Minkowski spacetime. As we have seen, the lorentz 
transformations (6,7) and translations (22) of the coordinates of an event depend on the energy 
and momentum of the particles whose intersection defines the event. 
Indeed, hidden in the form of the energy and momentum dependence of (6,7) and (22) is a 
question, what energy and momenta are involved here? From the context in which these formulas 
are derived[23, 24] the answer is dear, these transformations apply to the phase space of a free 
relativistic particle, whose coordinates and momenta and energy are always defined. But this 
answer raises a further question: can we abstract from the phase space description of a free particle 
to a universal description of a spacetime geometry that is independent of the particular particles 
traveling through it? To do this we would need a formula for lorentz transformations of events 
that do not depend on particular properties of the particles whose motion and interaction defines 
that event. Without this there can be no abstraction to an empty spacetime geometry from the 
phase space description of a relativistic particle. 
Of course such formula are available, by taking the formal limit in which IpElh -> 0 one 
returns to the description in special relativity. However, looking at (6,7) and (22) we see that the 
relevant limit is really of the form IpxElh —> 0. This is non-uniform in space, hence for a given 
scale of energy it can only be taken within an horizon in which lxi is not too large. This is how 
the limitations of the extent of inertial coordinates we have just discussed arises. It is a limit to 
the region within in which one can abstract from the phase space a particle to get an independent 
notion of spacetime geometry, in which events are defined without regard to the particles whose 
interactions define them. if we don't take the limit IpxElh -> 0 then there is no notion of the 
coordinates of an event that does not carry with it, coded into its transformation properties, a 
record of the energy and momentum of the particles whose interaction defined it. That is, there 
simply are no events without particles. 
Hence, the ambiguities in coordinates of events we have discussed here can be seen in a new 
light, they indicate that in quantum gravity we have to take seriously the notion that spacetimes 
are constructed to represent relations amongst physical events involving physical particles. There 
is in general no abstraction which yields an empty spacetime geometry, in which events are de-
fined without reference to the particles that operationally defined them. 
Mathematically, these ambiguities reflect the uncertainty relation (28) arising from the commu-
tation relations (3). These formulas are also indications of the basic lesson that in any experimental 
situation in which quantifies of the order of /pErlh cannot be neglected there is a fundamental 
limit to the use of the notion of a spacetime geometry abstracted from the network of causal inter-
