LIBOR rates for personal and institutional profit and the mis-selling of payments insurance and 
interest rate hedges for small businesses. But also fundamental questions over the bank's business 
model, the way it rewards its highest earners including Mr Diamond himself, its approach to its own 
tax affairs and the 'aggressiveness' of the tax services it provides to clients, irrespective of their 
legality. In this, obviously Barclays is far from alone. 
Politicians are at something of a loss as to how concretely to address these issues of values and 
character and this poses a particular challenge for banks. Culture is hard to regulate and the public 
have no real appetite or patience for reassurances that a renewed rigour from supervisors will fix 
the problem. The proxies for culture are going to be pay and senior accountability, and these are the 
two things that ultimately tripped up Mr Diamond at Barclays. Although many in banking would like 
to argue that these things are beside the point, politically they are the point. 
Like much else in the current banking model, the case for remuneration levels in banking is based 
purely on the logic and discipline of the free market for financial services. Yet the bailouts of 2008 
and the LIBOR-fixing scandal have further exhausted political and regulatory patience with the idea 
that banking exists in a free market. High levels of remuneration are also glaringly at odds with the 
wider economic context and the prevailing political climate. George Osborne, the British Chancellor, 
has tried to accommodate London-based investment banks by resisting the rather rigid rules 
inserted at the last minute by the European Parliament into the European CRD4 Directive applying 
ratios for fixed and bonus pay at European banks. But in doing so he is well aware that he is badly 
out of step with the public mood. 
The accountability problem is as simple and blunt as politics gets. The massive market disruptions of 
2008 and the ensuing economic crisis have created a latent political desire for personal 
accountability from the banking industry that it has so far been unable to meet. In part this is 
because the most egregiously managed institutions in the period leading up to 2008 have simply 
disappeared. The survivors are generally not inclined to feel implicated in the industry's wider 
collective problems. Mr Diamond always seemed to hint at the indignation of an executive whose 
bank had survived the banking crisis without direct government support and who felt he had little to 
answer for, at least until his employees' malpractice made this untenable. This is part of what made 
him such a lightning rod and figure of resentment for many politicians. 
The political fallout 
How will this play out politically? The UK's Labour opposition has clearly judged that there is 
mileage in a renewed campaign against the bankers. However, although Labour supports a 
tightening of the government's proposed rules on derivatives inside the ringfence for British retail 
banks proposed for 2013, its ultimate aim is not a particular regulatory outcome but something 
closer to a moral posture on capitalism. Labour leader Ed Miliband has broadly disowned the 
banking record of the labour government before 2010 and has put a "better, improved capitalism" 
at the heart of his election platform. This is achieving some resonance in the media. His aim is to 
use a moral and ethical critique of banking as a way of differentiating himself and the Labour party 
both from its own past and the Conservative-led Coalition government. The Coalition government 
inevitably will be forced to cover the same ground. 
The Conservative party is much less inclined to make a moral issue of banking, still less of capitalism 
more widely. However, most of the very small number of genuinely forensic critics of the banking 
sector in the UK Parliament are Tories, and often individuals with financial services backgrounds. 
The Chancellor George Osborne currently seems more inclined to use the LIBOR issue as an 
opportunity to attack Labour's record in government, but if other banks are fined and the 
Parliamentary enquiry is highly critical, then he will have to tack to stay close enough to the public 
mood. His own backbenchers have already started to grumble that he has misjudged the LIBOR 
scandal by playing it for politics rather than a question of principle and policy.
