will offer the additional shares on the same terms as those on which the shares are being offered.

issued to and accepted by them, subject to approval of certain legal matters by counsel for the 
underwriters and the satisfaction of other conditions contained in the underwriting agreement,

• there is no material adverse change in the financial markets or in our business; and 
• we deliver customary closing conditions. 
The underwriters propose to offer shares of our common stock directly to the public at the initial 
public offering price per share on the cover of this prospectus and to certain dealers at that price less a 
concession not in excess of 
per share. After this offering, the offering price and other selling 
terms may be changed by the underwriters. The underwriters reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or 
modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part. Sales of shares made outside of the 
United States may be made by affiliates of the underwriters. The representatives have advised us that 
the underwriters do not intend to confirm discretionary sales in excess of 5% of the shares of our 
common stock offered in this offering.
