property, states in part: 'Moneys, credits, securities and other intangible personal property within the state 
not employed in carrying on any business therein by the owner shall be deemed to be located at the domicile 
of the owner for purposes of taxation (italics added]." 
In other words, the opinions reflect Tax Department policy that doesn't necessarily square with the literal 
language of the underlying law. Stated differently, the opinions are designed to have a chilling effect, and 
seem to represent New York's litigating position — namely, that a single member LLC/disregarded entity 
holding New York real estate will not insulate that real estate from New York estate tax at the non-resident 
owner's death. This is a point that a wealthy non-resident decedent's estate might be willing to contest. 
Nevertheless, that same non-resident might prefer to avoid the issue entirely, and perhaps buy a cooperative 
apartment instead (a co-op is intangible property), or seek a more complex ownership structure for the 
condo.
