computer. Allen bought the magazine, rushed =over to Gates' dorm, and showed it to him. "Look!" Allen said. "It's going 
to happen! I told you this was going to happen! And we're going to miss it!" 
They called Ed Roberts, the man who created the Altair, and told him that they had written a version of a programming 
language called basic for his computer. That wasn't true. It was an early use of a now common strategy in the computer 
industry, and at Microsoft in particular: announcing products that don't exist (known in =the industry as "vaporware") in 
order to discourage possible competitors. After talking to Roberts, Bill and Paul went on an eight-week code-writing 
binge, with Gates writing most of the code, often falling asleep at the keyboard, dreaming in code, waking up, and 
=immediately starting to write code again, with no real transition between dreaming and waking-just code. ("It was the 
coolest program I ever wrote," Gates later said.) At the end of the eight weeks, Allen flew out to Albuquerque, met with 
Roberts, loaded the software into the =Altair, and typed "print 2 + 2." The Altair spat out "4." The program worked. 
By the end of 1975, Gates and Allen had founded a company, Micro-soft, to sell their basic. (The hyphen was dropped a 
few =years later.) Now came what is perhaps the pivotal moment in the early =history of the software industry. 
Computer hobbyists who had bought the =Altair were dismayed to find that it didn't come with the software to operate 
it, and were even more dismayed when they learned that they had =to buy the software for four hundred and fifty 
dollars from Micro-soft. =/p> 
At that time, no one thought of software as something you paid for. Software was just rolls of paper tape with little 
holes punched in it. A hacker would write a cool piece of software for fun, copy it, and give it away to his friends. Altair 
owners began to do the same thing with Micro-soft's basic. Then, in February of 1976, Gates published "An Open Letter 
to Hobbyists" in the =Altair newsletter, and the letter now stands as a sort of Magna Carta of the software industry--the 
underpinning of the intellectual--property =structure. It stated, "As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most =of 
you steal your software," and went on to argue that software was just as much a commodity as hardware, because it 
represented someone's intellectual work, and that the creators of the software should be compensated just as creators 
of hardware were. 
Gates shuttled between Harvard and Albuquerque until the start of his senior year, when he dropped out for good. The 
business expanded, and he and Allen relocated it to Seattle in 1978. In =1980, I.B.M. approached Gates to write an 
operating system for the personal computer it was designing, the I.B.M. PC. Gates flew down to Florida to meet the 
I.B.M. executives working on the project, realized =on the way that he had forgotten to bring a tie, and drove around 
looking for a place to buy one. The I.B.M. executives, who had never laid eyes on Gates, were stunned to see that their 
prospective partner =looked exactly like one of the hackers they were beginning to read about in the press. They told 
Gates they needed an operating system in three =months--an impossibly short time--and Gates accepted the job. Upon 
returning to Seattle, he bought an operating system called qdos, which =was short for Quick and Dirty Operating System, 
from another software developer, Seattle Computer, for around seventy-five thousand dollars, =renamed it ms-dos, and, 
in a three-month code-writing marathon, converted it to I.B.M.'s specifications. 
Software is sometimes said to be to the age of information as oil was to the age of the machine. Software is what makes 
information systems operate. Software is like a natural resource, except that its source is not in the earth but in the 
human mind: people carry pools of software in their heads. Its lack of physical existence =makes its importance easy to 
underestimate. I.B.M., which was one of the great business organizations in history, and which was perfectly placed to 
own the personal-computer business, disastrously failed to appreciate the importance of the software Gates designed 
for it. Because I.B.M. thought that the money was going to be in the hardware, in the =computers themselves, it allowed 
Gates to retain the rights to ms-dos. =During the nineteen-eighties, the PC was cloned by other American manufacturers 
and by the Japanese, who could make and sell the machines =more cheaply than I.B.M. could, but no one knew how to 
clone ms-dos, and Bill Gates collected a fee for every PC and every PC clone sold in the =world. 
Two books about the fall of I.B.M. and Gates' role in it have recently appeared--"Big Blues," by Paul Carroll, and 
"Computer Wars," by Charles H. Ferguson and Charles R. Morris--and an occasional chill runs up the spine of anyone 
reading them at the ease with which Gates eviscerated men much older and more experienced than he was. "I kept 
wanting to say to Cannavino, 'We need a shorthand because =these meetings are taking too long,' " Gates says in "Big
