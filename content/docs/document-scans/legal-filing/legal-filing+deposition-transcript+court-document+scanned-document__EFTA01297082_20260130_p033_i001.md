articulated in Court. As a rloi result, the Court entered an Order on November 4, 2013 
that incorporated the negotiated terms which the parties stipulated to on the record in the 
September 10, 2013 hearing. On November 18, 2013, this Court entered an Order which 
granted a Motion to Amend filed by Dr. Wright-Francis. The Order amended the previous 
November 4, 2013 Order which instructed Mr. Francis to pay his settlement amount by 
certified check or bank draft instead of transferring the sum from his retirement account 
directly to Dr. Wright-Francis' account or to her personally by electronic means. Mr. 
Francis objected to Dr. Wright-Francis' method of payment request, filed a timely 
opposition on November 20, 2013, and requested the Court to reconsider its Amended 
Order entered on November 18, 2013.11

days before the fourteen (14) day statutory period for Mr. Francis to respond ended. pursuant to Rule 15(b)(3) of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure. Mr. Francis Ned his opposition to the Motion to Amend on November 20. 2013. 
[**21] Having reviewed the parties conflicting requests, the Court vacated its November 
18, 2013 Order because it found that the parties' settlement rig agreement lacked 
mutual assent since the parties could not agree on the method of payment. The parties 
also claimed that they would incur injury if payment was not made as each requested. The 
Court determined that the parties negotiated and accepted the agreement based on two 
(2) different interpretations of its terms. As a result, this matter was scheduled for trial. 
Subsequently, Mr. Francis moved the Court on February 12, 2014 for permission to return 
to the marital homestead since his existing apartment poorly accommodated him and his 
daughter for their monthly visitation and Dr. Wright-Francis had recently purchased 
property on St. Thomas.

expenses without any contribution from Dr. Wright-Francis and continues to pay those 
expenses. He also claims that he has made payments on the balance owed to Balbo for 
construction work on IB-29 Estate Solberg.

listed on the document ri2] as "Borrower? 
Mr. Francis seeks a portion of Dr. Wright-Francis' current and future earnings since he 
claims that he supported her financially while she completed medical school in 1992. As a 
result, Mr. Francis asserts that Dr. Wright-Francis' medical license is marital property 
which is divisible like the parties' other assets.

Hundred Three Thousand, Eight Hundred Fifty Seven Dollars and Twenty Four Cents
