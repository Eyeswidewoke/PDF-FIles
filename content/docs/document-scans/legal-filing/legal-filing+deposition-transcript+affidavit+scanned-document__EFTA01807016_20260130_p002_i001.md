between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Chancellor Angela Merkel at a time when relations are otherwise 
thought to be tense, according to a veteran diplomat involved in the deal. 
Two new German-made Dolphin submarines are expected to cross the Mediterranean and join the Israel Navy's fleet 
within the next two years, under a deal reached previously between Israel and Germany. This Wednesday, after 
numerous stops and starts, another agreement was reached, whereby Germany will pay for one-third of the production 
costs of a third submarine, which is estimated at $400 million. 
Present at the signing of the agreement in Berlin on Wednesday - along with Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Israeli 
Ambassador to Germany Yaakov Hadas - was Yoram Ben Zeev, the ambassador's predecessor in Berlin, who only 
recently left the German capital. Ben Zeev recalls numerous obstacles over the years that threatened to thwart the 
agreement. 
At 67, Ben Zeev is a veteran diplomat who served for 40 years in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He took up his position 
in Berlin at the start of 2008 after more than a decade working in the United States - first as the consul in Los Angeles 
and later as head of the North America desk. During the years of the Oslo Accords, Ben Zeev was the coordinator of the 
peace negotiations on behalf of the Foreign Ministry. He maintained close relations with the German leadership, 
particularly officials in Merkel's bureau. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office at the end of March 
2009, Ben Zeev had already been serving in Berlin for more than a year. 
Netanyahu made his first visit to Berlin in August of that year, but even before he set foot on German soil the 
preparatory talks between his national security advisor, Uzi Arad, and Arad's German counterpart, Christoph Heusgen, 
hit a rocky patch. Arad demanded that the chancellor not bring up the issue of the settlements during the press 
conference after the meeting with Netanyahu. Heusgen rejected this request, and Arad responded by threatening that 
Netanyahu would cancel his visit. 
"You know what? Cancel it," Heusgen reportedly charged back. 
In the end, the visit was not canceled, and at the press conference following the meeting with Netanyahu, Merkel called 
upon Israel to freeze construction in the settlements immediately. 
Despite this tense start, the meeting between Netanyahu and Merkel did prove fruitful, and Israel asked Germany to 
provide a sixth German-made submarine for its navy. 
Germany had already delivered its first three Dolphin submarines to Israel at the end of the 1990s. The German 
government, then headed by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and subsequently by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, funded 
most of their cost. 
Later, under the leadership of former prime ministers Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert, Israel agreed on the acquisition of 
two additional submarines from Germany. These submarines are now being completed and are expected to join the 
Israeli fleet in 2013 and 2014. They are equipped with more advanced systems than their predecessors, and are thus 
able to spend longer periods underwater. 
Germany agreed to pay for one-third of these submarines' production costs - without which Israel would not have been 
able to acquire the advanced submarines. 
Foreign sources report that the German submarines are equipped to carry guided missiles made in Israel, which have a 
range of 1,500 kilometers and can be armed with nuclear warheads. According to these reports, the submarine fleet is 
intended to afford Israel second-strike capability in case of a nuclear attack. At a time when the diplomatic-security 
discourse is focused almost entirely on Iran's attempts to arm itself with nuclear weapons, the importance of the 
submarines is especially clear.
