Signals to Noise (S2N) 
Our key insight on F5 is our higher conviction on the company's next-phase growth 
opportunities in Telco Network Intelligence and Next-Gen Security use cases, as we 
highlight below: 
Telco Network Intelligence: Field color from our MWC industry meetings correlate well 
with our recent round of IT channel conversations - which note that F5's +2 years of 
R&D and sales cycle investment at the major telcos (e.g. Verizon. AT&T. Vodafone, 
Telefonica, etc) on Layer 4/7 network intelligence initiatives is starting to positively 
impact F5's telco sales pipeline. 
While the company noted recent set of LTE signaling and mobile data traffic 
management related design wins at 01 in Latin America and at carriers in the EMEA and 
APAC - our research suggests likely design wins at the large US telcos during 2014 
(e.g. at Verizon, AT&T Domain 2.0, etc) - for LTE Diameter Signaling, LTE Roaming, 
mobile web traffic steering, enforcing BW caps for mobile data plans, mobile network 
firewalls. etc. 
The telco design wins involve a multi-Q sales pipeline for F5's NW platforms such as 
the higher-end BIG-IP 7k/10k series and Viprion, SW modules such as Traffix Diameter 
Signaling, CG-NAT, Local and Global Traffic Management, Policy Enforcement, 
Application and Network Firewalls, Access Policy Management, etc, and pre/post-sales 
telco solutions integration + consulting opportunities. 
F5 has "crossed the chasm" in our view - in terms of being a viable carrier-grade SW 
and HW platform solution for the large telcos - for enabling the mobile operators in 
particular to effectively monetize their LTE data services subscribers - using 
sophisticated usage based charging schemes - and pricing methods for specific 
consumer and business demographics - such as teen-rate plans, corporate plans, etc 
[refer to our recent FITT on Big Data Networking for the SW use cases in network 
intelligence!. 
Driving the demand for F5's layer 4/7 and application-aware service provider network 
intelligence solutions is the carrier industry's imperative around Network Functions 
Virtualization INFVI and "Network Consolidation". 
We plan on a deep-dive follow-on note on the Telco NFV and Network Consolidation 
themes. 
In the context of this note, it is noteworthy to highlight that F5 is seeing opportunities to 
sell its Layer 4/7 network intelligence solutions at the large mobile operators - primarily 
due to the window of opportunity that has opened up for F5 in: 
1. Telco NFV: which involves deploying SW and virtual appliances for Control Plane use 
cases such as LTE Diameter Signaling Routing, LTE Roaming, Usage-Based Mobile 
Data Plans, Web Traffic Steering, etc; 
2 Network Consolidation: Mobile operators, keen on meaningfully improving the 
EBITDA profitability of their LTE mobile data service offerings are looking to consolidate 
multiple legacy network elements (security, policy servers, DPI/analytics, charging 
servers, IPv4/v6 address translation, etc) in the Gi and SGi network - i.e. the network 
segment between the mobile packet core (GGSN/S-GW, etc) and the IP edge router -
using newer technology platforms such as F5's multi Gigabit BIG IP or Viprion ADC 
platforms running multiple SW modules - so as to structurally lower their network cost 
basis and also leverage new application- and web traffic aware network intelligence 
features to implement new usage and traffic based mobile rate plans, etc.
