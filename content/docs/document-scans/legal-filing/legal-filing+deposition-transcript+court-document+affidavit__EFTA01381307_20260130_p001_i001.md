The revenue per pound of the more specialized products (e.g., breed-size specific and hairball management for cats) we 
introduce across our product lines and product types is typically higher than the average revenue per pound of existing 
products in our portfolio. 
As we cross-sell more of our products to our user base and reach more cats where we have lower relative market share, our 
product mix will continue to shift towards wet foods and treats, as well as cat foods overall, which all have higher revenue 
per pound than our overall company average.

• 
Funding growth initiatives with a long-term view. With strong top-line growth, we expect to have significant scale benefits and 
operating leverage in our business in the future. We also expect significant cost savings from in-sourcing a substantial portion of our 
manufacturing with our Heartland facility as well as other facilities we may build or acquire in the future. In the near term, we plan to use 
these increased efficiencies to fund our growth initiatives to reach and feed more pets. 
• 
Growing in select international markets. In 2014, approximately 3% of our sales were from outside the United States. Expanding our 
business in the $49 billion non-U.S. pet food market is an important area of focus for us, as other established premium pet food brands 
generate a significant percentage of their sales from international markets. In 2014, we opened our first office in Canada. where we 
already have a sizable business with an operating margin on par with our business in the United States. We have also recently established 
operating subsidiaries in Mexico and Japan, where we expect to begin marketing our foods through local distribution by the end of 2015. 
We are determined to take a targeted approach to future international expansion. prioritizing sizeable markets with strong potential. 
• 
Building a strong relationship with the veterinary community and entering the Therapeutic (RI) market segment. Veterinarians 
are the most important influencers for pet food selection, with over one in five pet parents choosing their pet food brand based on a 
veterinarian recommendation. We have recently started building a dedicated nat 'anal detailing force to introduce BLUE to the veterinary 
community and help generate recommendations for BLUE products. While this is a significant new investment initiative for us, we 
believe it can be an important part of our go-to-market strategy in the future. We plan to enter the Therapeutic market segment with 
differentiated natural Rx products and believe that we can be a newt disruptive player in this market segment. While we do not expect to 
generate significant revenues from Therapeutic products in the near tenn. we believe they will be synergistic for our relationship with the 
veterinarian community and provide an incremental avenue of future growth.
