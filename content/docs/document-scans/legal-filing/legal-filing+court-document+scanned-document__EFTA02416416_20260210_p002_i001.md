(Conditions), related rules, regulations and policies (Regulations) and any applicable tariffs. 
2. If your carriage is by more than one carrier, different Conditions, Regulations and any applicable 
tariffs may apply for each carrier. 
3. The Conditions, Regulations and any applicable tariffs of each carrier are, by this notice, 
incorporated by reference into and made part of your contract of carriage.

• 
Conditions and limits on the carrier's liability for the bodily injury or death of

5. You can obtain more information about your contract of carriage, and find out how to request a 
copy, at places where transportation on the carrier is sold. Many carriers also have this 
information on their websites. When required by applicable law, you have the right to inspect the 
full text of your contract of carriage at the carrier's airport and sales offices, and upon request, to 
receive a copy by mail or other delivery service from each carrier free of charge. 
6. If a carrier sells air transportation services or checks baggage specifying carriage on another

YOU CANNOT TRAVEL IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ALL REQUIRED TRAVEL DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS 
PASSPORT AND VISA. 
GOVERNMENTS MAY REQUIRE YOUR CARRIER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON OR PERMIT 
ACCESS TO PASSENGER DATA. 
DENIED BOARDING: Flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be 
available on a flight even if you have a confirmed reservation. In most circumstances, if you are denied 
boarding involuntarily, you are entitled to compensation. When required by applicable law, the carrier 
must solicit volunteers before anyone is denied boarding involuntarily. Check with your carrier for the 
complete rules on payment of denied boarding compensation (DBC) and for information on the carrier's 
boarding priorities.
