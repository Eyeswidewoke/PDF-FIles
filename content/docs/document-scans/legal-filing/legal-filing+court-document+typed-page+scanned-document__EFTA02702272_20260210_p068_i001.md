rights of our stockholders and creditors, including the holders of preferred securities who are creditors of ours by 
virtue of the preferred securities guarantee, to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon such 
subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization or otherwise would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's 
creditors, except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. 
The right of creditors of ours, including the holders of preferred securities who are creditors of ours by virtue of 
the preferred securities guarantee, to participate in the distribution of stock owned by us in certain of our 
subsidiaries, including our insurance subsidiaries. may also be subject to approval by certain insurance regulatory 
authorities having jurisdiction over such subsidiaries. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus 
supplement, the preferred securities guarantee does not limit our ability to incur or issue other secured or 
unsecured debt, whether under an indenture or otherwise. 
Our obligations described herein and in any accompanying prospectus supplement. through the preferred 
securities guarantee, the restated trust agreement. the subordinated indenture and any supplemental indentures 
thereto and the expense agreement described below, taken together, constitute a full, irrevocable and 
unconditional guarantee by us of payments due on the preferred securities. No single document standing alone or 
operating in conjunction with fewer than all of the other documents constitutes such guarantee. It is only the 
combined operation of these documents that has the effect of providing a full, irrevocable and unconditional 
guarantee of the trust's obligations under the preferred securities. See "W. It. Berkley Capital Trust III." 
"Description of Preferred Securities." and "Description of Debt Securities." 
Status of the Preferred Securities Guarantee 
The preferred securities guarantee will constitute an unsecured obligation of ours and will rank subordinate 
and junior in right of payment to all other Indebtedness of ours, except those ranking equally or subordinate by 
their terms. (Section 6.2) 
The preferred securities guarantee will rank equally with all other similar preferred securities guarantees 
issued by us on behalf of holders of preferred securities of any trust. partnership or other entity affiliated with us 
which is a financing vehicle of ours. (Section 6.3) The preferred securities guarantee will constitute a guarantee 
of payment and not of collection. This means that the guaranteed party may institute a legal proceeding directly 
against us to enforce its rights under the preferred securities guarantee without first instituting a legal proceeding 
against any other person or entity. (Section 5.4) The preferred securities guarantee will not be discharged except 
by payment of the Guarantee Payments in full to the extent not paid by the trust or upon distribution to the 
holders of the preferred securities of the corresponding subordinated debt securities. The preferred securities 
guarantee does not place a limitation on the amount of additional Indebtedness that may be incurred by us. We 
expect from time to time to incur additional Indebtedness that will rank senior to the preferred securities 
guarantee. 
Payment of Additional Amounts 
We will make all Guarantee Payments pursuant to the preferred securities guarantee without withholding or 
deduction at source for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, fees, duties, assessments or governmental 
charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of a taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision 
or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such taxes, fees, duties, assessments or governmental charges are 
required to be withheld or deducted by: 
• 
the laws, or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder, of a taxing jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein: or 
• 
an official position regarding the application, administration, interpretation or enforcement of any such 
laws, regulations or rulings, including, without limitation, a holding by a court of competent 
jurisdiction or by a taxing authority in a taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof.
