Foreign policy is m=stly hidden: 90 percent of the effort never warrants a sentence in the med=a, even as it is essential 
to American interests. There are nearly 200 cou=tries in the world, but the media only seriously follows about one-tenth 
of them, even as the State Department mu=t conduct daily bilateral relations with almost all of them. And just beca=se a 
country is not in the news does not mean that America's relations wit= it are not complex and fractious. 
Media speculation a=out who will get the first- and second-tier jobs in government is often in=ne because the media

interesti=g and engaging in print and in conversation with who is actually qualified= Here is a list of the real 
qualifications of a top-tier foreign policy pr=fessional: 
He or she has real =dministrative experience. He can manage people and systems -- and get deci=ions implemented fast. 
This kind of experience comes from the world of cor=orations, government and law firms, much less than from the 
world of universities and the media. Academic supe=stars like Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski are famous 
exceptions t= this rule. Think tanks also produce top-tier foreign policy officials, pr=vided such institutions are of a 
basically centrist inclination and are not pushing an ideological agenda= 
Someone who can thi=k functionally in terms of what works, at minimum risk to the public. This=practical, almost 
mathematical bent is in line with a corporate or a hard-=ore, think-tank background. Ronald Reagan was a great 
president in part because he had such men in key positi=ns: Caspar Weinberger as secretary of defense, Frank Carlucci 
as national =ecurity adviser and George Shultz as secretary of state. These were the te=peramentally bipartisan realists 
who were able to practically implement Reagan's conservative agenda. 
Someone who has goo= judgment rather than detailed knowledge of an area. You will have experts=on staff who can 
brief you, but all the expertise in the world won't help =ou in government if your instincts are bad. It is all about the 
genius of temperament rather than the genius =f intellect. Donald Rumsfeld had a first-rate intellect but a third-rate 
t=mperament, at least in his second go-around as secretary of defense under =eorge W. Bush. 
Someone who is able=to make hard decisions <http://us4.account-

w=ekly%2Fpurpose-presidential-debates&url_id=202345&tags=5,33> daily whil= still being able to sleep at night. Unlike 
journalists and intellectuals,=who constantly revise their opinions to suit evolving circumstances, a top=tier government 
official will be dogged for life for decisions made without the benefit of hindsight. He ca= never walk away from them or 
revise them. This is especially true in matt=rs of war and peace, in which he will see his name taken in vain in 
future=libraries full of histories of the period. 
Someone who can mak= decisions based on very partial evidence, because as Kissinger once famou=ly quipped, by the 
time all or most of the facts are in, it is too late to=affect the outcome. The world of government is not the world of 
academia, in which you can hold off publishing a monog=aph for months to add a few more vital footnotes. 
Someone who can mak= decisions based on the greater strategic good rather than based on how he=or she will look on 
the newspaper opinion pages the next day. The worst so=ts of officials are those who crave good publicity. Of course, an 
official has to know how to manage the media= but he must also avoid being captured by it. 
It is not a require=ent, but it certainly helps to be wealthy. Government jobs pay abysmally. =nd because of electronic 
communications, the 24-hour news cycle and so on,=officials work longer hours and are under more stress than ever 
before. Wealth reduces stress, even as it gran=s an official a measure of independence -- from which brave decisions 
migh= sometimes flow. Wealth means an official can quit his government job over=principle anytime he wants. 
Someone without wealth, who needs to perform well in government to make wealth lat=r on, is likely to take fewer risks 
and stand less often on his principles=
