limited Brand=, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenb=rg, who is currently serving 
a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors=in Towers Financial out of $450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epst=in's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to yo=ng women with whom 
he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story=didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains 
a=mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
=br>This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. =ut, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on 
the intriguing fin=ncial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones= different ones. And 
their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from Eng=and have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about Epstei= 
and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who is=she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating 
myself to others—it w=s, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into=the limelight—that I have 
decided to write about this myself. 
after my piece than before it. I kept running into both of them, se=arately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he 
usually has a co=ple of young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a=monarch. "Do they 
speak?" I remember asking him once, nodding =t his lookalike blondes. He laughed. "Not like you,Vicky,R=1; was his 
riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discuss=d math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I h=dn't studied 
math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the Br=tish educational system), I received a package at home via 
messenger. It w=s a book: "Math for idiots." 
So he is not without humor= even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
"Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects," newspaper pu=lisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was 
certainly preaching to the=converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of thi=gs. Just a few moments in 
his company and you know this to be true. 
And Ghislai=e? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. Itc;s almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, th= most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hou=s talking to 
her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passi=nate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent 
weeks at the b=ttom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent m= a DVD of the fish there. Her 
rolodex would blow away almost anyone else&ft=217;s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs'. She is ve=y 
well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate ab=ut Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends. 
Yet, touchingly, w=en she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend,=Ariadne Calvo-Platero, 
(known fondly to her close friends as "the Te=nis Goddess") Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes do=n to 
things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—=hislaine shows her vulnerability.
