Notice of Important Changes to the $200 Airline Fee Credit Terms and Conditions 
We are making certain changes to the Terms and Conditions governing the $200 Airline Fee Credit benefit. Any language in 
the Terms and Conditions contrary to or conflicting with terms amended below is replaced fully and completely. All terms of 
the Terms and Conditions not amended herein remain in full force and effect. We urge you and any Additional Cardmembers 
on your Account to read the below notice carefully and file it in a safe place for future reference. 
$200 Airline Fee Credit Benefit 
Effective immediately, the reference to "December in the sixth sentence of the Terms and Conditions is deleted and replaced 
with "January." The revised Terms and Conditions are shown below in their entirety with this change highlighted in bold for 
clarity. 
"Benefit is available to Consumer and Business Platinum Card' and Centurion's members only. To receive statement 
credits of up to $200 a year toward incidental air travel fees, Card member must enroll and choose a qualifying airline at 
www.americanexoress.com/CentunonAirlineChoice. Only the Basic Card member or Authorized Account Manager(s) on 
the Card account can enroll and select the qualifying airline. Card members who have not chosen a qualifying airline will 
be able to do so at any time. It can take up to 48 hours post enrollment and airline choice for the benefit to be effective. 
Card members who have already selected a qualifying airline will not be able to change their choice until January of each 
calendar year at which time they may change their airline choice for that calendar year. Card members who do not 
change their airline selection will remain with their current airline. Statement Credits: Incidental air travel fees must be 
charged on the enrolled Card account for the benefit to apply. Incidental air travel fees must be separate charges from 
airline ticket charges. Fees not charged by the Card members airline of choice (e.g. wireless internet and fees incurred 
with airline alliance partners) do not qualify for statement credits. Upgrade charges are not deemed to be incidental fees. 
The airline must submit the incidental air travel fees under the appropriate merchant code, industry code, or required 
service or product identifier for the charge to be eligible. Purchases made by both the Basic and Additional Card 
members on the enrolled Card account are eligible for statement credits. Each Card Account is eligible for up to a total of 
$200 a year in statement credits, regardless of the number of Cards on the Account. Please allow 2-4 weeks after the 
qualifying incidental air travel fee is charged to your Card account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the account. 
Card members can call the number on the back of the Card if statement credits have not posted after 4 weeks from the 
date of purchase. Card members are responsible for payment of all charges until the statement credit(s) posts to the 
account. To be eligible for this benefit. Card account(s) must be active and not in default at the time of statement credit 
fulfillment. If a charge for any incidental air travel fee is included in a Pay Over Time feature balance on your Card 
account (for example, Sign & Travel), the statement credit associated with that charge will not be applied to that Pay Over 
Time feature balance. Instead, the statement credit will be applied to your Pay In Full balance. For additional information 
about this benefit, call the number on the back of your Card."
