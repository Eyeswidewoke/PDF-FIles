individual circumstances on which those theories and claims are based; and the extent to 
which the proposed representative rum may face significant unique or atypical defenses 
to her claims." In re Schering Plough Corp. ERISA Litig., 589 F.3d 585, 597-98 (3d Cir. 
2009). 
Plaintiffs' claims, "for settlement purposes only," are identical to the N14 Class claims. ECF 
No. 70 at 22. Plaintiffs represent that 101 Class Members assert that Defendants 
knowingly placed Class Vehicles containing the alleged defect into the stream of 
commerce and refused to honor its warranty obligations" and that "all Class Members 
assert the same or similar legal theories of liability against Defendants." Id. The Court finds 
that the typicality requirement is satisfied. 
4. Adequacy of representation 
The Court must determine whether "the representative parties will fairly and adequately 
protect the interests of the class." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). The Court considers whether 
the Named Plaintiffs have "the ability and the incentive to represent the claims of the class 
vigorously, that [they have] obtained adequate counsel, and that there is no conflict 
between the [Named Plaintiffs'] claims and those asserted on behalf of the class." Hassine 
v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, 179 (3d Cir. 1988). In this case, counsel is adequate. Plaintiffs 
claim that counsel are "exceedingly experienced and competent in complex litigation and 
have an established track record in litigating complex class action suits." risi ECF No. 70 
at 22. As discussed, Plaintiffs' claims are also representative of those of all N14 Class 
members, and Plaintiffs "have no interests antagonistic to the class." Id. at 23. Though the 
Named Plaintiffs stand to recover payments of $4,000 each above the other consideration 
provided in the proposed settlement, thereby out-recovering other Class members, "this 
amount accords with the effort Plaintiff[ s have] taken to purse the class' claims." 
Weissman v. Gutworth, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8543, 2015 WL 333465 at *4 (D.N.J. May 
26, 2015) (Walls, J.). The Court finds that the adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) is 
satisfied. 
5. Rule 23(b)(3) 
Rule 23(b)(3) includes two requirements: that "questions of law or fact common to class 
members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a 
class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the 
controversy." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). The "predominance" requirement demands that 
"proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation." 
Amchem v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 624, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997). "[T]he 
focus of the predominance inquiry is on whether the defendant's conduct was common as 
to all of the class members, and whether all of the class members were harmed by the 
defendant's conduct." Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 298 (3d Cir. 2011). 
As explained, Plaintiffs alleged in their motion for preliminary approval [*20] that 
Defendants installed the defective timing chain tensioner in all N14 Class Vehicles. ECF 
No. 70 at 21. Because the claims of each N14 Class member -- under federal and/or state 
law -- proceed from this common factual nucleus, all of the claims uniformly turn on "(a) 
whether Defendants knew or should have known that the Class Vehicles contained the
