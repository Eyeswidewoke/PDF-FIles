2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
unless the allegations have no possible relation to the controversy and may cause 
prejudice to one of the parties."' (citations omitted)). 
16 "The Court has broad discretion in considering a ("44] motion to strike under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 1210.-
Trecfone Wireless. Inc. v. Access Telecom. Inc.. 642 F. Supp. 2d 1354, 1360 (St. Fla. 2009) (citations omitted). 
In support of their motion to strike the Plaintiff's fraud in the inducement claim, asserted in 
Count VI, the Defendants solely argue that the elements of that claim mirror the elements 
of the Plaintiffs misrepresentation and deceit claims. (Doc. 65 at 16; doc. 67-1 at 5.) The 
Defendants assert no argument that Count VI somehow prejudices the Defendants, that it 
confuses the issues, or that it has no relation to this controversy, (doc. 65 at 16; doc. 67-1 
at 5), and the undersigned's review of Count VI reveals that it does not suffer from those 
flaws. While the undersigned acknowledges that the fraud in the inducement claim is very 
similar to the Plaintiffs misrepresentation and deceit claims," the similarity of claims in the 
TAC does not warrant the drastic remedy sought. Accordingly, the undersigned 
RECOMMENDS that the Defendants' motions to dismiss or strike Plaintiffs fraud in the 
inducement claim be denied.'' 
17 Indeed. la] claim of fraudulent inducement under Alabama law is similar to one of misrepresentation." Whitney Bank v. 
Murphy. Civil Action No. 11-00614-KI340, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40046. 2013 WL 1191235. at '11 (S. D. Ala. Mar. 22 2013). 
18 The undersigned notes that BIC also argues in a single sentence that Plaintiffs t•45) fraud in the inducement claim fails for 
the same reasons that Plaintiffs misrepresentation. suppression and deceit claims are due to be dismissed. (Doc. 65 at 16.) 
However, as discussed herein, the undersigned finds that Plaintiffs misrepresentation, suppression and deceit claims are 
sufficiently stated and are not due to be dismissed. Therefore, the indersigned rejects this undeveloped argument from BIC. 
4. Suppression claims against BIC, BTU and Brito (Count IV). 
The Plaintiff alleges that BIC, BTU and Brito concealed and suppressed material facts in 
violation of section 6-5-102 when they failed to disclose facts "as to (a) the true state of the 
financial condition of Bunkering and BTU and (b) the status of fuel based product serving 
as security or collateral." (Doc. 64, ¶ 74.) Section 6-5-102 provides as follows: 
"Suppression of a material fact which the party is under an obligation to communicate 
constitutes fraud. The obligation to communicate may arise from the confidential relations 
of the parties or from the particular circumstances of the case." § 6-5-102. 'The elements 
of a suppression claim are '(1) a duty on the part of the defendant to disclose facts; (2) 
concealment or nondisclosure of material facts by the p46] defendant; (3) inducement of 
the plaintiff to act; (and] (4) action by the plaintiff to his or her injury."' Freightliner, L.L.C. v. 
Whatley Contract Carriers, L.L.C., 932 So. 2d 883, 891 (Ala. 2005) (quoting Lambert v. 
Mall Handlers Benefit Plan, 682 So. 2d 61, 63 (Ala. 1996)). 
BIC, BTU and Brito have all moved to dismiss the Plaintiffs suppression claim on the 
grounds that there are no allegations supporting a duty to disclose. (Doc. 65 at 12-14; doc. 
67-1 at 1-3.) The undersigned first considers this argument with respect to BIC.
