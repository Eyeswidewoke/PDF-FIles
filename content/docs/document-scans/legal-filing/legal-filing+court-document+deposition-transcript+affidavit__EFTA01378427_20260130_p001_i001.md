2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29508, * 
Plaintiffs served written discovery on the Takata Defendants. The Takata Defendants 
subsequently provided written responses and documents. On February 16, 2009, plaintiffs 
filed their Amended Motion to Compel Discovery as to the Takata Defendants. (D.E. r8] 
167). On March 3, 2009, the Takata Defendants filed their response in opposition to the 
motion. A hearing was held on March 9, 2009, attended by counsel for plaintiffs and the 
Takata defendants. With leave of court, on March 16 and 17, 2009, supplemental briefs 
were filed by the Takata Defendants and plaintiffs, respectively. 
1 At the beginning of the March 9, 2009 hearing, the court ruled that it would not limit discovery based on the Takata 
Defendants argument that the component parts doctrine barred recovery, as a decision on the application of that doctrine has 
not yet been made in this case. Specifically, even assuming the doctrine is applicable in this type of case. the court has not yet 
determined whether the Takata Defendants 'substantially participated" in the integration of the seat belt into the design of the 
2005 GMC Yukon: and will not do so until the parties have had an opportunity to engage in discovery on this issue. Davis v. 
Komatsu America Indus. Corp., 42 S.W.3d 34, 41-42 (Tenn. 2001): see also Davis v. Komatsu American Industries Corp.. 19 
Fed. Appx. 253. 2001 WL 1042229. at '3 (6th Cir. 2001) (reversing order granting summary judgment for parts manufacturer 
r9) because "Davis has produced sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact as to whether Komatsu substantially 
participated in the integration of its press into the press line. whether the integration caused the press line to be defective. and 
whether the defect in the press line caused Davis' injury."). Moreover. because the court is not inclined to stay discovery 
generally until a decision is made on the applicability of the component parts doctrine, the court permitted plaintiffs to obtain 
discovery on all relevant matters and did not limit discovery to the issue of whether or not the Takata Defendants substantially 
participated in the integration of the seat belt restraint system into the Yukon. 
II. ANALYSIS 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1) allows for the discovery of "any matter, not 
privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). 
Relevancy for discovery purposes is construed broadly. Information is discoverable if it is 
"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." Id. "Nevertheless, 
discovery does have 'ultimate and necessary boundaries,"' Miller v. Fed. Express Corp., 
186 F.R.D. 376, 383 (W.D. Tenn. 1999) [*10] (quoting Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. 
Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 351, 98 S. Ct. 2380, 57 L. Ed. 2d 253 (1978)), "and 'it is well 
established that the scope of discovery is within the sound discretion of the trial court."' 
Miller, 186 F.R.D. at 383 (quoting Coleman v. Am. Red Cross, 23 F.3d 1091, 1096 (6th Cir. 
1994)). A court need not compel discovery if "the burden or expense of the proposed 
discovery outweighs its likely benefit." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(iii). 
Interrogatory No. 2.05: A verified supplemental interrogatory response shall be provided 
identifying the documents which have been produced which provide the information 
responsive to this interrogatory (or referencing the February 16, 2009 letter identifying 
those documents if the letter identifies the specific documents which contain all information 
responsive to this interrogatory) and stating that the response is complete. 
Interrogatory No. 2.06: A verified supplemental interrogatory response shall be provided 
identifying the documents which have been produced which provide the information 
responsive to this interrogatory (or referencing the February 16, 2009 letter identifying 
those documents if the letter identifies the specific documents which contain all information 
rig responsive to this interrogatory) and stating that the response is complete. 
Interrogatory No. 2.07: The Motion is passed over, as Takata has agreed to provide a 
supplemental response stating that the information already provided is complete.
