in addition to any other compensation that we and our affiliates receive for the sale of the securities, which creates an 
additional incentive to sell the securities to you. 
• 
UNPREDICTABLE ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES— The 
payout on the securities can be replicated using a combination of the components described in "The estimated value of the 
securities on the Trade Date may be less than the Price to Public." Therefore, in addition to the levels of any Underlying, 
the terms of the securities at issuance and the value of the securities prior to maturity may be influenced by factors that 
impact the value of fixed income securities and options in general, such as: 
the expected and actual volatility of the Underlyings; 
the expected and actual correlation, if any, between the Underlyings; 
the time to maturity of the securities; 
the dividend rate on the equity securities included in the Underlyings; 
interest and yield rates in the market generally; 
investors' expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; 
geopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events that affect the components 
included in the Undedyings or markets generally and which may affect the levels of the Underlyings; and 
our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings. 
Some or all of these factors may influence the price that you will receive if you choose to sell your securities prior to 
maturity. The impact of any of the factors set forth above may enhance or offset some or all of any change resulting from 
another factor or factors. 
• 
NO OWNERSHIP RIGHTS RELATING TO THE UNDERLYINGS- Your return on the securities will not reflect the return 
you would realize if you actually owned the equity securities that comprise the Underlyings. The return on your investment 
is not the same as the total return based on a purchase of the equity securities that comprise the Underlyings. 
• 
NO DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR VOTING RIGHTS— As a holder of the securities, you will not have voting rights or rights 
to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights with respect to the equity securities that comprise the 
Underlyings. 
• 
THE U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE SECURITIES ARE UNCLEAR— There is no 
direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal tax treatment of the securities, and we do not plan to request a 
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the 
securities are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the securities as described in "United 
States Federal Tax Considerations° below. If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment, the tax 
consequences of ownership and disposition of the securities, including the timing and character of income recognized by 
U.S. investors and the withholding tax consequences to non-U.S. investors, might be materially and adversely affected. 
Moreover, future legislation, Treasury regulations or IRS guidance could adversely affect the U.S. federal tax treatment of 
the securities, possibly retroactively. 
Supplemental Use of Proceeds and Hedging 
We intend to use the proceeds of this offering for our general corporate purposes, which may include the refinancing of existing 
debt outside Switzerland. Some or all of the proceeds we receive from the sale of the securities may be used in connection with 
hedging our obligations under the securities through one or more of our affiliates. Such hedging or trading activities on or prior 
to the Trade Date and during the term of the securities (including on any trading day during any Observation Period or any 
calculation date, as defined in any accompanying product supplement) could adversely affect the value of the Underlyings and, 
as a result, could decrease the amount you may receive on the securities at maturity. For additional information, see 
"Supplemental Use of Proceeds and Hedging" in any accompanying product supplement.
