2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40263, * 
3 In light of the substitution of the Trustee. to the extent the present motion seeks summary judgment on the grounds that 
Loadman lacks standing to pursue this action. that portion of the motion is DENIED as MOOT. See Doughtie v. Ashland. Inc.. 
No. 03-2073 Ml/A. 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43549. 2005 WL 1140736 (W.D. Tenn. May 12 2005) (substitution of bankruptcy 
trustee for named plaintiff mooted standing issue). 
B. Factual Background 
In 2007, Loadman became interested in purchasing Allred Metal Stamping Works, Inc. 
("Allred Metal"), a metal stamping business ['5] located in North Carolina. (Doc. No. 37 
[Loadman Dep. April 1, 2011) at 715.) He retained Frank Coco ("Coco") as his financial 
advisor and, in late 2007, they approached Joe Wojtowicz ("Wojtowicz") of Banco about 
obtaining the SBA loans for the purchase. (Id. at 694, 710, 713, 745.) The loans were 
conditioned upon the environmental status of two adjacent parcels of real estate on which 
Allred Metal was located: 1305 Old Thomasville Road ("Old Thomasville Road property") 
and 1990 Bethel Drive ("Bethel Drive property"). As early as January 3, 2008, an 
environmental risk assessment, or Phase I inspection, had indicated there could be 
environmental problems on both properties, requiring a follow-up Phase II assessment. (Id. 
at 723-24, 734, 736.) 
On February 7, 2008, Banco issued a loan prequalification letter to Loadman for an SBA 
real estate acquisition loan. (Id. at 745-46; Doc. No. 35-1 [Loadman Dep. Ex. 
at 331.) 
The letter explained that Loadman's request for financing had been pre-qualified for the 
SBA "504 program." (Doc. No. 37 at 748; Doc. No. 35-1 at 331.) The letter further 
explained that the SBA "504 program" is a co-lending program wherein a lender makes a 
first mortgage, [' 6] and the SBA provides a second mortgage, via the services of a 
Certified Development Company ("CDC"). (Doc. No. 37 at 748-49; Doc. No. 35-1 at 331.) 
The purpose for the CDC's involvement was to work with the lender and the SBA to handle 
the SBA loan application approval and documentation process for the second mortgage to 
the lender. (Doc. No. 37 at 749-50, 755.) Loadman testified he understood the letter was a 
nonbinding proposal, not a commitment to lend, and that it did not contain all of the terms 
and conditions of the loan. (Doc. No. 37 at 755.)4 He accepted the proposal on February 
27, 2008. (Id.; Doc. No. 35-1 at 333.) 
4 The letter states as follows: 
This proposal is for discussion purposes only. It does not represent a commitment to lend on the part of the 
Lender. If the proposal meets with your approval, it is then subject to credit approval by the Lender and the 
SBA. and the execution and delivery of all documents and information required by the Lender and the SBA in 
form and substance satisfactory to the Lender and the SBA 
(Doc. No. 35-1 at 332.) 
In March 2008, Loadman sought alternative financing from another bank because he felt 
Banco was taking too long. (Doc. No. 37 at 717.) ['7] He returned to Banco, however, 
after a conversation with Wojtowicz and Banco's Matthew Putnam ("Putnam"), in which he 
asserts they promised lower interest rates and fees and that the loan would close within 20 
to 30 days. (Id. at 728-30, 764.) Coco, Loadman's financial advisor, participated in that
