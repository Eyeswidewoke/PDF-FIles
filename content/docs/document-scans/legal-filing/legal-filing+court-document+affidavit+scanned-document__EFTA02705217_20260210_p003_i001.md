PMG will use its best efforts, on behalf of Owner, to arrange the most favorable credit terms 
possible with respect to the purchase of any FF&E item. In this respect, Owner agrees to 
cooperate with PMG to provide such credit information and to cooperate concerning the 
preparation of such credit applications and related documents as may be required to apply for 
such terms. In the event Owner or a vendor requires payment terms based upon customary export 
practices, such as the issuance of letters of credit, PMG will assist in the preparation of such 
documents subject to Owner's review and approval.

the following:

submitted to send all confirmations and acknowledgements of such Purchase Orders and signed

signed contracts do not alter the terms of the Purchase Orders and contracts approved and 
submitted; 
b. Review all such acknowledgments, confirmations, contracts and Purchase Orders and/or 
Change Orders for accuracy as to quantities and conformance with approved specifications;

logistics support on all orders as may be necessary, appropriate, and feasible, to reduce shipping 
costs. (It should be noted that PMG bids out logistics, shipping, freight forwarding services in 
order to further ensure that Owner is obtaining the best services at the lowest costs in all areas of 
the FF&E process).
