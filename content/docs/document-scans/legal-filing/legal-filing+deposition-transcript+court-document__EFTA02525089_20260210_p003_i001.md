distorting the circles, and probably relaxing =he discretization by increasing the resolution. The frequency of the wavel=t 
oscillation is inversely related to how fast it can travel.

> An observer will always have to be implemented as a stable system capa=le of state change, i.e. as a system of vortices 
that interact in such a w=y that they form a multistable oscillator that can travel in unison. From =he perspective of the 
observer, time is observed rate of state change in i=s environment, and it depends on its own rate of change, which in 
turn dep=nds on the speed of the observer. This gives rise to relativistic time. Al=o, the observer does not perceive itself 
as being distorted, but it will n=rmalize itself, and instead perceive its environment around itself as bein= distorted. As a 
result, the observer will always have the impression to t=avel exactly in the middle of its light cone. This model seems to 
recover =orentz invariance, but with a slight catch: it seems to me that while spee= of light is constant and there is no 
preferred frame of reference wrt acc=leration, the resolution of the universe changes with the speed of the obs=rver. No 
idea if this is a bug or a feature, or if it will be neutralized =y something I cannot see yet before I have a proper 
simulation.

many features like simultane=ty etc. will work out, but I don't yet know if a proper numeric simula=ion will indeed work 
as neatly as I imagine.
