Now the set of Lorentz boosts is in this case 3 dimensional, one for the single boost parameter, 
and two for the origin around which the boost is made. However of the two degrees of freedom 
that come from translating the boosts, we have already seen from (38) that only one comes into 
the energy dependence of the Lorentz transformations. So we have four equations to solve with 
two parameters. (The freedom to choose the ra is taken into account here by the fact that there are 
generic intersection points of each pair we are trying to bring together at one event.) 
So the question is, can the four equations that represent the coincidence of the three intersec-
tion points be generated from a generic point by the two degrees of freedom of Lorentz boosts. 
The answer is generically no. That is, consider a generic history with three worldlines that meet 
in pairs. This is a six dimensional set. They cannot be all brought to an element of the two di-
mensional set where all three coincide at a single point by a three parameter family of Lorentz 
boosts. 
So we see that even in d = 1 dimensions having three pc-intersecting worldlines are a non-
generic set of measure zero. 
There is another way to see this. If we look at (37) for d = 1 we see that the term in Li drops out 
and there is just the ordinary Lorentz transformation, which is not energy dependent. The only 
energy dependence in the Lorentz transformations is the term (81) we have already talked about. 
So consider three generic worldlines, which intersect in pairs to give three intersection points. 
The only thing that the energy dependence of the Lorentz transformations can do is to move the 
three worldlines up or down by (81). The three worldlines move by different amounts due to the 
different Ea's, but all three are determined by one parameter which is co • a. The condition that the 
three intersection points shrink to one is four equations, but one only has a single parameter to 
tune to satisfy them. Generically there will be no choice of co • a that reduces the three intersection 
points to a single triple intersection point. 
5.3 Stars and so forth 
One might worry that the non-localities inherent in DSR theories will change the bulk properties 
of large collections of matter such as stars in a way that causes our observations of them to disagree 
with theory11. That is, even if x-intersecting triples of worldlines are rare, there are so many triples 
of atoms in stars that some of them will be sometimes x-local, so some s -local interactions will take 
place. 
Let us grant this for the moment. The problem is, how this is to be observed? A star is al-
ready in thermal equilibrium from a myriad of local interactions. These have mainly the effect of 
reproducing the thermal distribution of the atoms in the star, which means they are completely 
randomized. If we throw in a small proportion of non-local interactions this is not going to have 
a measurable effect on the state of thermal equilibrium. Since the it-local interactions are, by the 
postulate of observer independence, of the same kinds as local interactions, nothing is going to 
happen that doesn't already happen much more numerously with local interactions. They are 
not going to change the temperature, pressure or equation of state of the interior of the star by a 
measurable amount. 
There are in fact models of statistical mechanical systems on lattices that are modified by the 
addition of a small number of non-local interactions[24]. There are observable effects when the
