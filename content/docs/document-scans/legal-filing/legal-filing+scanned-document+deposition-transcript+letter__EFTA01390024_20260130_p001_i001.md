of default risk and may be less liquid than higher-rated bonds. These securities may be subject 
to greater price volatility due to such factors as specific corporate developments, interest rate 
sensitivity, negative perceptions of junk bonds generally. and less secondary market liquidity. 
This potential lack of liquidity may make it more difficult for a Fund to accurately value these 
securities. In the event that a Fund disposes of a portfolio security after it is downgraded. the 
Fund may experience a greater loss than if such security had been sold prior to the downgrade. 
Interest Rate Risk. The values of debt instruments held by a Fund may fall in response to 
increases in interest rates. In general, the values of debt securities fall in response to increases 
in interest rates, and rise in response to decreases in interest rates. The value of a security 
with a longer duration will be more sensitive to increases in interest rates than a similar 
security with a shorter duration. Duration is a measure of the expected life of a bond that is 
used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. For 
example, the price of a bond fund with an average duration of three years generally would be 
expected to fall approximately 3% if interest rates rose by one percentage point. Inverse 
floaters, interest-only and principal-only securities are especially sensitive to interest rate 
changes, which can affect not only their prices but can also change the income flows and 
repayment assumptions for those investments. Adjustable rate instruments also react to 
interest rate changes in a similar manner, although generally to a lesser degree (depending, 
however, on the characteristics of the reset terms, including the index chosen, frequency of 
reset and reset caps or floors, among other things). Given the current historically low 
interest rate environment, risks associated with rising rates are heightened. 
If interest rates rise, repayments of principal on certain debt securities. including loans, may 
occur at a slower rate than expected and the expected length of repayment of those securities 
could increase as a result (i.e.. extension risk). Securities that are subject to extension risk 
generally have a greater potential for loss when prevailing interest rates rise, which could cause 
their values to fall sharply. Prepayment risk results from borrowers paying debt securities prior 
to their maturity date. When a prepayment happens. all or a portion of the obligation will be 
prepaid. A borrower is more likely to prepay an obligation which bears a relatively high rate of 
interest. This means that in times of declining interest rates. a portion of a Fund's higher 
yielding securities are likely to be pre-paid and the Fund will probably be unable to reinvest 
those proceeds in an investment with as high a yield. A decline in income received by a Fund 
from its investments is likely to have a negative effect on the yield and total return of the 
Fund's shares. 
Swaps. Investments in swaps involve the exchange by a Fund with another party of all or a 
portion of their respective interests or commitments. In the case of currency swaps. a Fund 
may exchange with another party their respective commitments to pay or receive currency. 
Use of swaps subjects a Fund to risk of default by the counterparty. If there is a default by the 
counterpart), to such a transaction, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the 
agreements related to the transaction. There are currently a large number of banks and 
investments banking firms acting both as principals and agents and utilizing standardized swap 
documentation. As a result, swap markets are generally relatively liquid in comparison with the 
market for other similar instruments that are traded in the interbank market. In times of 
market turmoil, however, spreads can widen substantially and these markets can become very 
illiquid with the result that positions may not be able to be offset or closed out at a reasonable 
price, if at all. 
A Fund may also enter into currency. interest rate, total return or other swaps that may be 
surrogates for other instruments such as currency forwards and interest rate options.
