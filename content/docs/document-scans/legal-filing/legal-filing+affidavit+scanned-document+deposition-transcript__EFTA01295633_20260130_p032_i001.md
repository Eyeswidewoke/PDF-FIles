requirement. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. Thus, a class-wide proceeding must be able to 
generate common answers that drive the litigation. Id.; see also Jimenez v. Allstate Ins. 
Co., 765 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir. 2014) (observing that "a class meets Rule 23(a)(2)'s 
commonality requirement when the common questions it has raised are apt to drive the 
resolution of the litigation, no matter their number' (internal quotation marks omitted)). For 
a claim based on discrimination in employment decisions, "[w]ithout some glue holding the 
alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it will be impossible to say that 
examination of all the class members' claims for relief will produce a common answer to 
the crucial question why was I disfavored." Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552 (emphasis 
omitted); see also Scott v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 733 F.3d 105, 113 (4th Cir. 2013). 
The workers here most generally present two such common contentions capable of class-
wide answers under Title VII. Under a disparate treatment theory, the common contention 
is that Nucor engaged in a pattern or practice of unlawful discrimination against black 
workers in promotions decisions. See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 336. Under the workers' 
disparate impact theory, the common contention r*33] is that a facially neutral promotions 
policy resulted in a disparate racial impact. See Griggs, 401 U.S. at 429-31. As Wal-Mart 
observed, however, semantic dexterity in crafting a common contention is not enough. 
Commonality instead "requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members 'have 
suffered the same injury[.]"' Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 
157). As such, a court must examine whether differences between class members impede 
the discovery of common answers. Id. at 2551. 
[FIN16) In the absence of a common job evaluation procedure, Wal-Mart held that 
statistical proof of employment discrimination at the regional and national level, coupled 
with limited anecdotal evidence from some states, was insufficient to show that the 
company maintained a "general policy of discrimination" present in each store where class 
members worked. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2553. Similarly, the district court here found 
that the workers' statistical and anecdotal evidence was insufficient to show a general 
policy in all Nucor departments that caused the class injury. 
The district court, however, failed to adequately appreciate three significant differences 
from Wal-Mart that make the case largely inapposite to the facts at hand. 
1. 
First, Wal-Mart discounted the plaintiffs' statistical r341 evidence in large part because 
the statistics failed to show discrimination on a store-by-store basis. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. 
Ct. at 2555. As such, the plaintiffs could not establish that a store greeter in Northern 
California, for instance, was subject to the same discrimination as a cashier in New 
Hampshire. These dissimilarities between class members were exacerbated by the sheer 
size of the Wal-Mart class - 1.5 million members working at 3,400 stores under "a 
kaleidoscope of supervisors (male and female), subject to a variety of regional policies 
[* 91 0] that all differed." Id. at 2557 (quoting Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 603 F.3d 571, 
652 (9th Cir. 2010) (Kozinski, J., dissenting)). The scale and scope of the putative class, 
combined with the nature of the evidence offered, was thus essential to Wal-Mart's 
holding. Had the class been limited to a single Wal-Mart store spanning multiple
