programs at a slower pace. That been said, we believe that the impact from 
these tragic events will be modest in 2018. 
With this report, we are reaffirming our BUY rating on the 4.625% Senior 
Unsecured Notes 2026 ($101.3, 4.4% YTVV, 207bps STVV). We continue to 
believe that these bonds are attractive on a relative value basis.

For 2017. we are projecting MGM Resorts International will generate Adjusted 
EBITDA of $2.32 billion (+11.5% versus $2.08 billion). Factoring wholly-owned 
capital expenditures of $990 million, MGM's share of MGM China's capital 
expenditures of $554 million, cash interest of S629 million, cash taxes of $170 
million, dividends from CityCenter and Grand Victoria of S314 million, 
dividends from MGM China of $69 million, share repurchases of $328 million, 
$250 million of dividends to shareholders, $5 million of investments in affiliates, 
and $294 million of distributions from MGM Growth Properties, we project 
total cash burn of 5697 million in 2017. Using our projected total debt of 
$11.25 billion and cash interest of $629 million, we estimate MGM will end the 
year with leverage of 4.9x and coverage of 3.7x. Factoring consolidated cash of 
$2.00 billion, we estimate net leverage at 4.0x. 
For 2018, we are projecting MGM Resorts International will generate Adjusted 
EBITDA of $2.48 billion (+7.0% versus $2.32 billion). Of importance, our 
projection includes the incremental contribution from MGM Cotai and 
Springfield. Factoring wholly-owned capital expenditures of $800 million, 
MGM's share of MGM China's capital expenditures of $168 million, cash 
interest of $603 million, cash taxes of $175 million, dividends from CityCenter 
and Grand Victoria of $90 million, dividends from MGM China of $125 million, 
$250 million of dividends to shareholders, 8100 million of share repurchases, 
and $354 million of distributions from MGM Growth Properties, we project
