SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Secondary Opportunities Fund Ill. LP 
entirely on the General Partner, and by virtue of the relevant agreements, the Manager, and their respective personnel to 
supervise, conduct and manage the affairs of the Fund. The loss of services of the Manager may adversely affect the 
performance of the Fund. The Manager has the right to (i) resign as the manager of the Fund or (ii) transfer its rights and 
obligations under the investment management agreement relating to the appointment of the Manager as the investment 
manager of the Fund (the 'Investment Management Agreement') to an affiliate at any point in the future without the 
consent of the Fund or the Limited Partners, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Investment Management 
Agreement. In addition, the General Partner has the right to remove the Manager as the manager of the Fund in certain 
circumstances. 
The success of the Fund depends in substantial part on the skill and expertise of the Principals and other employees of 
the Manager. While the Manager and its affiliates have substantial experience of transactions and investments of the 
type that the Fund intends to invest in. there can be no assurance that personnel who have played active and important 
roles in the success of prior endeavours of the DB Secondaries Funds will continue to be associated with the Fund, the 
Manager or their respective affiliates throughout the life of the Fund. The loss of skill and expertise of key personnel 
could have a material adverse effect on the Fund. In addition. Investors should be aware that the Manager and certain 
key personnel of the Manager (including certain Key Persons) have supervisory, management and other responsibilities 
within DB PE that are unrelated to the Secondary Private Equity platform of Deutsche Bank. 
The Fund is reliant on the performance of its depositary for its successful operation and may be materially affected by a 
failure in the depositary's performance. 
Lack of operating history 
Although members of the Manager's investment team have had extensive experience investing in the private equity 
sector, the Fund. the General Partner and the Second GP are newly formed entities with no operating history upon which 
to evaluate the Fund's likely performance. Investors must rely upon the Manager to identify, structure and implement 
investments consistent with the Fund's investment objectives and policies. 
Liquidity risk 
The Fund's investments are typically expected to be highly illiquid investments that are not listed on a stock exchange or 
for which there may only be a limited number of potential buyers. Political and regulatory considerations (including 
limitations on ownership and approval rights) could also affect the ability of the Fund to buy or sell investments on 
favourable terms. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to realise cash from such 
investments in a timely manner. and dispositions of such investments may require a lengthy time period or may result in 
distributions in kind to Investors. Moreover, the realisable value of a highly illiquid investment may be less than its 
intrinsic value or the valuation assigned to it by the Fund. 
Distributions in kind 
Although, under normal circumstances, it is intended that the Fund will make distributions in cash, it is possible that upon 
the liquidation of the Fund and in certain other circumstances as set out in the Fund Documents distributions may be 
made in kind (or in specie) and could consist of securities for which there is not a readily available public market, 
securities that are subject to legal and contractual transfer restrictions or securities of entities unable to make 
distributions. 
Investor risk 
Investors will be obliged to meet drawdown notices promptly, and failure to do so may subject an Investor to severe 
consequences as set out in the Fund Documents, including without limitation forfeiture of its Interest. Should an Investor 
fail to provide the money drawn down from it promptly, the Fund may be unable to consummate the investment for which 
the money was to be provided or may be unable to meet other obligations when due. As a result, the Fund may be 
subjected to significant penalties (which could materially and adversely affect the retums to Investors) and money
