1. 
TTM EBITDA is $6.7Million. If you =isagree, please let us know precisely 
what items you disagree with in =he number and we can discuss. 
2. 
The current cash balance for the company =s $13.1 Million. 
3. 
The past three comparable transactions for =ompanies in this market 
average an enterprise value at - 10x multiple of =BITDA 
a. 
Wilhelmina: 7x (average meaningful trading =ultiple since 2010) 
b. 
Creative Artists Agency: 10x (TPG =cquisition, 2014) 
c. 
IMG: 13x (WME acquisition, 2013) 
4. 
We invested $18 million for a 42% stake in =he business, implying an 
enterprise value of $42.9 million. 
5. 
We received a bona fide offer from =penGate Capital which would have 
resulted in $18 million in proceeds =or us (and in fact a $17 million distribution to Faith and Joel), and =hile they were, as 
you point out, contemplating leverage in the =It;3x EBITDA range, it is in fact a relevant data point and an =ndependent 
look at value. 
6. 
One other note that is relevant to us, is =hat when Elite Models in Europe 
contacted us with an interest in buying =he company, Faith told me to relay to them that they would not =ontemplate 
selling to Elite for less than $100 million (which at the =ime was a +10x synergy-adjusted EBITDA value). Ultimately they 
=alked based on that value requirement. 
I would hope you agree =hat the following is a commonly agreed upon formula 
for value: 
a. 
Enterprise value = EBITDA x Market =ultiple 
b. 
Equity Value = Enterprise Value + net =ash (or — net debt). 
One matter of judgment =s what of the cash balance is "excess cash". Joel =as 
said he believes all the cash is due to the models. The facts =how that in the ordinary course of business the collection 
of receivables offsets the payables and in the past three years, the cash =alance has only fluctuated at most by $3 
million, meaning anywhere from =8-10 million on the balance sheet should be considered to be "exc=ss cash", not 
needed for day-to-day operations. I have =ttached both a three year cash balance tracker and a current balance =heet 
for your review. 
Using the above, a very =odest calculation of value would be $6.7 million of 
EBITDA x 5 multiple =a 50% discount to the market) or an enterprise value of $33.5 million =nd if we took a conservative 
view of what excess cash is at the moment =f $8 million, would result in a total equity value of $41.5 =illion. Our 42% 
would equate to $17.4 million of proceeds to =s. That is at a multiple that has been deeply discounted to the =arket 
comps that were actually paid for companies in the same =usiness. 
We are, however, =illing to take much less than this very discounted value 
calculation, =s I have mentioned to you before. However, your proposal of $5 =illion of proceeds to us represents an 
equity value of $11.9 million =$5/.42), an enterprise value of $3.9 million ($11.9 million - $8 =illion of excess cash) or an 
EBITDA multiple of 0.58x ($6.7 x 0.58 = =3.9 enterprise value), a level that is far too low for us to =ccept. 
I look forward to our =iscussion tomorrow morning.
