As the Middle East's power blocs fracture, so do hopes of stability

14 October 2013 -- In the Middle East, long-established alliances are shift=ng dramatically. As one political leader in the 
region said to me recently= "The ground is shaking under our feet and we must keep all our options op=n." Three major 
events over the past three months have destabilised the ol= order: a military coup against Mohamed Morsi's 
government<http://www.theg=ardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/mohamed-morsi-egypt-second-revolution> in Egy=t; the 
Russian-American agreement to destroy Syria's chemical 
weapons<http=//www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/syria-deadline-destroy-chemical-we=pons-november>; 
and a phone call between Obama and the new Iranian preside=t Hassan 
Rouhani<http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/obama-phone-=all-iranian-president-rouhani>. 
But first: what did the old order look like? Before Hosni Mubarak's regime =as overthrown in Egypt, the Middle East was 
split into two main axes. The =o-called axis of moderation — Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, UAE and Kuwai= — was aligned 
with the west, supported the Palestinian National Authori=y and encouraged a political settlement with Israel. 
The axis of resistance — Iran, Syria and the political movements of Hamas=and Hezbollah — had a strained relationship 
with the west and considered=a political settlement with Israel as a surrender. Qatar and Turkey stood =lose to this axis, 
maintaining good relations with the axis of moderation. 
The fall of Mubarak's regime in January 2011 removed Egypt from the axis of=moderation and triggered the current 
regional turmoil. The Syrian uprising=against the Bashar al-Assad regime drove the Hamas leadership out of 
Syria=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17192278>, and out of the axis=of resistance. Turkey and Qatar 
also moved further away after both express=ng public support for the Syrian rebels. 
In this way, the axis of resistance was transformed into an axis of Iranian=Shia power, extending from Tehran to Nouri 
al-Maliki's government in Iraq =nd Hezbollah in Lebanon — a resilient axis united by support for the Ass=d regime. 
After Morsi's election, Turkey and Qatar lent Egypt financial and political=support, forming a new strategic alliance. Thus 
the coup that overthrew Mo=si in July was a strategic earthquake. But it was welcomed by what was lef= of the axis of 
moderation: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Jordan. The Sau=i king congratulated the interim president of Egypt and, 
with Kuwait and t=e UAE, offered him a package of aid exceeding $12bn, and King Abdullah II =f Jordan was the first 
Arab leader to visit Cairo after the coup. However,=Qatar and Turkey condemned the coup. Iran, though not sorry to see 
Morsi g= given his support for the Syrian revolution, was concerned to see Egypt s=rongly aligned once more with Iran's 
enemies. 
The aftershocks of the coup continue to affect the region. The countries su=porting it had hoped the military would 
enforce its rule in a matter of we=ks, but they miscalculated: three months on the Egyptian scene hasn't sett=ed down. 
There are still constant marches and protests, as well as an impo=ed evening curfew. Military and security measures 
have been taken against =he Sinai and several cities and villages opposing the coup, and are drivin= the country into a 
state of economic paralysis. 
On a regional level, there were other miscalculations, too. The new axis of=moderation tried to topple the Islamist 
movements in Tunisia and Libya, wh=le the Egyptian army began destroying the tunnels linking Gaza and Sinai a= well as 
launching an extensive campaign against Hamas with the hope of en=ing its control of the Gaza Strip. At the same time, 
the new axis of moder=tion also strained its relationship with Turkey, one of the most strategic=lly important countries 
in the region. 
However, the greatest miscalculation the new axis made was its evaluation o= the Russian and American position on 
Syria. This axis hoped Basher al-Ass=d's regime would be quickly eliminated and replaced with a regime aligned =ith the
