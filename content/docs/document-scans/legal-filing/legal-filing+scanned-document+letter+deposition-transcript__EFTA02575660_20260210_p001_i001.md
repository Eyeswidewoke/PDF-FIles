without a doubt , one of the smartest people i have ever met, /u am =ell aware of his he is neither fluent in spanish 
french or =talian however he is highly conversant =nd 
multilingual in the areas of the most =nbsp;advanced science. He can exquisitely conduct a =eminar in fields as diverse 
as evolutionary biology, computational =euro science.oreven the highly esoteric ndimensional =anifolds. ,as well as 
music as a lens into the brain. His =nterests are far ranging and unlike many that simply repeat back =hat they have read 
, he is creative and original in fields such ase , =ignal intelligence, power law distributions , and =ncryption. 
I am well aware that in his past he has =ade some awful decisions, and Im sure he would have done things =ifferently if 
he had the opportunity to do them over. however he =as paid his debt to society, asked his friends and family for 
=orgiveness and has continued his charitable work that he began even =ecades before his travails. 
i have had =he privilege to meet the worlds greatest minds, and i can easily =ay that Jeffrey s is amongst the best of 
=hose. 
I have utmost confidence in his =ntegrity. I have dealt with him for a number of years on both =ides of a negotiation and 
say with certainty that I;d rather be =n his side. 
He has been in the =illionaire business for longer than almost anyone else. His =nsight into the unique problems of the 
super wealthy, has been =nvaluable to many others that i know. He found a niche in the early 80s =iscerning the 
burdens of hyper wealth and from his time on the board of =ockefeller or his time at the trilateral commission, the 
common =efrain from those he has come in contact with Jeffrey has made me think =ifferently about. ....//. =/span> 
He has an extraordinary =bility with numbers, complex concepts. mixed with a =nbsp;sometimes brutal honesty, 
refreshing, a sense of humor =hat some find highly cultured others find just outright =illy, 
His homes are probably the best =ollection of real estate in the united states. A private island , =hat some describe as a 
tribute to megalomania. and a ranch in new =exico that is truly beyond imagination and my favorite townhouse in NY. 
=nbsp; His attention to detail is remarkable . I find =t sad that he doesn't have children of his own, but makes up for it 
by =aintaining close friendships that have lasted for =ecades. 
His chariblae instincts have =een honed over many years and his advice and judgment has been =nvaluable in several 
instances. 
His =bility to explain complex derivatives or concepts on the bleeding edge =f science in layman's terms is part of his 
teaching =ene. 
I have met many people who =riticize those who maintain a friendship with Jeffrey, and a group =hose opinions are 
impervious to change , however, in the vast =ajority of cases , it is with those that have not had the opportunity =o sit 
with him watch as his mind performs an intellectuall ballet. =nbsp;gracefully moving from one difficult topic and 
transitioning to =nother seemingly unrelated , only at the end to have the thread pulled =ightly and ending with an 
elegant coda. =inale. 
I can call him and ask , can you =xplain this to me, and with an impish respond, and a breath of fresh =ir, if he can't , he 
simply says I Don't know. =
