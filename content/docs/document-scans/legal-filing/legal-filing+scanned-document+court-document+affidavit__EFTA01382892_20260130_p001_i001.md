Form ADV Part 2A 
potential lack of diversification, higher fees than those offered through more traditional 
investment products (such as mutual funds), and lack of information regarding valuations and 
pricing. Each prospective investor will be required to complete a subscription agreement for 
any Fund in which it seeks to invest, pursuant to which the prospective investor shall establish 
that he/she is qualified for investment in the Fund, and acknowledges and accepts the various 
risk factors that are associated with such an investment 
The risks and conflicts of interest described in the Underlying Fund PPM with respect to the 
Underlying Fund and an investment therein apply generally to a Private Access Fund. 
Moreover, without limiting the application or generality of the foregoing. each Private Access 
Fund will be either (A) a newly formed entity or (B) an entity with a limited operating history 
(i) that will not be registered under the Investment Company Act. (ii) that will issue illiquid 
securities that are not registered under the Securities Act or any other laws. (iii) that will not 
register under the Exchange Act. (iv) the Interests of which will be subject to restrictions on 
transfer. (v) which will not be permitted to make full or partial withdrawals from an Underlying 
Fund pursuant to the terms of the Underlying Funds' governing agreement (except in very 
limited circumstances) and 
(vi) with respect to which, investors may lose the entire amount of their investment The 
returns of the Private Access Fund will depend almost entirely on the performance of its 
investment in the Underlying Fund and there can be no assurance that the Underlying Fund will 
be able to implement its investment objective and strategy. Certain ongoing operating 
expenses of the Private Access Fund, which will be in addition to those expenses borne by the 
Private Access Fund as an investor in the Underlying Fund (e.g.. carried interest, management 
fees, underlying fund expenses. organizational expenses and other expenses and liabilities 
borne by investors in the Underlying Fund), generally will be borne by the Private Access Fund 
and the Investors with a corresponding impact on the returns to the Investors. Such additional 
expenses of the Private Access Fund will reduce the Private Access Funds' performance 
relative to the Underlying Fund. 
Pending investment in the applicable Underlying Fund, the Private Access Fund may invest a 
portion of its assets in short term interest bearing accounts which would not meet the 
Underlying Funds' overall return objectives. An investor in the Private Access Fund will have 
only those rights provided for in the PPM. iCapital is not the General Partner or manager of 
the Underlying Fund. None of any Private Access Fund, iCapital or any of their affiliates will 
take part in the management of the Underlying Fund or have control over its management 
strategies and policies. Each Private Access Fund is subject to the risk of bad judgment. 
negligence, or misconduct of the general partner or manager of the Underlying Fund and its 
affiliates. There have been a number of instances in recent years in which pooled investment 
vehicles investing in third-party funds have incurred substantial losses due to sponsor 
misconduct. The PPM will provide for indemnification of iCapital and its affiliates and certain 
other indemnified parties and any such indemnification (and the expense thereof) will be in 
addition to any indemnification granted under the Underlying Fund constituent documents. 
Investors in a Private Access Fund may receive in-kind distributions to the extent the 
Underlying Fund distributes securities in-kind to its investors and the securities or other assets 
so received in an in-kind distribution may not be marketable or otherwise freely tradable. 
With respect to any such securities or other assets distributed in-kind. the risk of loss and 
delay in liquidating these securities or assets will be borne by the Investors of the Private 
Access Fund, with the result that such Investors may receive less cash than reflected in the fair 
value of such securities as determined by iCapital pursuant to the offering documents.
