SQUARE, INC. 
Our First Sellers 
The story of Square is best told through the stories of our sellers, the customers we serve. 
As soon as we had a working prototype of our first credit card reader, we went out to talk to sellers. We met owners of a 
wide range of businesses, and they shared with us many of the challenges they faced. 
We met Cheri, the owner of a flower cart called Lilybelle, who lost a sale when a customer did not have any cash and 
Cheri had no way to accept credit cards.
