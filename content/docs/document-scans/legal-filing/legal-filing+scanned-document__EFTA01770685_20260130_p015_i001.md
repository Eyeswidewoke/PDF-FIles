circumstances." And this wasn't about building a=bomb; most Iranians said Iran's nuclear activities shouldn't include 
producing weapons. 
Even Dennis Ross--w=o has rarely, in his long career as a Mideast diplomat, left much daylight=between his positions 
and AIPAC's, and who once categorically opposed <http://www.lobelog.com/top-obama-adviser-signs-on-to-roadmap-
to-=ar-with-iran/> Iranian enrichment--now realizes that a diplomatic solution may=have to include enrichment. Last 
week in a New York Times op-ed, he said chttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/opinion/give-diplomacy-with-ir=n-a-
chance.html> that, contrary to pessimistic assessments, it may still be possibl= to get a deal that "uses intrusive 
inspections and denies or limits =ranium enrichment [emphasis added)..." 
The resolution play= down its departure from current policy by claiming that there have been &=uot;multiple" UN 
resolutions since 2006 demanding the "sustained=quot; suspension of uranium. But the UN resolutions don't actually 
use that term. The UN has demanded suspension as a confidence-bui=ding measure that could then lead to, as one 
resolution puts it, a "n=gotiated solution that guarantees Iran's nuclear program is for exclusivel= peaceful purposes." 
And various Security Council members who voted on these resolutions have made it clear that Ira=ian enrichment of 
uranium can be part of this scenario if Iran agrees to s=fficiently tight monitoring. 
Indeed, that Iran's=right to enrich uranium could be recognized under those circumstances is, =illary Clinton has said 
<http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg64869/pdf/CHRG-112hhrg6=869.pdf> , "the position of the international 
community, along with the=United States." If the Lieberman-Graham-Casey resolution guides US po=icy, says George 
Perkovich of the Carnegie Endowment for International Pea=e, that would "preclude" fulfillment of the UN resolutions 
and isolate the US from the international coalition that ba=ked them. 
The Congressional r=solution goes beyond the UN resolutions in another sense. It demands an en= to Iran's ballistic 
missile program. Greg Thielmann of the Arms Control A=sociation notes that, "Even after crushing Iraq in the first Gulf 
War, the international coalition only imposed a 150=kilometer range ceiling on Saddam's ballistic missiles. A demand to 
elimin=te all ballistic missiles would be unprecedented in the modern era--removi=g any doubt among Iranians that the 
United States was interested in nothing less than the total subjugatio= of the country." 
On the brighter sid=: Maybe it's a good sign that getting significant Democratic buy-in for th=s resolution took some 
strong-arming. According to <http://peacenow.org/entries/legislative_round-up_february_13-17_=012> Lara Friedman 
of Americans for Peace Now, the resolution g=t 15 Democratic supporters only "after days of intense AIPAC lobbying= 
particularly of what some consider 'vulnerable' Democrats (vulnerable in =erms of being in races where their pro-Israel 
credentials are being challenged by the candidate running against them).&q=ot; What's more, even as AIPAC was 
playing this hardball, the bill's spons=rs still had to tone down some particularly threatening language in the re=olution. 
But, even so, the r=solution defines keeping Iran from getting a nuclear weapons "capabil=ty" as being in America's 
"vital national interest," which =s generally taken as synonymous with "worth war." And, though this "sense of 
Congress" resolution is nonbinding, AIPAC =ill probably seek unanimous Senate consent, which puts pressure on a 
presi=ent. Friedman says this "risks sending a message that Congress suppor=s war and opposes a realistic negotiated 
solution or any de facto solution short of stripping Iran of even a peaceful nuclea= capacity." 
What's more, says F=iedman, the non-binding status may be temporary. "Often AIPAC-backed =ongressional initiatives 
start as non-binding language (in a resolution or=a letter) and then show up in binding legislation. Once members of 
Congress have already signed on to a policy in non-binding=form, it is much harder for them to oppose it when it shows 
up later in a =ill that, if passed, will have the full force of law." 
No wonder Democrats=who worry about war have the "jitters."
