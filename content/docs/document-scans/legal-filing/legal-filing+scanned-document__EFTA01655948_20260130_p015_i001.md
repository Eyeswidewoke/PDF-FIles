General Events 
• CSIS: South Korean Presidential Election  I The Capital Cable #113 — Thursday, May 22, 2025. Location: Online 
event, 9:30 AM. The official campaign season for the 2025 South Korean presidential election started on May 
12. What to expect from the three major candidates, Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party of Korea, Kim 
Moon-soo of the People Power Party and Lee Jun-seok of the Reform Party? What are some of the major 
issues confronting the candidates as they make their case for the people's vote on June 3? 
• AEI: Why Did America Get Pandemic Schooling So Wrong? — Thursday, May 22, 2025. Location: Online event, 
2:00 PM. Five years later, many agree that America's education system failed during the pandemic. 
Prolonged school closures and subpar remote learning led to devastating academic losses, rising chronic 
absenteeism, and a breakdown in parents' trust in the education system. But why did schools remain closed 
for so long? Why did so many embrace what some have called "COVID theater"—implementing masking 
mandates and other ineffective measures? 
• Aspen Institute: How Employers Are Tackling Mobility Blockers in Public Benefit Programs — Thursday, May 
22, 2025. Location: Online event, 1:00 PM. Employers provide both wages and benefits essential for worker 
financial well-being. For millions of workers also receiving public benefits, rules within those programs 
determine whether these employer-provided resources carry reward or risk. Policies, for example, like asset 
limits penalize saving, while benefit cliffs create a precipitous loss of benefits when wages increase, blocking 
workers' financial mobility.
