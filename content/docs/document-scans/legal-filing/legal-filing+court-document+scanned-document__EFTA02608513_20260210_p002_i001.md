violation of Florida state law. Although n= coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs or the like were involved, some of 
the=women he paid were under the age of 18. Those facts were c=refully assessed by experienced state sex crime 
prosecutors who aggressive=y enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potentia= offenses to the public 
order. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State=Attorney's Office conducted an extensive fifteen-month investigation, =ed 
by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then ind=cted by the state grand jury on a single felony count of 
solicitation of p=ostitution. 
During that intense investigation, the state p=osecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met 
face-to=face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility =80 or lack thereof — and considered the 
extent of exculpatory e=idence, including sworn testimony from many that they lied =bout being eighteen years old to 
be allowed into Mr. Epstein's hom=. After months of negotiations, the state prosecutors believed they =ad reached a 
reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public =nterest — a resolution entirely consistent with that of 
cases invo=ving other similarly-situated defendants. The system worked as it sh=uld have. 
=hen, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office exten=ively and aggressively investigated whether 
Mr. Epstein had engaged in a c=mmercial human trafficking ring, targeted minors, or used the interne= or traveled 
interstate in the process. But that's not =hat this was and that's not what happened. That is prec=sely why the federal 
authorities' ultimate decision to defer=C2 prosecution to the state was the right one. <=> 
However, the federally-demanded r=solution was not without conditions. The federal prosecutors insisted on 
v=rious unorthodox requirements that Mr. Epstein's experienced =efense team had never seen imposed on any 
defendant anywhere. Under the fe=erally-forced deal, Jeffrey was required to request that the state pr=secutors 
demand the imposition of a thirty-month sentence that included =A0both jail time and the strictest conditions of 
probation: life=ime sex-offender registration. Those draconian measures were far more=than warranted by the state 
grand jury's indictment and would=not have otherwise been required under the previously agreed-upon state 
di=position. As part of this highly unusual deal, the government re=uired Jeffrey to pay for a highly experienced group of 
attorneys=to bring claims against him on behalf of a government list of asserted vic=ims. Jeffrey was required to waive 
the right to challenge those claims wit=out being provided the asserted victim's identities by the governm=nt until after 
he was incarcerated. Importantly, the feds' decis=on to decline prosecution in deference to the state in exchange for 
t=ese extraordinary requirements was reviewed and approved at the =ultiple levels of the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Jeffrey took full=C2 responsibility, complied with the feds' demands, served =is sentence, and in the process was treated 
exactly the same (includi=g his time served) as any other state-incarcerated individuals. =His conduct while in custody 
was exemplary, and so characterized by the st=te custodial authorities. 
<=u> 
Jeffrey Epstein has paid his deb= to society. The challenges to his Agreement with the Government =A0must also 
be understood as challenges to the millions Mr. Epstein paid t= the asserted victims and their lawyers pursuant to that 
agreement. A=ongst the beneficiaries of the Epstein-Federal Government Agreement were t=e many victims who 
collectively received many millions as a result of the =onditions imposed on Mr. Epstein that prevented him from 
meaningfully cont=sting civil liability — moneys that would be at issue if requests =o invalidate the agreement were 
granted.
