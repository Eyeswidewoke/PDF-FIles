Pershing's Impartial Lottery Process: Partial Calls 
Information about PershMg's impartial lottery process can be found on pershing.conVbusiness_continuity. You may also request a printed copy of this information by calhng (888) 367-2563, option 3 then option 5. 
When a security is subject to a partial redemption, pursuant to FINRA Rule 4340, Pershing must have procedures in place that are designed to treat clients fairly in accordance with an impartial lottery process. 
When an issuer initiates a partial caN of securities, the depository holding such securities (typically, the Depository Trust Clearing and Corporation. or DTCC) conducts an impartial, computerized lottery using an 
incremental random number technique to determine the allocation of called securities to participants for which it holds securities on deposit (including Pershing). Because DTC's lottery is random and impartial, 
participants may or may not receive an allocation of securities selected for redemption. 
When Pershing is notified that it received an allocation of called securities. Pershing conducts a similar, computer-generated random lottery. The lottery determines the accounts that will be selected and the 
number of securities in the account that will be redeemed. Allocations are based on the number of trading units held in the account The probability of any trading unit held by an account being selected as called 
in a partial call is proportional to the total number of trading units held through Pershing.
