selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires separately designated 
payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a 
condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments 
toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain 
Mortgage Insurance in effect, if permitted under Applicable Law, or to provide a non-refundable 
loss reserve, until Lender's requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with any written 
agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such termination or until termination is 
required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 10 affects Borrower's obligation to pay interest 
at the rate provided in the Note. 
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it 
may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage 
Insurance. 
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may 
enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These 
agreements are on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other 
party (or parties) to these agreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make 
payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may 
include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums). 
As a result of these agreements. Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any reinsurer. 
any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts 
that derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower's payments for Mortgage 
Insurance, in exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer's risk, or reducing losses. If 
such agreement provides that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the insurer's risk in exchange for 
a share of the premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often termed "captive reinsurance." 
Further: 
(a) 
Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for 
Mortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase 
the amount Borrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle 
Borrower to any refund. 
(b) 
Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with respect to the 
Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law. 
These rights may include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain 
cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated 
automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any Mortgage Insurance premiums that were 
unearned at the time of such cancellation or termination. 
11. Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby 
assigned to and shall be paid to Lender. 
If the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of 
the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is not 
lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such 
Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the 
work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken
