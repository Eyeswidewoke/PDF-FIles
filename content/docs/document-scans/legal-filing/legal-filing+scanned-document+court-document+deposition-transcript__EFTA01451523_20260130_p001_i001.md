SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
make a "qualified electing fund" ("QEF") election; however, there can be no assurance 
that the information necessary to make such election will be provided by the relevant 
entity. U.S. Holders may be required to file an annual report with respect to any entity in 
which the Master Fund invests that is treated as a PFIC. In addition, Investors that are U.S. 
corporations will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to 
dividends received from non-U.S. corporations. 
Certain Transactions and Foreign Currency Gain or Loss. The Master Fund may 
engage in hedging, foreign currency and derivative transactions that may have special 
timing, character and source rules for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Further, if the 
Master Fund makes an investment or obtains financing denominated in a currency other 
than the U.S. dollar, then it may recognize gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in such 
currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The Master Fund may also recognize gain or loss on 
such fluctuations occurring between the time it obtains and disposes of the non-U.S. 
currency, between the time it accrues and collects income denominated in a non-U.S. 
currency or between the time it accrues and pays liabilities denominated in a non-U.S. 
currency. Such gains or losses generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. 
Tax-Exempt Investors. The Master Fund may (i) invest in operating entities that are 
transparent for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) generate unrelated debt-financed 
income if it borrows funds, or (iii) generate some income, for example, from break-up fees 
or transaction fees, each of which activities may cause Investors that are pension plans, 
Keogh plans, individual retirement accounts, tax-exempt institutions and other tax-exempt 
Limited Partners ("U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors") to have UBTI. 
Interests in the Onshore Feeder Fund are being offered only to U.S. taxable Investors and 
U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors that are willing to receive material amounts UBTI. If an 
investor is a Non-U.S. Holder for U.S. tax purposes, that investor should not invest in the 
Onshore Feeder Fund since adverse tax consequences could result for the Investor. U.S. 
Tax-Exempt Investors that are not willing to receive material amounts UBTI and 
Non-U.S. Holders should, if eligible, consider an investment in the Offshore Feeder Fund. 
One or more offshore vehicles may be organized to accommodate certain qualified 
non-U.S. Investors and U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors who do not wish to receive UBTI. 
Tax Elections. The Code provides for optional adjustments to the basis of Onshore Feeder 
Fund property upon distributions of Onshore Feeder Fund property to an Investor and 
transfers of Interests, including transfers by reason of death, provided that an election has 
been made pursuant to section 754 of the Code. As a result of the complexities and added 
expense of the tax accounting required to implement such an election, and because such 
election, once made, is irrevocable, the General Partner currently does not intend to make 
such an election. Accordingly, any benefits that might be available to the Investors by 
reason of such an election will not be available to an Investor. 
Although the Onshore Feeder Fund has no present intention of making an election under 
section 754 of the Code, section 754 adjustments may nevertheless be mandatory under 
certain circumstances and could affect the amount of a U.S. Holder's distributive share of 
gain or loss recognized by the Onshore Feeder Fund on a disposition of its assets.
