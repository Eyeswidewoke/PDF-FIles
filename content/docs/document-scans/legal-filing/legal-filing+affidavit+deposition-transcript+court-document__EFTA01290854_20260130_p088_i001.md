Important Information and Disclosures 
Pricing 
This section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including shrill positions, at the close of the statement period. The market prices, unless otherwise noted, 
have been obtained from independent vendor services, which we believe to be reliable. Market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ from the actual sale price. Securities for which a price is 
not available are marked 'N/A" and are omitted from the Total. 
THE AS OF PRICE DATE ONLY APPEARS WHEN THE PRICE DATE DOES NOT EQUAL THE STATEMENT DATE. 
The pricing of securities on this statement may vary from their actual liquidation value. Prices shown should only be used as a general guide to portfolo value. Cash shown in this statement may not necessarily 
be available for investment due to unsettled transactions against your account(s). Prices for marketable securities are received from various pricing services thought to be reliable; however, pricing services are 
sometimes unable to provide timely information. Where pricing sources are not readily available, estimated prices may be used. When the updated price is received from the price provider, the updated price will 
be used in the release of the current month's statement. Prior statements wit not be revised. You should always request a current valuation for your securities prior to making a financial decision or placing an 
order. 
Deutsche Bank proprietary investments and miscellaneous assets held by Discretionary Accounts, Trust Accounts and Custody Accounts include several categories of securities. Miscellaneous foreign assets 
are priced via third party sources believed to be reliable. 
For certain securities, including thinly-traded securities, debt securities in default, securities that do not have a valid pricing source, and certain third-party structured products, the last available pricing will be 
listed. If the last price available for such securities is unchanged for a period of tine deemed appropriate for that asset, the current price will purge and N/A will be placed in the price field in the statement. The 
pricing of listed options takes into account the last closing price, as well as the current bid and offer prices. 
Estimated Annual Figures 
The estimated annual income (EAI) and estimated annual yield (EAY) figures are esbmates and for informational purposes only. These figures are not considered to be a forecast or guarantee of future results. 
These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable; however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, 
and may be affected by current and future economic, political and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position 
quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant A capital gain or return of principal may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to 
vnwipershing.cornibusiness_conbnuity.htni for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. Accrued interest represents interest eamed but not yet received. 
Reinvestment 
The dollar amount of Mutual Fund distributions, Money Market Fund dividend income, Bank Deposit interest income, or dividends for other securities shown on your statement may have been reinvested. You will 
not receive confirmation of these reinvestments. Upon written request to your financial institution, information pertaining to these transactions, Mckffling the time of execution and the name of the person from
