UBS CIO Monthly Letter 
that is likely to slow global growth and will be one of the 
key trends of our lifetimes. A return to sustainable global 
economic growth will require policymakers around the 
world to confront these challenges head-on, in creative 
and effective ways. 
In the meantime, aggressive action by central banks has 
greatly reduced tail risks and global growth is showing 
signs of improvement, thereby supporting our "middle 
ground" strategy of focusing on corporate credit, and in 
particular, US high yield. 
The US high yield sector has gained 14% year-to-date, 
but the key question for investors is whether this rally will 
last. We expect prices to rise further as yield spreads 
tighten from their current level of around 5.4% towards 
our target of 4.75%. While US corporate balance sheets 
have been repaired through deleveraging and cautious 
business activity, the yield spread is still far from its pre-
crisis low of 2.4%. 
Low refinancing needs, ongoing US growth, and a 
healthy US banking sector are also supportive of US high 
yield bonds. In addition, we expect default rates to 
remain below the historical average (see Figure 3). 
Our research shows that over the longer term, the total 
returns of high yield corporate bonds are mainly driven by 
two factors: the "fixed" coupon component and the 
default rate (see Figure 4). Since 1990, 115% of the total 
return can be attributed to coupons, -30% to default 
losses and the remaining 15% to the decline in the Treas-
ury yield. Consequently, as long as high yield bonds pro-
vide a decent coupon, aggressive spread tightening is not 
needed from current levels to still earn a reasonable return. 
Why are we not overweight equities in the current envi-
ronment? Global equities have rallied substantially since 
June, but for this rally to be sustained, we would need to 
see clarity around the US fiscal cliff, a re-acceleration of

corporate earnings, and further strength in business 
fundamentals. 
Within equities, our preference remains with the US and 
emerging markets (EM). Inflows into EM economies have 
started to pick up over the past month, supported by signs 
of economic recovery in key regions, most notably China 
and Brazil. In addition, stronger commodity prices are 
likely to support EM earnings, given the high tilt towards 
the energy and materials sectors in many developing 
nations. And lastly, the traditional scare factor for EM 
equities, namely inflation, appears under control, which 
leaves room for further central bank support. In our view, 
these factors all justify an overweight in EM equities. 
For investors seeking EM exposure with a somewhat 
lower level of volatility, we continue to highlight the 
attractive yields offered by EM corporate bonds. 
In major currencies, we are maintaining our recommen-
dation to underweight the Japanese yen. The Japanese 
economy continues to weaken against its peers, raising 
pressure on the Bank of Japan to engage in further quan-
titative easing. We have also closed our preference for 
the Canadian dollar, which is less attractively valued after 
solid gains against the US dollar in recent months. And 
finally, we have closed our remaining short position in 
the Swiss franc.
