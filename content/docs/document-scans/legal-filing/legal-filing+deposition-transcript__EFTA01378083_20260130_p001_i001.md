Note 2—Summary of significant accounting policies 
Accounting for investments 
Investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence 
over the operating and financial matters of the investee are accounted for using the cost method. Investments in companies that the Company does not 
control, which are not in the form of common stock or in-substance common stock, are also accounted for using the cost method. The Company evaluates 
each cost method investment for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if a decline in value is determined to be other-than-
temporary. Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the current business environment, including competition: going concern considerations 
such as financial condition and the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; 
the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and Its ability to successfully implement 
necessary changes: and comparable valuations. If the Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse 
effect on the fair value of a cost method investment, then the fair value of such cost method investment is not estimated, as it is impracticable to do so. 
Accounting estimates 
Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its combined financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP. These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities. revenue and expenses and the 
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to: the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived 
intangible assets: the useful lives and recovery of definite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment: the fair value of long-term investments: the 
carrying value of accounts receivable, including the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves; the fair value of acquisition-
related contingent consideration; the fiabilities for uncertain tax positions; the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets: and the fair value of and 
forfeiture rates for stock-based awards, among others. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, its forecasts and budgets 
and other factors that the Company considers relevant.
