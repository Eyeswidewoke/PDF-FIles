10 When your body mind dies as a particular process the universe ex=erienced by that particular body/ mind dies as well 
but impersonal awarene=s being formless remains.That which has no form is not in time . 
11 The essential " you " is not body/mind/ universe but the aw=reness in which body/ mind / universe arise and subside 
in every moment as=sensations, images, feelings, thoughts, and perceptions. 
12 The body /mind / universe you experienced as an infant teenager etc a=e long dead as experiences. They are born 
and die =A0in every moment. 
13 Your never the same body/ mind but you know yourself as th= same being ( being/ awareness/ consciousness are 
the same ontologically i= eastern wisdom traditions. 
14 Where is memory ? The cellular basis of memory remains elusive althou=h like every experience memory has has 
neural correlates. I learnt how to =ce skate as a 12 year old boy with a 12 year old body/ mind and the d=d not pick up 
ice skates again until I was 45 years old but had no problem remembering how to ice skate with a =ifferent 
body/mind/brain. 
15 The goal of all meditative techniques ( there are hundreds =f variations) is to stop identifying with the personal ego 
mind and =hysical body and to experience the common ground of shared exper=ence in awareness and so to awaken 
love compassion joy and equanimity ( divine emotions ). Anger / hostility/ fear/ guilt/ shame= shame/ resentment are 
products of the fragmented mind. 
16 Religion / Philosophy/ Theology / Science etc are systems of thought = Systems of thought create models of reality. 
Science is a very useful mod=l for creating technology albeit with side effects-climate change , ecolog=cal devastation 
and mechanized death {including nuclear weapons which if in the hands of more primit=ve systems of thought -religious 
fanatics- could result in our extinction)=/p> 
17 Reality perhaps can only be grasped when all ideologies are abandoned=& body mind ego are all experiences are 
transcende= and only formless being/ awareness remains. 
18 Awareness/consciousness cannot be seen , heard, touched, tasted or sm=lled but without it none of those 
experiences would be possible . 
19 Body/ mind / universe are human concepts in human awareness for an in=ermittent stream of sensations, images, 
feelings, thoughts, sense percepti=ns , that are known in consciousness/awareness and indeed modifications =AO of 
awareness itself. 
20 You started you lecture by saying you were a material moni=t but very quickly moved into dualistic metaphors. 
21 You spent a lot of time debunking the paranormal - a subject that was=not part of the conference where we were 
trying to figure out the normal .=/p> 
22 I wished you had been there for Amanda Gefter's talk w=en she she brought up nothingness as the only invariant --
not even spaceti=e! 
23 The task that now remains is --how does nothing give rise to everythi=g & what exactly is it ?! 
24 Finally it was great seeing you, =ennifer and baby 
Vincent who is an angel ! ( yes--that is =eant metaphorically please}
