Just a few hours before the launch of the deadly offensive against military=targets and Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip, 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjam=n Netanyahu was in his favorite place: in front of live television cameras= On Wednesday 
evening, he addressed the Israeli people with direct, aggres=ive words. "Today, we relayed a clear message to the 
Hamas organization an= other terrorist organizations," he said. "If there is a need, the militar= is prepared to expand the 
operation." Defense Minister Ehud Barak also ad=ressed reporters, saying that Hamas' "consistent provocation in recent 
wee=s ... forced our hand into acting with both precision and decisiveness." 
The dual appearance seems to betray the motives behind the most recent atta=ks. "When the cannons roar, we see only 
Netanyahu and Barak on the screen =and all the other politicians have to applaud them," wrote the daily Haare=z in a 
commentary published Thursday. "The assassination of (Hamas' top mi=itary commander Ahmed) Jabari will go down in 
history as another showy mil=tary action initiated by an outgoing government on the eve of an election.= Indeed, one 
can conclude that the most recent offensive against militants i= the Hamas-ruled Gaza 
Strip<http://www.spiegeLde/internationalflopic/gaza=striph -- which started Wednesday with the killing of Jabari --
has been =onceived as more of a show fight for the Israeli public than the beginning=of a decisive battle. 
Dangerous Gambling 
Both Netanyahu and Barak would have good reasons for wanting to use a succe=sful mini-campaign to score points 
before parliamentary elections are held=on Jan. 22. Netanyahu is undoubtedly afraid that ex-Prime Minister Ehud Ol=ert 
could snatch votes away from his Likud party if he decides to throw hi= hat in the ring. In fact, there are rumors that 
Olmert was planning to an=ounce his candidacy precisely on Wednesday evening. But the military actio= codenamed 
"Pillar of Defense" upset his plans. 
Defense Minister Barak can also no longer assume that his "Independence" pa=ty, which broke off from the Labor Party 
in January 2011, will win enough =otes to keep seats in the country's parliament, the Knesset. However, a su=cessful 
offensive could boost its waning popularity enough to guarantee it=some parliamentary seats. An offensive that gets the 
population to close r=nks behind the military would also divert attention away from pressing soc=al problems in 
Israel.<http://www.spiegelde/international/topic/israelk =oing so would take the wind out of the sails of groups such 
as the Labor P=rty and cost them votes, thereby helping Netanyahu's and Barak's respectiv= parties. 
Still, even if the offensive might give the two some political advantages, =t also entails massive risks. If the violence gets 
out of hand and the con=lict between Israel and Hamas escalates into something like the three-week=war that broke out 
between the two in December 2008, it could have drastic=consequences for the men who orchestrated it. 
The Israeli public is extremely sensitive to casualties. Sentiments could s=iftly turn in the event of a few more of 
incidents like the Thursday attac= that saw a rocket slam into an apartment building in the southern Israeli=town of 
Kiryat Malachi, killing two men and a woman. Likewise, should the =sraeli government respond to a constant barrage of 
rockets launched from t=e Gaza Strip by ordering ground troops to advance into the coastal area, i= could spell even 
more casualties and even more public opposition to the l=aders who launched "Pillar of Defense." 
A Dangerous Balancing Act on Both Sides 
Netanyahu's government hopes the offensive will usher in the status quo ant=. Israel would like to re-establish the 
cease-fire that it hammered out wi=h Hamas in January 2009, at the end of the war in Gaza. Though it was a fr=gile 
peace, for the most part, it was respected. But Hamas has been embold=ned by the recent election victory in Egypt of 
the Muslim Brotherhood, Ham=s' political parent organization. Just a few months ago, Hamas started to =eriously 
jeopardize the peace by beginning to launch rockets into Israeli =erritory and attacking Israeli border patrols. 
Internal political calculus was also behind the Palestinians' decision to i=crease the number of attacks during the late 
summer: Hamas' power base is =rumbling. Many Gaza Strip residents believe the organization is too weak a=d view the 
cease-fire with Israel as a betrayal. In recent years, the supp=rt of these disenchanted residents has migrated to 
considerably more radic=l groups. By making itself appear more bellicose, Hamas hopes to win back =hese former 
supporters. 
Indeed, more than anything, it is the presence of these ultra-radical group= in the Gaza Strip that could turn Israel's 
current offensive into an adve=ture that spirals out of control. Goaded by Israeli airstrikes and shellin= from tanks and 
naval gunboats, these extremists will be even less incline= to agree to a new cease-fire. Their supporters expect them to 
take a toug= stance and reject all compromises. 
These groups are affiliated with terror cells based in the Sinai Peninsula,=and some of them have ties to al-Qaida. In the 
past, they have already blo=ked the attempts of Egyptian intermediaries to broker a cease-fire. In the=days to come, 
Israel could face a situation in which Hamas becomes incapab=e of imposing one even if it wants to.
