Competition 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter 
intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check 
companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic 
acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting 
business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater 
financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be 
limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the 
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public 
stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business 
combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed 
favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in 
successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

Facilities 
We currently maintain our executive offices at I Rockefeller Center. New York, New York 10020. The cost 
for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month fee our sponsor will charge us for office space, utilities and 
administrative XrViCes. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
Employees 
We currently have two executive officers. While Mr. Zepf currently expects to devote the substantial majority 
of his time to our affairs, other members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number 
of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until 
we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that Mr. Zepf or any other members of 
our management will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for 
our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
We will register our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting 
obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In 
accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements 
audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.
