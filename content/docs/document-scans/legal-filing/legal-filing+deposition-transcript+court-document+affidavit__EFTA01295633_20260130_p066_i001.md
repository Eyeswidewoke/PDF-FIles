785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
even affirmed a district court's choice to exclude work from the same expert precisely 
because he did not incorporate adequate controls. See r118] Anderson, 406 F.3d at 
262-63 (agreeing with the district court's view that the expert had ignored "actual job 
performance or job requirements" even though he "conceded" that he could have "use[d] a 
control factor that would control for the actual job title or the job duties"). 
Plaintiffs' experts assumed that all persons in each bidding pool were equally qualified 
because "only persons who decided to bid based on the posted qualifications were 
included." J.A. 1162. This opaque language obscures another faulty assumption built into 
the model: the experts assumed that only qualified persons applied for each promotion 
opportunity. It takes no expertise to comprehend that some people "might be discouraged 
from applying because of a self-recognized inability to meet the [opening's] standards." 
Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 330, 97 S. Ct. 2720, 53 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1977). But one 
could hardly assume that every job applicant is so discerning, and even the majority 
seems unwilling to make that assumption. See maj. op. at 25. The majority prefers to 
guess that the number of unqualified applicants will be so trivially small as to be 
statistically irrelevant, and it makes that guess simply because the job announcement 
includes job requirements. In practical effect, the majority has read the "qualified [""119] 
applicants" limitation found in our prior cases out of the law, as most every job opening 
provides some minimal description of what skills are required. 
"A statistical study that fails to correct for explanatory variables, or even to make the most 
elementary comparisons, has no value as causal explanation[.]" People Who Care v. 
Rockford Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d 528, 537 (7th Cir. 1997). Plaintiffs presented just such a 
study here, and the district court did not clearly err in rejecting it. 
7. 
Lastly, Plaintiffs' statistical evidence improperly aggregates data in a way that distorts the 
results. 
a. 
The objective in a class action — even in a proceeding that alleges disparate treatment -- is 
[1'943] to identify a common, uniform policy. "While in a case alleging intentional 
discrimination, such as this one, a plaintiff need not isolate the particular practice and 
prove that such practice caused the discrimination, plaintiffs must make a significant 
showing to permit the court to infer that members of the class suffered from a common 
policy of discrimination that pervaded all of the employer's challenged employment 
decisions." Love v. Johanns, 439 F.3d 723, 728, 370 U.S. App. D.C. 96 (D.C. Cir. 2006). 
Thus, if the class challenges a policy implemented at the nationwide level, then plaintiffs 
might use applicable statistics showing nationwide disparities ["120] to establish the 
policy's effects. Conversely, if the class challenges policies implemented on a plant-by-
plant or department-by-department basis, then the class must summon statistics showing 
disparities at that level. Otherwise, non-uniform decisions made by one discriminatory 
decisionmaker might create disparities that, when aggregated with other, neutral decisions, 
misleadingly indicate discrimination across the whole group of decisionmakers.
