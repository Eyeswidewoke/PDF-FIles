7. =nbsp; Consider changing the Rule Against Perp=tuities in Section D of Article XVI to the maximum extent 
allowed under law= Although Massachusetts has not currently repealed its rule against p=rpetuities, it is possible that 
such legislation could be enacted in the future. It would be preferable to=allow the trusts to continue for the maximum 
extent permitted by law. 
I don't think any meaning could be determi=ed if the trust just referred to the maximum extent allowed by law. 
However= I have added a provision allowing the trustees to amend the perpetuities provision as long as the amendment 
does not violate any ap=licable rule against perpetuities. I don't think it's much of an issue in a=y event because Abigail 
and Renee could effectively modify the perpetuities=limitation to the extent allowed by law by exercising their powers 
of appointment. 
8. =nbsp; Article XXII addresses incapacity of a t=ustee, but does not contain provisions for reinstatement of a 
formerly inca=acitated trustee. 
I suppose a trustee who regains capacity c=uld be reappointed. Otherwise, I don't see any real point to trying to 
addr=ss this issue. How do you determine whether someone has regained capacity? What if there is disagreement on 
that issue? It's ba= enough if you need to address those issues to get rid of a trustee, but th=re's no need to make it 
worse by leaving the issues on the table for the fu=ure. 
9. =nbsp; The term "by right of represent=tion" should be defined in Article XXV. 
I have adde= a definition that references New York intestacy law. The underlying issue t=at is lurking here really 
only arises if the person whose issue are being determined is predeceased by all of his or her own children= The issue 
then becomes whether the allocation among the grandchildren is d=ne by individual or by family line. FWIW, the New 
York intestacy statute us=s the same language ("by representation") without actually saying what it means, but my 
understanding is that the all=cation is by family, e.g., if there were two children, each child's family g=ts half, regardless 
of the number of grandchildren in each family (Massachu=etts intestacy law is different in that regard, but it does not 
use the same terminology in that context). A=ain, even if the issue would otherwise arise, Abigail and Renee could 
overr=de that provision through their powers of appointment. 
10. Consider adding the following: decantin=/change of situs provisions, spendthrift clause, confidentiality 
provisions= no contest clause and savings clause. 
There is al=eady a spendthrift clause in Paragraph C of Article XVI. In its current for=, the trust would be 
governed by New York law, so the New York decanting statute would apply. That statute could presumably be us=d to 
change the situs, and I'm not sure it's worth the effort to go beyond t=at. I doubt we could do anything about 
confidentiality, etc., with respect t= Marla beyond whatever is already in the separation agreement, and I don't see a 
great need to deal w=th those issues with respect to Abigail and Renee.
