FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
Trade 3: Leverage the USD/JPY skew: The supposed 
stalling 
of 
Abenomics 
'third-arrow' 
reforms, 
uncertainty on tapering and likely poor investor 
timing in the USD/JPY trade has seen risk reversals 
diverging from spot for much of the second half of 
2013. The current level of divergence, at <1.9% 
percentile over the past decade, is nearing historical 
extremes (chart 4). Since the '08 financial crises there 
had been only two episodes where this occurred, in 
Q1 2012 and Q1 2013, each time followed by a 
strong reversion of risk reversals to spot. 
Beyond historical precedent, we see two drivers that 
may propel risk-reversals higher. A steepening of the 
US yields and further traction of Abenomics would 
argue for a firmer spot-risk-reversal correlation in the 
near term, as uncertainty in both whiplashed riskies 
for much of H2. Furthermore, if spot moves higher in 
line with our forecasts, the impact of hedging of 
structured notes should then become a stronger 
driver of mid to back-end risk-reversals. The most 
important driver here is outstanding 25-30Y Power-
Reverse Dual Currency notes, of which we estimate a 
sizable portion with knock-outs are centered around 
the 112.5-120.0 bucket. Risk reversals should then 
find support as demand-supply imbalances are 
reduced from lesser hedging requirements. 
We thus recommend USD/JPY options that buy the 
risk reversal targeting the 6M-12M tenors. Consider a 
9-month USD/JPY 109 call funded by selling a 
102/91.50 RKI put for zero cost off spot ref 104.40. 
Trade 4: Lower USD-CAD beta Implied correlation 
between AUD/USD and AUD/CAD has remained 
elevated (-86% percentile), which provides sizable 
cheapening to AUD/USD puts by selling correlation. 
This relationship relates to CAD being perceived as a 
USD substitute, which we think will not be the case 
as Fed tapering spurs bond repatriation and 
underscores policy divergence between the two. 
Thus, consider a 6M AUD/USD 0.86 put with an 
AUD/CAD 0.83 cross knock-out indicatively for 
136bps versus 190bps for the vanilla, off spot refs 
0.8920 (-3.6% from strike) and 0.9580 (-13.4% from 
the barrier). 
Empirically, since the 1983 AUD floatation AUD/CAD 
dips have been more constrained than AUD/USD, 
unsurprisingly given the broad dollar response and 
cyclical co-sensitivity of commodities (see highlights 
in chart 3). Historically, a -3.6% AUD/USD put with 
an -13.4% AUD/CAD KO would have been in-the-
money 26.2% of the time, and knocked out 2.7% of 
the time.
