imposes a duty on the sex offender to register, it nowhere imposes a requirement on the State to 
accept such registration. Indeed, the criminal provisions of SORNA also recognize that a State 
can refuse registration inasmuch as they allow, as an affirmative defense to a prosecution, the 
claim that "uncontrollable circumstances prevented the individual from complying." 18 U.S.C. § 
2250(b)(1). Of course, if a State elects not to participate in the implementation of SORNA, it 
risks losing some funding. See 42 U.S.C. § 16925(a). But it is well established that conditioning 
federal funding on a State's implementation of a federal program does not, without more, violate 
the Tenth Amendment. See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 210-11 (1987). 
Moreover, even if Kennedy were able to demonstrate facts or circumstances raising the specter of 
an unconstitutional commandeering, it would be the State, not him, that would be aggrieved, and 
in presenting the State's claim, Kennedy undoubtedly would face a serious standing question, as 
the government has suggested in its brief. See, e.g., United States v. Hacker, 565 F.3d 522, 526-
27 (8th Cir.2009) (holding that an individual has no standing to challenge SORNA on the 
ground that it improperly commandeers state officials in violation of the Tenth Amendment); 
United States v. Shenandoah, 595 F.3d 151, 161-62 (3d Cir.2010) (following Hacker); Brooklyn 
Legal Servs. Corp. B v. Legal Servs. Corp., 462 F.3d 219, 234-36 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that 
an individual does not have standing to bring a Tenth Amendment claim); Medeiros v. Vincent, 
431 F.3d 25, 33-36 (1st Cir.2005) (same); United States v. Parker, 362 F.3d 1279, 1284-85 
(10th Cir.2004) (same). But see Gillespie v. City of Indianapolis, 185 F.3d 693, 700-04 (7th 
Cir.I999) (holding that individuals have standing to bring a Tenth Amendment claim); Atlanta 
Gas Light Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Energy, 666 F.2d 1359, 1368 n. 16 (11th Cir.1982) (same). But 
Kennedy has not even established a plausible claim under the Tenth Amendment, and we 
therefore need not consider the government's standing argument.'-
We thus conclude that Kennedy has failed to demonstrate that either the special parole condition 
imposed on him or SORNA itself raises a Tenth Amendment problem.

Accordingly, we vacate our prior opinion in this case and, for the reasons given herein, affirm the 
district court's judgment. 
AFFIRMED 
FOOTNOTES 
1. These and other provisions regarding parole from federal convictions, 18 U.S.C. §§ 4201-
4218, were repealed by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Title II, ch. II of Pub.L. 98-473, § 
218(a)(5), 98 Stat. 1837, 2027, but remain in effect for individuals convicted of an offense 
before the effective date of the repeal, id. § 235(b); United States Parole Commission Extension 
Act of 2008, Pub.L. No. 110-312, § 2, 122 Stat. 3013, 3013. 
2. Kennedy also made several other challenges to SORNA-namely, that SORNA exceeds 
Congress' power under the Commerce Clause and that the Attorney General violated the 
Administrative Procedure Act by promulgating the interim regulation making SORNA 
retroactive without notice and comment-but those challenges have since both been rejected by 
United States v. Gould, 568 F.3d 459, 461 (4th Cir.2009).
