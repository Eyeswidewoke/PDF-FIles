FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
Theme 1t4: - Swiss NOK'd-out 
We can think of three reasons to go short CHF/N0K. 
1. The relative cycle is supportive of rate differentials. 
Inflation is at a much higher starting point in Norway 
than in Switzerland, leaving the Norges Bank much less 
room to manoeuvre than the SNB in the event of 
upside surprises to import prices or stronger European 
growth. Market pricing in Norway has evolved rapidly 
from three months ago, with the first hike now 
expected in 03 2015 rather than 01 2014, more or less 
in line with the Norges' own projections. N0K is also 
much better placed to benefit from a stronger US cycle 
with one of the strongest correlations to US growth, 
and CHF one of the weakest. One risk is house prices, 
which have risen precipitately in Norway over the last 
five years, a sharp reversal of which could weigh on 
domestic demand and prompt Norges' dovishness. We 
think the risks of this are slim, however, (see theme #6). 
and moderate falls will be welcomed by the central 
bank as skimming froth from the market. 
2. Swiss safe-haven unwind should follow Norway's. 
Like Switzerland, Norway experienced large-scale safe 
haven inflows as a consequence of the financial crisis, 
helping to pause customary current account surplus 
recycling. In the latter's case, these inflows have 
largely reversed, to the tune of N0K 190bn on a 2y/2y 
basis). This has been one of the primary recent drags 
on the krone, but appears to have largely run its course, 
in contrast to Switzerland where it has yet to begin. 
3. CHF also more vulnerable to domestic outflows. 
As well as the foreign inflow, Norway and Switzerland 
both saw significant repatriation of domestic assets 
from abroad. Again, this flow has long turned in 
Norway but not yet in Switzerland. One possible 
catalyst will be stronger price pressures next year on 
the back of more robust growth. This should erode real 
returns Swiss domestics have enjoyed on already some 
of the most expensive assets in the world. Historically, 
Swiss capital flows have been counter-cyclically related 
to prices (chart 3). Indeed, CHF performance closely 
tracked changes in real yields last year. By contrast, 
while conventional Norwegian outflows have resumed, 
N0K is more protected by surplus savings being 
invested by the oil fund. 
Along with the above, CHF/NOK appears fundamentally 
misaligned with traditional drivers like oil/gold. Finally, 
the trade benefits from being USD and EUR/USD 
neutral (with a 15 year correlation of 16% and -11% 
respectively).
