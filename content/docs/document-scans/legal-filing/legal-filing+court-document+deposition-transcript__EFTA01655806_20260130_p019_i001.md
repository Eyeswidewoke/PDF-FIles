. The Heritage Foundation: Seizing the Moment to Defeat DEI — Wednesday, March 13, 2024. Location: The 
Heritage Foundation, 9:30 AM. The successful campaign to oust the presidents of Harvard University and the 
University of Pennsylvania has made clear that a window of opportunity has opened in the struggle against 
DEI and CRT. This window opened when Americans, especially those in the center, watched in horror as 
students — indoctrinated into a narrative of oppressor vs. oppressed — threw their support behind the Hamas 
terrorists who committed atrocities in Israel on October 7. We must keep this window open. Join us to hear 
from experts in national defense, medicine, and education, along with journalists uncovering DEI and CRT's 
capture of a wide range of institutions. From medical schools to the military and law schools to corporations, 
see how this pernicious ideology has made its way into every facet of American institutions and what can be 
done to reverse course. This half-day event will begin with a fireside chat between Congressman Burgess 
Owens and Heritage Vice President Eric Teetsel.
