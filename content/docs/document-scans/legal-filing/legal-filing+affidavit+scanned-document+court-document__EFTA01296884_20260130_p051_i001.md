44 Misc. 3d 280, *; 982 N.Y.S.2d 868, "; 
2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1404, ***; 2014 NY Slip Op 24083 
that Bums withheld the sum of approximately $40,000 (as of the date of the amended 
complaint) in partial distributions due to them from the sale of the 2784 premises. Plaintiffs 
asserted that Burns, as the manager of 2784 LLC, owed them a fiduciary duty as members 
of 2784 LLC. 
Plaintiffs' amended complaint alleged three causes of action. Plaintiffs' first cause of action 
against Burns and 2784 LLC sought an accounting of the affairs and monies of 2784 LLC. 
Plaintiffs' second cause of action against Burns alleged that Burns diverted monies 
belonging to 2784 LLC and withheld distributions due to them from the sale of the 2784 
premises, which constituted a breach of his fiduciary duties to them. It sought a judgment 
['..9] surcharging Burns in the amounts which are determined to be improperly diverted, 
converted, and/or misappropriated. Plaintiffs' third cause of action against the McRory 
defendants sought a judgment requiring them to disgorge all legal fees paid to them by 
2784 LLC which were unrelated to 2784 LLC. 
On September 15, 2011, Burns served an answer to plaintiffs' amended complaint, which 
denied its material allegations and raised four affirmative defenses. Burns' first affirmative 
defense alleged that plaintiffs' amended complaint fails to state a cause of action. Burns' 
second affirmative ["873] defense alleged that the court should not proceed in the 
absence of persons who should be parties. Burns' third affirmative defense alleged that 
Benevento has no standing and is not a proper party to this action as he is a co-executor 
acting without authority in relation to the estate of Julia, who was the member of 2784 LLC, 
and that Neary has no standing and is not a proper party to this action as he is a member 
of a group called the Neary group that is the member of 2784 LLC. Burns' third affirmative 
defense further alleged that plaintiffs' amended complaint should be dismissed for failure 
to join indispensable r""10] parties. Bums' fourth affirmative defense alleged that the 
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims. 
Following discussions with the attorneys for the McRory defendants and limited document 
production by them, plaintiffs, by a stipulation of discontinuance dated January 27, 2012, 
p287] discontinued this action as against the McRory defendants. On February 23, 2012, 
Grace (who, as noted above, was Burns' mother and a member of 2784 LLC) died at the 
age of 99 years. 
By notice of motion dated March 6, 2013, plaintiffs moved for a default judgment, pursuant 
to CPLR 3215, against 2784 LLC. On April 4, 2013, plaintiffs withdrew that motion and 
extended the time for 2784 LLC to serve an answer to their amended complaint in 
exchange for its production of bank statements for its checking account, which 2784 LLC 
produced in or about the end of May 2013. 2784 LLC has not yet interposed an answer to 
plaintiffs' amended complaint. 
On June 28, 2013, Burns produced some documents in response to a February 25, 2013 
notice to produce for discovery and inspection which was served by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs 
assert that their review of 2784 LLC's bank statements and other documents produced 
r .., 
in this action have revealed that they have direct claims against Burns and 2784 
LLC for the alleged wrongful withholding from them of over $80,000 in distributions due to 
them from the net sale proceeds from the 2784 premises.
