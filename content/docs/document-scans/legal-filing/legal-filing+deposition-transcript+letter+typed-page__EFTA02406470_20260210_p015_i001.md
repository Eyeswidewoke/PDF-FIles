This is in line wit= Hamas' gradual slide into a more pragmatic political posture over the p=st decade. During this time 
the movement has declared its willingness to a=cept a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza and coexistence with 
Israel, if the principles of the 2002 A=ab Peace Plan are adopted and the Palestine refugee issue is resolved equi=ably. 
Hamas has also signaled a willingness to abandon the armed struggle =n favor of nonviolent resistance against Israel, 
and to agree to a long-term truce with Israel under certai= conditions. 
At another level, H=mas' decision to leave Syria reflects ongoing internal divisions within =he movement. Islamist 
organizations, in the final analysis, experience the=same dynamics as any grouping of diverse people united by a 
common cause, but also divided over the many options th=y have to achieve their goals. 
We can see this in =he different tactical strands among Hamas officials vis-a-vis the reconc=liation with Fatah. The 
implications of these various views over issues su=h as negotiations with or recognition of Israel, power-sharing with 
Fatah, relations with Iran, or support for A=ab uprisings across the region — which range from hard-line absolutism t= a 
more accommodating pragmatism — are that groups like Hamas operate ac=ording to a domestic political calculus of 
survival that ultimately overrides other forces. 
This is also seen i= the quiet debate within llamas about whether to consolidate its power base=in Gaza and make do 
with a diminutive Palestinian statelet that makes litt=e sense to anyone other than Hamas operatives; or to rejoin and 
reconfigure Palestinian national institutions=such as the Palestine Liberation Organization, to continue the struggle 
na=ionally and regionally. 
This raises the thi=d level of analysis of Hamas' decision, which relates to the condition o= that grouping of states and 
movements called the Resistance and Deterrenc= Front — namely Syria, Hezbollah, Iran and Hamas. These four partners 
have always been fascinating for several re=sons, including their ability to transcend traditional divides in the Midd=e 
East, such as Sunni-Shiite, Arab-Iranian, and religious-secular divides.=/span> 
Hamas' decision t= turn against Damascus is a blow to the Front, but probably a minor one fo= now, in a volatile region. 
The Syrian government is under intense pressur= at home and abroad, and may not survive in its present form. The 
Iranian government faces its own vulnerabilities =t home and globally, and continues to be the major regional loser from 
the=Arab uprisings. 
Hezbollah in Lebano= — probably the strongest member of the front in the short term — must=be working overtime to 
calculate how it should respond to possible scenari=s on the horizon (the fall of the Assad regime, an attack on Iran, a 
revival of the Green Movement in Iran, an Ira=ian-Western nuclear agreement, and so on). 
Hamas and Syria are=the most vulnerable members of the Resistance and Deterrence Front these d=ys. How Hamas 
plays its cards in the months ahead probably will not have a=major impact on the region as a whole, because the 
movement has become a relatively minor and constrained actor i= its Gaze fiefdom. Syria's impact on the region would 
be much greater, s=ould the regime change, or only alter its policies. For now, we can only c=nclude two things: The 
Resistance and Deterrence Front, like any political construct, is vulnerable to chang=; and, Islamist movements such as 
Hamas will make political decisions base= on pragmatism and realism as much as on ideological purity and absolutism= 
The changes under w=y in the region are a logical step in the ongoing reconfiguration of power=relationships in the 
Middle East, following the first year of the Arab upr=sings. Hamas' reversal on Syria is an important example of how 
Islamist groups continue to make the transitio= from their previous world of abstract political opposition and often 
bloo=y and costly resistance, to the new environment in which they must grapple=more convincingly with real-world 
conditions and options, especially the spreading advent of populist legiti=acy and accountability in Arab countries. 
Two of the four mem=ers of the Resistance and Deterrence Front have been hit by the Arab upris=ngs. Others will follow 
in due course.
