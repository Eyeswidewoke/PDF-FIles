2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82496, * 
breach of the good faith obligation is a finding of improper motive. 'Wthout bad motive or 
intention, discretionary decisions that happen to result in economic disadvantage to the 
other party are of no legal significance."' Bartell° v. Option One Mortgage Corp., No. A-
2492-0771, 2009 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 264, 2009 WL 137229, at *4 (N.J. Super. Ct. 
App. Div. Jan. 22, 2009) (quoting Wilson, 168 N.J. at 251). 
It is undisputed here that Statebridge retained discretionary authority to choose a force-
placed insurance provider. However, the implied covenant of good faith precluded 
Defendants from exercising that discretion "unreasonably . . . with the objective of 
preventing the other party from receiving its reasonably expected fruits under the contract." 
Statebridge argues that Plaintiff cannot meet this standard, because he has failed to allege 
sufficient facts showing that Statebridge deprived him of the benefit of his bargain. (SMTD 
32-37) 
In support of this position, Statebridge quotes Bartell°, 2009 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 
264, 2009 WL 137229, at •5: 
The benefit of (plaintiffis bargain under t291 the mortgage agreement was to obtain a loan to purchase a home. By 
allowing the loan to remain in effect. and enabling (plaintiff] to keep his home, although paying a somewhat higher 
insurance premium because he failed to keep his own insurance in effect. (defendant] can hardly be said to have taken 
action depriving [plaintiff) of the benefit of his bargain. 
(SMTD 32) In other words, Plaintiff signed the Mortgage Agreement to obtain a loan to 
purchase a home and received that loan, so he cannot now claim a breach of the implied 
covenant of good faith. 
However, this characterization of Plaintiff's bargain is incomplete.0 In denying a motion to 
dismiss plaintiff's claim for breach of an implied covenant, the Court in Laffan v. Santander 
Bank N.A., No. CIV.A. 13-4040, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79915, 2014 WL 2693158 (E.D. 
Pa. June 12, 2014)) observed the following: 
The purpose of a clause in a mortgage allowing a lender to force-place insurance is to protect the lenders interest in 
the property that is collateral for the mortgage. Plaintiff claims that [Defendant] made additional profits at his expense 
by force-placing insurance on his property and receiving kickbacks on that insurance. rather than placing insurance to 
protect its interest in the property. While the mortgage did not require (Defendant] to place r30] the cheapest 
insurance available. it was not entitled to use its discretion to obtain secret kickbacks(.1 
Laffan, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79915, 2014 WL 2693158 at *5. 
12 Bartell° is also not as factually similar to the instant matter as Statebridge suggests. Despite invoking force-placed 
insurance. Bartell° involved no allegations of fraud and kickbacks. as alleged here. only a dispute over the coverage the force-
placed instance provided. 
Similarly here, while Statebridge was allowed to forceplace insurance "to protect the 
lender's interest in the property," Statebridge "was not entitled to use its discretion to 
obtain secret kickbacks." Defendants had the discretion to force-place insurance at a price 
to be determined by the market, but they were required to exercise that discretion 
reasonably. Artificially inflating that price to benefit themselves through undisclosed 
kickbacks, as Plaintiff has alleged, would qualify as an "unreasonable" exercise of their 
discretion and would therefore breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
