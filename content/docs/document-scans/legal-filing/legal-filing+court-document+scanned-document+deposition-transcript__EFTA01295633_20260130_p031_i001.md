13 The record does indicate that "supervisory positions" are not typically posted for bidding under the Nucor hiring policy. J.A. 
257. Neither Nucor nor the district court, however, has provided any reason to believe that any of the 27 records at issue 
describe open supervisory jobs, as Nucor defined the term, and were thus not posted. Furthermore, the dissent suggests that 
there may have been isolated instances when Nucor did not follow its posting policy for non-supervisory jobs. The fact that a 
company does not follow its policy to r301 a tee. however, does not fatally undermine a statistical assumption based upon 
such a policy.

With the alternative benchmark evidence included, the statistical disparity in promotions is 
statistically significant at 2.54 standard deviations from what would be expected if race 
were a neutral factor. See Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 308 n. 14, 
97 S. Ct. 2736, 53 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1977) (indicating that anything greater than two or three 
standard deviations in racial discrimination cases is suspicious, at least for large sample 
sizes); Brown I, 576 F.3d at 156 n.9 (applying the Hazelwood standard to the workers' 
statistical evidence); Jones v. City of Boston, 752 F.3d 38, 46-47 (1st Cir. 2014) (observing 
that two standard deviations has become the commonly accepted threshold for social 
scientists and federal courts "in analyzing statistical showings of disparate impact"). 
According to the experts' analysis, black employees constitute 19.24% of those who 
applied for relevant promotions. Yet such employees were only 7.94% percent of those 
promoted. 
Of course, [HN141 statistical significance is not always synonymous with legal 
significance. EEOC v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Richmond, 698 F.2d 633, 648 (4th Cir. 1983) 
rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Cooper v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S. 
867, 104 S. Ct. 2794, 81 L. Ed. 2d 718 (1984). Indeed, the usefulness of statistical 
evidence often "depends on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances." Teamsters, 
431 U.S. at 340. Here, the surrounding circumstances and anecdotal evidence of 
discrimination, ("31] as described in greater detail below, are precisely what help animate 
the statistical findings.- As we held in Brown I and reaffirm today, "because the appellants' 
direct evidence alone was sufficient to demonstrate common claims of disparate treatment 
and disparate impact, their statistical data did not need to meet a two-standard-deviation 
threshold." Brown I, 576 F.3d at 156-57. Thus it is plain that when the statistical disparity 
actually exceeded two standard deviations, the district court abused its discretion in 
decertifying the class. 
14 Indeed. the workers statistical analysis may actually underestimate the impact of race on promotions at Nucor. As worker 
Erie Conyers stated in his declaration: "If I believed that a truly level playing field existed at the company I would have bid on 
numerous other positions such as Roll Gtide Builder in the Beam Will." J.A 1079. But the expert analysis at issue could not 
capture the impact of discrimination on depressed bidding rates. 
B. 
The district court further concluded that the workers' statistical and anecdotal ['9O9] 
evidence was insufficient for class certification insofar as the evidence did not demonstrate 
a uniform class-wide injury that spanned the entire Nucor plant. ("32] As the court 
observed, [FIN15] Wal-Mart instructs that plaintiffs must present a common contention 
capable of being proven or disproven in "one stroke" to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality
