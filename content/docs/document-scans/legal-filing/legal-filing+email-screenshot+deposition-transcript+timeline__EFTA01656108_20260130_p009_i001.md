FBI Accuses Suspect of Collecting Cash From Ohio Victim of Elder Fraud Scam 
WFMJ (NBC-21) (11/20, Gauntner) reported that a third suspect appeared before a federal judge in Youngstown 
Monday for his alleged role in a $4.8 million nationwide elder fraud scheme that targeted half a dozen victims 
across the United States including a Salem man. Yash Raval pleaded "not guilty" to a money laundering conspiracy 
indictment unsealed last month. Raval's arrest follows that of 24-year-old Shreyas Baldevbhai Chaudhary, an Indian 
national charged with money laundering conspiracy. The article stated that the scheme involved a sophisticated 
operation where victims were tricked into believing their computers were hacked and their identities stolen. They 
were then pressured to send large sums of money to individuals posing as representatives of Microsoft or their 
financial institutions. Chaudhary is accused of using the fake tech support scam to defraud a 77-year-old man from 
Salem, out of approximately $61,000. Chaudhary allegedly used a messaging account opened with an email 
address linked to a cloud account containing the man's identifying information. The article mentioned that in the 
case of the Salem victim, he was instructed to withdraw cash from his bank account and deliver it to Raval who 
arrived at his home in an SUV in November of last year. What Raval didn't know is that the $50,000 he believed to 
be from the wire fraud scheme was actually cash supplied by the FBI. Six victims were identified with total losses 
exceeding $4.8 million. In addition to two people from Ohio, there are also victims from California, New York,
