This action, however, seems incompatible with the views e=pressed by Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al-Thani, 
Qatar's prime minist=r and foreign minister in Washington, on April 29, 2013. He then not only spoke of general support 
for the=2002 Saudi Arabian peace proposal and negotiations between the two parties= but also suggested compromises 
"comparable and mutually agreed minor=exchanges" of land. This was a position not espoused by the Palestinians. 
Noticeably, Al-Thani specifically =id not mention Jerusalem or the Palestinian refugee issue. By taking this =iewpoint, 
Qatar is implicitly assuming that the 1967 armistice lines, with=minor changes, will be the borders of a new Palestinian 
state. While the particular way in which the propo=al has been framed may not be completely acceptable to the Israelis, 
it is=contradictory to the position of the Palestinians who insist, as a minimum= on Israel's return to the 1948 lines. In 
addition to the differences over Al-Thani's statement, Qatar's re=ationship with Hamas and its policy towards the feud 
between Fatah and Ham=s is also not defined. 
What is clear is that Qatar's influence is being taken se=iously. That Qatar is now regarded as an important player was 
notice=ble when Afghan president Hamid Karzai visited the emir to discuss prospects of peace in Afghanistan, and to 
seek the emi='s help in dealing with the Taliban. The question for the United Stares and for Israel is how in their own 
policy-making to reconcile the vario=s and seemingly incompatible policies of Qatar. On the one hand, Qatar is a 
supporter of Islamist beliefs =nd parties, as a country with a seemingly cordial relationship with Hamas =n Gaza and a 
more ambiguous but generally friendly one with Saudi Arabia. =nbsp;On the other hand, it has established ties with the 
U.S. and European countries through involvement in the econo=ies of the West. It also appears willing to encourage the 
Arabs to s=rive for peace with Israel. As a small but wealthy emirate in the tu=bulent Middle East, perhaps Qatar is 
seeking to secure a safe position by assuming a role in the economy and politics o= the world. 
The Western countries are confronte= with the question of whether they are capable of dealing with the uncerta=nties, 
mysteries, and doubts about Arab policies. Whatever the answer, Qatar is now to be taken serious=y by the United 
States and Israel.

but some in Hezbollah <http://www.al-monitor.com/pulre/contents/articles/politics/2013/04/saudi-arabia-

During that period, the Qataris often reiterated that the=smaller Arab nations had a problem with their larger neighbors
