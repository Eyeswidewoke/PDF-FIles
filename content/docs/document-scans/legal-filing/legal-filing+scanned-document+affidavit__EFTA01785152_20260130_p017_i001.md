Sandel: 
Grayling: I'm very sympathetic to that view but I can hear two different kinds =f critics responding to it. One critic might 
say that the best kind of society from the point of view of the individual=flourishing is the minimalist society. This might 
be your bog standard Rep=blican who wants government to get out of the way. 
In the other direction you might have someone say that a good=society is one that compensates for the failings of the 
individuals within=in it. Famously, Churchill said democracy was the least bad of a lot of bad systems. But he also said 
that the stron=est argument against democracy was two minutes of conversation with any vo=er. 
Sandel: 
Grayling: That's very interesting. We must come back to it because of course in=your discussion of the marketisation of 
society in What Money Can't Buy, you end by pointing out how corrupting=of our civic life it would be if everything 
could be bought or sold. 
Before we do, the motivation for what you say in that argumen= is predicated on the disenchantment you have with 
economics and economist=. Perhaps you could explain what it is about them that has made you fed up. 
Sandel= Some of my best friends are economists. When I started graduate school, l=started out thinking I would do PPE 
and study philosophy and economics since I'd studied politics before. My pro=ect with economics was to see if I could 
include within the economic model=a concern for equality, or whether equality as a normative consideration h=d to be 
brought in from outside those models. So I strayed from that project, although I feel like I've come b=ck to it, in a way, 
35 years later. 
In the old days, back with Adam Smith and the classical econo=ists, economics was understood, I think rightly, as a 
branch of moral and =olitical philosophy. In the 20th century, economics established itself as an autonomous discipline 
and presented its=lf as a value-neutral science of social life and human behaviour. This is =ow economics is largely 
taught today. 
I think it's a mistake to view economics as a science. When=economics concerns itself with traditional economic topics, 
such as employ=ent, inflation, how to avoid recession, foreign trade, banks and stocks, then it is easy enough to see how 
it's =ossible to think of economics that way. But when economics enlarges it's=ambition and undertakes to explain the 
whole of life, then I think it's =ess and less plausible to think of it as a value-neutral science. 
When economic reasoning and markets govern not just things li=e toasters and cars but family life, personal relations, 
health, education=and civic life—when economics tries to explain and inform every domain of life—then it has to enter 
into morall= contestable choices, although it does so often without fully owning up to=it. 
Economists often assume that markets are inert, that they don=92t touch or taint the goods they exchange, and this 
may be true enough if=we're talking about material goods. If you give me a flat-screen television or sell me one, the flat-
screen telev=sion will work just as well either way. But the same may not be true when =t comes to using market 
mechanisms or cash incentives, for example, to mot=vate young students to study harder. Cash for good grades or high 
test scores—many US schools districts have =ried this as an experiment. In Dallas, Texas they pay eight-year-olds $2 f=r 
each book they read. From the standpoint of traditional economic analysi=, the only test is: does it work? Does the 
number of books read increase? What has actually happened is that=the grades have not increased in most of these 
experiments.<=span> 
But the real question is: what lesson is being taught by offe=ing cash for grades or studying? My worry is that the lesson 
being taught =s that reading is a chore, the kind of work to be done for money. And if that's what's being taught, the 
mark=t mechanism is not neutral—it changes the meaning of the activity and cr=wds out attitudes and norms that we 
care about.
