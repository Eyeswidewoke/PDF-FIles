Fees and Charges 
As a client of UBS, you agree to pay all fees and charges relating to your Accounts for any 
transactions or services you receive from us, such as annual service fees, brokerage fees for 
securities transactions, fees for specific services you request, IRA custodial account fees and 
fees or charges by a third party that we incur in the course of providing services to you. 
All fees and charges are subject to change at any time. Fees and charges will be charged to 
your Accounts and may be satisfied, along with any other amounts you owe us, from free 
credit balances, margin and other assets in any of your Accounts. We may sell assets in your 
Account to satisfy debit balances for any amounts due, including those resulting from unpaid 
fees and charges. 
Joint Accounts 
For joint accounts, each person or entity named on the Account has full power and authority 
over the Account, and the account holders are jointly and severally liable for all obligations 
with respect to the Account. Please refer to the "Joint Accounts" section of the General Terms 
and Conditions of the Agreements and Disclosures booklet for more information about the 
terms and conditions that apply to joint accounts.

from time to time.

The Agreements and Disclosures booklet contains the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements and the 
IRA Disdosure Statements that apply to any Traditional, Roth, SEP or SIMPLE Individual 
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you open with us now or in the future. If we make changes to the 
UBS IRA Custodial Agreement and the IRA Disclosure Statement, we will notify you of the 
updates and you agree to be subject to those updated terms and conditions. 
According to the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements, UBS Financial Services Inc. is named as the 
custodian of your IRA when we accept the Account. 
Beneficiaries must be named in writing. You may apply your written beneficiary designation to 
your future IRA accounts, and in that case, we will confirm your designation. If you do not 
designate beneficiaries, or your beneficiary designation does not effectively dispose of the 
assets, your beneficiary with respect to the IRA or any part of the IRA not effectively disposed 
of, will be your surviving spouse, or your estate if you do not have a surviving spouse. If you 
designate a spouse as your beneficiary, the subsequent divorce or termination of the marriage 
will automatically revoke the designation. You can designate your former spouse as 
beneficiary by completing a new change of beneficiary form. 
If your IRA account is funded via transfer from another financial institution, you represent that 
all transfers to such Account originate from: (1) an IRA in the same name and of the same type 
(e.g. traditional, Roth); (2) an inherited IRA in the same name and of the same type; or (3) a 
qualified plan account that you were entitled to rollover to an IRA. 
Please refer to the Fees and Charges 
section of the Agreements and Disclosures 
booklet and the Understanding our fees, 
charges and other compensation brochure 
which is available at 
www.ubs.corn/accountdisclosures for more 
information about fees and charges. If you 
have questions, please contact your 
Financial Advisor. 
The features and fees of your International 
Resource Management Account are more 
fully described in the Agreements and 
Disclosures booklet. 
The features and fees of your IRA are fully 
described in the Agreements and 
Disclosures booklet. 
Please note: UBS does not extend margin 
for Individual Retirement Accounts. 
Employers with a SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA 
plan for their businesses must sign a 
separate plan document. We accept any 
approved plan documents, known as 
prototypes, whether they were produced 
by UBS, an IRS model or a document from 
another provider. If you would like to use a 
UBS prototype, please ask fora copy of the 
SEP IRA Plan or SIMPLE IRA Plan prototype 
document from your UBS financial Advisor.
