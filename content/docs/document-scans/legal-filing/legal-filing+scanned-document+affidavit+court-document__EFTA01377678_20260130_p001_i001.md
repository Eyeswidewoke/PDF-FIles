S-1/A 
experience an inherent trade-off between the size of our sellers and our transaction revenue as a percentage of GPV because we 
selectively offer custom pricing to larger sellers. 
Global adoption. 
We believe we are well positioned to enter additional markets globally, including through our ability to 
provide modern, cost-effective hardware to markets that have embraced NFC or EMV technologies. We plan to continue expanding 
into new countries to broaden our base of sellers and to increase our market opportunity. In doing so. we may need to invest 
significantly, which could have negative effects on our operating results. 
Buyer adoption of our services. 
We offer services that directly reach buyers. Today, our digital receipts provide a unique 
link between sellers and buyers—any time a buyer completes a sale with a Square seller, he or she can choose to receive a digital 
receipt via email or text message, building a direct communication channel. In 2014, we sent 147 million digital receipts; for the 
nine months ended September 30, 2015, we sent nearly 170 million digital receipts, representing 64% growth over the same period 
last year. We currently see more than 1.6 million monthly feedback communications sent by buyers to sellers through digital 
receipts. We also offer Caviar. Square Cash, and other services to make commerce easy for buyers. We have made significant 
investments in the development of these buyer-facing products and services, and our ability to grow our buyer network will be 
important for strengthening our ecosystem and driving our growth. 
Amendment and expiration of Starbucks payment processing agreement. In the third quarter of 2012, we signed an 
agreement to process credit and debit card payment transactions for all Starbucks-owned stores in the United States. We believe 
this agreement was a valuable catalyst for building best-in-class enterprise infrastructure. For the nine months ended September 
30, 2015, and the year ended December 31, 2014, the gross loss related to our payment processing agreement with Starbucks 
was S23.3 million and $27.9 million, respectively. In August 2015, we amended our payment processing agreement with Starbucks 
to eliminate the exclusivity provision in order to permit Starbucks to begin transitioning to another payment processor starting 
October 1, 2015. Under the amendment, Starbucks also agreed to pay increased processing rates to us for as long as they 
continue to process transactions with us. Starbucks has announced that it will transition to another payment processor and will 
cease using our payment processing services altogether prior to the scheduled expiration of the agreement in the third quarter of 
2016. As a result, Starbucks payment processing volumes will decrease meaningfully in the future. This transition will result in 
decreased Starbucks transaction revenue and Starbucks transaction costs, positively affecting our overall gross profit. Because we 
will cease to provide payment processing services to Starbucks in the future, and because the payment processing agreement's 
historical terms are not representative of future economics, we believe it is useful to exclude Starbucks activity to clearly show the 
impact Starbucks has had on our financial results historically, to provide insight into the impact of the termination of the Starbucks 
agreement on our revenues going forward, to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our business, and to facilitate comparisons 
of our performance to that of other payment processors. 
Effect of pricing initiatives for our payment processing services. Since February 2011, our standard model for payments 
services has remained stable at 2.75% of the total transaction amount for processing card-present transactions, and 3.5% of the 
total transaction amount plus $0.15 per transaction for card-not-present transactions. Notwithstanding our history of stable pricing 
for our payments services, we face competition across our payments services. We have introduced pricing programs to attract 
newer larger customers, such as our current custom pricing program (introduced in November 
69 
Table of Contents 
2013). Our custom pricing initiative affects a small but fast growing portion of our sellers and represents an opportunity for 
incremental growth. To the extent competition for sellers increases, particularly for those that are offered custom pricing, our rate of 
growth and margins may be adversely affected. 
Macroeconomic environment. 
Our sellers' underlying business activity from buyers is linked to the macroeconomic 
environment, affecting our transaction revenue as well as the adoption of additional services by our sellers. 
Components of Results of Operations 
Revenue 
Transaction revenue. 
We charge our sellers a transaction fee for payment processing services equal to 2.75% of the total 
transaction amount for processing card-present transactions and for processing payments with Square Invoices, and 3.5% of the 
total transaction amount plus $0.15 per transaction for processing manually entered (card-not-present) transactions. We also 
selectively offer custom pricing for larger sellers.
