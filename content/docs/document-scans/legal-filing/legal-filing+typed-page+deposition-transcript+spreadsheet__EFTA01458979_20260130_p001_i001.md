Oil: Oil prices are exerting a significant impact on global bond markets. First, 
there is an obvious and very strong correlation between oil prices and the 
inflation risk premium and the term premium. Second, the ECB has now 
introduced a strong link between oil prices and monetary policy. The ECB is 
primarily concerned about a disanchoring of inflation expectations, i.e. the risk 
that persistently low spot inflation feeds into inflation expectations. In that 
respect, the ECB is less focused on why spot inflation is low (supply or 
demand factors, temporary or permanent) and inclined to react if spot inflation 
remains too low for too long. Given that spot inflation is itself largely 
determined by oil prices, there is an obvious link between the latter and the 
ECB's policy decisions. Our oil strategists see potential downside risks to oil 
prices in the short term, but are more positive for the medium-term outlook 
from a supply/demand perspective. The turn in oil prices, when it occurs, is 
likely to signal both a normalization of the term premium in bond markets and 
underperformance of European fixed income. Conversely, continued decline in 
oil prices would delay any prospects of an ECB tapering and further slow the 
pace of rate hikes in the US. 
Fiscal and teguloton. policies. The past few years have been marked by a policy 
mix which was relying on monetary policy to (over?) compensate for tighter 
fiscal and regulatory policies. While the regulatory pressures remain strong, 
there has been a shift in the fiscal outlook. Indeed, not only have fiscal policies 
in Europe and the US turned neutral, but there are arguably some upside risks 
over the next couple of years. In the US, the latest budget agreement has 
incorporated a small fiscal stimulus. The upcoming presidential election could 
also open the way for a more constructive dynamics between Congress and 
the Presidency. In Europe, the refugee crisis and the renewed focus on security 
will also skew the risks towards more fiscal easing, above and beyond what is 
recognized in the EC's forecasts. The loosening of fiscal policy is likely to be 
relatively limited in the short term. However, from a medium-term perspective, 
a shift in fiscal policy would be an important driver behind a reassessment of 
monetary policy both in the US and Europe. 
JS 
cyck, Under some metrics, the US credit cycle is already quite 
mature. Credit growth as percentage of GDP has recently averaged 7.5%, in 
the range seen in the late 1990s (6-10%) prior to the 04.07 credit bubble (10-
15%). From this perspective, there are no signs of excess in aggregate, but no 
clear room for improvement either. Given the significant cumulative 
accumulation of inflows into specialized credit bond funds over the last few 
years, there is a clear risk that the policy tightening leads to an unwind of 
these inflows, which would put pressure on credit spreads and in turn could 
lead to a decline in credit growth. This could prompt the Fed to slow the 
tightening process and in an extreme scenario reverse it.
