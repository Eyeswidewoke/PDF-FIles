American Express Business Gold Card 
Subject to these Terms and Conditions, you get at least one Membership Rewards® point for each dollar 
you spend on your Card for eligible purchases. You also get 3 additional points per dollar (for a total of 4 
points), on the 2 categories (of 6) where you spend the most each billing cycle, up to the first S150,000 in 
combined eligible purchases from these 2 categories each calendar year. Eligible purchases in excess of 
S150,000 in a calendar year will receive only one point per dollar spent. 
Determining Your Top 2 Categories 
To calculate your top 2 categories each billing cycle, we use your posted account transactions that fall 
into the 6 categories below and issue additional points based on your 2 highest categories of total spend 
less returns and credits in that same billing cycle. You will only earn 3 additional points in 2 categories 
each billing cycle even if you have equal spend in more than 2 categories. 
The 6 categories that qualify for additional points are: 
• 
Airfare on a scheduled flight charged directly with passenger airlines (charter flights and private 
jet flights are excluded); 
• 
Advertising purchased in the U.S. to promote your business online, on television, or on the 
radio: 
• 
Computer hardware, software, and cloud computing purchases in the U.S. made directly from 
select technology providers (the current list of select technology providers is available at: 
americanexpress.com/rewards-info); 
• 
Gasoline at gas stations located in the U.S. (superstores, supermarkets and warehouse clubs 
that sell gasoline are not considered gas stations); 
• 
Restaurants located in the U.S.; 
• 
Shipping services purchased in the U.S. for courier, postal, and freight.
