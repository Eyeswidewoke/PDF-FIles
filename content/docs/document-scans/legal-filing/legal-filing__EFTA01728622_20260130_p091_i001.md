professional use for sexually explicit images of children. If such individuals do 
have a professional use for the images, but are also showing them to neigh-
borhood children, masturbating with them, or trading them on the Internet in 
sexually oriented newsgroups they can and should be prosecuted. 
The possibilities concerning a child portrayed in pornography and subject's 
state of mind are the sexually explicit image was 
▪ •of a child, but the subject believed it was not a child 
■ not of an actual child, but the subject believed it was a child 
■ of a child, and the subject believed it was a child 
■ of a child, and the subject knew it was a child 
The government certainly has to prove that the offender believed the 
individual portrayed is a child and, therefore, the possibility outlined in the first 
bullet above should not result in conviction. Although the controversial CPPA of 
1996 may not always require it (the possibility outlined in the second bullet above), 
a case has far greater appeal if the government can also prove the image portrays 
an actual child and the subject believed it (the possibility outlined in the third 
bullet above). Under most statutes, the third bullet above should be the standard. 
The burden to prove that the subject knew with certainty the individual por-
trayed is an actual child, the possibility outlined in the fourth bullet above, is an 
impossibly difficult and absurd standard especially in an Internet-collector case. 
If required it would essentially only allow the prosecution of production cases. 
"Expert" Search Warrants 
One controversial and misunderstood application of an offender typology is its 
use in so-called "expert" search warrants. In such search warrants an expert's 
opinion is included in the affidavit to address a particular deficiency. The expert's 
opinion is usually intended to 
■ address legal staleness problems 
■ expand the nature and scope of the search 
for erotica-type material or 
more than one location) or 
■ add to the probable cause 
Addressing staleness and expanding the scope of the search are probably the 
most legally defensible uses of such opinions. Using the expert's opinion as part of 
the probable cause, however, is much more legally questionable and should be 
done only in full awareness of the potential judicial consequences. In spite of the 
legal uncertainties of its application, there is little behavioral doubt that probable 
cause to believe that a given individual is a preferential sex offender is, by 
itself, probable cause to believe that the individual collects pornography or-
paraphernalia related to his preferences, which may or may not include child 
pornography. If it is used, the expert's opinion should be the smallest possible 
percentage of the probable cause. As the portion of the probable cause based 
upon the expert's opinion increases, the expectation of a much more closely scru-• • 
tinized, critical review should increase. 
The affidavit should set forth only those offender characteristics necessary to 
address a specific deficiency. For example if the expert opinion is needed only to
