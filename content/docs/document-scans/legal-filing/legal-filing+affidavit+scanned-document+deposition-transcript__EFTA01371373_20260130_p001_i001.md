2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
twelve separate states, though it accepts the number with hesitation. Plaintiffs' 
submissions meet the Rode standard, providing "fairly definite information as to the hours 
devoted to various general activities." Rode, 892 F.2d at 1190. As discussed, Plaintiffs 
provide a breakdown, by attorney and paralegal, of the hours spent engaging in eleven 
categories of legal work. See, e.g., ECF No. 86-2 Ex. 1. Plaintiffs also provide a 
chronological description of the work performed, collectively, by Class Counsel, including 
the investigation leading up to the drafting and filing of the first complaint, Plaintiffs' 
response to Defendants' motion to dismiss, the drafting of amended complaints, continued 
investigation and discovery, and the negotiations leading to this settlement. See ECF No. 
86 at 7-10. However, Plaintiffs do not provide the specific dates of their services rendered, 
as required by L. Civ. R. 54.2(a)(c). 
Defendants argue, generally, that p731 Plaintiffs' application for fees is insufficient 
because some courts within the Third Circuit have approved attorneys' fees based on 
more detailed documentation than Plaintiffs submit here, including itemized, hourly billing 
records for each attorney. ECF No. 90 at 3-4 (citing cases). Defendants argue specifically 
that the Court should not accept Plaintiffs' aggregate submission of 1,225.5 hours of 
billable work for "Analysis/Strategy/Meetings" without further documentation of the precise 
number of meetings, dates, times, individuals present, and descriptions of "what was 
actually done" at the meetings. ECF No. 90 at 6. The Court does not deny that Plaintiffs 
could submit further documentation, and Plaintiffs have offered to submit detailed time 
records for the Court's in camera review if so required. ECF No. 105 at 6. But "it is not 
necessary" for the Court to "know the exact number of minutes spent nor the precise 
activity to which each hour was devoted nor the specific attainments of each attorney" in 
order to determine whether the number of hours billed was reasonable. Rode, 892 F.2d at 
1190. In any event, as Plaintiffs suggest, "what was actually done" at these meetings likely 
includes protected attorney r74] work product. ECF No. 105 at 9. The Court will not 
require Plaintiffs to submit further documentation of their meetings. 
Defendants also suggest that the 679.1 total hours of "Research" reported by Plaintiffs is 
an unreasonable number because Class Counsel attorneys were already "presumably[ ] 
intimately familiar' with the relevant issues in this matter, reducing their need to conduct 
research. ECF No. 90 at 6-7. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs, however, that "[I]egal 
research is part of the job." ECF No. 105 at 9. Particularly in a multi-state class action 
involving federal and state law statutes, consolidated cases, a motion to dismiss, and an 
amended complaint, Class Counsel is expected to conduct a significant amount of legal 
research. 
Given the lack of individual and task-based detail in Plaintiffs' billing summaries, the Court 
finds that Plaintiffs' submission of 5,100.75 billable hours is reasonable but accepts the 
number with some hesitation. 
d. The billing rates submitted by Plaintiffs are high for the relevant community 
To repeat, the average requested billing rate for Class Counsel attorneys is $664.15 per 
hour, ECF No. 86-9 1128, with individual rates (including for paralegals) ranging p75] from 
$150 to $1,100 per hour. See id. ¶ 30. Partners request a mean rate of $745 per hour, 
while associates request a mean rate of $423 per hour. ECF No. 90 at 9-10. The Court
