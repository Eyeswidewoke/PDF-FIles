of Mississippi. She and Schutt moved to suburban Jackson. She and McMahan didn't speak for 
months. Then, on May 25, 2003, Linda's adoptive father, Laird Hodge, a retired government 
contractor, died in San Diego. Linda and Schutt traveled to the funeral in La Mesa, California. 
McMahan sent flowers and e•mailed Linda his condolences, but they still didn't speak. 
The stress of losing both fathers — Hodge to death, McMahan to indifference — weighed on Linda, 
she testified. It also wrecked her health. From McMahan, she'd inherited a genetic condition called 
Reiter's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the soft tissues and can 
affect the eyes and, more seriously, the heart. Linda had a bad flare-up and developed cataracts 
in both eyes. 
"I became very ill. I was experiencing heart problems and the doctors at the University [of 
Mississippi) Medical Center indicated to me that I would need surgery on my heart," she testified. 
McMahan sent one of his two private planes to ferry her from her home in Mississippi to the Mayo 
Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The treatments she received there helped, and she began to 
recover. Her father insisted that she come to Fisher Island to recuperate so she would have access 
to a spa and to the Argent Center, a posh retreat McMahan had built to entertain his family and his 
billionaire clients. McMahan, she testified, didn't want her to go back to Mississippi or her 
marriage. He wanted her to leave behind the fellowship in clinical and rehabilitative 
neuropsychology, and he persuaded her to come back to work for him. 
"I told him that I had given up opportunities based on his promises to me in the past," she testified. 
"And I told him that he wasn't to abandon his promise to me and that it was to be a strictly normal 
father and daughter relationship." 
She accepted a position as executive vice president of marketing for two of her father's financial 
firms, Argent Funds Group LLC and McMahan Securities. But things didn't stay normal for long. 
"It changed from a loving, supportive father caring for an ill, vulnerable daughter to a 
manipulative, contingency-based rewards/punishment relationship that created my dependence on 
him and gave him control and dominance over me," Linda testified. According to Linda's court 
complaint, McMahan again initiated an incestuous sexual relationship in April 2004 that lasted for 
more than a year. 
In June, the couple flew to London with a twisted plan: to get married where the kings and queens 
of England are crowned. 
We traveled to London for some business, and during that trip Bruce took me to the Westminster 
Abbey and we exchanged vows; Linda testified in her deposition. 
Besides her testimony, there are the cheek-to-cheek photographs documenting this unusual 
ceremony. 
There is little description in court records of how the couple made their ceremony happen in the 
very public church on June 23, 2004. Photographs inside the sanctuary are prohibited, so only the 
two of them would know if there was anything more to it than two well-dressed tourists walking up 
and performing a little ritual during visiting hours. 
They took their photos with the garden of the Little Cloister as a backdrop. In one, they share a 
chaste kiss. 
According to several people close to the litigation, a ceremony at Westminster Abbey made sense 
because McMahan, they say, is an Anglophile who counts among his heroes Adm. Lord Nelson, the 
British naval hero who died in the Battle of Trafalgar. Also, McMahan is said to believe that his 
genes are exemplary and saw in Linda the best match for his own superiority. 
Four days after the ceremony, Linda wrote in an email: "You asked me afterwards if I felt 
different. Near, I don't but at a distance, I do. I am glad about this and feel the insecurities 
slipping away."
