DILUTION 
If you purchase shares of our Class A common stock in this offering, your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of 
the difference between the initial public offering price per share of our Class A common stock in this offering and the pro forma as 
adjusted net tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock immediately after this offering. Dilution in pro forma net 
tangible book value per share to investors purchasing shares of our Class A common stock in this offering represents the 
difference between the amount per share paid by investors purchasing shares of our Class A common stock in this offering and the 
pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock immediately after completion of this offering. 
Our pro forma net tangible book value as of September 30, 2015, was $154.4 million, or $0.52 per share. Our pro forma net 
tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets reduced by the amount of our total liabilities and 
divided by the total number of shares of our Class A common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2015, after giving effect to the 
reclassification of all outstanding shares of our common stock into an equivalent number of shares of our Class B common stock 
and the automatic conversion and reclassification of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock into an aggregate of 
140,552,507 shares of our Class B common stock (including those additional shares issuable upon conversion and reclassification 
of our Series E convertible preferred stock). Such conversion will occur immediately prior to the completion of this offering. 
After giving effect to the sale by us of 25,650,000 shares of our Class A common stock in this offering at the assumed initial 
public offering price of 512.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of 
this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of September 30, 2015, would have been $439.0 million, or $1.36 per 
share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of $0.84 per share to our existing stockholders 
and an immediate dilution in pro forma net tangible book value of $10.64 per share to investors purchasing shares of our Class A 
common stock in this offering. The following table illustrates this dilution: 
Assumed initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock 
Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2015 
$0.52 
Increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share attributable to investors purchasing shares of our 
Class A common stock in this offering 
0.84 
Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock immediately after the 
completion of this offering 
1.36 
Dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share to investors purchasing shares of our Class A common 
stock in this offering 
$12.00 
510.64 
Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the 
estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase or decrease, as applicable, our pro 
forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share to new investors by $0.08, and would increase or decrease, as applicable. 
dilution per share to investors purchasing shares of our Class A common stock in this offering by approximately $0.92, assuming 
the number of shares of our Class A common stock offered by us, as set forth on the cover
