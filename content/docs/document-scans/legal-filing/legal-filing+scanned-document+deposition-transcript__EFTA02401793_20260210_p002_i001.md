Feb 2nd 2013 -- WIT= angry crowds across the nation baying against him, Egypt's president wa=ged his finger at the 
people in a late-night televised speech. He declared=a curfew for some cities, he called for support for the police, he 
deployed the army to the streets. Seemingly as =n afterthought, he added a conciliatory call for dialogue with his 
politic=l opponents. 
As on January 28th =011, so on January 27th 2013. As with President Hosni Mubarak, so with Pre=ident Muhammad 
Morsi. And in both cases to little effect. After both telev=sed addresses vast throngs gleefully defied the curfew, freshly 
deployed soldiers ignored the revellers and the=head of the army warned of a collapsing state, prompting rumours of an 
imm=nent coup. Opposition leaders demanded a government of national unity. Ord=nary citizens braced for the 
unknown. 
The drama that has =een unfolding since January 25th, the anniversary of the beginning of the =prising which toppled 
Mr Mubarak two years ago, would have looked peculiar=y familiar even without the eerily precise coincidence of the 
dates. Some are tempted to see the similarities=carried through to the outcome, hoping that Mr Morsi, a stalwart of the 
Mu=lim Brotherhood and Egypt's first freely elected president, will soon fa=l too. "It is amazing how history 
accelerates," was the catty remark of a prominent defector from the Brot=erhood. "Morsi has got to the point Mubarak 
reached after 30 years in ju=t six months." 
Forbidding ways of =ustom 
But though the situ=tion may seem similar, the country itself has changed a great deal since w=at was at the time seen 
as a revolution (many shy from the term today). Eg=pt's economy has foundered dangerously in the absence of firm 
government policy. Politics has polarised between a= ostensibly empowered Islamist camp and a disgruntled, alienated 
or outrig=t hostile minority that includes much of the educated, urban elite. Amid t=is mess, fearful for the future and 
dispirited by haggling politicians, most Egyptians have little appetit= for another big upheaval. The army, which stepped 
in to shunt Mr Mubarak =side and then lingered too long, is reluctant to dirty its hands again. 
The young hotheads =t the heart of today's protests might like nothing more than to see Mr M=rsi forced into an 
ignominious, Mubarak-like exit. But the broader demand =s for him to change, not to go—to act more like a leader for 
all Egyptians and less like a front man for the Mus=im Brotherhood. The Brotherhood has shed much of the appeal that 
won it va=ious recent elections and tentatively protected it against doubts, not lea=t among foreign powers, about 
Islamist rule. At home its cult of secrecy, hazy pan-Islamic agenda and sense that =t rules by entitlement now provoke 
suspicion and resentment even among man= fellow Islamists. 
Whatever its specif=c focus, the mounting unrest presents an increasingly dangerous challenge =o Egypt's battered and 
creaking state. There would have been protests to=mark the anniversary anyway, but the sentencing to death of 21 
football fans from Port Said on January 26th wou=d them up to a new level of intensity. Football fans have been among 
the m=st eager activists; the judgment on the fans from Port Said, who were held=responsible for the deaths of 72 
people at a game in Cairo last year, sent a crowd swarming to the prison w=ere they were kept. Panicked police opened 
fire, killing 30 people. They f=red again at the mass funeral of those victims, killing yet more. The mix =f seemingly 
twisted justice—the people of Port Said think their fans are being scapegoated—brutally unac=ountable police and 
haughty disdain for working-class provincials revived =recisely the rage that fuelled revolution two years ago. 
Rioters have disrup=ed trains and traffic. Arsonists have attacked buildings used by the gover=ment and the 
Brotherhood. Three big cities on the Suez Canal, Egypt's pr=me strategic asset, are in a state of defiant, if largely 
peaceful, insurrection. Radical Islamists and seculari=ts accuse each other of forming armed militias, an ominous 
development. 
The country is send=ng Mr Morsi a loud message about the need for political inclusiveness. The=question is whether Mr 
Morsi and the Brothers are listening.
