Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
the 50% Trigger Date, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of at least two-thirds of all of the 
outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; 
from and after the 50% Trigger Date, the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board will be limited; 
from and after the 50% Trigger Date, stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and actions by 
our stockholders by written consent will be prohibited; 
from and after such date that Albertsons Investor, Kimco, Management Holdco and their respective Affiliates (or any person who 
is an express assignee or designee of Albertsons Investor, Kimco or Management Holdco's respective rights under our 
certificate of incorporation (and such assignee's or designee's Affiliates)) ceases to own, in the aggregate, at least 35% of the 
then-outstanding shares of our common stock (the "35% Trigger Date"), advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors will be established; 
limits on who may call stockholder meetings; 
requirements on any stockholder (or group of stockholders acting in concert), other than, prior to the 35% Trigger Date, the 
Designated Controlling Stockholder, who seeks to transact business at a meeting or nominate directors for election to submit a 
list of derivative interests in any of our company's securities, including any short interests and synthetic equity interests held by 
such proposing stockholder; 
requirements on any stockholder (or group of stockholders acting in concert) who seeks to nominate directors for election to 
submit a list of "related party transactions" with the proposed nominee(s) (as if such nominating person were a registrant 
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K, and the proposed nominee was an executive officer or director of the "registrant"); and 
our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a 
"poison pill" that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquiror, effectively preventing acquisitions that 
have not been approved by our board of directors. 
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred 
stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by our board of directors at the time of issuance or 
fixed by resolution without further action by the stockholders. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and 
liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of preferred stock could diminish the rights of 
holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of our common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to holders of 
preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of our board of directors to 
issue preferred stock could delay, discourage, prevent, or make it more difficult or costly to acquire or effect a change in control, thereby 
preserving the current stockholders' control. 
In addition, under the credit agreements governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (and, if we consummate the Anticipated 
Refinancing, under the credit agreements governing our New Credit Facilities), a change in control may lead the lenders to exercise 
remedies such as acceleration of the loan, termination of their obligations to fund additional advances and collection against the 
collateral securing such loans. Also, under the indentures governing the CoC Notes. a change of control may require us to offer to 
repurchase all of the CoC Notes for cash at a premium to the principal amount of the CoC Notes.
