S-I/A 
realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase shares of our common stock. 
Additional stock issuances could result in significant dilution to our stockholders. 
We may issue additional equity securities to raise capital, make acquisitions, or for a variety of other purposes. Additional 
issuances of our stock may be made pursuant to the exercise or conversion of new or existing convertible debt securities, warrants, 
stock options, or other equity incentive awards to new and existing service providers. Any such issuances will result in dilution to 
existing holders of our stock. We rely on equity-based compensation as an important tool in recruiting and retaining employees. The 
amount of dilution due to equity-based compensation of our employees and other additional issuances could be substantial. 
As an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, we will utilize certain modified disclosure 
requirements, and we cannot be certain whether these reduced requirements will make our Class A common stock less 
attractive to investors. 
We are an emerging growth company, and for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose 
to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to "emerging 
growth companies." These exemptions include reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic 
reports and proxy statements, an exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm audit our 
intemal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements to 
hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and to provide stockholders the opportunity to vote on any golden 
parachute payments not previously approved. We have in this prospectus utilized, and we plan in future filings with the SEC to 
continue to utilize, the modified disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result, our stockholders may 
not have access to certain information they may deem important. 
Under the JOBS Act, we will remain an "emerging growth company" until the earliest of 0) the last day of the first fiscal year 
in which our total annual revenue reaches or exceeds S1.0 billion; (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as 
defined in the Exchange Act, which could occur as early as January 1, 2017; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 
51.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the preceding three-year period; or (v) the last day of the first fiscal year 
following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering.
