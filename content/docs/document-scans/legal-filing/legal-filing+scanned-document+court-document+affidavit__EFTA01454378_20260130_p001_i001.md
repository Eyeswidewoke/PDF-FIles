If amounts are payable on a PPVA upon death, the value of the PPVA is generally 
included in the decedent's gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes.; ' There is no fair 
market value basis step-up in the PPVA as of the date of death, in contrast to the treatment of 
other assets.32 Under section 691(c) of the Code, a deduction with respect to IRD is permitted 
for the allocable portion of estate taxes resulting from the inclusion of the PPVA in the 
annuitant's estate. 
a. Estate Tax Deduction if Tax-Exempt Charity is Beneficiary 
For U.S. federal estate tax purposes, the estate may offset the inclusion of the 
PPVA in the estate for estate tax purposes if the beneficiary of the PPVA is a tax-exempt charity. 
Generally, for purposes of the U.S. federal estate tax, under section 2055 of the Code the value 
of the taxable estate is determined by deducting from the gross estate the amount all bequests, 
legacies, devises, or transfers to public, charitable and religious uses. The IRS has issued 
private letter rulings holding that the transfers of annuities to a tax-exempt charity by an estate 
resulted in such a deduction 33

areas of U.S. federal taxation. This opinion is based on the Code, applicable Treasury 
regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions, each as in effect as of the date of

matters described above. If any of the assumptions or representation is incorrect, incomplete,

jeopardized. This opinion represents our legal judgment but is not binding on the IRS or any
