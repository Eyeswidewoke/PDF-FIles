matter reserved to the sound discretion of the trial court." See, Feddersen v. Feddersen, 
68 F. Supp. 2d 585, 41 V.I. 230 (D.V.I. 1999). See also, MacAleer v. MacAleer, 1999 PA 
Super 35, 725 A.2d 829, 831 (1999). Once these distinctions have been made, the trial 
judge has broad equitable powers in disposing of marital property. Fuentes, 38 V.I. at 35, 
1997 WL 889532, at '5. 
[5] IHN41Although not specifically defined, marital property [e23] has been construed to 
encompass any property which the couple acquired during the marriage and which is 
subject to equitable distribution upon divorce. See Fuentes v. Fuentes, 247 F.Supp.2d 714 
(2003). See, Felix v. Felix, 1998 WL 458499, *2 (D.V.I. 1998). Compare, 16 V.I.C. 68 
(defining what constitutes 'separate property of a spouse, not subject to distribution).

[6] IHN51Considering the tremendous statutory examples and case law from other 
jurisdictions holding pension funds as marital property, the Virgin Islands has determined 
that a pension fund is also marital personal property, subject to claim by the other spouse 
upon divorce. Fuentes, 38 V.I. at 40, 1997 WL 889532, at *8. The Fuentes Court goes on 
to rationalize its decision by quoting the Rhode Island Supreme Court in Stevenson v. 
Stevenson, 511 A.2d 961, 965 (R.I. 1986): 
To the extent earned during the marriage. the (pension) benefits represent compensation for marital effort and are 
substitutes for current earnings which would have increased 
the marital standard of living or would have been 
converted into other assets divisible at dissolution. Subjecting the benefits to division is just. because in most cases the 
retirement benefits constitute the most valuable asset the potpie has acquired and they both have relied upon their 
pension payments for ["28] security in their older years. Nej Family Lew and Practice. § 37.07111 at 37-81 (1985). 
Fuentes v. Fuentes, 38 V.I. 29, 1997 WL 889532 (Tern. V.I. 1997). The evidence shows 
that Mr. Francis has approximately Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) in his 
retirement account. While, Dr. Wright-Francis has an amount that exceeds Five Hundred 
Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00), the exact amount is unknown. 
According to the Court in Fuentes, both parties are entitled to an equitable share of the 
other's retirement account. The Fuentes Court further explains that there are two (2) 
different methods used to determine the percentage which spouses are entitled. The first 
method presumes a present value on the retirement plan based on the expected lifespan 
of the employee-spouse. Weir v. Weir, 173 N.J. Super. 130, 413 A.2d 638 (1980). This 
method requires the Court to determine values contingent on life expectancy and 
employee-spouse's share of the retirement pay. Fuentes, 38 V.I. at 41, 1997 WL 889532, 
at *7. The second method calculates the percentage that the non-employee is entitled to, 
based on length of employment and marriage. They receive benefits when they become 
available under the plan. Id. Both methods require basic knowledge of the retirement plans 
that includes, but are not limited to the following information: 1) present value; 2) account 
history; [e25] 3) retirement plan regulations; and 4) the distribution schedule. 
With regard to the retirement accounts, the parties have simply failed to submit sufficient 
information for the Court to make a determination. Mr. Francis' submission only 
demonstrates the balance of his Fidelity IRA account when the parties dissolved their 
marriage in 2012. The Court has no reliable evidence from Dr. Wright-Francis regarding 
her retirement fund other than her vague testimony. Neither party has made sufficient
