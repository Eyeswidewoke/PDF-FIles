785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
capricious." United States v. Mason, 52 F.3d 1286, 1289 (4th Cir. 1995). We act only when 
the decision could not "have been reached by a reasonable jurist," or when we may call it 
"fundamentally wrong," "clearly unreasonable, arbitrary, or fanciful." Bluestein v. Cent. Wis. 
Anesthesiology, S.C., 769 F.3d 944, 957 (7th Cir. 2014); accord Am. Copper & Brass, Inc. 
v. Lake City Indus. Prods., Inc., 757 F.3d 540, 543 (6th Cir. 2014) (characterizing review of 
a class certification decision as "very ["84] limited"). 
Of course, deference does not equal blind acceptance. If, for instance, the district court 
entirely fails to undertake some part of the requisite analysis, then it may be appropriate to 
reverse. See, e.g., EQT Prod., 764 F.3d at 371 (vacating and remanding a certification 
order where the district court failed to conduct an appropriately rigorous analysis of Rule 
23's requirements). But when our review ventures into intensely factual matters or areas of 
practical concern, then our deference must be at its greatest — indeed, we ['929] must 
stand aside in those circumstances unless the lower court was "clearly wrong." Windham, 
565 F.2d at 65; accord CGC Holding Co., LLC v. Hutchens, 773 F.3d 1076, 1086 (10th Cir. 
2014) ("[A]s long as the district court applies the proper Rule 23 standard, we will defer to 
its class certification ruling provided that decision falls within the bounds of rationally 
available choices given the facts and law involved in the matter at hand."). 
We do not then reverse anytime we disagree with the result that the district court reaches. 
See First Penn-Pac. Life Ins. Co. v. Evans, 304 F.3d 345, 348 (4th Cir. 2002). Rather, "the 
[abuse-of-discretion] standard draws a line . . . between the unsupportable and the merely 
mistaken, between the legal error, disorder of reason, severe lapse of judgment, and 
procedural failure that a reviewing court may always correct, and [ *85] the simple 
disagreement that, on this standard, it may not." Evans v. Eaton Corp. Long Term 
Disability Plan, 514 F.3d 315, 322 (4th Cir. 2008); see also Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx 
Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S. Ct. 2447, 110 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1990) (holding that the 
district court did not abuse its discretion where it "applied the correct legal standard and 
offered substantial justification for its finding"). 
These principles might strike some as truisms, but they carry special force in the class-
certification context. "Granting or denying class certification is a highly fact-intensive matter 
of practicality," Monreal v. Potter, 367 F.3d 1224, 1238 (10th Cir. 2004), so much so that 
Ihrighly fact-based, complex, difficult matters" arise as a matter of routine, Amchem, 521 
U.S. at 630 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Unsurprisingly, then, we 
give district courts "broad discretion in deciding whether to allow the maintenance of a 
class action." Roman v. ESB, Inc., 550 F.2d 1343, 1348 (4th Cir. 1976); see also Lowery v. 
Circuit City Stores, Inc., 158 F.3d 742, 757-58 (4th Cir. 1998), vacated 527 U.S. 1031, 119 
S. Ct. 2388, 144 L. Ed. 2d 790 (1999), reaffd in relevant part, 206 F.3d 431 (4th Cir. 
2000). As with any other decision that appellate courts review for abuse of discretion, we 
should affirm a certification decision even if we are convinced that "reasons clearly existed 
for taking the other course." Lewis v. Bloomsburg Mills, Inc., 773 F.2d 561, 564 (4th Cir. 
1985); accord Simmons v. Poe, 47 F.3d 1370, 1382 (4th Cir. 1995).

An appellate court must be even more careful in reviewing any factual findings underlying 
the district court's decision, as we review those only for clear error. Thom, 445 F.3d at
