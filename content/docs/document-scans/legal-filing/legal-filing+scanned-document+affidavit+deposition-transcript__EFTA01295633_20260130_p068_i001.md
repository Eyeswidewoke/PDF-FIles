785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
These different decisionmakers then applied different standards. In the beam mill, for 
example, the process centered upon interviews alone. In contrast, the melt shop looked to 
applicants' work history, safety record, psychological interview, job skills, training, 
attendance, and scores on a job-specific aptitude test. Nucor's general manager quite 
reasonably described the promotions processes when he said that "each department ha[d] 
their own way of doing [promotions]." J.A. 1723. 
Plaintiffs' own expert found that each department had its own procedures, and at least 
eight different criteria — not including "numerous other idiosyncratic factors" -- might or 
might not be considered in making any employment decision. J.A. 1518-19. "Different 
supervisors," he explained, "utilized different criteria weighting schemes with little 
consistency among the selection officials and among the different hiring/promotion/transfer 
opportunities." J.A. 1525. Taking all this dissimilarity together, the expert concluded that 
Nucor's selection process was only "consistent ("1241 in its inconsistency." J.A. 1519. 
Yet Plaintiffs' statistical evidence incorrectly assumed the exact opposite: perfect, plant-
wide consistency as to promotions. Given that promotions decisions were made at the 
department or supervisor level using different and independent criteria, we cannot rightfully 
assume that a plant-wide disparity resulted from a uniform problem arising in the same 
way in each Nucor department. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2555. Put differently, the 
district court reasonably found that the "locus of autonomy" rested at the departmental 
level, not a plant-wide one. We cannot then assume that department decisions were made 
in lockstep, such that plant-wide disparities necessarily reflect common, departmental 
ones. See Bolden v. Walsh Constr. Co., 688 F.3d 893, 896 (7th Cir. 2012) (rejecting 
aggregate data because it did not necessarily imply that "all 25 superintendents behaved 
similarly, so it would not demonstrate commonality"). 
We have already seen these concepts play out in another employment discrimination 
action involving a similar Nucor facility. Applying Wal-Mart, the Eighth Circuit rejected 
statistics — from the same expert -- that reflected plant-wide disparities in promotions at an 
Arkansas Nucor plant. Bennett, 656 F.3d at 815-16. Just as in this case, the statistical 
[1'125] evidence there indicated that different departments in the plant applied different 
criteria for promotions decisions. Id. at 815. The plant-wide evidence therefore "ha[d] little 
p945] value in the commonality analysis" because it "did not differentiate between the 
hiring and promotion decisions made in each department." Id. The Eighth Circuit found 
that, in those sorts of circumstances, "a bottom-line analysis [wa]s insufficient to 
demonstrate that any disparate treatment or disparate impact present in one department 
was also common to all others." Id. at 815-16. 
As in Bennett, Nucor here provided its own analysis that demonstrated how the statistical 
disparities varied among the different departments in the plant. Nucor's expert measured 
how selection rates varied between white and black applicants on a department-by-
department basis over the period for which bidding information was available. With proper 
controls applied, the expert found that race differences between departments could vary by 
as much as 2.44 standard deviations. J.A. 5894. In other words, some departments 
experienced decidedly smaller disparities in selection rates, undermining any inference of 
uniformity and commonality among all departments.
