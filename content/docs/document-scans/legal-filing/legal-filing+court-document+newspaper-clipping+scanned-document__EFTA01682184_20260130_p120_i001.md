Sources tell Page Six that Epstein's high-
POwered lawyers - including Alan Dershowitz. 
Gerald Lefcourt. Roy Black and Kenneth 
Starr - have been negotiating a deal with federal prosecutors who are 
probing. among other things. whether the gray-haired money 
manager paid West Palm Beach girls for sex or transported them 
across state lines Epstein is currently charged by the State of Florida 
with soliciting young prostitutes for sex - but federal charges would be 
far more serious. 
The Palm Beach Post reported yesterday that Epstein is very close to 
a deal with the feds that would send him to jail for 11/2  to 2 years. 
Sources tell us that while a deal has not yet solidified. what's under 
discusson is a guilty plea to at least one charge in exchange fcr a 
sentence of 15 months in a Florida state prison, followed by 15 
months of home confinement That would be a fraction of the time he 
would have to seve if he were to be convicted by a jury. 
Epstein's Spokesman. Howard Rubenstein. said his client would 
have no comment. Dershowitz also declined to comment late 
yesterday. 
Palm Beach police records show that on March 15. 2C05. a 14-year-
old girl alleged she had visited Epstein s estate, where she Wally 
stripped and gave him a massage Curing which he "pulled out a 
purple vibrator" and used it on her in exchange for 5300. A further 
probe uncovered five young women who said Epstein had 
masturbated and touch 
during massages the records 
state. A woman named 
- who described herself as 
"like a Heidi Fleiss" - la era mi a 
nngng six girls between the 
ages of 14 and 16 to Epsteiris house, according to cops. 
Despite the allegations, Epstein was only nailed on a single charge of 
soliciting a hooker - but it sparked a federal probe. Epstein's lawyers 
and friends have inssted he was the ha less victim of a vendetta by 
Palm Beach Police Chief 
whom they described as a 
"born-again nutcase"
