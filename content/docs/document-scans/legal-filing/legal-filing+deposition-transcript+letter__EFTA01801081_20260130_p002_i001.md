possible after the crisis to rebuild political and regulatory confidence in the kind of financial markets busin=sses he 
dedicated his career to building and the people who run and profit=from them. 
Bob Diamond's resignation as Chief Executive of Barclays bank clearly=marks a turning point in the politics of banking in 
the UK. The announceme=t that Barclay's was to be fined E290mn as part of a settlement with the FSA financial 
regulator over its part in =he fixing of the London interbank lending rate between 2005 and 2008 prove= the tipping 
point for Mr Diamond. The Barclay's CEO has long been the m=st controversial of Britain's bank leaders and had few 
political friends. Yet in the end, the trigger for his=resignation was not direct political pressure, but the FSA's intimation 
=o the Barclay's board that unattributed threats from the top of Barclays=to the Bank of England had made Barclays' 
relationship with its regulator potentially toxic. 
Mr Diamond's departure and the LIBOR-fixing scandal will mark the start=of a new phase in the politics of the banking 
crisis in Britain. The sugge=tion that traders at Barclays and other banks were manipulating what is ultimately a key 
public benchmark fo= pricing financial products compounds a run of mis-selling and tax plannin= controversies. With a 
Parliamentary enquiry now to take place on the LIBO= issue in the UK, and the issue likely to ripple across other 
jurisdictions and produce both litigation an= possible prosecutions, banks in the UK are confronted with new levels of 
=olitical and public disdain. The fact that the Bank of England's own con=uct remains subject to question in some aspects 
of the LIBOR scandal will not deflect from this. 
It is safe to assume that the setting of LIBOR will now be moved into t=e remit of the UK financial regulator. Brussels will 
tighten market abuse rules to apply criminal sanctions to tampering with indices like LIBOR. But the most significant 
political a=d regulatory outcome from these events will be to renew the debate about u=iversal banking. Where this 
debate has to this point focused on scale, imp=icit subsidy and systemic risk, it will now focus on culture, personal 
character and contamination from the values of the trading floor to the rest of a ranking institution. Because these 
things cannot be regulated, the probability is that politicians will=focus on their political proxies, especially pay. 
The return of Vic=ers 
The link between what has happened at Barclays and the universal banking argument is trust. Preserving the universal 
bank model reli=s on public trust that the core retail functions of a bank and its trading=activities can be properly and 
completely segregated. The UK Independent Commission on Banking chaired by Sir John V=ckers proposed in 2011 that 
they could be preserved in a single institutio= but in separate entities, with the retail functions ringfenced with 
their=own higher capital levels. The Vickers Commission recommended that all derivatives services should be kep= 
outside this ringfence. 
The UK government accepted the argument that retail banks=should be able to maintain some simple derivatives 
functions such as produ=ts for hedging currency risk for business clients. The Barclays experience=is already leading 
politicians and commentators in the UK to argue that simple derivatives may be an oxymoron= Trying to define them 
may be a futile exercise, and one that will inevita=ly be gamed by banks. 
The UK government shows some reluctance to revisit its in=erpretation of the Vickers proposals. But if the British 
Parliamentary enq=iry into the LIBOR issue now concludes that the government has erred on th= side of trusting banks,
