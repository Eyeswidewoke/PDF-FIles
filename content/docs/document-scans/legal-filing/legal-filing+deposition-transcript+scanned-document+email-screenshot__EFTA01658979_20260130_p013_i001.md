stowaways were from or what their intentions were." British police said, "They had made verbal 
threats towards the crew. No one has been reported injured." 
Afghanistan Claims Top Al-Qaida Propagandist Wanted By FBI Was Killed. 
The AP (10/25) reports, "Afghanistan claimed Sunday it killed a top al-Qaida propagandist," 
Husam Abd al-Rauf, also known as Abu Muhsin al-Masri, "on an FBI most-wanted list during an 
operation in the country's east." The move, as well as ongoing violence, "threaten the face-to-
face peace talks and risk plunging this nation beset by decades of war into further instability." 
Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security "claimed on Twitter to have killed him in Ghazni 
province," then "released a photograph late Sunday afternoon it described as al-Rauf's corpse, 
which resembled FBI images of the militant leader." According to "Wahidullah Jumazada, a 
spokesman for the provincial governor in Ghazni...Afghan forces killed six suspected militants in 
the raid, without acknowledging al-Rauf had been killed." 
Reuters (10/24, Shalizi) reports that NCTC Director Chris Miller "confirmed al-Masri's 
death in a statement, saying his'removal .. from the battlefield is a major setback to a terrorist 
organization that is consistently experiencing strategic losses facilitated by the United States 
and its partners." Miller added the loss "highlights the diminishing effectiveness of the terrorist 
organization." 
Bloomberg (10/24, Najafizada, 4.73M) reports, "The U.S. issued a federal arrest warrant 
in 2018 after he was charged with conspiracy to kill American nationals and providing material 
support and resources to foreign terrorist organizations," according to the FBI website. 
The Hill (10/25, Coleman, 2.98M) reports that an Afghan presidential palace statement 
said the death "proved that the threat of terrorism and the Taliban's links to terrorist networks 
are still in place." The statement added, "The Taliban should prove to the people, the 
government of Afghanistan and the international community that they are ending their links 
with terrorist groups, including al-Qaida." The palace is urging those groups to "stop the war 
and violence and facilitate a dignified and sustainable peace in the country." 
Guantanamo Bay Not Closing Despite Lack Of Population Growth Under Trump. 
The Hill (10/25, Kheel, 2.98M) reports that Guantanamo Bay's "population has not grown" 
under President Trump, whose Administration "recently celebrated bringing two of the most 
notorious alleged ISIS fighters to the United States for trial." The detention center "has all but 
disappeared from either party's talk on the campaign trail as the facility nears 20 years of 
operations," and remains open. The Administration has, however, brought "27 Americans 
captured by the SDF back to the United States for prosecution," the DOJ announced this month. 
Amnesty International's Daphne Eviatar said her group will "definitely try to push a new 
administration on this." She added the US is "coming on the 20th anniversary of the prison, and 
I think that people might remember, `Oh my god, this prison is still open. People are still being 
held indefinitely without charge or trial. This is crazy." 
Bloomberg Analysis: French Interior Minister Now "Public Face Of A Crackdown 
Whipping Up Sentiment Against The Broader Muslim Community." 
A Bloomberg (10/24, Nussbaum, 4.73M) analysis says that French Interior Minister Gerald 
Darmanin "has vowed to root out extremists after a grisly murder in Paris. In saying he wants 
to preserve a distinctly French way of life, he risks the perception he's targeting not just 
Islamists, but all Muslims." Bloomberg adds that Darmanin's "vision for the country includes 
fewer halal butchers, ethnic clothing stores and even specialist supermarket aisles." While 
speaking with French television on Tuesday, he said, "It always shocked me to enter a 
supermarket and see a shelf devoted to the food of one community, and to another one next to 
it." He also said, "Some people need to understand that winning market share by appealing to 
basic instincts doesn't necessarily contribute to the common good." According to Bloomberg,
