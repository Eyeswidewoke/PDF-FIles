this offering. To the extent that the underwriters create a naked short position, they will purchase shares in the open market to cover the position. 
The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M of the Securities Act, they may also engage in other activities that stabilize, maintain or 
otherwise affect the price of the common stock, including the imposition of penalty bids. This means that if the representative of the underwriters purchases 
common stock in the open market in stabilizing transactions or to cover short sales, the representative can require the underwriters that sold those shares as 
part of this offering to repay the underwriting discount received by them. 
These activities may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of 
the common stock, and, as a result, the price of the common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If the 
underwriters commence these activities, they may discontinue them at any time. The underwriters may carry out these transactions on the NASDAQ Global 
Select Market, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. 
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiations between us and 
the representative of the underwriters. In determining the initial public offering price. we and the representative of the underwriters expect to consider a 
number of factors including: 
the information set forth in this prospectus and otherwise available to the representative; 
our prospects and the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete; 
an assessment of our management; 
our prospects for future earnings; 
the general condition of the securities markets at the time of this offering: 
the recent market prices of, and demand for, publicly traded common stock of generally comparable companies; and 
other factors deemed relevant by the underwriters and us. 
Neither we nor the underwriters can assure investors that an active trading market will develop for our common stock, or that the shares will trade in the 
public market at or above the initial public offering price.
Directed share program 
At our request. the underwriters have reserved for sale, at the initial public offering price, up to 5% of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus 
for sale to our employees and directors and those of IAC. These sales will be made by an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, an underwriter of this 
offering, through a directed share program. If these persons purchase reserved shares it will reduce the number of shares of common Mock available for sale 
to the general public. Any reserved shares that are not so purchased will be offered by the underwriters to the general public on the same terms as the other 
shares of common stock offered by this prospectus.
