apprehended." When aliens formally request asylum, they are sent to the nearest 
USCIS authorized fingerprint site. They have all 10 fingers scanned and are subject

Safe Third Country Agreement with Canada. On August 30, 2002, 
Canada and the United States signed the final draft text for the "safe third country" 
agreement regarding asylum claims made at land border ports of entry. The 
agreement states that any person being removed from Canada in transit through the 
United States, who makes an asylum claim in the United States, will be returned to 
Canada to have the claim re-examined by Canada. Further, any person being 
removed from the United States in transit through Canada, who makes an asylum 
claim in Canada, and whose asylum claim has been rejected by the United States, will 
be returned to the country from which the person is being removed. If the person has 
not had a refugee status or asylum claim determined by the United States, he or she 
will be returned to the United States to have the claim examined by the United States.

where there are "substantial grounds" for believing that he or she would be in danger 
of being tortured. The alien must meet the three elements necessary to establish 
torture: (1 ) the torture must involve the infliction of severe pain or suffering, either 
physical or mental; (2) the torture must be intentionally inflicted; and (3) the torture 
must be committed by or at the acquiescence of a public official or person acting in 
an official capacity. Generally, an applicant for non-removal under Article 3 has the
