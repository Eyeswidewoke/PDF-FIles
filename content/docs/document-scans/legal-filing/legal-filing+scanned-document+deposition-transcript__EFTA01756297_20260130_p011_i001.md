three U=E islands by the Shah -- in recognition of shared economic interests and t=e substantial Iranian expatriate 
populations that reside in many of the mo=archies. 
All that is now ancient history in states like Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and t=e UAE. Saudi officials have taken a particularly 
aggressive stance. Accord=ng to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable from 2008, the Saudi king has "repe=tedly exhorted the 
United States to cut off the head of the snake" -- Ir=n's nuclear weapons program. Another cable from the same year 
quoted a v=teran Saudi minister for foreign affairs suggesting a U.S. or NATO offensi=e in southern Lebanon to end Iran-
backed Hezbollah's grip on power there= And a former Saudi intelligence chief has said publicly that Saudi 
Arabia=should "consider acquiring nuclear weapons to counter Iran." 
In early 2011, Bahrain's rulers took full advantage of anti-Iranian senti=ents to act against domestic opponents, 
announcing that they would deport =11 Shia residents who had "links to Hezbollah and Iran's Revolutionary=Guard." In 
practice, that meant expelling hundreds of Bahrain's Lebanese=residents, suspending all flights between the capital 
Manama and Beirut, a=d warning Bahraini nationals not to travel to Lebanon due to "threats an= interference by 
terrorists." 
Abu Dhabi's attitude toward Iran originally appeared to have been more he=itant, perhaps because of its previous 
ruler's more moderate policies. A=cording to a 2006 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, the UAE govern=ent told 
U.S. officials that "the threat from al-Qaeda would be minor co=pared to if Iran had nukes...but that it was reluctant to 
take any action =hat might provoke its neighbor." Nevertheless, as Abu Dhabi's forceful=Crown Prince Muhammad bin 
Zayed al-Nahyan and his five full brothers gaine= control over most of the country's foreign policy, the emirate's view= 
have fallen in line with those of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Since 2007, t=e crown prince's circle has pushed Western 
officials to put more troops =n the region to counter Iranian hegemony. In 2009, the crown prince forcef=lly warned the 
United States of appeasing Iran [31, reportedly saying that="Ahmadinejad is Hitler." 
Qatar, which has sought a role as regional peace broker, has been more care=ul with its public statements on Iran. Even 
so, in a private meeting in 20=9, Qatar's then prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Than=, characterized 
Qatar's relationship with Iran as one in which "they I=e to us and we lie to them." Qatar's calculated diplomacy perhaps 
owes=to its precarious balancing act: the country hosts major U.S. military fac=lities while sharing its largest gas 
resource -- the offshore North Field =- with Iran. 
THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY 
Perhaps even riskier than their hawkishness toward Iran is the Gulf monarch=es' dovishness toward Israel. Since 
independence, the Gulf monarchies ha=e upheld laws requiring government personnel, businesses, and even individ=al 
residents to boycott Israel. In the UAE, the federal government has alw=ys housed an Israel boycott office. One federal 
law, passed in 1971, stipu=ates that "any natural or legal person shall be prohibited from directly=or indirectly 
concluding an agreement with organizations or persons either=resident in Israel, connected therewith by virtue of their 
nationality of =orking on its behalf." 
For many years, however, the boycott extended well beyond such restrictions= The state-owned telecommunications 
company has barred telephone calls to =srael and blocked Web sites with an Israeli suffix. The government has 
not=permitted Israeli nationals to enter the UAE, nor -- in theory -- any visi=ors that possess Israeli visa stamps in their 
passports. Yet trade opportu=ities have occasionally prompted the UAE to ignore its own boycott. After =oining the 
World Trade Organization in 1996, UAE authorities were clearly =nder pressure to drop or at least relax their stance. 
When Dubai agreed to=host the WTO's annual meeting in 2003, delegations from all of the organiz=tion's member 
states had to be invited; there was no way to prevent the ar=ival of an Israeli delegation or the flying of an Israeli flag on 
top of t=e Dubai World Trade Centre tower. 
Concerns over Iran have further thawed relations between some of the Gulf m=narchies and Israel. An open channel of 
communication now exists between Q=tar and the Israeli security services. In late 2010, Qatar hosted a large =elegation 
of senior Israeli policemen, among them the head of the Israeli =olice's investigations and intelligence branch, ostensibly 
as part of an=Interpol meeting. Thus far, there is little firm evidence of growing secur=ty ties between Saudi Arabia and 
Israel, or at least there have been no bl=tant admissions of them (as has been the case with Bahrain and Qatar). 
Nev=rtheless, rumors of significant Saudi-Israeli cooperation, prompted by the=existence of a mutual enemy, have 
circulated in diplomatic circles for yea=s. 
The monarchies' new policies toward Israel are particularly dangerous giv=n domestic political realities. The Gulf's 
national populations are, for=the most part, anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian. Gulf nationals grew up wa=ching the 
Palestinian intifada on television, and the liberation of Palest=ne remains a shared ideal among the region's youth. There
