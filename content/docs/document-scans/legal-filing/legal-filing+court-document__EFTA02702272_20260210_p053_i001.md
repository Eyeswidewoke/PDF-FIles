By reason of such subordination, in the event of our liquidation or insolvency, holders of Senior 
Indebtedness and holders of other obligations of ours that are not subordinated to Senior Indebtedness may 
recover more, ratably, than the holders of subordinated debt securities. 
Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the rights of the holders of subordinated debt 
securities will be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or 
distributions of cash, property or securities of ours applicable to such Senior Indebtedness until the principal of, 
any premium and interest on, and any additional amounts with respect to. subordinated debt securities have been 
paid in full. (Section 16.4 of the subordinated indentures)

such default has ended and such default has not been cured or waived or ceased to exist; or

indebtedness as to which, by the terms of the instrument creating or evidencing the same, it is provided 
that such Indebtedness is subordinated to or ranks equally with the subordinated debt securities:

Indebtedness of ours to an Affiliate of ours; 
• 
interest accruing after the filing of a petition initiating any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar 
proceeding unless such interest is an allowed claim enforceable against us in a proceeding under 
federal or state bankruptcy laws;

trade accounts payable; and

any Indebtedness, including all other debt securities and guarantees in respect of those debt securities, 
initially issued to (I) W. R. Berkley Capital Trust III, or (2) any trust, partnership or other entity 
affiliated with us which is a financing vehicle of ours or any Affiliate of ours in connection with an 
issuance by such entity of preferred securities or other securities which are similar to the preferred 
securities described under "Description of Preferred Securities" below. 
Such Senior Indebtedness will continue to be Senior Indebtedness and be entitled to the benefits of the 
subordination provisions irrespective of any amendment. modification or waiver of any term of such Senior 
Indebtedness. (Sections 1.1 and 16.8 of the subordinated indentures) 
The subordinated indentures provide that the foregoing subordination provisions, insofar as they relate to 
any particular issue of subordinated debt securities, may be changed prior to such issuance. Any such change 
would be described in the related prospectus supplement.
