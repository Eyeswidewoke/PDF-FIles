Violent crime in Milwaukee has been on the rise in recent years, with the number of reported incidents rising from 1,045 
per 100,000 residents in 2010 to 1,364=per 100,000 residents in 2013. However, an increase in the number of reported 
crimes may not mean that Milwaukee has gotten more dangerous. A 2012 report=by the Journal Sentinel, a local 
Wisconsin newspaper, found that police in Milwaukee had misreported thousands of crimes in prior years, which led to 
lower crime rates. Further, while Milwaukee reported a large number of viol=nt crimes, its property crime rate was 
comparatively low, ranking just 83rd am=ng cities with at least 100,000 residents.

dangero=s cities, but still close to three times the national murder rate of 4.5 per 100,000 residents. Property crimes, 
too, were slightly less prevalent than =n other dangerous cities. There were just 248 motor vehicle thefts per 100,00= 
Rockford residents last year, slightly higher than the national rate, but exceptionally low compared to other large cities 
with high violent crime ra=es. Yet, arson was quite common, with 71 incidents per 100,000 in 2013, more th=n in all but 
four other cities.

4.5 murders per 100,000 people in the United States last year. In Baltimore= the murder rate was 37 per 100,000 
residents, higher than in all but four o=her large U.S. cities. Robberies were a major contributor to the area's=violent 
crime statistics, as 600 incidents were reported per 100,000 residents, ver=us a national robbery rate of less than 110 
per 100,000 residents last year.</=pan>
