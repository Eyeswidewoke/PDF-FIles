The Muslim Brotherhood's Long Game: Egypt's Ruling Party Plots Its Path to Power 
Eric Trager <http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/experts/view/trager-eric> 
July 6, 2012 -- In the 18 months since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, the Muslim Brotherhood has risen 
swiftly from the cave to the castle. It founded the now-dominant Freedom and Justice Party last April, won a massive 
plurality in the winter parliamentary elections, and, last week, celebrated as its candidate, Mohamed Morsi, won Egypt's 
presidential elections. After 84 years of using its nationwide social services networks to build an Islamic state in Egypt 
from the ground up, the Brotherhood is, for the first time, poised to shape Egyptian society from the top down. There is, 
however, a catch: most of the Brotherhood's gains exist in name only. In early June, a court order invalidated the 
parliamentary elections and dissolved the Brotherhood-dominated parliament. Then, just prior to the second round of 
the presidential elections, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) issued a constitutional declaration that 
seized executive authority from the presidency, ultimately rendering Morsi a mostly powerless figure. But after weeks 
of mounting tension with the SCAF, including mass demonstrations against the junta's power grab, the Brotherhood is 
dialing things down. It fears that agitating for more authority now could foment unrest and alienate a deeply divided 
public. It is also wary of what happened in Algeria in 1991, when the country's military-backed government responded 
to the electoral victory of an Islamist party with a harsh crackdown that culminated in civil war. To avoid further violence 
and cement its place in Egyptian politics, the Brotherhood now hopes to create a period of calm in the short run so that 
it can act more assertively in the future. To begin with, the Brotherhood is attempting to forge a unified front with 
Egypt's other political parties. It began these efforts a week before the announcement of Morsi's victory to dissuade the 
SCAF from rigging the elections for Mubarak-era candidate Ahmed Shafik. During two days of intense negotiations, 
Morsi met with a wide spectrum of political groups and activists, promising to name a woman and a Christian as vice 
presidents and to appoint a cabinet that would not be dominated by the Brotherhood. Brotherhood leaders have used 
this agreement to prove that they intend to build a representative government. "We are standing with all political 
powers for the same demands," Brotherhood parliamentarian Khaled Deeb told me. 
Yet this is not the first time that the Brotherhood has attempted to insulate itself by aligning with other factions, 
and history suggests that these agreements are typically short-lived. In June 2011, the Brotherhood joined the 
nationalist Wafd party in creating the Democratic Alliance for Egypt, an electoral coalition that at one point included 
approximately forty political parties ranging from socialist to Salafist. But by September, the Democratic Alliance broke 
down over the Brotherhood's insistence on reserving 40 percent of the coalition's candidacies for its own members, 
thereby leaving too few seats to satisfy its other partners, most of whom bolted. It hardly mattered: three months of 
unity enabled the Brotherhood to build its profile as a leading political entity, and it ultimately won a 47-percent 
plurality in the winter parliamentary elections. The Brotherhood's current unity project appears destined for the same 
fate. Despite initial reports that Brotherhood figures would fill only 30 percent of the new cabinet, Brotherhood 
parliamentary leader Farid Ismail recently said in Al-Ahram that the organization may take up to half. The Brotherhood 
also seems intent on controlling the cabinet selection process to ensure that many non-Brotherhood ministers are non-
