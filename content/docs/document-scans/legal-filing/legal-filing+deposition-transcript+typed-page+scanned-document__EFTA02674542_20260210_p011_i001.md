facing many American families have never made it onto the streets other tha= the Occupy Wall Street protests and Tea 
Party rallies, both allowing their believers to blow off steam. 
But really caught my initial interest was the article's title — The Urban Fire Next ti=e, as it cause me to reflect on James 
Baldwin's brilliant and provocative 1963 book =ndash; The Fire Next Time. The book consists of two essays, both 
examining the so called "Negro Problem" in America in=the early 1960's ("Negro" was the term then in use for Africa=-
American, and is used interchangeably with the term "black" in this book. &=bsp;The use of both terms in this analysis is 
therefore reflective of their usage in the book, and of the socio-cultural-literary context in which they were written). 
Themes o=her than "the Negro Problem" explored by the book include an examin=tion of the shallowness and 
ineffectiveness of religious faith, and of inter-genera=ional influences and relationships. I was so taken by this book that 
in my early 20s I sought out James Baldwin in Paris=and we became friends to his death in 1987.

This is a book that Mitt Romney should have read, because if he had he might have understood why his 47% comment 
was egregious and =n a sense racist, even though the 47% included whites, but it included them in a way that 
&l=quo;they are Niggers (Spics, Fags, Ragheads, Chinks, poor white trash) too=" Also every Republican should read, The 
Fire Next Time, including Latino Republicans, especially peo=le like Marco Rubio, who like myself try to walk the fine line 
between our ethnicity and the establishment, that tells us that our success is because we are different f=om our ethnic 
brothers and sisters. And if you really want to understand why Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev became radicalized, 
you too should read James Baldwin's The Fire=Next Time, and substitute the word =i style="color:rgb(24,24,24);font-
family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;Ii=e-height:115%">Negro with Muslim or Arab. =And to be honest, the same is true 
for our foreign policy, where the term American Exceptionalism is often used in condescension (much like the Silent 
Majority, =span style="line-height:18px">separating them from us), instead of a beacon of light for those who wan= to 
join. 
But getting back to Sharkey's article, The Urban Fire Next Time, he points out that the gut=ing of urban social programs 
that have kept minorities, the poor and the disaffected young coul= have grave consequences, and the bombing of the 
Boston Marathon and the Newtown massacre are the most recent examples —&=bsp; like the messages in The Fire Next 
Time=/b>, if heeded by the establishment might have reduced the angst that led to the 1960s urban riot=. How many 
more mass shootings and bombings do we have to endure before our political and business leaders realize, that d=luting 
the strength of the safety net that the elderly, poor, minorities and the y=ung rely on to survive and more importantly to 
feel part of the society? &=bsp; 
Compare the current conditions in urban America with those in the early 1980s, when the nation saw a less severe 
recession, yet neighborhoods were deteriorating and violent crime wa= much higher. Cities were trying to overcome a 
range of economic and d=mographic transformations: the loss of manufacturing jobs, the migration of whites an= 
middle-class minorities out of central city neighborhoods and declining tax revenues. Meanwhile, cities saw their 
federal aid decline rapidly as the Reagan administration slashed programs l=ke the Community Development Block 
Grant and public housing. And =he consequences were predictable. Housing agencies were unable to ma=ntain their 
complexes. Public schools crumbled, police forces were overwhelmed. Public transit deteriorated= It took two decades 
for many cities to recover. But the rich got richer at the cost of economic inequality mushrooming. 
Sharkey believes that one of the main difference between now and then is, $840 billion fiscal stimulus program in 2009, 
the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, because=many of the largest and most important investments made by 
the "stimulus&rdquo= went to institutions and organizations that were essential to functioning communiti=s. 
Abandoned homes did not become hot spots for crime because almost=$2 billion went to acquiring, renovating or 
demolishing them. As such, class siz=s did not swell and police officers did not disappear from city streets because 
stimulus money was use= to stabilize state budgets, improve under-performing schools and rehire office=s for 
community-oriented policing.
