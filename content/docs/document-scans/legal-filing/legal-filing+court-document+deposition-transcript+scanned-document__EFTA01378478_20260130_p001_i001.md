Buy the '17s; Rest of Curve Is Neither 
Steep Nor Low-priced Enough * 
Capex and apex cuts as well as domestic price increases are positive but not 
enough to significantly mitigate the large funding gap 
This week's announcement of capex and opex cuts for 2015 and 2016 and last 
week's domestic fuel price increases are positive news for Petrobras, but we 
remain concerned with the company's challenge to roll over USD60bn and 
USD104bn of debt maturities in the next four and nine years, respectively, and 
with the company's ability and motivation to subordinate bondholders. We are 
also not convinced that the company can stop its cash burn with oil below 
USD55/bbl and USDBRL above 3.8. Further domestic price increases beyond 
cost inflation might prove difficult to achieve without a significant 
improvement of Brazil's economy. We also see important challenges for the 
USD15bn divestment program targeted by the end of 2016. 
Revised guidance is poor on disclosure; divestments might prove challenging 
and not so irnpactful for deleveraging if majority stakes are sold 
Petrobras announced on Monday evening a reduction in the capex and opex 
excluding raw materials guidance for 2015 and 2016. The capex guidance was 
reduced by USD3bn and USD8bn, to USD25bn and USD19bn, in 2015 and 
2016, respectively, while the opex ex- raw materials was reduced by USDI bn 
and USD6bn, to USD29bn and USD21bn. The company also reiterated its 
USD15bn divestment plan by 2016 and kept its 2016 production guidance 
unchanged. The 30% capex reduction for 2016 was most likely above 
consensus -we were forecasting USD22bn for that year. The opex reduction is 
more difficult to reconcile with our estimates and general consensus due to the 
lack of disclosure on historical figures and whether the new guidance includes 
any non-recurring items or deconsolidation of assets (that would eventually be 
sold). We also have questions about future capex levels and the future 
production curve, in light of the announced capex reduction. Moreover, we see 
challenges to the USD15bn divestment plan in terms of valuation and timing 
and believe the company might have to sell majority stakes of non-core assets 
and/or sell pre-salt reserves at relatively low valuations. The latter could prove 
quite challenging to be approved by the government due to the risk of strong 
public and political opposition. It is also important to note that selling control 
of assets would reduce the company's EBITDA and thus mitigate their 
deleveraging impact, even if accretive to leverage (above 5x EV to EBITDA). 
Upgraciing the '1 is to Buy; the rest of the c:ur•.ve Is neither steep ',or 
ic,,c1 
enough 
We have revised our forecasts and strongly believe the company can meet its 
debt maturities through 2017 without resorting to direct support from the 
government. We thus upgrade Petrobras 3.25% and 3.5% '17s to Buy (from 
Hold) due to a still attractive yield of about 9.7%, in our view. We maintain our 
Hold recommendation on the other Petrobras bonds that we cover and initiate 
coverage of Petrobras 2115 bonds with a Hold recommendation. We are more 
comfortable with an yield of 9.7% for the '17s than with 10.0%-10.5% for the 
2018-2019 maturities, given the company's steep funding gap ramp and the 
risk of bondholder subordination, combined with relatively high bond prices 
and more dependence on the oil price and the USDBRL. While the maturities 
beyond 2019 offer lower bond prices (67 - 82), we don't think yields under 11%
