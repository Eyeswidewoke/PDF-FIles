subsequently becoming the house band for the Acid Tests he staged. The Dead were not 
inclined to fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or 
country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of 
these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, 
melding several of them. It was doubtless with this in mind that Bill Graham said of the Grateful 
Dead, "They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do." Often 
(both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes. 
Their live shows, fed by their improvisational approach to music, made the Grateful Dead 
different from most other touring bands. While most rock and roll bands rehearse a standard 
show for their tours that is replayed night after night, city after city, the Grateful Dead never did. 
As Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, "We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work 
off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper." They maintained this operating ethic 
throughout their existence. For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of 
a hundred or so songs. 
The 1969 live album Live/Dead did capture more of their essence, but commercial surnes did 
not come until Workingman's Dead and American Beauty, both released in 1970. These records 
largely featured the band's laid-back acoustic musicianship and more traditional song 
structures. 
As the band and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each 
member's stylistic contribution became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Lesh, who 
was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, 
did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but opted for more melodic, symphonic 
and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional 
rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at the upper end of the 
Dead's sound. The two drummers, Mickey Hart and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex 
interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside 
the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an ii-count measure to his drumming, bringing a new 
dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its emerging style. Garcia's 
lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his training in 
fingerpicking and banjo. 
The band's primary lyricists, Robert Hunter and John Perry Barlow, commonly used themes 
involving love and loss, life and death, gambling and murder, beauty and horror, chaos and 
order, God and other religious themes, travelling and touring, etc. Less frequent ideas include 
the environment and issues from the world of politics.[citation needed] 
Merchandising and representation 
Hal Kant was an entertainment industry attorney who specialized in representing musical 
groups. He spent 35 years as principal lawyer and general counsel for the Grateful Dead, a 
position in the group that was so strong that his business cards with the band identified his role 
as "Czar". 
Kant brought the band millions of dollars in revenue through his management of the band's 
intellectual property and merchandising rights. At Kant's recommendation, the group was one 
of the few rock 'n roll pioneers to retain ownership of their music masters and publishing rights.
