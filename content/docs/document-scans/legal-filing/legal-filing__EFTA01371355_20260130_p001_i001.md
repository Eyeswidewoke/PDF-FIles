The Parties selected Class Action Administration LLC ("CAA") as the Claims Administrator 
for this settlement. ECF No. 92-4 ¶ 1; ECF No. 107-1 ¶ 1. CAA located records for 186,031 
N14 Class members representing 80,224 N14 Class Vehicles. ECF No. 92-4 ¶ 4. Of these, 
185,582 records had mailing addresses, and 111,893 had email addresses. Id. 
CAA emailed notices of the settlement to addresses associated with 111,843 Class 
Vehicles on February 19, 2016 and 50 Class Vehicles on May 2, 2016. Id. 118. Delivery 
failed for 631 of these addresses, resulting in a success rate of over 94 percent. ECF No. 
107-1 ¶ 4. Before February ri2] 19, 2016, CAA also established a website, 
www.TimingChainTensionerSettlement.com , containing information about the settlement 
and blank copies of the claim form for N14 Class members, ECF No. 92-4 1110, and a toll-
free telephone number for Class members to seek information about the settlement. Id. ¶ 
12. Telephone operators took 3,992 calls from Class members and other individuals

claim forms to only 80,000 N14 Class members on February 19, 2016. ECF No. 92-4 ¶ 6.

notice packets on May 19, 2016, for a total of 185,582 notice packets mailed to Class
