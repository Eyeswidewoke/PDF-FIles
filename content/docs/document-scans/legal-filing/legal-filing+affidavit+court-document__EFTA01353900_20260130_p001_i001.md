GLDUSIB3 Dimension Capital Management 
Section 9: Certain Legal. ERISA and Tax Considerations 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV, LP 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
In connection with any acquisition or beneficial ownership by the Fund of more than 5% of any class of the equity 
securities of a company registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. as amended (the 'Exchange Act"), 
the Fund may be required to make certain filings with the SEC. Generally, these filings require disclosure of the identity 
and background of the purchaser, the source and amount of funds used to acquire the securities, the purpose of the 
transaction, the purchaser's interest in the securities, and any contracts, arrangements or undertakings regarding the 
securities. In certain circumstances. the Fund may be required to aggregate its investment position in a given portfolio 
company with the beneficial ownership of that company's securities by or on behalf of the General Partner or the 
Manager and their respective affiliates, which could require the Fund, together with such other parties, to make certain 
disclosure filings or otherwise restrict the Fund's activities with respect to such portfolio company securities. 
Also, if the Fund becomes the beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of the equity securities of a company 
registered under the Exchange Act or places a director on the board of directors of such a company, the Fund may be 
subject to certain additional reporting requirements and to liability for short-swing profits under Section 16 of the 
Exchange Act. The Fund intends to manage its investments so as to avoid the short-swing profit liability provisions of 
Section 16 of the Exchange Act. 
Investment Company Act of 1940 
It is anticipated that the Fund, being an entity organized outside the U.S. and not intending to make a public offering of its 
securities in the U.S., will not be required to register under the Investment Company Act. In order to ensure that the 
Fund will not be subject to the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act, the Fund will rely on the 
exemptions contained in the Investment Company Act, including but not limited to Section 3(c)(7) thereof. Section 
3(c)(7) excludes from the definition of investment company issuers whose outstanding securities are owned exclusively 
by 'qualified purchasers,' as defined under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(7) has been interpreted by the 
staff of the SEC in respect of a non-U.S. fund, such as the Fund, to require that only the U.S. Investors therein must be 
qualified purchasers. The Fund will obtain appropriate representations and undertakings from U.S. Investors to ensure 
that the conditions of these exemptions are met. 
Offers and sales of Interests will therefore only be offered (i) outside the U.S. to Investors other than U.S. persons (as 
defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) and U.S. residents in offshore transactions that meet the requirements 
of Regulation S under the Securities Act (an 'Eligible Non-U.S. Investor) or (ii) to Investors whose participation would 
not require the Fund to register as an investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act 
(an -Eligible U.S. Investor) (Eligible Non-U.S. Investors and Eligible U.S. Investors. together. "Eligible Investors"). 
Offers to purchase, and subsequent transfers of Interests, will be subject to certain restrictions, and an Investor's ability 
to resell its Interest may therefore be limited. Sales and transfers that would require the Fund to be registered as an 
investment company under the Investment Company Act will be void ab litho and will not be honored by the Manager. 
The Manager has the right at any time, at the expense and risk of the holder of an interest held by or on behalf of a U.S. 
person who is not an Eligible U.S. Investor at the time it purchases such Interest, to require the transfer of such Interests, 
in whole or in part, to an Eligible Investor in order to permit the Fund to avoid registration under the Investment Company 
Act. 
U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940 
The Manager is not registered as an investment adviser under the U.S. Advisers Act of 1940 (the 'Advisers Act"). The 
Manager expects that the U.S. Adviser will be a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act; how ever. under 
applicable guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC"), only certain provisions of the Advisers 
Act will apply to the Manager's and the U.S. Adviser's relationship with the Fund since the Fund is not expected to be a 
"United States person" (as such term is defined under the Advisers Act). Registration as an investment adviser under the 
Advisers Act by the U.S. Adviser does not imply any specific level of skill or training nor does it imply any endorsement. 
approval or certification of the U.S. Adviser by the SEC.
