Investors should in particular refer in this Memorandum to Section 25 of the General Section. The investment 
objectives are based on a number of assumptions which the Company believes reasonable, but there is no 
assurance that the investment objectives will be realised. 
The General Partner has taken all reasonable care to ensure that the information contained in this 
Memorandum is accurate as of the date of this Memorandum (or such other date as stated herein). Other than as 
described below, neither the General Partner, the Company, nor the initiators has any obligation to update this 
Memorandum. 
Under no circumstances should the delivery of this Memorandum, irrespective of when it is made, create an 
implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the Company since such date. The General Partner 
reserves the right to modify any of the terms of the offering and the Shares described herein. This 
Memorandum may be updated and amended by a supplement and where such supplement is prepared this 
Memorandum will be read and construed with such supplement. 
This Memorandum will be updated in accordance with Luxembourg Law. 
No person has been authorised to give any information or to make any representation concerning the Company 
or the offer of the Shares other than the information contained in this Memorandum and any other documents 
relating to the Company, and, if given or made, such information or representation must not be relied upon as 
having been authorised by the Company, any Service Provider or the initiators. 
Any translation of this Memorandum or of any other transaction document into any other language will 
only be for convenience of the relevant Investors having requested such translation. In the case of any 
discrepancy due to translation, the English version of the Memorandum and of any other transaction 
document will prevail.

Certain personal data of Investors (including, but not limited to, the name, address and invested amount of each 
Investor) may be collected, recorded, stored, adapted, transferred or otherwise processed and used by the 
Company, the General Partner, the Services Providers and the financial intermediaries of such Investors. In 
particular, such data may be processed for the purposes of account and distribution fee administration, 
anti-money laundering and terrorism financing identification, maintaining the register of Investors, processing 
subscription, redemption and conversion orders (if any) and payments of dividends to Investors and to provide 
client-related services. Such information shall not be passed on to any unauthorised third persons. 
The Company may sub-contract to another entity (the Processor) (such as the Administrator) the processing of 
personal data. The Company undertakes not to transfer personal data to any third parties other than the 
Processor except if required by law or on the basis of a prior consent of the Investors. 
Each Investor has a right of access to his/her/its personal data and may ask for a rectification thereof in case 
where such data is inaccurate or incomplete. 
By subscribing to the Shares, each Investor consents to such processing of its personal data. This consent is 
formalised in writing in the Subscription Agreement used by the relevant intermediary.
