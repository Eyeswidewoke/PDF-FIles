Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide 
§ 14 
C. (U) If the suspected abuse involves any other person outside the United States, FBI 
employees should consult with the LEGAT and/or the RSO regarding reporting laws of 
the foreign country and act accordingly. FBI employees may request the LEGAT or RSO 
report the suspected activity to the host government on their behalf. 
14.8.7 
(U) SPECIFIC PROCEDURES FOR SUSPECTED HUMAN TRAFFICKING OF FOREIGN 
NATIONAL MINORS 
(U//FOUO) In accordance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) and 22 
U.S.C. 7105(b)(I)(H), FBI employees are required to notify the US Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) within 24-hours upon determining a foreign national child may be the 
victim of human trafficking. FBI employees must complete the FD-1181, "Notification to HHS 
of Suspected Trafficking of a Foreign National Child" and send it by UNet email to the HHS 
Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) (childtrafficking@actihs.gov). After notifying HHS 
OTIP, FBI employees must serialize the completed FD-I181 in the relevant investigative case 
file in Sentinel. If no relevant investigative case file exists, FBI employees must serialize the 
form in a zero file. If FBI employees are notifying HHS of multiple potential victims at one time, 
an LHM or a spreadsheet with consolidated victim information may be appended to one 
FD-1181 form in lieu of completing multiple FD-1181 forms. 
(U) If operational circumstances preclude an FBI employee from completing an FD-1181 within 
24-hours, the employee may instead notify HHS OTIP by phone (202-205-4582) or by email 
(without an attached form). In such circumstances, the FBI employee must serialize a completed 
FD-1181, (or otherwise consolidated victim information) to the investigative case file (or zero 
file, if appropriate) in Sentinel as soon as practicable. When notifying HHS without an FD-1181, 
the FBI employee should provide the following information (to the extent known and 
applicable): 
A. (U) The child victim's name, age, location, and country of origin. 
B. (U) The suspected location of exploitation and suspected form of trafficking. 
C. (U) Contact information for the assigned VSP and case agent. 
(U) After notification to HHS without a completed FD-1181, the FBI employee must serialize a 
completed FD-1181 to the investigative case file or zero file in Sentinel as soon as practicable. 
(U) When the above information (A-C) is properly documented in an FD-1181 and serialized in 
Sentinel, FBI employees are not required to complete an FD-999 form to document the 
dissemination of victim information to HHS. Additionally, FBI employees are not permitted to 
complete an FD-999 in lieu of completing an FD-1181. 
(U) FBI employees should contact Victim Services Division's (VSD) Child Victim Services Unit 
(CVSU) with questions about this notification process. 
14.8.8 
(U) MEANS AND MANNER OF DISSEMINATION 
(U) FBI employees may determine the most appropriate means and manner of disseminating 
information to SLIT LE agencies (see DIOG subsection 14.8.2) and CPS agencies (see DIOG 
subsection 14.8.3), as long as the information is disseminated without delay. See DIOG 
subsection 14.8.8.1 for specific documentation requirements. If state or local laws prescribe a 
particular method of reporting, FBI employees must comply with such laws.
