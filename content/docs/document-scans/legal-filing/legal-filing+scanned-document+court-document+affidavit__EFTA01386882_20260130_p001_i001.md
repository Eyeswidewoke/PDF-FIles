RISKS RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL OBLIGATIONS 
Below Investment-Grade Assets 
The Collateral Obligations acquired by the Issuer will consist primarily of non-investment grade loans or interests in 
non-investment grade loans that are subject to, credit, interest rate, illiquidity and other risks. It is anticipated that the 
Assets generally will be subject to greater risks than investment grade obligations. These risks could be exacerbated if the 
Portfolio is concentrated in certain sectors of infrastructure debt. See also "Certain Risks of Infrastructure Debt—Illiquidity in 
Infrastructure Finance' below. 
Risks of Default and Recovery Levels on the Collateral Obligations 
While infrastructure debt historically experiences low default rates as compared to other industry sectors, a non-investment 
grade debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade debt obligation is generally considered speculative in nature 
and for a variety of reasons may become a Defaulted Obligation. A Defaulted Obligation may become subject to substantial 
workout negotiations or restructuring, which may result in reductions in the interest rate, principal write downs or changes in 
the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. In addition, negotiations in a workout or 
restructuring may be protracted and may result in uncertainty as to the timing and amount of recovery on a Defaulted 
Obligation. The actual recovery experienced on any Defaulted Obligation will likely differ from, and could be lower than, the 
recovery rate used by the Issuer when making its investment in the related Collateral Obligation. 
Limited Information about Collateral Obligations 
Neither the Issuer nor the Portfolio Advisor are required to provide the Preferred Shareholders with financial or other 
information that it receives in connection with the Collateral Obligations unless required under the Transaction Agreements. 
The Preferred Shareholders will not have any right to inspect any records relating to the Collateral Obligations, and the 
Portfolio Advisor will not be obligated to disclose any information regarding the existence or terms of, or the identity of any 
Obligor on, any Collateral Obligation, except to the extent required under the Transaction Agreements. The Portfolio Advisor 
may, with respect to any information that it elects to disclose, demand that persons receiving such information execute 
confidentiality agreements before being provided with the information. 
Lender Liability Considerations 
A number of judicial decisions have upheld judgments of borrowers against lending institutions on the basis of various 
evolving legal theories, collectively termed lender liability". There can be no assurance that such claims will not arise or that 
the Issuer will not be subject to liability upon the occurrence of such a claim. With respect to Collateral Obligations that are 
obligations of non-U.S. Obligors, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders, 
with consequences that may or may not be analogous to lender liability under United States federal and state laws. 
Voting Rights on Collateral Obligations 
As a holder of an interest in a Collateral Obligation, the Issuer has limited consent and control rights which may not be 
effective in view of the typically low proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Portfolio Advisor will continue to 
exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer's rights in connection with the Collateral 
Obligations, or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any Collateral Obligation in accordance with the applicable 
Facility documentation, its portfolio advisory practices and the standard of care set forth in the Portfolio Advisory Agreement. 
The Portfolio Advisor's ability to change the terms of the Collateral Obligations are generally not be restricted by the 
applicable Facility documentation. The Preferred Shareholders will not have any right to compel the Portfolio Advisor to take 
or refrain from taking any actions. My amendment, waiver or modification of a Collateral Obligation could postpone or 
reduce proceeds on the Collateral Obligations and, in turn, may postpone any expected date of final redemption of the 
Securities and/or reduce or delay payments on the Preferred Shares.
