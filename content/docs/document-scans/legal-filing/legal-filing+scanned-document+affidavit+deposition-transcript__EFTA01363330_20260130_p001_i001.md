2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93633, * 
Judgment. isithout seeking leave of court. (4) North Shore has never complied with the discovery deadlines. North 
Shore apparently views court-imposed deadlines as suggestions rather than as Orders compelling timely performance. 
(May 26, 2010, Bankr. Summ. J. 7, ECF No. 1, Ex. 3). 
North Shore has a sufficient history of dilatoriness in this matter such that the third Poulis 
factor weighs in favor of dismissal. See, e.g., Buccolo, 308 Fed. Appx. 574, at *575 
(affirming district court's dismissal of the bankruptcy appeal for failure mks prosecute 
where appellant "did not comply with the Bankruptcy Rules for filing a brief within 15 days 
of the docketing of his appeal... or for providing for the transcript of the Bankruptcy Court 
proceedings..." noting that [HN8] "[ejither of these violations is grounds for dismissal 
under Bankruptcy Rule 8001"). 
4. Willfulness and Sae Faith 
[HN9) The fourth Poulis factor considers whether the conduct of the appellant or of the 
appellant's attorney was willful or in bad faith. 747 F.2d at 868. North Shore failed to 
comply with the Court's original scheduling order, failed to move for an extension of time 
within which to file its brief until more than six months after the original filing deadline, and 
has failed to comply with the Court's new scheduling order. In explaining its failure to follow 
the Court's original scheduling order, North Shore referred generally to the hustle and 
bustle of the bankruptcy proceedings. North Shore also pointed to the size of its legal team 
and financial resources. 
North Shore's explanations for its delays are unpersuasive. By failing to file an appellant's 
brief or timely move for an extension of time within which to do so, North Shore has 
demonstrated a willful [" 14] disregard for the Court's scheduling orders and for the 
appellate process in general. See, e.g., In re Toys Inc., 263 Fed. Appx. at 238 (finding that 
"the record provides a basis to conclude that [the appellant's] conduct showed willful 
disregard for the appellate process" because "[h]e ignored the deadlines issued by the 
District Court"). The fourth Poulis factor therefore weighs in favor of dismissal. 
5. Eff es-beefless of Alternative Sanctions 
[HN10] The fifth Poulis factor assesses the effectiveness of sanctions other than 
dismissal. 747 F.2d at 868. North Shore has not suggested any such sanctions. A possible 
alternative to dismissal would be to grant North Shore an extension of time within which to 
file its appellant's brief. However, the Court has already granted such an extension. 
Granting any further extension would reward North Shore's blatant failure to comply with 
this Court's orders by allowing it to file an opening brief more than 22 months after the 
commencement of its appeal. 
The Court could also impose a fine against North Shore's counsel as a penalty for its 
failure to comply with the scheduling orders in this matter. See Poulis, 747 F.2d at 869. 
Alternatively, the Court could ["15] consider the propriety of ordering North Shore to pay 
Carroll's attorney's fees associated with filing the instant motion. See id. However, North 
Shore has made it clear that its financial resources available to prosecute this matter are 
very limited. Thus, it is unlikely that North Shore will have the ability to comply with a
