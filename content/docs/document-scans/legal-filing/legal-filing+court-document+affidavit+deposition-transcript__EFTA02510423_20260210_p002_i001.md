obfuscation. you were given the clear =AO choice but to save money My team was not hired to do the contracting. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given=by me„ 
detailed but ignored by your people. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and did the =runt work myself 
),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? that being said If you do the cold calculation starting from where you were, to 
where you are currently =C2 . you made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating down my original amount requested ,=calling 
upon our friendship and suggesting that the carlyn mess was partially my fault. ( though in that specific example , I had 
n=ver been asked to do more than provide you the name of the most highly recognized =attny in the field, not 
consulted or even asked =long the way ). I accepted the discount. suggesting now, that Tom is now that last word on 
tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-. however - that is all in the past. 
I would ask that you realize that unlike yours, My=20 business is only comprised of my personal attention and my 
personal time =AO . time that I grossly overspent on your issues last year. . As you are my close friend I will not have 
you participate in a bidding process that I will have for my time this ye=r. I would also ask that you keep in mind that 
Though our deal expired months ago. (even apart from the f=ct that your understanding of the final terms neither 
reflected emails or my memory, we finished up your way. ) I have answered every call brad , joslin, ada or you have 
made . reviewed docs over and over/ until again I was forced to =AO insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous 
not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions last=20 year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate 
some of you= concerns , but I am under no circumstances , none, willing to work any mor= for free. its not fair. I was 
highly aware of the dire circumstances in=20 which you found yourself last year and in fact due to that seriousness. and 
those very circumstanc=s I took extra care in our negotiations . (you had said I had you over a barrel , a horrible position 
to be in with my very close friend., and I fear that if you are not very careful ,in the future, I will hear it again. ) I heard 
you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. You will recall=that you 
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beg=ing as everyone else. I eventually agreed, this of 
course =AO should make clear that the 2014 tax year to close oct 2015 =s not convered at all. As you said ,I have 
produced results far in excess of even my own exal=ed opinion of my projections. I have devoted a monumental 
amount ofmy limited amount of =AO time-- way, way in excess of our agreement. I am willing to roll in the amount still 
outstanding=20 from last year if that helps you .. However, As my best student =, and my only one, you are now 
capable of doing most not all of the req=ired work yourself. I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and 
just have fun, trade st=ries,. share moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you 
choose that route .. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to =pend any more money on mine .
