Our success depends on our ability to at 'ad and retain key employees and the succession of senior management as well as team members 
within stores. 
Our continued growth and suceiss requires us to hire, retain and develop our leadership bench. If we arc unable to attract and retain 
talented, highly qualified senior management and other key executives, as well as provide for the succession of senior management. our growth and 
results of operations may be adversely impacted. 
Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain employees who understand and appreciate our culture 
and are able to represent our brand effectively, including our Pet Detectives who interact with consumers in stores. If we arc unable to attract, train 
and retain new employees and new team members to act as Pet Detectives, this could delay or prevent the implementation of our business strategy 
and in turn, lead to fewer sales of our products. In addition, we have in the past been a defendant in a purported class action by former and current 
Pet Detectives, which alleged certain violations of wage and labor laws in California and Oregon, and we may be subject to other claims in the 
future. 
Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of our Common Stock

Our Sponsor will continue to control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock after completion of this offering. 
Under NASDAQ rules a listed company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by another person or 
group of persons acting together is a "controlled company- and such a company may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate 
governance requirements, including the requirement (1) that a majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors, (2) to have a 
nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the 
committee's purpose and responsibilities, (3) to have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written 
charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities, (4) that the compensation committee consider certain independence factors when 
engaging compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisors and (5) for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating 
and corporate governance and compensation committees. We have elected to be treated as a "controlled company" following this offering. 
Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ 
corporate governance requirements. 
Our Sponsor controls us and its interests may conflict with yours in the future. 
Immediately following this offering, our Sponsor will beneficially own 
% of our common stock, or 
% if the underwriters exercise in 
full their over-allotment option to purchase additional shares from the selling stockholders. Our Sponsor will be able to control the election and 
removal of our directors and thereby determine our corporate and management policies, including potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of 
dividends, asset sales, amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and muttd bylaws and other significant 
corporate transactions for so long as our Sponsor and its affiliates retain significant ownership of us. This concentration of our ownership may 
delay or deter possible changes in control of the Company, which may reduce the value of an investment in our common stock. So long as our 
Sponsor continues to own a significant amount of our combined voting power, even if such amount is less than 50%, our Sponsor will continue to 
be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions and, so long as our Sponsor and its affiliates collectively own at least 5% of all 
outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, it will be able to appoint individuals to our Board of Directors 
under the amended and restated investor rights agreement we have entered into with the Sponsor. See "Certain Relationships and Related Party 
Transactions — Investor Rights Agreement." The interests of our Sponsor may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common 
stock.
