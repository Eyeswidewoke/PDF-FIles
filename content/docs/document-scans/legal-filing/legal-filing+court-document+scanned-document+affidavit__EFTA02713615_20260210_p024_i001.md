ALLOCATION OF GAINS AND LOSSES; NEW ISSUES 
Capital Accounts 
Upon each Partner's admission to the Partnership, a capital account ("Capital Account") 
will be established on the books of the Partnership for such Partner in the amount of such 
Partner's initial capital contribution. A separate Capital Account will be established for each 
capital contribution made by a Partner to the Partnership for purposes of calculating the Incentive 
Allocation (as defined below). The term "Capital Account" as used throughout this document 
shall be deemed to refer to all of a particular Partner's capital accounts in the aggregate. 
Incentive Allocation 
At the end of each accounting period of the Partnership, any net capital appreciation' or 
net capital depreciation2 is tentatively allocated to all Partners (including the General Partner) in 
proportion to each Partner's opening Capital Account for such accounting period. At the end of 
each fiscal year of the Partnership or upon a Partner's withdrawal of all or any portion of the 
capital in his Capital Account, fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate net capital appreciation 
(determined after all Partnership expenses are taken into account) allocated to each Capital 
Account (or the withdrawing Limited Partner's applicable Capital Account with respect to the 
capital so withdrawn) for such fiscal year (or elapsed portion thereof) will be reallocated to the 
Capital Account of the General Partner (the "Incentive Allocation"). The Incentive Allocation 
will be calculated gross of any tax withholdings made by the Partnership with respect to a 
Limited Partner. 
For purposes of calculating the Incentive Allocation for each Capital Account of a 
Limited Partner, net capital appreciation with respect to such Capital Account will be deemed 
reduced by the unrecovered balance, if any, in the Loss Recovery Account corresponding to such 
Capital Account. The Loss Recovery Account is a memorandum account, established for each 
Capital Account upon the establishment of such Capital Account, the opening balance of which 
is zero. At each date that an Incentive Allocation is to be determined, the balance in each Loss 
Recovery Account will be charged with aggregate net capital depreciation allocated to the 
corresponding Capital Account since the last date on which a calculation of the Incentive 
Allocation was made (or in the case of the first such calculation for a Capital Account, since the 
creation of such Capital Account) and credited, but not above zero, by aggregate net capital 
appreciation allocated to the corresponding Capital Account since such date. In the event that a 
Limited Partner with an unrecovered balance in a Loss Recovery Account withdraws a portion of 
"Net capital appreciation" refers to the excess, if any, of the value of the Partnership's net assets at the end 
of each accounting period (without taking into account withdrawals of capital at the end of the accounting period 
and determined after taking all Partnership expenses into account) over the value of the Partnership's net assets at 
the beginning of such accounting period (determined after giving effect to capital contributions made effective as of 
the beginning of such accounting period).

period (without taking into account withdrawals of capital at the end of the accounting period and determined after 
taking all Partnership expenses into account).
