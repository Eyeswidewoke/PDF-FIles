<tel:i 
> . However, I am unavailable =omorrow (Monday) because of prior commitments until 
approximately 7:45 =M. 
Next, you should know that ='m not an employee of CFI nor do I have any 
authority to speak =n behalf of CFI. I'm writing to you from my personal email =ccount in part to underscore that point. I 
do retain a CFI email =ddress in part as a courtesy to me and in part because it serves a =usiness purpose (for example, I 
still receive occasional emails =ddressed to the president of the organization). 
Turning to the substance of your allegations, first you =hould be aware that I 
take the issue of sexual harassment very =eriously. This is confirmed by the fact that after I was hired by CFI =s its in-
house lawyer (a position I held prior to becoming president =nd CEO) I insisted that the organization adopt a 
comprehensive =ero-tolerance harassment policy covering workplace harassment. =oreover, during the time I was 
president and CEO we had three separate =tate trainings for the entire staff on sexual harassment issues. In =ddition, 
where necessary, we did not hesitate to expend significant =esources, including retaining outside investigators, to 
conduct =erious, detailed inquiries into harassment claims. One such inquiry =ost the organization over $40,000. 
Therefore, any suggestion that I do =ot personally take harassment claims seriously is amply disconfirmed by =y record. 
Regarding the alleged =ncident on the 2011 cruise, the first I became aware of it 
was when Pat =eauchamp, CFI's business manager and the employee responsible =or cruise logistics, wrote to me in 
2013 indicating she objected to =nviting Lawrence Krauss on our upcoming Galapagos cruise. I found this =trange, and I 
responded to her almost immediately asking the reasons =or her objection. She gave two reasons. The first was that 
Krauss did =ot pay sufficient attention to the guests on the 2011 cruise. I had =eard this concern from one guest myself; 
on the other hand, I also =eard from several guests that they thought Krauss's =resentations were excellent and a 
highlight of the cruise. Accordingly, = did not give this concern much weight. 
The second reason was that =rauss had allegedly asked a female guest on the 
cruise to join him and =is partner, apparently for some sort of sexual activity (I cannot =ecall whether Krauss was 
engaged or married or just seriously involved =ith his female companion at the time, although they were clearly 
=omantically involved and seemed very much in love). This is the first I =ad heard of this proposition. No complaint by 
the guest or anyone else =ad been made to me at the time of the cruise, although I was on the =ruise and clearly visible 
throughout the cruise. 
I asked Ms. Beauchamp for contact information for this guest. = did call the 
guest and she substantially confirmed what Ms. Beauchamp =ad said. I apologized on behalf of the organization. The 
guest =ndicated although she was taken aback by Krauss's proposition =t the time, she did not want to pursue the 
matter further. I then got =n contact with Krauss. Krauss denied the allegation. In light of the =uest's reluctance to 
pursue the matter and Krauss's own =enial and, importantly, because between the time of the 2011 cruise and =he 
Galapagos cruise we had instituted a policy regarding harassment =tanyCFl event, which covers not just employees, but 
speakers =nd attendees, I decided to go ahead with my plan and have Krauss as a =peaker on the Galapagos cruise. 
Krauss was fully aware of our =arassment policy regarding CFI events because we had had a discussion =bout it. 
Therefore, I expected him to comply with that policy on the =alapagos cruise. As far as I know he did, because we 
received no =omplaints about his conduct. Nor have we received any complaints about =is conduct at other events. 
Let me just =ake a moment to highlight the 2012 policy, which you can find in 
full =ere, 
http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/cfis new_poliry on hostile conduit harassment at conferences/ along 
with the announcement I made explaining the =ationale for the policy. This policy was, certainly at its time, =rguably the 
strongest any nonprofit organization had regarding conduct =t its events. Again, this policy shows that any suggestion 
that CFI, as =n organization, or that I personally took a lax attitude regarding =arassment is completely without factual 
foundation.
