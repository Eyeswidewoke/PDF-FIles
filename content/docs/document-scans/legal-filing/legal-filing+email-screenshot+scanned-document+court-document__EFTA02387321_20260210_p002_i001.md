If it's OK with you, I'd like Bobby Stover to join us on our call on Friday. Bobby heads up our Family Office Advisory 
Services practice and will be best equipped to help answer any questions regarding the proposal. If you're OK with 
Bobby participating I'll circulate a dial-in number for the call. 
Best regards, Jeff
