Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges:We use the Average Daily 
Balance method to calculate Finance Charges on your Account. Under this method, we figure the Finance Charges on your 
Account by applying the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) tor each feature (such as 
Purchasek Cash Acvance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (including current transactions). To get the 
D
Average ary Balance for each feature, we (1 take the beginning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid 
Finance Charges from previous billing periods), 2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) subtract any payments or 
credits, and (4) make any appropriate aclustmen .For each day after the first day or the billing perioid, we also 
add en amount of interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the daily periodic rate 
for the feature. This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for 
the next day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the 
feature for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the biting period. This gives us the Average 
Daily Balance for the feature. For all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance 
be considered to be zero if you paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the 
Payment Due Date shown on that statement. If you multiply the Average Daily -Balance for each feature by the number 
of days in the tiling period and the daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be tie Finance Charge 
assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge for the billing period 
is calculated by adding the Finance Charges assessed on aft features of the Account. This method of ceticulebng the 
Average Deily Balance and Finance Charge results in daily compounding of Finance Charges. The minimum 
Finance Charge for any Wing period in which-Finance Charges are Imposed Is 50.50.
