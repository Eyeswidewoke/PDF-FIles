sex crimes, and some move back and forth. Many investigators consider the pos-
sibility that a nuisance sex offender might progress to more serious crimes in the 
future, but they ignore the possibility that he already has. 
When evaluating nuisance sex offenders, investigators should consider focus, 
escalation, theme, and response to identification. The fact that a nuisance sex 
offender moves from victims meeting general criteria to specific victims is a 
potential danger sign. Escalation over time is also a danger sign. Escalation can be 
evaluated only when there are multiple offenses. Because of the low priority of 
the cases enumerated above, this can be difficult to do. The cases that the investi-
gator believes are the first, second, and third may actually be the tenth, sixteenth, 
and twenty-second. Investigators should also consider the theme of the nuisance 
sex offenses. Not all obscene calls or indecent exposures are the same. As will be 
discussed later in this publication, specific details, not general labels, are needed. 
Lastly, in evaluating dangerousness, investigators should consider the nuisance 
sex offender's reaction to identification. Did he become violent and aggressive? Is 
he indifferent to or aroused by the response of his victims? Is he cooperative? 
Whatever their personal feelings, investigators will almost always get more infor-
mation, details, and admissions from these offenders when they treat them with 
respect, dignity, and empathy. 
When investigations involve multiple offenders, the investigator must recognize 
that the subjects involved could include different kinds of molester patterns. The 
staff at a daycare center where children are being molested might include 
inadequate, seduction, morally indiscriminate, or any other combination of the 
previously discussed situational and preferential sex offenders. A religious group 
involved in sexually abusing children might include morally indiscriminate, 
diverse, inadequate, and sadistic patterns of behavior. The behavior of the indi-
viduals involved must be carefully evaluated in order to develop appropriate 
investigative and interview strategies. 
An important application of this typology is the simple recognition that not all 
child molesters are the same. Not all child molesters are pedophiles. Not all child 
molesters are passive, nonaggressive people. Child molesters can look like every-
one else and are motivated by a wide variety of influences. There is no single 
investigative or interview technique to deal with all of them. • 
It is commonly accepted that incestuous fathers are typically regressed child 
molesters who molest only their own children, do not collect child pornography, 
and are best dealt with in noncriminal treatment programs. This may be true 
some of the time, maybe even most of the time, but it is not true all of the time. 
There are cases in which the incestuous father is a seduction or introverted pref-
erential-type child molester (i.e., pedophile) who "married" simply to gain 
access to children. In many cases he has molested children outside the marriage 
or children in previous "marriages." The possibility that an incestuous father might 
molest children outside the home or commit other sex offenses seems to be 
beyond the comprehension of many child-abuse professionals. Even when they 
intellectually admit the possibility, their professional actions indicate otherwise.
