44 Misc. 3d 280, *; 982 N.Y.S.2d 868,
2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1404, ***; 2014 NY Slip Op 24083 
LLC, and that Benevento holds a beneficial interest in 2784 LLC in his own right in the 
same way that he holds a beneficial interest in Neptune LLC. 
p293] Thus, Neary and Benevento do not lack standing to maintain this action. Dismissal 
of this action, pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (3), ["""23] must, therefore, be denied. 
Burns further contends that plaintiffs have failed to join the other members of 2784 LLC 
and that, therefore, this action must be dismissed, pursuant to [HN4] CPLR 3211 (a) (10), 
which provides for the granting of dismissal of a claim against a party based upon the 
ground that "the court should not proceed in the absence of a person who should be a 
party." 
[3] This contention by Burns is devoid of merit since plaintiffs' second amended complaint 
asserts direct claims by plaintiffs to recover for distinct injuries that they individually 
sustained by Burns' alleged wrongful withholding of their proportionate share of 
distributions of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2784 premises. Plaintiffs are thus 
alleging claims based upon the breach of a duty owed directly to them, independent of any 
duty owed to 2784 LLC or any of its other members (see generally Abrams v Donati, 66 
NY2d 951, 953, 489 NE2d 751, 498 NYS2d 782 [1985], rearg denied 67 NY2d 758, 490 
NE2d 1234, 500 NYS2d 1028 [1986];Behrens v Metropolitan Opera Assn., Inc., 18 AD3d 
47, 50, 794 NYS2d 301 [1st Dept 2005]; Lawrence Ins. Group, Inc. v KPMG Peat Marwick 
LLP, 5 AD3d 918, 919, 773 NYS2d 164 [3d Dept 2004]). Plaintiffs do not seek to recover 
any sums that may be due to the other members of r'24] 2784 LLC or for any damage 
to 2784 LLC. Plaintiffs' claims relate only to their own direct claims as against Burns and 
2784 LLC and, as a result, do not require the joinder of the other members of 2784 LLC. 
Consequently, ['"878] dismissal of plaintiffs' action for failure to join necessary parties 
must be denied. 
Burns also contends that this action must be dismissed, pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7), 
based upon plaintiffs' failure to state a cause of action. [HN5] "It is well settled that, as a 
general rule, on a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action 
under CPLR 3211 (a) (7), the complaint must be construed in the light most favorable to 
the plaintiff' (Gruen v County of Suffolk, 187 AD2d 560, 562, 590 NYS2d 217 [2d Dept 
1992]; see also Rosen v Watermill Dev. Corp., 1 AD3d 424, 425, 768 NYS2d 474 [2d Dept 
2003)), and the pleading is to be afforded a liberal construction (CPLR 3026). The court 
must also accept the facts as alleged in the complaint and submissions in opposition to the 
motion as true and accord the plaintiff "the benefit of every possible favorable inference" 
(Sokoloff v Harriman Estates Dev. Corp., 96 NY2d 409, 414, 754 NE2d 184, 729 NYS2d 
425 [2001]; see also Thomas v LaSalle Bank N.A., 79 AD3d 1015, 1017, 913 NYS2d 742 
[2d Dept 2010]). r25] The court, in accepting the facts p294] alleged in the complaint 
to be true, must " 'determine only whether the facts alleged fit within any cognizable legal 
theory " (Ruffin° v New York City Tr. Auth., 55 AD3d 817, 818, 865 NYS2d 667 [2d Dept 
2008], quoting Moms v Morris, 306 AD2d 449, 451, 763 NYS2d 622 [2d Dept 2003]; see 
also Hurrell-Harring v State of New York, 15 NY3d 8, 20, 930 NE2d 217, 904 NYS2d 296 
[2010]; Goldman v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 5 NY3d 561, 570-571, 841 NE2d 742, 807 
NYS2d 583 [2005]). 
Burns argues that plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action because there was no 
wrongdoing by him. Burns' attorney asserts that Bums sent emails discussing at length
