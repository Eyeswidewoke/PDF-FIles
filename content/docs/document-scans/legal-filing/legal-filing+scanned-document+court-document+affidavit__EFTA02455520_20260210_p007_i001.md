the life sciences that drug efficacy and safety can be masked when the traditional human population studies are used to 
assess drug safety and efficacy. These studies neglect to account for the unique genetic background of the individual 
subjects, with growing evidence that such differentiation is critical to the accurate assessment of pharmaceutical 
therapy efficacy and safety. 
The use of the advances in genomics and gene sequencing technology underlies precision personalized 
medicine. These advances are revolutionizing cancer care as well the management of other disorders with the 
identification of genetic markers that can predict with great accuracy the proper selection of pharmaceuticals to 
maximize efficacy and minimize adverse events. The old adage that one man' medicine may be another's poison remains 
all too true. Removing penicillin from the pharmaceutical armamentarium because some people have severe allergies is 
a false logic which would lead to more deaths because those who would benefit are deprived the drug. Likewise, 
rejecting a potentially beneficial drugs because a subset of the population does not benefit or has adverse effects is 
illogical. The identification of those who would benefit and those who would be harmed should be the priority. 
Pharmaceutical submissions to the FDA should include genomic analysis of subject populations and outcomes. A 
national database of robust post-marketing surveillance, including genomics, would greatly enhance public health and 
safety and should be an integral part of the precision medicine initiative. 
The FDA and congress needs to take the lead, and public health and safety should be its priorities. 
Grandfathered status of unapproved drugs should be withdrawn and safety and efficacy confirmed to allow continued 
access to the the marketplace. All drugs marketed to the public and professions, including over the counter, 
supplements, nutraceuticals, and probiotics, should have established minimal standards of safety and efficacy if any 
beneficial or therapeutic claims are made in their marketing. The public must recognize that a perfect safety record 
cannot be reasonably expected, as even aspirin could not pass the excessive FDA requirements for drug safety today, yet 
it is one of our most effective drugs. 
Comprehensive and conscientious post marketing surveillance should be required for all drugs in the 
marketplace, with an emphasis on identifying precision genomic information to enhance further safety by identifying 
sub-populations with optional benefits and higher risk of adverse events. The cross referencing of poly-pharmacy risk of 
drug-drug interaction including over the counter (OTC), nutraceuticals, probiotics, etc., and other data end points such 
as gender, age, ethnicity, health and disease status, while preserving individual privacy rights to provide further clinically 
relevant safety and efficacy insights from metadata analysis, should be encouraged. The requirement to meet 
established minimal standards of safety and efficacy should be mandatory for any product sold and marketed as 
therapeutic. 
Using sophisticated post-marketing surveillance can create a more responsive and resilient FDA, reduce 
pharmaceutical development costs, enhance the efficiency and timeline of the product advancement pipeline, offer 
greater therapeutic options to the health care professions and consumers, and greatly enhance the ability to identify 
and respond to drug safety issues. This is especially true by bringing grandfathered drugs into compliance, these costs 
savings alone could make this initiative budget neutral. The drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy should be accessible 
to the children and families who are already suffering from a terrible disease, and should not be subjected to misguided 
and unreasonable overregulation. 
By bringing grandfathered drugs out from a regulatory moratorium loophole and monopoly protection 
the FDA will save hundreds of thousands more lives than any denial of novel therapies for rare diseases might cause if 
granted on the basis of compassion. Even if the drug subsequently fails after post-marketing surveillance, it contributes 
to future progress. It is time for the public to insist that the FDA and Congress submit to a dose of common sense, and 
move beyond repeated half-hearted failed attempts and embrace a future of enhanced public health and safety. 
Unquestionably there will a high expense to implement an effective pharmaceutical safety and efficacy program based 
on objective science. The cost savings to the consumer, insurance, government, industry, and public at large will more 
than offset this expense.
