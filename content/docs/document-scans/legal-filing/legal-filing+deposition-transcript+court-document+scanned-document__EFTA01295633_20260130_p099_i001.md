2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
direct conversations with Brito regarding the status of payments owed to the Plaintiff. (Id., 
1116.) Such conduct demonstrated BIC's "apparent, if not actual, insider position with 
Bunkering ["7] and BTU." (Id.) 
Through this conduct and course of dealings over time. (BIC) created and assumed certain duties, including the duty to 
conduct its brokerage activities with reasonable skill and diligence. the duty to engage in due diligence. and the duty to 
inform (the Plaintiff), its principal, of material information t acquired through the exercise of reasonable diligence, as a 
result of its expansive, close individual dealings with Bunkering, BTU and Brito. 
. All of this created a custom and practice over time between (BIC) and (the Plaintiff) and established a course of 
dealings upon which [the Plaintiff] reasonably relied and placed its trust as was intended by (BIC) and resulted in the 
creation of a "speciar or fiduciary relationship between (the Plaintiff] and (BIC), 
(Id., ¶¶18-19) 
C. The transactions at issue. 
Central to this action are two agreements--"STEM 6277" and "STEM 6322"--involving the 
sale and repurchase of oil. The Plaintiff describes these transactions "as a close-in-time 
purchase (by [the Plaintiff]) and sale (by Bunkering or BTU) of oil or fuel oil by-product on 
the promise that "Specialty" (i.e., Bunkering or BTU, depending on the transaction), would 
buy ["8] the product back at a higher price." (Id., ¶ 13.) BIC brokered both agreements. 
(Id., 1111. 29j 
Pursuant to the STEM 6277 agreement, on January 11, 2013, the Plaintiff paid BTU 
$2,828,322.00 for the purchase of 22,447 barrels of cutterstock,' and BTU was obligated to 
purchase those barrels back in thirty days at the price of $2,857,503.10. (Id., ¶ 29(a).) 
Subsequently, BTU requested, and the Plaintiff agreed, to roll over the agreement four 
times such that the due date for BTU's payment for the repurchase of the fuel-oil was 
extended into August 2013 and interest was added to the outstanding payment. (Id.) On 
July 24, 2013, the Plaintiff received $1,500,000.00 in partial satisfaction of the outstanding 
debt. (Id.) However, the remainder has not been paid. Thus, the Plaintiff alleges that it is 
still owed $1,532,589.70, plus interest, under the STEM 6277 agreement. (Id.) 
3 Cultentock, apparently, is a fuel-oil product. 
STEM 6322 involved two payments by the Plaintiff to Bunkering for the purchase of a total 
of 23,500 barrels of Number 2 diesel fuel, which Bunkering was required to purchase back. 
(Id., ¶ 29(b).) Pursuant to the STEM 6322 agreement, on April 22, 2013, the Plaintiff paid 
Bunkering [" 9] $1,600,000.00 for a portion of the diesel fuel, and Bunkering was obligated 
to purchase that portion back in thirty days at the price of $1,616,377.93. (Id.) On May 21. 
2013, the Plaintiff paid Bunkering $1,384,500.00 for the remainder of the diesel fuel, and 
Bunkering was obligated to repurchase that amount in thirty days at the price of 
$1,398,671.94. (Id.) As with the STEM 6277 agreement, the STEM 6322 agreement was 
rolled over multiple times such that the due date for Bunkering's payment was extended to 
August 2013 and interest was added to the balance. (Id.) However, the Plaintiff received 
no payments from Bunkering and, therefore, Bunkering owes the Plaintiff $3,092,527.82, 
plus interest, under the STEM 6322 agreement. (Id.)
