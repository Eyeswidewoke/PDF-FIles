Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus 
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the 
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the 
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client 
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax 
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of 
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets, The index fixings may - by 
construction - lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of 
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed 
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs 
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to 
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements. 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The 
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their 
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should 
take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this 
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the 
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the 
amount of funds initially deposited - up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not 
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of 
Standardized Options", at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risksisp. If you are unable to 
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can 
be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous market factors, 
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in 
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could 
affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of an 
underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
