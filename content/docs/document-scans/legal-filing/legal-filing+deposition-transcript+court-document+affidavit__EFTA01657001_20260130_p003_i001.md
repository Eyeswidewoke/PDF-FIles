3) Unusual eye movements or contact—blinking, squinting, exaggerated movements, and look-
ing down or around the room. 
This triad of indicators, while only red-flags with limited diagnostic value, can be monitored through-
out an investigative interview but especially during stages where the cognitive load would be expected to 
be greatest for the interviewee, such as during an unexpected request to tell the story backward or to draw 
a diagram/sketch of the story. Changes from baseline observed during rapport development could indicate 
deception. 
Research has shown that even with some training, distinguishing truthful from deceptive oral narra-
tives and exchanges based on indicators alone is not an easy task, with accuracy often just above chance 
(9). Interactive strategies for detecting possible deception have proven to be more reliable (10, 11). For 
purposes of the present research, the general CI protocol was merged with reliable findings from the re-
search literature on detecting deception to produce the cognitive interview for suspects (CIS). The CIS 
allows for a non-judgmental approach to interviewing subjects in situations where it is not yet clear 
whether the subject will be honest or deceptive during the interview (12). The same principles that drive 
the memory-enhancement and communications aspects of the CI for cooperative victims and witnesses 
are at work in the CIS. The subject is induced to generate large amounts of information before any chal-
lenge is made. This allows for a greater opportunity to observe inconsistent statements as well as any ver-
bal, vocal, and behavioral signs of deception and changes from baseline (the rapport stage) should they 
occur. This approach reduces the likelihood that the investigator will challenge the subject pm-maturely 
based on any confirmatory bias (13). The CIS also employs two techniques for asking for information in 
ways that are unanticipated by the subject, namely drawing/sketching the story and re-telling the story in 
reverse chronological order. These elements of the CIS provide an opportunity to observe the subject's 
performance under unexpected conditions and elevated levels of cognitive load. 
The eight stages of the full CIS are as follows: 
1. Rapport/Introduction. It is recommended that the interviewer should present him/herself as just 
another person, rather than as a superior person of authority, and show an interest in the subject as an in-
dividual (1). The interviewer should create rapport with the subject using casual conversation in a non-
judgmental manner. This is to put the subject at ease such that the interview will be more productive. In 
this manner, the subject may come to like and even trust the interviewer while talking about shared inter-
ests, real or not (14). As the subject begins to talk truthfully about neutral topics, it may become more dif-
ficult later on for the subject to tell the false story without showing signs of deception. Prisoners who con-
fessed during their police interviews reported that their interviewers had developed rapport with them 
whereas a dominating approach was met with resistance (15). So, disarm a potentially deceptive subject 
with a few minutes of conversation. In addition, the interviewer should observe the subject's general de-
meanor during this chat as a baseline. A change in demeanor later on could indicate deception.
