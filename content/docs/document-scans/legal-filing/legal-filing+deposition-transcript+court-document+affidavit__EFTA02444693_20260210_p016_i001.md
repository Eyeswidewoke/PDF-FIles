IS kE 
U.S. marketing translates more easily across the entire market whereas Europe requires 
multiple marketing efforts. Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and Spain have regionalized 
marketing cultures. 
The U.S. has more opportunity to develop scale efficient bottling (e.g., lower labor costs, 
more spare bottling capacity) and distribution (lower fuel/transportation costs). 
lsbre's Plan: Marketing Strategy 
In the North American bottled water market, the Company's strategy is to be a super-premium water 
brand. Isbre's key competitors are Fiji (the top and fastest growing brand), Evian (which has been losing 
share), and Voss (smaller, growing share). 
The roll-out strategy has been planned as a 4 stage process: 
Stage 1: Establish an all-channel distribution network across the greater New York/Philadelphia 
Metropolitan Markets (having a combined population of over 25 million people). This stage has 
bee') st.ccessfg ly c( tig uted 
Stage 2: Achieve widespread, multi-channel retail placement in the Northeast Market. Isbre is now 
available in over 2,000 supermarkets (over 60% of the supermarkets in the region), 3,000 street 
accounts, and over 300 restaurants, hotels, etc. This stage gas also coon corralotec 
Stage 3: Drive case sales through chain or location specific price promotions and other 
promotional events. I g:s stage ts underv,ay.
Stage 4: Launch a highly focused PR campaign, targeting the most likely Isbre consumer 
audiences. This effort will be supported with cost efficient, "rifle shot" specific media spend. 
Steps 1 & 2 are well along and lsbre is now ready to initiate steps 3 & 4. Placement alone will not 
achieve high sales per placement on a widespread basis. The introduction of steps 3 & 4 will allow Isbre 
to take advantage of existing opportunities to dramatically increase sales. Isbre is perfectly poised to 
continue its rollout and reap the benefits of the widespread placement success achieved to date. 
Isbre's marketing strategy is aligned with establishing its position as a U.S. super-premium water brand. 
While Isbre is a new entrant, it will leverage the branding successes of Fiji and Voss. These firms have 
proven the appeal of imported, premium priced bottled water from an exotic source. Fiji, in particular, has 
demonstrated that a water brand from a pristine aquifer source is able to attract an audience that is 
growing faster than the overall water market. 
This leverage gives lsbre greater ability to optimize distribution, since there is now clearly established, 
broad-based awareness of and demand for super-premium water (no longer the province of the most 
expensive venues but now demanded by mass market venues such as supermarkets). Isbre will sell into 
the demand that these brands have created. At the same time, Isbre will provide a high-end alternative to 
consumers and retailers alike by investing heavily in an optimized delivery channel. While lsbre will 
spend on traditional marketing efforts, it will focus on promotional marketing, which is much more tactical. 
PR and media celebrating the unique selling proposition of lsbre will be introduced into each market as 
critical placement levels have been achieved. Isbre's efforts will initially be directed towards securing 
shelf space rather than image creation. These efforts will put Isbre into the right stores in the right places 
to grow its market presence and share from the bottom up. In addition to distribution focused promotional 
pricing, Isbre will utilize a full range of marketing activities, including media advertising, marketing
