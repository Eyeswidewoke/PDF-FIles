Agreement. 
To confirm that our records are accurate, after you open an Account we will send you a record

additional agreements. In such instances, upon approval of your Accounts, features and/or 
services, we will confirm your requests in writing and send you any updates or amendments to 
the Agreement and any disclosures you have not already received. Any authorization of 
features and services you give us will remain in effect until a reasonable time after you notify 
us to terminate the feature or service. 
Your initial acceptance of the Agreement and your continued use of your UBS Accounts will 
serve as your agreement to the application of the Agreement including any updates and 
amendments to all of your Accounts. 
The accounts and services we offer may change over time. We may change our Agreement 
with you at any time by sending you a written notice of the change, and the changes will be 
effective on the date of the notice unless we specify a later date. We also may cease to offer 
services at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of your Accounts and our 
products and services constitutes your acceptance of the new terms and conditions. If you do 
not agree to the terms and conditions, you may cancel the applicable feature or service or 
close your Account. All changes by you to the Agreement will become effective only if offered 
in writing and signed by us.

involving a commodity interest or options, unless and until you complete additional 
agreements with us specifically permitting those transactions.
