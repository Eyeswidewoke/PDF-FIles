PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 
The 11. Audio M600/6 is a six-channel, 
full-range audio amplifier utilizing 
Audio 
NexD' ultra-high speed switching technology to 
deliver outstanding fidelity and efficiency. 
The M600/6 can be operated with a wide 
variety of source units and system configurations. 
TYPICAL INSTALLATION SEQUENCE 
The following represents the sequence 
for a typical amplifier installation, using 
an aftermarket source unit. Additional 
steps and different procedures may be 
required in some applications. If you 
have any questions, please contact your 
authorized IL Audio dealer for assistance. 
I) Disconnect the negative battery post 
connection and secure the disconnected cable 
to prevent accidental re-connection donne 
installation. This step Is not optional. 
2) Run 4 AWG power wire from the battery 
location to the amplifier mounting location. 
taking care to route it in such a way that it 
will not be damaged and will not interfere 
with vessel operation. Use 4 AWG or larger 
power wire and a power distribution block if 
additional amplifiers are being installed with 
the M600/6. 
3) Connect power wire to the positive battery 
post. Fuse the wire with an appropriate fuse 
block (and connectors) within 18 inches (45 
cm) wire length of the positive battery post. 
This fuse is essential to protect the vessel. Do 
not install the fuse until the power wire has 
been securely connected to the amplifier. 
4) Connect negative power wire to the negative 
battery post. Use the same size power 
wire as the wire connected to the "4.12V" 
connection (minimum 4 AWG). 
5) Run signal cables and remote turn•on wire 
from the source unit to the amplifier 
mounting location. 
6) Run speaker cable from the speaker systems 
to the amplifier mounting location. 
7) Securely mount the amplifier. 
8) Connect the positive and negative power 
wires to the amplifier. A fuse near the 
amplifier is not necessary if the M600/6 is the 
only device being run from the fused main 
power wire. If the fused main power wire is 
shared by the M60016 and other amplifiers 
or devices. fuse each amplifier/device 
within 12 inches (30 cm) of wire length. 
via a fused distribution block or multiple 
individual fuse blocks/on-board fuses. 
9) Connect the remote turn-on wire 
to the amplifier. 
10) Connect the input cables to the amplifier. 
11) Connect the speaker cables to the amplifier. 
12) Carefully review the amplifier's control 
settings to make sure that they are set 
according to the needs of the system. 
13) Install the power wire fuse (50A for a 
single M60016) and reconnect the negative 
battery post terminal. Install the fuse (50A) 
near the amplifier (if applicable). 
14) Ilan on the source unit at a low level 
to double-check that the amplifier is 
configured correctly. Resist the temptation 
to crank it up until you have verified the 
control settings. 
15) Make necessary adjustments to the input 
sensitivity controls to obtain the right 
overall output and the desired balance 
in the system. Sec Appendix A (page 14) 
for the recommended input sensitivity 
setting method. 
16) Enjoy the fruits of your labor with your 
favorite music. 
POWER CONNECTIONS 
Fkfore installing the amplifier, disconnect the 
negative (ground) wire from the vessel's battery. 
This will prevent accidental damage to the system. 
the vessel and your body during installation. 
The M600/6's "+12 VDC" and "Ground" 
connections are designed to accept 4 AWG 
power wire. 4 AWG is the required wire size for 
thisamplifier. 
If you are installing the M600/6 with other 
amplifiers and wish to use a single main power 
wire. MSC 2 AWG or 1/0 AWG main power wire 
(depending on the overall current demands of all 
the amplifiers in the system). This 2 AWG or 
I/O AWG power wire should terminate into a 
fused distribution block mounted as close to 
the amplifiers as possible (within 12 inches / 
10cm of wire length). The fused output of the 
distribution block will connect to the M600/6 
with 4 AWG power wire. 11 Audio ECS 
fused distribution blocks are recommended 
(XD-FDBU-2 and XD-FDBU-4) 
Note: Smaller AWG numbers mean bigger 
wire and vice-versa (1/0 AWG is the largest. 2 
AWG is smaller, then 4 AWG, then 8 AWG. etc.). 
To connect the power wires to the amplifier, 
first back out the set screw on the top of the 
terminal block, using the supplied 2.5 mm hex 
wrench. Strip t/2 inch (12 mm) of insulation from 
the end of each wire and insert the bare wire into 
the terminal block, seating it firmly so that no 
bare wire is exposed. While holding the wire in 
place. tighten the set screw firmly, taking care not 
to strip the head of the screw. 
The ground connection should be made using 
the same gauge wire as the power connection. 
Any wires run through barriers must 
be protected with a high quality rubber 
grommet to prevent damage to the 
insulation of the wire. Failure to do so 
may result in a dangerous short circuit. 
['IMPORTANT
Many vessels employ small (10 AWG • 6 AWG) 
wire to connect the alternator's positive 
connection to the battery. To prevent voltage 
drops, this wire should be upgraded to 4 AWG 
when Installing amplifier systems with main 
fuse ratings above 60A. 
It is common for the alternator to be grounded 
through its chassis. If the alternator is not 
grounded through its chassis and instead employs 
a small (10 AWG - 6 AWG) wire to connect to 
ground, this wire should also be upgraded to 4 
AWG when installing amplifier systems with main 
fuse ratings above 60A. 
FUSE REQUIREMENTS 
It is absolutely vital that the main power 
wire(s) to the amplifier(s) in the system be 
fused within 18 Inches (45 cm) of the positive 
battery post connection. The fuse value at each 
power wire should be high enough for all of the 
equipment being run from that power wire. If 
only the M600/6 is being run from that power 
wire, we recommend a 50A fuse be used. 
If fusing the amplifier near its power 
connections (when more than one amp is being 
run from the main power wire), use a 50A fuse. 
MAXI' (big plastic-body) fuses 
are recommended.
