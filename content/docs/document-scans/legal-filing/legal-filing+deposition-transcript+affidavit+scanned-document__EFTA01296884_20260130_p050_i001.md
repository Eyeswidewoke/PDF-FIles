44 Misc. 3d 280, *; 982 N.Y.S.2d 868, "; 
2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1404, ***; 2014 NY Slip Op 24083 
of 44.8% for the estate of John, 18.4% for Grace, 18.4% for the estate of Julia, and 18.4% 
collectively for the Neary group. 
Using the funds obtained from this sale of the 2784 LLC premises, Burns, as the manager 
of 2784 LLC, gave a mortgage and loan from it to Neptune LLC for $250,000 at five 
percent interest with a mortgage on the Neptune Avenue premises to be paid when these 
premises are sold. These monies were allegedly used to buy out the non-family tenants of 
the Neptune Avenue premises so as to have them vacate their apartments there. 
On August 13, 2010, an action was filed by Neptune LLC against Neary, Benevento, 
Carmel Salerno (Carmel), and the estate of Julia (363-367 Neptune Avenue, LW v Neary, 
Sup Ct, [- 285] Kings County, index No. 9282/10, 30 Misc. 3d 779, 917 NYS2d 544) 
["**6] (the Neptune Avenue action) for a judgment requiring Neary, Benevento, and 
Carmel to vacate their apartments, requiring the estate of Julia to take action to remove 
Neary, Benevento, and Carmel from such apartments, and awarding damages in the sum 
of $108,000 against Neary, $216,000 against Benevento, and $324,000 against Carmel 
due to their failure to vacate. In the Neptune Avenue action, Neary and Benevento 
asserted that Burns had harassed them, refused to make repairs to the building, and 
[""872] denied them essential services in an effort to make the building uninhabitable so 
that they would be forced to vacate it. Neptune LLC, in that action, contended that it was 
entitled to sell and vacate the Neptune Avenue premises pursuant to the operating 
agreement for Neptune LLC. By a decision and order dated December 15, 2010, Justice 
Mark I. Partnow denied a motion by Neptune LLC to require Neary, Benevento, and 
Carmel to vacate the Neptune Avenue premises, finding that while Neptune LLC could 
elect to dissolve and sell the premises pursuant to the majority vote of its members, it 
could not evict Neary, Benevento, and Carmel and was required rm to sell the Neptune 
Avenue premises subject to their rent-stabilized leases. 
In December 2010, Burns resigned as the manager of 2784 LLC, and Judice is now its 
current manager. Burns claims that he and now Judice have been distributing 2784 LLC 
funds from the sale of the 2784 premises pro rata to the members after enough cash is 
accumulated and obligations paid, and that plaintiffs admit that they received distributions 
as members. The Neptune Avenue premises have not yet been sold and Benevento and 
Neary remain in occupancy as tenants there. 
On March 18, 2011, plaintiffs filed the instant action, which initially named 2784 LLC and 
Burns, along with McRory and McRory, PLLC and Raymond McRory, Esq. (collectively, 
the McRory defendants), as defendants. On May 2, 2011, plaintiffs served a complaint, 
and, on May 16, 2011, plaintiffs served an amended verified complaint as of right pursuant 
to CPLR 3025 (a). Plaintiffs' amended complaint alleged that Burns, acting on behalf of 
2784 LLC and his [` 286] own personal interests, unilaterally and improperly diverted funds 
belonging to 2784 LLC for purposes unrelated to it, including making payments in excess 
of $200,000 to buy out the tenants who resided rill in the building at the Neptune 
Avenue premises, and making payments of legal fees to the McRory defendants unrelated 
to 2784 LLC. It further alleged that Bums, acting on behalf of 2784 LLC and his own 
personal interests, unilaterally and improperly withheld from the net proceeds realized from 
the sale of the 2784 premises distributions due to them because they had not vacated their 
rent-stabilized apartments at the Neptune Avenue premises. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged
