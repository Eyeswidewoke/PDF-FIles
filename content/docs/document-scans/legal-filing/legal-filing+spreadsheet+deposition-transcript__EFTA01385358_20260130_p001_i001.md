stream, (2) ability to close acquisitions without necessarily increasing leverage, 
(3) free cash flow generation and de-levering starting in 2017, and (4) strong 
liquidity and limited maturities. 
For 2017, we project GLPI to generate adjusted EBITDA of $886 million 
(+23.0% versus 8721 million) on revenues of $973 million (+17.5% versus $828 
million). Factoring the impact from S4 million of capital expenditures, $202 
million of interest expense, $529 million of dividend payments, $10 million of 
cash taxes, $139 million in proceeds from share issuances and $13 million in 
proceeds from dispositions, we estimate free cash flow of $211 million. Using 
our forecast of $4.50 billion of debt and $44 million of cash, we estimate that 
GLPI will end 2017 with gross leverage of 5.1x and net leverage of 5.0x. 
For 2018, we project GLPI to generate adjusted EBITDA of $895 million (+1.0% 
versus $886 million) on revenues of $994 million (+2.0% versus $973 million). 
Factoring the impact from $4 million of capital expenditures, $199 million of 
interest expense, $548 million of dividend payments and $10 million of cash 
taxes, we estimate free cash flow of $134 million. Using our forecast of $4.36 
billion of debt and $44 million of net available cash, we estimate that GLPI will 
end 2018 with gross leverage of 4.9x and net leverage of 4.8x.

Downside risks include deterioration in regional gaming fundamentals, which 
may lead to lower free cash flow generation. 
International Gaining Technology IGT reported a nice 03'17 beat as traction 
across several product lines and discipline around costs appears to be gaining 
steam. Key positives that we identified during the quarter include: (1) strong 
same-store lottery revenue of 9.4% in North America; (2) signs of stabilization 
in the UK lottery; (3) the California contract renewal; (4) positive feedback from 
G2E; and (5) somewhat favorable conditions for the extension of the Italian 
Scratch & Win lottery contract (no tender process & no changes on the terms 
of existing contract). We continue to expect the company will report strong 
04'17 results as lottery headwinds are lapped, new slot content hits floors, and 
certain domestic operators ramp up their capital spend.
