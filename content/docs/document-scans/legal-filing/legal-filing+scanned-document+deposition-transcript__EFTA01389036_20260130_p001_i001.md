CyrusOne 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options", at http://www.optionsclearina.com/about/publications/character-risks.isp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
