It is a rare specta=le to find the Arab League Foreign Ministers formallycal=ing for war crimes prosecutions against a 
fellow Arab leader and his inner cir=le, yet even more striking that US government—which sports a full Office=of Global 
Criminal Justice led by an Ambassador-at-Large, solely for this =urpose—apparently has not seen fit to lead on this issue 
or even consider the threat of war crimes prosecutio= as a potential tool of leverage on Mr. Assad's regime. 
While Hezbollah and=lran's Revolutionary Guards have invested heavily in television and othe= media outlets as a 
means of shaping public opinion to their advantage, th= administration apparently sees no opportunity in the Arab 
world's information domain to expose the cynical and illegit=mate misdeeds of those directly responsible for this crisis. 
And while Pre=ident Obama's June decision to arm and train the Syrian opposition has t=anslated into what the 
Washington Post <http://articles.wa=hingtonpost.com/2013-10-02/world/42616148_1_u-s-intelligence-analysts-
trai=ing-program-rebel> describes chttp://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-10-02/world/4=616148_1_u-s-
intelligence-analysts-training-program-rebel> as a "minuscule" clandestine program, Moscow and Tehran continue a 
robust flow of heavy arms, fighters =nd funds into Syria to sustain the Assad regime. 
In sum, Washington =howl no evidence of mustering either military or nonmilitary tools of infl=ence that would offer a 
credible prospect of rescuing what remains of Syri='s largely defenseless population from the ravages of Bashar al-
Assad's conventional forces. With well over 110=000 killed and an estimated seven million displaced, one third of them 
ove=flowing refugee camps in neighboring countries, one finds no inclination w=thin the Administration to invoke—as it 
had in Libya—the humanitarian intervention doctrine known as Responsi=ility to Protect. Indeed, the US-Russia-Syria 
chemical weapons disarmament=project has become, pace the Nobel Committee, the ethical antithesis of Re=ponsibility 
to Protect, veritably a License to Ignore. 
These policy foible= obscure the larger strategic landscape at play in Syria's conflict. Rus=ia's opportunism in seizing 
upon Secretary Kerry's press remark to off=r full partnership in eliminating Syrian chemical weapons was clearly 
motivated less by the fear of civilian casual=ies from "one stiff breeze" of toxic vapors than by its interest in ke=ping the 
Assad regime in power. Having no other major clients for its arms=export industry since the fall of Muammar Qadhafi, 
no other port of access for its navy in the Levant, and an affini=y for a secular regime—however brutal—that bills itself 
as a bulwark a=ainst Sunni Arab religious extremism, Russia has deftly kept America from =etting in the way of its core 
interests in the region. 
If the Administrati=n sees advantage in giving Moscow a pass over its weapons being used by th= Syrian military to lay 
waste to populated cities and towns, its passivity=toward Iran's regional activities demands explanation. Iran and its 
proxy force Hezbollah have massively supported t=e Assad regime, revealing an historically rare condition of 
vulnerability =o prospective regime change in Damascus. 
Hezbollah, which ha= the blood of US Marines on its hands and has become so heavily armed that=it sustained hostilities 
with Israel for several days in 2006, is now poli=ically exposed back home in Lebanon and throughout the Arab world for 
fighting and killing fellow Muslims in a=neighboring Arab country on behalf of a secular dictatorship. Its operatio=s, 
today as thirty years ago, are wholly dependent on continued support fr=m Tehran. 
The Iranian cleric =eading an organization charged with countering the "soft war" against =he fundamentalist regime in 
Tehran, Hojjat al-Islam Mehdi Taeb, explained <http://iranpulse.al-monitor.com/index.php/2013/02/134=/head-of-
