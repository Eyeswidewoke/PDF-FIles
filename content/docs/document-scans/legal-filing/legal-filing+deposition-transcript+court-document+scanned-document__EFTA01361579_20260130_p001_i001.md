The Talented Mr. Epstein; Lately, Jeffrey Epstein's high-ying style has been drawing oohs 
and aahs: the bachelor nancier lives in New York's largest private residence, claims to 
take only billionaires as clients, and ies celebrities including Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey 
on his Boeing 727. But pierce his air of mystery and the picture changes. VICKY WARD 
explores Epstein's investment career, his ties to retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his 
complicated past Vanity Fair March 2003 
Q: Do you have any expectation of participating in any business venture with Mr. Cayne? 
A: No. 
Q: Have you had any business participations with Mr. Theram? 
A: No; nor do I anticipate any. 
Q: Mr. Epstein, did anyone at Bear Stearns tell you in words or substance that you should 
not divulge anything about St. Joe Minerals to the staff of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission? 
A: No. 
Q: Has anyone indicated to you in any way, either directly or indirectly, in words or 
substance, that your compensation for this past year or any future monies coming to you 
from Bear Stearns will be contingent upon your not divulging information to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission? 
A: No. 
Despite the circumstances of Epstein's leaving, Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his annual 
bonus-which he anticipated as being approximately $100,000. 
The S.E.C. never brought any charges against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider trading 
in St. Joe, but its questioning seems to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein's answers. 
Some sources have wondered why, if he was such a big producer at Bear Steams, he 
would have given it up over a mere $2,500 fine. 
Certainly the years after Epstein left the firm were not obviously prosperous ones. His luck 
didn't seem to change until he met Hoffenberg. 
One of Epstein's first assignments for Hoffenberg was to mastermind doomed bids to take 
over Pan American World Airways in 1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. 
Hoffenberg claimed in a 1993 hearing before a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up 
with the idea of financing these bids through Towers's acquisition of two ailing Illinois 
insurance companies, Associated Life and United Fire. "He was hired by us to work on the 
securities side of the insurance companies and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a 
profit for us and for the companies," Hoffenberg reportedly told the grand jury. He also 
alleged that Epstein was the "technician," executing the schemes, although, having no 
broker's license, he had to rely on others to make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg's 
subsequent testimony in his criminal case has proven to be false, and Epstein has claimed 
he was merely asked how the bids could be accomplished and has said he had nothing to 
do with the financing of them. Yet Richard Allen, the former treasurer of United Fire, recalls 
seeing Epstein two or three times at the company. He and another executive say they had 
direct dealing with Epstein over the finances. And in his deposition of 1989, Epstein stated 
that he was the one who executed "all" Hoffenberg's instructions to buy and sell the stock. 
He called it "making the orders." He could not recall whether he had chosen the brokers 
used.
