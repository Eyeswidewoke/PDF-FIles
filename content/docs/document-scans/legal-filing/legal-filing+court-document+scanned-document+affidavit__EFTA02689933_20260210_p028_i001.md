11. 
ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING REQUIREMENTS 
ILI 
Measures aimed towards the prevention of money laundering as provided by Luxembourg Law 
including CSSF circular 08/387 are the responsibility of the Company and have been delegated (under 
its supervision) to the Administrator. 
11.2 
These measures require, amongst others, that the Administrator requests the verification of the identity 
of any Investor. By way of example, a natural person will be required to provide a copy of his/her 
passport or identification card duly certified by a competent authority (e.g. embassy, consulate, notary, 
police officer, solicitor, financial institution domiciled in a country imposing equivalent identification 
requirements or any other competent authority) and a corporate applicants will be require, amongst 
others, production of a certified copy of the certificate of incorporation (and any change of name), the 
Investor's memorandum (if any) and its articles of association (or equivalent), a recent list of its 
shareholders showing a recent stake in its capital, printed on the letterhead of the Investor duly dated 
and signed, an authorised signature list and an excerpt of the trade register. It should be noted that the 
above list is not exhaustive and that the Investors may be required to provide further information to the 
Administrator in order to ensure the identification of the final beneficial owner of the Shares. 
11.3 
Until satisfactory proof of identity is provided by an Investors or transferees as determined by the 
Administrator, it reserves the right to withhold issue or approval of registration of transfers of Shares. 
Similarly, redemption proceeds will not be paid unless compliance with these requirements has been 
made in full. In any such event, the Administrator will not be liable for any interest, costs or 
compensation. 
11.4 
In case of a delay or failure to provide satisfactory proof of identity, the Administrator may take such 
action as it thinks fit. 
11.5 
Depending on the circumstances of each application for subscription or registration of a transfer of 
Shares, a detailed verification of the applicant's identity might not be required where the application is 
made through a financial institution or intermediary located in a country that is considered by the 
Administrator as imposing identification requirements equivalent to those in place in Luxembourg. 
11.6 
A list of documents to be provided by an Investor for the purpose of the prevention of money 
laundering as provided by Luxembourg Law can be provided by the Administrator upon request.
