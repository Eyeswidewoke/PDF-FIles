We note from a Google search that Spencer Kuvin says on his website that he acted for victims of 
Jeffrey Epstein in 2008. Bearing in mind that it is now 2011, it is extraordinary that our client has 
never received any notice of these proceedings or of the allegations and it is unacceptable that 
against that background you have published such untrue statements. 
Can you please confirm whether or not you were aware of the fact that any such allegations have 
never been put to our client. If you were not aware, then we would ask you to disclose exactly what 
investigations you undertook in relation to this matter before you chose to publish. If you were aware 
of this important fact it will add to the damages that you chose to publish without putting this matter to 
our client. 
You will, of course, appreciate that the allegations you have published are the most serious 
allegations you could make against someone and it is inevitable that our client will suffer severe 
damage to her reputation and financial loss, as a consequence of the publication. We demand that 
you do not repeat the allegations and cause further damage. 
We would ask that you carefully note the following: 
1. Our client was not aware of any improper or unlawful conduct by Jeffery Epstein. 
2. You refer to Spencer Kuvin acting for 14 girls in proceedings against Jeffery Epstein and 
having named our client "as a child abuser". No such allegations have ever been put in any 
form to our client. The first our client knew of this was on reading your article. 
3. Our client has had not NO communications from Spencer Kuvin OR ANYONE IN HIS 
OFFICE AT ANY TIME. 
4. Our client has not been named as a party in any proceedings relating to Jeffrey Epstein's 
unlawful conduct or any other similar conduct by anyone else. 
5. Further, no one has at any time even written to our client making any claims against her. If 
what is being alleged are the genuinely-held beliefs of third parties, the fact that these have 
never even been put to our client is extraordinary and should have indicated to you that they 
were likely to be untrue. 
6. Furthermore, our client has never even been put on notice of any such claim 
7. Our client has never been contacted by any police force or other law enforcement agency in 
connection with any allegations made against Jeffrey Epstein. 
She has absolutely no 
connection to the criminal prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and neither was she approached by 
the defence or the prosecution in that matter. 
8. The only legal process th 
r li nth s ever received is a subpoena for a deposition in civil 
proceedings brought by 
against Jeffery Epstein and not our client. Our client 
was not required to answer the deposition as she was instructed Mr Epstein had settled the 
case. Our client was merely one of many people who were issued with subpoena's in that 
matter. 
9. One of the lawyers primarily responsible for promoting allegations against Jeffrey Epstein 
was Scott Rothstein. In June 2010, Mr Rothstein was sentenced to 50 years imprisonment 
for his involvement in what is reported to have been the largest ever fraud in Florida, a
