which cannot burst through its current abstractions is doomed to sterility after a very limited period of progress:1P Man is 
dead. 
This is the end of the doctrine of specific causation. There are only the simultaneous neural operations of the present, the all-
at-once, the here-and now. No more talk about the environment. The only total situation is in what the brain is doing. There 
is no past, there is no future, there is no time, there is no space. The beginnings, the endings, are all bound up in the 
multiplicity of neural operations. The unity is methodological. Break through the limited framework of subjects and objects. 
ItitTMs all happening at once, bound up in a universe of simultaneity. 
WhoaTMs crazy? Mankind went out of its mind. There is no mind out of which to go. WhoiiTMs crazy? 
aceThe supreme abstraction of the brain was indeed the mind. .. . From the confusion of metaphysics and psychoanalysis, 
abstractions of abstractions, the thinking brain has turned to the first possible glimpses of itsellii" For years man understood 
that animals did not act through a consciousness; now it is evident that man himself, the human animal, did not act with a 
conscious sensibility. ItaTMs all a question of breaking through to new systems of abstraction. 
iiceNeither the presence nor absence of consciousness can serve as an exclusive criterion either for the presence or absence of 
any other characteristic in a particular thing. . . . The only way a particular individual can be determined to be conscious is 
with reference to his observable behavior.V Behavior is a consideration of the past. The present is in the activity of the brain. 
Analyzing the patterns of the present turned the world of man inside out and upside down. Insanity. WhoaTMs crazy? 
eurCogito ergo sum.e I think therefore I am. But the only conclusion to be derived from thought is that the brain has direct 
experience. We are not concerned with the existence of thought but with the activity of the brain. 
There is no conscious self, there is no subconscious, there is no mind. Indeed, the word mental is an liceunfortunate word, a 
word whose function in our culture is often only to stand in lieu of an intelligent explanation, and which connotes rather a 
foggy limbo than a cosmic structural order characterized by patterningin Be concerned with discerning operant patterns on 
the neural level. All experience can be accounted for in terms of neural operations. accOnly by renouncing an explanation of 
life in the ordinary sense do we gain a possibility of taking into account its characteristicsin 
This system of abstraction, based as it is on operant considerations, goes beyond linear systems. Nonlinear processes are 
composed of interacting elements. Common Western language lends itself to pictorial interpretations. But, seethe description 
of many aspects of human existence demands a terminology which is not immediately founded on simple physical pictures.V°
Nonlinear processes can be represented by operant mathematical symbols. Common language is a poor substitute. Pure 
mathematical symbolism allows us to acerepresent relations for which ordinary verbal expression is imprecise or cumbersome. 
In this connection, it may be stressed that, just by avoiding the reference to the conscious subject which infiltrates daily 
language, the use of mathematical symbols secures the unambiguity of definition required for objective description.a2'
