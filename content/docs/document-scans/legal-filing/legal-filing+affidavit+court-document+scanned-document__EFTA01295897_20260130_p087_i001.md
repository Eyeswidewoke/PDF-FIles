748 F.2d 602, *; 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 15990, **; 
1984-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P66,311; 40 Fed. R. Serv. 2d (Callaghan) 954 
On November 22, 1977, Warner Brothers mailed out bid solicitations for "Superman," one 
of the most commercially important movies of the year. The bid solicitation stated that 
theatres exhibiting screen ads would not be considered eligible for licensing (**9] the new 
film. The clear intent was to discourage screen advertising programs. 
As a result of the major distributors' coercive activities, numerous theatre exhibitors 
withdrew from the NITE program; they could not afford to lose their principal sources of 
supply. At the same time, Cinemavision tried to separate itself from SAFFCO and NITE in 
order to save its business. These efforts came too late, and in 1978 Cinemavision went 
out of business. 
NITE, Patterson, and SAFFCO, invoking section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 
(1982), brought this private anti-trust action against the eight defendant film distributors we 
have referred to supra, alleging that they had conspired to destroy SAFFCO, in violation of 
sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2 (1982), because SAFFCO 
threatened to compete vigorously in their oligopolistic market. The plaintiffs alleged that 
the statements by the defendants' executives concerning the NITE Film Fund and the 
subsequent meeting of the MPAA Advertising-Publicity Committee evidenced this 
conspiracy and that Warner Brothers' and Twentieth Century Fox's threatened boycott of 
any exhibitor rloi who participated in the on-screen advertising program was in 
pursuance thereof. The conspirators knew, plaintiffs alleged, that the exhibitors would 
respond to such threats by refraining from on-screen advertising. 
After answering plaintiffs' complaint, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the 
ground that plaintiffs lacked standing to prosecute their antitrust claims. Following a period 
of discovery limited to the standing issue, the court granted the defendants' motions as to 
Patterson and NITE because they were not within the target area of the alleged antitrust 
violations. 
The parties subsequently engaged in extended discovery on the merits of SAFFCO's 
claims, and the defendants again moved for summary judgment. Before the court could 
hear argument on their motions, though, SAFFCO's attorneys withdrew from the case. 
SAFFCO obtained new counsel, but Patterson soon became dissatisfied with his 
performance and sought to represent SAFFCO himself. The court refused to permit him to 
do so, however. Patterson then tried another approach; he dissolved SAFFCO and moved 
the court to substitute him for the company as party plaintiff. The court denied his motion 
and proceeded rig to consider the defendants' motions for summary judgment. It 
concluded that the defendants' actions were not responsible for SAFFCO's alleged injury 
and consequently granted summary judgment for the defendants. 
SAFFCO and Patterson appeal. SAFFCO contends that the court erred in granting the 
distributors summary judgment because material facts remained unresolved. r607] 
Patterson contends that the court erred in concluding that he lacked standing to sue under 
the antitrust laws. Both appellants challenge the trial court's denial of Patterson's motion 
for substitution as party plaintiff and its disposition of several procedural and discovery 
matters. We discuss these points in order.
