785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
approximately 40 accounts of discrimination from particular individuals. Id. at 338. Given 
the class size of approximately 334 persons, there was roughly one anecdote for every 
eight members of the class. See id. at 331, 338; Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2556. "[T]he 
anecdotes came from individuals spread throughout the company who for the most part 
worked at the company's operational centers that employed the largest numbers of the 
class members." See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2556 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Similarly, this litigation includes anecdotal evidence from more than 16 individualv in a 
class that numbered approximately one-hundred "past and present black employees at the 
plant" at the time litigation commenced -- an approximate ratio of one anecdote for every 
6.25 class members.'' See Brown I, 576 F.3d at 151 (describing the class size). 
18 This number includes both the 16 declarations introduced by the workers and other r44) accounts of discrimination 
included in affidavits obtained by Nucor after the EEOC charge was filed. See. e.g.. J.A. 5992-95. 6143-45. 6174, 6369-70. 
6505-07. 7036. Of the 16 worker-filed declarations. Byron Turners statement fails to mention specific instances of promotions 
discrimination. but instead affirms that that he was "affected by the same practices that Ramon Roane and the other named 
plaintiffs" have raised. J.A 1124. The dissent argues that the declaration of Walter Cook also fails to mention promotions. Post 
at 134. Cook's declaration, however, states that he heard white employees talking about a black worker's application for an 
Operator position. According to Cook, the employees stated they would "do everything that they could to make sure that nigger 
didn't get the job." J.A. 1075. Further, the dissent argues that the declaration from Kemeth Hubbard includes a complaint that 
Nucor in tact promoted him. Post at 134. Hubbard's declaration, however. accuses Nucor of placing him "in the position to get 
(himl out of the mill and the line of progression that lead to supervisory positions." J.A 1097. Hubbard also observes that his 
trajectory at the company was dramatically different from that (""451 of a white co-worker who started at the plant at the same 
time and later became a supervisor. Id. Indeed, the dissent's approach to the affidavits, consistent with its approach to the 
anecdotal evidence throughout. appears to be to cherry pick facts from an 11.000 page record. strip those facts of context. and 
then argue that they undermine the substantial, credible evidence of discrimination that the workers have produced. 
19 There is some uncertainty about the precise size of the class. At the time the litigation began. seventy-one workers at the 
Nucor plant were black. Brown I. 576 F.3d at 151. As the district court found. there was a total of "ninety-folk black employees 
who worked at the plant from 2C01 through 2004." Id. at 152. The workers' experts estimated that there may have been about 
150 black workers in total who "were potentially affected by the selection decisions regarding promotion at Nucor-Berkeley." 
JA 1154. Even assuming a class size of 150, there would be more than one anecdotal account of racial discrimination for 
every 9.38 class members, a ratio that remains in line with the evidence in Teamsters. Furthermore, that number does not take 
into account the descriptions of discrimination in promotions (""461 decisions in the affidavits that Nucor itself obtained, as 
previously described. 
Balanced against such evidence, the district court gave "limited weight" to approximately 
80 affidavits from Nucor employees largely disclaiming discrimination at the plant -
affidavits taken by company lawyers after the EEOC charges had been filed. See J.A. 
10950-51. Common sense and prudence, however, instruct that the affidavits do little to 
rebut the evidence of discrimination insofar as they were given under potentially coercive 
circumstances, where the company reserved its ability to p9141 use them against other 
employees in any future lawsuit (a fact that was omitted from the Statement of 
Participation given to affiants). See J.A. 6003 (the Statement of Participation), 9379 
(Nucor's statement that it intended "to use the affidavits for every purpose permitted under 
the Federal Rules of Evidence," including the opposition to class certification and the 
impeachment of witnesses); see also Kleiner v. First Nat'l Bank of Atlanta, 751 F.2d 1193, 
1202 (11th Cir. 1985) (observing that after a class action has been filed, "[a] unilateral 
communications scheme . . . is rife with potential for coercion"); Quezada v. Schneider
