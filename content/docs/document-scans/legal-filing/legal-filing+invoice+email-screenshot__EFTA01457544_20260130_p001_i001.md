No surprises. but improvements et the margin 
While EOG's result largely stuck to the emerging script thus far amongst E&P 
reports 
(volume 
beat, 
lower 
costs, 
poor 
realizations), 
incremental 
improvements to both asset performance and cost structure continue to add to 
what has been peer-leading performance. Although guidance (cost and 
volume) remains unchanged for the year, capital is clearly under downward 
pressure (updated well costs are targeting 10% below 2015 plan assumptions), 
and well performance is exceeding expectations, further supporting the 
potential for attractive growth within cash flow in 2016. Buy. 
investment Thesis 
I Ct I ishr PT BUY 
EOG continues to expand its competitive advantage relative to peers from a 
dominant position in domestic oil assets. The company is delivering superior 
wells, while capturing more value from the wellhead via sustainably lower well 
costs and a leading position in crude logistics. 
What to look for on the call% 
• 
Capital Outlook: Although the FY15 budget remains unchanged, look for 
guidance on the potential for either a downward revision to FY budget or 
incremental activity in 2H15. Well costs are currently averaging 4.5% 
below 2015 plan assumptions, with confidence in updated targets of 10% 
average decline from FYI 5 plan, led by the Permian, with declines of 8%/ 
12%, captured/targeted. 
• 
Asset performance: High density completions in the Eagle Ford are 
tracking -23% ahead of prior (2014 vintage) completions, with the 2015 EF 
program shifting to 95% high density wells. Look for thoughts around 
potential for further incremental improvements from here, as well as the 
impact of high density completions in both the Bakken and Permian. 
• 
Decision Points for Growth: The key question around a pick-up in activity 
remains at what combination of price and service cost deflation would see 
EOG put rigs back to work The recent run-up in crude prices will likely 
trigger significant discussion on the roadmap for a pick-up in rig activity. 
With the strip near $65/bbl for 2016 and flat prices -$59/bbl, look for 
management to speak to a sooner than anticipated (early 3O) pick-up in 
well completions, as well as thoughts around whether operating cash flow 
will set the limit of incremental activity.

Valuation and Risks 
Our $101 PT is derived from an equal 
weighting between our NAV at LT 
prices of $80/$4.50 and a 9.0x target 
2016 DACF multiple. A downside risk 
includes operational missteps in the 
Eagle Ford, which will negatively 
affect growth projection.
