On the 12th August 2016 the new (UK) =nsurance Act came into force and we need to inform you of the 
following =hanges that we are highlighting to all of our clients. 
The Insurance Act =The Act) will apply to all new insurances, renewals and any changes to =nsurance 
requirements effective on or after the 12th August 2016. The Act =equires that a fair presentation of the risk is made as 
failure to do =o could result in avoidance of the policy and retention of the premium =if failure to make a fair 
presentation is deliberate or reckless), or =f different terms being adopted to consider how the risk would have =een 
underwritten had fair presentation been made, which could result in =nly partial payment of any relevant claim. As your 
Broker we have = key role in ensuring that you are aware of and comply with the updated =equirements. 
Insurance Law for contracts subject =o the laws of England & Wales has changed since your last renewal =nd, in 
order that you may comply with your obligations please be =dvised of the undernoted requirements, which differ to 
those previously =n place: 
Duty =f Disclosure 
You have a duty to make a fair =resentation of the risk to the insurer, via Sturge Taylor & Assoc, =f every 
material circumstance which you ( or a member of your =rganisation, employee, Captain, Crew, management team etc 
) =now or ought to know in relation to the risk placed and this duty is =pplicable before the cover is placed, when it is 
renewed and at any =ime throughout the contract if the risk changes. A circumstance =s material if it would influence 
the judgement of an Insurer / =einsurer in determining whether to take the risk and, if so, on what =erms. If you are in 
any doubt whether a circumstance is material =e recommend that it should be disclosed. 
Disclosure will be considered fair =f it is made in a manner that is reasonably clear and accessible and =he facts 
represented are correct and made in good faith. Failure =o disclose a material circumstance may entitle an insurer to 
impose =ifferent terms on your cover or proportionately reduce the amount of =ny claim payable. In the event that 
non-disclosure was deliberate =r reckless an insurer will be entitled to avoid the policy from =nception and retain the 
premium paid. This would result in any claims =nder the policy not being paid. 
Conditions Precedent 
You must also take =articular note of any conditions precedent that appear in the =olicy. If a condition 
precedent to the validity of this policy or =o the commencement of the risk is not complied with, the insurer will =ot 
come on risk. If a condition precedent to the Insurers =iability under this policy is not complied with, the insurer may 
not be =iable for the loss in question. A condition precedent may exist =n the policy using other terminology and 
without reference to the words =E244condition precedent'. 
It is very important that you read =he full policy carefully when it is received and, if you are unsure of, =r are 
unable to comply with any provisions therein, please let Sturge =aylor & Assoc know immediately. 
Contracting Out 
Some Insurers have exercised their right to opt out of the =equirements of the new act. In the event that this 
effects the =nsurances we have placed for you we will advise you accordingly. 
We have =roduced a simple guide to help you through some of the changes within =he Insurance Act which, if 
not attached to this email it is available =n request. If you would like further information please contact =s and we will 
endeavour to help.
