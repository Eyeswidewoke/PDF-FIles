character and contamination from the values of the tradi=g floor to the rest of a banking institution. Because these 
things cannot b= regulated, the probability is that politicians will focus on their politic=l proxies, especially pay. 
> The return of Vickers 
> The link between what has happened at Barclays and the universal banking a=gument is trust. Preserving the universal 
bank model relies on public trust=that the core retail functions of a bank and its trading activities can be properly and 
completely segregated. The UK Independent Commission on Banking=chaired by Sir John Vickers proposed in 2011 that 
they could be preserved i= a single institution but in separate entities, with the retail functions r=ngfenced with their 
own higher capital levels. The Vickers Commission recom=ended that all derivatives services should be kept outside this 
ringfence. 
> The UK government accepted the argument that retail banks should be able t= maintain some simple derivatives 
functions such as products for hedging cu=rency risk for business clients. The Barclays experience is already 
leading=politicians and commentators in the UK to argue that simple derivatives may=be an oxymoron. Trying to define 
them may be a futile exercise, and one tha= will inevitably be gamed by banks. 
> The UK government shows some reluctance to revisit its interpretation of t=e Vickers proposals. But if the British 
Parliamentary enquiry into the LIBO= issue now concludes that the government has erred on the side of trusting b=nks, 
then the pressure for an outcome closer to the original Vickers recom=endation, to be written into next year's Banking 
Act, will be inten=e. 
> The universal banking debate will take another serious twist if the new le=dership of Barclays ultimately decides to 
break the bank up into a retail b=nk and an investment bank and broker/dealer. As extreme as this sounds, 
the=intangible costs in political and regulatory animus Barclays now attracts c=uld suggest that a clean break makes 
sense. An arrangement that gave existi=g shareholders a stake in both new institutions might be acceptable. 
> Barclays would no doubt sell such a split as a smart commercial move. But t=e political and regulatory subtext would 
be to undermine the case that such=banking agglomerations are both necessary and useful. Although the French a=d 
German commitment to their own universal banking systems is very strong, s=ch a split would certainly empower critics 
of the universal banking model i= the EU and the US. The Liikanen Group inquiry is due to report to the Euro=ean 
Commission on bank structure later this year. The Commission itself is t=en expected to issue its own recommendations 
on bank structure. Both will c=rtainly draw on the Barclays experience. 
> The culture question 
> This bigger issue about the values of the trading floor is going to prove h=rd to shake off. The role of securities 
divisions in driving investment ban= profits over the last two decades has predictably seen a generation of sec=rities 
managers rise to the leadership of investment and universal banks. W=ile it is perhaps unwise to generalise too much, 
most of these men have bro=ght with them the directness and self-belief that comes with surviving a ca=eer on the 
trading floor. 
> They also bring with them a view of the market and of market-making that i= often at odds with the way most 
politicians understand them. Watching Lloy= Blankfein of Goldman Sachs trying to explain to the US Senate in 2010 why 
i= was legitimate for Goldman Sachs as a market maker to be both long and sho=t in the US property market at the same 
time reinforced the point. There is=a yawning gulf between a trader's pragmatic view of financial marke=s and a wider 
political and public audience who generally interpret the mar=et maker's pragmatism as cynicism, detachment and short 
termism, es=ecially when it results in making a lot of money. 
> Banks tend to be highly impatient with this public and political ambivalen=e. Most banks' response to efforts at greater 
regulation of securit=es markets have often been rooted in the argument that these markets are fu=damentally a forum 
for free trade between consenting adults and should be t=eated as such. It is this argument that the LIBOR-scandal, with 
its taint o= market fixing, and the persistent flow of suggestions of contempt for cust=mers and clients, does so much to 
undermine. 
> The events of the last two months have succeeded in cementing for good the=idea that the banking crisis of 2008 was 
ultimately the result of unethical= 'casino' behaviour on the trading floor. Whatever failings=banks might have exhibited 
in their ethical standards here, the reality is t=at the banking crisis had its roots in poor lending and risk standards, 
and=poor management of loan book funding, rather than wild gambles or duplicity=in the securities markets. The 
Vickers Commission explicitly recognised thi= by focusing on raising capital standards at the retail banks that make up 
t=e backbone of the British credit system. 
> Recent huge losses in the Chief Investment Office at J P Morgan and conduc= like that of Barclays' traders have made 
this distinction far too=subtle to insist upon politically. This may not matter much in regulatory t=rms — regulators have
