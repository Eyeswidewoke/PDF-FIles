demand of performance and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) without notice of 
its intention to sell or of time or place of sale or of redemption or other notice or demand 
whatsoever to Mortgagor, all of which are hereby expressly waived, and without 
advertisement, sell at public or private sale or othenvise realize upon, the whole or, from 
time to time, any part of the Mortgaged Property. If notice of any sale or other

designated by Lender or such other place as may be mutually agreed upon by Mortgagor 
and Lender. In addition, Mortgagor shall provide, without expense to Lender, storage 
facilities for such Mortgaged Property. At the request of Lender, Mortgagor shall 
promptly execute and deliver to Lender such instruments or other documents as Lender

designated by Lender, at such time or times and place or places as Lender may specify, to 
obtain possession of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property; 
(ii) 
Lender, either after entry or without entry, may proceed by suit or
