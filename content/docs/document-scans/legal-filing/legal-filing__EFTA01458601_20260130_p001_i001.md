Six market views from our Chief Investment Officer for Wealth Management in the 
Americas and Chief Investment Strategist for Deutsche AWM Americas 
Will equity-market investors have to learn to live with volatility? 
WS We still expect modestly rising equity markets but also 
be€ieve that volatility is here to stay- the events of the last few 
months have demonstrated how equity-market reversals can 
quickly erode year-to-date gains. Equity valuation multiples 
also tend to decline after the Fed rate hike and we think that 
valuations will gradually move back towards historical averages. 
So opportunities wi€l exist but investors will have to €earn to eve 
with some sharp upward and downward market moves. 
Are emerging markets likely to remain particularly vulnerable? 
n 
Emerging markets were expected to suffer in the run up to 
any Fed rate-hike decision and they have. But less expected was 
how tears about Chinese growth would spill over into a more 
general concern about the long-term health of emerging markets 
a concern compounded by the impact of low commodity 
prices on certain economies. The implication is that even if the 
future path of Fed policy becomes much clearer, emerging 
markets problems will not be resolved quickly and they will 
remain vulnerable to reversals. 
Will China's impact on developed equity markets vary? 
geal i he U.S. has the least exposure with an estimated 3% 
of profits of companies in the S&P 500 Index related to China.
Germany and Japan are more exposed, with around 20% of 
index profits linked to China. Here, some cut in eamings-per-
share estimates looks prudent in response to China's troubles. 
But all calculations as to the impact of various Chinese growth 
scenarios must be speculative as we cannot anticipate the 
second-round effects or the possible policy responses. 
Will core sovereign bonds always be a safe haven? 
Nothing should ever be taken for granted. Consider 
for example how there was only a small decline in German 
sovereign-bond yields earlier this year in response to a sharp 
equity-market correction. High measures of va€ue at risk (VaR) 
meant that switching into bonds did riot help portfolio managers 
reduce risk; they may also have been put off by negative yields. 
Other issues may also come into play in other sovereign-bond 
markets -for example, concerns over Chinese sales of U.S. 
Treasuries in an attempt to preserve the value of the Chinese 
Yuan. 
Are you still broadly positive on U.S. high yield? 
Global growth concerns and low oil prices have cast a 
shadow over U.S. high yield in 2015. In particular, parallels have 
been drawn to the telecoms defaults of 1998/99. But the two 
periods are not totally comparable. Energy has a €ess significant 
weight in the index now than telecoms did then. High volumes of 
new issues in recent years have also helped push out near-term 
maturities and have decreased current refinancing risks. This is 
certainly one to monitor, but we remain broadly positive on U.S. 
high-yield debt

Will the euro's role as a funding currency continue? 
Mal Over the last year, markets have realized that the ECB's 
long-term commitment to a very dovish monetary policy 
makes the euro an attractive funding currency. As a result, 
even increased market concerns over Greece earlier this year 
were supportive. With ECB quantitative easing (OE) expected 
to continue tor some time, the euro's role as a funding currency 
will continue. However, it is still not clear whether the euro 
would remain a genuine safe-haven currency through a period of 
deeper financial stress. The U.S dollar would probably reassert 
its historical safe-haven role, helped by the depth and liquidity of 
the U.S. Treasury market.
