Yes! This represents a shift from a depiction to some kind of =essentialist" mechanist world view. This essentialist 
thinking is =till alive today, even if the notion of the essence has changed. Searle =elieves that thinking is impossible 
without the "intrinsic properties =f biological neurons", Penrose wants the intrinsic properties of =uantum systems, and 
a lot of people seem to believe that minds are =hemical or biological or environment-interaction phenomena. The 
common =enominator of these positions is that we need to recreate the actual =akeup to produce the property 
(intelligence, mind, cognition). 
At the moment, the most fuitful position is probably functionalism, i.e. =he idea that the property is the result of the 
underlying functionality =with respect to that property), and that there is no essence. If we =ould replace all biological 
neurons with little machines that perform =xactly the same functions and interact with the rest of the body in the =ame 
way, the resulting mind would be unchanged. 
Contemporary functionalism, however, is mostly still built on a the =oundation of mechanism, in the form of materialist 
physicalism. We are =sking ourselves: what kind of mechanism is the mind? What are the =echanics of neurons? 
Epistemologically, I think that matter and mechanics cannot be primary. =11 we have is information (discernible 
differences at our systemic =oundaries), and our ideas of matter, or causal mechanics, are encodings =ver these patterns 
of information. Information is primary, the universe =s a pattern generator, minds are a class of systems that (in very 
=articular and distinct ways) identifies and manipulates structure in =hat information. "Computation" means, simply put: 
meddling with =nformation. Minds, in this computationalist perspective, are certain =ypes of information processing 
systems. (Ones that implement functions =or integrating, representing, interpreting, combining, anticipating... 
=nformation, and that have a motivational system to set goals that =irect these functions.) 
Most computer scientists are computationalists by instinct: to us, =verything is a computer program in some sense. 
(Physics, for instance, =s the endeavor to find a possible implementation that could produce all =nown observable 
phenomena.) Most other people on the planet, including =uite a few philosophers, are not. To them, the idea of
