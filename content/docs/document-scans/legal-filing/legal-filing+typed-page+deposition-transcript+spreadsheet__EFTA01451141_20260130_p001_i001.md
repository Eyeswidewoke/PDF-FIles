FX Blueprint Thin end of the wedge 
Theme #5: Dingo unchained 
▪ 
2013 saw the largest fall in AUD/NZD in over 28 
years. Behind the fall in the cross was a significant 
move in interest rate differentials. 
• 
With the cross near record lows we think the risk / 
reward from here favors AUD/NZD upside. As a 
result we would be long AUD/NZD at current levels. 
As shown in Figure 1, 2013 marked the Worst' year for 
the AUD/NZD cross since at least 1986. Interestingly, in 
prior years when the cross has fallen over 10% the 
subsequent year sees a significant bounce back. The 
13.5% fall in 1987 to 1.0959 was followed by a bounce 
of 23.5% in 1988; while the 12.7% fall in 2002 (to 
1.0727) saw a 6.7% bounce in the following year. With 
the cross ending 2013 at 1.0850 after a 14.0% decline, 
history would suggest some likelihood of a significant 
move higher in AUD/NZD over 2014. 
Of course there is much more to FX than history. From 
a more fundamental perspective we see a number of 
reasons to expect a move higher in the AUD/NZD cross 
through the course of 2014. 
The first is valuation. As Figure 2 shows, the AUD/NZD 
cross has traditionally found a base around 1.05 (with 
just below here therefore likely to serve as a good level 
to set any stop). Our valuation metrics (as published in 
Exchange Rate Perspectives) also find NW the most 
over-valued of the G10 currencies on a PPP and BEER 
basis. The NZD is around 33% 'expensive' on a PPP 
basis, versus the AUD which is 26% 'expensive'. On a 
BEER basis the NZD is 22% 'expensive', versus the 
AUD which is only 5% above 'fair-value'. 
As far as 'big picture' drivers of the AUD/NZD cross are 
concerned, it is hard to go past interest rate 
differentials as shown in Figure 3. Looking a little more 
closely at the last few data points in that chart it also 
appears that AUD/NZD has 'overshot' interest rate 
differentials to the downside. 
Indeed, the current 
interest rate differential would appear to be more 
consistent with the cross trading around 1.13 versus its 
current level. 
We should not, of course, rule out 
interest rate differentials 'catching up' to the cross. 
That would require, however, markets to price even 
more tightening for the RBNZ, and/or easing from the 
RBA. 
On the outlook for the kiwi central bank our central 
view remains that we will see 75bps of policy 
tightening over the course of 2014. Market pricing is a 
little more aggressive than that, with a little over 
100bps of hikes priced for 2014. On the RBA the 
market is essentially priced for no change in rates in 
Australia over the coming year - something consistent
