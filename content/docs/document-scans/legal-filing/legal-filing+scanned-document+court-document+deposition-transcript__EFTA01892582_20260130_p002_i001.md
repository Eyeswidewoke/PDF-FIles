the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit from Hamas. Thus, he is a known quantity to his 
Israeli counterparts and his appointment would appear to bode well for a level of trust in the lines 
of communication on the most sensitive security issues. 
Libya: The death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans during violent attacks 
against American facilities in Benghazi on September 11th has generated strong responses from 
the Libyan people and government. On Friday, September 21n, in actions reminiscent of the 2011 
Arab Spring, thousands of Libyans took to the streets in Benghazi and overwhelmed the camp of 
the militant Islamic group, Ansar al-Sharia (Supporters of Islamic Law), perceived to be the 
perpetrators of the crime. The protesters later took over a camp of another militia group and 
invited the police to assume responsibilities for the two sites. Two militias in the city Dana 
voluntarily dissolved themselves. The Libyan government subsequently demanded militias not 
cooperating with the Ministry of Defense to dismantle their camps and surrender to the state. 
Two dynamics arc worth highlighting here. First, Libya is witnessing a multiplicity of political 
forces (old regime diehards, new liberals, Islamic fundamentalists, Islamic extremists, groups of 
ethnic or regional affiliation) competing for power politically. Secondly, the recent series of 
events — circulation of the online anti-Islamic video, violent street protests, the West's consistent 
defense of free speech, and the subsequent publishing of caricatures of the Prophet Mohamed in a 
French newspaper — reinforces the cultural divide between the Islamic world and the West. The 
Islamic world perceives the West as having nothing but contempt for Islam and cannot understand 
the West's commitment to free speech when it attacks the divine. The West is perceived as 
irrationally inflexible on this issue. In turn, the West sees the Islamic world as intolerant and 
violent. This divide serves to reinforce the extremes on both sides of the issue. Salafists (the 
Islamic fundamentalists), in particular, are major beneficiaries. 
Tunisia: Protests in Tunis directed at the US Embassy and American school over the anti-Islamic 
online video resulted in the deaths of two Tunisians on September 1O'. In response, the Tunisian 
Ministry of Interior banned demonstrations on Friday, September 21g, out of fear of further 
extremist violence. The government's concern had increased following a French newspaper's 
publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohamed. After being suppressed for years by the Ben 
Ali regime, Salafists are challenging the state and appear intent on reversing the rights secured by 
Tunisian women. The Salafists' relations with the ruling Islamist party Ennanda are a roller 
coaster ride circling between cooperation and animosity. Some Salafists reject party politics and 
are working under the banner of Ansar al-Sharia (Supporters of Islamic Law — same name but 
distinct from the Libyan group). The Tunisian group is not calling for jihad at this time, but sees 
the country as ripe for proselytizing. Having rejected party politics and opposed the recent 
Tunisian elections, the group regards the elected assembly as an infidel organ. To them, legislating 
is solely the provenance of the almighty. In a recently released press statement, the leader of 
Ennanda, described the Salafists as a threat to society and said he expected the government and 
security forces to protect public order. Highlighting widespread concern in Tunisia regarding the
