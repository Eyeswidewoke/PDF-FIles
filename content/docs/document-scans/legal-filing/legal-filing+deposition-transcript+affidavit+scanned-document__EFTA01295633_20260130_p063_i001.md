785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea;

assumption. The district court noted that, at the time of decertification, Plaintiffs still had 
not produced the relevant forms. So, it had "never seen the 27 change-of-status forms 
upon which [Plaintiffs'] experts apparently relied." J.A. 10943. Thus, the district court cited 
the Brown I dissent only to emphasize the potential problems inherent in using the forms 
and why it needed to see them. See J.A. 10942-43. The majority's protracted discussion of 
the Brown I dissent therefore does nothing to rehabilitate Plaintiffs' evidence, resting as it 
does on a twofold misreading of the Brown I dissent and the district court's decertification 
decision. 
Nor does the majority explain why inflated black bidding rates can be excused. Rather than 
address that obstacle, the majority assures the reader that the problem causes only "an 
incremental reduction in probative value" that does ['•111] not "fatally undermine the 
probativeness of the experts' findings." Maj. op. at 23. But it is hard to minimize these 
defects so quickly when Plaintiffs' experts offered few explanations for their assumptions 
or any assessment of the expected impact of those assumptions. The experts did not say, 
for instance, whether black bidding rates varied during the years for which data was 
available. If they had shown that the rates remained steady, then one might assume that 
those same rates applied to the extrapolated years. But if the rates varied, then Plaintiffs' 
experts' assumptions are not sustainable. Oddly, the majority again blames Nucor for not 
summoning any evidence going to variation, but that tack once more reverses the burden 
of proof. "It is the plaintiffs' burden to demonstrate compliance with Rule 23," not Nucor's. 
EQT Prod. , 764 F.3d at 358. The majority further finds that Plaintiffs' experts reasonably 
assumed that "every" position was posted for bidding. But Plaintiffs themselves submitted 
testimony identifying several unposted positions. See, e.g., J.A. 1010, 1051, 1091, 1110. 
Nucor's stated policies also indicated that, at least for a time, "[v]acant supervisory 
positions [were] not [to] be posted for bidding." r"112] J.A. 257. 
r940) The majority stresses that, as a general matter, plaintiffs may employ extrapolated 
data to prove discrimination. Maj. op. at 18-19. That can be true in some cases, but 
extrapolated data must still be statistically valid. And the majority ignores a significant and 
telling distinction between this case and past ones: Plaintiffs' experts extrapolated two data 
points — the composition of the applicant pool and the success rates -whereas experts in 
our prior cases only extrapolated one data point. See Lewis, 773 F.2d at 568; United 
States v. Cnty. of Fairfax, Va., 629 F.2d 932, 940 (4th Cir. 1980). 
The majority's cited cases also involved defendants who wrongfully destroyed relevant 
evidence. See Lewis, 773 F.2d at 568 (noting that the defendant "improperly disposed" of 
applicant records); Cnty. of Fairfax, 629 F.2d at 936 n.4 (noting that the defendant 
destroyed applicant data "[i] n violation of the record keeping regulations of [two statutes]"). 
In a situation involving spoliation of evidence, the Court commonly draws adverse 
inferences against the spoliators. But this record contains no evidence of spoliation. 
Regardless, no authority requires the district court to find extrapolated data convincing in 
every case. Our precedent holds just the opposite. In Allen v. Prince George's County, 737 
F.2d 1299, 1306 (4th Cir. 1984), for example, the district court relied solely upon actual 
applicant flow r.1131 data "to the exclusion of all [other] statistical evidence," including 
evidence crafted from alternative benchmarks. We affirmed, emphasizing that we could not 
"second-guess" a fact-bound decision concerning "the relative weights to be accorded to
