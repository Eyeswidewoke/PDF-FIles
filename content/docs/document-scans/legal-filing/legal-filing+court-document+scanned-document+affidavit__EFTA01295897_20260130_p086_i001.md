enrolled independent exhibitors representing four thousand screens to display 
advertisements, two thousand of whom agreed to contribute their advertising revenues to 
SAFFCO. 
On September 27-28, 1977, at a NITE regional meeting held in St. Louis, Cinemavision 
announced that the screen advertising program would be launched in late October with a 
one thousand theatre test run. A reporter from Daily Variety ("6] attended the meeting 
and filed a long story entitled "NITE's Screen Advertising Network Gets 1000-Theatre Test 
Run Beginning Oct. 24," which appeared on the front page of the September 29 edition. 
The story stated, in part: 
Folowing the tryout, additional theatres in other markets will be added until all 4200 screens signed up for the program 
are unreeling soft•sell commercials. William Woosley of Cinemavision told NITE's national conference of small circuits 
and independent buyers. 
Included in that number. per NITE prexy Tom Patterson. are 2000 screens (not al NITE members) which will be 
donating proceeds from the ads to the Screen Advertising Film Fund Corp. (SAFIFICO), the NITE group established to 
purchase. finance and produce features. 
All exhibitors signed by Patterson have agreed to put three minutes of advertising on their screens before showing the 
feature for four years. Over that period. Patterson estimated. $42,000,000 would be generated for SAFIFICO from the 
2000 subscnbing screens. 
A second Daily Variety reporter in Hollywood, California placed phone calls to the major 
motion picture distributors to obtain their response to the NITE r7] film advertising 
program. Senior executives from Universal Pictures, Buena Vista, Twentieth Century Fox, 
Columbia, and Warner Brothers returned the reporters calls. All the executives were 
familiar with the program. They all voiced strong opposition to NITE's program because 
they feared the advertisements would "clutter the screen" and alienate theatre patrons. 
The executives' responses were quoted in the September 29, September 30, and October 
5, 1977 editions of Daily Variety. 
The MPAA Advertising-Publicity Committee met on October 27, 1977 and discussed the 
NITE Film Fund. Richard Kahn, chairman of the committee and vice president of Metro-
Goldwyn Mayer, told a Daily Variety reporter that the committee unanimously voted to take 
a stand urging theatres not to exhibit screen ads. A story on the cover of the November 4, 
1977 edition of Daily Variety reported that 
A new voice — that of the ad-pub committee of the Motion Picture Association of America — has been added to the 
campaign to dissuade theatre owners from participating in the screen advertising program through which the National 
Independent Theatre Exhibitors Association (6063 hopes to generate rotti financing for new feature film product. 
Richard Kahn, ad-pub-exploitation v.p. of MGM, chairman of the MPAA panel. yesterday disclosed a unanimously 
approved committee stand deploring the "rebirth" of screen advertising, and urging exhibitors "to keep their screens 
free of nonentertainment oriented clutter." 
Action of the ad•pub committee was endorsed by MPAA president Jack Valenti. and the associations advertising chief. 
Bethlyn Hand. Both attended the session, along with representatives of Universal. United Mists. Warner Bros. and 
MGM. Nonmember observers from American International and First Mists concurred. 
On October 31, 1977, Twentieth Century Fox issued a statement that it would require all 
future exhibitors of its films to pay it a percentage of any revenues they might derive from 
on-screen advertising. The purpose of this statement was to discourage theatre 
participation in screen advertising programs.
