2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
estimate, a reasonable percentage-of-recovery fee in this case would be between 
$1,900,000 and $13,500,000. The fee award sought by counsel and the lodestars 
calculated under Defendants' proposed New York-Philadelphia mean and fourth-quartile 
billing rates all fall within this range. 
For the second factor, the Court incorporates its Girsh analysis of Class member 
objections and notes that no Class members have objected to the proposed Class Counsel 
award. This factor weighs in p81] favor of fee approval. The Court also finds that the third 
and fourth, and sixth Gunter factors weigh in favor of approving a fee award within the 
ranges sought by Plaintiffs and Defendants. As discussed, Class Counsel spent 5,100 
hours over three years litigating this case, survived a motion to dismiss, and obtained a fair 
and reasonable settlement in a complex, multi-state consumer class action involving 
uncertain legal issues. The fifth Gunter factor 
risk of nonpayment — weighs in favor of 
approving the award sought by Plaintiffs because Class Counsel undertook this case on a 
contingency basis and accepted the potential risk of non-payment. ECF No. 86 at 20-21. 
Finally, with regard to the sixth Gunter factor, the $2,230,000 award sought by Plaintiffs 
and Defendants' proposed lodestar calculations are similar to awards approved in similar 
cases. See, e.g, Henderson v. Volvo Cars of N. Am., LLC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46291, 
2013 WL 1192479, at *13 (D.N.J. Mar. 22, 2013) (approving award of $3,000,000 in 
attorneys' fees in class action providing class members with reimbursements and warranty 
extensions in connection with alleged defects in automobile transmission systems); 
O'Keefe v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, 214 F.R.D. 266, 304 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (approving 
award of $4,896,783 in attorneys' fees in class action involving allegedly defective rear lift-
gate hatch in p821 automobiles). 
4. The expenses sought by Plaintiffs are reasonable 
In further support of their petition for a $2,320,000 award, Plaintiffs submit that Class 
Counsel incurred a total of $133,358.30 in expenses. ECF No. 86 at 2.to "Counsel for a 
class action is entitled to reimbursement of expenses that were adequately documented 
and reasonably and appropriately incurred in the prosecution of the class action." In re 
Safety Components Intl, Inc., 166 F. Supp. 2d 72, 108 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing Abrams v. 
Lightolier, Inc., 50 F.3d 1204, 1225 (3d Cir. 1995)). Courts have held that photocopying 
expenses, telephone and facsimile charges, postage, and expert witness fees are all 
reasonably incurred in the prosecution of a large litigation. See id. (citing cases). 
10 Again. Plaintiffs indicate that this amount has increased by $15549.32 since the filing of their motion for attorneys' fees and 
costs. see ECF No. 105 at 1. but the Court will perform its analysis using the 5133.358.30 number in the original motion. 
Plaintiffs submit expense reports through the Class Counsel declarations, breaking 
expenses down into categories such as "Filing/Misc. Fees," "Mediation Fees," "Postage," 
"Photocoyping," "Expert Fees," and "Transportation/Meals/Lodging." See, e.g., ECF No. 
86-2 ¶ 11, Ex. 2 (Cafferty Globes Meriwether & Sprengel, LLP Expense Report r83] 
through March 21, 2016). Some firms provide itemized lists of individual expenses. See, 
e.g, ECF No. 86-3 Ex. 2 (Markun Zusman Frenier & Compton, LLP "Pre-bill" for Tom 
Monreal). Although Defendants challenge the level of detail provided by Plaintiffs and the
