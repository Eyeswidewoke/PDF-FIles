He worked at Bear Steams early in his career and then formed his own firm, 3. Epstein & Co. In 2008, Epstein was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for 
prostitution, for which he served 13 months in prison. He lives in the US Virgin Islands. Epstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School in Manhattan from 
1973 to 1975. Among his students was a son of Alan C. Greenberg, chairman of Bear Steams. 
In 1976, Epstein started work as an options trader at Bear Steams where he worked in the special products division, advising high-net-worth clients on tax strategies. 
Proving successful in his financial career, in 1980 Epstein became a partner at Bear Stearns. 
In 1982, Epstein founded his own financial management firm, J. Epstein & Co., managing the assets of clients with more than SI billion in net worth. In 1987, Leslie 
Wexner, founder and chairman of Ohio-based The limited chain of women's clothing stores, became a well-known client. Wexner acquired Abercrombie & Fitch the 
following year. In 1992 he converted a private school on the Upper East Side into an enormous residence. Epstein later bought that property, in the wealthiest part of 
Manhattan. In 1996, Epstein changed the name of his firm to the Financial Trust Company and, for tax advantages, based it on the island of St. Thomas in the U.S. 
Virgn Islands. 
In 2003, Epstein bid to acquire New York magazine. Other bidders were advertising executive Donny Deutsch, investor Nelson Pelt, meda mogul and publisher 
Mortimer Zuckerman, who had the New York Daily News, and film producer Harvey Weinstein. They were ultimately outbid by Bruce Wasserstein, a longtime Wall 
Street investor, who paid $55 million. 
In 2004, Epstein and Zuckerman committed up to 325 million to finance Radar a celebrity and pop culture magazine founded by Meer Roston. Epstein and
