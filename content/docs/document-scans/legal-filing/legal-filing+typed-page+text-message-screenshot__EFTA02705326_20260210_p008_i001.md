FILTER CONTROLS 
Most speakers are not designed to reproduce 
the full range of frequencies audible by the human 
ear. For this reason, most speaker systems are 
comprised of multiple speakers, each dedicated 
to reproducing a specific frequency range. Filters 
are used to select which frequency range is sent 
to each section of a speaker system. The division 
of frequency ranges to different speakers can be 
done with passive filters (coils and/or capacitors 
between the amplifier outputs and the speakers). 
which are acceptable and commonly used 
for filtering between mid-range speakers and 
tweeters. Filtering between subwoofer systems 
and satellite speaker systems is best done with 
active filters, which cut off frequency content at 
the input to the amplifier. Active filters are more 
stable than passive filters and do not introduce 
extraneous resistance, which can degrade 
subwoofer performance. 
The active low-pass filter built into 
the XD600/1 is designed to attenuate 
frequencies above its filter frequency, 
so that the system's subwoofers do not 
reproduce any audible midrange content. 
This serves to improve tonal balance 
and to avoid distortion. Correct use 
of the filter can substantially improve 
the fidelity of your audio system.

2) LP Filter Operation: The low•pass filter in the 
XD600/I is fully variable between 50 Hz and 
500 Hz via the "Filter Freq: control knob and 
features the ability to select between a moderate 
"l2dB" per octave or a steep "24dB" per octave 
slope via the "LP Filter Mode/Slope" switch. 
Depending on the subwoofer system and 
the vehicle, different slopes may be required 
to produce a smooth transition to the mid-
bass speakers in the system. Experiment to 
find the slope which best matches the acoustic 
requirements of your system. 
Tuning Hint: A trunk mounted sub whose 
output has to "fight" through a rear deck or a 
back seat often benefits from the 12 dB/octave 
slope which lets more upper bass content pass 
through. A sub that fires directly into the 
listening environment is more likely to benefit 
from a 24 dB/octave slope. 
Note: The above hint is not "set-in-stone"... 
You should always listen to the system carefully to 
determine the best choice as vehicle acoustics and 
other factors play a big role in choosing the most 
appropriate filter slope. 
3) Precise Frequency Selection: The filter 
frequency markings on the front panel of 
the amplifier are for reference purposes and 
are generally accurate to within 1/3 octave 
or better. If you would like to select the filter 
frequency with a higher level of precision, 
consult Appendix B (page 13) of this manual. 
This chart gives you a more accurate frequency 
for each of the forty detented positions of the 
frequency selection control. This method can 
be very useful if the amplifier is mounted in 
a location where you can't see the front panel 
markings easily. 
4) Defeating the LP Filter: The Low-Pass filter 
can also be defeated completely, by switching 
the "LP Filter Mode/Slope" switch to the 
"Off" position. This is useful if you are using 
an external active crossover in the system. 
With the internal crossover turned off, the 
XD600/l's upper frequency response limit is 
500 Hz, due to its subwoofer-specific design.
