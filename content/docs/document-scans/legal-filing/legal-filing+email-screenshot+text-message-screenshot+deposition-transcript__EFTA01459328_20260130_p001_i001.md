risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes Because 
hedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that 
is more or less than expected, or it may result in a loss. A portion of the profits, if any, realized in hedging our obligations under the 
notes may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers. and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging 
profits. See "Selected Risk Considerations — JPMS's Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price (Price 
to Public) of the Notes` in this pricing supplement 
Secondary Market Prices of the Notes 
For information about factors that will impact any secondary market prices of the notes. see 'Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the 
Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many 
economic and market factors' in the accompanying product supplement. In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs 
included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by 
JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. These costs can include projected hedging profits, if 
any, and. in some circumstances, estimated hedging costs and our secondary market credit spreads for structured debt issuances. 
This initial predetermined time period is intended to be the shorter of six months and one-half of the stated term of the notes. The 
length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a profit in connection with our 
hedging activities. the estimated costs of hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as determined by JPMS. See 
"Selected Risk Considerations — The Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be Reflected on Customer Account 
Statements) May Be Higher Than JPMS's Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time Period' 
Supplemental Use of Proceeds 
The notes are offered to meet investor demand for products that reflect the risk-return profile and market exposure provided by the 
notes. See "Hypothetical Payout Profile" and 'How the Notes Work" in this pricing supplement for an illustration of the risk-return profile 
of the notes and 'The index' in this pricing supplement for a description of the market exposure provided by the notes. 
The original issue price of the notes is equal to JPMS's estimated value of the notes plus the selling commissions paid to JPMS and 
other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, plus (minus) the projected profits (losses) that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks 
inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes, plus the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.
