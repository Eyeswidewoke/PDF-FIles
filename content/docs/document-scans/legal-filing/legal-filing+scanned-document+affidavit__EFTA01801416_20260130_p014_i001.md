<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24424552> , leaving the floor wide open fo= president Xi Jinping to assert 
China's regional leadership ("the Asia-Pacific cannot prosper without China <http://www.straitstimes.com/b=eaking-
news/se-asia/story/apec-2013-xi-says-china-and-asia-can-only-prospe=-working-together-20131> "). 
A more direct taste=of foreign news is available just a few clicks away. On my cable TV contro=, if I scroll down to 
channel number 73, or 355, or whatever it is, I can =et Al-Jazeera, China's CCTV and Russia's RT. Their reporters often 
speak perfect American-accented journalese, and =ometimes actually are career American journalists, lured away from 
job-she=ding US news organisations to give credibility to these channels. CCTV's W=shington bureau chief, for instance, 
is Jim Spellman, formerly of CNN. These channels' take on the Washington d=E9gringolade is much harder edged than 
the ESPN version. The website of th= Russian state-backed RT quotes an editorial published by the Chinese stat= news 
agency, Xinhua <http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/> , proposing that, in the light of this crisis, "several cornerston=s 
should be laid to underpin a de-Americanised world". 
Of course these cha=nels are representative of their undemocratic states, not their peoples. A=d you may ask, well, who 
on earth watches CCTV or RT? Does anyone take the= seriously? In Europe and North America the answers are still "not 
many" and "not very". (That=is somewhat less true of Al-Jazeera.) But in Africa, Latin America and par=s of Asia, it's 
already a different story. In the global competition of in=ernational broadcasting, these well-funded networks are 
gaining influence. 
It's not just in th= arena of soft power that perceptions are also realities. As George Soros 
<http://www.georgesoros.com> keeps pointing out, that's true of financial markets. Just as a reminde=: the US hit its 
debt limit of $16.699 trillion in May this year. (For comparison: the World Bank estimates its 2=12 GDP at $15.685tn.) 
Since May, the federal government has been using so-=alled extraordinary measures to pay its bills and refinance its 
debt. 
These measures are =hat treasury secretary Jack Lew said <=pan style="font-size:18.0pt">would reach the end 
<http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013.10-10/politics/42=78760_1_debt-ceiling-debt-limit-full-faith-and-credit> of 
their tether on October 17. A few days ago he told the Senate treasury committee that rate= on short-term treasury 
bonds had almost tripled in a single seven-day per=od. And last week Fidelity, the largest American money market 
mutual fund =anager, sold all its short-dated US government bonds. Just a temporary precaution, you understand. But if 
t=e US goes on like this, then one day — one year, one decade — the copp=r bottom of investors' confidence will fall out. 
Even the hardest fo=m of hard power, military action, involves a significant element of percep=ion. Vietnam has just said 
farewell to its war hero, General Vo N=uyen Giap <http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/general-vo-
n=uyen-giap> , credited with drivi=g both France and the US out of his country. As obituaries pointed out, his Tet 
offensive of 1968 was a military failur=, since the Viet Cong were thrown back with huge losses. But politically, =t played 
a key role in turning American public opinion against the war. Si=ilarly, there is no purely objective truth about the wars 
in Afghanistan and Iraq, but in the view of=a large part of the world, the US military did not exactly win. 
At the time of writ=ng, it looks as if the rutting stags in the Senate and House of Representa=ives will step back from the 
canyon's edge at the last minute. But even if=they do, huge damage has already been done. Politically, in the eyes of the 
world, the "full faith and cred=t" of the US has been further eroded. 
Americans need to s=e those views from outside. Some understand this need: that's one reason s= many visit the US 
version of the Guardian's website. It's also a service =he digital International New York Times (formerly International 
Herald Tribune) may help provide, with a wider ran=e of international voices — although its target audience is modestly 
des=ribed by the responsible assistant managing editor, in a New York Times pi=ce about itself, as "the political, business
