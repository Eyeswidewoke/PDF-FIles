Foundation has been funded with appreciated stocks and these positions h=ve been liquidated. There are 1648 
shares of United Rentals that are=restricted. RD is sending paperwork to LDB to sign today to clean these sh=res up. 
Once the paperwork is provided to broker and they release the restriction (move the shares to=type 2 account) then 
transfer to Foundation will begin. There are a =ouple of loss positions worth < $3K that need to be sold. RD is to 
prov=de shares and ticker to EA today so that clearance/ compliance apporval can begin. I'd like to have the a=counting 
group be invilved in this to gain familiarity with the Apollo com=liance process. There is a worthless position that JPM 
will pu=chase for $1 to take off their books (Scienta is the name of the company - no longer on pink sheets or OTC BB) 
RD has pap=rwork for this for LDB to sign today. 
401k - call with specialist yesterday with EA/RJ. To not hav= Julie be part of 401k, the thought is to begin plan 
Dec 1. Compensa=ion would be one month and any employer contribution would be minimal give= any contribution 
would be for rank and file on one month comp. Given that highly compensated is de=ined by prior year compensation, 
FU and RD are not highly comped in 2013 a=d will help cure any low participation by rank and file for 2014 plan year= 
(Plan year is calender year) Top heavy rules should not be applicable given that RJ and EA are only key employees=and 
Ac/RD are not, ie the key employee contributions will not exceed 60% o= total plan contributions a/o 12/31/2014. For 
2015, the =01k specialist is running numbers based on our census to see if we will have any issue either on the 
discrimination rules=or the top heavy rules. Specialist indicated that matching can be ma=e only for non-highly 
compensated and not fr highly compensation, For 2015= HG will not be highly compensated apparently as her stub 
comp is less than $115K. The more non-highly comped that=participate, the better. 401k specialist is running some 
scenarios a=d costs under different matiching scenarios and will revert tomorrow (Tues=ay is Ambrose holiday) 
Art list has been provided to LDB. Gating question is what is cost=benefit of retaining more than 2x collateral -
step up benefit of art reta=ned in estate vs lesser value of art partnership leaving an unpaid note in=hands of AP01 (with 
a zero basis), ie capital gain by trust at death. This was the gist =f the meeting with LOB /HG/FU late Oct. HG has 
confirmed we can expa=d colateral list to 200+ names and go down the value scale to $200K per it=m. LDB OK with this. 
This was discussed in FO team meeting two weeks ago.
