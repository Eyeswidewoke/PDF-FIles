Richardson Center, WWF & African Parks Leveraging Technology & Training To Protect African Wildlife I Press Releases I WWF 
10/17116, 2:49 PM 
fire with fire. Our collective know-how and resources will bring cutting-edge, affordable and readily-replicable critical help 
to this unprecedented crisis and push the envelope in the fight against wildlife crime. We're sending a very clear message 
to poachers: your time is short. We're closing in on your deplorable slaughter of innocent wildlife." 
The Richardson Center and WWF are teaming up to explore various anti-poaching and wildlife monitoring technologies 
and ranger engagement initiatives on pilot bases for broader application in wildlife conservation. For example, specialized 
sensors, wildlife GPS tagging, aerial camera and thermal imaging systems and other visual notifications can be deployed 
in at-risk environments to provide real-time reconnaissance about illegal activities in protected areas. Over the coming 
months, these efforts will be evaluated and tailored for a variety of settings. 
"Wildlife poaching is at a crisis level in Africa," said Leon Lemprecht, African Parks' manager of Odzala-Kokoua National 
Park in the Republic of Congo. "We still have a long way to go, but efforts like the poacher amnesty program and 
collaboration around technology are important steps in the right direction." 
Technology alone will not safeguard wildlife, Gov. Richardson said. The governor, who just released a new book, How to 
Sweet Talk a Shark, about navigating high-stakes international diplomacy, will leverage the Center's record to strengthen 
other protection and enforcement efforts, including: 
Prosecution of poaching as a 'wildlife crime' to allow seizure of poaching assets that can be redirected to wildlife 
conservation 
Federal and State asset forfeiture laws in the U.S. and international treaties allow seized assets, including cash and bank 
accounts, generated from drug trafficking, money laundering and other illegal activities to be forfeited. Funds raised are 
often invested right back into enforcement operations. 
Establishing elephant poaching as a 'wildlife crime' allows a similar opportunity for wildlife conservation. The 
Richardson Center is developing an Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering legislative action guide for countries to adopt 
to combat wildlife crimes. Led by Gov. Richardson, the pioneering law reform effort would empower African heads of state 
and their wildlife conservation agencies to enact model forfeiture laws, then enforce them through advanced education for 
law enforcement and legal personnel at a planned law reform institute. 
Establishment of a permanent 'poacher-to-protector' training academy 
Working in partnership with African Parks, the Richardson Center supported the launch of a poacher-to-protector amnesty 
and ranger training program in Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of Congo, in 2012. Since that time, there have 
been a record number of amnesty settlements and 56 weapons have been recovered. Fifty-six former poachers were 
accepted into the ranger training program and—after rigorous screening-43 successfully completed training and were 
given jobs as eco-guards or eco-monitors in the national park. 
The Richardson Center also announced today that it is providing funds for a first-of-its kind, permanent ranger school in 
Odzala-Kokoua National Park. Developed in partnership with African Parks, the training facility will support the expansion 
of the successful -poacher-to-protector" program. It will improve instruction, provide enhanced infrastructure — such as 
obstacle courses — and supply necessary equipment, including uniforms, shoes, backpacks, camping equipment and 
weapons. The training facility also plans to share best practices with international partners. 
One added advantage of the program is how former poachers can support broader enforcement efforts. For example, the 
testimonies of former poachers helped bring to justice a regional poaching kingpin, Ngondjo Ghislain, also known as 
"Pepito." Active in Odzala-Kokoua National Park, he was known for bribing corrupt officials. He provided them with 
firearms and ammunition in return for a portion of the profits of all the ivory sold by poachers in the region. After his arrest 
and trial, Pepito was sentenced to five years in prison, the toughest penalty in Congo for poaching.
