As you are aware, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and indicted in federal court on July 8, 
2019 on sex trafficking charges involving the exploitation and abuse of dozens of underage 
girls.' In the aftermath of these charges, Apollo hired law firm Dechert LLP to conduct an 
investigation into Epstein's ties to Black, Apollo's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the 
time. Mr. Black for decades maintained longstanding personal and professional ties to Epstein 
and engaged Mr. Epstein for his advice related to tax strategy, estate planning and philanthropy. 
The investigation, according to a filing published by Apollo with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission on January 22, 2021 ("the report"), identified several tax matters where 
Black paid Epstein $158 million for his advice.' According to the report, Epstein advised Black 
on tax strategy for complex transactions and trusts designed to avoid paying as much as $2 
billion in taxes.' This includes advice related to a "proprietary" solution Epstein developed for 
Black to resolve issues with a trust Black created in 2006 in order to transfer assets to his 
beneficiaries while avoiding roughly $1 billion in gift and estate taxes.' According to the report, 
Epstein also advised Black on a "step-up-basis transaction" designed to save Black's children 
approximately $600 million in taxes as well as other tax planning and compliance issues, 
including responding to audit inquiries from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).s
As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has oversight jurisdiction of matters 
pertaining to federal taxation, I seek more information related to the extraordinary compensation 
Black paid Epstein for a so-called "proprietary" tax avoidance solution Epstein developed for 
Black. Despite not being a certified public accountant or licensed tax attorney, it appears that 
Epstein was paid an amount that far exceeded what Black paid other professional advisors, 
including some of the most high-priced legal counsel in the nation.' In light of Epstein's role in a 
sprawling human trafficking scheme, it is important to understand why Epstein's compensation 
arrangement was substantially different than that typically afforded to professional advisors 
involved in trust, estate and tax planning. Accordingly, please provide answers to the following 
questions no later than July 9, 2022: 
1. Has Apollo retained all documents related to the memorandum titled "Investigation Of 
Epstein/Black Relationship And Any Relationship Between Epstein and Apollo Global 
Management, Inc." prepared by Dechert LLP for the Apollo Conflicts Committee? If not, 
what individual or entity currently has custody of those documents? Has Apollo

Id. at pg. 3: "As a result of Epstein's work, Black believed, and witnesses generally agreed, that Epstein provided 
advice that conferred more than $1 billion and as much as $2 billion or more in value to Black." 
7 Id. at pg. 10: "Epstein approached Black with his solution — which Epstein asserted was proprietary — and Black 
agreed to pay Epstein to implement this solution. Outside legal counsel described the solution as a 'grand slam' and 
one that met all of Black's financial and estate planning goals." 
Id. 
Id. at pg. 17: "It is clear that the compensation paid by Black to Epstein far exceeded any amounts Black paid to 
his other professional advisors."
