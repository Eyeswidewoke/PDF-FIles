EM Currency Handbook 2018: Still Fuel in the Tank 
Indonesia 
During the 1990s, Indonesia operated a heavily 
managed FX regime - essentially a fixed conversion 
rate with pre-announced intervention bands (initially 
+1-0.25%) in a framework for creeping depreciation. 
But being too slow to move the market rate up, Bank 
Indonesia was forced to widen its intervention bands 
6 times between January 1994 and September 1996. 
Then, as the Asian Financial Crisis took hold, and a 
further widening in July 1997 failed to stabilize the 
currency, IDR was allowed to float freely on August 14. 
The spot market spiked to 17,000, from 2,500. 
After the Asian Crisis - and under the supervision of an 
IMF program till 2003 - authorities sought to use FX 
policy - via higher interest rates, regulations over 
market access, direct intervention and moral suasion -
to dampen market volatility and encourage a stronger 
rupiah. Today, the BI website notes prominently: "Bank 
Indonesia has one single overarching objective: to 
establish and maintain rupiah stability" 
In the early 2000s and after the 2008 crisis, a stable to 
stronger rupiah contributed to lower inflation and 
reduced external debt servicing costs, while strong 
capital inflows and a stable current account allowed BI 
to fully repay IMF debt and build international reserves 
However, things began to change in 2011 as the 
current account deteriorated and capital financing 
became more erratic. Illiquidity and multi-tiered FX 
prices were often a concern. Intervention led to 
significant drawdown in reserves over 2013 during the 
taper-tantrum. Market stress prompted authorities to 
tighten monetary and fiscal policy, and make efforts to 
improve FX liquidity. 
In the past few years, responsible macroeconomic 
policy-making from inflation management, fiscal 
prudence, reform focus, reserve rebuilding, improved 
price discovery and transparency appears to have paid 
off. A number of regulatory changes have also taken 
effect from the mandatory use of rupiah for domestic 
transaction to hedging requirements on private non-
bank external debt in 2015, While exposure to offshore 
debt holdings is still among the highest in the region, 
the IDR spot market depth has improved, the current 
account deficit has moderated and become more 
sustainable, external debt has peaked, and reserves 
coverage looks more comfortable. From 2017 onwards, 
BI appears to have adopted a more apparent volatility 
management strategy for the rupiah, accumulating 
significant amount of reserves to keep the currency 
near fair value, and preventing large swings in FX. 
The rupiah is convertible on the current account: while 
not open on the capital account, policies have 
accommodated increased FDI and portfolio flows.
