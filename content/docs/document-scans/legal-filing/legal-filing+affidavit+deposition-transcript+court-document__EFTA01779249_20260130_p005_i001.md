(bj Not =11 Fukushima facilities use uranium rods. Some rely on MOx fuel (a blend o= plutonium, natural uranium, 
reprocessed uranium, or depleted uranium). Ou= understanding is that MOx fuel has a lower melting point; there is less 
experimental experience with it; and th=t it may be less sensitive to boron as a reaction moderator. Plutonium is 
=heaper to use due to the surplus of decommissioned weapons.
