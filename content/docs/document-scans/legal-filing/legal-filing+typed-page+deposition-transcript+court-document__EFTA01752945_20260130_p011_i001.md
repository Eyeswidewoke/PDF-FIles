that brought Hamas to power in the Gaza Strip =n June 2007. Moreover, Tamarod accuses Hamas of sabotaging all 
attempts to reach reconciliation between the rival Pales=inian factions, of holding responsibility for the suffering of the 
people =f the Gaza Strip, and of prioritizing its own political survival over the =eneral needs of the Palestinian people. 
Some Tamarod Gaza activists are operating from Egypt, where they have suppo=t among local political parties opposed 
to the Muslim Brotherhood, sympath= from much of the Cairo-based media, and tacit approval from the current 
a=thorities. Such support reflects the widespread anti-Hamas sentiment in the country following the sacking o= 
President Morsi and frequent accusations that Hamas was providing clandes=ine assistance to terrorists in the Sinai and 
violent Muslim Brotherhood p=otests in other provinces. Notable among the relatively few activists' names to have been 
made public are Haz=m al-Surani, who belongs to an important Gaza clan, Hatem al-Fara, the mem=er of an important 
Khan Yunis clan, Ahmed al-Afghani, and lyad Abu Ruk. So=e of these individuals have held public meetings in Daqhalia 
and other parts of Egypt sponsored by local po=iticians. 
Hamas, for its part, has privately been taking the challenge seriously, des=ite belittling it publicly. Hamas interior 
minister Fathi Hamad, for examp=e, who is responsible for internal security, has threatened on several occ=sions to 
respond to any demonstrations in Gaza with the utmost force. Media outlets have quoted Hamad, in a close= meeting of 
the organization's top leadership, as saying that he wants &qu=t;people shot in the head, not injured." The same reports 
claim that =eteran Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar quickly intervened to clarify that Hamad did not mean literally 
shooting people bu= rather "prevention of the return of chaos to the streets of Gaza.&qu=t; Whatever the authenticity 
of such exchanges, which cannot be verified, = few preventive arrests in Gaza have occurred in the past few weeks, and 
other suspected Tamarod sympathizers have been =luntly warned not to take any chances. One was shot in both legs 
and evacu=ted to an Israeli hospital. 
Furthermore, in view of the threat, Hamas has shifted overall responsibilit= for the stability of the Gaza Strip from its 
internal security apparatus =nder Muhammad Dababish to the movement's military branch, the Izz al-Din a=-Qassam 
Brigades, now effectively commanded by Yahya al-Sanwar and the elusive Muhammad Deif. After a long i=prisonment, 
Sanwar was released from an Israeli jail last year as part of =he deal to free Israeli corporal Gilad Shalit. Thus, the military 
arm of H=mas will oversee Gaza's squares come November 11. The Qassam cadres are expected to patrol the streets 
ins=ead of the local police. 
Needless to say, the Palestinian Authority (PA) and others in Fatah are kee=ing busy in an effort to stir up trouble for 
Hamas. PA chairman Mahmoud Ab=as and his lieutenants are well aware of the current crisis in Hamas (see =olicyWatch 
2111; http://washin.st/12CUnw0 <http://washin.st/12CUnw0> ) and the growing discontent among the Gaza populace. 
The un=erlying causes of this unhappiness include the closing down of most tunnels connecting Rafah to the Sinai, the 
drying=up of financial support from Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and other sources,=and the bitter struggle within Hamas's 
top echelons. These developments ha=e, in turn, led to continuous electricity cuts, fuel shortages, lack of cement and 
building materials, and delayed p=yment of salaries to public sector employees. Reflecting the undoubted res=ntment 
toward Hamas rule in Gaza, one poll -- of course, to be interpreted=very cautiously -- shows that no less than 48 percent 
of Gazans now support a "revolution" there,=as compared with 37 percent in 2012. And, according to the latest 
figures,=unemployment in the Gaza Strip may reach 43 percent by the end of this yea= -- mainly among the young who 
have reached working age. 
Low-Profile Support From High-Profile Figures 
Three main players in Fatah are involved in quiet efforts to encourage =azans to take to the streets against Hamas. 
The first is Azzam al-Ahmed, a member of Fatah's Central Committee, who was=the movement's point man in the failed 
negotiations over reconciliation wi=h llamas over the past four years. Ahmed is seeking to help remaining 
Fatah=members in the Gaza Strip regroup for action. This effort, however, has been hampered by endless disputes an= 
splits within the different Fatah factions in Gaza, which are all under c=ose Hamas supervision. The "Source of Authority 
Committee" of Fa=ah in the Strip, led by the aging Zakaria al-Agha, has been deterred from mounting any open 
opposition to Hamas. So =ar, Fatah has been unable to agree unanimously on a new leadership to run =ts affairs in Gaza. 
The second effort is led by PA director of General Intelligence Gen. Majid =araj, who is trying to mobilize support for an 
anti-Hamas upheaval. His ef=ort is mainly a response to the activities of Hamas's "West Bank Coun=il," which, from 
Gaza, seeks to reestablish the movement's political and military structures in the West Bank. It shou=d be noted that 
some Tamarod Gaza spokesmen have been identified as inhabi=ants of the West Bank. 
The third effort is managed by Muhammad Dahlan, the ex-strongman in the Gaz= Strip who fell out with Abbas and now 
operates from Dubai with the full s=pport of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Zayed al-Nahyan. While engaging in 
veno=ous attacks against the PA, mainly centering on corruption and unnecessary concessions to Israel, Dahlan is k=en
