Section 9: Cede., Legal. ERISA and Tax Considerations 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opponundies Fund IV, LP 
"private fund limited partnership-. The Fund Partnership Agreement will be governed by English law and all parties to the 
agreement will irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any 
disputes which may arise out of or in connection with the Fund Partnership Agreement and the documents to be entered 
into pursuant to it. 
Investors will offer to subscribe for Interests pursuant to a deed of adherence governed by the laws of England and 
Wales and all parties to the deed of adherence will irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales have non-
exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with the deed of adherence. 
Investors whose offers to subscribe for Interests are accepted by the General Partner and the Manager will become 
limited partners in an English private fund limited partnership and will become party to the Fund Partnership Agreement 
constituting the Fund. Investors' interests in the Fund will be as limited partners and will not be certificated but will be 
recorded on the register of limited partners maintained by the Fund. Investors will have no opportunity to control the day-
to-day operations of the Fund, including investment and disposition decisions. 
A judgment of a non-English court will create an obligation that is actionable in England. To enforce that obligation, an 
Investor would need to commence proceedings in the courts of England, in which the judgment is sued upon as a debt. 
For a foreign judgment to be recognized by the English courts it must, inter ells. be final and conclusive in the court 
which pronounced it, it must have been given by a court regarded by English law as competent to do so, its recognition 
must not be contrary to public policy, and it must not have been obtained by fraud.

The maximum level of leverage to be employed by the Ftnd, calculated in accordance with the "commitment method' 
(article 8 of the Delegated Regulation) shall be: 300%.
