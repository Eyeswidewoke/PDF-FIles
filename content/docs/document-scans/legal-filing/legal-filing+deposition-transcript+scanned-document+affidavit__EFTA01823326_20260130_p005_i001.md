foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of excitement. 
We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie 
Sheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He is now 
the highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of "Two and a Half Men." 
Oliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the 
camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines 
challenging their concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, "Action" as the extras aggressively jockey for face 
time. Charlie is not having an easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pficffer has gotten 
his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and my marriage has become a threesome. 
Sensing ow concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to scat a dinner 
table with Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck PfietTer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He 
directs us to chat with each other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. 
Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli 
Wallach and Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who throws 
himself in front of a train early in the film. Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles. who 
reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. 
Lunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including 
Susan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, 
country houses and vacations. 
Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. 
Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein. in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza. watches from 
a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86•yearold father, Tulley Rector. 
Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed 
like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes. 
The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 
p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalie Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists 
uptown. 
Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the 
shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, 'We must do lunch". Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises 
Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. 
tracking shot continues for numerous 
takes following Josh and Noelle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings. 
At last, "It's a wrap" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, "a day of 
electrifying glamour? and "the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours." 
November 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting 
Donald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from
