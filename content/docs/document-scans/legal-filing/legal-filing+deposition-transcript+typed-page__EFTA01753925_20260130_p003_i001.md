has been re=eatedly attacked by Iran's hard-liners, who are uninterested in a deal.&=bsp; But Rouhani has persevered, 
suggesting that this deal is important to him. He has twice said publicly that h= needs the deal soon — in one instance, 
he argued for three to six month= — because if he cannot demonstrate quickly to Iran's supreme leader, =yatollah Ali 
Khamenei, and his hard-line rivals that he can secure meaningful compromises from the West, they will use his=failure 
to curtail his room for further maneuver. 
In fact, it's curio=s that Rouhani chose to make resolving the nuclear impasse his first major=policy move. Most 
politicians would have chosen to start by tackling small=r, domestic problems related to Iran's economy or political 
system as a way of racking up some quick wins to bols=er their political position before turning to a major foreign policy 
gambi=. 
Moreover, this one =s focused on a foreign policy problem that has proven utterly intractable =or years; represents a 
core difference with Iran's powerful hard-line fa=tion; requires a deal that the supreme leader himself may oppose; and 
relies on Iran's repeatedly proclaimed gr=atest adversary to do the right thing for the Islamic Republic. In ma=y ways, it 
is a gamble of monumental proportions, which again should reinf=rce both our sense that Rouhani is serious about 
getting a deal and the notion that he is probably ready to make sign=ficant compromises to get it. But it also gives 
credence to Rouhani's ow= warning that he needs this deal soon, or else his presidency could be cri=pled by its failure. 
On our side, the ev=dence of the past few years gives reason to reassess our assumptions about=Iran's nuclear strategy. 
Of greatest importance, Iran has been deliberat=ly refraining from pursuing a nuclear weapon as quickly as it could have. 
At first, many feared that once =ran began large-scale enrichment activities, it would simply enrich enough=uranium for 
one bomb to weapons grade (90% purity or better) and then deto=ate a crude bomb. Iran achieved that capability in 
about 2008, yet they did not break out. Then, the fear=was that once the Iranians accumulated enough low-enriched 
uranium (3.5% p=rity) for one bomb they would immediately enrich that to weapons grade and=break out. Iran passed 
that benchmark in about 2010, and again they did not do so. 
Next, the fear was =hat once Iran had acquired enough uranium enriched to 19.75% purity (somet=mes called "medium-
enriched uranium") for one bomb it would immediatel= convert that to weapons grade and break out. Iran passed that 
benchmark in 2012, and again, it chose not do =o. In fact, instead, Iran has regularly converted some of its "medi=m-
enriched uranium" to plates for the Tehran Research Reactor (which mak= them difficult to further enrich for weapons), 
and it has done so to ensure that it has less than a bomb's worth of med=um-enriched uranium on hand at any time. 
This behavior is im=ortant because it demonstrates that whatever Iran does ultimately intend f=r its nuclear program —
and there should be no doubt that its current nurlear program is a military program meant to produce weapons, not a 
civilian program meant to produce electricity =97 Tehran has consciously decided not to break out and race for an 
arsenal=and has held to that policy for at least five years. Israel's form=r chief of military intelligence, Amos Yadlin, and 
Israeli nuclear expert Yoel Guzansky have called attention to this imp=rtant pattern, noting that "Iran is not advancing 
toward the bomb at as =apid a pace as it could. It appears to realize that such progress would br=ng with it negative 
strategic repercussions." 
Just why Iran has c=osen not to go ahead and weaponize remains a mystery, but there are at lea=t four powerful factors 
that, taken together, probably have convinced Tehr=n not to do so for now. These include the threat of an Israeli or 
(more likely) American military attack; fear t=at the United States would greatly ramp up its covert action and 
cyberwarf=re campaigns against Iran if it decided to weaponize; fear that the Saudis=would obtain nuclear weapons of 
their own if Iran did; and, of greatest importance to my mind, fear that t=e Chinese and Indians would join the Western 
sanctions against Iran becaus= Beijing and New Delhi have made it clear to Tehran that while they do not=support a war 
against Iran, they are dead-set against an Iranian nuclear arsenal. 
What's important =bout these factors is that all remain firmly in place. If they have =een adequate to dissuade Iran from 
exercising its breakout capability for =he past five years, it is likely that they will continue to do so for some time to 
come. Indeed, in spring 2013= both President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Ben=amin Netanyahu publicly 
stated that it would take Iran a year or more=to field a workable nuclear weapon from a decision to do so (a decision
