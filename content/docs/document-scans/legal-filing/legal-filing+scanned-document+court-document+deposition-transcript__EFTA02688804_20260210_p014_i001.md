Similarly, we should expect that the dynamics of systems near nodes may be revealing of the underlying dynamics which 
replaces quantum theory for individual systems. 
More generally, the new distinction we have introduced between microscopic and macroscopic suggests an exploration for a 
new regime of mesosccopic physics: those systems which are likely to come in a small numbers of copies in the universe. The 
study of such systems should reveal evidence for the underlying laws that quantum mechanics approximates. 
This proposal also implicitly addresses speculation by some theoretical cosmologists that the universe comes in an infinite 
number of copies which contain many exact and inexact copies of the Earth and each one of usil 1 Within the present proposal. 
the fact that macroscopic bodies do not appear to satisfy the superposition principle can be taken as evidence that the universe 
is finite so that we and other macroscopic bodies have no copies. On the other hand, testing the limits of the applicability of 
quantum mechanics to mesoscopic systems like quantum circuits may make it possible to do local measurements which could 
determine whether thcrc arc any copies of them in the universe. 
A number of queries and issues can be raised concerning this proposal, some of which were discussed above. These need to 
be better understood before the proposal made here can be considered to be in final form.

I am grateful to Julian Barbour. Saint Clair Cemin. Cohl Furey, Lucien Hardy. Adrian Kent. Jaron Lanier. Michael Neilsen. 
Carlo Rovelli, Rob Spekkens and Antony Valentin' for comments, suggestions on drafts of this paper, and encouragement. I 
would like to thank also Antony Valentini for the chance to present this work at the New Frontiers in Quantum Foundations, 
CUPI 2011 conference and also thank the participants for valuable comments. This direction of thought was inspired by work 
in progress with Roberto Mangabeira Unger on the implications of the hypothesis that there is only one universe which must be 
explanatorily closed. Research at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics is supported in pan by the Government of Canada 
through NSERC and by the Province of Ontario through MRI.
