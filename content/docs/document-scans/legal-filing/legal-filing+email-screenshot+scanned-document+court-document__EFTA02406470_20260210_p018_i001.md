"The essential skills will be those of rapidly searching, browsing, =ssessing quality, and synthesizing the vast 
quantities of information," =rote Jonathan Grudin, principal researcher at Microsoft. "In contrast, =he ability to read one 
thing and think hard about it for hours will not be=of no consequence, but it will be of far less consequence for most 
people.=94

Some argued that technology is not the issue as much as bedrock human =ehavior is. The "moral panic" over 
digital technology "seems to be w=red into us,"—it parallels previous concerns about media that have not led to the 
downfall of civilization, noted Christopher J.=Ferguson, a professor from Texas A&M whose research specialty is 
t=chnologies' effects on human behavior.

Reform of the education system is necessary to help learners know how =o maximize the best and minimize the 
worst. Reform could start by recogniz=ng that distractions of all kinds are the norm now. Educators should teach the 
management of multiple information streams, emp=asizing the skills of filtering, analyzing, and synthesizing information. 
=Iso of value is an appreciation for silence, focused contemplation, and =93lessons in ignoring people," as futurist 
Marcel Bullinga put it.

Others noted research that challenges t=e idea that people can be "multitaskers." People really toggle 
between=tasks and "time slice" their attention into ever-smaller chunks of tim=, argued Nikki Reynolds, director of 
instructional technology services at Ham=lton College. 
Futurist John Smart= president and founder of the Acceleration Studies Foundation, recalled an=insight of economist 
Simon Kuznets about evolution of technology effects k=own as the Kuznets curve: "First-generation tech usually causes 
'net negative' social effects; second-generation =91net neutral' effects; by the third generation of tech—once the tech 
=s smart enough, and we've got the interface right, and it begins to reinfo=ce the best behaviors—we finally get to 'net 
positive' effects," he noted. "We'll be early into conversational in=erface and agent technologies by 2020, so kids will 
begin to be seriously =ntelligently augmented by the internet. There will be many persistent draw=acks however [so the 
effect at this point will be net neutral]. The biggest problem from a personal-development pers=ective will be motivating 
people to work to be more self-actualized, produ=tive, and civic than their parents were. They'll be more willing than 
ever=to relax and remain distracted by entertainments amid accelerating technical productivity. 
"As machine intel=igence advances," Smart explained, "the first response of humans is to=offload their intelligence and 
motivation to the machines. That's a dehuma=izing, first-generation response. Only the later, third-generation 
educational systems will correct for this." 
Another comprehensi=e insight came from Barry Chudakov, a Florida-based consultant and a resea=ch fellow in the 
McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the Universi=y of Toronto. He wrote that by 2020, "Technology will be 
so seamlessly integrated into our lives that it will=effectively disappear. The line between self and technology is thin 
today =by then it will effectively vanish. We will think with, think into, and th=nk through our smart tools but their 
presence and reach into our lives will be less visible. Youth will assume =heir minds and intentions are extended by 
technology, while tracking techn=logies will seek further incursions into behavioral monitoring and choice =anipulation. 
Children will assume this is the way the world works. The cognitive challenge children and yout= will face (as we are 
beginning to face now) is integrity, the state of be=ng whole and undivided. There will be a premium on the skill of 
maintainin= presence, of mindfulness, of awareness in the face of persistent and pervasive tool extensions and 
incursions int= our lives. Is this my intention, or is the tool inciting me to feel and t=ink this way? That question, more 
than multitasking or brain atrophy due t= accessing collective intelligence via the internet, will be the challenge of the 
future."
