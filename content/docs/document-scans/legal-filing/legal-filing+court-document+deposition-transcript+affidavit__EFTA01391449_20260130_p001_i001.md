laws, including state securities or blue sky laws. Interests will be offered and sold without registration in reliance upon 
the exemption for transactions not involving a public offering contained in the Securities Act and/or Regulation 0 or 
Regulation S promulgated thereunder and generally will be sold in the U.S. only to U.S. Investors who are accredited 
investors, as defined in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

acquiring an Interest for its own account, for investment and not with a view to resale or distribution. Further, each 
Investor must be prepared to bear the risk of an investment in the Interests for an indefinite period of time, since the 
Interests may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Securities Act and any applicable state or non-

"In September 2008. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC ('CSSU') reached an agreement with the 
New York State Attorney General's Office and the North American Securities Administrators 
Association Task Force to settle investigations concerning investment products generally known as 
'auction rate securities.' Pursuant to that agreement and with CSSU's consent. a number of state 
securities regulators issued final orders against CSSU for engaging in dishonest or unethical conduct 
related to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities and failure to supervise reasonably. Under 
the terms of the settlement agreement, CSSU agreed to repurchase up to 5550 million of auction rate 
securities held by certain investors and pay civil penalties of 515 million. Under the settlement

District of Colurnbia allegations that they failed to supervise and/or engaged in dishonest or unethical 
practices (or substantially equivalent non-fraud based terms under relevant state statutes) related to 
the sale of auction rate securities. The basis of the allegations was that Raymond James offered and 
sold to some of their customers auction rate securities while not accurately characterizing or while 
failing to adequately disclose the true nature and risks associated with these investments. Although 
Raymond James' auction rate securities trade confirmations disclosed the risk that auction rate 
securities auctions could fail and that Raymond James were not obliged to ensure their success, at the 
point-of-sale, some of Raymond James' financial advisers inaccurately described auction rate 
securities. As a condition of the settlement, Raymond James offered to purchase eligible auction rate 
securities from eligible customers and to pay fines. Raymond James have completed all undertakings 
required under the settlement orders. Under the settlement orders. Raymond James neither admit nor 
deny wrongdoing:
