The most likely scenario is that the regime will fight to the bitter end, t= the last bullet and drop of blood. 
This leads to two questions: when Assad realises that he will fall, will he=then try to drag with him as many enemies as 
he can? And: what will a post=Assad Syria look like? 
An acute worry has risen from reliable intelligence reports that he has arm=d up to forty warheads of Scud missiles with 
a variety of chemical weapons= The question is whether he is seriously contemplating using them as a las= resort against 
his own people or launching them against his enemies in ne=ghbouring countries. His repeated utterings of "putting the 
region into fl=mes from the Mediterranean to the Caspian" if he is touched does not to ma=y ring as hollow as before. 
This could have possible detrimental consequen=es to Kazakhstan's oil and gas interests in the Caspian. 
The opposition and the rebels are so diverse and split that a likely scenar=o for the post-Assad era with high likelihood 
will produce a second civil =ar. The geostratigic importance of Syria can not be underestimated. The lo=s of Syria for Iran 
will consitute a major blow to it's aspirations of bec=ming a hegemonic regional power, and it will fight for new allies in 
Syria=to keep it's grip on the country. The west and the Gulf countries will hav= to do the same for their allies. The fact 
that different countries of the=Block are backing different groups are also complicating matters for a pos= regime 
situation. 
In conclusion: Syria will for years to come be unruly and a centre for the =eostratigic struggle of the region. 
Above all this looms Iran's ambition to be the regional hegemon. It's nucle=r ambitions underpin the worries of the west, 
Israel and the Gulf states. =n the current Israeli leadership there is a strong belief that Iran is hel=-bent on acquiring a 
nuclear capacity, and that negotiations are only thea=rics playing to the gallery. The Israeli leadership believes they have 
the=military capacity to strike effectively, and are countering objections tha= it will only delay the program by pointing 
to the fact that both Iraq and=Syria abandoned their programs after Israeli strikes. 
However the composition of the Israeli cabinet after January election might=change the outlook on these matters. The 
role of Zipi Livni, Lieberman (w=o is fighting an indictment), and Ehud Barak (who is not running for the K=esset, but 
might be asked by the PM to fill a prominent position related t= both the Iranian and Palestinian issues) will be critical. 
Vis a vis Iran some are of the opinion that the president would be willing =o strike the Iranian facilities if negotiations 
fail. However the question=of who will fill the posts of State and Defence might influence such a dec=sion. Both front 
runners for these positions are considered dovish on the =ssue. 
In the broader context of the region, unpredictability is the order of the =ay. Tunisia and Egypt seems to be roughly split 
in two with regimes leanin= to conservative Islam on one side and moderate, secular and liberals on t=e other. In Egypt, 
who's geostratigic importance is undisputed, the new co=stitution gives worrying signals of new authoritarianism which 
will give n=w impetus to solidify and unify the opposition. 
Yemen is equally unpredictable. Jordan and Kuwait are shaky and face uncert=inty. Bahrain seems slowly to cope 
adequately with its issues. Lebanon is =haking under the spill-over of the conflict in Syria, brought to a peak th=ough the 
assassination of its intelligence chief as well as street battles=in Tripoli. The Palestinian issue will be frozen until after 
Israeli elect=ons and the formation of a new cabinet, although the Europeans, and predom=nantly France, are working 
on new initiatives to be launched after the ele=tions. 
In Saudi Arabia two younger and forceful figures have taken the reigns of b=th the intelligence agency and the powerful 
Ministry of the Interior. The =ountry is again playing a major role in the region, particularly in the Sy=ian theatre. 
However the succession issue will be of paramount importance =or the long term of the country. 
Overall conclusion in a nutshell: uncertainty is the only certainty for the=region. And importantly: these are the only 
conflicts on the planet which =re not only of a local and regional character - they have serious implicat=ons for global 
security. A major new war in the Middle East will shake the=very financial and political foundation of world order.
