FX Blueprint: Dashing Buck 
Theme la Swiss Cheese Pounded 
• 
Swiss investors have significant underweights in 
foreign assets and "safe havens" globally are 
turning. Sell CHF vs USD and EUR. 
• 
The GBP bear story is not over, in our view: basic 
balance dynamics remain explosive, Carney will 
stay dovish and market positioning is cleaner. Sell 
GBP vs USD and EUR. 
Don't Underestimate Swiss Investor 
The market has been very focused on "safe-haven" 
inflows into Switzerland in recent years. While these 
have been big, the bigger story is the lack of outflows. 
Up to 2008. bond and equity flows by Swiss investors 
had been running at a 50bn CHF annual pace, mostly 
recycling savings from Switzerland's large current 
account surplus. The main destination has been US 
and European assets, accounting for more than two 
thirds of Swiss net foreign assets. This abruptly ended 
after Lehman: the Eurozone crisis, narrow rate 
differentials, CHF strength and very volatile equity 
markets all played their part. On all these fronts, we 
think things are changing however. Eurozone risk 
premia have been unwound to pre-2010 levels. Risk-
adjusted equity returns are booming. The Swiss franc 
has stabilized at extremely overvalued levels, and both 
European and US yields have likely bottomed. We 
therefore see conditions ripe for a return of the Swiss 
investor to international capital markets, and believe 
this will be a major driver behind Swiss franc weakness. 
All Other Safe Havens Have Turned 
Aside from domestic-led portfolio outflows, we don't 
think the signals from the unwind of other "safe 
haven" trades can be underestimated. Of all the "tail 
risk" trades, we see gold as holding the most similar 
properties to the Swiss franc: zero yielding, but 
perceived to hold value at times of stress. With the 
economy entering an environment of asset price 
inflation but goods price deflation, gold has proved a 
poor hedge, and we think the same holds for the Swiss 
franc. Indeed, medium-term trends between the two 
are similar, and combined with the huge decline in 
Eurozone risk premia, we see the risks as skewed 
towards an unwind of the more than 150bn of safe-
haven inflow that went into Switzerland over 2010-12. 
CHF Should Participate in Dollar Turn 
Finally, USD/CHF historically turns to lag turns in the 
dollar cycle. Back in the 1990s, it turned together with 
USD/JPY and USD/DEM. With our confidence on the 
dollar outlook building and no change from the SNB on 
the back of a very benign inflation outlook, we see 
conditions as ripe for a breakout in both USD/CHF and 
EUR/CHF targeting 1.00 and 1.27 respectively over the 
rest of the year. 
It's Not the Inflows. But the Swiss Outflows That 
Matter
