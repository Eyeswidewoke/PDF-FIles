on a motion in limine absent a clear abuse of discretion." Beehn v. Eppard, 321 III. App. 3d 
677, 680, 747 N.E.2d 1010, 254 III. Dec. 598 (2001), citing People v. Williams, 188 III. 2d 
365, 369, 721 N.E.2d 539, 242 III. Dec. 260 (1999). "However, a trial court must exercise 
its discretion within the bounds of the law." Beehn, 321 III. App. 3d at 680. [HN2] Where a 
trial court's exercise of discretion relies on an erroneous conclusion of law, as the Swentos 
claim, our review is de novo. Beehn, 321 III. App. 3d at 680-01. 
2. Modifications to the Lease 
The Swentos argue that the circuit court erred by granting the r6071 motion in limine and 
finding as a matter of law that the Agreement was not material enough to discharge the 
Swentos' obligations as guarantors of the lease. 
[HN3] In Illinois, the general principle applies that "a guarantor is not released unless the 
essentials of the original contract have been changed and the performance required of the 
principal is materially different from that first contemplated." Roels v. Drew Industries, Inc., 
240 III. App. 3d 578, 581, 608 N.E.2d 411, 181 III. Dec. 338 (1992). "Unless there is some 
material change in the business dealings between the debtor and the creditor-guarantee 
and some increase in the risk undertaken by the guarantor, the obligation of the [".15] 
guarantor is not discharged."' Roels, 240 III. App. 3d at 582, quoting Essex International, 
Inc. v. Clamage, 440 F.2d 547, 550 (7th Cir. 1971). 
[HN4] "Whether a guarantor is exposed to an increase in the risk it originally undertook is 
a key variable in determining whether there has been a material change in the guaranty 
agreement." Roels, 240 III. App. 3d at 582; Zirp-Bumham, LLC v. E. Terrell Associates, 
Inc., 356 III. App. 3d 590, 606, 826 N.E.2d 430, 292 III. Dec. 289 (2005). [FIN5] "A 
guarantor takes a risk in exchange for a benefit: when events beyond the guarantor's 
control dramatically increase the risk, the assumptions upon which the contract was 
founded are undercut." Roels, 240 III. App. 3d at 582. "The principle that a substantial 
increase in risk discharges the guaranty rests on the assumption that guarantors would not 
ordinarily ("137] tolerate a substituted increase in risk without seeking something in 
return." Roels, 240 III. App. 3d at 582. 
Here, the Swentos assert that several clauses in the Agreement exposed them to an 
increase in the risk that they originally undertook under the lease. These clauses include: 
(1) section 19.01, which was amended to provide that notices to the tenant would be sent 
to its office in Massachusetts ["*16] rather than the office of its predecessor in Houston; 
(2) section 19.23, which required the tenant to provide, upon request, an estoppel 
certificate stating that the lease is still in effect, that rent is paid to a certain date or 
describing any defaults, that the tenant occupies the leased space, and that the tenant has 
no claims against the landlord; (3) section 19.24, which required tenant and its parent 
company to provide financial statements to the landlord upon the landlord's written 
request; (4) section 19.25, which provided that the parties agreed that all actions arising in 
connection with the lease shall be determined in the state and federal courts of Illinois and 
the parties also agreed to waive their right to a jury trial; (5) paragraph 8, in which the 
tenant agreed that "the Lease is valid, and in full force and effect without default by 
Landlord, and that Tenant does not have any defense, claim or offset right against 
Landlord as of the date hereof ['6O8] Except as otherwise modified by this Agreement,
