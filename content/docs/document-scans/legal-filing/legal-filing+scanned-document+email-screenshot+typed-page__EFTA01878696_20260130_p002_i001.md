England had made Barclays' relationship with its regulator potentially toxic. 
Mr Diamond's departure and the LIBOR fixing scandal will mark the start of a new 
phase in the politics of the banking crisis in Britain. The suggestion that traders at 
Barclays and other banks were manipulating what is ultimately a key public benchmark 
for pricing financial products compounds a run of mis•selling and tax planning 
controversies. With a Parliamentary enquiry now to take place on the LIBOR issue in 
the UK, and the issue likely to ripple across other jurisdictions and produce both 
litigation and possible prosecutions, banks in the UK are confronted with new levels of 
political and public disdain. The fact that the Bank of England's own conduct remains 
subject to question in some aspects of the LIBOR scandal will not deflect from this. 
It is safe to assume that the setting of LIBOR will now be moved into the remit of the 
UK financial regulator. Brussels will tighten market abuse rules to apply criminal 
sanctions to tampering with indices like LIBOR. But the most significant political and 
regulatory outcome from these events will be to renew the debate about universal 
banking. Where this debate has to this point focused on scale, implicit subsidy and 
systemic risk, it will now focus on culture, personal character and contamination from 
the values of the trading floor to the rest of a banking institution. Because these 
things cannot be regulated, the probability is that politicians will focus on their 
political proxies, especially pay. 
The return of Vickers 
The link between what has happened at Barclays and the universal banking argument is 
trust. Preserving the universal bank model relies on public trust that the core retail 
functions of a bank and its trading activities can be properly and completely segregated. 
The UK Independent Commission on Banking chaired by Sir John Vickers proposed in 
2011 that they could be preserved in a single institution but in separate entities, with 
the retail functions ringfenced with their own higher capital levels. The Vickers 
Commission recommended that all derivatives services should be kept outside this 
ringfence. 
The UK government accepted the argument that retail banks should be able to maintain 
some simple derivatives functions such as products for hedging currency risk for 
business clients. The Barclays experience is already leading politicians and 
commentators in the UK to argue that simple derivatives may be an oxymoron. Trying to 
define them may be a futile exercise, and one that will inevitably be gamed by banks. 
The UK government shows some reluctance to revisit its interpretation of the Vickers 
proposals. But if the British Parliamentary enquiry into the LIBOR issue now concludes 
that the government has erred on the side of trusting banks, then the pressure for an 
outcome closer to the original Vickers recommendation, to be written into next year's 
Banking Act, will be intense. 
The universal banking debate will take another serious twist if the new leadership of 
Barclays ultimately decides to break the bank up into a retail bank and an investment 
bank and broker/dealer. As extreme as this sounds, the intangible costs in political and 
regulatory animus Barclays now attracts could suggest that a clean break makes sense. 
An arrangement that gave existing shareholders a stake in both new institutions might 
be acceptable. 
Barclays would no doubt sell such a split as a smart commercial move. But the political 
and regulatory subtext would be to undermine the case that such banking 
agglomerations are both necessary and useful. Although the French and German 
commitment to their own universal banking systems is very strong, such a split would
