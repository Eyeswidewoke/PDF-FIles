financial consulting fees, advisory fees and transaction fees that reduce management fees. 
If the Master Fund failed to file a timely U.S. federal income tax return in respect of its ECI, 
it may subsequently be precluded from claiming deductions related to the ECI and may be 
subject to penalties. 
In general, a foreign corporation that does not conduct a U.S. trade or business is 
nonetheless subject to tax at a rate of 30% on the gross amount of certain U.S. source 
income that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. This tax is generally 
collected through withholding by the payer of the income. Any U.S.-source interest 
received will be subject to 30% withholding unless such interest qualifies as portfolio 
interest. Portfolio interest generally includes (with certain exceptions) interest paid on 
registered obligations with respect to which the beneficial owner provides a statement that 
it is not a U.S. person. The portfolio interest exemption is not available with respect to 
interest paid to a 10% shareholder of the issuer of the indebtedness and is subject to certain 
other limitations. There is presently no tax treaty between the United States and the 
Cayman Islands to reduce the rate from 30%. In addition, the 30% tax does not apply to 
capital gains (whether long-term or short-term) or to interest paid to a foreign corporation 
on its deposits with U.S. banks. 
U.S. Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders. Non-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to 
United States federal income taxation on distributions by the Offshore Feeder Fund in 
respect of their interests or gain realized on a disposition of an interest, unless (i) the 
distributions or gains on the interest are attributable to an office or other fixed place of 
business maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, (ii) in the case of gain 
realized, the Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual who is present in the 
United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition or has a "tax 
home" in the United States or (iii) the Non-U.S. Holder is a former U.S. citizen or resident 
alien. A Non-U.S. Holder will not be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business solely 
by reason of holding the interest in the Offshore Feeder Fund. 
Individual Investors who are neither present nor former U.S. citizens nor U.S. residents (as 
determined for U.S. estate or gift tax purposes) are not subject to U.S. estate and gift taxes 
with respect to their ownership of such interest. 
U.S. Taxation of U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors. Income recognized by U.S. Holders that 
are U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors is generally exempt from U.S. federal income tax except to 
the extent of the entity's UBTI. UBTI is defined generally as income from a trade or 
business regularly carried on by a tax-exempt entity that is unrelated to its exempt purpose. 
Dividends, interest and, with certain exceptions, gains or losses from the sale, exchange or 
other disposition of property are generally excluded from UBTI. U.S. Tax-Exempt 
Investors that are "charitable remainder trusts" are subject to a 100')/0 excise tax on their 
UBTI. 
If a U.S. Tax-Exempt Investor's acquisition of an interest in the Offshore Feeder Fund is 
debt-financed, the U.S. Tax-Exempt Investor's "debt-financed income" will be included in 
computing UBTI and, consequently, all or a portion of such investor's income attributable 
to the Offshore Feeder Fund would be included in UBTI, regardless of whether such
