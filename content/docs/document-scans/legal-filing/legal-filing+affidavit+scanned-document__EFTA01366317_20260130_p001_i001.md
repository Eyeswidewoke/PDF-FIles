purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial 
business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you 
would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need 
of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your stock in the open market; however, at such time our stock 
may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a 
material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we 
liquidate or you arc able to sell your stock in the open market. 
The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame may 
give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may decrease 
our ability to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets as we approach our 
dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our business combination on terms 
that would produce value for our stockholders. 
Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will 
be aware that we must complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this 
offering. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, 
knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may 
be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get 
closer to the timcframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may 
enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive 
investigation. 
We may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in 
which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our 
public shares and liquidate. 
Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed that we must complete our 
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering. We may not be able to find a 
suitable target business and complete our initial business combination within such time period. If we have not 
completes, our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the 
purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, 
redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash. equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in 
the torsi account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable. and less up to $50,000 of interest 
to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will 
completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation 
distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such 
redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and 
liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the 
requirements of other applicable law. 
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, executive 
officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares from public stockholders, which may 
influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public "float" of our common stock. 
If' we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in 
connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, 
30 
our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated 
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, 
although they arc under no obligation to do so. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that 
such stockholder. although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and 
therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors. executive officers. 
advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have 
already elected to exercise their redemption rights. such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their 
prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of the 
business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business 
combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net 
worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such 
requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may 
not otherwise have been possible. 
In addition, if such purchases are made. the public "float" of our common stock and the number of beneficial 
holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or 
trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
