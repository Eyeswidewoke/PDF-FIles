785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, "; 
126 Fair Empl, Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
Given ["126] the wide variance in promotions practices at the Nucor facility, the district 
court did not clearly err in rejecting a statistical study that failed to account for that 
variance. 
c. 
The majority finds, however, that Nucors entire plant should be treated "as a single entity" 
when it comes to promotions decisions. Maj. op. at 35-36 (alluding to Brown I, 576 F.3d at 
158). Although the majority suggests otherwise, Brown I did not decide this issue. Brown I 
held that the district court should treat Nucor's various production departments as a single 
facility only for purposes of Plaintiffs' hostile work environment claim. 576 F.3d at 158 
("[T]he affidavits of employees in one department are admissible to prove a plant-wide 
hostile environment that affected employees in other departments, and the plaintiffs have 
satisfied the commonality requirement for their hostile work environment claim." (emphasis 
added)); see also id. at 157 (discussing how a "hostile environment determination" must be 
made in the context of discussing Plaintiffs' "single entity" argument). It said nothing about 
the uniformity of promotions decisions across the plant. Id. The Brown I majority did so 
because Plaintiffs likewise focused their "single entity" argument on ["127] only the 
hostile work environment claim. See Brief for Appellant at 25-35, Brown I, 576 F.3d 149, 
2008 WL 2307453. Thus, as with predominance, the district court was not constrained in 
deciding the "single facility" issue, as no Brown I mandate existed as to that issue. 
Nonetheless, the majority concludes that facts establishing a single hostile work 
environment claim also establish a common promotions policy. Maj. op. at 37. Yet 
"[d]isparate treatment . . . is inherently different from hostile work environment. The federal 
courts treat the two types of cases differently for good reason." See Pollard v. E.I. DuPont 
de Nemours Co., 213 F.3d 933, 943 (6th Cir. 2000), rev'd on other grounds, 532 U.S. 843, 
121 S. Ct. 1946, 150 L. Ed. 2d 62 (2001). And no court has held that a common hostile 
work environment establishes that a facility must be treated as a single entity for purposes 
of every other kind of employment discrimination claim. 
In finding a common environment, Brown I focused on shared locker rooms and spaces, 
plant-wide email, and plant-wide radio systems. 576 F.3d at 158. When it comes to a 
hostile work environment claim, those facts may matter: racial slurs and "monkey noises" 
uttered in a common space or transmitted via plant-wide [146] radio can affect whoever 
hears them. See Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 762, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 
L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998) ("[A]nyone who has regular contact with an employee can inflict 
psychological injuries [" 128] by his or her offensive conduct."). But locker rooms and 
radios bear no relationship to promotions decisions; certainly nothing in the record 
supports such a concept. Only supervisors can inflict the "pain" of a denied promotion, and 
they can do so only when empowered by company structure, not common spaces. We 
should not assume that dozens of supervisors acted in concert merely because their 
employees might have changed clothes in the same room. Nor should we assume -- in the 
face of expressly different criteria applied to different groups of employees -- that 
applicants in each department nevertheless suffer the same injury merely because of their 
physical proximity to one another at some point during a workday. Though the majority 
insists that "centralized, circumscribed environments" will "generally" increase 
"consistency" in managerial decisionmaking, maj. op. at 33, Plaintiffs' own expert made
