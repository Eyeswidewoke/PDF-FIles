S-1/A 
• Disparate and disjointed offerings. 
Sellers must laboriously piece together hardware, software, and payments services 
from many different vendors to run their businesses. Because these products and services are not integrated, sellers often 
resort to reconciling these disparate systems with pen and paper or with spreadsheets. 
• Slow, unpredictable access to funds. 
Traditional payments solutions and financial services often require sellers to wait 
days or weeks to receive funds. According to a study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Spring 2014, 
the average small business loan application process takes 33 hours of work and includes applying to three different 
financial institutions. 
• Lack of transparency. 
Many traditional providers offer terms and pricing that are opaque, complex, and unpredictable. 
For example, traditional providers typically charge a wide range of fees that are hard for sellers to understand or 
anticipate. These fees may include terminal fees, hardware rental fees, payment gateway fees, compliance fees. minimum 
monthly fees, and reporting fees, in addition to interchange and assessment fees that vary widely across card and 
transaction types. 
Our End-to-End Commerce Ecosystem 
Payments are at the heart of commerce and are the foundation of our ecosystem. Every payment a seller accepts creates an 
opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of his or her business. We use these insights to build additional seller services, 
which in tum generate more payment activity, bring more buyers into our network, and further strengthen our ecosystem. All of our 
services feature the following key elements: 
Access and ease of use. 
We design products and services that are simple and intuitive for all sellers. 
• Cohesion. 
Services in our ecosystem connect seamlessly with each other, and we design integrated hardware products 
and software services to provide sellers and buyers with a frictionless experience. 
• Speed and predictability. 
We design our products and services to deliver instant value. Sellers can sign up in minutes to 
take their first payment, getting fast and predictable access to funds. 
• Trust and transparency. 
We build a mutually beneficial partnership with our sellers, based on straightforward pricing and 
dependable services that they can rely on to run and grow their businesses. We also take a differentiated approach to risk 
management that enables us to approve sellers who may have been denied elsewhere, while keeping our risk and fraud 
losses low.

Payments and POS Services 
Our payments and POS services include hardware and software to accept payments, streamline operations, and analyze 
business information. Square Register, our free POS app, combines with our hardware to turn a mobile device into a powerful POS 
solution. Our mobile payments and POS services transform the checkout process and advance digital and mobile commerce by 
untethering sales from long lines and antiquated cash registers. Sellers can also use our services such as Square Analytics and 
Invoices directly from a mobile device. We regularly add advanced software features for our POS solution for specific types of 
sellers. We act as the merchant of record for our sellers, which puts us in their shoes with respect to card networks and puts the 
risk for refunds and chargebacks on us. Because we work directly with payment card networks and banks, sellers do not need to 
manage the complex systems, rules, and requirements of the payments industry. The benefits to our sellers include fast, easy, and 
inclusive sign-up; simplicity; affordability; transparent pricing; fast access to funds; and the ability to take payments anywhere, 
anytime. Buyers benefit from these services by being able to easily pay anyone, anywhere with a payment card or mobile device. 
Unburdened by legacy systems, we create technology that makes payments faster and more efficient. In November 2013, we 
launched Square Cash, an easy way for anyone to send and receive money electronically via email or a mobile app. Individuals 
and businesses can sign up for a Square Cash account using just a debit card and an email address or phone number. Square 
Cash started with peer-to-peer payments, which we offer to individuals for free. Square Cash can also help businesses eliminate 
paper checks and process more of their payments electronically by lowering the cost of payment processing through the use of 
debit cards. Since launch, people have sent over one billion dollars through Square Cash.
