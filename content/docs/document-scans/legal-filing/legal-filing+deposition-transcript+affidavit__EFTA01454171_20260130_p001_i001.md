As you know, China announced its New National Nine Rules" (in contrast to the earlier "National Nine Rules* issued in 
2004), which outline meaningful changes to increase open-ness in Capital Markets out of China on 5/9. DB research 
summary below, bottomline takeaway: "Under such endeavor, China capital markets will be much more diverse, 
structured and transparent in the future, and will a) mobilize massive private savings; b) encourage inward portfolio flows; 
and c) lift market sentiment and valuation." 
From Matt's team: 
"Copper is a popular choice for use as collateral in financing trades. Now China is proposing that local govemments would 
be able to issue bonds rather than rely on, among other things, using copper as collateral for financing trades. Indeed it is 
expected that use of SPVs will be come increasingly difficult. This should be bearish for copper after the regulation is 
passed. Meanwhile, we think that before the regulation is passed, people are trying to secure as much copper-backed 
financing as they can, which has resulted in a scramble for copper, and a spike in price. I would further qualify and say 
that the news announcement has not resulted in a scramble for physical copper yet, but an expectation for the scramble, 
which itself is sufficient to spike up the price. "

On May 9, the State Council of China issued the "Guiding Principles for the Healthy Development of Capital Markets", 
which layouts the detailed roadmaps of China's future capital market development in nine major areas, including overall 
requirements, stock market, bond market, private equity, futures market, the competitiveness of the securities and 
futures sector, capital market openness, financial risks and market regulation. The policy is also referred as the "New 
National Nine Rules", in contrast to the earlier "National Nine Rules" issued in 2004. Under the nine broad guidelines,
