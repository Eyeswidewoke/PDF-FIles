as to payment, security, or otherwise as my Trustees determine, either by public or private 
transactions; 
4. To buy and sell options, warrants, puts, calls or other rights to purchase or 
sell (collectively called "options") relating to any security or securities, regardless of whether 
such security or securities are then held by my Trustees, and whether such options are 
purchased or sold on a national securities exchange, and to exercise with respect to such 
options all powers which an individual owner thereof could exercise, including, without 
limitation, the right to allow the same to expire;

and rights to and interests therein (together with all equipment pertaining thereto) including,
