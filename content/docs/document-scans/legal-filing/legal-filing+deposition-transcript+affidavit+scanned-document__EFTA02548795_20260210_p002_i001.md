appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and =raciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose =f your report 
is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of =arassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 
=miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain =keptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations 
and =nnuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and =udge the facts in context. The fact that 
Universities and other =rganizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to =eetings is because they 
value my contributions and my =ctions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a =onsensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 
where we mutually decided, =n a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be =ppropriate, and there 
were respectful and platonic encounters =fterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an 
=nonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there =re no details provided, and it clearly was not taken 
seriously enough =o result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are =ou saying that because I decided I didn't 
want to go out to a =ar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The =econd part did not happen. Re 
incident 5: The 'female =ompanion' in this case is my wife, who accompanied me on the =ruise, and has attested to the 
fact that the claim is false. This =s what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing =t to be taken 
down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 =nd 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in =cience communication, and on dozens of occasions came 
to me, asked me =o talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked =bout advice for after graduation I 
DID tell her she was different than =he other students in her year. The rest of them were interested =n going on to 
graduate school in physics, but she was interested in =cience communication so I told her that she might want to take a 
=ifferent path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I =ecall, I did ask her on one of these occasions if that made 
it =ifficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member =nd department chair I was interested in knowing 
what we could do, if =ecessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because =s someone she had 
asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that =ade a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone 
=ack over emails from that period. I have numerous requests from her =sking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually 
had to turn down =ecause I was busy, and on several occasions she asked me to have coffee =ith her off campus to talk, 
and I politely declined. I did let =er accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview =ecause she 
specifically requested it, and I believe she found it =seful. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on =ampus, 
and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat students =s respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked when I later 
=earned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the =niversity, not least because there was no 
inappropriate interaction but =1st) because, well after the dates you listed on which she was =pparently offended, she 
continued to email me with joking questions or =omments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 2008, =or which 
she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of =ecommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our 
taxi well =ut out of our way in order to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in =n email response to her email about the 
conference, again in 2008, I =xpressed that I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. =nbsp;When the 
University later informed me of the complaint I was =hocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources 
=erson, including relating my concerns and explaining the situation, I =as told that no formal complaint of sexual 
harassment was requested. =nbsp;By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my =ntentions to 
leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very =ifficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the 
=niversity, the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there—=both among the faculty (many of whom in physics I 
had hired while =epartment chair)) and among the administration, along with a very =ttractive counter-offer by Case. 
Because I was already in Arizona =t the later time I was asked not to have any further interaction with =he student I 
agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities =nd also because it was basically moot because I was not on 
campus. =ollowing this episode, as indicated in the letter to the student, I did =ssess what might have led to 
misinterpretations by this student, and =ecame more careful in offering advice when talking to students. I =as also told 
by human resources that because it was decided to handle =his informally and not formally, that (a) it should remain 
=onfidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no further =omplaints were lodged in that case, that the University 
would preserve =ts confidentiality and remove the complaint from my record after 5 =ears, which makes me surprised 
and concerned that someone violated that =ritten agreement with you.
