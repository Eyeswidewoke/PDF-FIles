Individual Retirement Accounts 
The Agreements and Disclosures booklet contains the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements and 
the IRA Disclosure Statements that apply to any Traditional, Roth, SEP or SIMPLE Individual 
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you open with us now or in the future. If we make changes to 
the UBS IRA Custodial Agreement and the IRA Disclosure Statement we will send you 
updated documents, and you agree to be subject to those updated terms and conditions. 
According to the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements, UBS Financial Services Inc. is named as 
the custodian of your IRA when we accept the Account. At your death, the beneficiary or 
beneficiaries whose name(s) are shown on the Account Information pages of the 
Completing Your New Account Process package will become entitled to your IRA. 
Beneficiaries must be named in writing. Your written designation may apply to future 
accounts, and in that case, we will confirm your designation in the Completing Your 
Account Opening Process package. if you do not designate beneficiaries, or your 
beneficiary designation does not effectively dispose of the assets, your beneficiary with 
respect to the IRA or any part of the IRA not effectively disposed of, will be your surviving 
spouse, or your estate if you do not have a surviving spouse. 
You may be charged a Custodial Account fee in connection with this IRA. 
If this IRA account is funded via transfer from another financial institution, you represent 
that all transfers to this account originate from (1) an IRA in the same name and of the 
same type (e.g. traditional, Roth), (2) an inherited IRA in the same name and of the same 
type, or (3) a qualified plan account which you were entitled to rollover to an IRA. 
You agree that if you roll over assets of a qualified plan to a UBS IRA now or in the future, 
you are responsible for reviewing the options available and evaluating the investment and 
non-investment considerations described in the enclosed IRA Rollover Disclosure. You are 
responsible for reviewing, understanding and making an independent decision with respect 
to the fees and costs associated with a UBS IRA. You also understand that none of the 
information provided to you by UBS or its employees about rolling over to an IRA is 
provided as part of any existing fiduciary relationship to your employer's plan under ERISA 
and that neither UBS nor its employees act as an ERISA fiduciary in supplying such 
information. 
Accounts with Cash Management Features 
The Agreements and Disclosures booklet contains the terms and conditions that apply to 
the cash management features you may select. All requests to enroll in cash management 
features are subject to approval. We consider your continued use of your Account as your 
acceptance of the applicable terms and conditions. 
There are important differences in the cash management features and other services that 
are available to U.S. residents through UBS accounts and those that are available to clients 
who reside outside the US. For example, we have different sweep programs for uninvested 
cash and different Card programs for these accounts. This agreement and the Agreements 
and Disclosures booklet describe which programs apply to which types of accounts. 
Verbal Authorization to Upgrade or Add Cash Management Features to an Account 
For any account you have with us now or may open in the future, we may accept verbal 
requests to upgrade or add cash management features to your Account. Generally, we 
permit any authorized person to provide verbal instructions to upgrade or add services to 
your Account unless you instruct us otherwise. In some circumstances, we may ask you or 
another person who is named on the account to sign additional documents or provide 
additional information for those additional features. We will provide you updated terms 
and conditions for the services you request if we have not already sent them to you or 
another owner of the Account. We consider your use of the Account as your acceptance of 
the applicable terms and conditions.

As a service to you, we offer options for the automatic investment or deposit of available 
cash balances ("sweep") in your Accounts. Current Sweep Options include the UBS Bank
