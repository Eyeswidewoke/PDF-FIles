Mr. Epstein started providing Mr. Black with tax and estate-planning advice around 1997 and began 
serving as a director of Mr. Black's family foundation. Over time, Mr. Epstein earned millions in fees 
advising Mr. Black. 
Mr. Black already was getting advice on taxes and estate planning from top accountants and attorneys. 
An adviser from a prominent law firm expressed concerns over the aggressiveness of Mr. Epstein's tax-
minimization strategies, said a person familiar with the matter. 
Mr. Black and two other Apollo executives each donated $167,000 to a foundation associated with Mr. 
Epstein, a 1999 charity filing shows. The contributions were payment for getting them a good deal on a 
private plane, said a person familiar with the donations. 
Charity filings show Mr. Epstein remained on the board of Mr. Black's foundation until 2012. Mr. Epstein 
resigned in 2007, according to a spokeswoman for the foundation and Delaware tax filings. The 
spokeswoman said his name mistakenly appeared on the filings until 2012, when it was noticed and 
subsequent filings were corrected. 
In 2015, Gratitude America Ltd., a Virgin Islands-based foundation associated with Mr. Epstein, received 
a $10 million cash gift from a Black-related entity, according to charity filings and a person familiar with 
the transaction. 
A spokesman for Apollo and a spokeswoman for Mr. Black didn't provide a comment. 
By the late 1990s, Mr. Epstein's connections with wealthy people had drawn the attention of top 
executives of JPMorgan, where he was a client. One of the executives told the newly named head of its 
private bank, Jes Staley, to get to know Mr. Epstein, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Mr. Epstein was a master at introducing an eclectic mix of wealthy, connected people to each other, and 
he started connecting a string of acquaintances to Mr. Staley and recommending JPMorgan's private 
bank—something he would do for another seven years—a person close to the relationship said. 
Mr. Epstein connected JP Morgan to Glenn Dubin, co-founder of Highbridge Capital Management, one 
of the fastest-growing hedge-fund firms of the 2000s. In the 1980s, Mr. Epstein had dated the woman 
who would later become Mr. Dubin's wife, Eva Andersson-Dubin, who is a physician and former model. 
In the early 1990s, Mr. Dubin, accompanied by Ms. Andersson, met Mr. Epstein at a political fundraiser 
Mr. Epstein hosted, according to a person close to Mr. Dubin. 
JPMorgan hired Mr. Dubin's fund to manage assets tied to offshore reinsurance products that helped 
private-banking clients minimize taxes, said people close to Highbridge. Mr. Staley was impressed with 
the performance and started funneling private-banking clients' money directly into Highbridge's growing 
hedge fund. 
A $10 million investment Mr. Epstein made in Highbridge in 1999 turned into roughly $29 million, the 
people said. He also pitched tax strategies to managers of the firm, said someone familiar with those 
discussions. 
JPMorgan bought control of Highbridge in 2004 for more than $1 billion. Mr. Epstein earned a fee of 
around $15 million from Highbridge, according to people familiar with the payment. One said the fee 
stemmed from Mr. Epstein's role introducing Mr. Dubin to Mr. Staley years earlier. 
There was confusion at times among senior people inside Highbridge, including by co-founder Henry 
Swieca, about the fee's purpose. Some people felt it was odd to compensate someone for an
