For the Period 6/1/12 to 6/30/12 
For your convenience we have combined statement(s) for activity you conduct through J.P. Morgan in one package. Below are important disclosures relating to these different accounts. 
These statements may relate to various account types. Some of the disclosures are applicable to all of your accounts. For ease of reference the disclosures applicable to a particular type 
of account have been grouped together by descriptive headers. 
IMPORTANT GENERAL INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO ALL OF YOUR ACCOUNT(S) 
Important Information about Pricing ,Valuations, Estknated Annual Income, and Estimated Yield 
Market value information (including without limitation, prices, exchange rates, acaued income and bond ratings) furnished herein, some of which has been provided by pricing sources that J.P. Morgan 
believes to be reliable, is not guaranteed for accuracy but provided for informational purposes and is furnished for the exclusive use of the client. 
The current price is the value of the financial asset share, unit or contract as priced at the dose of the market on the last day of the statement period or the last available price. All values provided for 
structured yield deposits (for example. JPMorgan London Time Deposits) reflect the original deposit amount only. The value for Real Estate. Mineral Interests and Miscellaneous Assets may not reflect 
the most current value of the asset. 
Important information regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily, weekly 
and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the event 
of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements and online. Accordingly, investors should not 
rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with respect to ARS. When J.P. Morgan is unable to obtain a price from an internal or outside source for a particular ARS, the price 
column on your statement will indicate "unpriced". 
Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are sourced from the various 
issuers of the securities or they are sourced from a third party valuation provider. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the 
valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are 
intended solely for your own use. Please refer to the trade confirmation for details of each transaction. 
Certain assets, including but not limited to, pooled and private investments, non-publicly traded and infrequently traded securities, derivatives, partnership interests and tangible assets are generally 
illiquid. the value of such asset may have been provided to us by third parties who may or may not be independent of the issuer or manager. Such information is reflected as of the last date provided to 
us, and is not independently verified. 
In cases where we are unable to obtain a current market value from an internal or outside source for a particular security, the price column on your statement will indicate "unaiced". Although such 
securities may have value, please note that the value of a security indicated as 'unpriced" will not be included in your overall current market value as reflected on the statement. 
J.P. Morgan makes no representation, warranty or guarantee, express or implied, that any quoted value represents the actual terms at which securities could be bought or sold or new transactions could 
be entered into, or the actual terms on which existing transactions or securities could be liquidated. Such values may only be indicative. 
When we are unable to obtain a current value from an internal or outside source for a particular security, the price column on your statement will indicate "unpricee. 
If a partial call is made with respect to an issue of securities included in your Accounts we will allocate the call by a method we deem fair and equitable. 
To the extent applicable, please note the following regarding estimated annual income (EAI) and estimated yield (EY): EAI and EY for certain types of securities could include a retum of principal or 
capital gains in which case the EAI and EY would be overstated. EAI and EY are estimates and the actual income and yield might be lower or higher than the estimated amounts. EY reflects only the 
income generated by an investment. II does not reflect changes in its price, which may fluctuate.
