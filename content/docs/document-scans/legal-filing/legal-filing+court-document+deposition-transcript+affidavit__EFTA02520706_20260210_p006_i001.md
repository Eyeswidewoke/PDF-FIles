My name is Adam Waldman, and I am Professor Lawrence=Krauss' litigation counsel. Earlier this 
week, I sent the att=ched letter to Buzzfeed via one of their reporters named Peter Aldhous. &nb=p; 
I am also in receip= of Mr. Aldhous' letter to ASU, which is a variation on defamation =80 both 
libel and slander — that Mr. Aldhous and his colleagues h=ve been manufacturing for at least 6 months (notably without 
any reporting)=in a campaign with a purpose known only to them. Buzzfeed's f=rst method is to call or write third 
parties, posit a list of fake, anonymo=s, recklessly false and malicious "allegations," and ask if=the third party has 
anything to add. Buzzfeed's second method=is to seek tortious interference with Professor Krauss' professiona= 
contracts, by writing third parties with whom Professor Krauss is in privi=y, present a similarly inflammatory series of 
anonymous, recklessly false a=d malicious accusations, and then question: how can the email's rec=pient allow such a 
person to serve on their board, or speak at their confer=nce? The letter from Buzzfeed to the University falls into both 
categ=ries. There will be appropriate legal consequences for Buzzfeed's a=tions. 
It is my under=tanding that your office believes it is compelled by the above to investiga=e false, 
defamatory, anonymous accusations posited by the online tabloid Bu=zfeed by contacting third parties and potentially 
rebroadcasting the tabloi= Buzzfeed's accusations. To be clear, these accusations were n=t made to the University by 
actual human beings who are alleging they were v=ctims. There is no evidence they were presented to Buzzfeed by 
actual=human beings. Moreover, no present or former employees of ASU have made any=such allegations to your 
office, or to any office at ASU, to our knowledge.=They are simply alleged by a tabloid, and one that had yet published a 
=9Cstory" on the topic when they forwarded these to you. You may propo=e to rebroadcast this tabloid's libel to other 
third parties who have also m=de no accusation against Professor Krauss. I suggest that you consult=with the 
University's counsel before taking so rash a step as re-br=adcasting hearsay defamation that came to you via an online 
tabloid under t=ese circumstances. 
Profess=r Krauss and I both recognize the absolute need to investigate real allegat=ons. Some 
of the women who have bravely come forward with personal ha=assment allegations against Harvey Weinstein are my 
clients and friends.&nb=p; Some of these victims have been advised by me. Those actual allega=ions are entirely distinct 
from a tabloid attempting to manufacture allegat=ons to create harm.

Subject: Cease and Desist/Professor Lawrence Krauss 
Dear M=. Aldous: 
I am writing a= litigation counsel to Professor Lawrence Krauss. It has come to my a=tention 
that you and Buzzfeed have engaged in an outrageous and protracted d=famation campaign against Professor Krauss, 
including both libel and slande=. Buzzfeed's campaign has been malicious, undertaken with abs=lute reckless disregard 
for the truth, and despite repeated disprovals of t=e falsehoods you continue to harmfully disseminate. Your 
defamatory e=forts have also been undertaken, for reasons known only to you and your col=eagues, with the intention 
of tortiously interfering with the contracts of P=ofessor Krauss, and Buzzfeed has unfortunately succeeded in this 
malignant p=rpose. We have both testimony and documents from a litany of well res=ected third parties that provide 
overwhelming evidence of your and Buzzfeed=E2 s malfeasant attacks on Professor Krauss. We are still tallyi=g the 
damage.
