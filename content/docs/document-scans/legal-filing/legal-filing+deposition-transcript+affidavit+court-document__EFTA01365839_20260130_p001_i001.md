Amendment No. 3 to Form S-I 
Table of Control' 
• 
otherwise dispose of any shares of common stock, options or warrants to acquire shares of common stock, or securities exchangeable or 
exercisable for or convertible into shams of common stock currently or hereafter owned either of record or beneficially, or 
publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing for a period of I80 days after the date of this prospectus without the prior 
written consent of Jefferies LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. 
This restriction terminates after the close of trading of the common stock on and including the 180th day after the date of this prospectus. 
Jefferies LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may, in their sole discretion and at any time or from time to time before the termination of the 
180-day period. release all or any portion of the securities subject to lock-up agreements. 
Stabilization 
The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, certain persons 
participating in the offering may engage in short sale transactions, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions or the imposition of 
penalty bids in connection with this offering. Them activities may have the effect of stabilizing or maintaining the market price of the common 
stock at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. Establishing short sales positions may involve either "covered" short 
sales or "naked" short sales. 
"Covered" short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters option to purchase additional shams of our common 
stock in this offering. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares of 
our common stock or purchasing shares of our common stock in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered short 
position, the undenvriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price 
at which they may purchase shams through the option to purchase additional shares. 
"Naked" short sales are salts in excess of the option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. The underwriters must close out any 
naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be cleated if the underwriters arc concerned 
that there may be downward pressure on the price of the shares of our common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect 
investors who purchase in this offering. 
A stabilizing bid is a bid for the purchase of shares of common stock on behalf of the underwriters for the purpose of fixing or maintaining the 
price of the common stock. A syndicate covering transaction is the bid for or the purchase of shams of common stock on behalf of the underwriters 
to reduce a short position incurred by the underwriters in connection with the offering. Similar to other purchase transactions. the underwriter's 
purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or 
retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that might 
otherwise exist in the open malice'. A penalty bid is an arrangement permitting the underwriters to reclaim the selling concession otherwise 
accruing to a syndicate member in connection with the offering if the common stock originally sold by such syndicate member am purchased in a 
syndicate covering transaction and therefore have not been effectively placed by such syndicate member. 
None of us or any of the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions 
described above may have on the price of our common stock. The underwriters are not obligated to engage in these activities and, if commenced, 
any of the activities may be discontinued at any time. 
Electronic Dbtribution 
A prospectus in electronic format may be made available by e-mail or on the websites or through online services maintained by one or more of 
the underwriters or their affiliates. In those cases, prospective investors may view offering terms online and may be allowed to place orders online. 
The underwriters may agree with us to allocate a specific number of shares of common stock for sale to online brokerage account holders. Any 
such allocation for online
