securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal 
and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and 
increased demand on our systems and resources. As a result, our executive officers' attention may be 
diverted from other business concerns, which could materially adversely affect our business and results 
of operations. In addition, the expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and 
corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect compliance with these public reporting 
requirements and associated rules and regulations to increase expenses, particularly after we arc no 
longer an emerging growth company, although we arc currently unable to estimate these costs with any 
degree of certainty. We could be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2020, although 
circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, which could result in our incurring additional 
costs applicable to public companies that arc not emerging growth companies. 
In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public 
disclosure, which are subject to varying interpretations, are creating uncertainty for public companies, 
increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. We 
intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment 
may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of our executive officers' 
time and attention from revenue-generating activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, 
regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to 
ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal 
proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected. 
As a resell of becoming a public company, we will be obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective 
internal control over financial reporting. If there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or 
internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately present our financial statements. 
which could materially adversely affect us, including our businen, reputation, results of operations, financial 
condition or liquidity. 
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to accurately report our financial results. 
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require us to evaluate and report on our internal 
control over financial reporting. There can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial 
reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Furthermore, as we 
grow our business, our internal controls will become more complex, and we may require significantly 
more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Deficiencies, including any material 
weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in 
misstatements of our financial statements that could require a restatement, failing to meet our public 
company reporting obligations and causing investors to lose confidence in our reported financial 
information. These events could materially adversely affect us, including our business, reputation, 
results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
