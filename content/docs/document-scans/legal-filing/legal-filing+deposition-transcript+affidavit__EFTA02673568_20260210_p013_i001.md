Blues." lames =Cannavino was an I.B.M. executive with whom Gates negotiated about operating systems. Cannavino 
would begin meetings by making small talk =about, say, his new car, in a misguided effort to establish some sort of 
personal rapport with Gates. Also, like many other American corporate =executives of his generation, Cannavino would 
spend a lot of time talking about his company's values. This would drive Gates mad. "Every =time you say 'thirteen,' I'll 
know that what that means is that all you =want to do is what the customer wants," Gates says he imagined himself 
=saying to Cannavino. 
"And for every one of these other gibberish slogans, we can also get little numbers. There are a lot of small integers 
available. We'll just tighten these meetings up. You know, Cannavino, if you want to talk about how you're going to save 
the U.S. educational system, okay, we've heard that story. That's a good fifteen-minute one. =That can be number 
eleven." However, Gates managed to swallow these thoughts and let Cannavino talk. "I'm really very good at this stuff," 
=he says. "I know how to be somebody's son. You know, 'Yes, Dad.' " 
A prominent software executive told me, "I.B.M. thought they had Gates by the balls. He's just a hacker, they thought. A 
harmless nerd. What they actually had by the balls was an organism which has been bred for the accumulation of great 
power and maximum profit, the child of a lawyer, who knew the language of contracts, and =who just ripped those 
I.B.M. guys apart." Another leading executive in =the software industry said, "Think of I.B.M. and Microsoft as being a 
chess game, where Microsoft plays black. So they're at a disadvantage. =So they have to set up a trap. Microsoft 
becomes the only supplier of a =commodity that I.B.M. could not produce itself. Having done that, it proceeds to market 
that asset to weaken its partner's position. It's brilliant!" 
Now, thirteen years after that contract, Microsoft is by far the largest software company in the world. It has a market 
capitalization of twenty-three billion dollars--more than General Motors, Xerox, or I.B.M. To what extent Gates is mainly 
a product of I.B.M.'s blunder, and therefore a kind of historical accident, and to what extent he is the first person to 
imagine software as a shrink-wrapped commodity, and is therefore a visionary, is a good question to ask if you are 
seated next to a computer-industry executive =at a dinner party. Although Microsoft continues to manufacture ms-dos, 
=it has severed most of its ties with I.B.M. The break came over the operating system Windows, which Gates introduced 
in 1985. (Paul Allen, =who had a scary encounter with Hodgkin's disease in 1983, retired, cashed in some of his Microsoft 
stock, bought the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team, and built a house with a basketball court on the property, 
where the team could practice. He also provided the funds for = Jimi Hendrix museum in Seattle. Lately, Allen, whose 
Microsoft stock is now worth $2.9 billion, has been in the news for buying nearly twenty-five per cent of America Online, 
an information service, and, most recently, for buying eighty per cent of TicketMaster.) 
Windows is a graphical user interface, or gui (computer people pronounce it "gooey"). Instead of operating the 
computer with keyboard commands, as you do in dos, in Windows you use a =pointing device--a mouse--to access little 
folders and documents on your electronic desktop. Xerox developed the desktop metaphor in the late seventies, and in 
the early eighties Apple Computer commercialized it. =Gates saw that Apple's gui was an easier system to use than dos, 
and borrowed it. When Windows first appeared, it was widely viewed as a kludge (a dog): it was buggy (it had glitches) 
and was a memory pig (it =used up a lot of space in the computer's hard drive), and it was generally less elegant than 
Apple's gui. But Gates stayed with Windows =and kept improving it. Gates understood that it did not matter if the 
software used lots of space on the hard drive as long as hard drives kept getting twice as powerful every eighteen 
months. Also, whereas Apple chose to keep its software proprietary--it could run only on machines that Apple made--
Gates licensed Windows to any computer manufacturer that wanted it, just as he had done with dos. 
When Apple realized its mistake--its strategy limited Apple's share of the operating-system market to the number of 
computers Apple could sell--it sued Microsoft for copyright infringement, but a federal court ruled that "the look and 
feel" of the =desktop metaphor was not covered under Apple's copyright. 
It is often said by Gates' detractors that he has never invented anything, and this is true in a sense, but you could say 
=the same thing about Henry Ford. When the Model T appeared, in 1908, it =was by no means the best car on the road, 
but it worked well enough, and it was affordable and easy to produce, and Ford stayed with it. Even today, most users 
still find Apple's operating system more intuitive than Windows, but, because the market for Windows is so much larger,
