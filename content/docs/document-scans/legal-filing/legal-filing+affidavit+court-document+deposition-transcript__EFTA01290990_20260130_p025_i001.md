Important Information and Disclosures 
Pricing 
This section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including short positions, at the close of the statement period. The market paces have been obtained 
from sources which we believe to be reliable. Pershing may not use the closing price of the particular exchange or marketplace where your position was purchased as the 'Market Price.' Securities for which a 
price is not available are marked "'WA— and are omitted from the Total. 
The estimated annual income (EAI) and estimated current yield (ECY) figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. These figures are not considered to be a forecast or guarantee of future resuks. 
These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable; however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any 
time, and may be affected by current and future eccoomic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making invesUnent, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the 
position quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant. A capital gain or return of principal may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to 
PAW pershing.comibusiness_continuity.html for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. Accrued interest represents interest eamed but not yet received.
