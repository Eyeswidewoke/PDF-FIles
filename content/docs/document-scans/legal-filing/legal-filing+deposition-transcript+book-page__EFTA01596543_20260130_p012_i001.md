billing penod if you pay the Statement Balance on the current billing 
statement by the Payment Due Date in the current billing period, and 
(2) we will credit any payment applied toward Purchases as of the first 
day in your current billing penod if you make a payment by the Payment 
Due Date in the current billing period that is less than the Statement 
Balance. If a Statement Balance was shown on your previous billing 
statement and you did not pay the Statement Balance by the Payment 
Due Date on that statement, then we will not impose Interest Charges 
on any Purchases during the current billing period if you pay the 
Statement Balance shown on the current billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date in the current billing period. For Balance Transfers, 
interest will accrue from the day we send the Balance Transfer to the 
payee. For Checks, interest will accrue from the day the payee accepts 
the check. For Cash Advances, interest will accrue from the day you 
take the Cash Advance. 
How we will calculate your balance subject to interest rate. 
We use a method called "daily balance' (includtny new purchase5). To 
determine the amount of the interest to be charged on your Account 
we first calculate the "Balance Subject to Interest Rate" separately for 
Purchases, for Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances. We apply the 
applicable Daily Periodic Rate (the DPR) (the DPR for each category is 
the applicable APR shown on the front of the statement dmded by 
365), to each of the applicable daily balances for i) Purchases, 
Balance Transfers and iii) Cash Advances. The daily balances foe 
Purchases, for Balance Transfers and for Cash Advances are each 
calculated separately and determined as follows: We take the beginning 
balances for each transaction type on your Account each day, including 
any interest calculated on the previous day's balance, add to the 
respective balances any new transaction, subtract any payments or 
credits and make any other applicable adjustment(s). Your Cardmember 
Agreement provides for compounding of interest. A credit balance is 
treated as a balance of zero. If you multiply the "Balance Subject to 
Interest Rate for each balance category as shown on your monthly 
billing statement by the number of days in the billing penod and then 
multiply each sum by the applicable OPR, the results will be the interest 
assessed, except for mince variations caused by rounding. 
Credit bureau reports and disputes: We may report information 
about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed 
payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your
