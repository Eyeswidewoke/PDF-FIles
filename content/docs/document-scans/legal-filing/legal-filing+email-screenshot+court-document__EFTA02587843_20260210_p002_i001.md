Foundation Medicine reported total revenue of $14.5 million in the second quarter of 2014, a 145% increase compared 
to $5.9 million in the second quarter of 2013 and a 27% increase compared to $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
Revenue from clinical testing in this year's second quarter was $9.4 million, a 233% increase compared to $2.8 million in 
the second quarter of 2013 and a 32% increase compared to $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
The company reported 5,908 clinical tests in the second quarter of 2014, a 263% increase from the same quarter last 
year and a 26% increase from the 4,702 tests reported in this year's first quarter. This number includes 4,960 
FoundationOne* tests and 948 FoundationOne Heme tests. 
The company's clinical assays, FoundationOne for solid tumors and FoundationOne Heme for hematologic malignancies, 
sarcomas and pediatric cancers, provide a fully informative genomic profile that identifies clinically actionable molecular 
alterations to help physicians match relevant targeted therapies and clinical trials with the underlying genomic drivers of 
a patient's cancer. 
"We continued to gain commercial momentum in the second quarter, with strong growth in clinical test volumes and in 
the revenue contribution from our pharmaceutical industry partnerships," said Michael Pellini, M.D., president and chief 
executive officer of Foundation Medicine. "It was especially encouraging to see a large number of new abstracts and 
publications coming from our partnerships and from independent research efforts. These data further validate our 
comprehensive approach to clinical testing and also represent a growing base of evidence supporting the clinical utility 
of our tests, a key factor in the reimbursement equation for payors." 
Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2014 were $21.6 million, compared with $18.3 million for the first 
quarter of 2014. The second quarter increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by continued investment in 
commercial infrastructure and research and development. 
Net loss was $13.8 million in the second quarter of 2014, or a $0.49 loss per share. At June 30, 2014, the company had 
$97.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
"We remain focused on facilitating the practical utilization of our test findings in clinical care," said Vincent Miller, M.D., 
chief medical officer of Foundation Medicine. "Our critical role in the Lung-MAP trial and launch of FoundationOne 
Careline emphasize our commitment to patients and physicians and our efforts to improve access to FDA-approved 
therapies and other therapies under study in clinical trials."
