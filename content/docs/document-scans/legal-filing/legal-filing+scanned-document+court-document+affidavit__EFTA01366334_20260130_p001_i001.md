exceptions. be transferred. assigned or sold by the sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business 
combination and (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis. 
Because each warrant is exercisable for only one-half of one share of our common stock, the units may be 
worth less than units of other blank check companies. 
Each warrant is exercisable for one-half of one share of common stock. Warrants may be exercised only for a 
whole number of shares of common stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, 
upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon 
exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of common stock to be issued to the 
warrant holder. As a result, warrant holders not purchasing an even number of warrants must sell any odd number 
of warrants in order to obtain full value from the fractional interest that will not be issued. This is different from 
other offerings similar to ours whose units include one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one 
whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of 
the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for 
half of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a warrant to purchase one whole share, thus 
making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may 
cause our units to be worth less than if it included a warrant to purchase one whole share. 
The determination of the offering price of our units and the size of this offering is more arbitrary than the 
pricing of securities and size of an offering of an operating company in a particular industry. You may have 
less assurance, therefore, that the offering price of our units properly reflects the value of such units than 
you would have in a typical offering of an operating company. 
Prior to this offering there has been no public market for any of our securities. The public offering price of the 
units and the terms of the warrants were negotiate) between us and the underwriters. In determining the size of 
this offering, management held customary 
52 
organizational meetings with rep,we ntatives of the underwriters, both prior to our inception and thereafter, with 
respect to the state of capital markets, generally, and the amount the underwriters believe) they reasonably could 
raise on our behalf. Factors considered in determining the size of this offering. prices and terms of the units. 
including the common stock and warrants underlying the units, include: 
• the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies; 
• prior offerings of those companies; 
• our prospects for acquiring an operating business at attractive values; 
• a review of debt to equity ratios in leveraged transactions; 
• our capital structure; 
• an assessment of our management and their experience in identifying operating companies; 
• general conditions of the securities markets at the time of this offering: and 
• other factors as were deemed relevant. 
Although these factors were ixinsiden.id, the determination of our offering price is more arbitrary than the 
pricing of securities of an operating company in a particular industry since we have no historical operations or 
financial results. 
There Is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop, which 
would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities. 
There is currently no market for our securities. Stockholders therefore have no access to information about 
prior market history on which to base their investment decision. Following this offering. the price of our securities 
may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic 
conditions. Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or. if developed, it may 
not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained. 
Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability 
to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target 
businesses. 
The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination 
meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in 
periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer 
documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be
