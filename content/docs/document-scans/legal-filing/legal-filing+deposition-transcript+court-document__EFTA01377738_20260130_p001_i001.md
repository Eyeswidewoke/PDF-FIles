software providers and traditional advertising solutions, as well as with delivery service providers. 
For instance, Square Capital competes with other providers of financing to small and medium-sized businesses, including 
traditional banks, MCA providers, and newer lending models. We believe that the principal methods of competition in the market for 
financing are ease of process to apply for a loan, brand recognition and trust, loan features, transparent terms, effectiveness of 
customer acquisition, and customer experience. We believe Square Capital competes favorably with other offerings on the basis of 
these factors. However, many of our competitors have more financial resources and access to capital, offer a wider variety of credit 
products, and have larger borrower bases. 
We expect the markets for payments and POS services, financial services, and marketing services to evolve and overlap. 
which we expect will increase competition in our industry. 
Intellectual Property 
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law rights in the 
United States and other countries, as well as on contractual measures. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure, 
and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements 
with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary 
technology. In addition to these contractual measures, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, 
registered domain names, trade secrets, and patent rights to help protect our brand and our other intellectual property.

We have developed a patent program and strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our 
products, services, and technologies where appropriate. As of September 30, 2015, we had 113 issued patents and 460 filed patent 
applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions relating to a variety of aspects of our technology. Our issued patents 
will expire between 2022 and 2034 (with the exception of a single patent obtained through an acquisition, which will expire in 
2016). We intend to file additional patent applications as we continue to innovate through our research and development efforts, 
and to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we deem it beneficial and cost-effective. 
We actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, trade dress, and domain names in the United States 
and in other jurisdictions. We are the registered holder of a variety of U.S. and international domain names that include the term 
"Square" and variations thereof. 
From time to time, we also incorporate certain intellectual property licensed from third parties, including under certain open 
source licenses. Even if any such third-party technology did not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, 
we believe that alternative technologies would be available as needed in every case. 
For additional information about our intellectual property and associated risks, see the section titled "Risk Factors—Risks 
Related to Our Business and Our Industry." 
Government Regulation 
Foreign and domestic laws and regulations apply to many key aspects of our business. Failure to comply with these 
requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private 
litigation, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to 
operate. 
Payments Regulation 
Various laws and regulations govem the payments industry in the United States and globally. For example, certain 
jurisdictions in the United States require a license to offer money transmission services, such as our peer-to-peer payments 
product, Square Cash, and we maintain a license in each of those jurisdictions. We are also registered as a "Money Services 
Business" with the U.S. Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These licenses and registrations subject 
us, among other things, to record-keeping requirements, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the 
investment of customer funds, and inspection by state and federal regulatory agencies.
