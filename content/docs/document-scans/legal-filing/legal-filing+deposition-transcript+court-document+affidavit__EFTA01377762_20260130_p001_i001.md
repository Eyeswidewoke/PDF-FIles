PRINCIPAL AND SELLING STOCKHOLDERS 
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our capital stock as of October 
31, 2015, and as adjusted to reflect the sale of our Class A common stock offered by us in this offering assuming no exercise of 
the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, for: 
• each of our named executive officers; 
• each of our directors; 
• all of our current directors and executive officers as a group; 
• each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock; and 
• the selling stockholder. 
We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. and thus it represents sole or shared 
voting or investment power with respect to our securities. Unless otherwise indicated below, to our knowledge, the persons and 
entities named in the table have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all shares that they beneficially owned, 
subject to community property laws where applicable. The information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any 
other purpose, including for purposes of Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Securities Act. 
We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership prior to this offering on no shares of our Class A 
common stock and 299,483,292 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding as of October 31, 2015, which includes 
142,492,565 shares of our Class B common stock resulting from the automatic conversion and reclassification of all outstanding 
shares of our convertible preferred stock into our Class B common stock immediately prior to the completion of this offering, as if 
such conversion and reclassification had occurred as of October 31, 2015. For more information about the conversion of our Series 
E convertible preferred stock, see the section titled "Capitalization." We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial 
ownership after this offering on 27,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock and 298,133,292 Class B common stock 
outstanding immediately after the completion of this offering, assuming no exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 
additional shares. We have deemed shares of our common stock subject to stock options that are currently exercisable or 
exercisable within 60 days of October 31, 2015, to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person holding the stock 
option for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, 
for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.
