Business and Operational Risks 
Global economic, political, and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer, business, and government spending, which may 
adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability. 
Financial services, payments. and technology industries in which we operate depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer. 
business• and government spending. A sustained deterioration in the general economic conditions (including distress in financial markets, turmoil 
in specific economies around the world, and additional government intervention), particularly in the United States or Europe. or increases in 
interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase 
amount of transactions involving payment cards. A reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease of our revenue and 
profits. 
Adverse economic trends may accelerate the timing. or increase the impact of. nsks to our financial performance. Such trends may 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Declining economies, foreign currency fluctuations, and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors, such 
as cross-border travel patterns, on which a significant portion of our revenues are dependent. 
Low levels of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environments and those markets experiencing 
relatively high unemployment, may cause decreased spending by cardholders. 
Budgetary concerns in the United States and other countries around the world could affect the United States and other specific sovereign 
credit ratings, impact consumer confidence and spending. and increase the risks of operating in those countries. 
Emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in the United States and Europe. and 
adverse economic trends may be more pronounced in such emerging markets. 
Financial institutions may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate cardholder defaults.
