2006 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 1044, * 
chronic pain. Dr. Sautter recommended that the claimant "consider evaluation for return to 
work" and begin working part-time. 
On January 5, 2005, Dr. Ross wrote an addendum to his [11] initial report, upon 
reviewing Dr. Sautter's conclusions of December 7, 2005. He retained his opinion that no 
medical basis existed to prevent the claimant from resuming gainful employment. Dr. Ross 
issued a Second Addendum on January 11, 2006, and addressed the recent reports from 
Dr. Sautter and Dr. Holzer. He maintained his previous opinions. 
The Deputy Commissioner was persuaded by the opinions of Dr. Goss and Dr. Holzer, 
and found that the employer failed to prove that the claimant was released to his pre-injury 
employment. The Deputy Commissioner emphasized that Dr. Goss' release was invalid, 
and at most, "fleeting," and he afforded little weight to Dr. Ross' conclusion that the 
claimant was completely recovered from his injuries. On Review, we find no reversible 
error in this weighing of the medical evidence. 
"Any medical opinion offered into evidence 'is not necessarily conclusive, but is subject 
to the commission's consideration and weighing."' Farmington Country Club v. Marshall, 
47 Va. App. 15, 26, 622 S.E.2d 233, 239 (2005), quoting Hungerford Mech. Corp. v. 
Hobson, 11 Va. App. 675, 677, 401 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991). p12] 
"The probative weight to be accorded medical evidence is for the Commission to 
decide; and if it is in conflict with other medical evidence, the Commission is free to adopt 
that view 'which is most consistent with reason and justice."' Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. 
Robinson, 32 Va. App. 1, 5, 526 S.E.2d 267, 269 (2000), quoting CDS Const. Services v. 
Petrock, 218 Va. 1064, 1070, 243 S.E.2d 236, 240 (1978). 
The extensive medical record reflects that numerous specialists have evaluated and 
treated the claimant. In the fall of 2004 and into the spring of 2005, Dr. Goss rendered 
opinions about his ability to work. The doctor periodically limited the claimant's work 
capabilities and removed him completely from all work. In January 2005, Dr. Goss began 
predicting that he would return to regular duty in March 2005. After evaluation on March 
15, 2005, he released the claimant to full duty and advised that he awaited the result of the 
FCE to "guide future decisions." Within one month, he participated in the FCE, and the 
evaluator concluded that he had the capacity to perform sedentary work. Dr. Goss 
acknowledged ['3] that the report indicated the claimant's significant symptom 
exaggeration and failure to give full effort. Regardless, the doctor restricted him to 
sedentary duty. Dr. Goss maintained this restriction until the claimant began treating with a 
pain management specialist. At this point, he deferred work restrictions to the decision of 
the pain management specialist, Dr. Holzer. 
Dr. Holzer completely removed the claimant from employment, diagnosed multiple 
complaints, and causally related his disability and symptoms to the industrial accident. He 
emphasized that the examinations and diagnostic studies evinced objective problems. 
Given this evidence, the Deputy Commissioner reasonably afforded more weight to the 
opinions of the treating physicians over the contrary conclusions of Dr. Ross. We agree 
with the employer's arguments that some physicians have released the claimant to work at 
least some form of employment, and that the FCE reported his sub-maximal effort. 
However, he presented evidence of other physicians who treated and monitored his
