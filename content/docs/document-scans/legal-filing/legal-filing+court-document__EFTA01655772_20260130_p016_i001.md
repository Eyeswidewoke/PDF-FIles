General Events 
• Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: U.S. Policy and the Israel-Hamas War: A Conversation with 
Ambassador David Satterfield — Friday, February 16, 2024. Location: Online Event, 10:00 AM. As the Israel-
Gaza war enters its fifth month, the humanitarian situation for 2.3 million Gazans is increasingly dire. A 
grinding process of inspections of trucks has slowed delivery of aid, while Israel's ground campaign in 
southern Gaza—where an estimated 1.9 million displaced Palestinians now reside—makes using predictable 
and reliable corridors for transport extremely difficult. What is the future for Palestinians in Gaza? How does 
the Biden administration envision the proverbial day after? And what are the prospects for converting this 
crisis into a better pathway to a two-state solution and closer ties between Israel and the Arab world? Join 
Aaron David Miller as he sits down with Ambassador David Satterfield, the State Department special envoy 
for Middle East humanitarian issues, to discuss these and other issues. 
• Atlantic Council: The Bahamian foreign minister on shaping US-Caribbean ties  — Friday, February 16, 2024. 
Location: Atlantic Council, 4:15 PM. As The Bahamas and the wider Caribbean face rising electricity prices 
and the worsening effects of climate change, significant financial support and strong partnerships will be 
critical to effectively addressing the region's challenges. By reinforcing ties with global actors such as the 
United States, The Bahamas and other Caribbean nations can set themselves up for long-term resilience and 
prosperity. Please join the Caribbean Initiative at Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center on 
its rescheduled date, February 16, at 4:15 p.m. ET for an in-person conversation with the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs the Hon. Frederick A. Mitchell at the Atlantic Council Headquarters, 1030 15th St. NW, 12th floor, 
Washington, DC. 
• The Hudson Institute: Standards and Technological Leadership: Why Foreign Regulatory and Legal 
Developments Matter — Friday, February 16, 2024. Location: Online Event, 12:00 PM. As governments across 
the world seek to establish their nations as technological leaders, several recent regulatory and legal 
developments outside the United States might significantly affect Western companies' ability to compete at 
a global level. The proposed regulation in the European Union on standardized technologies is the most 
recent—and most prominent—example. Join Hudson for a discussion on this proposed regulation and its 
potential impact on the race for global technological leadership in the twenty-first century.
