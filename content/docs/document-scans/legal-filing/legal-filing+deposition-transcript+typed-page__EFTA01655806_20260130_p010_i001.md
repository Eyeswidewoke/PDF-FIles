Goods 
CNN (03/12, Anderson, Balarajan) reported that a flashy, jewelry-wearing Brooklyn pastor was convicted Monday in 
federal court of using a parishioner's retirement savings and trying to extort a businessman while touting he had 
connections to the New York City mayor. The article added that Lamor Whitehead nicknamed the "Bling Bishop," is 
a pastor at the Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries. He was found guilty of five counts, including wire 
fraud, attempted extortion, and making false statements to the FBI. The convictions are from three separate 
schemes. Whitehead, known for his Louis Vuitton suits and extravagant jewelry, also made headlines in 2022 after 
he said he and his wife were robbed of $1 million worth of jewelry at their church. The Daily Beast (03/12, 
Olmsted), CBS News (03/12, Video), and Fox News (03/12, Dorgan) also reported on the story. 
Border Shooting in California: Marksman Killed Man Assaulting Migrants 
The Los Angeles Times (03/12, Toohey) reported that a man fatally shot by a border patrol marksman earlier this 
month near the California-Mexico border was gunned down because he was threatening migrants with a firearm, 
federal officials said. The U.S Customs and Border Protection recently released new details about the March 3 
shooting, which killed a 32-year-old Mexican citizen not far from the Otay Mesa Port of Entry border checkpoint. 
The article added that according to the federal agency, a border patrol tactical unit was set up that day near a 
paved road that runs through the Otay Mountains, a few miles east of the Otay Mesa border crossing, after reports 
of armed robberies and assaults targeting migrants trying to cross into the U.S. The border agents, who were in a 
concealed position, saw the man threaten a group of migrants by loading a firearm and pointing it at them, 
according to the border patrol statement. At that point, a border patrol precision marksman fired one shot at the 
armed man, fatally striking him. The article stated that U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not release video 
from the shooting but said it was "committed to expeditiously releasing the body-worn camera footage of this 
incident as soon as is appropriate to do so and without impacting the ongoing law enforcement investigations." The 
San Diego County Sheriff's Department, the FBI, and the Border Patrol's Office of Professional Responsibility are 
continuing to investigate, officials said. 
Maine Man Charged by FBI Over Online Threats to Kill President Biden, Immigrants 
The Portland Press Herald (03/12, Calder) reported that a Maine man who allegedly threatened in online posts to 
kill President Biden, other politicians, and immigrants has been arrested by the FBI. The article added 
that Benjamin Brown, 45, used YouTube comments over the past several years to make threats toward elected 
officials and immigrants and claimed he was stockpiling weapons in preparation for a violent civil war in the U.S., 
according to a criminal complaint and probable cause affidavit filed in court by Jonathan Duquette, an FBI task 
force officer. The article mentioned that Kristen Setera, spokeswoman for the FBI Boston Division that covers 
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, said Tuesday in an email that Benjamin Brown was 
taken into custody without incident Monday. 
Bryan Kohberger Attorney's Appeal of Grand Jury Indictment Denied by Idaho Supreme Court 
Fox News (03/12, Wehner, Ruiz) reported that a pretrial appeal filed with the Idaho Supreme Court by Bryan 
Kohberger's public defenders was denied Tuesday, though the reasoning behind the denial was not provided. 
Kohberger's attorneys claimed prosecutors indicted their client improperly on four counts of first-degree murder 
and a single count of burglary, to the grand jury. The article added that while the grand jury was working toward an 
indictment, prosecutors said they must reach an indictment if the case reaches the higher legal standard of guilt 
beyond a reasonable doubt, instead of the standard of probable cause. The one-page ruling by the Idaho Supreme 
Court did not provide any reasoning for their denial of Kohberger's attorney's filed appeal, and the matter was 
closed. The article noted that the suspect was attempting to delay proceedings by appealing one of the judge's 
individual decisions to a higher court, which was denied. Specifically, Kohberger wanted the Supreme Court to 
overturn the judge's decision not to toss the indictment. The article mentioned that it took police more than six 
weeks to capture a suspect. They arrested Kohberger at his parent's house in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains
