The Cost of On Demand Mobility 
Business models based on Shared Mobility are fundamentally sound, as they 
take advantage of the fact that there are diseconomies associated with individual 
vehicle ownership - vehicles are expensive purchases that depreciate rapidly, yet 
they are only utilized 5% of the time. That said, the cost of using on demand 
mobility services is still quite high compared with conventional vehicle ownership. 
We estimated pricing at -$1.53 per mile, on average, for the main mobility 
offerings fie Uber, Lyft). This compared with the -$0.93 per mile average cost 
for operating a vehicle within the top 20 U.S. MSA's (as noted below, there is 
significant cost variability between MSAs), and a $0.78 average cost per mile for 
private vehicle ownership across the U.S. At a high level, our analysis suggested 
that using ridesharing services may already be cheaper than using a personally 
owned vehicle for -16% of households in high density urban sub-sections (these 
urban households account for -5% of total households in the broader MSAs, and 
they collectively own -2% of the vehicles in these MSAs). 
But there was also significant variability between cities. For example, ridesharing 
appears cheaper than individual vehicle ownership for 25% of households in the 
Los Angeles area and 18% in NYC, but only -6% in the San Bernardino-Riverside 
area. The attractiveness of on-demand mobility in a city such as New York appears 
to correlate well with other data points. For example, NYC had the highest cost 
per mile for operating an individually owned vehicle ($3.35 per mile in Manhattan 
and $1.61 across the rest of the New York MSA). NYC also has the lowest vehicle 
ownership density of any of the major metro areas that we studied (0.6 vehicles 
per household, compared with a national average of 2.1 vehicles per household).

The Economics of On-Demand Mobility improves dramatically when vehicles 
become Autonomous 
As noted above, we believe it will become significantly cheaper (and in major 
cities more practical and convenient) once the driver is removed from the car 
and utilization increases. To determine the cost of operation for an Autonomous 
"RoboTaxi" we assumed that such a vehicle is on the road -17 hours a day (similar 
to an NYC taxi), and generates revenue 80% of that time (compared with revenue 
generation of -53% for uberX and -49% for taxis in NYC today). We acknowledge 
that robo-taxis could conceivably have availability that is even higher. However, 
based on academic studies, utilization declines dramatically overnight (with a few
