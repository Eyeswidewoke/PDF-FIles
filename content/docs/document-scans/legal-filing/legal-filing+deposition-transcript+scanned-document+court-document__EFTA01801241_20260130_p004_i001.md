This bigger issue about the values of the trading floor i= going to prove hard to shake off. The role of securities 
divisions in dri=ing investment bank profits over the last two decades has predictably seen=a generation of securities 
managers rise to the leadership of investment and universal banks. While it is perh=ps unwise to generalise too much, 
most of these men have brought with them=the directness and self-belief that comes with surviving a career on the 
t=ading floor. 
They also bring with them a view of the market and of mar=et-making that is often at odds with the way most 
politicians understand t=em. Watching Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs trying to explain to the US =enate in 2010 why 
it was legitimate for Goldman Sachs as a market maker to be both long and short in the US pr=perty market at the same 
time reinforced the point. There is a yawning gul= between a trader's pragmatic view of financial markets and a wider 
poli=ical and public audience who generally interpret the market maker's pragmatism as cynicism, detachment and 
shor= termism, especially when it results in making a lot of money. 
Banks tend to be highly impatient with this public and po=itical ambivalence. Most banks' response to efforts at 
greater regulatio= of securities markets have often been rooted in the argument that these m=rkets are fundamentally a 
forum for free trade between consenting adults and should be treated as such. It is =his argument that the LIBOR-
scandal, with its taint of market fixing, and =he persistent flow of suggestions of contempt for customers and clients, 
d=es so much to undermine. 
The events of the last two months have succeeded in cemen=ing for good the idea that the banking crisis of 
2008 was ultimately the r=sult of unethical, 'casino' behaviour on the trading floor. Whatever f=ilings banks might have 
exhibited in their ethical standards here, the reality is that the banking crisis had i=s roots in poor lending and risk 
standards, and poor management of loan bo=k funding, rather than wild gambles or duplicity in the securities markets= 
The Vickers Commission explicitly recognised this by focusing on raising capital standards at the retail ban=s that make 
up the backbone of the British credit system. 
Recent huge losses in the Chief Investment Office at J P =organ and conduct like that of Barclays' traders have 
made this di=tinction far too subtle to insist upon politically. This may not matter mu=h in regulatory terms — regulators 
have already embarked on a wide range of securities markets reforms. But it wil= help embed the persistent political 
idea that retail banking is inherentl= 'safe' while investment banking and securities markets business is in=erently 'risky'. 
To which recent events have added the taint of suspect ethical conduct. 
For universal bank leaders who have come out of the secur=ties world, this is likely to be part of the challenge of 
dealing with pol=ticians and regulators over the next few years. Politicians actively quest=oned Mr Diamond's 
credentials to lead a retail bank when he was appointed Barclays CEO in 2011. His departu=e leaves an even greater 
burden on universal bank leaders to understand th= growing political gap between the skillset desired of retail bank 
managem=nt and the caricature of the men and women who make a living on the trading desks. Mr Diamond 
maintained a =lass office on the trading floor at Barcap even after his transition to le=dership of Barclays; a gesture 
heavy with meaning for his critics. </=pan> 
Mr Diamond's instincts were to close this gap by champi=ning a 'citizenship' agenda for Barclays. The main 
problem with this i= not the agenda, or the work that was done by the bank in its name. It was=the persistent 
undermining of this message by the perceived conduct of the bank itself. Not just questions of culture=and character 
raised by the admission that traders had sought to manipulat= LIBOR rates for personal and institutional profit and the 
mis-selling of =ayments insurance and interest rate hedges for small businesses. But also fundamental questions over 
the =ank's business model, the way it rewards its highest earners including M= Diamond himself, its approach to its own 
tax affairs and the 'aggressiv=ness' of the tax services it provides to clients, irrespective of their legality. In this, obviously 
Barclays is=far from alone. 
Politicians are at something of a loss as to how concrete=y to address these issues of values and character and 
this poses a particu=ar challenge for banks. Culture is hard to regulate and the public have no=real appetite or patience
