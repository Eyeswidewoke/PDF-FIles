• 
YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE DIVIDENDS ON THE SECURITIES INCLUDED IN THE INDEX OR HAVE ANY RIGHTS WITH 
RESPECT TO THOSE SECURITIES. 
• 
NON-U.S. SECURITIES RISK —
The equity securities included in the Index have been issued by non-U.S companies. Investments in securities linked to the value 
of such non-U.S. equity securities involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those 
non-U.S. equity securities. Also. there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these 
jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC. 
• 
NO DIRECT EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES —
The value of your notes will not be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies upon which 
the equity securities included in the Index are based, although any currency fluctuations could affect the performance of the Index 
• 
LACK OF LIQUIDITY - 
The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Accordingly, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is 
likely to depend on the price, if any, at which JPMS is willing to buy the notes. You may not be able to sell your notes. The notes 
are not designed to be short-term trading instruments Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your notes to maturity. 
• 
THE FINAL TERMS AND VALUATION OF THE NOTES WILL BE PROVIDED IN THE PRICING SUPPLEMENT —
You should consider your potential investment in the notes based on the minimums for JPMS's estimated value and the Maximum 
Return. 
• 
JPMS'S ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES WILL BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE (PRICE TO PUBLIC) OF 
THE NOTES -
JPMS's estimated value is only an estimate using several factors. The original issue price of the notes will exceed JPMS's 
estimated value because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of 
the notes. These costs include the selling commissions, the projected profits. if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for 
assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the 
notes. See "JPMS's Estimated Value of the Notes" in this pricing supplement 
• 
JPMS'S ESTIMATED VALUE DOES NOT REPRESENT FUTURE VALUES OF THE NOTES AND MAY DIFFER FROM 
OTHERS' ESTIMATES — 
See 'JPMS's Estimated Value of the Notes' in this pricing supplement 
• 
JPMS'S ESTIMATED VALUE IS NOT DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO CREDIT SPREADS FOR OUR CONVENTIONAL 
FIXED-RATE DEBT —
The internal funding rate used in the determination of JPMS's estimated value generally represents a discount from the credit 
spreads for our conventional fixed-rate debt The discount is based on, among other things, our view of the funding value of the 
notes as well as the higher issuance. operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs 
for our conventional fixed-rate debt. If JPMS were to use the interest rate implied by our conventional fixed-rate credit spreads, we 
would expect the economic terms of the notes to be more favorable to you. Consequently, our use of an internal funding rate 
would have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. See "JPMS's Estimated 
Value of the Notes" in this pricing supplement. 
• 
THE VALUE OF THE NOTES AS PUBLISHED BY JPMS (AND WHICH MAY BE REFLECTED ON CUSTOMER ACCOUNT 
STATEMENTS) MAY BE HIGHER THAN JPMS'S THEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES FOR A LIMITED 
TIME PERIOD —
We generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in 
connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. 
See 'Secondary Market Prices of the Notes" in this pricing supplement for additional information relating to this initial period. 
Accordingly, the estimated value of your notes during this initial period may be lower than the value of the notes as published by 
JPMS (and which may be shown on your customer account statements).
