1 did the paul Weiss bill get paid ??? 2. Talk to me before signing anything today important 
10m paid today to gratitude america, a 501 c 3, willl make last year complete. 20 million paid 
today ftc . 10 million july 15 5 million Sept 30. , 5 million jan 1 for all of 16 . tax savings aid 
at 37 ercent . of net. savings. 50 million credit. net. so 150 million free . 
Please take the following in the spirit in which it is meant 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his total and 
utter incompetence was brought clearly , front and center. He may be a step up from Eileen, 
but, if he is , then it is certainly not by much, A major difference is that Eileen knew she was 
over her head. Brad struts his stupiditly whenever he gets a chance. The list of things that were 
done and not done he refused to let be prepared as it will exemplify the outrageious lack of 
progress and prioirties 
A critical example. - Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the 
importance of attentive care and attention to details and mechanics. with regard Phaidon I was 
not shown one single document , not one.!! Brad wanted to keep it private between he, and his 
so called " advisors " however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction 
of the year, I did get to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is 
totally ludicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - of things I 
thought were a priority to get done - still remains in the whole unresolved. Neither Alan nor 
Brad has reviewed the BRH agreement or the TRA , the two largest financial assets of your 
portfolio, inexcusable . 
The IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperate need of a new system - reporting badly 
flawed , and both cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off exercises , when 
either you or brad ask for it - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really 
,no further ahead then it was then , consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office 
was recently told by Brad not to share the outside proposals with me - brad has no idea even as 
to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in the 
office. . Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge 
difference. bad info is rampant a simple emblematic example- 3 million in deductions I'm told 
were taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out they cannot be used at all. ( 
ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they said that is the 
only real question you were focused on ! " were they deducted or not - correct question would 
have been " is there a benefit " !! I asked for the balance sheet and/or P and L for Regan arts , 
the basic first step in order to check your financials. "sorry we never got one?" though 9.8 
million invested, no p&l, nothing!, a construction project run amok , no budget, the coo fired
