Under Section 302 of the Code, a Holder will recognize gain or loss on an exchange of Shares for cash if the exchange (i) 
results in a "complete termination" of all such Holder's equity interest in the Company, =ii) results in a "substantially 
disproportionate" redemption with respect to =uch Holder or (iii) is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" with 
respe=t to the Holder. In applying the Section 302 tests, a Holder must take account of st=ck that such Holder 
constructively owns under attribution rules, pursuant to which the Holder will be treated as owning stock of the 
Company owned by certain family members (except that in the case of a "complete termina=ion" a Holder may, under 
certain circumstances, waive attribution from family members) and related entities and stock of the Company that the 
Holder has =he right to acquire by exercise of an option. An exchange of Shares for cash w=ll be a substantially 
disproportionate redemption with respect to a Holder if =he percentage of the then outstanding Shares owned by such 
Holder immediately after the exchange is less than 80% of the percentage of the Shares owned b= such Holder 
immediately before the exchange. If an exchange of Shares for c=sh fails to satisfy the "substantially disproportionate" 
test, the H=lder may nonetheless satisfy the "not essentially equivalent to a dividend"= test. An exchange of Shares for 
cash will satisfy the "not essentially equivalert to a dividend" test if it results in a "meaningful reduction" of =he Holder's 
equity interest in the Company. An exchange of Shares for cash that results=in a reduction of the proportionate equity 
interest in the Company of a Holder whose relative equity interest in the Company is minimal (an interest of le=s than 
one percent should satisfy this requirement) and who does not exercise any control over or participate in the 
management of the Company's corp=rate affairs should be treated as "not essentially equivalent to a dividend=quot;. 
Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the rules of Section 302 in their particular 
circumstances. 
If a Holder is treated as recognizing gain or loss from the disposition of the Shares for cash, such gain or loss will be equal 
to the difference betw=en the amount of cash received and such Holder's tax basis in the Shares exchanged therefor. 
Any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period of the 
Shares exceeds one year as of the date of the exchange. 
If a Holder is not treated under the Section 302 tests as recognizing gain or loss on an exchange of Shares for cash, the 
entire amount of cash receiv=d by such Holder pursuant to the exchange will be treated as a dividend to th= extent of 
the Holder's allocable portion of the Company's current a=d accumulated earnings and profits. Such a dividend will be 
includable in the Holder's gross income as ordinary income in its entirety, without reduc=ion for the tax basis of the 
Shares exchanged, and no loss will be recognized. =he Holder's tax basis in the Shares exchanged, however, will be 
added to s=ch Holder's tax basis in the remaining Shares that it owns. To the extent =hat cash received in exchange for 
Shares is treated as a dividend to a corporat= Holder, (i) it will be eligible for a dividends-received deduction (subject=to 
applicable limitations) and (ii) it will be subject to the "extraordin=ry dividend" provisions of the Code. Corporate 
Holders should consult the=r tax advisors concerning the availability of the dividends-received deduction an= the 
application of the "extraordinary dividend" provisions of the=Code. 
The Company cannot predict whether or the extent to which the Offer will be oversubscribed. If the Offer is 
oversubscribed, proration of tenders pursua=t to the Offer will cause the Company to accept fewer Shares than are 
tendere=. Therefore, a Holder can be given no assurance that a sufficient number of s=ch Holder's Shares will be 
purchased pursuant to the Offer to ensure that =uch purchase will be treated as a sale or exchange, rather than as a 
dividend, =or federal income tax purposes pursuant to the rules discussed above. 
See Section 3 with respect to the application of federal income tax withholding and backup withholding. 
14. Extension of Tender Period; Termination; Amendments. 
The Company expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion and regardless of whether any of the conditions specified 
in Section 6 shall ha=e been satisfied, at any time or from time to time, to (i) extend the period =f time during which the 
Offer is open by giving oral followed by written noti=e of such extension to the Depositary or (ii) amend the Offer in any 
respect =y making a public announcement of such amendment. During any such extension, =11 Shares previously 
tendered and not purchased or withdrawn will remain subje=t to the
