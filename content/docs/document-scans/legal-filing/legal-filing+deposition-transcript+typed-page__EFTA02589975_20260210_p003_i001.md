subs. We ar= getting very good value for money and have completed substantial work (some structu=al) that that were 
noted on our inspection report. I believe we stretched our budget dollar very well. 
</=pan> 
A lot of work (= repeat) was largely invisible now and related to =tems that appeared on our earlier inspection 
repor= (some structural in a minor way — ) that are long ago fixed. We ar= doing this as discreetly as possible because of 
the nosey neighbor syndrome but at times there has been scaffold=ng up and exterior evidence of work. (The hedge 
helped hide this.)</=> 
</=pan> 
In all of this I have =een guided by the opinions of the top PB brokers (Moens, McCann, Turner, Hall, Hollis). No 
one has mentioned to me a complaint about the unsightliness of =he house and again, I apologize you caught us with 
our pants down. It will not happen again. 
</=pan> 
One factor is t=at even at our marked up selling price expectation, we are talking=close-to land value. This 
summer a similar sized lot as to area (but with more frontage) sold as a ter r down in the mid $7s. Just last week, a 
demolition permit was issued for 170= South Ocean (the house on the north corner of the block) and a new 2 story 
Regency is planned there. So there is a real possibility that this house ca= sell even close to $8 as a tear down. There 
have been multiple stories in T=e Shiny Sheet this summer about how prime this block is for redevelopment. I have b=en 
trying to steer a middle path: making it an attractive as either a move-in conditi=n house or a tear down. This has 
affected my decision-making in how and what =o spend on. It surely, however, doesn't excuse the house being 
unsigh=ly. 
</=pan> 
</=pan> 
Although I have been i= NYC 2 weeks for medical reasons I was in PB all summer paying close attention 
and=regularly touching base with more brokers than I listed above. All are very optimisti= about the house and keep 
moving up their value estimates. I am very confide=t about our being able to sell at a strong price and reasonable 
time.<=> 
</=pan> 
I am out of the=hospital and will be back in PB in a week or at most two. I am feeling much better, my MG 
exacerbation is receding, and have a treatment plan in the works for my pancreatic issue =/span>which will mostly 
happen in PB. I would like to discuss this =ith you at a more appropriate time and I would welcome any guidance, 
insights or referra=s. 
</=pan> 
I (and Steve) am deepl= grateful for your participation. I will not let you down (again).
