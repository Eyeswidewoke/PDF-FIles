F.D.A. officials said on Thursday that the process took so long becau=e it was the first approval of its kind. People 
involved in the appl=cation suspect that the Obama administration delayed approval because it w=s wary of a political 
backlash. The officials said the fish would no= have to be labeled as being genetically engineered, a policy consistent 
w=th its stance on foods made from genetically engineered crops. However, it=issued draft guidance as to wording that 
companies could use to voluntaril= label the salmon as genetically engineered or to label other salmon as no= 
genetically engineered. 
The fish are supposed to be=raised inland in contained tanks to lessen the chances that they will esca=e into the wild. 
AquaBounty and its supporters say this will also be=less stressful on the environment than using pens in the ocean. And 
=t could eventually allow the fish to be raised in the United States, rathe= than being imported, as most farmed Atlantic 
salmon is. For now, ho=ever, the fish are being raised in Panama, from eggs produced in Prince Ethard Island, Canada. 
If the salmon were bred or raised elsewhere, for=marketing to Americans, that would require separate approvals. 
class="MsoNormal"> 
However, moving beyond Canada and Panama seems to be the plan, a=cording to a regulatory filing by AquaBounty a 
year ago. It said at =hat time that after winning F.D.A. approval it would look to build a hatch=ry in the United States 
and expand the one in Canada to sell more eggs to =ish farmers, who would then grow the salmon to market size. 
AquaBour=y said it might also grow salmon from the eggs itself. In addition tr= the United States, it said it eventually 
hoped to sell the salmon in Cana=a, Argentina, Brazil and China. 
The approval could a=d will help other efforts to develop genetically modified animals. Scienti=ts and biotechnology 
industry executives have complained that the long, un=xplained delay in approving the salmon was a deterrent to the 
field. Sever=l other attempts to develop genetically engineered animals for consumption= like a pig whose manure 
would be less polluting, have fallen by the waysi=e. 
Now, however, there has been a surge of interes= in developing new genetically altered farm animals and pets because 
new t=chniques, including one known as Crispr-Cas9, allow =cientists to edit animal genomes rather than add genes 
from other species.=That has made it far easier to create altered animals. Scientists in=China, for instance, recently 
created goats with more muscle and longer ha=r. Researchers in Scotland used gene editing to create pigs resistan= to 
African swine fever. It is not yet clear whether animals created=this way would fall under F.D.A. regulation. 
The Aqu=dvantage salmon contains a growth hormone gene from the Chinook salmon and=a genetic switch from the 
ocean pout, an eel-like creature that keeps=the transplanted gene continuously active, whereas the salmon's ow= 
growth hormone gene is active only parts of the year. The company h=s said the fish can grow to market weight in 18 to 
20 months, compared wit= 28 to 36 months for conventionally farmed salmon.
