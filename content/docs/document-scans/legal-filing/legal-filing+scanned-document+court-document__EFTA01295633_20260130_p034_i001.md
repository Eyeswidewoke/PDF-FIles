r911] The district court made a still more fundamental error by choosing to treat the 
Nucor departments as autonomous operations in the first place instead of part of a single 
facility, contravening both this Court's instructions in Brown I and the district court's own 
prior findings. The district court's original order to certify the class recognized that a 
department-by-department approach had been foreclosed, writing: 
Since the Fourth Circuit rejected Ns Court's characterization r381 of the production departments as separate 
environments, the Court must proceed under the assumption that the production departments were permeable, if not 
unitary. This assumption is buttressed by the fact that Nucor's bidding is plart-wide. and this Court already has held 
that "potential applicants are eligible to prove they would have applied for a promotion but for the discriminatory 
practice." 
J.A. 9705. Wal-Mart provided no grounds for the court to reconsider that finding because 
[HN18] nothing in the Supreme Court's opinion suggests that single, localized operations 
must be analytically dissected into component departments.'° Here, all of the workers' 
evidence concerns a single connected facility. 
16 The dissent insists that Brown l's determination that the Nucor plant should be treated as a single facility only extended to 
the hostile work environment claim. Post at 123-24. Yet the discussion of the issue in Brown I was specifically premised on the 
district court's findings regarding both the "pattern or practice" and the work environment clams. Brown I, 576 F.3d at 157. A 
district court may not typically rektigate "issues expressly or impkedly decided by the appellate court." Bell. 5 F.3d at 66. Here. 
even the district court has recognized rm391 that Brown I prevented a finding that the plaid was not a witary environment in the 
context of the promotions claim. J.A. 9706 (Certification Order). 
Even if not required by our prior ruling, treating the plant as a single entity remains sound. 
In addition to the direct and circumstantial evidence of discrimination in promotions 
decisions in multiple departments, racial bias in one Nucor plant department itself 
diminished the promotional opportunities for black workers in all the departments —
including those who wanted promotions into the infected department and those who 
sought promotions to other departments and needed their supervisors' recommendations. 
To that end, the workers cogently observe that requirements for dual approvals for 
promotions -- by originating and destination department heads — "carilied] the effects of 
racial discrimination from one department and supervisor to another, either by systemic 
tolerance, acquiescence or design." Appellants' Reply Br. 24 (citing Smith v. Bray, 681 
F.3d 888, 897 & n.3 (7th Cir. 2012)). 
Such a conclusion is further strengthened by the workers' hostile work environment claim. 
As the district court itself found. "the plaintiffs have submitted significant proof that the 
landscape of the total work environment [".40] at the Berkeley plant was hostile towards 
African-Americans and that the defendants failed to take 'remedial action reasonably 
calculated to end the harassment."' J.A. 10966; see also Brown I, 576 F.3d at 157-58. That 
environment, the workers argue, supports their showing of an atmosphere of systemic 
tolerance of racial hostility by managers and supervisors, forming part of the overall pattern 
or practice that "infected black p912] employees' promotion opportunities." We agree.

Second, the Wal-Mart plaintiffs' theory of commonality relied, in part, on showing that the 
company maintained a corporate culture that facilitated the uniform transmission of implicit,
