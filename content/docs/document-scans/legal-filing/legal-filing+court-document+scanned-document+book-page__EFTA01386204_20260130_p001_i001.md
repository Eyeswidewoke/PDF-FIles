14. ERISA AND RETIREMENT PLAN MATTERS 
The following is a summary of certain aspects of laws and regulations applicable to retirement plan 
investments as in existence on the date hereof, all of which are subject to change. This summary is general 
in nature and does not address every issue that may be applicable to the Partnership or a particular 
investor. 
The Partnership may accept subscriptions from pension and profit-sharing plans maintained by 
U.S. corporations and/or unions, individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, entities that invest the 
assets of such accounts or plans and other entities investing plan assets (all such entities are herein 
referred to as "Benefit Plan Investors") as well as subscriptions from plans maintained by governmental 
entities, churches and non-U.S. companies. It is not anticipated that the assets of the Partnership or the 
Master Fund will be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended 
("ERISA"), or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, because the Partnership 
and the Master Fund intend to limit the investments by Benefit Plan Investors. It is further anticipated that 
the assets of the Partnership and the Master Fund will not be subject to any other law or regulation 
specifically applicable to governmental, church or non-U.S. plans ("Similar Law"). Under ERISA and the 
regulations thereunder, the Partnership's assets will not be deemed to be plan assets subject to Title I of 
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code if less than 25% of the value of each class of equity interest of the 
Partnership is held by Benefit Plan Investors, excluding from this calculation any non-Benefit Plan Investor 
interests held by the General Partner and certain affiliated persons or entities. The Partnership will not 
knowingly accept subscriptions for limited partnership interests or permit transfers of limited partnership 
interests to the extent that such investment or transfer would subject the Partnership's assets to Title I of 
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, the Partnership has the authority to require the withdrawal 
of all or some of the limited partnership interests held by any Benefit Plan Investor or other plan investor if 
the continued holding of such interests, in the opinion of the General Partner, could result in the Partnership 
being subject to Title I of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Law. 
Certain duties, obligations and responsibilities are generally imposed on persons who serve as 
fiduciaries with respect to employee benefit plans or accounts (-Plans"); for example, ERISA and the Code 
prohibit acts of fiduciary self-dealing and certain transactions between Plans and -parties-in-interest" or 
"disqualified persons" (as such terms are defined in ERISA and the Code). 
In the Partnership's 
Subscription Agreement, each Plan investor will be required to make certain representations, including that 
the person who is making the decision to invest in the Partnership is independent and has not relied on any 
advice from the Partnership, the General Partner, the Investment Manager or any placement agent 
associated with the Partnership, or any of their affiliates with respect to the investment in the Partnership. 
Accordingly, Plan fiduciaries should consult their own investment advisors and their own legal counsel 
regarding the investment in the Partnership and its consequences under applicable law, including ERISA, 
the Code and any Similar Law. 
All Plans subject to Title I of ERISA ("ERISA Plans") are required to file annual reports (Form 5500) 
with the U.S. Department of Labor setting forth the fair market value of all ERISA Plan assets. Under 
ERISA's general reporting and disclosure rules, ERISA Plans are required to include information regarding 
their assets, expenses and liabilities. 
To facilitate a plan administrator's compliance with these 
requirements, it is noted that the descriptions of the fees and expenses contained in this Memorandum, 
including but not limited to any Incentive Allocation allocable to the General Partner and the Management 
Fee payable to the Investment Manager, as supplemented annually by the Partnership's audited financial 
statements and the notes thereto, are intended to satisfy the alternative reporting option for "eligible indirect 
compensation' on Schedule C of Form 5500. 
The above statements are based on advice received by the Partnership as to ERISA matters from 
Seward & Kissel LLP, New York, New York.
