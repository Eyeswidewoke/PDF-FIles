below as promised to Dr.Fuster in the last meeting. 
We have been told by Geir Frantzen that Dr.Fuster and the team would be interested in doing a piece of 
research on the GO3 products showing the benefits of Omega-3. We are very interested in conducting 
such a project with a professional team, as this could be a fantastic opportunity to get this important 
message out to as many people as possible through our excellent spokes people and to build a strong 
brand for Omega-3. 
I am not sure about how much detail that has been communicated around the actual research project so 
far in the meetings with Dr. Fuster, the Duchess and Geir Frantzen. From our point of view, the next step 
of this should be a discussion with the team to understand what kind of research Dr. Fuster had in mind 
when suggesting this. We would also like to present the new product formulation to Dr. Fuster, as the 
testing should be done on this specific product. The product will be a highly concentrated Omega-3 oil 
with added D-vitamins. More detail on product specification will come later as this is still in the 
development phase. We would see it as an advantage for the project going forward that Dr. Fuster and 
his team can see the product in the development phase as they might have feedback on the formulation. 
GO3 is delighted about the opportunity to work with the very best within this field. We believe that this 
project will bring a lot of benefits to the partners involved and will work on finding a partnership model 
that will benefit all parties. 
It is our understanding that Dr. Fuster wants to create funds for the important work and research that is 
done through his organization. There are different ways of setting this up, but we would like to discuss a 
model first where every purchase gives a contribution to building these funds. This could be combined 
with a first time contribution that will work as a start up fee for the research and to get the partnership 
going. The actual numbers on these elements and payment terms will be discussed between Keith 
Frankel, Geir Frantzen and Dr. Fuster. 
Furthermore, when the brand is profitable and running we can create special campaigns for the fund to 
create attention around special projects. Having a percentage of every purchase being donated to the 
fund will secure a income stream to the project over time and will also give the opportunity for 
American consumers to feel involved in supporting an important cause. 
To build the credibility of the brand we would in return like Dr. Fuster to be involved in the GO3 brand 
out to the consumers. We need to discuss how this can be done in a manner that will suit all involved , 
but the elements we would like to discuss are: 
Use of quotes from Dr. Fuster about the benefits of Omega-3 on the GO3 website 
Use of references to the research on the web site 
Use of quotes or interview with Dr. Fuster in the infomercial 
Usc of research reference on pack after research has been conducted. 
Usc of reference to Dr. Fuster in PR initiatives
