that he had an extended conversation with =atrick during the time when the murder was committed. In light of this =libi, 
and Amanda's admission she had falsely accused him, he had to =e released. 
Meanwhile, on November 15, the prints inside Meredith's body were =dentified.. They belonged to Rudy Guede, 20 
year unemployed gardener =rom the Ivory Coast. His palm print was clearly visible on the =lood-stained pillow under 
Meredith's hips. His DNA was found on =er clothes and inside her vagina. He also wore Nike Outbreak 2 =neakers that 
were consistent with the bloody footprint on the floor. =e also fit the description of the lone man seen running down the 
=treet at 10:30 pm. He also had knowledge of the cottage. After =laying basketball in the square with the Italian men 
living downstairs =n the cottage, he came to their apartment earlier that week to watch =n auto race and smoke hash 
with them. On that occasion, he met both =eredith and Amanda. 
This hard evidence unambiguously established that he was in =eredith's room, had sexual contact with her, and left 
the room =fter her blood was spilled. 
According to witnesses, he also had =een involved in other recent home 
invasions in Perugia and Milan. In =eptember 2007, a witness said Guede had broken into his home in =erugia at 6 am 
that through a window, brandished a knife, and stole =is credit cards. On October 13th, he apparently broke into a 
=awyer's office in Perugia through a second-story window and took a =aptop and cell phone (which were later found in 
his backpack). Less =han one week before the murder, he been briefly detained by police in =ilan for breaking into a 
nursery and stealing an 11-inch kitchen =nife. 
Rudy Guede, who had fled to Germany, was extradited. But by =hat time Amanda Knox had become such a focus of 
the media's =ttention, and the putative sex games by an angel-faced killer such a =ornerstone of the story, that the 
prosecutors, even after releasing =atrick Lumumba, were not about to abandon their group murder theory. 
To maintain it, chief prosecutor Giuliano Mignini teamed up the =wo insiders, Amanda and Raffaele, with the outside 
burglar, Rudy. =ignini previously had achieved considerable notoriety in Italy in the =001 "Monster of Florence" case 
when he attempted unsuccessfully to =ttribute the suicide of a Pergugian doctor to a secret satanic cult. =ow, he 
proposed a similar satanic scenario in which Rudy, Raffaele, =nd Amanda, went to the cottage together, attempted to 
force Meredith =o have sex with them, and after Rudy and Raffaele took turns molesting =er, Amanda, who he 
described as a"she-devil," stabbed her to death. =or the next four years, this became the prosecution theory of the 
=ase. 
One stumbling block was a lack evidence that Rudy was together that =ight with either Amanda or Raffaele, or even 
had ever met Raffaele. =hile two witnesses had seen Rudy run away, he was alone. No one saw =manda or Raffaele 
enter or leave the cottage. Rudy who was convicted =f murder in a separate "fast track" trial did not claim that =ither 
Amanda or Rudy were with him, His story was Meredith herself =ad invited him to cottage at about 9 PM, had 
consensual foreplay with =im, but, lacking a condom, they stopped. He then left the room and =ent to the bathroom. 
When he emerged he saw an unknown man ran out of =he cottage, and found Meredith bleeding. So he ran away. The 
initial =vidence Raffaele was in the Meredith's room a Nike footprint but now =t turned out it came from Rudy's Nike 
sneaker. What the police =ailed to find was a single print in the room that was Raffaele's or, =or that matter, Amanda's. 
Since Rudy's prints were found, the room =ad not been thoroughly washed. So up until mid December 2007, the =olice 
and prosecutors could not place either Amanda or Raffaele at the =urder scene. Then a DNA analysis of Meredith's bra 
clasp, which =ad accidently remained at the crime scene for 46 days, found DNA on it =hich matched Raffaele's and put 
him at the murder scene. 
DNA analysis also identified both Amanda's and Meredith's DNA =n a kitchen knife in a cutlery draw in Raffeale's 
home. No blood was =ound on it, and, it later developed, the blade was too long to be the =urder weapon (which was 
never found.) Even so, since Amanda said she =ever removed the knife from Raffeale's home, and Meredith had never 
=isited Raffeale's, the presence of her DNA on it, assuming it was =ot cross-contamination, suggested that Raffeale took 
it to the cottage =n the night of the murder. 
In the trial which began January 16, 2009, the prosecutor painted = gory picture of a "she devil" who tortured her 
room-mate with a =nife while Raffaele and Rudy sexually abused her, and when the orgy =nded, she slashed her throat, 
and staged a burglary to dupe the =olice, based largely on the DNA evidence of Raffeale's presence at =he scene, both 
Amanda and Raffaele were convicted of both murder and =exual violence. In December 2009, Amanda was sentenced to 
26 years =mprisonment, and Raffeale to 25 years imprisonment. 
The case was then appealed, and a independent panel of forensic =xperts was appointed to review the crucial DNA 
evidence. It found in =ts 145-page report that the collection of the DNA evidence linking =affaele to the crime scene 
had been egregiously flawed. Not only was =he DNA testimony not consistent with the actual lab reports, but a =ideo 
showed the key items were picked up with a dirty glove that =ight have transferred DNA samples from the suspects to
