MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the 
purchase, ownership and disposition of the debentures. It is the opinion of Wilkie Farr & Gallagher LLP. our 
counsel, and it is based upon the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
"Code"). Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 
aft as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to 
different interpretations. This discussion applies only to debentures that are held as "capital assets." within the 
meaning of the Code. by a holder (as defined below) who purchases debentures in the initial offering at their 
"issue price" (i.e.. the first price at which a substantial amount of the debentures is sold to the public). 
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the material tax considerations 
that may be relevant to a holder in light of its particular circumstances or to holders subject to special treatment 
under U.S. federal income tax laws (such as banks, insurance companies. tax-exempt entities, retirement plans. 
dealers in securities, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, partnerships or other entities 
classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. persons holding the debentures as part of a 
"straddle." "hedge." "conversion" or other integrated transaction. United States holders (as defined below) whose 
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, former citizens or residents of the United States, holders who mark 
securities to market for U.S. federal income tax purposes. or taxpayers that purchase or sell debentures as part of 
a wash sale for tax purposes). This discussion does not address any state, local or foreign tax consequences or 
any U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences. 
For purposes of this discussion, a "United States holder- is a beneficial owner of a debenture that is. for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes: 
• 
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 
• 
a corporation. or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. created or 
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; or 
• 
any other person that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net income basis. 
For purposes of this discussion, a "non-United States holder" is a beneficial owner of a debenture that is not 
a "United States holder.- and "holders" refers to United States holders and non-United States holders. Neither the 
term "non-United States holder" nor the term "United States holder" includes a partnership for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes. If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the 
debentures, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status and activities of 
the partnership and the partner. Prospective holders that are entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to 
them and their partners of holding the debentures. 
Persons considering the purchase of the debentures should consult their own tax advisors with respect 
to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the 
debentures in light of their own particular circumstances, as well as the effect of any state, local, foreign 
and other tax laws. 
Classification of the Debentures 
The determination of whether a security should be classified as indebtedness or equity for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes requires a judgment based on all relevant facts and circumstances. There is no statutory, 
judicial or administrative authority that directly addresses the U.S. federal income tax treatment of securities 
similar to the debentures. Based upon an analysis of the relevant facts and circumstances, under applicable law as 
of the issue date of the debentures, the debentures will be treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes. However, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or a court will agree 
with our determination. No ruling is being sought from the IRS on any of the issues discussed herein.
