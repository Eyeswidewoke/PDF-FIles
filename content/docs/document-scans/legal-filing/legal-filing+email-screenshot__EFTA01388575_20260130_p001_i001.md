The limits of monetary policy 
.etfraTtat Eit1.7n I ?Ave, "N.) 
However, things get somewhat mossy when you think about the practicalities. 
So far, negative interest rates are only charged on balances of commercial 
banks with the central banks. Commercial banks have been reluctant to pass 
this cost on to their clients, so most of the private sector, including practically 
all individual savings accounts, is not charged. This, in turn, means two things. 
First, households are shielded, so lower interest rates will not have an impact on 
household behavior (encouraging current consumption, say, by discouraging 
saving, or prompting households to purchase riskier assets). Second, bank 
profitability will suffer. 
2. What's the evidence so far on the impact on banks? 
In Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland banks have coped reasonably well with 
negative interest rates, in part because their domestic banking markets are quite 
concentrated." This allowed the top two or three key players to make up for the 
shortfall by pushing up profits on other products. For example, Swedish banks 
have been able to protect their net interest margin by increasing mortgage loan 
rates to offset charges on deposit. The problem is that, first, this means that the 
NIRP results in tighter, rather than looser financial conditions. Second, it would 
not work in other, less concentrated markets. And third, and perhaps most 
troubling for the ECB, it means NIRP will have a differential impact in different 
Eurozone countries, depending on the degree of concentration in the local 
banking market 
3. How low can central banks go? 
Therein lies another problem. After all, there was a reason why most economists 
were doubtful of attempts to push interest rates below zero. Reduce the interest 
rates too much, and the private sector might simply withdraw their bank 
deposits and hold the money in cash. Of course, there are some costs to storing 
cash, with some estimates at 20 basis points (bps), and some a bit higher. 
However, the ECB is already in the lower range of such estimates. Moreover, 
comparisons with credit-card charges of several hundred bps are somewhat 
flawed: a large chunk of cash deposits are probably held as a store of value, 
rather than with any immediately looming payments in mind. To implement 
negative deposit rates anywhere near that level, you would probably have to 
introduce a time-varying fee of some sort on (physical) cash of the sort initially 
proposed by the German merchant Silvio Gesell 100 years ago. No country has 
since tried to imp€ement 'Gesell money' and political obstacles look sizeable. 
The evidence so far suggests that when they work, the effect from NIRP is 
mainly from driving down exchange rates rather than by stimulating lending. For 
small open economies, this might even be part of a "foolproof way" to escape 
the liquidity trap and deflation. The idea was for the central banks to give a 
commitment to higher future price levels, concrete action, such as a currency's 
sharp depreciation, to demonstrate that commitment, and an exit strategy of 
when and how to get back to normal." 
In a small open economy, such as Sweden, a currency devaluation can go a long 
way in rekindling inflation. Unfortunately, using devaluation is a lot harder to 
manage in large economies, such as Japan and the Eurozone.
