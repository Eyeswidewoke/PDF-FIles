785 F.3d 895, "; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl, Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
engages in a rather extended discussion of the Brown I dissent and then declares any 
attack on the majority's factfinding today "iron[ic]." Maj. op. at 21. 
Too often, we fail to give standards of review the attention that they deserve. We see them 
recited in boilerplate and then dispensed with when the perceived exigencies of a case 
seem to call for it. But "[s]tandards of review are . . . an elemental expression of judicial 
restraint, which, in their deferential varieties, safeguard the superior vantage points of 
those entrusted with primary decisional responsibility." Evans, 514 F.3d at 320-21. An 
appellate court should not be so quick to ignore them. 
B. 
We must next consider the district court's role in deciding the certification r"891 motion in 
the first place. The majority implies that the district court too readily dismissed Plaintiffs' 
efforts to certify. But the district court was not just permitted to ['931] take a hard look at 
Plaintiffs' submissions -- it was required to. 
1. 
Although plaintiffs shoulder the burden of demonstrating that a proposed class complies 
with Rule 23, the district court has an "independent obligation to perform a rigorous 
analysis to ensure that all of the prerequisites have been satisfied." EQT Prod., 764 F.3d 
at 358. Among other things, this "rigorous analysis" requires the district court "to resolve a 
genuine legal or factual dispute relevant to determining the requirements." In re Hydrogen 
Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 320 (3d Cir. 2008). 
"[C]areful attention to the requirements of [Rule] 23 remains . . . indispensable" even in 
cases "alleging racial or ethnic discrimination." E. Tex. Motor Freight Sys., Inc. v. 
Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 405, 97 S. Ct. 1891, 52 L. Ed. 2d 453 (1977). Thus, "a Title VII 
class action, like any other class action, may only be certified if the trial court is satisfied, 
after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of [the Rule] have been satisfied." Gen. Tel. 
Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982); see 
also Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90, 99, 123 S. Ct. 2148, 156 L. Ed. 2d 84 
(2003) (noting the "conventional rule[s] of civil litigation . . . generally appl[y] in Title VII 
cases"). And there is no "entitlement to class proceedings for the vindication of statutory 
rights," Am. Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 133 S. Ct. 2304, 2309, 186 L. Ed. 2d 417 
(2013), Title VII included. Thus, r*90] the Court must be careful not to bend and twist the 
"rigorous analysis" that Rule 23 compels merely for the sake of abstract notions of Title 
VII's objectives and purposes. Cf. Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 578, 99 
S. Ct. 2479, 61 L. Ed. 2d 82 (1979) ("[G]eneralized references to the 'remedial purposes' 
of [a statute] will not justify reading a provision more broadly than its language and the 
statutory scheme reasonably permit."). To do so would not only ignore the Supreme 
Court's warnings; it might also have unforeseen effects in the many other areas of law in 
which Rule 23 is implicated. 
In basic terms, the rigorous-analysis standard tests whether plaintiffs have presented 
substantial evidence of compliance with Rule 23. Plaintiffs may "not simply plead" that the 
relevant requirements have been met, but must "actually prove" it. Halliburton, 134 S. Ct. 
at 2412; accord Monroe, 579 F.3d at 384. To meet that standard, plaintiffs must summon
