an action where "the party asserting the cause of action has not legal capacity to sue." 
CPLR 3211(a) (3) also embraces the ground of the lack [min of standing to sue, and 
this statute is, therefore, available to support a motion to dismiss on this ground (see Hecht 
v Andover Assocs. Mgt. Corp., 114 AD3d 638, 979 NYS2d 650, 2014 NY Slip Op 632 [2d 
Dept 2014]). 
Burns, in arguing that plaintiffs lack standing to sue, relies upon the third affirmative 
defense in his answer to the first amended complaint and contends that plaintiffs are not 
proper parties and lack standing to sue 2784 LLC and him, as its former manager, 
because they are allegedly not members of 2784 LLC in their individual capacities. 
Burns argues that Neary is not a proper party and lacks standing to sue because the 
member of 2784 LLC is the Neary group, as opposed to Neary. He points to schedule A of 
the operating agreement (exhibit 2 to his motion papers), which lists the Neary group as 
consisting of three members with an 18.4% voting percentage interest, and the footnote to 
that schedule which states that the three Nearys (Neary, Salvatore, and Mary Ann) have 
each contributed 100% of their respective undivided interest as tenants in common in the 
2784 premises to 2784 LLC, and that "[t]he Neary Group owns an 18.4% Member Interest 
as a group," and "has appointed Mary Ann . . . to represent [***18] them in voting their 
total 18.4% Voting Percentage Interest until otherwise notified in writing by them." 
[1] Burns' argument must be rejected. The membership interest of the Nearys was referred 
to as the Neary group simply because their interest in the 2784 premises derived from 
Anna and thereafter passed to Neary and his two siblings, which ["876] formed the Neary 
group. The mere fact that Neary permitted Mary Ann to vote the collective 18.4% of the 
Neary group does not negate Neary's status as an individual member of 2784 LLC in his 
own individual right with a 6.133% (one third of 18.4%) ownership interest. Indeed, 
schedule A of the operating agreement lists Neary separately as a "Member' and sets 
forth his residence, address and Social Security number. In fact, Weary was an initial 
member of 2784 LLC at the time of its formation [*291] in 2006, and he signed the initial 
operating agreement and the amended and restated operating agreement as an "Initial 
Member" (see exhibit A to plaintiffs' opposition papers). Additionally, Neary, by an email 
dated February 24, 2010 (exhibit C to plaintiffs' opposition papers), gave Bums written 
notice of his intent to vote his own 6.133% membership interest separately. (***191 Thus, 
Neary has established that he is, in fact, an individual member of 2784 LLC and entitled to 
maintain this action in his own right without the joinder of the other members of the Neary 
group. 
Burns further asserts that Benevento is not a member of 2784 LLC, but, rather, the 
member is the estate of Julia. He argues that Benevento cannot claim a payment allegedly 
due to the estate of Julia. He states that while Benevento is a co-executor of the estate of 
Julia, he is not acting on behalf of the estate with his brother, Anthony, who is the co-
executor. 
[2] This argument by Burns is unavailing since Benevento is not making a claim on behalf 
of the estate of Julia, but in his own right as the holder of a beneficial interest of 9.2% of 
2784 LLC. Benevento does not seek to recover sums due to the estate of Julia. Rather, he 
seeks to recover distributions from the sale of the 2784 premises owed to him individually 
which, he claims, Burns wrongfully withheld from him by making deductions to his share of
