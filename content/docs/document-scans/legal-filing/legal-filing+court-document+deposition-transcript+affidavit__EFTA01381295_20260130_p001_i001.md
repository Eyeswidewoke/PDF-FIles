Market Segments 
There am no standard market segment definitions in the pet food industry. We segment pet foods into Wholesome Natural, Engineered, 
Private Label and Therapeutic market segment& This market segmentation is based on the ingredient profile of pet foods, with the exception of 
Private Label and Therapeutic pet foods, for the reasons discussed below. While others may segment the market in different ways, we believe this 
market segmentation is most helpful in understanding the industry and its market dynamics. 
Our definition of the Wholesome Natural market segment incorporates the AAFCO definition of "natural." but imposes further criteria 
based on the type of ingredients used to achieve nutritional targets. We believe this specific and ingredient-focused market segmentation reflects 
consumer preferences and how consumers make their purchase decisions, as evidenced by the disparity among the growth rates of the different 
market segments. While all BLUE products satisfy the criteria specified for the Wholesome Natural market segment described below, in order to 
account for variation in our competitors' portfolios of products. a pet food brand or product line is categorized in a particular market segment if 
90% or mom of the products under such brand or product line as measured by retail sales (rather than by volume) satisfy the market segment 
criteria specified. We define the market segments as follows: 
Wholesome Natural brands achieve their nutritional targets using only natural ingredients (as defined by AAFCO). and may 
include added vitamins, minerals and other trace nutrients. All Wholesome Natural dry foods have whole meats and/or meat meals. 
with the type of animal protein clearly identified, as their principal ingredients. Wholesome Natural products (dry foods, wet foods 
and treats) do not include chicken or poultry by-product meals, which we believe pet parents do not desire. Wholesome Natural 
products also do not rely on grain proteins, such as corn gluten meal, wheat gluten and soybean meal, as principal sources of 
protein as grain proteins have a narrower array of amino acids compared to animal proteins. In addition, these products also do not 
use corn, wheat, soy or fractionated grains, such as brewer's rice, as sources of starch. 
• 
Engineered brands achieve their nutritional targets without fulfilling all the requirements of the Wholesome Natural market 
segment. They typically do not contain whole meat or meat meal as their principal ingredients and/or they use lower cost proteins 
(such as chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal or wheat gluten) and lower-cost starches (such as corn, wheat or fractionated 
grains). Engineered products may or may not include artificial ingredients or preservatives. 
• 
Private Label brands are owned by retailers. While the vast majority of Private Label products fall within the Engineered market 
segment. some Private Label products fall within the Wholesome Natural market segment based on their ingredients. However. 
consistent with retail industry practice. market data providers do not identify the specific Private Label SKUs. As a vault. Private 
Label market segment sales are not categorized into either the Wholesome Natural or the Engineered market segment. 
• 
Therapeutic (Rx) brands are formulated to support treatment for certain medical conditions and are prescribed by veterinarians. 
Certain Therapeutic pet foods that claim to diagnose. cure. mitigate or prevent diseases are regulated by the FDA as animal drugs 
rather than as pet food. and are subject to FDA pm-market approval. In light of this regulatory process and the distinct Vet channel 
for the sale of Therapeutic pet foods. there is no Private Label participation in this market segment. 
We believe the Wholesome Natural and Therapeutic market segments are particularly on trend as pet parents increasingly treat their pets 
like family. With market shares of 17% and 7%. these two market segments have become significant parts of the U.S. pet food market, and 
continue to grow faster than the rest of the market.
