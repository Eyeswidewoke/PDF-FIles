This section includes the net market value of the securities in you account on a settlement date basis, including shod positions, at the close of the statement period. The market prices, unless otherwise noted, 
have been obtained from independent vendor services, which we believe to be reliable. Market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ from the actual sale price. Securities for which a price is 
not available are marked 'WA' and are omitted from the Total.

The pricing of securities on this statement may vary from their actual liquidation value. Prices shown should only be used as a general guide to portfolio value. Cash shown in this statement may not necessarily 
be available for investment due to unsettled transactions against your account(s). Prices for marketable securities are received from various pricing services thought to be reliable; however, pricing services are 
sometimes unable to provide timely information. Where pricing sources are not readily available, estimated prices may be used. When the updated price is received from the price provider, the updated price will 
be used in the release of the current month's statement. Prior statements will not be revised. You should always request a current valuation for your securities prior to making a financial decision or placing an 
order.

pricing of listed options takes into account the last closing price, as well as the current bid and offer prices.
