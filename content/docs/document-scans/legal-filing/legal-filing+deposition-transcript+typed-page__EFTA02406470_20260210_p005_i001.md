friend and ally, and as one that has devoted the l=st three years to making sure that Israel has additional security 
capabili=ies, and has worked to manage a series of difficult problems and questions over the past three years, I do=point 
out to them that we have a sanctions architecture that is far more e=fective than anybody anticipated; that we have a 
world that is about as un=ted as you get behind the sanctions; that our assessment, which is shared by the Israelis, is 
that Iran does no= yet have a nuclear weapon and is not yet in a position to obtain a nuclea= weapon without us having 
a pretty long lead time in which we will know th=t they are making that attempt. In that context, our argument is going 
to be that it is important for us t= see if we can solve this thing permanently, as opposed to temporarily. An= the only 
way, historically, that a country has ultimately decided not to =et nuclear weapons without constant military 
intervention has been when they themselves take [nuclear weapons]=off the table. That's what happened in Libya, 
that's what happened in Sout= Africa. And we think that, without in any way being under an illusion abo=t Iranian 
intentions, without in any way being naive about the nature of that regime, they are self-interes=ed. They recognize that 
they are in a bad, bad place right now. It is poss=ble for them to make a strategic calculation that, at minimum, pushes 
much=further to the right whatever potential breakout capacity they may have, and that may turn out to be the best 
deci=ion for Israel's security. These are difficult questions, and again, if I =ere the prime minister of Israel, I'd be 
wrestling with them. As president=of the United States, I wrestle with them as well. 
GOLDBERG: Could you shed some light on your relationship with the pr=me minister? You've met with him more than 
with any other world leader. It=s assumed that you have a dysfunctional relationship. What is it like? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I actually think the relationship is very functiona=, and the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The 
fact of the matter is= we've gotten a lot of business done with Israel over the last three years= I think the prime minister 
-- and certainly the defense minister -- would acknowledge that we've never h=d closer military and intelligence 
cooperation. When you look at what I've=done with respect to security for Israel, from joint training and joint ex=rcises 
that outstrip anything that's been done in the past, to helping finance and construct the Iron Dome prog=am to make 
sure that Israeli families are less vulnerable to missile strik=s, to ensuring that Israel maintains its qualitative military 
edge, to fig=ting back against delegitimization of Israel, whether at the [UN] Human Rights Council, or in front of the 
UN=General Assembly, or during the Goldstone Report, or after the flare-up in=olving the flotilla -- the truth of the 
matter is that the relationship ha= functioned very well. 
GOLDBERG: Are you friends? Do you talk about things other than busin=ss? 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, the truth of the matter is, both of us ha=e so much on our plates that there's not always 
a lot of time to have disc=ssions beyond business. Having said that, what I think is absolutely true =s that the prime 
minister and I come out of different political traditions. This is one of the few times i= the history of U.S.-Israeli relations 
where you have a government from th= right in Israel at the same time you have a center-left government in the=United 
States, and so I think what happens then is that a lot of political interpretations of our relationshi= get projected onto 
this. But one thing that I have found in working with =rime Minister Netanyahu is that we can be very frank with each 
other, very=blunt with each other, very honest with each other. For the most part, when we have differences, they are 
tac=ical and not strategic. Our objectives are a secure United States, a secur= Israel, peace, the capacity for our kids to 
grow up in safety and securit= and not have to worry about bombs going off, and being able to promote business and 
economic growth and comm=rce. We have a common vision about where we want to go. At any given momen= -- as is 
true, frankly, with my relationship with every other foreign lea=er -- there's not going to be perfect alignment of how we 
achieve these objectives. 
GOLDBERG: In an interview three years ago, right before he became pr=me minister, Netanyahu told me 
<http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/03/netanyahu-to=obama-stop-iran-or-i-will/7390/> that he 
believes Iran is being run by a "messian=c apocalyptic cult." Last week, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman =f the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. referred to the Iranian leadership as "r=tional." Where do you fall on this continuum? Do you feel 
that the leaders of Iran might be so irrational that they will=not act in what we would understand to be their self-
interest?
