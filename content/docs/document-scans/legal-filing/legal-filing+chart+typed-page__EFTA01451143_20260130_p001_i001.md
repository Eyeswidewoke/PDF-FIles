FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
• 
Norges bank to continue to balance falling house 
prices vs. sticky CPI. 
• 
NOK cheap, but investors wary of jumping back in 
unless/until Norges Bank and/or crude provide 
support supportive. 
In Norway, the mainland economy has been growing 
around 2.0-2.5% YoY for most of the last couple of 
years, with the recent PMI and manufacturing output 
suggestive of continuing improvement going forward. 
Norges Bank's focus is balancing the declining housing 
market against sticky inflation at the consumer level. 
With house prices having slowed to largely flat on the 
year, representing a 3-3.5% drop from the peak in Q3 
last year, and headline CPI back in line with the Bank's 
2.5% target (from 3.2% YoY in August), Norges Bank is 
erring on the dovish side, arguing that the rise in (core] 
inflation is transitory. Indeed, according to the Bank's 
projections, core inflation is expected to drift back up 
over the next few months, reaching a peak just above 
the inflation target of 2.6% in April/May, before 
dropping down and remaining just below 2% up until 
the end of 2015. House prices meanwhile, are seen 
slowing further, to -2.5% to -3.O% YoY in HI 2014, 
before returning to positive YoY growth in early 2015. 
The risk to Norges Banks's finely balanced outlook for 
inflation and housing is twofold. First is a scenario in 
which past and current FX weakness feeds through to 
imported 
inflation, 
thus 
preventing 
core 
from 
moderating in line with Norges forecasts. If the Bank 
then feels compelled to hike rates at a time when 
house prices already are declining, that would 
exacerbate the decline and not be currency supportive. 
An alternative risk scenario is if the house price falls 
feeds on themselves. With policy rates already as low 
as 1.50%, and with core CPI projected at or above 
target over the next 3.6 months, there would be limited 
scope for policy to provide a stopgap. While the above 
scenarios are not our baseline, they will continue to be 
a key factor in the Norges Bank's decision-making 
process, with monetary policy likely to be stuck 
between a fear of adding to the decline in house prices 
on one hand and sticky inflation on the other. 
Meanwhile crude is likely to continue to flatline in the 
relatively tight $90 to $110 range of the past few years. 
Monetary policy and crude are therefore unlikely to 
provide much in terms of direction in the NOK. 
However, 
given recent depreciation cannot 
be 
explained by fundamentals, with the Norwegian unit 
arguably oversold even when taking into account the 
market's now very dovish outlook for Norges Bank 
policy and flat oil prices, we are cautiously constructive. 
On balance we anticipate very gradual downside in 
EUR/NOK from current levels. A 3m EUR/NOK put @ 
8.25 costs an indicative 76bp. Alternatively, finance it 
by selling a 3m EUR/NOK 8.65 call.
