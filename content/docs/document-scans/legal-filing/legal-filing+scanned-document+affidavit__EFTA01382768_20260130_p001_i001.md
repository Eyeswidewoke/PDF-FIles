Stockholders' Derivative Actions 
Under the DGCL, any of our stockholders may bring an action in our name to procure a judgment in our favor, also known as a 
derivative action, provided that the stockholder bringing the action is a holder of our shares at the time of the transaction to which the action relates 
or such stockholder's stock thereafter devolved by operation of law. 
Exclusive Forum 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, subject to limited exception, that unless we consent to the selection 
of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum 
for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our Company. (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by 
any director, officer, or other employee or stockholder of our Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders, creditors or other 
constituents, (iii) action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the 
DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or as to which the DUCT. confers jurisdiction 
on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer of the Company 
governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable 
parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of our company 
shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, the 
enforceability of similar forum provisions in other companies' certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings. and it is 
possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be unenforceable. 
Conflicts of Interest 
Delaware law permits corporations to adopt provisions renouncing any interest or expectancy in certain opportunities that are presented 
to the corporation or its officers, directors or stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will, to the maximum extent 
permitted from time to time by Delaware law, renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in, or right to be offered an opportunity to 
participate in. specified business opportunities that are from time to time presented to our officers, directors or stockholders or their respective 
affiliates, other than those officers, directors, stockholders or affiliates who are our or our subsidiaries' employees. Our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation will provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of KKR or any director who is not employed by us 
(including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will 
have no duty to refrain from (i) engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar lines of business in which we or our affiliates now 
engage or propose to engage or (ii) otherwise competing with us or our affiliates. In addition, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in the event that 
KKR or any non-employee director acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity which may be a corporate 
opportunity for itself or himself or its or his affiliates or for us or our affiliates, such person will have no duty to communicate or offer such 
transaction or business opportunity to us or any of our affiliates and they may take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to another person 
or entity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not renounce our interest in any business opportunity that is expressly offered 
to a non-employee director solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no business 
opportunity will be deemed to be a potential corporate opportunity for us unless we would be permitted to undertake the opportunity under our 
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have sufficient financial resources to undertake the opportunity and the opportunity would he 
in line with our business. 
Limitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors
