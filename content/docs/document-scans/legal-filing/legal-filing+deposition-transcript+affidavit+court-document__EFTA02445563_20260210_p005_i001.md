After receiving this letter, Kennedy renewed his motion for a temporary restraining order and 
preliminary injunction to prohibit the Parole Commission from requiring him to register as a sex 
offender, challenging the constitutionality of SORNA in various respects and arguing that 
SORNA did not apply to him because Maryland law did not require him to register. In response, 
the Parole Commission agreed to delay enforcing its requirement that Kennedy register as a sex 
offender until after the district court ruled on Kennedy's habeas petition and motion for an 
injunction. 
Thereafter, the district court denied both Kennedy's habeas petition and his motion for an 
injunction, explaining that SORNA's "clear and unequivocal requirement that individuals 
convicted of sex offenses must register as sex offenders under federal law" applied to him even 
though Maryland had not yet filly implemented SORNA, noting that Maryland has a registry in 
which Kennedy could register. Kennedy v. Allen, No. 1:05-CV-00129-BEL, slip op. at 5 (D. 
Md. June 10, 2008). The court also summarily rejected Kennedy's constitutional and statutory 
challenges to SORNA, explaining that "[t]hese arguments have been considered and consistently 
rejected by courts across the country, all of which have confirmed the constitutionality of 
SORNA and the regulations associated with it. The Court concurs in these analyses and will not 
belabor these points here." Id. at 6-7 (citations omitted). Finally, the court found significant the 
fact that "[a]s Kennedy acknowledges, the Commission has broad authority to impose conditions 
on his parole that are reasonably related to his offense and personal characteristics." Id. at 7. It 
concluded that Kennedy thus cannot avoid the condition that he " 'report for registration with 
[his] state sex offender registration agency as directed by [his] U.S. Probation Officer.' " Id. 
(quoting Kennedy's parole conditions). 
From the entry of the district court's order, dated June 10, 2008, Kennedy appealed to this court. 
He also reported to the Wicomico County Sheriffs Office to be registered as a sex offender, and 
the Sheriffs Office accepted his registration. Kennedy is now registered in the Maryland sex 
offender registry. 
By an earlier unpublished opinion, we affirmed the district court's order, concluding that 
Kennedy's challenges to SORNA made no difference because he was independently required by 
Maryland law to register as a sex offender. See Kennedy v. Allen, No. 08-8513, 361 F. App'x 
442, 44345 (4th Cir. Oct. 22, 2009). 
On November 2, 2009, Kennedy filed a petition for rehearing, arguing that we had misinterpreted 
Maryland law in holding that Maryland law required him to register as a sex offender. Kennedy 
argued that under Maryland law, sex offenders whose offenses were committed prior to July 1, 
1997, are only required to register if they were previously subject to registration requirements in 
another State or were under the supervision of a "supervising authority" on October 1, 2001, 
and that he did not fall within the terms of these provisions because he had never been required 
to register in another State and because the U.S. Parole Commission was not included in the 
statutory definition of "supervising authority." By an order dated March 4, 2010, we granted 
Kennedy's petition for rehearing.
