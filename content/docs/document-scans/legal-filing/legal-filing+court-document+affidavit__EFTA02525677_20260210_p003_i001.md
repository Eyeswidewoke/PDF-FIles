In 2012, as part of a =ormal review of its internal policies, the institute 
made a decision =hat you would not be invited to return. 
I believe this final claim is false, and I would like =onfirmation from you. It may 
be a fine point, but I believe it is =mportant. Originally Michael informed me immediately after the =vent in 2009 that 
there was a complaint of inappropriate =ommunication with one of the staff--something I still dispute--but be =hat as it 
may, he informed me by email that I shoudn't =ommunicate with the staff I had interacted with at the time, and the 
=atter was then considered closed. Several years later I was =nvited to give another public lecture but your outreach 
coordinator =ater rescinded the invitation, although I was reimbursed for that. =nbsp;As you are aware, I subsequently 
discussed my concern about this =ith Neil in Vancouver in that year, and inquired about exactly what it =as all about, and 
informed him that either a formal procedure to resolve any issue in which I could participate and respond might be 
=ppropriate, or the matter should be dropped. Neil said he would explore =he matter, and neither he, nor anyone else, 
ever contacted me following =hat. I have never been informed of anything like Buzzfeed has =laimed. Indeed I have 
been invited back to Perimeter for scientific =eetings by various colleagues in the intervening years. I =ould find it 
highly irregular if any formal procedure took place with =uch an outcome without my knowledge or without any due 
process, and =ithout subsequently informing me, and all evidence I have suggests the =ontrary. 
I am very concerned by this claim below, for obvious reasons. =nbsp;First, the 
original Perimeter source provided false and defamatory =nformation to Buzzfeed, changing a story only after I provided 
=ounter-evidence. 
The accurate history if there is one, is =hat there was a complaint from someone at Perimeter 
about inappropriate =ommunication and that 3 years later a decision was made by the =utreach coordinator, perhaps in 
collaboration with others, not to =nvite me back at that time for a public lecture. I would like to =ave your confirm for 
me that Buzzfeed's claim is incorrect a it =tands I would prefer to leave it at that, but if necessary one =ould add that 
there was a report of inappropriate communication with an =mployee at the event at the time, which I disputed and the 
matter was =losed. 
Please =onfirm my understanding of this issue for me if you will. As you =an 
imagine, making this public is embarrassing for me, Buzzfeed =as tried, at every turn, to misrepresent facts in the worst 
possible =ight, it is important for me to not allow them to continue to do this =ith impunity. For example, they 
contacted my university and asked =f there any claims fo sexual harassment against me, and though the =niversity 
explicitly replied there were none from the University, but =hat there was an external allegation about a remote event 
that the =niversity had investigated and had discredited (the one I mentioned =bove) and about which they would 
therefore not provide further =nformation, Buzzfeed informed me that they intended to report that they =ontacted the 
University with a request for information about sexual =arassment allegations at ASU and that the University would not 
give =hem any information. 
Last, while it would not ber surprising if Buzzfeed has =eiinterpeted statements 
from Perimeter staff just to elicit a response, =ut if a member of your staff made the original false allegation to =uzzfeed 
(violating confidentiality in the process I expect) I wanted =ou to be aware of this possibility, and if necessary act 
=ccordingly. 
I really appreciate your prompt attention to this =equest.
