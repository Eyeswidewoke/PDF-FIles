agree to notify us promptly of any changes. 
• 
No one other than you, and the individuals identified to UBS in connection with the

us in writing and UBS Financial Services Inc. agrees to continue to carry the Account.

All of the personal and financial information you have supplied to UBS is true and 
accurate, and you will notify UBS promptly of any material changes, particularly the

If you are acting as executor, trustee, conservator, guardian or custodian: 
— You understand that you are a fiduciary on behalf of the beneficial owners 
of the Account and that you have a duty to use the services and features 
provided through the Account for the benefit of the beneficial owners of 
the Account and not for your own benefit. 
— You acknowledge that you will make an independent determination that 
any activity in the Account is suitable and appropriate for the beneficial 
owners and that the compensation we receive is reasonable. 
— You understand and agree that this determination is solely your 
responsibility and not ours.
