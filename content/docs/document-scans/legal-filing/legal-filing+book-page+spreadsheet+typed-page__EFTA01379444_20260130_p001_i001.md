2018: The boost of synchronized growth 
We believe EM FX can perform well through 2018 but 
with total return just short of 5% (neer 7% in LatAm. 
4.5% in EMEA and 3% in ASial absent the USD boost 
of 2017. We are constructive for several reasons. 
I. Global growth is turning more supportive and 
synchronized; Portfolio inflows are pro-cyclical 
on growth (particularly in equities); 
2. EM EX valuations are attractive for the most 
part; as output gaps narrow arid external 
vulnerabilities remain contained. monetary 
policy may tighten. 
1. The boost from growth and flows 
EM currencies tend to perform well during txlri(xis of 
global growth accelei.,,Er,r1 
^,;y)c.ilv>riiratv,r1 This is 
the pattern we expect to consolidate over the next 
year. Not only we expect global growth to inch up to a 
sound 3.9% (with EM up to 4.9%), but we also see 
reduced dispersion across the global economy. The 
shaded areas in the chart below mark periods of EM FX 
appreciation vs. the USD and they coincide with 
periods of increased growth with synchronization as 
we forecast for the coming year. 
After all this 
backdrop is associated with narrowing gaps, less 
stimulative monetary policies in EM, stronger trade and 
capital flows - all positive externalities for FX.

below shows, higher EM growth relative to DM is 
associated with inflows into EM. This is particularly the 
case in LatAm, where the recovery has lagged the 
other EM regions but is set to accelerate in 2018.

(according to EPFR). As we have discussed in related 
publications, EM inflows are most sensitive to the USD 
cycle and growth and the latter should tame the impact 
of tightening US liquidity on EM FX. In contrast with 
usual perceptions, the correlations between EM flows 
and core CB balance sheets or yields tend to be erratic 
and small for the most part. Also, the investment cycle 
seems to be gaining steam, which brings more global 
trade - another boost for currencies.
