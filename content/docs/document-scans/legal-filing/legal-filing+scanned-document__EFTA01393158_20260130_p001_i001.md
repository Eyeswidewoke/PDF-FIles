will fix a new settlement date after OCC determines that 
the exercise settlement value is available or after OCC 
fixes the cash settlement amount. 
If OCC determines to fix the cash settlement 
amount, it will act through an adjustment panel that will 
use its judgment as to what is appropriate for the protec-
tion of Investors and the public interest. For a description 
of adjustment panels, see "Adjustment and Adjustment 
Panels" in Chapter II. The panel may fix the cash settle-
ment amount using the reported value of the underlying 
yield Q) at the close of regular trading hours (as deter-
mined by OCC) on the last preceding trading day for 
which such a value was reported by the reporting author-
ity or (ii) at the opening of regular trading hours (as deter-
mined by OCC) on the next trading day for which such a 
value was reported by the reporting authority. Alterna-
tively, the panel may fix the cash settlement amount 
using the value for the underlying yield, or using a combi-
nation or average of such values. at or during such time 
or times that the panel sees fit. 
If an adjustment panel delays fixing a cash settle-
ment amount for a series of yield-based options past the 
last trading day before expiration of that series, normal 
expiration exercise procedures will not apply to the 
affected series. Instead, exercise settlement will be post-
poned until the next business day following the day when 
the adjustment panel fixes the cash settlement amount. 
and each long position in the affected series will be 
treated as having been exercised if the cash settlement 
amount per contract for that series is $1.00 or more. If the 
cash settlement amount per contract is less than $1.00. 
the option will be treated as having expired unexercised. 
As a result of these procedures, holders of expiring yield-
based options may not know whether their options have 
been exercised, and writers of such options may not 
know whether they have been assigned an exercise 
notice, until after the expiration date. An adjustment 
panel's determinations shall be conclusive. binding on all 
investors, and not subject to review. 
Part VII. Erroneously Reported Index Levels. 
The paragraph numbered 5. on page 76 is replaced 
with the following paragraph, which omits a statement 
that a person who buys or sells an index option at a 
premium based on an erroneously reported index level is 
bound by the trade and has no remedy. The omission 
reflects the adoption of rules by certain options markets 
that permit, in very limited circumstances, the cancella-
tion or adjustment of a transaction entered into at a pre-
mium based on an erroneously reported value for the 
underlying Interest: 
5. 
Holders and writers of index options generally 
bear the risk that the reported current index level may be 
in error. Persons who exercise cash-settled index options 
or are assigned exercises based on erroneously reported 
index levels will ordinarily be required to make settlement 
based on the exercise settlement value as initially
