Nov. 08, 20120 <http://world.time.com/2012/11/08/the-anti-assad-offensive-can-t=e-west-oust-syrias-
strongmaniticomments> -- Scarcely hours after his re-election, President Obama was under pressur= from U.S. allies to 
take stronger action on Syria <http://topics.time.com/syria/> .=Britain's Prime Minister =span style="font-
size:18.0pt">David Cameron <http://topics.time.com/david-cameron/> told reporters on Nov. 7, during a visit to a 
Syrian refuge= camp in Jordan, that "one of the first things I want to talk to Barack about is how we must do more to try 
and so=ve this crisis." French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius added to the cla=or on Nov. 8, telling reporters he planned 
to call for more urgency from W=shington on Syria at a planned meeting later in the day with Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton <http://topics.t=me.com/hillary-clintonk , promising th=t the message would be reinforced by "swift and 
necessary" talks between President Francois Hollande and Obama. On=Syria, said Fabius, "The Americans have recently 
been in the background = little." 
Some hope that the =bama Administration may be less risk-averse in the wake of the election an= possibly more inclined 
to arm Syria's rebels. Until now, the U.S. has o=fered only nonlethal support to Syria's disparate rebel groups, largely for 
fear that weapons could end up in the =ands of elements — which make up a substantial part of the Syrian insurg=ncy 
— hostile to U.S. interests and allies in the region. While such con=erns remain, "there is now less risk aversion," 
believes Shashank Joshi, a research fellow at the Royal Unite= Services Institute, a defense think tank in London. 
"Before, if the wea=ons got into the wrong hands in October and turned on the Turkish forces, =or example, all those 
things would have been hugely embarrassing for the Administration at a moment when they=wanted to avoid all risk," 
he says. "It is less important that Obama h=s won than that someone has won." 
There are still anx=eties about arms being turned against U.S. interests, including possibly i= future attacks against Israel. 
And yet the anti-Assad offensive is intens=fying. Cameron seemed to move ahead of his more cautious U.S. allies this 
week, announcing on Nov. 7 that Brit=in would open direct ties with Syrian rebel leaders, which was interpreted=by 
many as opening the way to more military support for the insurgency. 
A Libya-style Weste=n military intervention remains highly unlikely, partly because Russia and=China would deny such 
an operation legal authority in the U.N. Security Co=ncil and partly out of fear of being drawn into an open-ended civil 
war that has already spilled over Syria's=borders into Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey. Lesser forms of intervention, such =s 
training and equipping rebel groups or enforcing a no-fly zone over terr=tory they control, would still require substantial 
military commitment from Western forces. "The British don'= want to do this unilaterally, without trying to get the 
Americans on boar=," says Salman Shaikh, an analyst at the Brookings Doha Center. "Camer=n will try to get Obama to 
step up." 
But whether Cameron= Hollande or anyone else can persuade Obama to commit U.S. assets to a mor= direct role in the 
Syrian conflict remains to be seen. The British Prime =inister and his fellow Western leaders would prefer that the 
problem simply go away, in the form of Syrian Presid=nt Bashar Assad's accepting defeat and choosing exile. Midway 
through hi= Middle East trip, Cameron told al-Arabiya television in Abu Dhabi that le=ders were desperate for "anything, 
anything, to get that man out of the country," adding, "I am certainly=not offering him an exit plan to Britain, but if he 
wants to leave he coul= leave. That could be arranged." 
Not that easily, of=course, given that even Cameron later added that he supports the call for =ssad to face charges at the 
International Criminal Court for his role in u=leashing the violence that has claimed upward of 20,000 Syrian lives over 
the past 18 months. The prospect of an =CC indictment and life in prison would remove any incentive for Assad to 
a=cept defeat. Says Joshi: "If you don't drop the idea of the ICC indict=ent, why would he ever leave?" 
Not that Assad sees=any reason to pack his bags, having retained the support of his key backer=, Russia and Iran, and 
effectively fighting the rebellion to a military st=lemate — albeit one that leaves him in control of much less of Syria than 
he was two years ago. The Syrian str=ngman has already rejected two proposals, one from Tunisian President Monc=f 
Marzouki last April and the second from the Arab League in July, for saf= passage abroad. Asked during a Russia Today 
television interview on Thursday whether he might leave the c=untry, Assad fumed, "I am Syrian. I was made in Syria. I 
have to live in=Syria and die in Syria."
