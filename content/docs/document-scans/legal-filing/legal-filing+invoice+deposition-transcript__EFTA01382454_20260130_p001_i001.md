Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of February 28, 2015. February 20, 2014 and February 21, 2013 are tax 
positions of $221.6 million, $103.0 million and $32.4 million, respectively, which would reduce the Company's effective tax rate if 
recognized in future periods. Of the $221.6 million that could impact tax expense, the Company has recorded $12.8 million of 
indemnification assets that would offset any future recognition. As of February 28, 2015, the Company is no longer subject to federal 
income tax examinations for the fiscal years prior to 2007, and in most states, is no longer subject to state income tax examinations for 
fiscal years before 2007. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component 
of income tax expense. The Company recognized expense (benefit) related to interest and penalties, net of settlement adjustments, of 
$(1.2) million, $(5.9) million and $7.0 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company does not expect any material 
amount of unrecognized tax benefits to reverse in the next 12 months. 
Note 14—Employee Benefit Plans and Collective Bargaining Agreements 
Pension Plans 
The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan (the "Shaw's Plan") covering union employees under the Shaw's banner. 
The Company also sponsors a defined benefit pension plan (the "Safeway Plan") for substantially all of its employees under the Safeway 
banners not participating in multiemployer pension plans. The Company also sponsors a frozen plan covering certain employees under 
the United banners and a Retirement Restoration Plan that provides death benefits and supplemental income payments for certain 
senior executives after retirement. The Retirement Restoration Plan is unfunded. 
The Safeway Plan and the Retirement Restoration Plan were acquired as part of the Safeway acquisition in fiscal 2014. The 
United Plan was acquired as part of the United acquisition in fiscal 2013. 
Other Post-Retirement Benefits 
In addition to the Company's pension plans, the Company acquired plans as part of the Safeway acquisition that provide post-
retirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees. Retirees share a portion of the cost of the post-retirement medical 
plans. The Company pays all the cost of the life insurance plans. The plans are unfunded.
