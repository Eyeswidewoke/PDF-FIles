2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129842, * 
substantial, showing continuous and systematic contacts between the defendant and the 
forum state. Meier, 288 F.3d at 1274 (11th Cir. 2002). Specific jurisdiction exists when 
defendant's contacts with the forum: (1) are related to the cause of action; (2) involve 
some act by which the defendant purposefully availed itself of the benefits of the forum; 
and (3) are such that the defendant should reasonably anticipate being sued in the forum 
state. Francosteel Corp. v. MN Charm, 19 F.3d 624, 627 (11th Cir. 2007). "The availability 
of specific jurisdiction depends on the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and 
the litigation." Borg-Warner Acceptance Corp. v. Lovett & Tharpe, Inc., 786 F.2d 1055, 
1057 (11th Cir. 1986). 
Defendant contends it lacks sufficient minimum contacts to warrant personal jurisdiction in 
the state of Georgia. Defendant is not registered to do business in Georgia and does not 
maintain an office, telephone listing, mailing address, or business location in Georgia. 
(Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 2). Defendant sells its products only to authorized dealers and 
distributors, who then sell the products to consumers. r5] (Id. at 3). Though it concedes 
some of those dealers and distributors are located in Georgia, defendant maintains that its 
sale to those agents merely places their products into the stream of commerce. (Id. at 14). 
Moreover, defendant argues that, even if valid, the employment contract with plaintiff is 
insufficient to establish specific jurisdiction. 
The court finds that defendant established minimum contacts with Georgia sufficient to 
support specific personal jurisdiction. This claim arises out of a breach of an employment 
contract allegedly entered into between the parties. The contract provides that plaintiff 
serve as defendant's regional sales manager, and plaintiff states that the purpose of his 
employment was to increase defendant's sales in Georgia and other southeastern states.' 
(Ex. A to Pl.'s Resp. 1). The contract, therefore, was to be performed, at least in part, 
within Georgia. At all times during his employment, plaintiff resided in Georgia. (Id.) As 
regional sales manager, plaintiff contacted defendant's customers, and defendant paid 
plaintiffs salary for the performance of his duties. (Ex. B to Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 3). 
Nonetheless, defendant now argues that it did not "voluntarily accept [" 6] the . . . 
employment contract." (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 19). Given the almost two-year professional 
relationship between the parties, the court finds defendant's attempts to distance itself 
from the contract unpersuasive. 
1 The court notes that the parties hotly contest the validity of the employment agreement. In evaluating defendant's motion to 
dismiss, however, the court must construe all inferences in favor of plaintiff. Meier, 286 F.3d at 1269; Madara. 916 F.2d at 1514. 
Defendant maintains it could not have anticipated plaintiffs Georgia residence because the 
employment agreement required him to relocate to Virginia. Under a section entitled 
"Compensation and Benefits," the employment agreement provides that defendant "shall 
reimburse [plaintiff] for the reasonable costs and expense . . . incurred . . in relocating to 
the location of [defendant's] headquarters." (Ex. A to Pl.'s Compl. 2). No other language in 
the contract, however, mandates that plaintiff move to Marion, Virginia, and plaintiff states 
defendant never asked him to relocate. (Ex. A to Pl.'s Resp. 2). The court finds that this 
ambiguous contractual provision does not mitigate defendant's contacts with Georgia.
