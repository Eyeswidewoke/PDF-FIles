States, and to sow chaos and confusion." The strategy "not only allows Iran to retaliate for what 
it sees as similar efforts by the U.S. government on Iran, but it also helps Iran discredit 
democracy as a system of government." Tabatabai concludes that fighting "over which 
candidate Iran wants to boost or hurt, rather than focusing on how to respond in a unified way 
to these threats, will only play into Tehran's hands." 
States Increase IT Support For Elections Organizers As Systems Move Online. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/22, Loten, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that more 
states are shifting election-system services - such as online voter registration, absentee ballot 
applications, and more - online, according to National Association of Secretaries of State 
President Maggie Toulouse Oliver. As a result, more IT workers will be needed to handle 
complex issues such as network outages or cybersecurity threats. According to National 
Association of State Chief Information Officers Executive Director Doug Robinson, many states 
are providing indirect support for their elections agencies through capabilities such as 
provisioning IT infrastructure and cybersecurity. For instance, Connecticut and Ohio have both 
increased their cybersecurity training and infrastructure, including offering assistance to local 
elections organizers from the National Guard. 
Wisconsin Officials Urge Voters To Ignore "Noise" About Election Interference And 
vote. 
WDJT-TV Milwaukee (10/22, 65K) reports that Wisconsin officials "expressed confidence in the 
security of their systems following National Intelligence and the FBI confirming foreign 
interference in the U.S. election." Wisconsin Elections Commission administrator Meagan Wolfe 
said on Thursday, "There is no evidence that Wisconsin's or any state's systems have been 
accessed or compromised in any way." UW-Madison political science professor commented, "I'm 
glad that the FBI and DNI alerted the public before the election." Kim added, "I think that there 
might be a lot of disinformation campaigns, especially on social media so voters should be 
alerted about that." 
India, US To Negotiate Deal For Access To Satellite Data During Pompeo Visit. 
Reuters (10/22, Miglani, Ghoshal) reports that a potential deal between the US and India would 
give the latter "access to satellite data for better accuracy of missiles and drones, government 
and industry officials said, as it tries to narrow the gap with the powerful Chinese military." The 
two countries "are expected to announce the pact during the visit next week" of Secretary of 
State Pompeo and Defense Secretary Esper "for talks in New Delhi with Indian counterparts 
Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh." The US "has also been pushing for stronger 
security ties with India to help balance China's growing regional influence." A deal "would 
provide India with access to a range of topographical, nautical and aeronautical data," and 
"allow the United States to provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on U.S.-supplied 
aircraft to India." An unnamed defense industry source said, "It is a foundational agreement, 
which the U.S. has signed with many of its partners for greater interoperability." 
Filing: Garrison Courtney Almost Won Legal Immunity. 
The Daily Beast (10/22, 1.39M) reports, "A sentencing memo filed in federal court" by the DOJ 
"reveals for the first time the full extent of fake spy Garrison Courtney's stunning ruse." He 
"came `dangerously close' to getting a legal sign-off that could have made it impossible for 
prosecutors to bring him to justice, authorities said in the new filing." Courtney also personally 
extracted "$4.4 million...from his victims over the course of more than four years," and "was in 
line for nearly $4 billion in Army, Navy, and Air Force contracts had the FBI not caught him." 
Courtney, "served as a high-level spokesperson" for the DEA "before embarking on his criminal 
career, pleaded guilty this summer to one count of wire fraud."
