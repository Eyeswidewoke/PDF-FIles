interests, in connection with acquisitions of property or otherwise, which could have priority over 
Common Units with respect to distributions from our operating partnership, including the Common 
Units we own. 
Redemption Rights 
Any future limited partners, other than us or our subsidiaries, will receive redemption rights, which 
will enable them to cause our operating partnership, on or after the date that is 12 months from the 
date of issuance of a Common Unit to a limited partner, to redeem all or a portion of the Common 
Units held by such limited partner in exchange for cash, or at our option, for shares of our common 
stock on a one-for-one basis. The cash redemption amount per Common Unit would be based on the 
market price of our common stock at the time of redemption. 
number of shares of our common 
stock issuable upon redemption of Common Units held by limited partners may be adjusted upon the 
occurrence of certain events such as stock dividends, stock subdivisions or combinations. We expect to 
fund cash redemptions, if any, out of available cash and/or borrowings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
a limited partner will not be entitled to exercise its redemption rights if the delivery of common stock 
to the redeeming limited partner would cause: 
• the redeeming partner or any other person to violate any of the restrictions on ownership and 
transfer or our stock contained in our charter; 
• a termination of our operating partnership for U.S. federal or state income tax purposes (except 
as a result of the redemption of all units other than those owned by us); 
• our operating partnership to cease to be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes (except as a result of the redemption of all units other than those owned by us); 
• our operating partnership to become, with respect to any employee benefit plan subject to 
Title I of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, a "party-in-interest"(as 
defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA) or a "disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975(e) of 
the Code); 
• any portion of the assets of our operating partnership to constitute assets of any employee 
benefit plan pursuant to Department of Labor Regulations Section 2510.2-101; 
• our operating partnership to become a "publicly traded partnership," as such term is defined in 
Section 7704(b) of the Code, that is taxable as a corporation for US. federal income tax 
purposes; 
• our operating partnership to be regulated under the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 
1940. as amended, or ERISA: or 
• an adverse effect on our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT or, except with our consent, 
cause any taxes to become payable by us under Section 857 or Section 4981 of the Code. 
Reimbursement of Expenses 
in addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by our operating 
partnership, our operating partnership generally will pay all of our administrative costs and expenses, 
including: 
• all expenses relating to our formation and continuity of existence and operation: 
• all expenses relating to offerings, registrations and repurchases of securities:
