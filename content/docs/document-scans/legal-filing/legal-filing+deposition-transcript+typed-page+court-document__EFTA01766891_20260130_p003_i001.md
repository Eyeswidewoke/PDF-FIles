* By falling on his sword, Mr Diamond has created the possibility of a rapprochement between his 
former bank and British political opinion formers. The bigger issue for the bank he leaves behind and others like it is how 
— or if — it is possible after the crisis to rebuild political and regulatory confidence in the kind of financial markets 
businesses he dedicated his career to building and the people who run and profit from them. 
Bob Diamond's resignation as Chief Executive of Barclays bank clearly marks a turning point in the 
politics of banking in the UK. The announcement that Barclay's was to be fined E290mn as part of a settlement with the 
FSA financial regulator over its part in the fixing of the London interbank lending rate between 2005 and 2008 proved 
the tipping point for Mr Diamond. The Barclay's CEO has long been the most controversial of Britain's bank leaders and 
had few political friends. Yet in the end, the trigger for his resignation was not direct political pressure, but the FSA's 
intimation to the Barclay's board that unattributed threats from the top of Barclays to the Bank of England had made 
Barclays' relationship with its regulator potentially toxic. 
Mr Diamond's departure and the LIBOR-fixing scandal will mark the start of a new phase in the politics 
of the banking crisis in Britain. The suggestion that traders at Barclays and other banks were manipulating what is 
ultimately a key public benchmark for pricing financial products compounds a run of mis-selling and tax planning 
controversies. With a Parliamentary enquiry now to take place on the LIBOR issue in the UK, and the issue likely to ripple 
across other jurisdictions and produce both litigation and possible prosecutions, banks in the UK are confronted with 
new levels of political and public disdain. The fact that the Bank of England's own conduct remains subject to question in 
some aspects of the LIBOR scandal will not deflect from this. 
It is safe to assume that the setting of LIBOR will now be moved into the remit of the UK financial 
regulator. Brussels will tighten market abuse rules to apply criminal sanctions to tampering with indices like LIBOR. But 
the most significant political and regulatory outcome from these events will be to renew the debate about universal 
banking. Where this debate has to this point focused on scale, implicit subsidy and systemic risk, it will now focus on 
culture, personal character and contamination from the values of the trading floor to the rest of a banking institution. 
Because these things cannot be regulated, the probability is that politicians will focus on their political proxies, especially 
pay. 
The return of Vickers 
The link between what has happened at Barclays and the universal banking argument is trust. Preserving 
the universal bank model relies on public trust that the core retail functions of a bank and its trading activities can be 
properly and completely segregated. The UK Independent Commission on Banking chaired by Sir John Vickers proposed 
in 2011 that they could be preserved in a single institution but in separate entities, with the retail functions ringfenced 
with their own higher capital levels. The Vickers Commission recommended that all derivatives services should be kept 
outside this ringfence. 
The UK government accepted the argument that retail banks should be able to maintain some simple 
derivatives functions such as products for hedging currency risk for business clients. The Barclays experience is already
