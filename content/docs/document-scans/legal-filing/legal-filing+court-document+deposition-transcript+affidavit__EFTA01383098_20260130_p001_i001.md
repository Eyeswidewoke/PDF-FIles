Servicing Fee in respect of each DB Introduced Person will be equal to the product of the 
amount of such DB Introduced Person's allocable share (based upon Subscriptions) of the 
Access Fund's Invested Capital, multiplied by: 
a. 
if the aggregate Subscription of such DB Introduced Person to the Access Fund is 
less than $3 million, 0.4875% per annum; 
b. 
if the aggregate Subscription of such DB Introduced Person to the Access Fund is 
equal to $3 million or more but less than $5 million, 0.36% per annum; and 
c. 
if the aggregate Subscription of such DB Introduced Person to the Access Fund is 
equal to or greater than $5 million, 0.05% per annum; and 
(iii.) 
thereafter until the last day of the term of the Access Fund, the Servicing Fee in respect of 
each DB Introduced Person will be equal to the excess of (x) the amount of any 
management fees collected by the Access Fund or the investment manager (as applicable) 
from such DB Introduced Person over (y) 0.20% of such DB Introduced Person's allocable 
share of invested capital. 
In addition, pursuant to a separate agreement to be entered into between the Solicitation Agent 
and one or more of the Underlying Fund, Glendower GP and Glendower Capital, LLC, the Solicitation 
Agent will also act as placement agent for the Underlying Fund and will refer and/or introduce certain of 
its clients to the Underlying Fund. In consideration for such services, the Glendower GP or an affiliate 
shall pay the Solicitation Agent a placement fec equal to 0.75% of the portion of the Access Fund's 
aggregate capital commitment to the Underlying Fund attributable to the subscriptions of each DB 
Introduced Person. 
Other than the foregoing fees, no additional fees or other amounts will be charged to investors by 
the Solicitation Agent or the Access Funds as a result of the Solicitation Agent's involvement. Investors 
in an Access Fund that arc referred by the Solicitation Agent will not pay increased management fees or 
other similar compensation to the Solicitation Agent, iCapital or the Access Funds as a result of the 
referral. 
Given the existence of the compensation arrangements described above, the Solicitation Agent 
may benefit financially from referring clients to an Access Fund rather than to other competitive funds or 
other products that may also be appropriate for particular clients. As a result, the Solicitation Agent's 
receipt of such payments from the iCapital creates a potential conflict of interest in the form of an 
additional financial incentive to the Solicitation Agent, its equity owners and investment representatives 
to refer clients to an Access Fund. In addition, the Solicitation Agent or its affiliates may earn 
compensation from an Access Fund, iCapital or their affiliates through arrangements that may or may not 
directly involve the Solicitation Agent, such as the provision of brokerage or prime brokerage services or 
research. Employees of the Solicitation Agent or its affiliates, including their investment representatives 
who may offer Interests to clients, may now or in the future own Interests.
