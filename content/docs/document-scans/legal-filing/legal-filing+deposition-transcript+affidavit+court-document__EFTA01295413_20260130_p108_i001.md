2 According to Jeepers, Hanlin-Rainaldi did riot remove its ken until after Hanlin-Rainaldi filed suit in North Carolina and another 
settlement agreement in August 2001 was executed_ (Jeepers Reply Memorandurn in Support of Its Motion for Summary 
Judgment, at 4 In. 3.) 
r P8] Jeepers failed to pay the $ 440,000 that it promised to pay upon execution of the 
May 2000 settlement agreement. Thereafter, Hanlin-Rainaldi sued Jeepers, Concord Mills, 
and Win & Associates in a North Carolina court. 
rP9] Additionally, although Jeepers made payments towards satisfying its obligation 
under Note 1, which continued until 2002, r Jeepers ultimately failed to totally satisfy its 
obligation under Note 1. Jeepers did, however, satisfy the cognovit note. 
3 According to Hanlin-Rainaldi. Jeepers failed to make a monthly payment on April 15, 2002, and then failed to make any 
subsequent payments. (Affidavit of Kristy Krull, Comptroller of Hanlin-Rainaldi, dated October 30, 2002, at P7.) Jeepers admits 
it made payments in January and February 2002. (Reply Memorandum of Defendant Jeeperst, Inc. in Support of its Motion For 
Summary Judgment, at 7. fn. 8.) 
r5] r P10] In August 2001, Hanlin-Rainaldi, Jeepers, and Concord Mills entered into a 
settlement agreement to resolve disputed claims. Concurrent with the execution of this 
settlement agreement, Jeepers executed two promissory notes to Hanlin-Rainaldi in the 
amount of $ 165,000 ("Note 2") and $ 75,000 ("Note 3"), respectively. Additionally, 
concurrent with the execution of the second agreement, Concord Mills agreed to put $ 
75,000 in escrow for the benefit of Jeepers to be disbursed to Hanlin-Rainaldi after it 
released its lien and dismissed its lawsuit. Hanlin-Rainaldi acknowledges that it received 
the $ 75,000 that was held in escrow; however, according to Hanlin-Rainaldi, Jeepers 
defaulted on Notes 2 and 3. 
r P11] On May 20, 2002, Hanlin-Rainaldi sued Jeepers in the Franklin County Court of 
Common Pleas, asserting five causes of action, that Jeepers: (1) wrongfully withheld 
payment under Note 1 and was liable for all amounts due under this note; (2) wrongfully 
withheld payment under Note 2 and was liable for all amounts due under this note; (3) 
wrongfully withheld payment under Note 3 and was liable for all amounts due under this 
note; (4) materially breached the agreement r.6] of August 2001 and was liable for the 
balances due under Notes 2 and 3; and (5) had been unjustly enriched and was liable in 
an amount equal to the outstanding balances that were due under Notes 1, 2, and 3. 
Jeepers answered the complaint, wherein it admitted to executing the notes but generally 
denied other allegations in the complaint. 
r P12] Hanlin-Rainaldi later moved for summary judgment as to all claims. Jeepers 
opposed this motion. 
r P13] Later, Jeepers moved for summary judgment concerning Hanlin-Rainaldi's claims 
that arose under the August 2001 agreement and Notes 2 and 3, claiming that the 
agreement and Notes 2 and 3 were executed under economic duress. In the alternative,
