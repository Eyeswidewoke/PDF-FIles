Real Assets: Commodities 
— As China represents the bulk of global demand 
for industrial metals, the recent sell-off in metal 
prices, from copper to steel, was not unexpected. 
— Previously, the fall in commodity prices was seen 
as driven mainly by global oversupply but here 
the problem is on the demand side. 
— Figure 3 compares China's industrial production 
growth and the industrial metal price index. 
— In late 2010 China's manufacturing production 
growth was around 15%-20% as a consequence 
of China's huge fiscal stimulus being channelled 
into investments and infrastructure, worth about 
4% of GDP. 
— This led to a substantial increase in building and 
production, contributing to a real estate 
overheating. When the correction started in 2012, 
economic growth in China fell and led to a 
downtrend in industrial metal prices. 
— To end the decline in industrial metals prices, we 
therefore might need both a reduction of supply 
and an increase in demand (from China in 
particular).

Data as of September 30. 2015 
When a good is seen as increasing in supply, 
normally its price goes down as its scarcity 
reduces. The same is true for the EUR. 
When the ECB signalled (about a year ago) its 
readiness to increase the supply of EUR via the 
driving its balance sheet size yet higher, markets 
logically started to anticipate a lower EUR. 
The increase in the ECB balance sheet has 
stalled in the last two months due to a slowdown 
in the buying of bonds by the ECB. This was 
mainly a function of less liquid bond markets in 
the summer lull, which has now ended. 
The latest comments of the ECB's president in 
the press conference after its meeting point to a 
clear ECB bias to be ready to expand or prolong 
its QE if needed. The only question is when and 
here markets are getting more impatient. 
If the ECB does indeed push QE into a higher 
gear, this could weaken the EUR, as Figure 4 
suggests.

Focus of the week 
Commodities: Industrial metals prices are likely 
to remain closely tied to the state of China's 
economy. 
Global FX: We expect EUR strength to continue 
to be affected by the level of ECB bond 
purchase activity.
