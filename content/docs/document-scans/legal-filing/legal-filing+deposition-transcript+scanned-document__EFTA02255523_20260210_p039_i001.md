Liability Statement. American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. and its parent, 
subsidiaries, affiliates and representatives (collectively, "Amex") act as an agent for travel suppliers 
and you understand and agree that Amex shall not be liable for any loss, injury, expense or damage 
to persons or property resulting, directly or indirectly, from (1) the acts of omissions of travel

Intermediary Disclosure. Amex assists you in finding travel suppliers and making arrangements that 
meet your individual needs. We consider various factors in identifying travel suppliers to you and 
recommending specific itineraries. In this role, we are acting as an independent third party and not 
as a fiduciary. We want you to be aware that certain suppliers pay us commissions as well as 
incentives for reaching sales targets or other goals, and from time to time may also provide 
incentives to our travel counselors. Certain suppliers may also provide compensation to us for 
various marketing and administrative services that we perform for them, such as granting them 
access to our marketing channels, participating in marketing programs and supporting technology 
initiatives. In addition, we receive compensation from suppliers when customers use the American 
Express Card or other American Express products to pay for supplier products and services. From 
time to time we may enter into other business relationships with suppliers and these arrangements, 
including levels and types of compensation and incentives we receive, are subject to change. In 
identifying suppliers and recommending itineraries, we may consider a number of factors, including 
supplier availability and your preferences. The relationships we have with suppliers may also 
influence the suppliers we identify and the itineraries we recommend.
