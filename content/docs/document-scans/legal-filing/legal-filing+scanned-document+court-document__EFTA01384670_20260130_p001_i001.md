HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Valuation of Assets and Liabilities 
The value of the Partnership's assets and liabilities will be primarily based on the value of 
the Underlying Funds' assets and liabilities. The valuation of any asset or liability involves 
inherent uncertainty. The value of a security utilized by the Administrator (as defined below) in 
determining the net asset value of the Partnership and the Underlying Funds may differ materially 
from the value that could have been realized in an actual sale or transfer for a variety of reasons, 
including the timing of the transaction and liquidity in the market. 
GAAP Net Asset Value Divergence 
Due to GAAP requirements, the net asset value of the Partnership for purposes of 
GAAP-compliant financial reporting may diverge from the net asset value of the Partnership for 
all other purposes, including, without limitation, for purposes of allocating gains and losses among 
the Limited Partners, which, as described in this Memorandum, is relevant to, among other things, 
determining the balance of each Capital Account, calculating the Management Fee and the 
Incentive Allocation, and calculating the amounts payable by the Partnership in respect of a 
withdrawal by or distribution to a Limited Partner. Net asset value divergence may occur, for 
example, in connection with the amortization of the organizational and initial offering expenses of 
the Partnership, the measuring of fair value (as a result of Financial Accounting Standards Board 
("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820), or the recognition or unrecognition 
of uncertain tax positions (as a result of FASB ASC 740). 
Certain Trading and Investing Techniques 
Model Risk 
Certain strategies may require the use of quantitative valuation models that the 
Management Company has developed over time, as well as valuation models developed by third 
parties and made available to the Management Company or the Valuation Agents. As market 
dynamics (for example, due to changed market conditions and participants) shift over time, a 
previously highly successful model often becomes outdated or inaccurate, perhaps without the 
Management Company recognizing that fact before substantial losses are incurred. There can be 
no assurance that the Management Company will be successful in continuing to develop and 
maintain effective quantitative models, and the necessity of continuously updating these models 
demonstrates that the Management Company's past successful results may not be representative 
of the Partnership's future performance. Models are subject to limitations, including, but not 
limited to, those caused by incorrect or unrealistic assumptions, computer herding, inapplicability 
of historical data, omission of key data, erroneous code, oversimplification and underpricing risk. 
Model risk extends to the valuation of less liquid investments to the extent they are made 
on the basis of models, taking into account market inputs, where available, and the results of any 
valuation analyses of independent valuation consultants (including a Valuation Agent), in the 
absence of any readily-determinable market values. The valuations so determined may differ 
materially from the value ultimately realized upon the liquidation of such investment.
