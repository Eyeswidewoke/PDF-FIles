circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and 
determine whether further action is needed. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is 
not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step 
impairment test is unnecessary. For the periods presented the Company had recorded no impairment charges.

Table of Contently 
Acquired intangibles consist of acquired technology and customer relationships associated with various acquisitions. Acquired 
technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income-producing capabilities of 
software products acquired on acquisitions. The Company amortizes the acquired technology over its estimated useful life on a 
straight-line basis within cost of revenue. Customer relationships represent relationships that the Company has with customers of 
the acquired companies and are either based upon contractual or legal rights or are considered separable; that is. capable of being 
separated from the acquired entity and being sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged. These customer relationships are 
initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The Company amortizes customer 
relationships on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives within the Company's operating expenses. The Company 
evaluates the remaining estimated useful life of its intangible assets being amortized on an ongoing basis to determine whether 
events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. 
Customers Payable 
Customers payable represents the transaction amounts, less revenue earned by the Company, owed to sellers. The payable 
amount comprises amounts owed to customers due to timing differences, amounts held by the Company in accordance with its risk 
management policies and amounts held for customers who have not yet linked a bank account. 
Accrued Transaction Losses 
The Company is exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks which represent a potential loss due to a dispute 
between a seller and their customer or due to a fraudulent transaction. The Company establishes reserves for estimated losses 
arising from processing payment transactions. These reserves represent the estimated amounts necessary to provide for 
transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date, including those for which the Company has not yet been notified. 
The reserves are based on known facts and circumstances as of the reporting date, including subsequent events, and 
historical trends related to loss rates. Additions to the reserve are reflected in current operating results, while charges to the 
reserve are made when losses are recognized. These amounts are classified within transaction and advance losses on the 
consolidated statements of operations. 
The establishment of appropriate reserves for transaction losses is an estimate based on the available data and is inherently 
an uncertain process. Ultimately, losses may vary from the current estimates. The Company regularly updates its reserve estimates 
as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
a new accounting standard update on revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The new guidance will replace all current 
U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. According to the new guidance, revenue is 
recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which 
the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods

beginning after December 15, 2018. In August 2015. the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which amended the standard to provide 
a one-year deferral of the effective date, as well as providing the option to early adopt the standard on the original effective date.
