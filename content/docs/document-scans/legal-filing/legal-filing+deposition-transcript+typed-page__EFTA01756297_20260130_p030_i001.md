<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">.loshua Pearce, asso=iate professor at Michigan Technological 
University, says: '3D printing =s ready for showtime.' He has carried out an economic analysis of 3D pri=ting in an 
average American household, 
published recently in the journal Mechatronics.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">His team selected 2= relatively inexpensive items for their study: 
mobile phone accessories, a=garlic press, a showerhead, a spoon holder, and the like, and then calcula=ed the cost of 
making them with 3D 
printers. The conclusion: it would cost the typical consumer from $312 to =1,944 — depending on brand and quality — to 
buy those 20 things, compa=ed to $18 to make them in a weekend. If the family made only 20 items a ye=r, Pearce's 
group calculated that the 
printers would pay for themselves within a few months to a few years.</spa=></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">When these printers=become as common as the microwave, 
they will have a profound effect on eve=yday life. DIY will take on a new meaning. Why order parts from a warehous= or 
visit a shop when entire designs 
can be stored in virtual computer warehouses, waiting to be printed locall=, and on demand?</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">You will be able to=make everything from door handles to 
mobile phones in your garage, or at a=neighbourhood 3D print shop. And if you have an actual kitchen garden as w=ll, 
you can grow the plastic — polylactic 
acid is made from fermented plant starch, usually corn. You will have a se=f-replicating 3D printing machine making 
useful goods from a self-replicat=ng material supply.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">'3D printing enab=es engineers and designers to manufacture 
things they couldn't make with=traditional methods,' says Suzy Antoniw, exhibition leader at the Scienc= 
Museum.8.inbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">No country will wan= to be left behind as 3D printing evolves, 
least of all China, once the gl=bal source of low-cost manufacturing and now rapidly moving up the technol=gical 
ladder.&nbsp;</span></P> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">To make sure that B=itain stays at the forefront of this rapidly 
evolving technology, the Engi=eering and Physical Sciences Research Council has set up the Centre for In=ovative 
Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing 
at the University of Nottingham. The aerospace company EADS can print comp=ex geometries rapidly from computer-
aided design information, without the =eed for dies, form tools or moulds.80thsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">The company 3T RPD,=of Greenham Common, Berkshire, 
working in partnership with the University =f Southampton, created the world's first 3D-printed aircraft, a small dr=ne. It 
has also printed the titanium 
lattice of the Queen's Baton for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The baton =ill tour all the competing nations and 
territories before the games.&nbsp;=/span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Bespoke items such =s the baton will not just be small scale. At 
Loughborough University, Rich=rd Buswell is developing a vast, three-storey rig to create buildings by =9lconcrete 
printing' elaborate components 
with far greater complexity than currently possible, opening up almost lim=tless possibilities for 
architects.8mbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">As a result there h=s been an explosion of creativity. The Urbee is 
a hybrid car with a 3D-pri=ted body. Its successor will use additive manufacturing to make both exter=or and 
interior.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Enrico Dini, the lt=lian inventor, has created a device that uses a 
magnesium-based material t= bind sand particles together; creating sedimentary stone, a process that =ormally takes 
hundreds of years, in 
a matter of minutes. Dini's machine, known as the D-Shape, can print any=feature that will fit into a cube that is 6x6 
metres, from artistic stairc=se to kiosks, benches and statues.8inbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">ln space, other opp=rtunities beckon. Imagine landing on the 
Moon or Mars, putting lunar rock =ust through a 3D printer and making something useful — like a wrench or = 
replacement part.&nbsp;</span></p>
