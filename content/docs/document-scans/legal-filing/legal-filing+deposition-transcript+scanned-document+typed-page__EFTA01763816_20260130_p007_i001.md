The biggest part of the good news in=Egypt is that no group is under the illusion that it can govern alone. 
Wha=ever its electoral strength—some of which is comparative rather than absolute—the Brotherhood understands it 
needs=a coalition to rule the country. Further, it appears to have concluded tha= liberal and independent voices make 
more durable political partners than =he other religious parties, which by their nature challenge the Brotherhood's 
religious legitimacy. This d=namic began to play itself out in parliament before it was dissolved, and =t continues to play 
itself out in the constitution-writing process. There =s no Islamist supermajority. 
The Brotherhood has also proven caut=ous in its dealings with the military. The headlines in August were over 
t=e dismissal of Field Marshall Hussein Tantawi, Chief of Staff Sami Anan, and Director of General Intelligence Murad 
Muwaf=, but closer observation suggests that the military has returned to its tr=ditional role more than it has suffered a 
defeat. Egyptian policy toward t=e United States and Israel, which was the foundation of the U.S. relationship with the 
Egyptian military, ha= changed only modestly. The elected government seems to have little appeti=e for taking on the 
United States, Israel, or the military itself.<=span> 
Economically, the government needs a=I the help it can get, and it has sought allies rather than enemies 
overse=s. Closer to home, there have been no massive expropriations or nationalizations. Anticorruption prosecutions 
have been =imited to the highest echelons of the former regime. Tellingly, there is n= massive exodus, among 
businessmen or anyone else. Panic seems absent in E=ypt, and virtually all Egyptians seem to feel there is a possibility 
that they will be able to protect thei= interests in the new order. 
Even the dysfunction in the constitu=ional drafting process has its silver lining. A swift and bold constitutio= 
process that deeply engaged the public would almost certainly polarize the population and set off pitched politic=l 
battles. The more drawn out and uncertain process Egypt is undergoing no= holds out the prospect of grudging 
acceptance with less risk of violence.=/font> 
Almost all of Egypt's problems sti=I lay in front of it, and some seem insurmountable. Yet, among the most 
da=gerous outcomes of the last 20 months would be a process in which a large swath of Egyptians had concluded there 
was n= way politics could meet their needs and their only options would be to ta=e up arms or leave the country. That 
has happened in neighboring countries= but it has not happened in Egypt. Instead, expectations have been lowered and 
timelines expanded. 
Political tensions in Egypt are not = sign of failure, but rather a sign that politics are working. Politics, a=ter all, 
are about juxtaposing contrasting views as much as about unifying a constituency. Even more important, the d=fining 
characteristic of a democratic system is not people's willingness=to win. Instead, it is their willingness to lose, because 
they have faith =hat they just might win the next time. 
Many have lost in Egypt. So far, the= are behaving like democrats. Their legitimate concern is that the 
winners=behave like democrats, too.
