information appears in distant lattice positions), and if we remo=e links, we get spatial superposition (some locations are 
not dangling, so=we cannot project them to a single coordinate any more, but must project t=em into a region). 
On the elementary level, we can define a space by using a set of objects, a=d a bijective function that maps a 
scalar value to a subset of these objec=s. The easiest way of doing might be to define a typed relationship that o=ders 
each pair of objects, and differences in the scalar are mapped to the=number of successive links of that relationship 
type. We can use multiple =elationship types to obtain multiple dimensions, and if we choose the rela=ionships suitably 
we may also construct operators that relate the dimensio=s to each other via translation, rotation and nesting, so we 
derive the pr=perties of Euclidean spaces. 
To get to relativistic space, we need to first think about how information =ight travel through a lattice. If we just 
equalize value differentials at =eighboring locations, we will see that the information dissipates quickly =nd won't travel 
very far. To transmit information over large distances=in a lattice, it must be packaged in a way that preserves the value 
and a =omentum (in the sense of direction), so we can discern its origin. A good =oy model might be the Game of Life 
automaton, which operates on a regular =wo dimensional lattice and allows the construction of stable, traveling 
os=illators (gliders). In Game of life, only the immediate neighbor locations=are involved, so gliders can only travel in 
very few directions. A more fi=e grained momentum requires that the oscillator occupies a large set of ad=acent lattice 
locations. SmoothLife is a variant of Game of Life that uses=very large neighborhoods and indeed delivers stable 
oscillators that can t=avel in arbitrary directions. 
I think I have some idea how to extend this toy model towards oscillators w=th variable speed and more than 
two dimensions. It may also possible to sh=w that there are reasons why stable traveling oscillators can exist in ld,=2d 
and 3d but not in 4d, for similar reasons why stable planetary orbits o=ly work in 3d. 
To give a brief intution about a traveling oscillator as a wavelet: Think o= a wavelet as two concentric circles, one 
representing the deviation above=zero, the other one the deviation below zero. They try to equalize, but be=ause the 
catch up is not immediately, they just switch their value instead= (This is the discretized simplification.) Now displace the 
inner circle w=th respect to the outer one: the arrangement starts to travel. Making the =attern stable requires 
distorting the circles, and probably relaxing the d=scretization by increasing the resolution. The frequency of the wavelet 
os=illation is inversely related to how fast it can travel. 
You can also think of a wavelet as a vortex in a traveling liquid. The vort=x is entirely generated by the molecular 
dynamics within the liquid (which=are our discrete lattice computations), and it does not dissolve because i= is a stable 
oscillator. The vortex can travel perpendicular to the direct=on of the fluid, which is equivalent to traveling in space. It 
cannot go a=bitrarily fast: the progression of the liquid defines a lightcone in which=each molecule can influence other 
molecules, and which limits the travel o= every possible vortex. Also, the faster the vortex moves sideways, the sl=wer it 
must oscillate, because the both translation and state change depen= on sharing the same underlying computation. It 
will also have to contract=in the direction of movement to remain stable, and it will be maximally co=tracted at the 
border of the light cone. (The contraction of a vortex is e=uivalent to giving it a momentum.) 
An observer will always have to be implemented as a stable system capable o= state change, i.e. as a system of 
vortices that interact in such a way th=t they form a multistable oscillator that can travel in unison. From the p=rspective 
of the observer, time is observed rate of state change in its en=ironment, and it depends on its own rate of change, 
which in turn depends =n the speed of the observer. This gives rise to relativistic time. Also, t=e observer does not 
perceive itself as being distorted, but it will normal=ze itself, and instead perceive its environment around itself as being 
dis=orted. As a result, the observer will always have the impression to travel=exactly in the middle of its light cone. This 
model seems to recover Loren=z invariance, but with a slight catch: it seems to me that while speed of =ight is constant 
and there is no preferred frame of reference wrt accelera=ion, the resolution of the universe changes with the speed of 
the observer= No idea if this is a bug or a feature, or if it will be neutralized by so=ething I cannot see yet before I have a 
proper simulation.
