2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87203, * 
inadequacies may be present, the Court finds that judicial resources would not be best 
spent by requiring the Government to submit a revised, more detailed log. See N.L.R.B. v. 
Jackson Hosp. Corp., 257 F.R.D. 302, 307 (D.D.C. 2009) (court may remedy inadequate 
privilege log by in camera inspection of described documents or permitting party another 
chance to submit a more detailed log). 
Petitioners also argue that the Government has failed to provide the factual underpinnings 
necessary to hold that certain privileges apply, specifically the deliberative process 
privilege, investigative privilege, work product privilege, and attorney--client privilege. 
Discussed in more detail below, the Court finds it unnecessary to consider whether the 
deliberative process and investigative privilege apply in rn this case as other, stronger, 
privileges are at play, or, as discussed further below, many of the documents over which 
the deliberative process and investigative privileges are asserted are irrelevant to this 
proceeding. Regarding the work product and attorney--client privileges, and the Court has 
considered the materials submitted and the Government's arguments, and finds that the 
Government has submitted sufficient evidence to evaluate its claims of privilege. (See DE 
238-1) (discussing documents prepared by the United States Attorney's Office in 
anticipation of possible Epstein prosecution); see Stern v. O'Quinn, 253 F.R.D. 663, 675 
(S.D. Fla. 2008) (Rosenbaum, Mag. J.) (relying on allegations within pleading to decide 
application of work product privilege). The Court will therefore evaluate each claim of 
privilege as it relates to the documents submitted. 
2. Grand Jury Secrecy 
The Government asserts that many of the documents identified in its logs are protected by 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), which governs the secrecy of grand jury 
proceedings. (See DE 212-1; DE 216-1 at 4, 6). These documents include subpoenas 
issued and documents received and prepared during the course of grand jury 
investigations into whether Epstein committed indictable federal offenses. rig (DE 212-1 
at 1). Petitioners argue that the Court can (and should) authorize disclosure in this case. 
(DE 265 at 17). 
"It has long been a policy of the law that grand jury proceedings be kept secret . . . . The 
English rule of grand jury secrecy has been incorporated into our federal common law and 
remains an integral part of our criminal justice system." United States v. Aisenberg, 358 
F.3d 1327, 1346 (11th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Rule 6(e) of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure codifies this secrecy principle and prohibits the 
disclosure of grand jury material except in the limited circumstances provided for in Rule 
6(e)(3)." Id. One such exception is Rule (6)(e)(3)(E)(i), which permits a court to authorize 
disclosure "preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding." Fed. R. Crim. P. 
6(e)(3)(E)(i). Additionally, a court has inherent authority to disclose grand jury materials 
beyond the literal wording of Rule 6(e)(3) in "exceptional circumstances." Aisenberg, 358 
F.3d at 1347. "The district court has 'substantial discretion' in determining whether grand 
jury materials should be released." Id. at 1349 (quoting Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops 
N.W., 441 U.S. 211, 223, 99 S. Ct. 1667, 60 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1979)).
