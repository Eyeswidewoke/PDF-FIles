SPOTLIGHT ON 
percentage is itself arbitrary and certain agreements provide 
for other percentages (for example, the Sprint Airlines TRA 
provided for 90%). 
Paying less than 100% of the tax benefit aligns the interests of 
the payor-corporation and the payee-historic equity owners. 
Both the payer and the payees have an economic incentive to 
maximize the value of the relevant tax attributes. For example, 
a corporation that is entitled to a portion of the economic 
benefit of its NOLs is more likely to protect the availability 
of that NOL by monitoring any activity that could result in a 
limitation on its use. 
TERMINATION AND CHANGE OF CONTROL 
TRAs frequently accelerate payments in certain circumstances, 
including a mutual early termination of the agreement by the 
parties and certain material breaches of the agreement by the 
pavor-corporation. Some TRAs also accelerate payments upon 
a change of control of the payor-corporation. 
Alternatively, other TRAs provide that following a change of 
control of the payor-corporation, payments, while not ac-
celerated, are calculated by making certain assumptions (for 
example, that the corporation will have sufficient income in 
each subsequent year to fully utilize the relevant tax attribute 
in that year). 
If the payments under aTRA are accelerated, the termination 
payment generally equals the present value (based on an agreed 
discount rate) of the tax benefit payments that would otherwise 
be paid after the termination.The calculation of the tax benefit 
payments is based on certain assumptions (for example, that 
the corporation will have sufficient income in each year to 
fully utilize the relevant tax attribute and that the applicable 
tax rates will not change). 
IMPUTED INTEREST 
Payments under a TRA that are treated for US federal income 
tax purposes as additional consideration for partnership interests 
or assets may be subject to rules applicable to deferred 
payments (for example, IRC Sections 453 and 483). Whether 
any resulting gain is recognized by the recipient upfront or over 
time as payments arc received depends on whether the install-
ment method of reporting under IRC Section 453 applies (see 
below Tax Treatment). 
In addition, a portion of each deferred payment generally is 
recharacterized as interest to account for the time value of 
money. Any imputed interest payments would generally he 
deductible to the payor-corporation and includible In income 
to the payee-historic equity owners. 
Basis TRAs generally provide that the deduction arising 
from any imputed interest is taken into account in the 
calculation of the tax benefit and therefore gives rise to ad-
ditional payments under the agreement. In the current low 
interest rate environment, any imputed interest payments 
would generally be small. 
TAX TREATMENT 
The US federal income tax consequences of aTRA depend on 
the type of TRA and the form of the transaction. 
TAX TREATMENT OF BASIS TRAs 
Payments under a RasisTRA arc generally treated as additional 
consideration for: 
■ The sale or exchange of operating partnership interests 
(either at the time of the IPO or upon an exchange of 
operating partnership interests for public company stock) 
in the case of an Up-C structure. 
■ The deemed sale of assets in a Section 338(h)(I 0) 
transaction. 
The recipient should he able to report the payments using 
the installment method of reporting (MC § 453). Because 
the amount of the payments is not determinable at the time 
of the transaction, the contingent payment installment sale 
rules apply to determine hmv much basis is allocated to each 
payment. As discussed above, a portion of each payment would 
generally be recharacterized as interest to account for the time 
value of money. 
If the installment method is inapplicable and the "closed" 
transaction method applies, the fair market value of the right 
to receive payments under the Basis TRA is generally treated 
as consideration realized upfront (as of the date of the sale or 
exchange) and the sellers should recognize any resulting gain 
at that time. Going forward, payments made under the TRA 
(other than any portion recharacterized as interest) give rise to 
additional income or gain at the time of receipt. to the extent 
those payments exceed the amount taken into income upfront. 
Potentially, such excess payments would he characterized as 
ordinary income or capital gain by reference to the sale or 
exchange. I lowever, this tax treatment is uncertain because 
sale or exchange treatment may be at odds with the closed 
transaction method. 
The "open* transaction method may serve as an alternative 
way for a seller to report gain. The open transaction method 
permits gain recognition only when payments are received 
or fixed (depending on the applicable method of accounting 
and with basis being recovered first). I lowever, the open 
transaction method can generally only be used in those rare and 
extraordinary cases where the lair market value of the payment 
obligation cannot berea.sonabIs ascertained." 
Regardless of whether the installment method applies, the 
gain resulting from a Basis TRA (other than any imputed 
interest) should generally be characterized as capital gain rather 
than ordinary income (with certain exceptions, such as asset
