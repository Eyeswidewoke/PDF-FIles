operations of the Company. That control will include whether the Company (including shares of 
capital stock in the Company) is to be sold or merged. 
The Company will have discretion over the use of proceeds from the Offering. 
Subject to the Company's commitment to use the first $1 million of offering proceeding to 
purchase certain business and assets from VPI (as described above), the Company intends to use 
any balance of proceeds from the Offering for working capital and general business purposes. 
The use of such proceeds will be subject to the discretion of the Company, and neither the 
Subscriber nor any other investor will be able to direct or control the use of any of such proceeds. 
The Company will be heavily dependent upon management, particularly in its early stages 
of development. 
The Company will be dependent on the services of it founder, Steven A. Victor, M.D., as 
well as on other members of any management team employed by the Company. If the services of 
Dr. Victor or other key management personnel are not available, the Company would be severely 
and adversely affected. 
The Company nut) not be able to employ or retain qualified personnel. 
There is no assurance that the Company will be able to hire or retain qualified personnel to 
implement its business plans or to operate and develop the Company's business. Because of its 
early stage of development and uncertain future, the Company may have more difficulty in 
attracting and keeping qualified personnel. 
If the Company is successful, it may face stiff competition. 
If the Company succeeds with the development of its business plans, others would likely 
be encouraged to try to establish competing businesses. It is uncertain as to whether there will be 
any meaningful bathers to establishing competing business, and the establishment of competing 
businesses could adversely affect the financial results and prospects of the Company. Further, to 
the extent a competing business is established by a competitor with greater financial and other 
resources, the adverse affect could be substantial. 
The Company may not be able to protect any technology, concepts or other intellectual 
property needed for the development of its business. 
Although the Company anticipates that it will develop or otherwise acquire or own certain 
proprietary information and other intellectual property (including that anticipated to be acquired 
from VPI pursuant to the transaction with VPI referred to above) in connection with the 
development of its business, there can be no assurance that any of such intellectual property will 
be subject to patent, copyright, trademark or similar protections or that the Company will 
otherwise be able to protect or preserve such intellectual property. If the Company is not able to 
protect any technology, concepts or other intellectual property that is essential to its operations or 
development, the loss of such technology, concepts or other intellectual property (or loss of the 
exclusive right to such technology, concepts or other intellectual property) could have a material 
and adverse affect on the Company and its business, financial condition and prospects.
