Recently Adopted Accounting Standards: In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting 
Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03, interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance 
Costs." The objective of this ASU is to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a 
recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent 
with debt discounts. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 for publicly 
traded companies and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been 
previously issued. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on March 1, 2015. Asa result of the adoption, the Company reclassified 
unamortized deferred financing costs from Other assets to a reduction in Long-term debt. The adoption did not have an impact on the 
Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations or the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards: In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance through ASU 2014-09, "Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606) The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the 
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled 
in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: 1) Identify the 
contract(s) with a customer. 2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) Determine the transaction price, 4) Allocate the 
transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and 5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a 
performance obligation. For public entities, this pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 
2017. Early application is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement.
