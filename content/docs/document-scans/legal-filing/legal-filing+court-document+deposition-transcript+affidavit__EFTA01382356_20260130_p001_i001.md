Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Robert L. Edwards 
Mr. Edwards was party to an employment agreement with AB Management Services Corp., a subsidiary of the company, dated 
December 15, 2014 (the "Edwards Employment Agreement"). The Edwards Employment Agreement became effective as of the closing 
date of the Safeway acquisition. Pursuant to the Edwards Employment Agreement, Mr. Edwards served as President and Chief 
Executive Officer of the company, and certain of its subsidiaries. Mr. Edwards' annual base salary was $1,500,000 and he was eligible to 
receive a bonus under a plan established by the company with a target bonus of 100% of his base salary and a maximum bonus of 
200% of base salary. The Edwards Employment Agreement also provided for the grant of Series 1 Incentive Units described above 
under "—Incentive Plans—Incentive Unit Plan." If Mr. Edwards' employment would have been terminated by us without Cause or by him 
for Good Reason, subject to his execution of a release, Mr. Edwards would have been entitled to a lump sum severance payment equal 
to two times the sum of his base salary and the target bonus, and reimbursement of the cost of continuation coverage of group health 
coverage for 18 months; but if the termination was within 24 months of the closing of the Safeway acquisition, the severance amount 
would not be less than he would have received under the Safeway Executive Severance Plan for termination following a "Change in 
Control." 
For the purposes of the Edwards Employment Agreement, "Cause" generally meant: 
• conviction of a felony; 
acts of intentional dishonesty resulting or intending to result in material personal gain or enrichment at the expense of the 
company, its subsidiaries or its affiliates; 
• Mr. Edwards' material breach of his obligations under the Edwards Employment Agreement, including but not limited to breach 
of the restrictive covenants and fraudulent, unlawful or grossly negligent conduct by Mr. Edwards in connection with his duties 
under the Edwards Employment Agreement; 
• personal conduct by Mr. Edwards which materially discredited or materially economically damaged the company, its subsidiaries 
or its affiliates; or 
contravention of specific lawful direction from our board of directors. 
For the purposes of the Edwards Employment Agreement "Good Reason" generally meant: 
a reduction in the base salary or target bonus; 
• a material diminution in Mr. Edwards' title, duties or responsibilities (including reporting requirements); 
• relocation of Mr. Edwards' principal location of work to any location that was in excess of 50 miles from the location thereof on 
January 30, 2015 (other than Boise, Idaho) or, if we required him to move to Boise, Idaho, any subsequent relocation that was 
in excess of 50 miles from the location of the company in Boise, Idaho; or 
• a material breach of the Edwards Employment Agreement or an equity award agreement by the company or any of its 
subsidiaries. 
On April 9, 2015. the company, AB Management Services Corp. and Mr. Edwards entered into the Director and Consultancy 
Agreement which superseded the Edwards Employment Agreement. See "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions."
