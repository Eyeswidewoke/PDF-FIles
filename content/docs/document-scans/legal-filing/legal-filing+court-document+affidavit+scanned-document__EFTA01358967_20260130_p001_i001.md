At these rates, the First-Lien Note holders contend that they would have received around 
r271 $150 million more than the Plan offered, Br. of First-Lien Appellant 25, 33. The 1.5-
Lien Note holders claim that the interest rate chosen by the lower courts led them to 
receive notes "valued by the market at less than 93 cents on the value of the secured 
claims," Br. of 1.5-Lien Appellant 20.,, The Plan was objectionable ["801] to the Senior-
Lien Notes holders because, in essence, it required them to lend Debtors a significant sum 
of money and receive a much lower rate of interest than any other lender would have 
received for offering the same loan to MPM on the open market. 
11 The Senior-Lien Notes holders offered evidence that the market price for their notes dropped, respectively, from 101.375% 
and 104.000% six days prior to the bankruptcy court's oral decision, to 94.375% and 92.563% rine days after that decision. 15-
1682 JA 3991 liii 5-6, 8-9. 
[HN10] When dealing with a sub-prime loan in the Chapter 13 context, "value" can be 
elusive because the market is not necessarily efficient and the borrower is typically 
unsophisticated. However, where, as here, an efficient market may exist that generates an 
interest rate that is apparently acceptable to sophisticated parties dealing at arms-length, 
we conclude, consistent with footnote 14, that such a rate is preferable to a formula 
improvised by a court. See Bank of America, 526 U.S. at 457; see also GMAC v. Valenti 
(In m Valenti), 105 F.3d at 63 (the goal of the cramdown rate "is to put the creditor in the 
same economic position that it would have been in had it received the value of its allowed 
claim ("28] immediately"); see also 15-1682 JA 3428 (First-Lien Notes holders' expert 
testifying that because the First-Lien Notes holders "are pricing it at the market . 
theyre 
being compensated for the underlying risk that they are taking," and not for any "imbedded 
profit"). 
We understand that the complexity of the task of determining an appropriate market rate 
will vary from case to case. In some cases the task will be straightforward, in others it will 
be more complex. But, at the end of the day, we have no reason to believe the task varies 
materially in difficulty from the myriad tasks which we regularly rely on the expertise of our 
bankruptcy courts to resolve. 
We therefore conclude that the lower courts erred in categorically dismissing the probative 
value of market rates of interest. We remand so that the bankruptcy court can ascertain if 
an efficient market rate exists and, if so, apply that rate, instead of the formula rate.,: We 
arrive at no conclusion with regard to the outcome of this inquiry. 
12 We acknowledge that the lower courts grappled with the Senior-Lien Notes holders' evidence regarding MPM's quoted exit 
financing, and made express their view that the rate produced by that process may not in fact have been produced by an 
efficient market. 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 3926, 2014 WI 4436335. at '26. '29: 531 B.R. at 334 n.9. Nevertheless. Judge Drain left 
no ambiguity that he applied the lomyula" approach for Chapter 13 individual bankruptcy cases as dictated by the Till plurality

Briccetti agreed with this approach. 531 B.R. at 334. As discussed. this was in error. The bankruptcy court should have the 
opportunity to engage the American HomePatient analysis in earnest.
