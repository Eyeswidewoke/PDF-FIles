By arranging porphyrin dye molecules on a clay surface using the "Size-Matching Effect," researchers have 
demonstrated an energy transfer efficiency of approximately 100%, which is an important requirement for designing 
efficient artificial light-harvesting systems. Image credit: Ishida, et al. ©2011 American Chemical Society 
(PhysOrg.com) In an attempt to mimic the photosynthetic systems found in plants and some bacteria, scientists have 
taken a step toward developing an artificial light-harvesting system (LHS) that meets one of the crucial requirements for 
such systems: an approximately 100% energy transfer efficiency. Although high energy transfer efficiency is just one 
component of the development of a useful artificial LHS, the achievement could lead to clean solar-fuel technology that 
turns sunlight into chemical fuel. 
The researchers, led by Shinsuke Takagi from the Tokyo Metropolitan University and PRESTO of the Japan Science and 
Technology Agency, have published their study on their work toward an artificial LHS in a recent issue of the Journal of 
the American Chemical Society <http://www.physorg.com/tags/journal+of+the+american+chemical+society/> . 
"In order to realize an artificial light-harvesting system, almost 100% efficiency is necessary," Takagi told PhysOrg.com. 
"Since light-harvesting systems consist of many steps of energy transfer 
<http://www.physorg.com/tags/energy+transfer/> , the total energy transfer efficiency becomes low if the energy 
transfer efficiency of each step is 90%. For example, if there are five energy transfer steps, the total energy transfer is 
0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 = 0.59. In this way, an efficient energy transfer reaction plays an important role in realizing 
efficient sunlight collection for an artificial light-harvesting system." 
As the researchers explain in their study, a natural LHS (like those in purple bacteria 
<http://www.physorg.com/tags/bacteria/> or plant leaves) is composed of regularly arranged molecules that efficiently 
collect sunlight and carry the excitation energy to the system's reaction center. An artificial LHS (or "artificial leaf") 
attempts to do the same thing by using functional dye molecules. 
Building on the results of previous research, the scientists chose to use two types of porphyrin dye molecules for this 
purpose, which they arranged on a clay surface. The molecules' tendency to aggregate or segregate on the clay surface 
made it challenging for the researchers to arrange the molecules in a regular pattern like their natural counterparts. 
"A molecular arrangement with an appropriate intermolecular distance is important to achieve nearly 100% energy 
transfer efficiency," Takagi said. "If the intermolecular distance is too near, other reactions such as electron transfer 
and/or photochemical reactions would occur. If the intermolecular distance is too far, deactivation of excited dye 
surpasses the energy transfer reaction." 
In order to achieve the appropriate intermolecular distance, the scientists developed a novel preparation technique 
based on matching the distances between the charged sites in the porphyrin molecules and the distances between 
negatively charged (anionic) sites on the clay surface. This effect, which the researchers call the "Size-Matching Rule," 
helped to suppress the major factors that contributed to the porphyrin molecules' tendency to aggregate or segregate, 
and fixed the molecules in an appropriate uniform intermolecular distance. As Takagi explained, this strategy is 
significantly different than other attempts at achieving molecular patterns. 
"The methodology is unique," he said. "In the case of usual self-assembly systems, the arrangement is realized by guest-
guest interactions. In our system, host-guest interactions play a crucial role for realizing the special arrangement of dyes. 
Thus, by changing the host material, it is possible to control the molecular arrangement of dyes on the clay surface." 
As the researchers demonstrated, the regular arrangement of the molecules leads to an excited energy transfer 
efficiency <http://www.physorg.com/tags/transfer+efficiency/> of up to 100%. The results indicate that porphyrin dye
