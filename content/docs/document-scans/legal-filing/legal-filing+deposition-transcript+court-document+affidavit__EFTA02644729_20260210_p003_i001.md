l=personally will meet with speak with any one or all of them. s= put your mind at ease. 
they are 
right in certain =egards. however it tells me little re the overall situation. =C2* The interest language is ok. it was 
designed=to merely pass through the same amount that the trust was paying , a= they were borrowing the money 
themselves from pershing. and y=u were only required to pay the same rate that they were paying. .=C240 however I 
have many questions re the overall. 4>=AO . we can rectify this fairly quickly . but I wa=t to make sure we have all the 
documents first. 
1=C24> did the children EARN any of the money under discussion or is =his all noams. 2 did his past 
wife earn this money. 40=A0 ? I suggest you tell them that you wish to collect all docu=ents in one place. and then the 
moment that is complete you will hav= someone sit with them. . dont let on its me...A0 . tell them as soon as you 
have all the docs you will strai=hten this all out. .

Hi, thanks for your reply. 
We are very, very concerned that y=u are not understanding and not getting help in 
understanding what is happeni=g with your finances. Your responses below only increase our concern. The three of us 
are not able to serve as financial advisors. We urge you strongly to speak directly with Max so that he can clarify what 
he says in the Memo and explain what the Promissory Note language means. 
Just to give you one example of ou= concern: You focus on one phrase: that the interest will be 
"=t the highest rate in effect." But you are taking those words out of =ontext. We really don't think we should be trying 
to explain these d=tails to you, but to try to summarize: this phrase applied to the double nature of the loan—the 
Marital Trust had to borrow money from Persh=ng to make the loan to you, until the Lexington house was sold. The 
phrase you quote applies only to that brief period, and has no impact on the interest accruing now or in the future. 
We can see why focusing on those s=x words would make you angry. But the six words mean 
nothing in and of themse=ves (i.e., what rate is "in effect"?). But instead of doi=g the logical thing—getting the full 
information—you are just so angry th=t you refuse to find out the truth.
