conversion, dividend distribution and other rights to be determined by the board at the time of issuance. Our certificate of incorporation gives our board this 
right. 
Multi-class structure 
As discussed above, our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, while our common stock, which is the class of stock we are selling in this offering 
and which will be the only class of stock which is publicly traded, has one vote per share. Our Class C common stock, of which no shares will be outstanding 
immediately following this offering, will not have any voting rights. Because of our multi-class structure, IAC will be able to control all matters submitted to our 
stockholders for approval even if it owns significantly less than 50% of our total outstanding capital stock. This concentrated control could discourage others 
from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. 
In addition. IAC is permitted to transfer its capital stock to third parties. including through a sale or a distribution of IAC's capital stock to IAC's stockholders. In 
a distribution. IAC may choose to distribute our Class B common stock only to holders of IAC's high-vote Class B common stock, and to distribute our common 
stock to holders of IAC's low-vote common stock. Any such transfer or distribution could result in persons other than IAC having a significant portion of the 
combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock relative to their equity interest.
