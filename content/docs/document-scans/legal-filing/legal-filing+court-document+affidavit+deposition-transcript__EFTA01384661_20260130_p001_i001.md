economic downturns and changes in interest rates; (ii) sensitivity to adverse economic changes 
and corporate developments; (iii) redemption or call provisions which may be exercised at 
inopportune times; and (iv) being subject to substantial risk of default, bankruptcy, moratorium, 
etc. 
Valuing high-yield and distressed credit instruments is an inherently uncertain process due 
to the lack of available market prices and the uncertain financial condition of the issuers (and the 
lack of reliable information concerning such issuers' financial condition). These valuation 
difficulties can be expected to be materially exacerbated in certain markets. 
Investments in Loans 
Although priority loans in which an Underlying Fund will invest may hold the most senior 
position in the capitalization structure of the borrower, a borrower's inability to meet its payment 
obligations under junior debt may detract from the borrower's perceived creditworthiness, reduce 
the value and liquidity of the loans made to the borrower and impair the borrower's ability to 
obtain financing to cover short-term cash flow needs, which may force the borrower into 
bankruptcy or other forms of credit restructuring. 
Certain of the loans acquired by an Underlying Fund will be issued by entities which face 
ongoing uncertainties and exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions and the 
issuer's failure to make timely interest and principal payments. The market values of certain of 
these debt investments may reflect individual corporate developments, and it is likely that a major 
economic recession would have a materially adverse impact on their value. Adverse publicity and 
investor perceptions surrounding an issuer's "distressed" financial situation may decrease the 
value and liquidity of its debt. 
Bank Loans. An Underlying Fund may acquire interests in bank loans and other debt 
obligations either directly (by way of sale or assignment) or indirectly (by way of participation). 
The purchaser of an assignment typically succeeds to all the rights and obligations of the assigning 
institution and becomes a lender under the credit agreement with respect to the debt obligation; 
however, its rights can be more restricted than those of the assigning institution. A participation 
interest in a portion of a debt obligation typically results in a contractual relationship with only the 
institution acting as a lender under the credit agreement, not with the borrower. As a holder of a 
participation interest, an Underlying Fund generally will have no right to exercise the rights of the 
lender under the credit agreement, including the right to enforce compliance by the borrower with 
the terms of the loan agreement, approve amendments or waivers of terms, nor will an Underlying 
Fund have any rights of set-off against the borrower, and the Underlying Fund may not directly 
benefit from the collateral supporting the debt obligation in which it has purchased the 
participation. As a result, the Underlying Fund will be exposed to the credit risk of both the 
borrower and the institution selling the participation. 
An Underlying Fund may invest directly or through participations in loans with revolving 
credit features or other commitments or guarantees to lend funds in the future. A failure by an 
Underlying Fund to advance requested funds to a borrower could result in claims against the 
Underlying Fund and in possible assertions of offsets against amounts previously lent.
