785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **;

according to their plain meaning). A pattern of discrimination, revealed through statistics 
and anecdotal evidence, can alone support a disparate treatment claim, even where the 
pattern is the result of discretionary decision-making. 
21 Contrary to the dissents assertion, we do not find 'in the first instance' that the worker's allegation is correct. Instead. we 
conclude that the district court dearly erred in finding ("50] that the allegation was not sufficiently supported by the record. 
To hold otherwise would dramatically undermine Title VII's prophylactic powers. As the 
Supreme Court observed in Griggs, a central purpose of Title VII is "to achieve equality of 
employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an 
identifiable group of white employees over other employees." 401 U.S. at 429-30; see also 
Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 417-18, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed. 2d 280 
(1975) (stressing Title VII's prophylactic goals in addition to its purpose "to make persons 
whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination"). Here, 
where substantial evidence suggests a pattern of engrained discriminatory decision-
making that consistently disadvantaged black workers at Nucor, to deny class certification 
would significantly weaken Title VII as a bulwark against discrimination. 
C. 
[HN24] Statistics and anecdotes suggesting a pattern of discrimination, however, are not 
enough alone to sustain a disparate impact claim. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2555; 
Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 994, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827 
(1988). Disparate impact liability requires the identification of a specific employment 
practice that caused racially disparate results. See 42 U.S.C. § 20O0e-2(k); Watson, 487 
U.S. at 986-87; Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431. Unlike disparate treatment, the disparate impact 
theory does not require proof of improper intent [" 51 ] to sustain a Title VII violation. 
Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 349; Griggs, 401 U.S. at 429-31 (finding the use of standardized 
tests resulted in a disparate impact). Instead, liability is premised on facially neutral 
policies. Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431. 
[HN25] Under Wal-Mart, a mere showing that a "policy of discretion has produced an 
overall . . . disparity does not suffice." Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2556. Instead, plaintiffs who 
allege such a policy of discretion must demonstrate that a "common mode of exercising 
discretion" actually existed throughout a company. Id. at 2554; see also Tabor v. Hilti, Inc., 
703 F.3d 1206, 1229 (10th Cir. 2013) (observing that "after Wal-Mart, federal courts . . . 
have generally denied certification when allegedly discriminatory [' 916] policies are 
highly discretionary and the plaintiffs do not point to a common mode of exercising 
discretion that pervades the entire company" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Given 
that standard, the district court here found that the workers "failed to identify any factor that 
unites the manner in which the various decision makers throughout the Berkeley plant 
exercised their discretion." J.A. 10955. 
Wal-Mart recognizes that in certain cases, "giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can 
be the basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact theory," 131 S. Ct. at 2554, 
because "an employer's undisciplined system ("52] of subjective decisionmaking [can 
have] precisely the same effects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional
