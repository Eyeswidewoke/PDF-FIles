affected. 
In addition, our hardware interoperates with mobile devices developed by third parties. For example, the current version of 
Square Reader plugs into the audio jack of most smartphones and tablets. Changes in the design of these mobile devices may 
limit the interoperability of our hardware with such devices and require modifications to our hardware. If we are unable to ensure 
that our hardware continues to interoperate effectively with such devices, or if doing so is costly, our business may be materially 
and adversely affected. 
Many of our key components are procured from a single or limited number of suppliers. Thus, we are at risk of shortage, 
price increases, changes, delay, or discontinuation of key components, which could disrupt and materially and adversely 
affect our business. 
Many of the key components used to manufacture our products, such as the custom parts of Square Reader for magnetic 
stripe cards, including its magnetic stripe-reading element, its plastic cover, and its application-specific integrated circuits, come 
from limited or single sources of supply, as do the plastic cover, connector, and security cage of Square Reader for EMV chip cards 
and NFC. In addition, in some cases, we rely only on one manufacturer to fabricate, test, and assemble our products. For example, 
a single manufacturer assembles Square Reader for magnetic stripe cards and Square Reader for EMV chip cards and NFC, as 
well as manufactures those products' plastic parts with custom tools that we own but that they maintain on their premises. The term 
of the agreement with that manufacturer initially expired on June 26, 2014, but automatically renewed (and will continue to renew) 
for consecutive one-year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal. In general, our contract manufacturers 
fabricate or procure components on our behalf, subject to certain approved procedures or supplier lists, and we do not have firm 
commitments from all of these manufacturers to provide all components, or to provide them in quantities and on timelines that we 
may require. To date, we have not identified alternative manufacturers for the assembly of our products and for most of the single-
sourced components used in our products. For example, pursuant to a development and supply agreement, a component supplier

Table of Conte 
provides design, development, customization, and related services for components of the magnetic stripe-reading element in some 
of our products. The term of the agreement will continue until September 30, 2016. at which point it will automatically renew for 
successive two-year terms unless either party provides notice of non-renewal. Similarly, a component provider develops certain 
application-specific integrated circuits for our products pursuant to our designs and specifications. The term of our agreement with 
this provider will continue until March 24, 2016, and will automatically renew for consecutive one-year periods unless either party 
provides notice of non-renewal. Due to our reliance on the components or products produced by suppliers such as these, we are 
subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of certain components or products. In the case of off-the-shelf 
components, we are subject to the risk that our suppliers may discontinue or modify them or that the components may cease to be 
available on commercially reasonable terms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, component 
shortages or delays or other problems in product assembly, and the availability of these components or products may be difficult to 
predict. Additionally, various sources of supply-chain risk, including strikes or shutdowns at delivery ports or loss of or damage to 
our products while they are in transit or storage, could limit the supply of our products. In the event of a shortage or supply 
interruption from suppliers of these components, we may not be able to develop alternate sources quickly, cost-effectively, or at all. 
Any interruption or delay in component supply, any increases in component costs, or the inability to obtain these parts or 
components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would harm our ability to provide 
our products to sellers on a timely basis. This could harm our relationships with our sellers, prevent us from acquiring new sellers, 
and materially and adversely affect our business. 
Our business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products and to adequately manage 
our product inventory. 
We invest broadly in our business, and such investments are driven by our expectations of the future success of a product. 
Our products, such as Square Reader. often require investments with a long lead times. An inability to correctly forecast the 
success of a particular product could harm our business. We must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders 
sufficiently in advance with our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand for 
particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including an 
increase or decrease in demand for our products or for our competitors' products, unanticipated changes in general market 
conditions, and the change in economic conditions. 
If we underestimate demand for a particular product, our contract manufacturers and suppliers may not be able to deliver
