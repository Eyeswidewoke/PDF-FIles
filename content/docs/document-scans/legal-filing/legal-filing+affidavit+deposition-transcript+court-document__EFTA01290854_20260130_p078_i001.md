Important Information and Disclosures 
Pricing 
This section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including short positions, at the close of the statement period. The market prices, unless otherwise noted, 
have been obtained from independent vendor services, which we believe to be reliable. Market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ from the actual sale price. Securities for which a price is 
not available are marked 'N/A" and are omitted from the Total. 
THE AS OF PRICE DATE ONLY APPEARS WHEN THE PRICE DATE DOES NOT EQUAL THE STATEMENT DATE. 
The pricing of securities on this statement may vary from their actual liquidation value. Prices shown should only be used as a general guide to portfolo value. Cash shown in this statement may not necessarily 
be available for investment due to unsettled transactions against your account(s). Prices for marketable securities are received from various pricing services thought to be reliable; however, pricing services are 
sometimes unable to provide timely information. 1Miere pricing sources are not readily available, estimated prices may be used. Wien the updated price is received from the price provider, the updated price will 
be used in the release of the current month's statement. Prior statements wil not be revised. You should always request a current valuation for your securities prior to making a financial decision or placing an 
order. 
Deutsche Bank proprietary investments and miscellaneous assets held by Discretionary Accounts, Trust Accounts and Custody Accounts include several categories of securities. Miscellaneous foreign assets 
are priced via third party sources believed to be reliable. 
For certain securities. including thinly-traded securities. debt securities in default, securities that do not have a valid pricing source, and certain third-party structured products, the last available pricing will be 
listed. If the last price available for such securities is unchanged for a period of tine deemed appropriate for that asset, the current price will purge and WA will be placed in the price field in the statement. The 
pricing of listed options takes into account the last closing price, as well as the current bid and offer prices.

These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable; however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any tine, 
and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position 
quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant A capital gain or retum of principal may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to 
vnwripershing.cornibusiness_continuity.htni for specific deans as to formulas used to calculate the figures. Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received.
