In the spirit of our ongoing commitment to ensuring your total comfort with every aspect of your travel experience. Uncharted Outposts continues to work 
on your behalf to protect your vacation investment. Cancellation of a booking must be in writing to Uncharted Outposts. Cancellations are only effective 
on receipt of written notification whereupon you will be obliged to pay the sums set out in the following scale of charges:

Please understand that Uncharted Outposts cannot recover expenses if you cancel or leave a trip early. Should you fail to start the trip or join it after 
departure or leave it prior to its completion, no trip refund can be made. If the reason for cancellation falls within the terms of any travel insurance policy 
you are holding, then any such charges will normally be refunded to you by the insurance company, subject to the terms of your insurance. During the 
planning stage of your trip, a significant investment in both time and resources has been make to coordinate all the moving parts of your customized trip 
including: all meet & greet arrangements. ground transportation, accommodation reservations at remote locations, guiding, domestic flights and often 
international flights. Also, most of the properties that we operate in association with are very small and exclusive, accommodating only 6 to 20 guests. 
therefore they are forced to have strict cancellation penalties to protect their limited bednights. 
TRAVEL INSURANCE 
Buying travel insurance used to be like making out a will: You hoped that if you never got around to arranging it. maybe you would never need A Since 
9/11. though, the number of Americans purchasing travel insurance has jumped from around 7 percent to nearly 30 percent. Yet, despite concerns 
about terrorism, war, and SARS, the vast majority of claims are filed for everyday problems that force people to postpone or cancel their tnps. With your 
vacations representing investments of thousands of dollars, it makes sense to spring for policies that cost as little as 4 percent of the total outlay. 
While we hope that there is never a need for these insurance benefits, a trip cancellation policy will help should any unforeseeable emergency arise. 
In the past, we have had clients who have had to cancel just a few days before a trip begins due to a variety of unforeseen reasons (e.g. a broken arm. 
death in the family, severe illness. a school athletic injury. etc). Unfortunately, we are unable to reimburse you for the cost of the tnp. Hence, we highly 
recommend the purchase of Travel Insurance. 
We offer Access America's Classic & Deluxe Policy for those traveling with us. A description of the coverage is included in this packet. If you are 
interested in protecting your trip, please contact Uncharted Outposts as there is additional coverage benefits for signing up within 15 days of initial trip 
deposit or payment. SEE ACCESS AMERICA INFO SHEET FOR FULL DETAILS
