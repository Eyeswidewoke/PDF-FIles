The Administration=92s recent move restricting Egypt's military assistance pipeline—a cor=erstone of the Israel-Egypt 
peace treaty that has kept Israel's southern=flank quiet for 34 years—only adds to the insecurity felt by America's 
longstanding Arab allies as well as Israel. 
President Obama mus= separate these wider complications of US-Iran relations from the nuclear =egotiations, but 
without disregarding them. Although Mr. Obama expressed t=e hope at the UN that a nuclear agreement with Iran can 
"help serve as a foundation for a broader peace," it sho=ld be clear that Tehran's Revolutionary Guards have every 
intention to c=ntinue prosecuting their campaigns, working through extremist non-state ac=ors, to destabilize rival 
societies to the west. 
Until the day comes=when no more Iranian arms, money, explosives and training are flowing to c=ient militias, 
Ambassador Indyk is going to need to point to a regional Am=rican security posture that Israelis and Palestinians can 
believe in should they be otherwise prepared to bring=forth an historic final-status settlement. If at the same time 
Egypt's m=litary is casting about for alternative strategic partnerships, Mr. Indyk=92s task will be that much more 
daunting. 
The US has every ri=ht, and every interest, in pursuing its own interests throughout the Middl= East. If success in 
effecting a transition in Syria to a more acceptable =uccessor government is taken as a setback in Tehran, that should 
not deter Washington. Nor should the US hesitate an= longer to impose a principled, legally correct line with Iraqi Prime 
Mini=ter Maliki in order that US-Iraq military relations will not be further ta=nted by dishonor or moral compromise. 
Should the Obama team see fit to reaffirm its commitment to the security o= Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arab states, and 
to Egypt's military, this re=uilding of confidence with the Sunni Arab world should neither surprise Ir=n nor perturb the 
nuclear negotiations. 'Peace through strength' has always entailed much more than combat pow=r alone. 
Conclusion—Discre=e Deal with Iran, Invest in Syria's Outcome, Restore Regional Confidence= Enable Israeli-Palestinian 
Settlement 
With congressional =upport, the president should seize the initiative and give his negotiators=the requisite leverage to 
secure, as soon as practicable, a comprehensive =ut discrete nuclear-for-sanctions agreement with Iran. Isolating that 
issue will guard against policy paralysis in oth=r areas deemed to be sensitive for Iran, and empower the Administration 
to=go to work repairing its frayed standing in the Arab world. 
The dismantlement o= Syria's chemical arsenal will be of little benefit if, thanks to US ina=tion, Hezbollah emerges 
strengthened and emboldened, Syria's Kurds break=away, and the Sunni majority embraces the only 'help' currently on 
offer—from radical Sunni religious extremis=s drawn to the sectarian fight from all over the region. What began as an 
=dealistic 'Arab spring' moment is deteriorating into another potential=Afghanistan, placing enormous new security and 
economic burdens on Jordan, Lebanon <http://www-

letting 1161 extremists maintain the initiative, the President should challenge his national-security team =o devise a 
whole-of-government strategy worthy of the name for Syria <http://nationali=terest.org/commentary/plan-syria-8924> 
[=7), one that does not place US forces on Syrian territory or pilots in Syr=an airspace. 
These regional circ=mstances will inevitably affect Ambassador Indyk's prospects of success =s well. Israel's leaders will 
be less likely to trust in a settlement wi=h the Palestinians if the surrounding Arab countries are engulfed in crisis. Israeli 
citizens will find it harder to =erceive a peace benefit if they remain in the crosshairs of not only nucle=r threats but also 
ever more deadly mortars, rockets and missiles smuggled=to local extremists by Iran's Revolutionary Guards. 
With so much invest=d and so much at stake in the Middle East, it is never too late to step up=efforts to advance 
American interests. The credibility of presidential red=lines matters, but only by exercising leadership in taming the 
dangers clouding the region's future will the U= preserve its influence and reputation, which are foundations of 
American =ower.
