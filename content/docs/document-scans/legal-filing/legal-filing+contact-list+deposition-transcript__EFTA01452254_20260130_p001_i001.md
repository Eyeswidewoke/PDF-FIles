SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Merits of Secondary Investing 
— The private equity secondaries market provides a way for investors to sell their existing private equity 
investments despite the illiquid nature of the asset class 
— The secondary strategy has the potential for an attractive risk-reward profile: 
— Investments in mature assets that typically yield more predictable and earlier cash flows 
— Investments draw down and return capital more quickly than with primary funds — this mitigates the "J-curve" 
— Provides diversification across vintage years. fund managers, strategies. industries and geographies 
— Investments in re-priced existing assets to reflect current performance and economic environment
