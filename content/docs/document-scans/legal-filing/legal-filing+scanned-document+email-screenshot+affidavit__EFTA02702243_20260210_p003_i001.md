iPayment: Attractive Business with Strong Relative Value; Init=ating with Overweight 
We are initiating coverage of iPayment with an Overweight rating. The c=mpany is a leading merchant acquirer serving 
small businesses and ha= benefitted from increasing electronic payments by consumers. iPayment h=s generated higher 
margins given the challenging nature of the small busin=ss space. While attrition has been a concern, the company 
generally uses=excess cash flow to make acquisitions and maintain its portfolio.a:p> 
Targets small businesses. iPayment's custome= base consists of small merchants, which typically pay higher 
transaction=0D fees than large merchants due to greater business risk, lower volume=, and difficulty in identifying them. 
Thus, iPayment can generate better=margins by collecting the higher fees, while still receiving lower process=ng costs by 
aggregating small merchant transactions to receive large= volume discounts from their primary payment processor, First 
Data.=/o:p> 
A=quisitive focus. iPayment has typically used exc=ss cash flow to make acquisitions to grow its portfolio and mitigate 
=attrition, which can be meaningful given the higher failure rate in the sm=ll business market. We believe they have 
been successful with their acqu=sition strategy, having completed numerous transactions in recent years.=o:p> 
Unconventional ownership. Carl Grimstad, iPay=ent's Chairman and CEO, and his affiliations own all of iPayment 
Holding=. However, he also has a vested interest in ensuring the success o= the business and is likely to carefully 
consider how his potential action= may impact the company and his stake. 
Regulatory impact. Since the implementation of the Durbin legislation in Octobe= 2011, margins for processors and 
merchant acquirers have benefitted=from lower interchange fee expenses. However, as they continue to pass t=e 
savings onto more merchants, merchant discount fees will continue to dec=ine, closing the gap between the top-line 
and lower interchange expenses=2E 
Industry competition. There are a number o= companies looking to get into the payments business using new 
technology=0D including digital wallets, near field communications, and mobile car= readers. However, we believe there 
will be little in the way of change =or merchant acquirers such as iPayment in the medium term. 
Bottom line. We expect iPayment to contin=e to maintain its top line and generate healthy margins with total l=verage 
levels of —7.2x. Although the ownership structure is unconventi=nal, we believe the company has a good management 
team, focused on control=ing attrition and growing the portfolio with acquisitions. iPayment's =OA bonds offer very 
attractive relative value, with the iPayment, Inc. 1=.25% notes due 2018 offering a yield of 13.34% and the iPayment 
Holdin=s 15% PIK notes due 2018 offering a yield of 20.91%. Given industry tr=nds, the company's competitive 
positioning, and these yields, we r=commend that investors buy iPayment bonds.
