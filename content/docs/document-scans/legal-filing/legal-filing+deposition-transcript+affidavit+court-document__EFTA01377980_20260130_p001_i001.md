Our success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and on our ability to enhance, expand and adapt these systems 
and infrastructures in a timely and cost-effective manner. 
In order for us to succeed, our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis. From time to time, we may experience system 
interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable and prevent our products from functioning property for our users: any such interruption 
could arise for any number of reasons. Further, our systems and infrastructures are vulnerable to damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failures 
and similar events. %Mille we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, our systems and infrastructures are not hilly redundant, 
disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities and our property and business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to 
compensate us fully for any losses that we may suffer. Any interruptions or outages, regardless of the cause, could negatively impact our users' experiences 
with our products, tarnish our brands reputation and decrease demand for our products. any or all of which could adversely affect our business. financial 
condition and results of operations. 
We also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems to improve the experience of our users, 
accommodate substantial increases in the volume of traffic to our various dating products and to keep up with changes in technology and user preference. 
Any failure to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect our users experience with our various products and thereby negatively impact 
the demand for our products, and could increase our costs, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We are currently undertaking a significant and complex update to the technology relating to some of our businesses, and failure to complete this 
project in a timely and effective manner could adversely affect our business. 
We are currently in the process of an ongoing consolidation and streamlining of the technology and network systems and infrastructures of a number of our 
businesses, including Match, Ourtme and Meetic. The goal or this project is to modernize, optimize and improve the scalability and cost-effectiveness of 
these systems and infrastructures and to increase our ability to deploy product changes more rapidly across devices and product lines. We have budgeted 
significant human and financial resources for these efforts and if we experience delays, inefficiencies or operational failures, we will Incur additional costs, 
which would adversely affect our profitability. Moreover, these efforts may not be successful generally, may not be completed in a timely or cost-effective 
manner, may not result in the cost savings or other benefits we anticipate and may disrupt operations, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, 
financial condition and results of operations. 
We may not be able to protect our systems and infrastructures from cyber attacks and may be adversely affected by cyber attacks experienced by 
third parties. 
We are regularly under attack by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious technology-related events, such as cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or 
other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card 
information. Mile we have invested heavily in the protection of our systems and infrastructures and in related training, there can be no assurance that our 
efforts will prevent significant breaches in our systems or other such events from occumng. Any cyber or similar attack we are unable to protect ourselves 
against could damage our systems and infrastructure, prevent us from providing our products, erode our reputation and brands, result in the disclosure of 
confidential information of our users and/or be costly to remedy.

service providers, in connection with the provision of our products generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users. We have 
no control over any of these third parties or their operations. 
Problems experienced by third party data center service providers upon whom we rely, the telecommunications network providers with whom they contract or 
with the systems through which telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers could also adversely affect us. Any changes in service 
levels at our data centers or any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of 
these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products or process transactions with our users, which would adversely impact our business, financial 
condition and results of operations.

persons, it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event and our reputation could be harmed.
