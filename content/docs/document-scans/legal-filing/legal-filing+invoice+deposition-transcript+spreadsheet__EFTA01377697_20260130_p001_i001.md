Cash Flows Related to Square Capital 
Prior to the third quarter of 2014. we funded our MCAs to our sellers from our balance sheet. The majority of funding for 
Square Capital currently comes from third parties who commit to purchase the future receivables related to Square Capital. We do 
not anticipate significant increases in the use of our cash to fund MCAs in future periods.
