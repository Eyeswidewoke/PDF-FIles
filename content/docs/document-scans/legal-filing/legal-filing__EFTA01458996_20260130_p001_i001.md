World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
The ghosts of EM crises past: equity over•allocation to EM has been 
completely unwound; EM FX to have overshot the relative growth slowdown; 
waiting for the Fed. Past EM crises occurred when US dollar up cycles (3/4 of 
the way through) coincided with US rate hiking cycles. Key difference now is 
that EM FX has already depreciated. EM growth normalization explains well 
the underperformance of EM equities and fall of EM FX. EM absolute growth is 
now back to the middle of its historical range while relative growth is still a bit 
high. In terms of allocations, the equity over allocation to EM has been 
completely unwound. Bond allocations are lower but the potential for more 
downside on a broader unwind of fixed income over allocations remains. EM 
FX has overshot. We would look to go long EM once US rates re-price for the 
rate hiking cycle. 
Asset allocation and trades: 
Overweight equities; underweight bonds, cash and commodities, long the 
dollar 
a 
Within equities. we would overweight the US and Japan, neutral Europe, 
underweight EM (until Fed re-pricing). 
• 
Expect mid-cycle price gains for US equities (+13%) on solid demand-
supply, strong underlying earnings growth as dollar drag recedes, 
valuations slightly below fair value; similar appreciation in Europe but 
higher risk as the largest consensus overweight and relative valuations at 
the expensive end; more in Japan (+18%) as steep valuation discount 
dissipates: less in EM (6%) as relative growth slows further and higher US 
rates and dollar pressures spreads. 
We look for higher lOy yields (+75bps) as markets gradually move toward 
pricing in Fed's path of rate normalization. A higher terminal rate and risk 
premium could mean additional pressure in the future. We are 
underweight duration and prefer HY over HG for larger spread 
compression as rates rise. 
Trades: 
The Fed to move faster: steepeners at the short end (EDZ7 - EDZ6) 
It's all about inflation: Short Euribor Dec 2018 futures 
Equity recoveries from 10%+ corrections are strong: Long S&P 500 
March 2016 risk reversals 
As rates catch up to the dollar: Long Financials short Energy 
Excessive defensive premium to erode: short Consumer Staples 
Long US-centric dollar beneficiary stocks 
Stay short copper: supply to add to overvaluation pressure.
