2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82496, * 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants engaged in an unlawful, undisclosed kickback 
scheme, colluding to charge borrowers rates the borrowers believed were necessary to 
cover their insurance costs but which were actually used to fund kickbacks to Statebridge, 
among other improper benefits. These rates were higher than the voluntary rates 
borrowers were able to obtain on the open market, but Plaintiff does not allege that they 
were unreasonable in absolute terms. Rather, Plaintiff objects to Defendants' allegedly 
wrongful conduct, which "was neither filed with, nor approved by, the state regulatory 
agency and thus fell firmly outside the scope of the filed rate doctrine." (Plaintiffs Opp. to 
SMTD. Dkt. No. 23 ("Pl.'s Opp.") at 10) 
Under New Jersey law, "every insurer shall, before using or applying any rate' to any kind 
of insurance, file with the commissioner a copy of the rating-system° upon which such rate 
is based, or by which such rate is fixed or determined." N.J.S.A. 17:29A-6. "No insurer . . 
shall give false or misleading information . . . to the commissioner, which will in any 
manner affect the proper determination of [98] reasonable, adequate, and 
nondiscriminatory rates." N.J.S.A. 17:29A-16. 
It, after examination thereof, the commissioner shall find that such rating-systems filed by or on behalf of an insurer 
provide for, result in, or produce rates that are unreasonably high or excessive. or are not adequate for the safeness 
and soundness of the insurer, or are unfairly discriminatory between risks in this State involving essentially the same 
hazards and expense elements, he shall issue an order to such insurer 
directing that such rating-systems be 
altered in the manner and to the extent stated in such order, to produce rates that are reasonable and adequate, and 
not unfairly discriminatory. . .. [Otherwise.) he shall approve such rates[.) 
N.J.S.A. 17:29A-7.° 
7 'Rate' means the unit charge by which the measure of exposure or the amount of insurance specified in a pokey of instance 
or covered thereunder is multiplied to determine the premium." N.J.SA. 17:29A-1(a). 
8 'Rating-system' means every schedule, class. classification, rule, guide, standard, manual table, rating plan, or compilation. 
by whatever name described, containing the rates used by any rating organization or by any insurer, or used by any insurer or 
by any rating organization in determining ['19] or ascertaining a rate and includes any policy form, or part thereof, used 
therewith.' N.J.S.A 17:29A-1(d). 
9 in making such determination, the commissioner shall consider the factors applied by insurers and rating organizations 
generally in determining the bases for rates: the financial condition of the insurer: the method of operation of such insurer: the 
loss experience of the insurer, past and prospective, including where pertinent, the conflagration and catastrophe hazards. if 
any, both within and without this State: to all factors reasonably related to the kind of insurance involved: to a reasonable profit 
for the insurer, and in the case of participating insurers, to policyholders' dividends.' N.J.S. A. 17:29A-11 
Once a rate is approved, "[n]o insurer . . . shall knowingly charge, demand or receive a 
premium for any policy of insurance except in accordance with the respective rating-
systems on file with and approved by the commissioner." N.J.S.A. 17:29A-15. 
Here, Statebridge's filed rating-system was approved, and the rate that Statebridge 
charged Plaintiff complied with the rate on file. However, there is no evidence that 
Defendants included in their application for approval of their ratingsystem the portion of the 
premium devoted to kickbacks, [° 20] as Plaintiff has alleged. Such extraneous payments 
are forbidden as follows: 
No insurer . . . shall pay. allow. or give. or offer to pay, allow. or give. directly or indirectly, as an inducement to 
insurance, or after insurance has been effected. any rebate. discount. abatement, credit, or reduction of the premium
