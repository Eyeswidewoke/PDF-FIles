HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
or otherwise including a voluntary termination of the financing by the Levered Feeder Fund. 
Alternatively, the Management Company may direct an Underlying Fund to borrow 
additional capital from its current credit providers solely on behalf of a Levered Feeder Fund. In 
such case, an Underlying Fund would allocate any returns (and associated costs) attributable to 
that additional leverage only to the Levered Feeder Fund and, unless the lenders agree to ring-
fence the collateral in connection with such borrowing (so that it includes only the assets 
attributable to the Levered Feeder Fund), a cross-collateralization risk will exist with respect to all 
borrowings of the Underlying Fund. The amount of leverage attributable to a Levered Feeder 
Fund (and any other Feeder Funds) will be determined by the Management Company in good faith 
and may change from time to time. 
In addition, certain of the structures described above may diminish the amount of capital 
that can be borrowed from credit providers for the benefit of the investors in the other Feeder 
Funds (other than a Levered Feeder Fund) or the Partnership. 
Liability of the Partnership and the Underlying Funds 
Each of the Partnership and each Underlying Fund is a single legal entity and there is no 
limited recourse protection for any class, tranche, series or sub-series of interests or shares, as 
applicable. Generally, creditors of the Partnership may enforce claims against all assets of the 
Partnership, but not against assets of an Underlying Fund, and creditors of an Underlying Fund 
may enforce claims against all assets of such Underlying Fund, but not against assets of the 
Partnership. However, all assets of the Partnership, including its interest/shares in an Underlying 
Fund, may be available to meet all liabilities of the Partnership, and all assets of an Underlying 
Fund may be available to meet all liabilities of such Underlying Fund, even if, in either case, the 
liability relates to a particular Feeder Fund or Capital Account, class, tranche, series or sub-series 
of interests or shares of the Partnership or an Underlying Fund, as the case may be (tg,., new issues 
and any corresponding hedge positions). Thus, for example, in the event that the assets attributable 
to Capital Accounts participating in a security were completely depleted by losses or liabilities, a 
creditor could enforce a claim against the assets of the Partnership which would be borne by the 
other Capital Accounts that did not participate in the investment or transaction. In addition, in 
order to facilitate investments or financing, the Partnership may guarantee certain obligations of 
the Master Fund or one or more of its affiliates. In such circumstances all of the assets of the 
guarantor generally will be available to satisfy the guaranty obligation. A similar risk could arise 
if another Feeder Fund which invests in the Underlying Fund does so with more leverage than the 
Partnership. Such arrangements may expose the Partnership to an increased risk of loss. 
Legal and Regulatory Environment for Private Investment Funds and their Managers 
The legal, tax and regulatory environment worldwide for private investment funds (such 
as the Partnership) and their managers is evolving. Changes in the regulation of private investment 
funds, their managers, and their trading and investing activities may have a material adverse effect 
on the ability of the Underlying Funds to pursue their investment program and the value of 
investments held by the Underlying Funds. There has been an increase in scrutiny of the private 
investment fund industry by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. New laws 
and regulations or actions taken by regulators that restrict the ability of the Underlying Funds to
