- similarities and vocabulary tests are classical Al and =omputational linguistics 
- information is close to IBM's Watson (recognition and =nference) 
The only thing that looks interesting to me in the WAIS is the =omprehension test, because I don't see a straightforward 
approach to =heat on them with narrow Al. I would like to expand exactly this =omain: making sense of the world. 
We don't have advanced problem solving ("these are the rules for chess. =ow would you try to beat a beginner level 
player, a medium player, a =op player most quickly?"). We don't have constructive abilities. We =on't have verbal 
creativity etc. 
Please tell me if my take on the WAIS is wrong! 
> How do you know for sure what the "basics" are? 
While the literal understanding of the Turing Test leads nowhere (or, =ell, to the Loebner prize), I think that he had the 
right idea. =ntelligence is reflected in the ability to participate in meaningful =iscourse, which includes interpreting and 
creatively structuring the =orld. Many of the things that the WAIS measures, like recognizing and =ategorizing shapes, 
are prerequisites for that. Others might be =cquired tastes that emerge on more basic functionality, like mental 
=rithmetic. But a toolbox is not an architecture. A collection of tubes, =ires, pedals and spokes is not a bicycle. 
Some of the basics stem directly from the requirements of producing =dequate representations of perceptual and 
abstracted content (hybrid =ierarchical representations that can do associations, compositional =tuff, grammatical 
systematicity, learning and categorization, =nheritance etc.). Others come from the needs to get the processes of 
=ottom-up/top-down perception, reflection, memory retrieval, inference, =nalogy building etc. to work. And some have 
to do with the requirements =f translating between Mentalese (in Pinker's sense, not in Fodor's) and =atural language. 
I may delude myself in thinking that I know what the basics are. In =act, it is extremely likely that I do (every computer 
science problem =eems to be misconceptualized until it has been properly implemented). =ut I would start with mental 
representation, perceptual processing and =otivational relevance, and then go for language, while revisiting those =reas 
that turn out to fall short. 
> Forget about the Raven; it's a non-verbal test of fluid intelligence =which in fact turns out to have, by accident not 
design, two different =ypes of items -- solved by spatial vs. analytic strategies). The Raven =oes not even begin to 
characterize all of what is captured by the WAIS 
It might well be that I totally misunderestimate the WAIS requirements; = will look at them. 
» I agree. But I am not convinced that proper emotions are absolutely =ecessary for Intelligence (motivation might 
suffice to drive some kind =f non-emotional, serene Buddha intelligence). I am nevertheless =nterested in understanding 
and modeling them. 
> I think Antonio Damasio and his successors have made a very good case =hat emotion plays a key role in reasoning. 
(Not just motivation, actual =motion.) 
Most of what I would say against that has been better expressed by Aaron =loman. For instance, if my computer is prone 
to swapping memory content =o hard drive and back, and I kill the part of the OS that coordinates =he swapping, my 
computer is likely to malfunction. But from this I =annot infer that computers cannot work without swapping. 
0amasio's argument does not convince me because he does not elucidate a =unctional role that would emotion an 
absolute requirement for an =rtificial mind. Lesion studies amount to shutting down parts of an =perating system that 
has been designed to cope with very specific =equirements. I believe that in humans, emotions structure social 
=nteraction, support communication, prime memory and cognitive =rocessing, and most importantly, allocate the scarce 
resources of our =ind according to the current situation. None of this is necessary if I =emove the resource constraints.
