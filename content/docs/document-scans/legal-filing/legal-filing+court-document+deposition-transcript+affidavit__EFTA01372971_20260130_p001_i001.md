15 The Issuer will continue to use ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies to obligors on individual Collateral Obligations. Such ratings 
will primarily be public ratings and private ratings. A credit rating of an asset such as a Collateral Obligation represents the rating 
agency's opinion regarding its credit quality and is not a guarantee of quality or performance. A credit rating is not a recommendation 
to buy. sell or hold assets and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. In the event that a 
rating assigned to any Collateral Obligation is lowered for any reason, no party is obligated to provide any additional support or credit 
enhancement with respect to such Collateral Obligation. Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the safety of principal and interest 
payments and do not evaluate the risks of fluctuations in market value. Therefore, ratings may not fully reflect the true risks of an 
investment in any Collateral Obligation Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to 
subsequent events, so that an obligor's current financial condition may be better or worse than indicated by a rating. Consequently. 
credit ratings of any Collateral Obligation are only a preliminary indicator of investment quality and not a completely reliable 
assurance of investment quality. A Rating Agency may change its published ratings criteria or methodologies for loans and loan 
interests such as the Collateral Obligations at any time in the future. Furthermore. a Rating Agency may retroactively apply any such 
new standards to the ratings of the Collateral Obligations. Any such action codd result in a substantial lowering or a withdrawal of 
any rating assigned to a Collateral Obligation.
