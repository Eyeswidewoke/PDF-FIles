2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
B. The settlement terms 
1. Relief for N14 Class members 
If the Court grants final approval to the settlement agreement, Defendants agree to dismiss 
this action with prejudice with respect to al/ Plaintiffs, and N14 Class members "will be 
forever barred and enjoined ['8] from pursuing any claims" resolved by the settlement. Id. 
at 16, 31-33. 
In consideration, Defendants have agreed to provide N14 Class members with four 
primary types of relief. First, N14 Class Vehicles will receive a warranty extension for the 
timing-chain tensioner and timing chain for seven years or 100,000 miles from the date 
when the vehicle was first placed into service, whichever comes first, subject to certain 
exceptions. Id. Second, N14 Class members who submit claims by the relevant deadlines 
are entitled to reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred before the effective 
settlement date for repair and/or replacement of the timing chain and/or timing-chain 
tensioner, subject to certain limitations. Id. at 17-18. Class members are entitled to 100% 
of costs incurred at authorized MINI dealers and up to $120 for timing-chain tensioners 
and $850 for timing chains repaired or replaced at independent service centers. Id. Third, 
N14 Class members who submit timely claims are entitled to reimbursement for up to 
$4,500 in out-of-pocket expenses incurred before the effective settlement date for repair 
and/or replacement of an engine because of timing-chain tensioner and/or timing chain 
failure, subject to r9i discounts based on mileage and the amount of time since their 
vehicle was first placed into service, as well as certain other limitations. Id. at 19-20. 
Finally, N14 Class members who submit timely claims are entitled to compensation of up 
to $2,250 if they had to sell their vehicle at a loss before the effective settlement date due 
to an unrepaired damaged or failed engine caused by timing-chain tensioner and/or timing 
chain failure, again subject to discounts based on mileage and the time since their vehicle 
was first placed into service, as well as certain other limitations. Id. at 21-22. 
The settlement requires N14 Class members to complete and submit a claim form, either 
online or by mailing a hard copy, providing information and documentation about their N14 
Vehicle(s), routine maintenance, repairs, and sale. P. Mot. Final Approval Settlement 
Agreement, ECF No. 92 at 15; see also Notice and Claim Form, Decl. Matthew J. 
McDermott in Support Mot. Approve Settlement ("McDermott Declaration"), ECF No. 92-4

Administrator will review each timely claim and initially decide whether to grant or deny 
each claim. ECF No. 92 at riot 15; ECF No. 92-4 Ex. A § K. Granted claims will be 
submitted to Defendants for final approval. ECF No. 92 at 15-16; Settlement Agreement 
and Release, ECF No. 69-3 Ex. 1 ¶ III.E.2. The Settlement Administrator will notify each 
Class member whose claim is denied, in whole or in part, of the reason for the denial and

92 at 15; ECF No. 69-3 Ex. 1 11III.E.1. Class members who cannot cure the deficiencies 
may notify Class Counsel of their wish to appeal the denial, eventually submitting any
