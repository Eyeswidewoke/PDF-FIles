"ByteDance's proposals to address concerns, including a nonbinding letter of intent to sell to 
Microsoft presented earlier July 30, according to the lawsuit." 
The Los Angeles Times (8/24, Lee, 4.64M) reports TikTok "said it has worked with the 
government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States for nearly a year and 
believes its app does not threaten national security." NPR (8/24, Allyn, 3.12M) reports TikTok 
says the order was not motivated by national security concerns but an attempt "to further the 
president's anti-China political campaign." In the suit, TikTok "points out that national security 
experts have openly questioned whether its lighthearted videos can really provide much 
intelligence to Beijing authorities." 
The Hill (8/24, Wise, 2.98M) reports according to the "lawsuit, many TikTok employees 
working in the U.S. have H-1B visas, which require that employers sponsor their visa status." 
TikTok's own lawsuit "noted it is planning to hire roughly 10,000 additional employees in the 
U.S. in the coming years." 
Bloomberg (8/24, Pettersson, Glovin, Brody, 4.73M) reports the legal challenge faces "an 
uphill fight, according to James Dempsey, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and 
Technology at the University of California, Berkeley." Courts don't generally review "the 
president's determinations on questions of national security, Dempsey said." 
Newsweek (8/24, Watts, 1.53M) also shared the full statement by TikTok. Also reporting 
are USA Today (8/24, Brown, 10.31M), CNBC (8/24, Sherman, 3.62M), and The Washington 
Examiner (8/24, Dunleavy, 448K). 
Zoom Experienced Outages During First Day Of School For Many. 
The CBS Evening NewsVI (8/24, story 17, 0:20, O'Donnell, 4.32M) reported on Monday, 
"meetings, classrooms, and virtual visits came to a halt after videoconferencing giant Zoom was 
hit with outages. Service was down for close to five hours, delaying the first day of online 
school for thousands of students." The AP (8/24) reports Zoom said reports of outages began 
"around 9 a.m. Eastern time" and "identified the issue causing the problem and is working on a 
fix." The Washington Post (8/24, Shaban, Balingit, 14.2M) reports "more than 100,000 K-12 
schools use Zoom at no cost for online learning." The Wall Street Journal (8/24, Needleman, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M) and New York Times (8/24, Yuhas, 18.61M), among other 
news outlets, also reports the outage.

Interior Department Announces Increased Seizures Of Illegal Drugs. 
The Washington Times (8/24, Richardson, 492K) reports that the Administration "announced 
Monday that seizures of illegal narcotics in Indian Country doubled last year as part of the 
administration's effort to combat the opioid crisis." The Interior Department's Joint Opioid 
Reduction Task Force "said that its 14 operations in seven states in 2019 resulted in the 
confiscation of 2,607 pounds of illegal narcotics with an estimated street value of $19.6 million." 
That was "more than double the price tag from the previous year," the department said in a 
press release. Interior Secretary David L. Bernhardt said, "Our Bureau of Indian Affairs officers 
successfully stopped thousands of pounds of deadly narcotics from reaching tribal communities 
last year, and they continue to serve with distinction every day. In a time when people are 
calling to defund the police, the Trump Administration is doing more to protect our citizens from 
illicit drugs and violence."
