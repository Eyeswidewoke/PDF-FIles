assure investors that litigation costs will not exceed expected amounts or that adverse publicity 
won't be obtained. If an issuer fails to meet its contractual obligations, in addition to the possibility 
of being involved in costly litigation, an Underlying Fund may be unable to dispose of the 
Securities at appropriate prices, if at all, or may experience substantial delays in doing so, and thus 
the Underlying Fund may not be able to realize the anticipated profit with respect to such 
investment for a substantial period of time, if ever. There can be no assurances that any issuer will 
succeed in registering for public resale the Securities held by the Underlying Fund or that 
registration of Securities pursuant to any such arrangement will create liquidity. 
In connection with its sales of Securities purchased pursuant to Regulation D or otherwise 
exempt from registration, an Underlying Fund could be deemed to be a "statutory underwriter" 
based on the method and timing of such sales. If an Underlying Fund were deemed to be a 
"statutory underwriter," it could have an adverse effect on the transaction(s) in respect of which 
such determination is made and, possibly, on the Underlying Fund's ability to continue to 
effectively pursue this investment strategy. An Underlying Fund could be held jointly and 
severally liable with the issuer to the persons purchasing Securities from it for damages based upon 
misstatements or omissions of material facts in a prospectus or oral communication delivered or 
made in connection with such offer or sale. An Underlying Fund relies on certain exemptions 
from the SEC's registration requirements to sell its restricted securities, including Rule 144 of the 
Securities Act. Under Rule 144, before selling any restricted securities, an Underlying Fund may 
be obligated to hold them for at least six months, provided that the issuer is subject to, and has 
complied with, the reporting requirements of the Securities Act. If the issuer is not subject to the 
reporting requirements of the Securities Act, then an Underlying Fund may be required to hold the 
restricted securities for at least one year before they can be sold in the market. There may be 
circumstances where restricted securities will never become freely tradeable (i.e., if the issuer was 
a "shell" company and is not complying with the reporting requirements). The law regarding the 
resale of restricted securities can change, and in the past has changed. There can be no assurance 
that future changes will not adversely affect an Underlying Fund's ability to resell its restricted 
securities. 
An Underlying Fund may purchase Securities alongside other third party investors, and 
may coordinate efforts with such third parties in negotiating the terms of such Securities. Although 
an Underlying Fund will generally take actions designed to prevent it from being deemed a 
member of a "group" with such other investors for purposes of Sections 13 and 16 of the Exchange 
Act and related provisions, there is no guarantee that a regulatory body will not deem the parties 
negotiating such terms to constitute a "group." In the event that an Underlying Fund's conduct in 
these situations gives rise to such "group" status, it may be deemed to beneficially own all equity 
securities of the issuer beneficially owned by the other group members. Such beneficial ownership 
may, in turn, trigger certain regulatory filings and may cause the Underlying Fund to be deemed 
an "affiliate" of the issuer pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, which, as described above, 
would subject the Underlying Fund to, among other things, certain limitations on the amount of 
Securities it can sell in such issuer's Securities. In situations where the Underlying Fund does not 
deem itself to be a member of a "group," but a regulator takes a different view, it could lead to 
regulatory action against the Underlying Fund for violation of the applicable provisions of the 
Exchange Act.
