US Fixed Income Weekly 
From a trade recommendations perspective, we maintain our long 5Y 
breakevens as the macro backdrop is increasingly supportive for the trade. 
Moreover, we see upside risks to the consensus HICP print of next week. 
We also shift our short 2Y1Y eonia into a simple short 3y eonia as the curve up 
to December 16 is now fully pricing the increase in liquidity (forward eonias 
around -15bp). If anything, there is a risk that because of market frictions, 
eonia does not trade as low in the corridor. For instance, eonia is proving 
relatively sticky given the current level of excess liquidity. 
We exit the long 30Y BTP and move instead into an optimised cross-market 
steepener. We enter a long 7Y BTP to protect against the potential impact of 
the supply response on the long-end. Even if the most recent price action 
reverses, the volatility of the long-end of the curve makes this sector less 
compelling from a Sharpe ratio perspective. The 7 year point is the most 
attractive from a (volatility adjusted) carry and roll down perspective. At the 
same time, it is attractive to test a short in 30Y core rates given (a) the flatness 
of core curves, (b) the risk of unwind of Japanese portfolios and/or supply 
response from France and (c) the upside risks to the next inflation print. We 
therefore recommend a 7Y BTP - 30Y France cross-market steepener. 
Finally, we maintain the Bund ASW widener as a hedge against renewed 
tensions in Greece. 
Still looking for more risk premium in the US 
In the US, the hard data continues to disappoint leading tracking GDPs below 
1%. On the more positive side, the jobless claims have remained resilient and 
some of the business surveys have improved. In any case, the Fed and the 
market have already adjusted for a weak Q1 GDP, and the inflation outlook 
remains the key driver. From this perspective, the relative weakness of the 
USD and rise in oil prices should be supportive of a greater risk premium in US 
rates. For instance, USD 10Y Breakevens are low relative to oil prices, metal 
prices and DXY (see graph below). From a trade recommendation perspective, 
we continue to favour USD2s5s steepeners as an attractive way of positioning 
for steeper money market curves. The trade remains at risk from a renewed 
USD strength and/or oil price weakness. However, given the flatness of the 
money market curve (around 50bp priced between dec-16 and dec-17), the 
downside risks to the trade are limited. 
The risk premium remains close to the historical lows
