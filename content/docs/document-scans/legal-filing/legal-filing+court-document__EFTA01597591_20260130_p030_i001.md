address online through UBS Online Services or by calling your Financial Advisor.

Enrollment in e-Delivery is effective immediately and may be cancelled at any time, 
either by changing your elections online or by contacting your Financial Advisor; we

notice that a document is available with instructions on how to access it.

Householding of Statements and Other Communications 
As a convenience to you, we may consolidate periodic communications for certain accounts 
with the same address. This practice, called "householding", applies to account statements, 
trade confirmations, remittance transfer receipts, personal and financial information required 
to be sent by regulation, preliminary and final prospectuses and Summary of Accounts 
statements, which provide consolidated information for all of the Accounts in your household. 
Households are determined as follows: 
• 
Accounts that share the same name, address and Social Security or Tax ID Number 
are automatically placed in the same household. 
• 
Accounts that share only the same address will be placed in the same household 
only with the express consent of all the Account holders. 
We mail househeld communications in a single envelope (if you receive paper delivery) or, if 
you receive electronic delivery, we make them available through UBS Online Services or other 
electronic delivery method. Any member of your household who is enrolled in UBS Online 
Services can have access to view all Accounts in the household. 
The composition of a household will change as clients move away from the household mailing 
address, and the addressee for househeld mailings may also change over time. Where owners 
of joint accounts live at different addresses, househeld mailings will be sent to at least one 
Account owner's address and may be included with mailings for other Accounts at that 
address under the conditions described above. 
N you do not want your statements robe 
bundled by household, please contact your 
Financial Advisor. 
For more information regarding electronic 
delivery of periodic communication for your 
Account, please refer to the Electronic 
Delivery Agreement herein.
