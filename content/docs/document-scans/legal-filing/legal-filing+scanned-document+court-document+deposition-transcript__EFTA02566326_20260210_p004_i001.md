Below is the summary we =eceived from the attorney. Let me know when you want to =peak. 
Thank you. 
Drew 
The memorandum Drew =enenson asked us to review looks at two issues with regard to the sales =ax 
consequences of a proposed transfer of art from a (defective) =rantor trust to the grantor, apparently in exchange for 
stock of the =rantor. The issues are: (1) whether a grantor trust =disregarded for federal income tax purposes) is 
recognized as a =eparate entity for sales tax purposes in a transaction with the =rantor; and (2) if so, whether its 
existence could be disregarded =nstead on a common-law alter-ego theory. 
The memo correctly =oints out that there is no direct guidance on the sales tax obligations =f grantor trusts. 
However, ample authority does exist with =espect to other federally disregarded entities-namely, single-member =LCs 
(SMLLCs)-and it confirms that New York considers an entity's =disregarded" status for federal income tax purposes to be 
irrelevant =ith respect to its sales tax obligations. Numerous rulings have =ound SMLLCs subject to sales tax obligations, 
whether in transactions =ith third parties or with their sole member. See, e.g., Arthur =nderson, TSB-A-99(7)S, Jan. 28, 
1999 (ruling that leases of tangible =roperty between a federal disregarded SMLLC and its sole member-a C =orporation-
were taxable retail sales on which the SMLLC was obligated =o collect tax); M Ventures, LLC, TSB-A-04(11)S, April 27, 
2004 (ruling =hat aircraft leases between two SMLLC's owned by the same single member =ould be subject to tax but for 
an exemption for certain commercial =ircraft). 
The memo cites several New York rulings involving =ransactions among affiliated entities (including SMLLCs). 
The =epartment qualified its findings in those rulings by noting that the =nalysis presumed that the affiliated companies 
didn't "so dominate the =ffairs" of one another to be considered mere alter-egos of each other =nder common-law 
tests. But this language alone does not indicate, =s the memo suggests, that the mere structure of a defective grantor 
=rust obligates the Department to disregard the separate legal existence =f the trust and the grantor in a transaction 
between the two. In =act, similar language appears in numerous other sales tax rulings =nvolving complex corporate 
structures and their sales tax =onsequences-be it C corporations, partnerships or SMLLCs. Like an =ndividual, any trust 
(acting through its trustee) is, by statute, =onsidered a "person" subject to sales tax obligations under Tax Law § =101(a). 
More critically, the doctrine of piercing the corporate =eil (which the memo concludes could work to eliminate 
the tax here) is =ot one a taxpayer may generally invoke to avoid unfavorable tax =onsequences. As the Appellate 
Division has held: the =asserted right" to pierce the corporate veil "is not usually invoked by =he stockholder but by one 
claiming against him and seeking to avoid the =erpetration of a fraud under the cover of the corporate veil." 
=nbsp;(Orda v State Tax Commission, 25 A.D.2d 332, affd, 19 N.Y.2d 636). =nbsp;ln fact, New York's Court of Appeals 
stated in Morris v. New York =ept. of Taxation & Fin., 82 N.Y.2d 135 (1993) (a sales tax case) =hat: 
While complete domination of the corporation is the key to =iercing the corporate veil, especially when the 
owners use the =orporation as a mere device to further their personal rather than the =orporate business, such 
domination, standing alone, is not enough; some =howing of a wrongful or unjust act toward plaintiff is required. 82 
=.Y.2d at 141-42. (emphasis added) (citations omitted). 
Here, the =rantor trust was ostensibly set up for legitimate business and/or =state planning purposes. 
Therefore, New York's position with =egard to any transaction between the trust and its grantor would =eflect the 
widely applied concept that a taxpayer must bear the sales =ax consequences of its chosen form of doing business. As 
stated =y the Appellate Division, "the choice of form [does] not rest with the =ax authorities but with the taxpayer. If he 
unfortunately chose a =orm which was taxable instead of an equally available form which was =ontaxable, he must bear 
the consequences." (Sverdlow v. Bates, 283 A.D. =87, 491; see also 107 Delaware Associates et al. v. State Tax Comm'n, 
=9 A.D.2d 29 (1984); Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Moline =roperties, Inc., 131 F.2d 388 (1942).
