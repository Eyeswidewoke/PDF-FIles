defense of estoppel by waiver; and (3) the circuit court should have found it 
unconscionable to hold the Swentos liable under an agreement to which they were not a 
party. For the following reasons, we affirm.
I. Background 
CEC is the owner of a shopping center in Des Plaines, Illinois, and leases r*31 spaces in 
the shopping center to commercial tenants. On July 8, 1991, CEC's predecessor, Rubloff, 
Inc. (Rubloff), as agent for the beneficiary of American National Bank and Trust Company 
of Chicago Trust No. 14834 (Land Trust), entered into a lease agreement (the lease) as 
landlord with Swento & Company, Inc., as tenant of "Space 13" at the shopping center. 
Swento & Company, Inc., which was owned [*6O2] and operated by the Swentos, was in 
the business of family fun entertainment as a franchise business that included an indoor 
amusement park which specialized in holding birthday parties with rides, games and a 
restaurant. The lease term was for 129 months from the date of the lease and the lease 
contained a financing contingency period that expired on August 8, 1991. 
Contemporaneous to the execution of the lease, to induce the landlord to enter into the 
lease with Swento & Company, Inc., the Swentos executed a personal guaranty that 
provided for their joint and several liability for all of the tenant's obligations under the lease. 
The personal guaranty provided that the Swentos guaranteed "the payment of all Rent and 
other charges to be paid by Tenant and the performance by Tenant of all the [*am] terms, 
conditions, covenants and agreements of the said Lease and the [Swentos] promis[e] to 
pay all the Landlord's expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, incurred 
by the Landlord in enforcing all obligations of Tenant under the Lease or incurred by 
Landlord in enforcing this guaranty." 
The personal guaranty also provided: 
r133) "This guaranty is irrevocable, absolute, present. continuing and unconditional, and the obligation of (the 
Swentos) shag not be released or affected by (a) any extensions of time. indulgences or modifications vitich Landlord 
may extend with Tenant in the performance of said Lease; (b) any failure of Landlord to enforce any of the conditions of 
said Lease: (c) any assignment of the Lease by Tenant: or (0) any consent which Landlord may give to such 
assignment." 
In addition, the personal guaranty provided that the "guaranty shall also inure to the benefit 
of Landlord's successors, assigns, and legal representatives." 
On August 7, 1991, the parties executed a "First Amendment to Lease," in which the 
financing contingency period was extended to October 1, 1991. Pursuant to the 
amendment, all other terms of the lease remained the same. The amendment also [**.5] 
provided: 
"Harvey Swento and Cherry L. Swento have executed this First Amendment to Lease to reaffirm their obligations under 
that certain Personal Guaranty dated as of July 8. 1991. in favor of Landlord." 
On January 24, 1992, the parties executed a "Second Amendment to Lease," which 
changed the total square footage of the leased space by reducing the size of the rented 
area. The amendment also reduced the fixed minimum rent, annualized gross sales base, 
initial monthly estimated "CAM" payments, initial monthly estimated tax payment, and
