Large numbers of children are being raised in single-parent families. This is 
an ideal situation for the seduction-acquaintance child molester. Many working 
parents are desperate for affordable daycare and readily available babysitters. Many 
parents are not only not suspicious of adults who want to spend time with their 
children, but they welcome them. Parents should at least be suspicious of indi-
viduals who want to be together with their children for long periods of time. 
Beware of anyone who wants to be with your children more than you do. 
Need to Defy Parents 
Many children, especially when they reach adolescence, go through a rebellious 
period. The child molester can exploit this to his advantage. Children who are 
victimized as a result of disobeying parental guidelines or rules will be reluctant 
to admit their error and may misrepresent the nature of their victimization. This 
is especially true of adolescent boys. . 
Children as Witnesses 
Many children are not.believed when they report being sexually abused and may 
be subject to harassment in court. The truth is that children are not poor wit-
nesses. Neither are they ideal witnesses. Although child witnesses have many of 
the same traits as adult witnesses, the criminal-justice system must make special 
allowances for the developmental stages of children. Information furnished by 
children must be evaluated and assessed like the information furnished by any 
other victim or witness. If possible, as an early step in this assessment, consider-
ation should be given to having a young child victim or witness evaluated by an 
objective mental-health professional in order to determine the child's 
developmental progress. This information can be of assistance in evaluating the 
information and details furnished by the child; however, this is not always 
possible or practical. 
LO ivocy-ii i 
Any law-enforcement officer assigned to the investigation of child sexual exploi-
tation should be a volunteer, even if reluctant at first, who has been carefully 
selected and trained in this highly specialized work. This kind of work is not for 
everyone. Investigators must decide for themselves if they can deal with it. Just as 
importantly the investigators working these cases must monitor themselves con-
tinually. The strong emotional reactions provoked by this work and the isolation 
and prejudice to which they may expose the investigator can make this work 
"toxic" psychologically and socially. 
Law-enforcement officers investigating the sexual 
victimization of children must learn to cope with the stigma 
within law enforcement attached to sex crime and sexual-
victimization-of-children investigations. Because there is 
so much ignorance about sex in•general and deviant sexual 
behavior specifically, fellow officers frequently joke about 
sex crime and vice investigators. This phenomenon is often 
most problematic for officers working child-sexual-
exploitation cases especially in medium or small departments. 
Investigators frequently become isolated from their peer 
group because fellow officers do not want to hear about 
Any law-enforcement officer 
assigned to the investigation 
of child sexual exploitation 
should be a volunteer, even 
if reluctant at first, who has

trained in this highly 
specialized work.
