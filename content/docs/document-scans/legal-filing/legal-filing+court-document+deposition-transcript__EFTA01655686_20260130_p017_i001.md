• CSIS: Kenya's Economic Initiatives in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — Wednesday, February 26, 2025. 
Location: Online event, 9:20 AM. Kenya's political stability and its commitment to regional peace initiatives 
have positioned it as a key player in the East African Community (EAC). By strengthening partnerships within 
the bloc, Kenya has sought to expand economically. These efforts are closely linked to its peace and security 
initiatives, as instability poses a significant challenge to economic growth in the region. Geopolitical tensions 
and regional instability threaten long-term cooperation and participation in the EAC. This is particularly 
evident as the two most recent countries admitted to the bloc are Somalia and the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo (DRC), which have been unstable for decades. 
• CSIS: Vying for Regional Leadership in the Horn of Africa: Kenya and Ethiopia Competitors or Partners? —
Wednesday, February 26, 2025. Location: Online event, 10:45 AM. The Horn of Africa remains a region of 
persistent conflict, geopolitical tensions, and weak regional cooperation, all of which shape its political and 
security landscape. Ongoing conflicts in Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, and South Sudan, along with territorial 
disputes, continue to strain relations among neighboring countries and hinder efforts toward stability. 
• Carnegie: The Future of U.S. Clean Energy — Wednesday, February 26, 2025. Location: Online event, 12:30 
PM. Over the past year, a bipartisan group of policy experts have explored how U.S. policymakers could 
strengthen clean energy supply chains around the world. This group, the U.S. Foreign Policy for Clean Energy 
Taskforce, would now like to share its data and recommendations. 
• CATO Institute: Defending Due Process — Wednesday, February 26, 2025. Location: CATO Institute, 12:00 PM. 
In a Q&A, Brandon Garrett and Vikrant Reddy will discuss the new threats that due process faces and how 
we can respond by better safeguarding fundamental liberty and property rights. They will discuss why 
people are tempted to place outcomes before fairness—in society and in the courts. They will explore how 
new technology, including artificial intelligence, has created new threats to fairness and rights. And they will 
discuss how people, from judges to local community leaders, can find common ground around defending 
due process. 
• AEI: Are China's International Test Scores Too Good to Be True? — Wednesday, February 26, 2025. Location: 
Online event, 10:45 AM. On the most recent round of the Programme for International Student Assessment 
(PISA), Chinese students' mean math and science scores were over 100 points higher than the corresponding 
averages for countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), implying 
that Chinese students are two or more years ahead of OECD pupils in these fields. But how accurate are 
these figures? A new working paper by AEI's Nicholas Eberstadt questions China's PISA scores and 
hypothesizes that the knowledge capital of China's K-12 population is on par with that of Turkey. 
• Aspen Institute: Re-Entry and Good Jobs: Building the Second Chances We All Believe In — Wednesday, 
February 26, 2025. Location: Online event, 2:00 PM. Today approximately 77 million Americans, or 1 in 3 
adults have a criminal record. While not everyone represented in this statistic has experienced incarceration, 
it serves to highlight that the barriers formerly incarcerated people face finding quality jobs are far more 
commonplace than we might think. Many returning citizens, who worked for little or no pay while 
incarcerated, will struggle to find quality jobs after release. Discrimination against those with a record, 
restrictions on what occupational licenses are available to those with a record, existing debts, punitive court 
supervision policies, and lack of support to meet basic needs in areas such as housing can force those 
leaving incarceration into dead-end, low-paying, and exploitative jobs. Some will find they are barred from 
doing the jobs they worked or were trained to do while incarcerated. And many more lacked opportunities 
to participate in education or training opportunities while incarcerated. 
• Atlantic Council: How creative ventures are fueling the UAE's cultural scene — Wednesday, February 26, 
2025. Location: Online event, 10:00 AM. On Wednesday, February 26, the Atlantic Council Win Fellowship 
will host a hybrid discussion in Abu Dhabi on how visionary entrepreneurs drive cultural evolution in the 
UAE. 
• RAND: Al Risks and Benefits in Clinical Care — Wednesday, February 26, 2025. Location: Online event, 12:00 
PM. Some areas of health care, such as medical imaging, are already benefiting from Al. But many questions 
remain on the role of Al in the broader health sector. RAND's Sean Mann will discuss different applications of 
Al in health care and summarize the evidence surrounding the effects of these applications.
