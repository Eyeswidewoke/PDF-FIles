also be applied to another gentl=man, who anyway already resides in the north: Maj. Gen. (ret.) Meir Dagan,=the 
belligerent, heavy-handed chief of the Mossad. 
The State of Israel did not claim responsibility for the assassination =f Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai. The entire matter 
is treated as AFMR According to Foreign Media Reports. We can still argue both sides of the broader issue at hand: 
assassinating senior officials in hotels (see under Rehava= Ze'evi) and in public (Imad Mughniyeh, Fathi Shkaki, Abbas 
Mussawi, A=i Hassan Salameh, and the list goes on). But we could also narrow the ques=ion to the quality of the 
performance in Dubai. And what must have seemed =o its perpetrators as a huge success is now being overshadowed by 
enormous=question marks. 
If the perpetrators were from the Mossad (AFMR, of course), Prime Minis=er Benjamin Netanyahu must be walking 
around with an acute sense of deja v=. Once again, an assassination of a senior Hamas leader in a friendly Arab=country; 
once again, an operation designed to kill someone quietly and inc=nspicuously; once again, a diplomatic mess; and once 
again, it is all happrning on Netanyahu's watch. In 1997, it was Khaled Meshal in Jordan. Th=s time, it's Mabhouh in 
Dubai.

The=anticipated diplomatic crisis is not, so far, with Dubai, but with the cou=tries whose passports were used by the 
assassins. The United Kingdom and l=eland were used once again, and this time, a French connection topped it o=f. It is 
as if Israeli governments had never apologized to London for usin= British documentation; as if they had not promised 
solemnly, when passpor=s of Her Majesty's subjects were found in a certain phone booth, that =his would never happen 
again. 
This time, they didn't mess with feisty New Zealand. But other coun=ries also do not tend to be forgiving of such insolent 
violations of their=sovereignty. Italy, for instance, has engaged for the last few years in a =erciless attack on the CIA, 
which abducted a suspected Egyptian terrorist =n Italian soil (Mordechai Vanunu's abduction came decades too early), 
=s well as on its own intelligence agencies, which assisted the American on=. As soon as the abducted man's wife filed a 
complaint, the Italian ju=iciary ruled that it could not possibly avoid investigating and pressing c=arges. In Italy, like in 
Dubai, meticulous work was invested in collecting=evidence against the suspects, mostly by going through cellular 
communicat=ons data and tracing credit card trails in hotels and other businesses. =A0 
But even if whoever carried out the assassination does reach some kind =f arrangement with the infuriated Western 
nations, it still has an obligat=on to its own citizens. 
This obligation was violated, thanks =o the Mossad AFMR - and the attorney general, whether through action or 
=naction. 
Using the identities of real, living, innocent Israelis for operational=documentation is against the law. This kind of abuse 
also causes innocent =ivilians to suffer the evil that already plagues ministers and officers: b=ing prevented from 
traveling abroad for fear of being arrested by Interpol=on suspicion of being the Dubai assassins. 
Former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy pushed for a Mossad Law to be legisla=ed that would enshrine the state's obligation 
to defend its agents cau=ht breaking laws abroad. The initiative never got off the ground: A state =an't legitimize 
illegality. But neither can it allow one of its instit=tions to arbitrarily harm civilians not the police, not the tax authority, 
not the Shin Bet security service and not the Mossad. =AO 
Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein was asked yesterday whether an=investigation will be opened following the public 
complaints of those whos= identities were stolen from them, and whose lives and liberty are therefo=e now threatened. 
Weinstein has not yet had time to study the issue. He ha= some superficial knowledge of Dagan's character, but no 
prejudice. =A0
