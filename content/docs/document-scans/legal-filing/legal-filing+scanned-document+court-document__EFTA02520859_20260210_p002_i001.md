investigation. I belie=e that our initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. Whether o= not you agree with 
this, there are two thin=s I think are important to establish. =/div> 
First=y, that the University should not propagate what can be false allegations from such a

correspondence you might send to curr=nt or former employees about this in the process of carrying out and concluding 
your investigation.

procedures (P20 — link to the procedures is =embedded in the policy document) directs the Office of Equity and Inclusion 
to conduct prompt and equitable investigations. Among the =points stated are that the Office accepts anonymous 
complai=ts as well as direct complaints. University employees are required to cooperate =with any investigation or 
allegations of violations of this policy. =Providing false or misleading information or failing to cooperate may result in 
disciplinary action. Individuals making a complaint or participating as a witness in an investigation cannot be retaliated 
against. Any employee who engages in retaliation will be disciplined.&=bsp; The Office of Equity and Inclusion does not 
make any findings until such time as it determines that it has completed its fact gathering. 
=/div> 
Our courts recognize that participants in an administrative investigation have a privilege ag=inst 
a defamation charge. In </=pan>Paros v. Hoemako Hospital, =/span>140 Ariz. 335, 681 P.2d 918 (Ct. App. Div. 2 1984), 
the court recognized that the employer's response to a notice of charge of discrimination=20 filed with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission was absolutely privileged. In Miller v= Servicemaster by Rees, 174= Ariz. at 520, 
851 P.2d 240, 243 (Ct. App. Div. 1 1993), the court recognized the existence of a conditional privilege for employees to 
report perceived acts of sexual harassment as public policy dictated that employees must be protected from workplace 
sexual harassment. Cited approvingly, Carey v. Marico=a County, 2009 WL 750225 (D= Ariz. 2009). Both Par=s and Miller 
</=pan>were cases concerning discrimination and harassment under Title VII. In =addition to its obligations under Title 
VII, the University must also operate its educational programs and activities to be free from gender discrimination under 
Title IX. 
The Office of Equity and Inclusion will proceed with its investigation as outlined in ACD 401 and 
P20. The Office will not provide yo=r client with its investigative file. We look forward to Dr. KraussQ=99s continuing 
cooperation. Regards,

Dear=Naimah et al: 
Attached you will find a letter from my attorney, along with a letter he sent to Buzzfeed earlier 
in this week regarding the defamatory and false story they were planning on printing. The story was then published 
yesterday=20 morning. <=b> I wanted to add to his letter, to reiterate our concern about how your office was planning 
to follow up on the false and defamatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because this was initiated by an onl=ne 
entertainment news outlet with a clear agenda and established record of propagating false allegations about me, rather 
than by any of the individuals they refer to as sources, this should not be considered a =credible allegation worthy of 
investigation. I believe that our initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. Whether or not y=u agree with this, 
there are two things I think a=e important to establish. 
Firstly,&nbs=;that the University should not propagate what can be false allegations from such a 
source by presenting them directly to current and/or former employees or to others. To do so would be to further their 
libelous =agenda, as Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard, I would appreciate seeing copies of the 
correspondence you might send to current or former employees about this in the process of carrying out and concluding 
your investigation. 
Secondly, I reiterate once again that the Origins Project environment is supportive, candid, 
frank, honest, and productive, with all employees being treated with respect, as well as being supported and mentored. 
I am proud of our team, and I believe they feel the same way. <=u> 
Thanks for your attention=to these letters.
