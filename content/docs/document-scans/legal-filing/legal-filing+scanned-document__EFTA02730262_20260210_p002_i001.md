UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 
All, 
As you are aware, things are constantly changing. Late yesterday evening we had a SVTC with FBI HQ and as a result, 
every field office has started the process of (1) designating job functions which are critical to our continued mission, 
and (2) identifying employees who have the ability to telework. We have started that process here in NYO. Managers 
will worry about the bureaucracy of the tasker. In speaking with your colleagues across the country you may hear 
about different offices handling designations differently, and different options being exercised about who is in and who 
is not in the office. You will hear that individuals are being designated mission critical or non-mission critical, etc. Don't 
worry about the differences or the terms — we are each in different circumstances. This office and this region are now 
working through some unique challenges (court orders, illnesses, community recommendations, state health directives, 
etc.). Other offices will have their hurdles. 
For the NYO, for now I have designated every employee as mission critical. Every employee in this office is subiect to 
immediate recall and must maintain their readiness. At this time, I am also designating all NYO job functions as 
having at least some ability to telework. That includes Special Agents. As a general goal, I do not want more than 20% 
of any squad physically present in the office at any one time. A significant threat or other required work may drive that 
percentage up/down (and your supervisor will notify you of those circumstances), but only those things that absolutely 
must be executed in the office should be. In other words, folks shouldn't be in the office solely to handle routine 
business, training, paperwork, scheduling meetings, etc. if it can wait or be handled via telework. 
In addition to our work responsibilities, we have a responsibility in mitigating community spread. We also need to 
protect the NYO's ability to surge in the event of a critical incident, and I cannot do that if-we have a large number of 
sick employees. If you are part of the 20% scheduled to physically be in the office on a given day — DO NOT REPORT IF 
YOU ARE FEELLI NG ILL. 
Supervisors: Coordinate schedules for your respective squads. 
Employees: If you don't have the ability to fill your day with telework, and many of you won't immediately, then you 
will use Admin Leave (Weather/Safety). This could change in the future, but for the immediate time frame I look at it 
this way — 2nd graders around the region are learning how to do distance learning. There are a variety of things we can 
be doing remotely. Legal training; documenting 302's utilizing OneDrive on the UNCLASS side; distance learning via 
UNCLASS virtual academy, etc. As an example - Perhaps your telework lasts two hours - then the next 6 are Admin 
(Weather/Safety). 
• I expect you to track your hours. 
• WebTA guidance will be sent out next week. 
• We all have a responsibility to keep accurate track of these hours, and I do not expect anyone to take advantage 
of this admin leave. 
• Employees must take AL as appropriate or previously planned, and continue to take SL for medical 
appointments/etc. 
• When teleworking, please utilize Office 365/FBI OneDrive and also use this time to complete relevant 
job/leadership training as appropriate. Additional guidance will be coming on how to access Virtual Academy 
courses via fbi.gov. 
Later today we expect to receive instructions on how individual employees may self-identify as being at higher risk of 
serious complications from COVI D-19. Those examples will be defined by the CDC, and you may self-identify if you 
wish managers to consider it in assigning duties. No supervisor is to proactively inquire about an employee's medical 
condition, nor is there any requirement that medical documentation will be needed. We will accept your self-
identification on your word. Separately, NY state medical guidance will continue to change. Attached is the latest 
document from NY. Understand that exposure in this region no longer means you will get a test. NJ, CT and PA 
residents may be different depending on your residence. Don't worry — you'll catch up. Understand that this too can 
change.
