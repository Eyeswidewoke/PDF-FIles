Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide 
§ 14 
(U) Even when there is reason to believe an incident was previously reported or is otherwise 
being investigated, FBI employees should generally err on the side of caution and report the 
incident to the applicable SLTT LE and/or CPS agencies without delay. Specifically, FBI 
employees are required to report any elements of suspected abuse (e.g., day, time, and place) 
they reasonably know to be distinguishable from previous reports or investigations (due to the 
possibility of multiple offenses, unreported victims, or additional perpetrators). 
14.8.4.1 
(U) CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO 
IDENTIFY THE SUBJECT OR VICTIM 
(U) FBI personnel must act with reasonable judgment based upon the totality of the 
circumstances. In instances where employees have not determined identifying information of 
a subject or victim, FBI personnel are unable to identify and report to the appropriate SLTT 
LE agency; however, when information is obtained identifying the subject or victim, 
mandatory notifications in accordance with this policy must occur. 
(U) When, in the course of official duties, an FBI employee reasonably suspects abuse of an 
identified child victim under circumstances where a subject is not fully identified, FBI 
employees must act with appropriate urgency by undertaking investigative steps to identify 
the subject and disrupt abuse against the victim or by making an appropriate external report 
to the SLIT LE agencies with investigative responsibility for the alleged abuse based on the 
location of the victim. 
(U) In circumstances where the identification of the subject and location enables an SLTT LE 
agency to disrupt ongoing or imminent abuse of a child victim, an immediate referral to the 
SLIT LE agency with investigative responsibility for the abuse must occur as soon as the 
subject and location are identified. 
14.8.4.2 
(U) IN A PENDING FBI NO-CONTACT INVESTIGATION WHERE NO INDICATION 
EXISTS THAT A CHILD IS OR WILL BE AT RISK 
(U) In cases where there is a pending FBI investigation of alleged child exploitation but the 
alleged exploitation does not involve a contact offense and logical investigative steps have 
yielded no indication the subject poses a threat of ongoing or imminent abuse to a particular 
child, external reporting to SLTT LE agencies is not required unless the circumstances 
change. 
(U) If, during the course of the FBI investigation, the FBI determines circumstances have 
changed such that external reporting to SLTT LE and/or CPS agencies may achieve further 
protection of a child victim, mandatory reporting as defined in DIOG subsections 14.8.2 and 
14.8.3 must occur and should be documented. 
(U) Throughout the investigation, FBI personnel will assess whether circumstances have 
changed, such as access to a child, and will include verification of mandatory reporting 
requirements during file reviews; additional detail related to this iterative assessment during 
an investigation can be found in the CACHTP PG. When in doubt, employees should err on 
the side of referring matters to SLTT LE agencies. 
(U) For further guidance on coordination with SLTT LE partners and logical investigative 
steps, refer to the CACHTP PG.
