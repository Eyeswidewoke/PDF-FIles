2014 V.I. LEXIS 45, *; 61 V.I. 13, ** 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
Julito Francis filed a verified Petition for Divorce on November 4, 2010. On February 3, 
2011, Dr. Wright-Francis filed an answer to Mr. Francis' petition and on March 29, 2011 
the Court referred the parties to mediation. The parties mediated but were not able to 
reach an agreement. During the mediation period, the parties filed motions concerning 
custody and wasting of marital assets. Consequently, the Court issued an Order on 
December 22, 2011, prohibiting them from "disrupting" their children and "destroying, 
removing, concealing or otherwise harming or reducing the value of the property of one or 
both of the parties.". On March 26, 2012, the Court held a final pretrial conference to set 
deadlines for trial. The Court also maintained the parties' visitation agreement.. 
8 See. Paragraph (2) (b) of this Coin's Order in r8) this matter dated December 22. 2011. 
9 At. Francis informed the Court. in his Motion to Restrain Respondent From Denying Petitioner Access to Former Marital 
Residence that the parties negotiated a visitation agreement in September of 2011, whereby both parties have custody of their 
minor daughter. Brooldyn. for fifteen (15) days of each month. Such agreement was not contested by Dr. Wright Francis. 
On July 16, 2012, Dr. Wright-Francis filed an Emergency Motion for Issuance of Show 
Cause Order, alleging that Mr. Francis violated the Court's December 22, 2011 Order by 
withdrawing Two Hundred Twenty Thousand, One Hundred Seventy Nine Dollars and 
Ninety Three Cents ($220.179.93) from his Fidelity Rollover IRA account. While the Court 
initially granted Dr. Wright-Francis' motion on July 17, 2012, that Order was later vacated 
on July 25, 2012. The Court reasoned that it was not able to make a determination since 
discovery had not been completed. ("20] Instead, the Court instructed the parties to 
retain a Certified Personal Accountant (CPA) to appraise all of their jointly owned 
properties and to recommend how the marital assets should be divided. The parties never 
complied with the order to retain r 9] an accountants. 
10 See Court's July 25. 2012 Order. 
On July 25, 2012, the Court issued a Divorce Decree to the parties and reserved 
determination on issues of custody, alimony, personal and real property for a later date. 
Meanwhile, the parties continued to live in separate sections of the marital homestead. 
During a June 17, 2013 hearing, the parties informed the Court that they were able to 
resolve the issues of custody and visitation amicably, consistent with their earlier 
agreement. On July 12, 2013 the parties were referred back to mediation. After the second 
mediation session, the mediator reported that the parties had reached a total impasse. 
However, in a status conference held on September 10, 2013, the parties advised the 
Court that they had reached an agreement and through counsel, the terms were read onto 
the record. Each party confirmed that the terms were accurate and they agreed to them. 
The Court acknowledged the terms and ordered counsel for both parties to reduce the 
agreement to writing and submit it with their client's respective signatures. Instead each 
party submitted separate draft settlements that differed slightly from the oral agreement
