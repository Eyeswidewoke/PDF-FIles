In determining whether the holders of the requisite percentage of Securities have given any direction, notice or 
consent. Securities owned by the Issuer or any Affiliate (as defined in the Indenture) thereof will be disregarded and 
deemed not to be outstanding. 
Each registered holder of a Security or Certifying Person will have the right, only after the occurrence and during 
the continuance of an Event of Default or other default under the Indenture and upon five Business Days' prior 
written notice to the Trustee, to obtain a complete list of the registered holders of the Securities (and any Certifying 
Persons): provided, however, that each owner of an interest in a Security agrees by acceptance of such list that it will 
use the list for no purpose other than the exercise of its rights under the Indenture. At any other time, a 
security holder or Certifying Person may request that the Trustee forward a notice to the other securitytolders and 
Certifying Persons on its behalf. 
Payments after an Acceleration of Maturity 
If an Event of Default has occurred but no acceleration has occurred, payments will be made on each Distribution 
Date in accordance with the Priority of Interest Proceeds and Priority of Principal Proceeds. If an Event of Default 
has occurred and has not been cured or waived and acceleration has occurred, but the Trustee has not received a 
direction to liquidate the Collateral, payments will be made on each Distribution Date in accordance with the 
Priority of Post-Acceleration Payments. Upon receipt of a direction to liquidate the Collateral, the Trustee shall 
suspend all payments pursuant to this Indenture until the date or dates designated by the Trustee for distribution (the 
"Liquidation Distribution Date"). The application of any money thereafter collected by the Trustee (net of any sale 
expenses) pursuant to this the Indenture and any funds that may then be held or thereafter received by the Trustee 
shall be applied on each Liquidation Distribution Date, in accordance with the Priority of Post-Acceleration 
Payments.

(iv) 
providing for a successor Trustee;

Amount of the Class A-1 Notes have provided written notice of its objection to the Trustee within 15 
Business Days of notice of such proposed amendment setting out reasonable basis for such holders' 
determination that such amendment would have a material and adverse effect on the interests of the Class 
A-1 Notes. such amendment must be proposed pursuant to clause (1): provided however, that if additional 
Class A-I Notes have been issued after the Closing Date, the threshold for objection will be the percentage 
determined by multiplying 25% by the ratio (expressed as a percentage) obtained by dividing (A) the
