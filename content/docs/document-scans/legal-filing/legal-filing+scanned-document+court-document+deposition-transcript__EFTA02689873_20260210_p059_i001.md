Repatriation restrictions 
14.12 
The right of foreign investors to transfer abroad income received from investments such as profits, dividends and 
interest payments from the emerging markets in which the Compartment intends to invest may be restricted in 
some emerging countries [to be confirmed). In addition, where the right of repatriation of capital is recognised, 
it may be subject to settlement of all applicable taxes and duties. and it may not be excluded that changes in the 
relevant laws involve that amounts representing realisation of capital or income will become subject to currency 
control and that the repatriation of income from Portfolio Companies will be restricted. 
Taxation 
14.13 
Emerging countries' tax laws and practices are not always as clearly established as that of the European Union. 
Differing interpretations of tax regulations may exist both among and within government ministries and 
organizations at the federal, regional and local levels, creating uncertainties and inconsistent enforcement. 
Furthermore. in the absence of binding precedent or consistent court practice, rulings on tax or other related 
matters by different courts relating to the same and similar circumstances may also be inconsistent or 
contradictory. 
Taxpayers often have to resort to court proceedings to defend their position against the tax authorities. Certain 
events suggest that the tax authorities may be taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the 
legislation and assessments. 
The abovementioned conditions create tax risks in emerging markets that are more significant than typically 
found in countries with more developed tax systems, imposing additional burdens and costs on operations, 
including management resources. There can be no assurance that current taxes will not be increased, that 
additional tax charges will not be imposed on us or that additional sources of revenue or income, or other 
activities, will not be subject to new taxes, charges or similar fees in the future. In addition to substantial tax 
burden, these risks and uncertainties complicate tax planning and related business decisions, potentially 
exposing to significant fines and penalties and enforcement measures despite the best efforts at compliance. [To 
be confirmed.) 
Legal system in emerging countries 
14.14 
The volume of new legislation which has appeared in some emerging countrics, as well as the magnitude of the 
changes taking place, has resulted in a lack of confidence in the courts to give clear and consistent judgements. 
Legal acts are published by a variety of state bodies and complete compliance with legal rules and standards, 
including in relation to privatisation. has often been difficult to achieve even for those attempting to do so. There 
is also a lack of precedent in relation to market-oriented legal relations. Due to the inconsistency of some of the 
legislation, the same provisions of the law may be applied differently by different local authorities and state 
bodies. The uncertainty as to how the law will be applied by different local authorities and state bodies may have 
adverse consequences for the Compartment. Judges and courts are generally inexperienced in the area of 
business and corporate law. Judicial precedents have no binding effect on subsequent decisions in emerging 
countries being civil law jurisdictions. In addition, most court decisions arc not readily available to the public. 
Enforcement of court judgements can in practice be very difficult in many emerging countries. All of these 
factors make judicial decisions in emerging countries difficult to predict and effective redress uncertain. 
Additionally, court judgements are not always enforced or followed by law enforcement agencies. 
Governmental authorities' powers 
14.15 
Government authorities have a high degree of discretion in many emerging countries and at times exercise their 
discretion arbitrarily, without hearing or prior notice, and sometimes in a manner that is contrary to law. 
Moreover, governments may also have the power under certain circumstances, by regulation or a government act, 
to interfere with the performance of, nullify or terminate contracts. Governmental actions have included
