To reflect the acquisition of PlentyOfFish by Match Group. On October 28, 2015, we completed the acquisition of PlentyOfFish, which is being reflected 
in the unaudited pm forma combined balance sheet as if it had occurred on September 30. 2015. The $575.0 million purchase price was funded 
through a combination of $75.0 million of cash on hand and a $500.0 million cash contribution from IAC; $155.0 million of which was contributed prior 
to September 30, 2015 and is reflected in the Match Group combined balance sheet as of September 39 2015. IAC will ultimately receive Match Group 
shares for the $500.0 million contribution. The number of shares that will be issued will be calculated using the Initial public offering price. Match Group 
is in the process of preparing a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
