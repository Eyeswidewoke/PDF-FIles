Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating 
to this offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to 
amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders' rights or 
pre-business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem 
their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholder, officers, directors and director 
nominees have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their 
redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our 
initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, 
among other things, that: 
prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (I) seek stockholder 
approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders 
may seek to redeem their shares. regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business 
combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, 
including interest (which interest shall be net of taxis payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with 
the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a 
stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the 
trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) in each ease subject to the 
limitations described herein; 
• we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least 
$5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the 
outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
• if our initial business combination is not consummated within 24 months from the closing of this offering. 
then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and 
• prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would 
entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business 
combination. 
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the 
event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and 
restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we may consummate our initial business combination only if 
approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders 
meeting.
