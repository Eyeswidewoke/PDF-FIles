He's asked for more hours—or more consistent hours, at least—but his employer, whose name he asked 
me not to use, doesn't want to give any worker more than 35 hours because then they'll be classified as 
full-time, he said. 
"A minimum-wage job is a bit of a hellhole in terms of employee treatment and not making a living 
wage," said Kulsic, 19. "I come from a low-income family, and I thought I could pull myself up by my 
bootstraps. I used to believe in class mobility, but it's a myth." 
When he moved to Vermont for school, Kulsic landed in one of the most progressive states in the 
country in terms of employee wage-and-hour laws. Vermont's current minimum wage, at $8.73 an hour, 
is one of the highest in the country, nearly $1.50 above the federal minimum wage. It will rise to $9.60 in 
2016, $10 in 2017, and $10.50 in 2018. The state approved these increases this summer, well before 
voters in states across the country, including Arkansas and South Dakota, passed minimum-wage 
increases at the ballot box. 
Vermont was also the first state in the country to pass a "Right to Request" law, which allows any worker 
to ask for scheduling changes for any reason without fear of employer retaliation. The law requires an 
employer to consider such requests at least twice a year. In 2013, Vermont strengthened a law that 
requires men and women be paid equally for equal work. The state also allows workers to disclose their 
own wages and inquire about others' wages without their employers' permission. 
Though these laws surely helped some Vermonters, interviews with Kulsic and other low-wage workers 
in the state indicate that minimum-wage-and-scheduling laws barely begin to solve the problems that 
poverty creates in states across the country. That's because the nature of low-wage work has changed 
dramatically in the last decade, as companies shift to more part-time workers who have little control 
over their schedules, and because the cost of living has been growing much faster than wages have. 
Kulsic would love more control over his schedule, so he can take a few classes or get a second job. But 
he'd never heard of the "Right to Request" law, and says people at his workplace get let go if they ask for 
anything at work—whether it be more hours or day shifts. 
His bosses "have been known to ignore time-off requests, and usually folks are too afraid of severance 
to request anything," Kulsic said. 
"If we raise wages but don't stabilize people's schedules, what does it do for them?" 
A study released this summer by researchers at the University of Chicago indicates that the problems 
that Kulsic faces are widespread. Looking at the schedules of adults 26 to 32 in the labor market, it found 
that 75 percent of workers in hourly jobs reported fluctuations in the number of hours they worked per 
week, sometimes by more than eight hours. In the food service industry, 90 percent of workers said 
their hours fluctuated, on average, by 68 percent. Only one-third of hourly workers were allowed any 
input into their work schedule, according to the report. 
"There's been a real shift in what proportion of workers are full-time versus part time," said Susan 
lambert, a University of Chicago professor and one of the authors of the study. "Some workers get full 
or stable hours, but everyone else is fighting for more hours, scrambling for more hours." 
It's the nature of the post-recession economy: Fewer workers are getting as many hours as they need. 
Last month, there were 7 million Americans working part-time for economic reasons—either because
