Currently, there are proton-therapy centers in a number of industrialized countries includin= Japan, the United Kingdom 
and the United States, but only a few of those ar= located in a hospital. The others are all specialized treatment centers 
that only d= proton therapy, and they have to pick and choose among prospective patients based on need. In general, 
children are top candidates, because X-ray radia=ion treatment can be so damaging to a body that's still growing; and 
childr=n and adults with inoperable tumors in the brain or on the spinal cord are good candidates. More and more 
proton-therapy centers are springing up, though -= the United States and elsewhere. 
Pencil beam scanning a=lows a more precise dose of radiation by "painting" the tumor with protons, which limits 
radiation to surrounding healthy organs. Pencil =eam scanning uses a beam that is much smaller than that used for 
traditional pr=ton treatments. The experience at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, which pioneered pencil beam 
scanning, ha= shown that pencil beam scanning is an advance over traditional radiotherapy=(which uses photons) 
because its beam is targeted only to the tumor. It can therefore be used at higher therapeutic doses and with fewer side 
effects to surrounding healthy tissue..=A0 As of August 2013, 43 particle therapy facilities worldwide represented a 
total of 121 treatment rooms available to patients. Of these, 28% are located in the US, 23% are located in Japan, and 
more than 96,537 patients had been treated. A conservative estimate is that about 137,000 new cancer patients each 
year in the United States could bene=it from proton therapy. Current capacity is 11,270 patients a year. 
One hindrance to universal use of the proton in cance= treatment is the size and cost of the cyclotron or synchrotron 
equipment necessary. Several industrial teams are working on development of comparatively small accelerator systems 
to delive= the proton therapy to patients. Among the technologies being investigated are superconducting 
synchrocyclotrons (=lso known as FM Cyclotrons), ultra-compact synchrotrons, dielectric wall accelerators, and linear 
particle accelerators. Advances in medical imaging technology that will improve the delivery of proton beam therapy in 
the treatment of cancer was announced this week at a major medical conference in the UK could make proton beam 
therapy even more=of a viable treatment for many more cancer sufferers than ever. 
Builders race to develop sky-high condo buildings 
New York builders are de=eloping condo towers as tall as the Empire State Building -- and one that will be j=st one foot 
shy of the new One World Trade Center. 
Completed t=is year, New York City's One57 reaches 1,005 feet, making it New York's tallest residential building. 
</=pan>But it will soon be unseated. Within the next two yea=s, both 432 Park Avenue and 111 West 57th St. are 
expected to soar past One57. <=span>Then comes the 2018 opening of 225 West 57th St., also known as the Nordstrom 
Tower. Slated to reach 1,775 feet (includi=g its spire), it will be just one foot shy of the new One World Trade 
Center.=/span> "It's happening all over. I describe this as luxury real estate becoming the new global currency," said 
rea= estate appraiser Jonathan Miller of Miller Samuel.
