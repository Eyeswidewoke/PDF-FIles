Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
1. Basis of Presentation 
The historical financial information of AB Acquisition and Safeway was derived from financial statements of the respective 
companies included elsewhere in this prospectus. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to 
events that are (i) directly attributable to the Safeway acquisition, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) with respect to the unaudited pro 
forma condensed consolidated statement of continuing operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results. 
Condensed consolidated statements of continuing operations data for the 16 weeks ended June 12, 2014 and June 20, 2015 and 
summary balance sheet data as of June 20, 2015 are derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the 
periods then ended also included elsewhere in this prospectus. Safeway is included in the historical operating results of AB Acquisition 
for the period from January 31, 2015 through June 20, 2015. The adjusted historical financial information for Safeway for the 49 weeks 
ended January 30. 2015 is derived by adding the financial data from Safeway's audited consolidated statement of income for the 53 
weeks ended January 3, 2015 and Safeway's unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the four weeks ended 
January 30, 2015, and subtracting Safeway's unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the eight weeks ended 
February 22. 2014. The adjusted historical Safeway financial information for the 16 weeks ended June 12, 2014 was derived from the 
Safeway pre-acquisition unaudited financial statements for the 24 weeks ended June 14, 2014 and subtracting Safeway's unaudited 
condensed consolidated statement of income for the eight weeks ended February 22, 2014. 
2. Pro Forma for Safeway Acquisition 
The Safeway acquisition was accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805. Business Combinations, 
with AB Acquisition considered the acquirer of Safeway for accounting purposes. The Safeway acquisition closed on January 30, 2015, 
and, therefore, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are already included in AB Acquisition's historical condensed 
consolidated balance sheet as of June 20. 2015. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of continuing operations 
reflects the adjustments as if the Safeway acquisition occurred on February 21, 2014, the first day of fiscal 2014 (collectively referred to 
as "Pro Forma Adjustments for Safeway acquisition"). 
The Pro Forma Adjustments for Safeway acquisition consist of the following: 
(a) 
FTC divestiture 
In connection with the Safeway acquisition. Albertson's Holdings, together with Safeway, announced that they entered into 
agreements to sell 111 Albertsons and 57 Safeway stores across eight states to four separate buyers. Divestiture of these stores was 
required by the FTC as a condition of closing the Safeway acquisition and was contingent on the completion of the Safeway acquisition. 
The divestitures were completed by the end of the company's fiscal 2015 first quarter ended June 20, 2015. The pro forma adjustments 
reflect: 
Fiscal 2014: 
(i) 
a reduction in Net sales and other revenue of $3,285.3 million and the related reductions in Cost of sales of $2,283.3 
million; and 
(ii) 
a decrease in Selling and administrative expenses of $1.068.3 million, which includes the $233.4 million impairment 
loss related to the divested stores.
