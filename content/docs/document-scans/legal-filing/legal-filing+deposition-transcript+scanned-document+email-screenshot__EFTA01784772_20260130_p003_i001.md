We see the US job strong gains over the past two months as a payback from the very weak jobs report in Ma= (24,000) 
and sluggish reading in April (144,000). We think the Fed will w=it until December given that there are still global 
uncertainties on the h=rizon, as well as the US election at home 
chttp:/=rsch.baml.com/r?q=xmFl7nFtIDGsULCIZFM7VA&e=amanda.ens%40baml.com&a=p;h=DIvqlw> . Information 
service= and leisure & hospitality sectors saw the biggest acceleration in ave=age job growth in July and June versus May 
and April, of roughly 40,000 each. We have been particularly encouraged by the increase in the l=bor force participation 
rate (LFPR) which has shown an influx of new entra=ts into the labor force. The LFPR has increased for seven of the last 
ten =onths, showing a notable move higher since October. This means that there have been cyclical gains sufficient t= 
offset the persistent downward pull from the aging population. This means=that there is greater capacity in the labor 
market and perhaps a longer ru=way for this business cycle.

<http:Arsch.baml.com/r?q=kVSIqhpENE!XmBPbWCavcA&e=amanda.ens%40baml.com&a=p;h=nFO6cA> . The more
