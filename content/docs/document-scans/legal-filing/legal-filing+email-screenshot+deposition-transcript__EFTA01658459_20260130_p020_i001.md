Gun Seizures Are Up At US Airports. 
The Dallas Morning News (8/10, Grigsby, 946K) reports, "With air traffic nearing a five-month 
high, airport security is finding guns in passenger carry-on bags at three times the rate 
recorded before the pandemic. And 80% of the guns are loaded." According to the Morning 
News, "The discoveries at airports comes at a time when U.S. gun sales are surging, and 
analysts believe many of those purchases are being made by first-time buyers. DFW 
International Airport tied for second nationally with 13 gun seizures last month, while Dallas 
Love Field ranked fifth with Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport at nine seizures 
each. Officers found 15.3 guns for every million people screened in July, compared with 5.1 per 
million people in July of last year, the Transportation Security Administration said Monday. There 
has been a significant increase in loaded guns at checkpoints, said TSA Administrator David 
Pekoske." 
The Los Angeles Times (8/10, Martin, 4.64M) reports, "The total number of firearms 
uncovered by the TSA dropped to 304 last month from 401 in July 2019, according to the 
agency. During the same period, the pandemic has reduced the number of passengers being 
screened by TSA officers by nearly three-quarters, to 20.7 million last month from 79.5 million 
passengers in July 2019. 'Travelers must understand that firearms are prohibited items at 
airports and in the passenger cabins of aircraft,' Pekoske said. 'As hard as we are working to 
mitigate other risks at this time, no one should be introducing new ones:"

White-Collar Prosecutions In Decline During Trump Administration. 
Bloomberg (8/10, Hurtado, Dolmetsch, Roth, Voreacos, 4.73M) reports, "Donald Trump calls 
himself the 'law and order' president, but when it comes to white collar crime, he has overseen 
a significant decline in enforcement." Bloomberg adds, "The prosecution of securities fraud, 
antitrust violations and other such crimes has hit a record low as the pandemic slows the 
courts, according to one tracking service. But even before the coronavirus, the numbers were 
falling under the Trump administration. The average annual number of white collar defendants 
was down 26% to 30% for Trump's first three years in office from the average under President 
Barack Obama, according to data from the Justice Department and Syracuse University, 
respectively. The trend also shows up in fines on corporations, which fell 76% from Obama's 
last 20 months to Trump's first 20 months, according to Duke University law professor Brandon 
Garrett."
