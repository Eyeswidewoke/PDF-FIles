Finance Charges: Avenge Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges:We use the Average Daily 
Balance method to calculate Finance Charges on your Acoount. Underth's method, we figure the Finance Charges on your 
Account by applying the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as describedbelow) for each feature (such as 
Purchase, Cash Advance and Balance Transfer features)) of your Account (inducing current transactions). To get the 
Average Daily Balance for each feature, we (1)) take the beginning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid 
Finance Chargs from previous billing periods), (2) add any new transactions, debts, or fees,.(3)subtrad any payments or 
credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustmen s. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also 
add an amount of interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the darnperiodic rote 
for the feature. This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for 
the next day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the 
feature for the tilling period and divide the total by the number of days in the tang period. This gives us the Average 
Daily Balance for the feature. For all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance 
wil be considered to be zero if you paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the 
Payment Due Date shown on that statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number 
of days in the billing period and the daily periodic rate for that feature, the result wit be the Finance Charge 
Assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge for the billing period 
is calculated by adding the Finance Charges assessed on all features of the Account. This method of calculating the 
Average Daly Balance and Finance chance results In daily compounding of Finance Charges. Theminimum 
Finance Charge for any billing period in which -Finance Charges are imposed is $0.50. 
Transactions Made In Foreign Currencies: If you Incur a Charge in a foreign currency, it will be 
converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or cur agents. Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law 
we will choose a conversion rate that IS acceptable to us for that date. 
Currently, the conversion rale we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest 
official conversion rate published by a government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate 
identified by us from customary banking sources, on the conversion date or the prior business day, 
in each Instance 
increased 
by 
2%. . This conversion rate may differ from rates in effect on the 
date of your Charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such 
establishments use.
