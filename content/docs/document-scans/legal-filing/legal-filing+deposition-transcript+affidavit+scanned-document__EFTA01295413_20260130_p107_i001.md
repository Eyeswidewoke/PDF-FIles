(REGULAR CALENDAR) 
APPEAL From the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. 
PETREE, J. 
[' P1] Plaintiff-appellant, Hanlin-Rainaldi Construction Corporation ("Hanlin-Rainaldi"), 
appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas that granted 
partial summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee, Jeepersl, Inc. ("Jeepers"). For 
the following reasons, we affirm. 
[' P2] Jeepers owns and operates indoor animated theme parks that are designed to 
serve families with children who are 12 years old or younger. Within these indoor animated 
theme parks are amusement park rides, soft play areas, skill games, and family dining. 
[' P3] In August 1999, Jeepers and Concord Mills Limited Partnership ("Concord Mills") 
entered into a ten-year lease agreement with the intention that Jeepers would operate a 
business establishment at a leasehold in Concord Mills Mall in Concord, North Carolina. 
[*1'2] Under this agreement, after Jeepers satisfied conditions precedent, Concord Mills 
apparently agreed to pay Jeepers an allowance for construction improvements. 
[' P4] In August 1999, Jeepers also entered into an agreement with Hanlin-Rainaldi, an 
Ohio corporation that Jeepers apparently had retained on several previous occasions for 
other construction projects. According to this agreement, Jeepers agreed to pay $ 
1,100,000 to Hanlin-Rainaldi for upfitting the leasehold at Concord Mills Mall. 
r P5] Effective August 1999, Jeepers also contracted with Win & Associates, Inc. Min & 
Associates"), a general contractor in North Carolina. According to this agreement, Jeepers 
appointed Win & Associates to be the general contractor for the Concord Mills Mall project 
and directed them to use Hanlin-Rainaldi as the major prime contractor for the Concord 
Mills Mall project. The project agreement between Jeepers and Win & Associates also 
required, among other things, that Jeepers: (1) assign its agreement with Hanlin-Rainaldi 
to Win & Associates for the purpose of satisfying North Carolina licensing and permit 
requirements; (2) pay the contract sum as provided in its agreement with Hanlin-Rainaldi 
["3] directly to Hanlin-Rainaldi; and (3) pay a management fee to Win & Associates. 
[' P6] Jeepers, however, failed to pay Hanlin-Rainaldi for services rendered, thereby 
breaching its agreement with Hanlin-Rainaldi. To perfect its interest, Hainlin-Rainaldi filed 
a lien in North Carolina against the leasehold. 
[' P7] In May 2000, desiring to settle any and all claims resulting from the construction 
project that the parties had against each other, Jeepers and Hanlin-Rainaldi entered into a 
settlement agreement, wherein Jeepers acknowledged it owed $ 708,084 to Hanlin-
Rainaldi. Pursuant to this agreement, Jeepers promised to pay $ 440,000 upon execution 
of the agreement, with the remaining balance to be paid by: (1) a promissory note in the 
amount of $ 160,000 ("Note 1"); and (2) a cognovit note in the amount of $ 108,084. In 
exchange, Hanlin-Rainaldi agreed to release the lien against the leasehold at Concord 
Mills Mall.
I Jeepers has correctly observed that the copy of the May 2000 agreement in the record was not signed or dated by Hanlin-
Rainaldi and lacked some exhibits that were referenced in the settlement agreement. (Jeepers' Reply Memorandum in Support
