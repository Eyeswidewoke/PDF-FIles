Turning to the substance of your allegations, first you should be aware that I 
take the issue of sexual harassment very seriously. This is confirmed by the fact that after I was hired by CFI as its in-
house lawyer (a position I held prior to becoming president and CEO) I insisted that the organization adopt a 
comprehensive zero-tolerance harassment policy covering workplace harassment. Moreover, during the time I was 
president and CEO we had three separate state trainings for the entire staff on sexual harassment issues. In addition, 
where necessary, we did not hesitate to expend significant resources, including retaining outside investigators, to 
conduct serious, detailed inquiries into harassment claims. One such inquiry cost the organization over $40,000. 
Therefore, any suggestion that I do not personally take harassment claims seriously is amply disconfirmed by my record. 
Regarding the =lleged incident on the 2011 cruise, the first I became aware of it 
was when Pat Beauchamp, =FI's business manager and the employee responsible for cruise logistics, wrote to me in 
2013 indicating she objected to inviting Lawrence Krauss on our upcoming Galapagos cruise. I found this strange, and I 
responded to her almost immediately asking the reasons for her objection. She gave two reasons. The first was that 
Krauss did not pay sufficient attention to the guests on the 2011 cruise. I had heard this concern from one guest myself; 
on the other hand, I also heard from several guests that they thought Krauss's presentations =ere excellent and a 
highlight of the cruise. Accordingly, I did not give this concern much weight. 
The second =eason was that Krauss had allegedly asked a female guest on the 
cruise to join him and his partner, apparently for some sort of sexual activity (I cannot recall whether Krauss was 
engaged or married or just seriously involved with his female companion at the time, although they were clearly 
romantically involved and seemed very much in love). This is the first I had heard of this proposition. No complaint by 
the guest or anyone else had been made to me at the time of the cruise, although I was on the cruise and clearly visible 
throughout the =ruise. 
I asked Ms. Beauchamp for =ontact information for this guest. I did call the 
guest and she substantially confirmed what Ms. Beauchamp had said. I apologized on behalf of the organization. The 
guest indicated although she was taken aback by Krauss's =roposition at the time, she did not want to pursue the matter 
further. I then got in contact with Krauss. Krauss denied the allegation. In light of the guest's reluctance to pursue the 
matter and Krauss's own denial and, importantly, =ecause between the time of the 2011 cruise and the Galapagos cruise 
we had instituted a policy regarding harassment at any CFI event, which covers not just employees, but speakers and 
attendees, I decided to go ahead with my plan and have Krauss as a speaker on the Galapagos cruise. Krauss was fully 
aware of our harassment policy regarding CFI events because we had had a discussion about it. Therefore, I expected 
him to comply with that policy on the Galapagos cruise. As far as I know he did, because we received no complaints 
about his conduct. Nor have we received any complaints about his conduct at other events. 
Let me just take a moment to highlight the 2012 policy, which you can find in 
full here, 
http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/cfis_new_policy_on_hostile_conduct_harassment_at_conferences/ 
along with the announcement I made explaining the rationale for the policy. This policy was, certainly at its time, 
arguably the strongest any nonprofit organization had regarding conduct at its events. Again, this policy shows that any 
suggestion that CFI, as an organization, or that I personally took a lax attitude regarding harassment is completely 
without factual =oundation. 
In your email you mentioned =hat one staffer resigned after I invited Krauss on 
the Galapagos cruise. l'= not aware of any staffer resigning because of that. If you give me a name I could comment on 
the reasons for the staffer leaving. Ms. Beauchamp remained an employee of CFI (and went on the Galapagos cruise 
with Krauss). 
You mentioned also the comments that were made to me in March 2012 by 
Melody Hensley. Let me give you the background for that. CFI was holding an event prior to the 2012 Reason Rally in DC. 
Richard Dawkins, Jessica Alquist, Jamie Raskin, and Lawrence Krauss were scheduled to speak at the event. Melody 
Hensley was heavily involved in the planning for the event and in fact was tapped to make introductions for the
