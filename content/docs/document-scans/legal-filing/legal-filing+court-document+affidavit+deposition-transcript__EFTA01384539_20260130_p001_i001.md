• 
Relative Value Long/Short Equity — involves taking a number of long and short 
positions in a particular equity market to create a portfolio that is designed to have 
a reduced, if any, net market exposure. Equities that are deemed relatively 
undervalued are purchased long and relatively overvalued equities are sold short. 
This strategy can benefit from relative value discrepancies with reduced stock 
market risk and may be driven by fundamental analysis of industry sectors. 
• 
Fundamental Long/Short Equity — involves taking long positions in undervalued 
equity securities and short positions in overvalued equity securities. In this 
strategy, the Multi-Strat Funds often accept some equity market exposure seeking

Leverage at the Levered Fund Level 
In pursuing its investment objective (i.e., its investment in the Master Fund through the 
Intermediate Fund), the Levered Fund expects to employ a substantial degree of leverage 
at the Levered Fund level ("Fund Leverage"), which is in addition to the leverage 
obtained at the Master Fund level. Although the Levered Fund has no pre-determined 
limitations on the amount of leverage it may utilize, the Levered Fund's target leverage is 
l.5x-2x net asset value ("NAV'). The Levered Fund may use more or less leverage 
without notice to the shareholders. Leverage is also used by the Master Fund. While 
leverage presents the opportunity for increasing the total return on investments, it has the 
effect of potentially increasing losses as well. 
The Levered Fund will obtain the Fund Leverage from a third party multi-national 
financial institution (such institution, or any additional or substitute lender, the "Lender). 
Under the terms of this financing, the Levered Fund intends to secure Fund Leverage by 
pledging all of its assets, including its interests in the Intermediate Fund, to the 
Lender. Further, the Intermediate Fund will guarantee the Levered Fund's obligations to 
the Lender and pledge all of its assets, including its interests in the Master Fund (which 
guarantee will be limited to the NAV of the Fund's interests in the Intermediate Fund) to 
the Lender. The Fund Leverage will take the form of a note issued by the Levered Fund 
to the Lender and/or other similar instruments or structures designed to achieve a similar 
result. The cost of the Fund Leverage will be structured as a floating benchmark which 
will be reset periodically plus a fixed additional amount which may be reset annually. 
The principal amount will be payable at the end of the one year term unless the Lender 
determines not to extend the Fund Leverage. The Fund Leverage will be provided under 
agreements ("Lender Agreements") that will require the Levered Fund to make 
customary representations as well as provide the Lender with additional rights including 
but not limited to indemnity rights and rights to have any increased costs or other 
expenses reimbursed. The Lender Agreements will also subject the Fund to additional 
obligations and requirements such as reporting, borrower covenants, and representations, 
investments guidelines and portfolio diversification. The Lender Agreements will also
