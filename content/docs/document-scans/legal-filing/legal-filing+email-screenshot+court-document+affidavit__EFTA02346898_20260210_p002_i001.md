The NOHO C Install verision is a we=therproof 2-way full-range 430 watt loudspeaker with a Mil-Spec polymer 
cab=net, WeatherTech"' grill system, 8 x 1/4-20 T-nut flypoints, 4 x 5/1= T-nuts for bracket mounting, 2 x 3/8-16 
threaded inserts for Yoke mounting= 2 x Neutrik 4MP connectors, 1 x 12"coaxial driver. 
The smallest of the high-powered AS Series of l=udspeakers, the Noho C is designed for use in abusive, real-
world situation=, both on the road or in permanent installations. Combining superrugged, U.=. Armed Forces road case 
technology with a number of acoustic innovations, t=e Noho C is a compact and durable loudspeaker that is very 
powerful and mus=cally accurate. 
The Noho C is the perfect unit for any applica=ion where compact size and high power are required. 
Technomad's unique cabi=et tuning delivers exceptional bass extension and articulation from a small=loudspeaker 
cabinet. The Noho C is extremely EQ compliant and offers the us=r unrivaled control over every type of program 
material. The cast frame coa=ial driver used in the Noho C insures point source clarity, high power hand=ing and long 
life. Only the highest-quality metalized polypropylene capacit=rs and heavy gauge inductors are used in Technomad 
networks, minimizing ins=rtion loss and resulting in smooth response throughout the operating bandwi=th. 
The Noho C is designed for maximum flexibility=and ease of use. 1.5" diameter stand-mount sockets are molded 
into the cabi=et on all four sides for tripod mounting in either vertical or horizontal o=ientation. Four 1/4-20 threaded 
inserts on the top and right sides of the c=binet allow the Noho to be flown easily with eyebolts. On the Tour Model 
ve=sion, the included lid protects the speaker during transport. A large handl= on each end makes carrying the Noho C 
extremely easy. All Tour Model AS Se=ies Technomads stack together via interlocking ribs during transit, and lik=-size 
Tour Model cabinets lock together. The Noho C can be used as a monito= by inserting two 7" lengths of stand-mount 
tubing into two 1.5" sockets on=the back of the cabinet. The Noho C can be bracket-mounted with Omnimount 1=0 
Series or Allen Products MM-022 brackets using the four 5/16-18 inserts o= the back of the cabinet. All hardware, 
including the grill is black, stain=ess steel to prevent corrosion and is recessed to prevent damage during shi=ment. From 
the inside out, every part of every Technomad loudspeaker is d=signed to provide optimum performance in even the 
worst conditions. 
The PassiveProcessorm option further e=pands the Noho's flexibility and ease of use in mobile applications= The 
PassiveProcessorm is an internal four position EQ circuit whic= shifts the optimum listening distance farther away from 
the loudspeaker by=increasing the high frequency output of the unit. This allows a PassiveProc=ssor equipped Noho to 
be used in both nearfield and longer-throw applicatio=s without requiring any external processing. 
Noho C loudspeakers are used worldwide in appl=cations ranging from concert sound systems to theaters to 
military PA to cr=ise ships to ballparks.
