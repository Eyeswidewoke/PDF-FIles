FX Blueprint: Forever Young 
Theme #13: Can SARdines - Stay away from SAR peg trade 
▪ 
Saudi Arabia still has time to defend the dollar peg 
but they must act more decisively on fiscal matters. 
Wait for better levels before buying 12m USDSAR.

Reserves are nearly equal to GDP and twice the M1

money supply. Debt was far higher and reserves 
far lower during successful defenses in 1998-2003.

Both falling oil prices and a rising dollar suppress

Saudi inflation but outright deflation is unlikely

Monetary policy credibility far outweighs any 
minimal economic gains from releasing the peg

Other Gulf currencies (Oman), are more vulnerable

Still time to spare in Saudi Arabia 
In recent days those sleepy Gulf dollar pegs have 
suddenly awoken. The dollar's relentless rise has made 
the Saudi Arabian riyal expensive too and SAR 12m 
forward points have jumped to record levels (Figure 1). 
It turns out those large FX reserve buffers were handy 
after all. EM exchange rate policy is being challenged 
in Asia and the Middle East, with the likes of China and 
Saudi Arabia seeing reserves depleted at rates above 
1% per month. Fortunately for the USDSAR peg, Saudi 
reserves still total $635 billion, or approximately 95% of 
GOP. Record outflows may continue for several years, 
fueled not just by the trade deficit but also by capital 
outflows, and we project them to be $510bn by end-17. 
Even still they will be far larger as a share of the 
economy than China (30%) and equal to Switzerland. 
The IMF estimates a 5-year fiscal buffer even at the 
2015 $100 oil budget breakeven price (Figure 2). The 
reverse repo rate is only 50bp and the economy is not 
very sensitive to rate increases given low diversification. 
Moreover the Saudis have several as-yet untapped 
sources of dollar financing. One is to simply issue USD 
debt as in the 1990s - private external debt totals 
$68bn, a mere I0% of GDP (by contrast, South African 
and Turkish total external debt equals 46% and 58% of 
GOP, respectively). An IPO of Saudi Aramco refining 
assets, 
as suggested by Deputy Crown Prince 
Mohammad bin Selman, can also raise dollar financing. 
Of course the Saudis must also want to keep the peg if 
it is to hold -- lest we forget lessons learned from the 
SNB. The Swiss could have increased sight deposits 
ad infinitum but they lost the will to do so and felt the 
CHF TWI had depreciated enough (dragged down by 
the euro peg). 
DXY strength has a noticeable 
dampening effect on Saudi inflation independent of 
Brent prices - 10% DXY lower SA CPI by 1% on 
average (Figure 3). While it is conceivable the 
government will tire of SAR TWI strength as well, the 
authorities have recently issued strongly worded 
statements in defense of the peg.
