FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
with our own view. That said, the Australian rates 
market has a tendency to sell off considerably once it 
becomes clear than an easing cycle in Australia is over. 
(Figure 4). As to what might spark such a sell-off; an 
improvement in the labor market stands as one clear 
possibility. RBA action - and market pricing for the 
RBA - is often driven by conditions in the labor market. 
As Figure 5 shows, our tracking of 11 different monthly 
indicators of labor demand and sentiment suggests a 
pick-up in the pace of employment growth over 
coming months. All up, we therefore see the risks 
being skewed toward a narrowing of the front end 
interest rate differential between Australian and New 
Zealand, something that would be supportive of our 
long AUD/NZD stance. 
Finally, it would be remiss of us not to consider the 
outlook for China when discussing any view on AUD, 
either against the USD or crosses. Our house view 
remains quite constructive on China, with GDP growth 
expected by DB to continue its recovery towards 8.6% 
in 2014. Despite the modest decline in the December 
PMI reading, our local economists note that the PMI's 
Q4 average reached 51.3, 0.5pts above the Q3 average 
which suggests that Q4 IP and GDP growth are unlikely 
to have decelerated from that seen in O3. Looking 
forward, stronger external demand should see an 
acceleration of GDP growth over 2014. If this view on 
China is correct, then it should be supportive of the 
AUD given the tendency of the market to see the 
Aussie as a China proxy (see Figure 6). 
We are; however, a little cautious about overplaying 
any impact that stronger growth in China may have on 
the AUD, given that Australia's key commodity export 
to China (iron ore) is likely to be moving into an 
oversupply situation this year. We should note here 
that while many analysts focus heavily on relative 
commodity prices when considering the AUD/NZD 
cross; we are inclined to think that the true importance 
of commodity prices is captured through the influence 
on interest rate differentials. In other words, we take 
the view that the impact of divergent commodity price 
trends is likely to have already been captured by 
interest rate differentials. 
All up, some recovery following the sharp fall in 2013. 
the favorable valuation backdrop, and the risk that the 
interest rate differential moves in the AUD's favor over 
coming months has us long AUD/NZD.
