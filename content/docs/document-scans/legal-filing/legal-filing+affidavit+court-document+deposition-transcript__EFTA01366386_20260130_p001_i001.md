Warrants 
Public Stockholders' Warrants 
Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one-half of one sham of our common stock at a price 
of $5.75 per half share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 
months from the closing of this offering or 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. For 
example, if a warrant holder holds two warrants, such warrants will be exercisable for one sham of the company's 
common stock. Warrants must be exercised for a whole share. The warrants will expire five years after the 
completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or 
liquidation. 
We will not be obligated to deliver any shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will 
have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with 
repot to the shares of common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is 
current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be 
exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shams to holders seeking to 
exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the 
securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, unless an exemption is available. In the event that the 
conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of 
such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire 
worthless. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a 
unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the sham of common 
stock underlying such unit. 
We have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) business days, after the 
closing of our initial business combination, we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a registration 
statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the shares of common stock issuablc upon exercise of 
the warrants. We will use our best efforts to cause tlx: same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness 
of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in 
accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if our common stock is at 
the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition 
of a "covered security" under Section I8(b)( I ) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of 
public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so a "cashless bags" in accordance with Section 3(aX9) of the 
Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration 
statement or register or qualify the shares under blue sky laws. 
Once thc warrants become exercisable, we may call the warrants for redemption: 
• in whole and not in part; 
• at a price of $0.01 per warrant; 
• upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice of rd,.Enption (the "30-day redemption period") to each 
warrant holder, and 
• if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the common stock 'equals or exceeds $24.00 per share for any 
20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send to 
the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are 
unable to register or qualify the underlying severities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 
123 
We have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless 
there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are 
satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his, 
her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However. the price of the common stock may fall below 
the $24.00 redemption trigger price as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price (for whole shares) after the 
redemption notice is issued. 
If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require 
any holder that wishes to exercise his, her or its warrant to do so on a "cashless basis." In detcnnining whether to 
require all holders to exercise their warrants on a "cashless basis." our management will consider, among other 
factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that am outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders
