Corporations who operate prisons, such as the Correct=ons Corporation of America and The GEO Group, spend 
significant amounts of mone= lobbying the federal government along with state governments. The two aforementioned 
companies, the largest in the industry, have been contributo=s to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), 
which lobbies for poli=ies that would increase incarceration, such as three-strike laws and "truth-in-sentencing" 
legislation. Prison companies a=so sign contracts with states that guarantee at least 90 percent of prison beds be filled. 
If thes= "lockup quotas" aren't met, the state must reimburse the prison company for the unused beds. Prison 
companies use the profits to expand and put pressure on lawmakers to incarcerate a certain number of people. This 
influence on the government by the private prison industry has been referre= to as the Prison-industrial complex.

The "War on Drugs" is a policy that was ini=iated by Richard Nixon with the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and 
Control Act =f 1970 and vigorously pursued by Ronald Reagan. By 2010, drug offenders=in federal prison had increased 
to 500,000 per year, up from 41,000 in 1985. Drug related c=arges accounted for more than half the rise in state 
prisoners. 31 million people have been arrested on d=ug related charges, approximately 1 in 10 Americans. 
After the passage of Reagan's Anti-Drug Abuse Act=in 1986, incarceration for non-violent offenses dramatically 
increased. The Ac= imposed the same five-year mandatory sentence on users of crack as on those possessing 100 times 
as much powder cocaine. This had a disproportionate effect on low-level street dealers and users of crack, who were 
more common=y poor blacks, Latinos, the young, and women. Courts were given more discreti=n in sentencing by the 
Kimbrough v. United States (2007) decision, and the disparity was decreased to 18:1 by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. 
A= of 2006, 49.3% of state prisoners, or 656,000 individuals, were incarcerated for non-violent crimes. As of =008, 
90.7% of federal prisoners, or 165,457 individuals, were incarcerated for non-violent offenses.

By 2003, 58% of all women in federal prison were conv=cted of drug offenses. Women of color are disproportionately 
affected by the War on Drugs. African American wom=n's incarceration rates for all crimes, largely driven by drug 
convictions, have increased by 800% since 1986, compared to an increase of 400% for women of other races. Accor=ing 
to the American Civil Liberties Union, "Even when women have minimal or no involvement in the drug trade, they are 
increasingly caught in the ever-widening net cast by current drug laws, thr=ugh provisions of the criminal law such as 
those involving conspiracy, accompli=e liability, and constructive possession that expand criminal liability to re=ch 
partners, relatives and bystanders." 
These new policies also disproportionately affect Afr=can-American women. According to Dorothy E. Roberts, the 
explanation is that poor women,=who are disproportionately black, are more likely to be placed under constant 
supervision by the State in order to receive social services. They ar= then more likely to be caught by officials who are 
instructed to look specifically for drug offenses. Robert= argues that the criminal justice system's creation of new crimes 
has a =irect effect on the number of women, especially black women, who then become incarcerated.
