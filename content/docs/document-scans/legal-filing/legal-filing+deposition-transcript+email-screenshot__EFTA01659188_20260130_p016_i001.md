the future. The Journal says the World Trade Organization already has rules that let developing 
nations sidestep drug patents during emergencies, and that the waiver is not needed. The Hill

CDC Expects "Sharp Decline" In US COVID Cases By July. 
ABC World News TonightVi (5/5, lead story, 3:25, 6.42M) opened with what anchor David Muir 
called "major news on the coronavirus. ... For the first time, the CDC is now predicting a, 
quote, 'sharp decline' in cases by July, if we continue to see vaccinations and social distancing 
in areas where there are still hot spots. Today, that hopeful new tone from the CDC Director 
was welcome news. But Dr. Rochelle Walensky did say that the variants are still a wild card." 
Mola Lenghi said on the CBS Evening NewsVi (5/5, story 2, 2:20, O'Donnell, 4.03M), 
"There is new hope in the battle to beat COVID. The CDC is projecting the number of new cases 
could fall sharply by summer, but it comes with a warning: Any drop could be delayed by 
continued decline in vaccinations." Walensky: "Although we are seeing progress in terms of 
decreased cases, hospitalizations, and death, variants are a wild card that could reverse this 
progress we have made." 
Miguel Almaguer said on NBC Nightly NewsVi (5/5, lead story, 2:40, Holt, 5.3M), "The 
CDC now projects by July, the nation could turn the corner on the pandemic. New models show 
infections, hospitalizations, and deaths all plummeting if Americans continue to get vaccinated 
and take precautions. ... But the numbers are in a free fall. After peaking above four million 
shots in April, we're now below one million. ... With our nation at a turning point, the promise 
of change [is) intertwined with the need for vaccinations." 
The AP (5/5, Stobbe) reports that CDC experts published a new report, and they "are 
projecting COVID-19's toll on the U.S. will fall sharply by the end of July," but they also "warn 
that a 'substantial increase' in hospitalizations and deaths is possible if unvaccinated people do 
not follow basic precautions such as wearing a mask and keeping their distance from others." 
The CDC is currently "reporting an average of about 350,000 new cases each week, 35,000 
hospitalizations and over 4,000 deaths," but the cases "could drop below 50,000, 
hospitalizations to fewer than 1,000, and deaths to between 200 and 300" under the "most 
optimistic circumstances considered." 
Axios (5/5, Chen, 1.26M) reports the CDC also predicted a new COVID surge would hit the 
US in May in a statement released on Wednesday. While new daily cases "have declined in 
recent weeks, per data from Johns Hopkins University," public health officials "are urging people 
to remain vigilant as variants spread, some of which are more contagious and deadly than the 
original strain of the virus." 
The Washington Post (5/5, Achenbach, Sun, 10.52M) reports that the report "comes as 
administration officials and leaders in many states are sounding more confident that the 
country can return to a degree of normalcy relatively soon." Yet, the report "is not a prediction 
or forecast," and it "is a set of four scenarios based on modeling of the pandemic, using 
different assumptions about vaccination rates, vaccine efficacy and precautions against 
transmission." 
US Daily Vaccination Average Down To 2.2M From Peak Of 3.4M. 
CNBC (5/5, Rattner, 7.34M) reports on its website that CDC data show the US "is reporting an 
average of 2.2 million daily vaccinations over the past week, down from a peak of 3.4 million on 
April 13." CNBC adds that "the pace of individuals receiving their first vaccine doses has fallen 
even more steeply, indicating that there are fewer people initiating a vaccination program." 
Axios (5/5, Owens, 1.26M) notes that on Tuesday, the White House announced that 
President Biden's "new goal is to have 160 million Americans fully vaccinated and at least one 
shot administered to 70% of adults by July 4." According to Axios, "Slightly more than 56% of 
adults have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, meaning 14% more of the adult population 
has to get a shot before July 4 to reach the president's goal." Currently, "Around 106 million
