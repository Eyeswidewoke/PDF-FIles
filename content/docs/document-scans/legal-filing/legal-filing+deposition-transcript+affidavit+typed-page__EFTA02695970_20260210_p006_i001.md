transfer of money and the withdrawal and deposit of cash, essentially funded by mobile minutes on 
accunt. By virtue of the origin of the service and the resources devoted to developing it, M-Pesa is 
sophisticated technically and in terms of the features. As it has grown it also has far reaching business 
deals (ability to pay, deposit, and transfer money) with many national and international organizations. 
M-Pesa also represents a substantial portion of profit for Safaricom, the mobile operator that 
introduced the system. 
In Somaliland, there are two major mobile operators, TeleSom and SomTel. There is no telecom 
regulatory body, but the companies work with the government and agree on things like rates. Rates are 
very cheap and comparable to US per-minute rates, which are much cheaper than many other locations. 
Relative to banking there is an overburdened and undercapacitated central banking authority (the 
director's salary is $500 USD per year) 
Seeing the work by M-Pesa and the need amongst its own subscribers, TeleSom decided to develop a a 
mobile payment system. As you can imagine, the primary problem they set out to first solve was to 
make it easier for their existing customers (hundreds of thousands) to just buy more minutes/texts. You 
can imagine that a big thinking person (or a vendor or consultant from the developed world) might 
develop an "app" or use at least a WAP mobile web site, or just a PC web site. All of this would fail the 
test of working within the context of existing customers. This is a market that for the most part is using 
recycled handsets from around the world—there's a large presence of used phones for sale that don't 
even have color screens. And of course, there's no credit so all usage is pay per use. PC usage is very 
high but not readily accessible. To add a more functional challenge, transaction fees can't be part of the 
equation. 
Enter Zaad. /.1.1d, was introduced to TeleSom subscribers in 2009. The first goal was to increase usage 
and sell more minutes and to do so more efficiently. The system is a home grown platform and was 
built locally from the ground up. It currently has over 250,000 active users on a given month and on 
average a person is doing $30 of transactions per week and 50 transactions per month in an economy 
where the GDP per capita is less than $1.25 per day. The service will probably have 100% penetration 
among their customers. Let's look at the service. 
At the technical level, the service is built on the GSM standard .:SS:). It is sort of the orphan of the GSM 
standard like UDP is to TCP/IP. The neat thing about this is it allows for a simpler menu driven 
experience that looks sort of like a WAP site did in 1996 that works on the most basic feature phones—
no browser required. Some implementations of M-Pesa uses SMS and actually has a downside of 
requiring code (and code updates) on the phone to interpret SMS messages. That's not a readily 
scalable solution. 
In order to use the service you need a TeleSom SIM for your phone. In order to sign up you need to go 
to one of the official offices of TeleSom. The first thing that is wild about this is that you are essentially 
opening up a bank account, but you don't have an address, social security number, or anything to prove 
who you are. TeleSom developed their own system that involves a photograph and biometrics when 
you sign up. So any disputes later on can be resolved definitively. Because they are not the
