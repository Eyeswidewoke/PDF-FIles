The vast amount of debt at every level also raises the question whether the pool of savings is large enough to 
absorb it all. In the early 2000s there was no problem. Central banks and sovereign-wealth funds in the emerging 
economies seemed only too happy to recycle their current-account surpluses into the government bonds of rich 
countries. This forced down bond yields and tempted rich-world investors to look for better returns by buying 
mortgage-backed and high-yield corporate bonds. 
All that changed with the credit crunch. Suddenly the business sector found it very difficult to borrow. By 
contrast, governments found it easy because their debt was seen as safe. But once economies start expanding 
again, business and governments may start competing for the same pool of savings and the public sector may 
"crowd out" the private one. As the Greek crisis has shown, countries which want to dip into that pool would do 
well to keep their finances in order. 
If attracting international investors is too hard, governments will be tempted to lean on their domestic savers. 
Theo Zemek, who heads the fixed-income division at AXA, a giant insurance company, reckons that a combination 
of regulatory and accounting changes will encourage banks and insurance companies to buy more bonds, and 
ageing populations in the rich world will also want to hold more assets that produce fixed incomes. 
Historical factors such as legal, tax and monetary policy have provided incentives for consumers, companies and 
(crucially) the finance sector to pile on debt. The level of debt has become untenable, but the options for reducing 
it are not enticing. 
Here's how not to do It 
One example not to follow is Japan, which has suffered a long period of stagnation accompanied by ever-rising 
government-debt-to-GDP ratios. This has proved sustainable only because of the country's strong external 
position; it owes its debt to its own institutions. 
For nations that owe money to foreigners, a long period of stagnation is likely to lead to at least partial default. 
This may be the eventual outcome in Greece, despite the recent rescue package put together by the IMF and the 
EU. Ms Reinhart and Mr Rogoff argue that the world is due for a wave of sovereign defaults, which are common 
after serious financial crises. 
Another undesirable model is to inflate the debt away, as has often happened in the past. At the extreme, as in 
Germany in the 1920s, central banks "monetise" the debt, simply printing the money to allow the government to 
pay its bills. Some regard quantitative easing—in which central banks create money to buy financial assets, 
mainly government bonds—as monetisation by another name. But many countries may find this difficult, 
especially if they have a lot of short-term debt. Dhaval Joshi of RAB Capital, a hedge fund, explains that 53% of 
government debt will have to be rolled over by 2012, for example. If investors think inflation is set to rise, they 
will demand higher yields, increasing the cost of servicing the debt. 
Stagnate, default, inflate—they all seem equally grim. The best solution for rich countries is to work off their 
debts through economic growth. That may be harder for some than for others, given that many countries' 
workforces are set to level out or shrink as their populations age. It will be all the more important for such 
countries to pursue structural reforms that will increase productivity. 
But outgrowing debt is not easy: the McKinsey study found that, out of 32 cases of deleveraging following a 
financial crisis that it examined, only one was driven by growth. America, which has a younger workforce than 
Europe or Japan, might still manage it. But for many other countries the hole they have dug for themselves may 
already be too deep.
