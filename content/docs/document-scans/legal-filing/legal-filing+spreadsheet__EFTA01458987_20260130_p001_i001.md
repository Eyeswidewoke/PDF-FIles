World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
FX Strategy: Plenty of run left in the USD upswing 
• 
The multi-year strong USD cycle should extend for at least another two 
years, with a further 10% appreciation in the real broad USD WV'. 
• 
2016 year-end forecasts are largely unchanged, with EUR/USD. USD/JPY 
and GBP/USD seen at 0.90, 128 and 1.27 respectively. We anticipate 
extremes in the likes of AUD/USD. NZDiUSD and USD/CAD at 0.62, 0.53 
and 1.40 respectively. 
• 
In macro terms, how 2016 shapes up will be heavily influenced by whether 
the main macro driver is the Fed or China. If the Fed is the driver, USD 
gains are seen as likely to be slow and broad-based, spread fairly evenly 
between G4, commodity FX and EM FX. If on the other hand, China, 
particularly China FX policy, becomes a source of instability, USD gains 
will likely be heavily concentrated in commodity and EM FX, while the G4 
majors all outperform. 
The USD continues to conform to the multi-year cycle big USD cycles of the 
past. Since the fall of Bretton Woods, big USD down cycles of 9.10 years have 
been followed by big USD upswings of 6-7 years. While all cycles are different, 
the macro backdrop conforms to a view that we are about 2/3rds the way 
through the big USD up cycle, with the real broad index some 50 months into 
an upswing. In the same vein, the real Broad TWI has in past cycles largely 
retraced any prior cycle losses, and increased by 53% and 33% in the 1978 -
1985 and 1995 - 2002 upswings respectively. In the last downswing the USD 
real broad TWI fell by 28%. We expect that the USD will at a minimum fully 
retrace these losses, fitting with further real broad TWI gains in the order of 
10%. In magnitude terms we are then also likely to be a little over 2/3rds the 
way through the USD cycle, with USD gains henceforth likely to come at a 
slightly slower pace. 
The main departure in this cycle relative to past cycles is that the USD gains 
before the Fed starts hiking rates have been substantially larger than anything 
we have seen in any fed hiking cycle. This front-loading of USD gains fits with 
more modest USD gains to come. 
It would however be premature to think that we are close to a USD top. This 
cycle is also likely to be unique in a couple of respects that are very positive for 
the USD: 
(1) In this cycle, at least for the coming year the Fed, and perhaps the BOE are 
the only G10 Central Banks that are likely to tighten. This is in contrast to most 
Fed tightening cycles, when many G10 Central Banks are typically tightening. 
In the last Fed tightening cycle, all G10 Central Banks tightened. 
(ii) In addition, in this cycle many Central Banks are still leaning toward further 
accommodation, including not least in encouraging their own currency 
weakness. The US is one of the few countries willing to tolerate currency 
strength. 
iii) Some of the most important rate spreads for currencies, notably the 2yr US 
Treasury - Bund yield spread are seen moving in favor of the USD for the next 
5 years, if the respective forward curves prove correct. We expect that some of 
the likely rate spread adjustment will also end up being front-loaded into the 
next two years.
