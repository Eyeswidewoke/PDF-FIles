'Do you want it or not?' 
During the August 2009 meeting between Netanyahu and Merkel, Netanyahu requested a sixth submarine, to be 
purchased under a similar agreement; the deal would cost Germany 135 million euros, as a grant to Israel. Netanyahu's 
argument for the submarine was operational: Israel, he claimed, needed a sixth submarine to maintain continuous naval 
activity throughout the year. 
The chancellor agreed - but some Israeli officials pooh-poohed the deal. 
The Israeli navy argued that it needed additional up-to-date missile ships more than it did another submarine. The 
Defense Ministry, meanwhile, criticized the high cost of the submarine and refused to pay for it from its own budget. 
Ben Zeev says he was surprised to hear from a senior defense establishment figure at the time that there had been "no 
decision to invest in a sixth submarine." According to the former ambassador, "There were elements who opposed it 
and said it wasn't needed at all. The internal debate in Israel leaked to the Germans and they asked: 'What's going on? 
Do you want a submarine or don't you?" 
In May 2010 Ben Zeev met with Eyal Gabbai, the director general of the Prime Minister's Office at the time, who made it 
clear that the prime minister was still interested in the submarine deal. But by this point, other political factors had 
come into play. 
Two months earlier, during a visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden to Israel, a controversial tender was published for the 
construction of 1,600 housing units in Ramat Shlomo, located beyond the Green Line in Jerusalem. Along with 
Washington, Berlin was sharply critical of the agreement, and in coordination with the White House, Merkel phoned 
Netanyahu to voice her disapproval. Netanyahu's bureau leaked word of the conversation, along with the mendacious 
suggestion that Netanyahu had initiated the phone call with Merkel. 
"This was a great disappointment in Germany," Ben Zeev recalls. "At every meeting Merkel would say it is necessary to 
stop Iran and the settlements in order to save the vision of two states. The Germans did not believe the prime minister 
[when he said he] had not known in advance about the regional planning committee's decision in the matter of Ramat 
Shlomo. This weighed very heavily on relations." 
Two months later, when Gabbai attended a meeting in Berlin with Merkel's advisers to discuss the submarine, he 
received a clear message: German funding of the sixth submarine would be dependent on Israel's actions with regard to 
the settlements and peace talks with the Palestinians. 
The leading opponents of the deal were the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Frank-Walter Steinmeier (formerly 
the foreign minister ), and the chairman of the Green Party, Jurgen Tritten. 
"Both of them demanded that here be a connection between the grant and progress in the peace process or an Israeli 
gesture to the Palestinians," says Ben Zeev, adding that their opposition delayed closing the deal. 
"The Germans told us: 'We need to get [the deal] through Parliament; give us tools to deal with this," recalls Ben Zeev. 
Netanyahu was aware of the German position, according to Ben Zeev: "This also came up in his talks with Merkel. He 
explained to the Germans that the Palestinians did not want to come to the negotiating table even after the freeze on 
building in the settlements." 
In September of 2011, shortly after Germany helped thwart the Palestinian move to gain recognition as a state in the 
United Nations, another crisis erupted: In the midst of the mediation between Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority 
President Mahmoud Abbas, Merkel learned that Israel had approved the building of 1,100 housing units in the
