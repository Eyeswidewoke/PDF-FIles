Saudi Arabia and Jordan — whose conflicting agendas have threatened in =ecent days to pull the Syrian opposition 
apart. 
But Obama won't m=ke the all-encompassing commitment in Syria that some want because he fear= it would devour 
the remaining years of his presidency. 
This pragmatic line=on foreign policy was evident during Obama's trip to the Middle East 
chttp://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/obamas-mi=east-trips-leaves-behind-a-mix-of-hope-and-
skepticism/2013/03/23/e6ee8a08-=389-11e2-a3le-14700e2724e4_story.html> this month. Though the president is 
often criticized for his passive, "I=ading from behind" style, he made some notable advances on the trip. The=challenge, 
as always for Obama, will be to follow through with coherent =93from the front" leadership. 
Here are three stra=egic gains that emerged from the trip: 
Obama breathed a li=tle life back into an Israeli-Palestinian peace process that had all but e=pired. He did this largely by 
the force of his March 21 speech chttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/03=21/how-obama-
just-reframed-the-israel-palestine-conflictk in Israel. What he accomplished was the diplomat's trick of riding two 
horses at once: The =peech was a love letter to Israel, as one commentator noted, and it was al=o a passionate 
evocation of the Palestinians' plight, and the need to =93Iook at the world through their eyes." 
Obama pulled Israel= Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toward the U.S. position on military ac=ion against Iran. 
Netanyahu saidg=pan> <http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/obama-arrives-in-isra=l-for-three-day-
visit/2013/03/20/a01774aa-914f-11e2-9abd-e4c5c9dc5e90_stor..html> that "if Iran decides to go for a nuclear weapon 
— that is, to actuall= manufacture the weapon — then . . . it will take them about a year." =e said the United States and 
Israel share "a common assessment" of Ira=. This sounded close to agreement with Obama's position that the trigger for 
a military strike would be an Iranian breako=t toward a bomb; that's quite different from the "zone of immunity" 
=rguments Netanyahu was making last =ear <http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/benjamin-
=etanyahu-invokes-holocaust-in-push-against-iran/2012/02/23/gIQAFKdkhR_stor=.html> , which viewed Iran's very 
position of enrichment technology as the threat= These exchanges demonstrated that Obama is stronger politically than 
he w=s a year ago and Netanyahu is weaker. The Israeli prime minister is now tr=ing to associate himself with Obama's 
Iran policy, rather than pressuring him. 
Obama brokered an i=portant reconciliation between Netanyahu and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/obama-end=-israel-visit-by-honoring-historic-
figures/2013/03/22/7a489fc4-92e9-11e2-b=Sb-SS0c7abf6384_story.html> .=With the region in turmoil, this was a 
matter of vital national interest f=r both Israel and Turkey, but it took Obama to provide the personal link t=at made it 
happen. This was a payoff for Obama's cultivation of Erdogan since 2010, and for his "reset" w=th Netanyahu. 
Syria remains the t=st of whether Obama can, forgive the term, "lean in" more during his s=cond term. Obama has been 
slow to see the dangers of U.S. passivity there:=For months he let things drift in Syria; the United States had a nominal 
commitment to strengthening command-and-co=trol within the opposition but no real policy on the ground to 
accomplish =t. 
Obama is now said t= understand the risk that Syria's sectarian conflict will spread to Leba=on, Iraq and Jordan if the 
United States doesn't take stronger action. T=e White House is eager to work with Brig. Gen. Salim Idriss, the 
commander of the Free Syrian Army, on training, log=stics and other priorities. The administration recognizes that it may 
need="safe zones," perhaps protected by air defenses, to train Syrian rebel= inside the country rather than in Jordan 
and Turkey. 
The president is st=ll said to resist the simple formula of "arm the rebels," but he seems=close to partnering with 
friendly intelligence services in the region on w=at would be a major covert action program, reminiscent of Afghanistan 
in the 1980s <http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publi=ation/19149/covert_action.html> , with all the attendant risks.
