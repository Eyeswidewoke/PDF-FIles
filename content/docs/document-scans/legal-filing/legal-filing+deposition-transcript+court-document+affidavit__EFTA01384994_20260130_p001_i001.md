included in inventory if on hand at the close of the taxable year or (ii) held primarily for sale to 
customers in the ordinary course of business other than foreclosure property. 
• If we fail to satisfy either the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test discussed 
below, but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because other requirements arc 
met, we will be subject to a tax equal to the gross income attributable to the greater of either 
(I) the amount by which we fail the 75% gross income test for the taxable year or (2) the 
amount by which we fail the 95% gross income test for the taxable year, multiplied by a fraction 
intended to reflect our profitability. 
• If we fail to satisfy any of the REIT asset tests, as described below, other than a failure by a de 
minimis amount of the 5% or 10% assets tests, and we qualify for and satisfy certain cure 
provisions, then we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the product 
of (x) the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period in which we failed 
to satisfy the asset tests and (y) the highest U.S. federal income tax rate then applicable to 
corporations. 
• If we fail to satisfy any provision of the Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a 
REIT (other than a gross income or asset test requirement) and that violation is due to 
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, we may retain our REIT qualification, but we 
will be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. 
• If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT because we fail to distribute by the end of the 
relevant year any earnings and profits we inherit from a taxable C corporation during the year 
(e.g., by tax-free merger or tax-free liquidation), and the failure is not due to fraud with intent to 
evade tax, we generally may retain our REIT status by paying a special distribution, but we will 
be required to pay an interest charge on 50% of the amount of undistributed non-REIT 
earnings and profits. 
• We may be required to pay monetary penalties to the IRS in certain circumstances, including if 
we fail to meet record-keeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules 
relating to the composition of our stockholders, as described below in "—Requirements for 
Qualification as a REIT." 
• We will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution 
over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax 
was paid, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our REIT 
ordinary income for the year, 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for the year and any 
undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years. 
• We will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on some payments we receive (or on certain expenses 
deducted by our TRSs) if arrangements among us, our tenants and/or our TRSs are not 
comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties. 
• We may be subject to tax on gain recognized in a taxable disposition of assets acquired by way 
of a tax-free merger or other tax-free reorganization with a non-REIT corporation or a tax-free 
liquidation of a non-REIT corporation into us. Specifically. to the extent we acquire any asset 
from a C corporation in a carry-over basis transaction and we subsequently recognize gain on a 
disposition of such asset during the ten-year period beginning on the date on which we acquired 
the asset, then, to the extent of any "built-in gain." such gain will be subject to U.S. federal 
income tax, sometimes called the "sting tax," at the highest regular corporate tax rate, which is 
currently 35%. Built-in gain means the excess of (i) the fair market value of the asset as of the 
beginning of the applicable recognition period over (ii) our adjusted basis in such asset as of the 
beginning of such recognition period. Sec "—Sting Tut on Built-in Gains of Former C 
Corporation Assets."
