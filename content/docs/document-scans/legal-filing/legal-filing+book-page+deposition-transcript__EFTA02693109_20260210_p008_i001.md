central regions (figure 5(C)). As in the calibration phase, EEG 
data from 50 ms in the past supplied the most information. In 
source space at 50 ms in the past, compared to the calibration 
phase. a large shift occurred from anterior (frontocentral) to 
posterior (centroposterior) neural regions. More specifically. 
there was much less involvement of the LPC, the PrG and 
PoG exhibited an even more widespread involvement, and 
the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) made a large contribution 
(figure 5(D)). 
3.4. Eye and muscle contributions 
A concern in BCI studies is that eye or muscle movements 
may contaminate EEG signals thereby inadvertently aiding 
the control of a device/environment that should be controlled 
by thought-generated neural signals alone. To address this 
concern, we executed the off-line decoding procedure with 
channels of vertical and horizontal EOG activity included, 
and assessed the percent contribution of these eye channels 
(table 2). 
The percent contributions were low for the 
calibration and target acquisition phases except for a very 
high percent contribution (94.9%) to .r velocity reconstruction 
for subject 4 during target acquisition. 
Interestingly. 
this subject had the lowest decoding accuracy of all 
participants, suggesting that eye movements disrupted 
decoding. Furthermore. the fact that hardly any extreme 
frontal contribution is observed in the scalp maps and 
sLORETA plots (figure 5) is a testament to the non-
contribution of EOG activity to decoding To access whether 
muscle activity aide) cursor control, we cross-correlated EMG 
signals from flexor and extensor muscles of the right forearm 
with the x and y components of cursor velocity to find that all 
correlations were low (table 3).

4. Discussion 
We 
report 
the 
first EEG-based BCI system 
that 
employs continuous decoding of imagined continuous hand 
movements. Furthermore. we emphasize that the system 
requires only a single session of decoder calibration 
(--20 min) and subject practice (-20 min) before subjects 
can operate it. The off-line decoding results of the calibration 
phase that used observation of biologically plausible cursor 
movement were higher than those of invasive BCI studies 
and may imply, as discussed below, the involvement of a 
widespread MNS in humans. In the on-line target acquisition 
phase, subjects controlled a cursor with their EEG signals 
alone with accuracies comparable to other noninvasive and 
invasive BCI studies aimed at 2D cursor control. 
4.1. Comparison to other BCI studies 
Our study is the first noninvasive EEG-based BCI study to 
employ continuous decoding of imagined natural movement. 
Previous work in EEG-based BCI systems for cursor control 
required subjects to overcome an initial disconnect between 
intended movement and neural activity in order to learn 
how to modulate their sensorimotor rhythms to control the 
cursor. These studies based on sensorimotor rhythms required 
weeks to months of training before levels of performance 
were deemed sufficient for reporting (Wolpaw and McFarland 
2004). We believe the fact that we used a decoder based 
on imagined/observed natural movement, as opposed to 
neurofeedback training of sensorimotor rhythms, reduced the 
subject training requirements of our target acquisition phase 
to only a single brief practice session (-20 mint 
An ECoG study based on sensorimotor rhythms that had 
objectives similar to ours also observed that several subjects 
learned to control a 21) cursor over a short period of time 
(Schalk et al 2008). Although this ECoG study reduced 
training time compared to previous EEG studies (Wolpaw 
and McFarland 2004), some drawbacks included that pre-
training time was still taken for the initial selection of control 
features and for training subjects to first move the cursor in 
one dimension at a time. We were able to bypass these two 
pre-training steps. Another drawback of the ECoG study was 
that all five subjects used overt movement for initial selection 
of features, and two subjects used overt movement throughout 
the study. 
Additionally, the results of our target acquisition phase 
compare favorably to those in tetraplegic humans that were 
implanted with intraconical arrays in the arm area of MI 
(Hochberg et al 2006, Kim et al 2008) even though the 
performance results of those studies were only computed on 
data collected weeks to months after training began. Table 4 
compares our study to the aforementioned studies. 
4.2. Differential encoding of observed and brain-controlled 
cursor velocity 
The most notable differences between the regions that encoded 
for observed cursor velocity and brain-controlled cursor 
velocity were with the PIG, PoG, IPL and LPC. There was
