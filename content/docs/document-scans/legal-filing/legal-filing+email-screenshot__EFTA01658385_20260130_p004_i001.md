LEADING THE NEWS 
Kenosha's Police Chief Blames Deadly Shooting On Protesters Breaking Curfew. 
The New York Post (8/27, Brown, 4.57M) reports "Kenosha's police chief has blamed protesters 
for the deaths during riots in the Wisconsin city - saying the bloodbath only happened because 
they defied a state-of-emergency curfew." Chief Daniel Miskinis told reporters, "Everybody 
involved was out after the curfew. ... The point is, the curfew is in place to protect. Had persons 
not been out involved in violation of that, perhaps the situation that unfolded would not have 
happened. ... The result of it is two people dead." 
ABC World News TonightVi (8/27, story 2, 2:55, Alex Perez, 6.48M) showed a "graphic 
video capturing the chaos: A crowd appears to be chasing the armed man when he falls to the 
ground and starts firing. As police approach the scene, Rittenhouse can be seen with his hands 
up, but he's never taken into custody." ABC also reported it had just "learned the 17-year-old 
has been officially charged with two counts of homicide and one count of attempted homicide. 
That extradition hearing to bring him from Illinois back here to Wisconsin is set" for Friday 
morning. 
The Washington Post (8/27, Armus, 14.2M) reports that Rittenhouse "shadowed local law 
enforcement as a cadet and filled his social media feeds with posts declaring that 'Blue Lives 
Matter.' There were videos from the front row of a Trump rally, and photos of himself posing 
with guns." The AP (8/27, Ortutay, Snow) further recounts that there were "repeated calls for 
armed vigilantes to travel to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to protect businesses" on "social media in the 
hours before two people were shot to death and a third was wounded" on Tuesday night. 
The Washington Post (8/27, Armus, 14.2M) reports that "before he took his rifle to 
confront the unrest in Kenosha...on Tuesday, allegedly killing two people and injuring another," 
Rittenhouse "seemingly idolized one thing: the police. ... So much so that, when massive 
protests, looting and fires broke out in Kenosha following the police shooting of Jacob Blake on 
Sunday, he crossed state lines to offer his support to local policemen - at times, speaking as if 
their duties were his, too." 
Wisconsin Poll: Approval Of BLM Protests Dropped 13 Points Between June And 
Early August. The Washington Examiner (8/27, Colton, 448K) reports "a new poll out of 
Wisconsin shows support for Black Lives Matter protests dropped 13 percentage points between 
June and early August." The Examiner adds "forty-eight percent of Wisconsin residents support 
Black Lives Matter protests and 48% disapprove, according to a Marquette Law School poll 
conducted between Aug. 8 and Aug. 9." Marquette had "found 61% of residents approved of the 
movement's protests from June 14 to June 18, with 36% disapproving."
