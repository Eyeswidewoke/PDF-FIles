To be sure, there is plenty of evidence that some corporations sometimes can do best 
for their shareholders by doing good for all corporate stakeholders. 'J.' There are some 
investment funds which in [" 205] vest only in firms that are "socially responsible." Some 
of these funds have outperformed investment funds without "social responsibility" 
restrictions or purposes. n" It is not at all surprising that corporate operations that actually 
serve the interests of all stakeholders would be among the best performing firms in the 
market. But this success in no way casts doubt on the fact that there are other profit 
opportunities that are available in more exploitative arrangements that lie beyond the 
parameters of the social responsibility investment funds, but well within the parameters of 
the law. There is plenty of evidence that there are times when the profitable thing is for a 
corporation to act sharp with one of its stakeholders. Just because the forty dollars lying on 
the ground at the top of the sunny hill will be seen and gathered does not mean that the 
twenty dollars buried under the ground in the dark valley will be left alone. 'm [" 206] 
It is therefore important to emphasize that the problems that corporate law presents for 
non-shareholders cannot be remedied by hoping for better corporate governance within 
the shareholder primacy paradigm. The Pareto fallacy of corporate profitability debilitates 
honest discussion and communication about hard choices that need to be made in social 
policy. 
In its most complete articulation, shareholder primacy theory is not committed to the 
claim that shareholder primacy in firm governance will always serve all stakeholder 
interests. Instead, the dominant view is dependent upon the idea that government 
regulation can protect non-shareholders from corporate misconduct where contract proves 
an inadequate mechanism to protect non-shareholders from the exploitative power of the 
shareholder primacy firm. ^,• The trouble is that shareholder primacy itself compels firms to 
work within the political realm to undermine the development of such profit-stifling 
regulations. In other work I have analyzed the broad public choice dynamics which inhibit 
the proper functioning of the political systems on which shareholder primacy theory relies 
for its coherence. -*Here I am concerned with analyzing in particular the irreconcilability of 
the discourse norms that govern corporate political speech, on the one hand, [` 207] and 
those that are expected in the arena of political speech, on the other. 
c. Corporate Political Speech and the Norm of Public Reason 
Modern liberal political theory considers speech to be an essential element of 
legitimacy in social organization. 
Political theorists argue that people have a 
fundamental moral obligation to speak with each other about proposed solutions to hard 
and contested problems. ^" Speaking with each other provides us a non-violent, orderly, 
reasonable way of getting along with each other even though we may strongly disagree 
about important matters. m' 
It is not just any speech, but rather a particular kind of restrained speech which is 
needed if society is to successfully evade the destructive threat of other forms of dispute 
resolution, such as fighting. The liberal political tradition has developed a discourse norm 
of "public reason" which purports to fit the bill. The norm of public reason differs from the 
discourse norms evident in family, fiduciary, contractual, or legal-adversarial relationships. 
The purpose of the norm of public reason is "to identify normative premises all political 
participants find reasonable (or at least, not unreasonable)." — The norm of [' 208] public
