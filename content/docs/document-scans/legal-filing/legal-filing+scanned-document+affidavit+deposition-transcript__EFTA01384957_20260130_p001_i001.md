acres and 4,962 gross acres. Development farms for permanent crops generally will not generate lease 
income for periods of between four and seven years, depending on the crop, with certain permanent 
crop types, such as pistachios, taking up to nine years, with others, such as conversions of an orchard to 
a vegetable farm taking one to three years, and will generally be considered to be development farms 
until commercially productive. As of the date of this prospectus, five of these farms are expected to 
become mature and productive in the next three years, including 77 acres of Quail Run Vineyard that 
are currently subject to development, but which is not included in this segment as the majority of the 
farm is mature and crop producing. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Use of Estbnotes 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with ()AAP requires the use of 
management's estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ 
from those estimates. 
Investments in Real Estate 
Investments in real estate consist of farmland and improvements made to the farmland, consisting 
of buildings; wells, irrigation and drain systems; and trees and vines acquired in connection with the 
land purchase. Investments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements, replacements and costs 
of development for new trees and vines, or the repurposing of raw land, arc capitalized when they 
extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance arc 
expensed as such costs are incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. The estimated useful lives range from ten to fifteen 
years for land improvements, twenty-five years for buildings, one to thirty years for trees and vines, and 
five and eight years for fixtures and equipment, respectively. 
Impairment 
We account for the impairment of real estate, including intangible assets, in accordance with 
ASC 360-10-35, "Property, Plant, and Equipment," which requires us to periodically review the carrying 
value of each property to determine whether circumstances indicate impairment of the carrying value of 
the investment exists or if depreciation periods should be modified. If circumstances support the 
possibility of impairment, we prepare a projection of the undiscounted future cash flows, without 
interest charges, of the specific property and determine whether the carrying value of the investment in 
such property is recoverable. In performing the analysis, we consider such factors as agricultural and 
business conditions in the regions in which our farms are located, and the development period (if 
applicable). and whether there are indications that the fair value of the real estate has decreased. If the 
carrying amount is more than the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we would recognize an 
impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. 
We evaluate our entire property portfolio each quarter for any impairment indicators and perform 
an impairment analysis. We concluded that none of our properties were impaired as of June 30, 2015 
or 2014 or as of December 31, 2014 or 2013, and we will continue to monitor our portfolio for any 
indicators of impairment. There have been no impairments recognized on real estate assets since our 
inception. This evaluation is subjective and is based in part on management's judgment and 
assumptions, which could differ materially from actual results.
