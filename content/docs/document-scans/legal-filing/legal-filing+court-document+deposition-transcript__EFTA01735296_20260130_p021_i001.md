Extradition Offences 
The defence argues that the offences in the EAW are not extradition offences and the court should therefore 
order the person's discharge under section 10 Extradition Act. Argument is set out in the skeleton dated 4th 
February 2010, issues 6 and 7; and further argument in the closing submissions. The defence adopts the opinion 
of Professor Ashworth, although it appears that Professor Ashworth was not specifically asked to comment on 
extradition cases on this point, such as Zak, Ulatowski and NO171S, nor does he refer to section 75 SOA 2003, 
see below. 
There arc four allegations as set out in box (c) of the warrant 
1. On 13th — 14th August 2010, in the home of the injured party [name given] in Stockholm, 
Assange, by using violence, forced the injured party to endure his restricting her freedom of 
movement. The violence consisted in a firm hold of the injured party's arms and a forceful 
spreading of her legs whilst lying on top of her and with his body weight preventing her from 
moving or shifting. 
2. On 13th —14th August 2010, in the home of the injured party [name given] in Stockholm, Assange 
deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner designed to violate her sexual 
integrity. Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured party and a 
prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, consummated unprotected sexual 
intercourse with her without her knowledge. 
3. On 18th August 2010 or on any of the days before or after that date, in the home of the injured 
party [name given] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a 
manner designed to violate her sexual integrity i.e. lying next to her and pressing his naked, 
erect penis to her body. 
4. On 17th August 2010, in the home of the injured party [name given] in Enkoping, Assange 
deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to 
sleep, was in a helpless state. 
It is an aggravating circumstance that Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish 
of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, still 
consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her. The sexual act was designed to violate 
the injured party's sexual integrity. 
The framework list is ticked for "Rape". This is a reference to an allegation 4. The other three allegations arc 
described in box (e) II using the same wording as set out above. 
As far as offences, 1,2, and 3 arc concerned it is argued that these do not constitute extradition offences because 
the conduct alleged would not amount to an offence against English law. The court must apply the "conduct 
test" of double criminality. That means the court must consider whether the conduct alleged would amount to 
an offence under English law as if it had occurred in this jurisdiction. The applicant must establish this 
proposition to the criminal standard of proof. What must be proved is that the conduct, if it were established, 
would constitute the extradition offence relied on here. Although detailed separate argument has been made 
about each of the three offences, it amounts in essence to this: the description provided does not permit an 
inference that there was a lack of consent by the complainant, nor that the respondent did not reasonably believe 
the complainant to be consenting.
