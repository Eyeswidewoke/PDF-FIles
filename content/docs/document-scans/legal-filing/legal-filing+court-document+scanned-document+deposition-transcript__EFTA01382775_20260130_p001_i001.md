Listing 
We intend to appb to list our Class A common stock on the NYSE under the symbol "FDC." In order to meet the requirements for 
listing on that exchange. the underwriters have undertaken to sell a minimum number of shares to a minimum number of beneficial owners as 
required by that exchange. 
Before this offering. there has been no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price will be determined through 
negotiations between us and the representatives. In addition to prevailing market conditions, the factors to be considered in determining the initial 
public offering price are 
the valuation multiples of publicly traded companies that the representatives believe to be comparable to us; 
• 
our financial information; 
• 
the history of, and the prospects for, our Company and the industry in which we compete: 
• 
an assessment of our management, its past and present operations, and the prospects for, and timing of, our future revenues; 
the present state of our development; and 
• 
the above factors in relation to market values and various valuation measures of other companies engaged in activities similar to ours. 
An active trading market for the shares may not develop. It is also possible that after the offering the shares will not trade in the public 
market at or above the initial public offering price. 
The underwriters do not expect to sell more than 5% of the shares in the aggregate to accounts over which they exercise discretionary 
authority. 
Price Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids 
Until the distribution of the stiana is completed. SEC rules may limit underwriters and selling group members from bidding for and 
purchasing our common stock. However, the representatives may engage in transactions that stabilize the price of the common stock, such as bids 
or purchases to peg, fix or maintain that price. 
In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell our common stock in the open market. These transactions may 
include short sales, purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales and stabilizing transactions. Short sales involve the sale 
by the underwriters of a rater number of shares than they arc required to purchase in the offering. "Covered" short sales are sales made in an 
amount not greater than the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares described above. The underwriters may close out any covered short 
position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares 
to close out the covered short position. the underwriters will consider, among other things. the price of shares available for purchase in the open 
market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the option granted to them. "Naked" short sales are sales in excess of 
such option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more 
likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of our common stock in the open market 
after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of 
shares of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. 
The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the 
underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in 
stabilizing or short covering transactions.
