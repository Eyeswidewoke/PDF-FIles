AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS): Gloomy Anticipated 
40 Results Likely the Bottom; Entire Structure up to BUY 
Investment Thesis 
Despite what we would characterize as a rather less-encouraging quarter from 
the integrated steelmaker in 3017, we still see value in AKS' outstanding notes 
and expect them to appreciate from today's levels once we get past what will 
likely be a dismal Q4-2017. AKS guided to lackluster results in 4Q due to input 
cost inflation amid stable steel prices that are likely to achieve higher levels 
and cover the cost inflation in 01.2018. After a strong beginning to 2017, AKS' 
2H-2017 results have underperformed expectations on account of higher-than-
anticipated planned maintenance expense (which should be viewed as a 
positive in that AKS actually regularly services its various facilities, unlike some 
other steel peers) coupled with inflationary input costs. We are reinforcing our 
positive view of the steelmaker considering 1) the market is aware that 4017 is 
likely to be a bad quarter, 2) domestic steel pricing and capacity utilization is 
on the rise, and 3) we expect price hikes to offset increased input cost expense 
in 1018. More, the highest proportion of AKS' contracted prices renew around 
yearend; given higher spot steel prices, we would expect AKS' contracted-part 
of its pricing matrix to be higher YoY, particularly with automakers, which 
should help mitigate any potential volume weakness on the automotive front. 
Lastly, AKS' Precision Partners acquisition in July 2017 has yet to anniversary a 
full year of earnings and we expect 1H-2018 to benefit from the acquisition. 
Hecornmendat ion 
Hence given our belief that most of this weakness is already baked-in to price 
levels, we are moving the entire capital structure to a Buy rating. We initiate 
on the 6.375% senior notes due 2025 (98.75 price, 6.6% YTW, 405 OAS) with a 
Buy rating. We are also increasing our rating on AKS' 7.625% senior notes due 
2021 (103.75 price, 5.0% YTW. 333 OAS) to a Buy rating due to our 
expectation that AKS will come to market and refinance the earliest maturing 
note in 2018 now that the bonds have become callable at 103.813%. We 
reiterate our Buy rating on AKS' 7.5% senior secured notes due 2023 (108.25 
price, 4.3% YTW, 233 OAS). While the 7.5% secured notes are rated B1/BB-, 
we see them as an upgrade candidate to Ba3 by Moody's and believe they 
should trade more in line with 88 credits, especially considering a strong 
collateral package, inability to layer and solid 1.7x net leverage ratio. Similarly, 
we reiterate our Buy rating on AKS' 7.0% senior notes due 2027 (101.750 price, 
6.7% YTW, 412 OAS) for the reasons listed above.
