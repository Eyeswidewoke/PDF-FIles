The big picture 
China's transformation from dragon to panda - a process that cannot be 
completely controlled by the government, but will open up opportunities. 
Beijing must 
get used to the 
unpredictability 
of free capital 
markets. 
Mr. Wehrmann, we had planned to talk 
about the turnaround in U.S. rate policy. 
However, the Chinese central bank (PBoC) 
stole the Fed's thunder in August. It 
followed in the steps of the Swiss National 
Bank (SNB) and shocked the markets 
by taking a step back from currency 
intervention. Now, the yuan is no longer 
strictly pegged to the U.S. dollar. Supply 
and demand will influence the exchange 
rate to a greater extent. That has caused 
considerable market turmoil. Why have 
investors reacted so nervously? 
in China's case, the currency-market 
reaction was still relatively moderate, not 
least due to the support measures taken 
bythe PBoC. The yuan depreciated by 
about 5% versus the U.S. dollar within 
three days and then stabilized. However, 
due to its peg to the U.S. dollar it had 
previously appreciated against most other 
currencies and, in fact, the real effective 
exchange rate of the yuan has appreciated 
50% versus the U.S. dollar since the 
financial crisis. Against this background, 
a yuan devaluation actually makes sense. 
But markets seemed to regard this step 
as an admission of the PBoC that China's 
economy is weak. 
What will happen now to the yuan? 
That remains to he seen On the one hand. 
China wants to be adequately represented 
in international institutions In view of its 
economic strength. That is why it wants 
to comply with the recommendations of 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
in order to have the yuan included in its 
Special Drawing Rights (S0R) basket. 
Moreover, China is quite aware of the fact 
that, in the long run. it will need to accept 
that key variables such as interest rates, 
loan volumes and the exchange rate are 
determined by the market. In tact, a more 
relaxed exchange-rate regime is only one 
of several measures Beijing has taken in 
order to liberalize the capital markets. On 
the other hand, Beijing is still reluctant 
to totally give up control over these key 
variables. In all probability, the PBoC 
will peg the yuan to a broader currency 
basket while preserving some scope for 
action in the medium term. In the long 
run it will float the yuan and intervene 
only sporadically. From my vantage point, 
this is necessary and useful, A country 
of this size, which moreover has a share 
of almost one-sixth in total global trade, 
cannot peg its currency to that of another 
country. A more relaxed exchange-rate 
regime will enable quicker exchange-
rate adjustments, which will help to 
counteract or even prevent large-scale 
market imbalances. 
The devaluation accelerated the 
downtrend on global stock markets. Was 
it an accident that the PBoC took this step 
just at this point in time? 
Of course, the devaluation has to be 
seen in the context of the economic 
environment as a whole. Investors 
thought it was another sign of China's 
growth slowdown. At the same time, 
Past performance is not indicative of future returns. it is not possible to invest directly 
in an index. No assurance can be given that any forecast or target will be reached. 
Forecasts are based on assumptions, estimates, opinions and hypothetical models or 
analyses that may prove to be incorrect. Investments come with risk. The value of an 
investment can fall as well as rise and your capital may be at risk. You might not get 
back the amount originally invested at any point in time.
