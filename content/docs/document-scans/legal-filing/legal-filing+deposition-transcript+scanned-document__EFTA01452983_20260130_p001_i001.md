Signals to Noise (S2N) 
idea which is actually very challenging to implement in a small form factor. To date, 
only 2X2 MIMO has been achieved on the handset, which makes their 4X4 solution all 
the more compelling. 
Personal encryption and privacy was a new theme and garnered a lot of interest at the 
show. The Blackphone booth (not to be confused with Blackberry), run by SPG 
Technologies, was constantly packed, with many questions about availability and how 
the solution actually worked. The solution secures data at the application level, and 
while not yet ready to prevent NSA and hacker snoops, the attempts at trying to restore 
personal privacy garnered that attention of many at the show. At the same time Boeing 
lobbed in announcement from afar, suggesting they would have a fully encrypted 
handset by the end of the year, but not made available to the general public. Given the 
excitement around both solutions, our sense is that this budding area could grow into 
something significant given most people's wariness of big brother issues in both the 
States and elsewhere. In terms of how it affects the industry, we believe it could be a 
potential risk for Blackberry (or opportunity), with end-to-end encryption being a key 
advantage of their platform. 
Blackberry clears up muddied Al D tvl strategy, launches new devices 
Blackberry likely won for the most press releases during Mobile World Congress. In the 
bevy of statements, we found their clarification of MDM pricing with EZPass to be the 
most resonant of all of them. The new pricing scheme breaks down their MDM solution 
into two, clear levels, which make it simple for any customer to understand. Before 
now, with the strategy implemented by the previous CEO, BES 10 had a "buffet-style" 
approach to pricing, which was both unclear and at odds with previous Blackberry 
pricing schemes. The new, simpler approach corrects these. The company also 
launched a couple handsets, one for the Indonesian market and one that returns to the 
company's roots of keyboards and trackballs. While the new handset design 
complements their end-to-end approach, we believe any hopes of traction in the 
consumer market will likely be muted by the ongoing increasing competition in 
smartphones in general and Blackberry's inability to gain application momentum with 
BES 10 specifically. Overall, we think management continues to make smart decisions 
about the way forward. It is difficult not to think about what could have been had these 
decision been implemented years ago. In spite of management's attempts at a 
turnaround however, our belief is it is too late, at least to justify the current market cap 
size of the company. We believe that they could be successful as a much smaller 
company with a smaller market cap. Asa result, we maintain our Hold here. 
The front endgame 
Last year, we suggested that there would be consolidation in the frontend space, 
engineered by the active players - a result of Qualcomm's then announcement of RF 
360, a completely integrated frontend solution on CMOS (eventually). While the 
complete solution is still a goal Qualcomm has yet to achieve using their internal 
elements alone, they do feel as though they will have a very competitive, complete 
solution within three years (not five as we suggest). At the show the company 
announced a win with ZTE for their latest front-end solutions, the QFE2320 and 
QFE2340. The solution integrates QCOM's version of envelope tracking, the power 
amplifier, antenna switch and high band amplifier on one platform. While Qualcomm 
announced a design win, other front-end players were busy both making deals and 
displaying their wares. 
Before the show, RFMD announced a bid for Triquint, attempting to grab one of the 
two main players in BAW filters (Avago being the other). We do not feel like this is the
