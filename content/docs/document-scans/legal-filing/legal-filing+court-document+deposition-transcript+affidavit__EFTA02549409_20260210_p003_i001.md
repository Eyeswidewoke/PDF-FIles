- The conference attendee =ho took the 'selfie' photo did not lodge a formal =omplaint to the conference organisers at 
the =ime of the incident (November 2016). 
- The =onference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal =omplaint to the conference organisers at 
the =ime of the incident (November 2016). 
-The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide =vidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant =lleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the =onference attendee who took 
the 'selfie' =hoto. This photo was not made available to the Australian National =niversity, although it was requested in 
the =ourse of the investigation." 
(And for the record I often put my hand up =n front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request =elfies not to 
include flashes, so that I don't end up with a =eries bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour. 
=nbsp;Moreover, I have no idea if the other eyewitnesses you quote, who =ere not involved in any complaint, were in 
fact there but this was a =ormal banquet with individuals and their partners, which I attended =ong enough to agree to 
sign things and do selfies before leaving early =ecause I was tired. Even if I had any such intent it would have been 
=unacy to pose for selfies in front of a group and openly do such a =hing, including presumably in front of this person's 
partner, . =hich, besides the fact that I don't do such things, is one of =he many reasons it never happened.) 
What makes this particular type of =llegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of =elfies, and when 
people come up to me they are vulnerable, often =haking, or sometimes aggressive. I am particularly proud of the =ay I 
work to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than =umiliated, whatever their behavior or request. Thus, 
this false claim =trikes at the heart of what I am about, which characterizes all my =nteractions with fans: to 
acknowledge them in a way that makes them =eel appreciated and respected. As I understand you had a =eporter 
watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI conference =n Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will 
have witnessed =nd should report on. Moreover, I am proud of the interactions I have =ad at both Case and ASU, with 
students, colleagues and staff of all =enders and ethnicities. I have worked hard to support them, =entor them, and 
treat them with respect. I treat others as =esponsible adults, and I expect to be treated =qually.

In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two =niversities had investigated an incident (# 6
