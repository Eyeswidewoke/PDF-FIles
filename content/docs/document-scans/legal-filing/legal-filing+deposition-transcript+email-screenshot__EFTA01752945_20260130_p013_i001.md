The survey's result= provide insight into the perceptions, experiences and self-conception of =uropean Jews. Rather than 
supplying absolute figures on anti-Semitic attac=s, the study focuses on the perceived danger of such attacks and how 
much the anxiety this causes affects their =ives. Two-thirds of respondents (66%) said that anti-Semitism is a p=oblem in 
Europe, and over three-quarters (76%) noted that there had been a= increase in anti-Semitic hostility in their home 
countries over the last five years. Close to half of r=spondents (46%) are afraid of being verbally attacked or harassed in 
a pub=ic place because they are Jewish, while a third (33%) worry that such atta=ks could turn physical. Roughly 50 
percent of surveyed parents or grandparents of school-aged children worry =hat their children could be victims of anti-
Semitic verbal insults or hara=sment at or on the way to or from school if they wore visible Jewish symbo=s in public. 
More than half of respondents (57%) said that, over the last 12 months, they had heard or se=n someone claim that the 
Holocaust was a myth or that it has been exaggera=ed. 
About a quarter (26=) of respondents said that they had experienced some form of anti-Semitic =arassment over the 
previous year, while 4 percent said they had experience= physical violence or threats of attack in the same period. 
Almost one-fourth (=3%) said they had been discriminated against in the last 12-month period f=r being Jewish. 
Among employed resp=ndents, 11 percent said they are most likely to experience discrimination =or being Jewish at the 
workplace, while 10 percent said this was the case =hen looking for work. 
The study also exam=ned whether these incidents made it into official statistics. The overwhel=ing majority of 
respondents (82%) said that they had not reported to any a=thority or organization "the most serious incident, namely 
the one that most affected them." 
In Germany, the KPM=, a service for registering crimes, has recorded a decline in anti-Semitic=crimes since 2009. 
However, by itself, that says nothing about the percept=ons of Jews living in Germany. According to the FRA report, 63 
percent of the Jewish respondents in Germany have av=ided "wearing, carrying or displaying things that might help 
people i=entify them as Jews in public," such as a skullcap (kippa). Likewise,=25 percent of them claimed to have 
considered emigrating from Germany in the last five years because they don't feel saf= there. 
When it comes to th= relative seriousness of anti-Semitism, Germany was the only country in wh=ch a majority (61%) of 
respondents said it was the greatest problem. Respo=dents from the other seven countries believed that unemployment 
was the most pressing issue. 
Blamed for Israe=i Policies 
In the report, FRA =tates that a survey it published in 2012 had "found evidence suggesti=g that events in the Middle 
East can act as a trigger for translating anti=lsrael sentiment into antisemitic sentiment targeting Jewish populations as a 
whole." For the poll published Frid=y, 49 percent of respondents in Germany claimed to have heard or seen non-=ewish 
people suggest that Israelis behave "like Nazis" toward th= Palestinians. The study's results seem to suggest that German 
Jews are viewed as proxies of the state of Israel and its poli=ies. Indeed, it found that 81 percent of them have felt 
accused of or blam=d for something the Israeli government had done. Moreover, it noted a clos= coincidence between 
when trouble flares up in the Middle East and when Jews in Germany perceive rising host=lity. 
"One reason (n=t the only one!) for the latent anti-Semitism is the open conflict between=lsrael and Palestine and other 
neighboring Arab countries. A peaceful solu=ion to this conflict would also reduce the ground for anti-Semitism in other 
countries." 
The study also foun= that respondents claimed that they had been increasingly exposed to negat=ve statements about 
Jews online, including on blogs and social-networking =ites. Three-quarters (75%) of all respondents in the eight 
countries identified the Internet as "the most common fo=um for negative statements" and a place where such 
statements could b= made with virtual impunity. This was particularly true for respondents be=ween the ages of 16 and 
29, of whom 88 percent said that they saw or heard negative comments about Jews online. </a
