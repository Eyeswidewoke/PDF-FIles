Fresh Intelligence : Radar Online : Whitewater's Starr Getting Epstein Off? Whitewater A... Page 2 of 7 
His arrest was the result of a 15-month investigation by the Palm Beach police 
department into allegations that he was soliciting high school girls for sexual 
massages. According to a number of the police interviews, the naive young girls 
believed they would be paid only for "massaging an old white guy." But Palm 
Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter developed a disgust for what he believed to 
be preferential treatment given to wealthy Epstein in the investigation and had 
called in the FBI. 
According to police documents, on April 17, 2006, Epstein called in Harvard Law 
professor—and the lawyer who successfully defended Deep Throat actor Harry 
Reems—Alan Dershowitz and powerful attorney Guy Fronstin, who secured 
him a plea bargain. Epstein would plead guilty to one count of aggravated 
assault in exchange for five years probation, a psychiatric evaluation, and no 
unsupervised visits with minors. In all probability, the man once declared one of 
the most eligible bachelors in Manhattan would be labeled a pedophile. 
But three weeks later, according to a May 4 police report, as authorities were 
ready to charge Epstein with four counts of unlawful sexual activity with minors 
and one count of lewd and lascivious molestation, he hired new lawyers, and 
Palm Beach County State Prosecutor Barry Krischer let them renege on 
Epstein's deal, the result of events too perfect to attribute to serendipity. 
(Despite repeated requests, the prosecutors office would not comment for this 
story.) 
Epstein had spoken with Manhattan criminal attorney Gerald Lefcourt to review 
his options. Within days, Lefcourt brought in Palm Beach criminal attorney Jack 
Goldberger who just happened to know state attorney Krischer before he 
became a prosecutor. But not only was Goldberger friendly with the man 
prosecuting Epstein, his partner was married to the assistant sex-crimes 
prosecutor who had been spearheading the Epstein investigation—faced 
suddenly with the glaring conflict, the sex-crimes investigator resigned from the 
case. Epstein's deal was abandoned and a new assistant prosecutor was 
assigned. 
Epstein was so thrilled by Goldberger's work that shortly after he was indicted on 
just a single prostitution charge, he bought the Palm Beach lawyer a black, top-
of-the-line 500 series BMW. Less than six weeks later, Goldberger totaled the 
car in a collision. Makes one wonder what sort of gift would be bestowed upon 
Starr should he score Epstein a get-out-of-jail free card as early as today. A box 
of fine cigars, perhaps?
