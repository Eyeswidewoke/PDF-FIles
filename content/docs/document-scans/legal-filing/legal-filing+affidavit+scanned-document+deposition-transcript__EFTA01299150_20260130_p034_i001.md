314 F. Supp. 442, *; 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11296, ** 
embraced the circle. His backing was cautious, he said. He had traveled the circle and 
parked on the inner circumference a number of times previously. 
Admittedly, Grant never saw or heard the approach of the Honda. There was credible 
evidence that the angular parking on the inner circumference of the circle created a special 
hazard. Particularly when a car was parked in an adjacent space, the vision of the 
"backing" driver was impaired. This was compounded by the circular direction of the 
roadway on which approaching traffic would operate. There was testimony proffered that 
the driver of the Honda should be able to see the backing vehicle before the latter could 
see the motorcycle. 
The duty of a backing driver on a State Road (as this was) is delineated by Florida 
Statutes, 1967, § 317.731, F.S.A. It required that such operation must not be done unless 
it can be made "with safety and without interfering with other traffic." In amplification, this 
driver must exercise every "means at his hand to protect life and property of others that 
may be in his path." Green ["3] v. Atlantic Co., (Fla. 1952), 61 So. 2d 185, 186. In fine, it 
is that operators duty to apprise the approaching vehicle of the contemplated entry and to 
see, and to yield to, any vehicle so near as to constitute a hazard as the backing 
automobile moves into the traveled way. Special hazards to vision only enhance that duty. 
At the close of this non jury trial, I resolved the issue of liability against the defendant 
Grant. Thus, there remains only the issue of damages sought by the injured plaintiff, who 
is now 21, and his mother, who was awarded his custody in earlier divorce proceedings. 
During a substantial part of the time since the injury, Steven has been confined in a state 
institution for convictions of possession of marihuana. 
Steven Walker sustained a compound commuted fracture of the left tibia and fibula. One 
of the two (there are normally three) arteries in the leg was severed. Repair procedures, 
complicated by the absence of the perineal artery, were abortive. Several separate 
hospital confinements totalling 129 days were required. Psychiatric treatment was 
necessary. Osteomalitis developed at the injury site. The leg is now one and one-half 
inches shorter than ["4] the right. Steven limps and complains that the leg hurts 
continuously. His treating physician and surgeon, Dr. Harry B. Orringer, found on April 17, 
1970 a nonunion at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the left tibia. The Court-
appointed physician, Dr. Harry Beller, found that this leg is useless and must be 
amputated below the knee and a prosthesis supplied. This will result in a functional 
extremity for practical purposes. He assigned a 35% permanent partial disability of the 
body as a whole and 90% loss of the left leg. The total medical and related expenses to 
date are $18,128.40. The amputation and prosthesis will cost between $2500 and $3000. 
The injured plaintiff was not living with his mother at the time of the injury. He had moved 
out following an altercation with his step-father. From [*444] the time he was 14 there 
had been bitter disputes with his real father (from whom his mother was subsequently 
divorced) resulting in his exhibiting hostility toward that parent. He manifested personality 
problems and anti-social behavior before the subject accident. 
The plaintiff Steven Walker's greatest need, aside from the leg operation, is motivation. 
["5] He has the mental capacity to develop skills in an occupation which would not 
require full physical capabilities in the left leg. He cannot perform heavy manual labor.
