Bankr. L. Rep. (CCH) P83,176; 64 Bankr. Ct. Dec. 216 
Second-Lien Notes are Senior Indebtedness. The judgment of the district court on that 
issue is, therefore, affirmed. 
p798] B 
As a consequence of rejecting the Plan, the Senior-Lien Notes holders received 
replacement notes which pay out their claim over time. [HN6] The Code permits debtors to 
make such "deferred cash payments" to secured creditors (i.e., to "cramdown"). 11 U.S.C. 
§ 1129(b)(2)(A)(i)(II). However, those payments must ultimately amount to the full value of 
the secured creditors' claims. Id. To ensure the creditor receives the full present value of 
its secured claim, the deferred payments must carry an appropriate rate of interest. See 
Rake v. Wade, 508 U.S. 464, 472 n.8, 113 S. Ct. 2187, 124 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1993). 
The rate selected by the lower courts for the Senior-Lien Note holders' replacement notes 
was based on the "formula" rate. The bankruptcy court selected interest rates of 4.1% and 
4.85%, respectively, which were largely risk-free rates slightly adjusted for appropriate risk 
factors. It is not disputed that this rate is below market [**21] in comparison with rates 
associated with comparable debt obligations. The Debtors defend the application of the 
"formula" method on the ground that it is required by the plurality opinion in the Chapter 13 
case of Till v. SCS Credit Corp., 541 U.S. 465, 124 S. Ct. 1951, 158 L. Ed. 2d 787 (2004). 
The Senior-Lien Notes holders contend that because this rate is too low, the Plan is not 
'fair and equitable" as required by § 1129(b). They argue that the lower courts should have 
applied a market rate of interest which is the rate MPM would pay to a contemporaneous 
sophisticated arms-length lender in the open market. The Senior-Lien Notes holders 
argued in the bankruptcy court that such a market exists and would generate interest in the 
5-6+% range. See 15-1682 JA 464, 1941.' 
7 Debtors' reorganization plan proposed interest rates of 3.6% and 4.09%. See 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 3926. 2014 WL 4436335, at 
'24. However, the bankruptcy court concluded that those rates should be increased by 0.5% and 0.75%. respectively, in light of 
the fact that the base interest rate was pegged to the Treasury rate, rather than the prime rate (which reflects additional risk). 
2014 Bankr. LEXIS 3926. (WL) at '32. On appeal to the district court. the Senior-Lien Notes holders argued the bankruptcy 
court erred in not requiring the prime rate, an argument the district court rejected. 531 B.R. at 334-35. The Senior-Lien Notes 
holders do not press this argument here. 
The bankruptcy court rejected this approach, and concluded that a cramdown interest rate 
should "not take market factors into account." 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 3926, 2014 WL 
4436335, at *25. Viewing itself as "largely governed by the principles enunciated by the 
plurality opinion in Till v. SCS Credit Corp., 541 U.S. 465, 124 S. Ct. 1951, 158 L. Ed. 2d 
787 (2004)," it concluded that the proper rate was what the plurality in Till referred to as 
the "formula" or "prime-plus" rate (discussed more fully below). 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 3926, 
[WL] at *24, *26. The district court agreed. 531 B.R. at 332-34. The Senior-Lien Notes 
holders argue on appeal that the lower courts erred in concluding that the Till plurality 
opinion [**22] is wholly applicable to this Chapter 11 proceeding. In substantial part, we 
agree. 
At issue in Till was a Chapter 13 debtors sub-prime auto loan, carrying an interest rate of 
21% and providing the creditor with a $4,000 secured claim. As with Chapter 11, Chapter 
13 allows debtors to provide secured creditors with future property distributions (such as
