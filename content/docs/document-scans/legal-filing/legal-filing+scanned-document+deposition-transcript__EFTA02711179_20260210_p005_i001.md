Daly Tax Report 
Similarly, a change in accounting method reflecting a change in the characterization can also involve a 
change in the character of taxable income from capital gain (loss) to ordinary income (loss), or vice 
versa. For example, in Witte, the taxpayer's shift from the cost recovery accounting method for gain 
derived from the sale of real estate properties to the completed transaction treatment constituted a 
"change in the accounting method" within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations. While the Witte 
Court found that the change involved the proper timing of a material item, the deficiency 
determination at issue was based on the finding that the amounts reported, as long-term capital gain 
should be taxed as ordinary income since such amounts were in part interest income and income from 
the sale of properly held primarily for sale. Diebold and Pacific Enterprises also involved changes 
between capital and ordinary taxable income. See also Mingo v. Commissioner, T.C.Memo. 2013-149 
(change in accounting method for the proceeds from a partnership interest sale attributable to 
unrealized receivables from the installment method resulting in capital gain to the cash receipts and 
disbursements method yielding ordinary income). 
Divergences from established methods 
A taxpayer is generally required to apply the same accounting method to all instances of a particular 
item. On occasion, however, a taxpayer purports or attempts to report an item using the accounting 
method that it has adopted, established, or elected, but fails to apply the accounting method with 
perfect consistency. As a result, the taxpayer treats the item in two different ways; part of the item is 
reported under the primary accounting method, while the remainder of the item is reported using a 
treatment that diverges from the primary accounting method (divergent treatment). 
When the divergent treatment is discovered by the taxpayer or Field Operations, the issue arises 
whether adjustments to conform the divergent treatment to the primary accounting method should 
be treated as the correction of errors in open tax years or as a change in accounting method under 
IRC §§ 446 and 481. Under current law, we believe that the key to deciding whether an accounting 
method change occurs is whether the divergent treatment is a timing practice that is used on a 
consistent basis. If so, then the divergent treatment is a material item, and conforming the divergent 
treatment to the primary accounting method is a change in the treatment of a material item that 
constitutes an accounting method change. See Treas. Reg. § 1.4461(e)(2)(ii)(a). In contrast, if the 
divergent treatment is not a timing practice and/or is not a consistent practice, it will have a 
permanent impact on lifetime taxable income, and the divergent treatment is an error (or series of 
errors). 
A number of older cases, however, have held that conforming a divergent treatment to the primary 
accounting method is error correction and not an accounting method change, even where the 
divergent treatment was a timing practice that would otherwise qualify as an accounting method 
under IRC § 446, and even where the divergent treatment has been consistently followed over many 
tax years. Examples of these cases (divergent treatment as error cases) include Gimbel Brothers, Inc. 
v. U.S., 535 F.2d 14 (Ct. Cl. 1976) and Standard Oil, 77 T.C. at 381-84. 
In Gimbel Brothers, the taxpayer elected to use the installment method in 1952. The Court concluded 
that this election included both traditional installment sales and revolving credit sales. For many 
years, after the election was made, however, the taxpayer consistently reported only its traditional 
installment sales on the installment method, but reported its revolving credit sales on an accrual 
method. 
The taxpayer in Gimbel Brothers filed amended returns to change its reporting of the revolving credit 
sales to the installment method, characterizing its original treatment of such sales as an error. The 
Internal Revenue Service rejected the amended returns as constituting a retroactive change in 
accounting method made without the requisite consent under IRC § 446(e). The Court, however, 
concluded that taxpayer's use of accrual reporting for revolving credit sales was an error because it 
was inconsistent with its installment method election. The Internal Revenue Service non-acquiesced 
to the Court's decision in AOD 1976-345. See also, Rev. Rul 90-38 and I.R.S. Tech. Adv. Mem. 
200043010 (June 9, 2000). 
Similarly, in Standard Oil, the taxpayer made an election to write off intangible drilling costs (IDCs). 
Thereafter, the taxpayer filed amended returns seeking to deduct as IDCs certain offshore oil platform 
construction costs that it had originally capitalized into the depreciable basis of such platforms. The 
Court concluded that taxpayer's claim of additional deductions on its amended returns constituted "an 
attempt to remedy its failure to report similar items consistently under a fixed method of accounting. 
Such correction of internal inconsistencies does not constitute a change in accounting method." 77 
T.C. at 383. While the Internal Revenue Service did acquiesce to the Court's decision that the drilling 
platforms were properly characterized as IDCs, the Court's reasoning as to the accounting change 
was rejected in I.R.S. Tech. Adv. Mem. 200043010 (June 9, 2000).
