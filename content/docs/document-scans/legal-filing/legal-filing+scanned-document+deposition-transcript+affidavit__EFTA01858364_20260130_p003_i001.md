OSC KW152 1000 Watt 15 Inch 2-Way Active Loudspeaker 
High Output: Like K Series, each of the four KW Series models features a QSC designed, 1000 
watt (2 x 500) Class D power module. And continuing in the K Series tradition, every model is 
fitted with the identical high-output 1.75" I-IF device (full-range models) and woofers of the same 
high quality design, regardless of speaker size. 
Defined Coverage Area: Directivity Matched Transition (DMT) provides for matched LF and HF 
coverage across the entire listening area, eliminating unnatural "dead" or "hot" frequency zones. 
DSP: Extensive signal processing is employed throughout, providing levels of sonic clarity and total 
output that defy all expectations for a product in this category: 
Intrinsic Correction, first featured in our high-end line array products maps 65-75 spatially 
averaged measurements to HR and FIR filters that actively adjust time, frequency and amplitude 
response to a maximally flat bandpass target. The result is a speaker that behaves equally well 
across the entire sound field. 
DEEP and excursion limiting allow for extended low-frequency response by actively managing low-
frequency transients without degradation of the underlying signal or adjacent frequencies. 
GuardRail protection, first introduced on our GX Series amplifiers protects both the amplifier 
module and your performance from unnatural and destructive clipping. 
Connectivity: KW Series features a four-position mic / line gain switch that allows for connection 
of a wide variety of devices. Combo XLR and 1/4" TRS inputs accept both mic and line level input 
while a set of RCA phono inputs (except KW181) allow additional connectivity to portable MP3 
players, CD players and line-level mixers. Up to three audio sources can be mixed internally and 
summed to a balanced output for "daisy-chaining" of multiple units. Separate direct outputs are 
also provided on each channel for additional output flexibility. 
Control: On-board switches provide preset EQ settings. The HF setting (full-range models) can be 
set to VOCAL BOOST for additional presence in the critical mid-frequency area or FLAT for accurate 
reproduction of the incoming signal. The LF switch can be set to NORM, DEEP." for additional bass 
extension, or EXT SUB (full-range models) for use with an external subwoofer. The rear panel LED 
switch can be set to POWER, illuminating the front-mounted LED when the unit is powered on, OFF 
for applications where it is not desirable to illuminate the front LED, or LIMIT which indicates to the 
system operator that the clip limiter circuit has been engaged during operation. 
Tilt-Direct: The KW122 and KW152 feature a unique Tilt-Direct pole cup mounting system. A 
simple turn of the dial engages a 7.5 degree downward tilt of the speaker allowing acoustic energy 
to be kept on the audience and off reflective surfaces for applications where maximum coverage 
from a high-positioned speaker is desired. 
Remote Gain: Remote gain control capability is offered via a potentiometer (not included) 
connected to the on-board Phoenix-Style connector. In an installed application, multiple KW Series 
speakers can be "daisy-chained" for total gain control from a single remote pot. Auto-standby 
mode is engaged after 5 minutes of Inactivity. 
Premium-grade materials: KW Series is designed to withstand the rigors of professional use. 
Advanced construction processes, premium-grade Baltic birch cabinetry, ergonomic, cast 
aluminum handles, low-noise casters (KW181) and a highly protective steel grille provide for ease 
of transport and long term durability. Integrated M10 suspension points allow for flown applications 
with a KW M10 KIT (sold separately) and a threaded pole receptacle (KW181) provides for a
