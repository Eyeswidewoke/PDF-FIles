2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common 
to the Class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the 
claims or defenses of the Class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and 
adequately protect the interests of the Class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Rule 23(b)(3), under 
which Plaintiffs seek class certification, additionally requires that "questions of law or fact 
common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual 
members, and that (16] a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and 
efficiently adjudicating the controversy." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). 
Plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that Rule 23's requirements are met by a 
preponderance of the evidence, and the Court "must make whatever factual and legal 
inquiries are necessary and must consider all relevant evidence and arguments presented 
by the parties." In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 306 (3d Cir. 2008). 
1. Numerosity 
Rule 23(a)(1) requires that it be impracticable to join all class members, but there is "no 
minimum number of members needed for a suit to proceed as a class action." Marcus v. 
BMW of N. Am., LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 595 (3d Cir. 2012). Though Rule 23(a)(1) "requires 
examination of the specific facts of each case," the numerosity requirement is generally 
met "if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds 40." 
Id. (citations omitted). Here CAA identified 186,031 N14 Class members representing 
80,224 N14 Class Vehicles. ECF No. 92-4. ¶ 4. The Court finds that the numerosity 
requirement is satisfied. 
2. Commonality 
Under Rule 23(a)(2), the Named Plaintiffs must "share at least one question of law or fact 
with the grievances of the prospective class." Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 227 (3d 
Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). Class claims "must depend upon a common contention . . . 
of such a nature that it is capable of classwide [*17] resolution -- which means that 
determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each 
one of the claims in one stroke." Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 131 S. Ct. 
2541, 2551, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011). The commonality requirement is met here. 
Because, as Plaintiffs represented when seeking preliminary approval of the settlement, 
"[ajll Class Vehicles had the allegedly defective timing chain tensioner installed," P. Mot. 
Preliminary Approval, ECF No. 70 at 21, "the claims of the Class Representatives and the 
Settlement Class are predicated on the core common issue as to whether Defendants are 
liable for the damages suffered" by Class members as a result of the defective part. Id. 
3. Typicality 
Under Rule 23(a)(3), the Named Plaintiffs' claims must be "typical of the claims or 
defenses of the class." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). 'The typical inquiry is intended to assess . 
. . whether the named plaintiffs have incentives that align with those of absent class 
members so as to assure that the absentees' interests will be fairly represented." Baby 
Neal for & by Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 57-58 (3d Cir. 1994). "This investigation 
properly focuses on the similarity of the legal theory and legal claims; the similarity of the
