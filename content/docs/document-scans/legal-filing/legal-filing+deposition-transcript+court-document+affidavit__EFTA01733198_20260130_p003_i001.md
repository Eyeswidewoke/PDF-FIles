The following is a longer excerpt of Rajoub's statements a=vocating the teaching of a murderer's "will" in PA 
schools:<=div> 
Deputy Secretary of the Fat=h Central Committee and Head of the Supreme Council for Sport and Youth Af=airs, Jibril 
Rajoub: "Clearly these are individual o=erations (i.e., terror attacks), however, they comprise bravery and compos=re. 
They contain a range of values that obligate the political elite and p=litical and national Palestinian powers to see the will 
of that hero who w=ote a blog. It can be a document they could teach in schools, on the meani=g of Martyrdom-death" 
PAT= host: "Fadi Alloun (i.e., terrorist who stabbed one)." 
Rajoub: "- and the meaning of=patriotism... This is the Palestinian behavior in the field that comprises=a high willingness 
to sacrifice. You see [an Israeli] soldier with a rifle=fleeing [a Palestinian] with a knife or even one with nothing, or [an 
Isra=li] scared in front of a Palestinian, only because he is Palestinian... Th=se are individual acts of bravery, and I am 
proud of them. I congratulate =veryone who carried them out. I say to you, we are proud of you... Whoever=confronts, 
fights, dies as a Martyr, is arrested or injured - his identity=is known. What I mean is that the fighter, the prisoner, or the 
Martyr, thy are assets to the entire Palestinian people... The international communi=y does not agree to a bus 
exploding in Tel Aviv. But the international com=unity does not ask what happens to a settler or soldier in the occupied 
te=ritories at the wrong time and in the wrong place. No one asks about him! =herefore, we want to fight in such a way 
that the world and the internatio=al community will remain by our side." 
(Official PA TV, Oc=. 17, 2015] 
Rajoub's referral to "the will of that hero," that he thinks shoul= be taught in PA schools, possibly refers to terrorist Baha 
Alyan who carr=ed out a shooting and stabbing attack on bus 78 in Jerusalem, killing 3. B=fore his attack, Alyan wrote 
"10 commandments of every Martyr" on his Face=ook page: 
"1. I instruct the factions not to take r=sponsibility for my Martyrdom-death, for my death was for the homeland 
and=not for you. 
2. I do not want any posters or T-shirts,=as my memory will not only be a poster hanging on the walls. 
</=iv> 
3. I instruct you not to exhaust my mothe= with questions meant to win over the sentiments of the spectators and 
not=ing more. 
4. Do not sow hatred in my son's heart. L=t him discover his homeland and die for his homeland, and not in order to 
=venge my death. 
5. If they [Israel] wish to demolish my h=me, let them do so, since the stone is not more precious than the soul cre=ted 
by my God. 
6. Do not grieve over my Martyrdom-death,=grieve over what will happen to you after I am gone. 
7. Do not look for what I had written bef=re my Martyrdom-death, look for what is the reason behind my Martyrdom-
dea=h. 
8. Do not cry out in my funeral processio= or push each other, but be only pure during the funeral prayer, nothing m=re. 
9. Do not turn me into another number you=count today and forget tomorrow. 
10. I will see you in Paradise."
