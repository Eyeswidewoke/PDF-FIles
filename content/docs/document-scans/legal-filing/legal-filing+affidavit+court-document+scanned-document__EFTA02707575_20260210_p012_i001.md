Revenue Recognition — The recognition of revenues meets the following criteria: the existence of an 
arrangement through an enrollment agreement, the rendering of child care and tutoring services, an age-
specific tuition rate and/or fees, and probable collection. Tuition, fees, and other income are recognized 
as the related services arc provided. Payments for these types of services may be received in advance of 
services being rendered, in which case the revenue is deferred and recognized over the appropriate 
service period. Deferred revenue for nonrefundable registration fees is recognized over the average 
enrollment period, not to exceed 12 months. 
The Company's primary source of revenue is tuition paid by parents and supplemented, in some cases, 
by employer sponsors and government agencies. Revenues also include management fees paid by 
employer sponsors. In addition to tuition revenue and management fees, the Company receives fees for 
registration and other ancillary services. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents include interest-earning securities that 
mature within three months or less from the date purchased. 
Restricted Cash — At December 31, 2011 and 2010, restricted cash of $16.0 million and $25.9 million, 
respectively, is included within other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Restricted 
cash of S7.7 million and $17.4 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is related to debt 
service requirements for properties sold that are held as collateral under the collateralized mortgaged-
backed security (CMBS) facility; consisting of a $650.0 million mortgage loan and $50.0 million senior 
mezzanine loan (see Note 12). Restricted cash of $8.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, is held as 
collateral on the Company's foreign currency hedge (see Note 14). 
Concentration of Credit Risk — Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist 
primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. Cash and cash equivalents are placed with 
high-credit-quality financial institutions. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is 
generally diversified due to the large customer base and its geographic dispersion. The Company 
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. 
Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable are composed primarily of tuition and reimbursable 
expenses due from government agencies, parents, and employers. Accounts receivable arc presented at 
estimated net realizable value. The Company uses estimates in determining the ability to collect 
accounts receivable and must rely on its evaluation of historical experience, specific customer issues, 
governmental funding ►evels, and current economic trends to arrive at appropriate reserves. 
Investments — The Company classifies investments in debt and equity securities as trading, held to 
maturity, or available for sale in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 320-10, 
Investments — Debt and Equity. 
Available-for-sale securities include debt and equity securities, which the Company records at fair value, 
with unrealized gains and losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income in the 
consolidated balance sheets. Trading securities include investments in short-term corporate debt 
securities. Unrealized gains and losses on these short-term marketable securities are included in 
nonoperating income in the consolidated statements of operations.
