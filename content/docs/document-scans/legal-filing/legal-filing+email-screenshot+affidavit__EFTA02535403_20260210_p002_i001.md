Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr.=Ferguson's questions. Nor do any of the top executives at 
Goldman=Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are, at least from=the perspective of the filmmaker, 
friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the=director's comprehensive critique of the way business has been do=e in the 
United States and the other advanced capitalist countries for th= past two decades. 
Both American political parties are indicted; "Inside Job"=is not simply another belated settling of accounts with Mr. 
Bush and his=advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government=oversight and the weakening of 
checks on speculative activity by banks be=an under Reagan and continued during the Clinton administration. And 
with=each administration the market in derivatives expanded, and alarms about=the dangers of this type of investment 
were ignored. Raghuram Rajan, chie= economist at the International Monetary Fund, presented a paper in 
2005=warning of a "catastrophic meltdown" and was mocked as a="Luddite" by Mr. Summers. 
Meanwhile, some investment bankers — at Goldman Sachs in particula= — were betting against the positions they were 
pushing on their=customers. An elaborate house of cards had been constructed in which bad=consumer loans were 
bundled into securities, which, were certified as sou=d by rating agencies paid by the banks and then insured via credit-
defaul= swaps. One risky bet was stacked on top of another, and in retrospect th= collapse of the whole edifice, along 
with the loss of jobs, homes, pensi=ns and political confidence, seems inevitable. 
How did this happen? Mr. Ferguson is no conspiracy theorist; nor is he incrined toward structural or systemic 
explanations. Markets are not like tec=onic plates, shifting on their own. Visible hands write laws and make dea=s, and 
in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems=to have driven very intelligent men (and they were 
mostly men) toward fol=y. In addition to business and government, Mr. Ferguson aims his critique=at academia, 
suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a=few prominent economists were corrupted by consulting 
fees, seats on boar=s of directors and membership in the masters of the universe club. 
When he challenges some of these professors, in particular those who held=positions of responsibility in the White 
House or in the Federal Reserve,=they are reduced to stammering obfuscation — Markets are complica=ed! Who could 
have predicted? I don't see any conflict of interes= — and occasionally provoked to testiness. Mr. Ferguson, for his=part, 
cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm. Occas=onally his voice pipes up from off camera, saying 
things like, "Y=u can't be serious!" 
But it is hard to imagine a movie more serious, and more urgent, than =80 Inside Job." There are a few avenues that 
might have been ex=lored more thoroughly, in particular the effects of the crisis on ordinar=, non-Wall-Street-connected 
workers and homeowners. The end of the film=raises a disturbing question, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand 
chan=es in the status quo so that the trends associated with unchecked specula=ion of the kind that caused the last 
crisis — rising inequality,=neglect of productive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust —=might be reversed. 
This call to arms makes you wonder why anger of the kind so eloquently exp=essed in "Inside Job" has been so inchoate. 
And through=no fault of its own, the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged= Its fate is likely to be that of other 
documentaries: praised in some qu=rters, nitpicked in others and shrugged off by those who need its message=most. 
Which is a shame. 
"Inside Job" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).=Some drug and sex references and pervasive obscenity, though 
not the verb=l kind.
