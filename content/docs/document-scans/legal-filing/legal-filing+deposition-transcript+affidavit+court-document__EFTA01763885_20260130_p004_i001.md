October 26, 2012 -- The Iranians and their Hiz=ullah ally are sending warning signals about how they might fight a future 
war with the United States and Israel. The s=gnals aren't subtle—Tehran intends to retaliate for any attack on its nuclea= 
facilities <http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/22/israel-s=top-iran-expert-you-can-t-out-negotiate-the-
mullahs.html> with blows against America's allies in the region, hitting their most se=sitive oil and nuclear facilities. 
A P=Iestinian man listens to a speech by Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrall=h on Hizbullah's Al-Manar TV, Oct. 11, 
2012. Hassan Nasrallah claimed Thursday responsibility for sending a drone which="flew over important installations" in 
Israel on Oct. 6 and was =owned over the northern part of the Negev desert. (Wissam Nassar, Xinhua /=Landov) 
=/a>The U.S a=d Iran have been adversaries since 1979; we fought an undecla=ed naval war in the late 1980s 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/06/the-last=time-we-fought-iran.html> . The American presidential 
election has seen both candidates threaten Iran rith military action if it does not forsake development of a nuclear 
arsena= and halt its nuclear enrichment program. Iran has long threatened it will=retaliate dramatically and decisively if 
it is attacked by the U.S., Israel or both. Now it is showing some of i=s plans for doing just that. 
On Aug. 15, a cyberattack hit Saudi oil giant Aramco w=th devastating results. According to U.S. Secretary of Defense 
Leon Panetta, 30,000 computer workstations were rendered useles= and had to be replaced. Aramco, which Forbes 
magazine ranks as the world=92s largest oil company and is the key to Saudi Arabia's production, had=data on many of 
its hard drives erased and replaced with photos of a burning U.S. flag. Panetta did not directly =ccuse Iran of 
responsibility, but other U.S. officials have pointed right =t Tehran. Panetta concluded that Iran has "undertaken a 
concerted effort=to use cyberspace to its advantage." 
=/a>A few day= later in Qatar, a similar virus attacked the RasGas natural-gas company, = joint venture between Exxon 
Mobil and the state-owned Qatar Petroleum, which operates the world's largest natural-=as field. According to Panetta, 
the two attacks were "probably the most =estructive attack the private sector has seen to date." Neither attack d=rectly 
targeted the sensitive Aramco and RasGas computer systems that operate the oil industry itself—the att=cks were more 
aimed at its management systems. 
=/a>The timin= was significant. The attack was launched on the eve of the Islamic holy =93night of power," or Lailat al 
Qadr, which commemorates when the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by =he angel Gabriel. Shia 
Muslims believe it also coincides with the date on =hich Ali, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, was fatally wounded 
by a poi=on-coated sword in Iraq. The Saudi and Qatari governments would understand the message clearly; Iran can 
atta=k your economy. In effect: we don't need to shut the Strait of Hormuz, w= will shut down your computer instead. 
=/a>At least =he Saudi attack was an inside job. According to The New York Times, a comp=ny insider or insiders 
probably inserted a memory stick that contained the virus. Aramco has almost 60,000 employee=, about 70 percent of 
which are Shia Muslims from the kingdom's Eastern =rovince along the Persian Gulf, and where almost all of Saudi 
Arabia's o=l is found. The Saudi Shia community has been in a state of growing unrest since the start of the Arab 
Awakenin= in 2011. There have been increasingly violent protests against the House =f Saud in the Shia community, 
which has long faced discrimination by the S=udis. Since Saudi troops crossed the King Fand Causeway last year to 
suppress demonstrations in neighboring=Bahrain by the Shia majority there, anger at the Saudi royal family has be=ome 
even more pronounced among Shia in Eastern Province. Aramco, in short,=is a target-rich environment for angry Saudi 
Shia with ties to Iran. Only a tiny minority would need to see= Iranian technical help to penetrate the digital heart of the 
kingdom's =il industry. 
=/a>The Saudi=Ministry of Interior has long been obsessed with Iranian intelligence acti=ity among the Shia minority. 
The ministry has always believed a Shia terror group with links to Iran was responsible=for the 1996 attack on the U.S. 
air base in Khobar that killed 19 U.S. ser=icemen and wounded 372 Americans, Saudis, and other nationalities. The 
Kho=ar Towers are located close to Aramco headquarters in Dhahran.
