Sound". Recordings made prior to 1966 such as "My Girl", were built around songs with simple, direct 
lyrics supported by an R&B rhythm section with orchestral strings and horns added for pop appeal. 
During this period, each recording usually featured only one lead singer, usually David Ruffin or Eddie 
Kendricks, although Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Otis Williams each had solo numbers of their 
own at various times during this period. 
Melisma and other complicated vocalization techniques featured in the arrangements of most other 
Motown groups of the period were essentially eschewed by the Temptations for a more direct, yet 
obviously gospel-rooted vocal approach, in order to make the songs more palatable for white audiences. 
Creative control remained primarily in the hands of Smokey Robinson, although individual members of 
the Temptations periodically co-wrote some of their own songs, most frequently by Eddie Kendricks, 
who also handled the vocal arrangements for all of the Temptations' material. 
In 1966, Norman Whitfield changed the group's dynamic, moving them away from the previous one lead 
singer model and adding elements derived from the rougher soul of artists such as James Brown, Wilson 
Pickett, and the performers at Stax Records. Whitfield and his lyricists crafted Temptations songs with 
shifts of dynamics, syncopated horn stabs, and more intricate harmony arrangements which spotlighted 
each singer's unique vocal range. Onstage, this change was reflected in the group's use of a custom-
made four-headed microphone stand, invented by David Ruffin, which allowed each member freedom 
to perform without having to all crowd around one or two microphones. Under Whitfield's control, the 
Temptations retained their white pop appeal, but also gained popularity amongst black audiences as 
well. 
Psychedelic and cinematic soul (1968-1973) 
When David Ruffin was replaced by Dennis Edwards, and Sly and the Family Stone became popular, 
Whitfield again restructured the Temptations' sound, this time driving the group almost completely into 
a "psychedelic soul" type sound. However, ballads in the traditional style of the group were still being 
recorded as B-sides and album fillers, with the lone exception being "Just My Imagination". 
Most other recordings from this period in 1968-1970 such as "Cloud Nine" and "Psychedelic Shack" 
featured echoed vocal tracks, distorted guitar lines with prominent use of the wah-wah pedal, hard-
hitting drums, and various stereo and other sound effects. The majority of these songs feature at least 
two lead singers and often, all five Temptations sang lead, trading bars A la the Family Stone. Dennis 
Edwards, whose vocal style had a rougher, more Southern-soul based sound than that of David Ruffin, 
was often featured prominently on most of these recordings. 
Inspired heavily by the concurrent works of Sly Stone, the lyrics for these songs centered primarily 
around then-current social issues such as integration, the Vietnam War, and self-consciousness. In 
addition, in an attempt to get the social message contained therein across to their audiences more 
clearly, many of the psychedelic soul recordings of this period were presented in mixes of extended 
length, often up to twice, triple or quadruple the length of the typical three-minute Motown song.
