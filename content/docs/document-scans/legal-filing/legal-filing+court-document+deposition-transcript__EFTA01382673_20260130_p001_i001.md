Key Trends 
Our industry is impacted by several significant trends that are driving growth and changing the way commerce is being conducted and 
facilitated around the world. 
These trends include: 
• 
Shift to Electronic Commerce - Conthmers, businesses, financial institutions, and government entities around the world are continuing 
to shift their commercial activities and transactions to electronic forms. According to The Nilson Report dated December 2014, in the 
United States from 2013 to 2018. cash and check purchase volumes are projected to decline by 34% and 46%. rethectively, while credit 
and debit card purchase volumes are projected to increase by 65% and 49%. respectively.

Migration to Online Channels — Over the past 20 years. the combination of the growth of the Internet. the decreasing costs of 
technology used to access the Internet. and the increasing adoption of electronic payments has driven the migration of commerce to 
online channels such as eCominerce and mobile commerce. We believe this migration will continue as market demographics shift to 
newer generations of consumers who use the Internet and mobile anaaphones more heavily. According to the eMarketer Report, global 
eCommeree spending as a percentage of global retail spending is projected to increase from 6% in 2013 to 9% in 2018. 
Clobaltzation of Commerce — Commerce is evolving from a primarily local or regional activity to a multi-national or global activity 
due to several factors, including: (1) population growth rates and changes in socio-economic demographics in developing markets are 
creating large addressable markets for commerce: (2) large businesses and financial institutions arc expanding across geographic 
borders as they sock to grow their own operations or serve customers who are expanding internationally; and (3) businesses of all sizes 
arc conducting more commerce on the Internet, where online customers are not constrained by geographic distance. According to The 
Nilson Report dated January 2015, from 2013 to 2023. the percentage of global purchase transactions conducted in the United States 
and Canada will decline from 48% to 38%, while the percentage of transactions conducted in Asia and Latin America will increase 
from 27% to 38%. and the percentage of transactions conducted in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region will remain relatively flat. 
moving from 25% to 24%.

become more accessible to consumers and smaller enterprises. The costs of traditional technology products and services, such as 
computer hardware, enterprise software, and telecommunications have decline) materially, while Internet access speeds and the
