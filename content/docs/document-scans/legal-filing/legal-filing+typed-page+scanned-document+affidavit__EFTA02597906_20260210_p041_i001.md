Transmittal at an address other than that shown above, the appropriate boxes on this Letter of Transmittal should be 
completed. 
10. Federal Income Tax Withholding. Under the federal income tax laws, the Depositary will be required to withhold 31% 
of the amount of any payments m=de to certain stockholders pursuant to the Offer. In order to avoid such backu= 
withholding, each tendering stockholder must provide the Depositary with su=h stockholder's correct taxpayer 
identification number by completing the Substitute Form W-9 set forth above. In general, if a stockholder is an 
individual, the taxpayer identification number is the social security numbe= of such individual. If the Depositary is not 
provided with the correct taxpayer identification number, the stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by 
the Internal Revenue Service and payments that are made =o such stockholder pursuant to the Offer may be subject to 
backup withholding= Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals) are 
not subject to these backup withholding and report=ng requirements. In order to satisfy the Depositary that a foreign 
individual qualifies as an exempt recipient, such stockholder must submit an IRS Form =- 8, signed under penalties of 
perjury, attesting to that individual's ex=mpt status. Such statements can be obtained from the Depositary. For further 
information concerning backup withholding and instructions for completing t=e Substitute Form W-9 (including how to 
obtain a taxpayer identification numb=r if you do not have one and how to complete the Substitute Form W-9 if Share= 
are held in more than one name), consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on 
Substitute Form W-9. 
Failure to complete the Substitute Form W-9 will not, by itself, cause Shares to be deemed invalidly tendered, but may 
require the Depositary to withhold 31% of the amount of any payments made pursuant to the Offer. Back=p withholding 
is not an additional federal income tax. Rather, the federal income tax liability of a person subject to backup withholding 
will be redu=ed by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be 
obtained. 
NOTE: FAILURE TO COMPLETE AND RETURN THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 MAY RESULT IN BACKUP WITHHOLDING OF 
31% OF ANY PAYMENTS MADE TO YOU PURSUANT TO THE OFFER= PLEASE REVIEW THE ENCLOSED GUIDELINES FOR 
CERTIFICATION OF TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ON SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. 
Unless the Company determines that a reduced rate of withholding is applicable pursuant to a tax treaty or that an 
exemption from withholding i= applicable because gross proceeds paid pursuant to the Offer are effectivel= connected 
with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, the Company will be required to withhold federal 
income tax at a rate of 30= from such gross proceeds paid to a foreign stockholder or his agent. For th=s purpose, a 
foreign stockholder is any stockholder that is not (i) a citizen=or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, 
partnership or other ent=ty created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, or (iii) an= estate or trust the 
income of which is subject to United States federal inc=me taxation regardless of its source. The Company will 
determine the applicabl= rate of withholding by reference to a stockholder's address, except if =acts and circumstances 
indicate such reliance is not warranted or if applicable =aw 
(for example, an applicable tax treaty or Treasury regulations thereunder) 
requires some other method for determining a stockholder's residence. A foreign stockholder may be eligible to file for a 
refund of such tax or a portion of such tax if such stockholder meets the "complete redemption=quot, "substantially 
disproportionate" or "not essentially equival=nt to a dividend" tests described in the Offer to Purchase under the 
caption "The Offer-=13. Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences" or if such stockholder is ent=tled to a reduced rate 
of withholding pursuant to a treaty and the Company withheld=at a higher rate. In order to claim an exemption from 
withholding on the groun=s that gross proceeds paid pursuant to the Offer are effectively connected wi=h the conduct 
of a trade or business within the United States, a foreign stockholder must deliver to the Depositary a properly executed 
Form 4224 claiming exemption. Such Forms can be obtained from the Information Agent. Foreign stockholders are 
urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding =he application of federal income tax withholding, including eligibility 
for a withholding tax reduction or exemption and the refund procedure.
