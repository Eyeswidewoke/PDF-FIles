History of Academic Medicine 
Moving a step further, the Scientific 
Advisory Committee proposed in 1956 to 
create a "two-year program for people 
who have their MI) degree and intend to 
go into medical research as a career."" 
The NIH created a new category of 
research associates to designate the 
physicians in this program as fully 
committed to research activities, in 
contrast with the clinical associates who 
also had medical staff duties at the 
Clinical Center. In designing the 
program, the committee members 
studied other institution? curricula—
especially that of the Rockefeller Institute 
for Medical Research, which had started 
accepting graduate students in 1953—
and looked into Harvard Medical 
School's effort to avoid too intensive and 
too early specialization in training for 
first-year medical students. They also 
reviewed the nation's workforce for 
medical research—one of the NIH 
leadership's major concerns since the late 
1940s—and considered the possibility of 
designating medical research as a medical 
specialty." 
The goal of the research associate 
program was to turn physicians into 
independent medical investigators who 
were well grounded in modern scientific 
knowledge and methods. The committee 
members felt strongly that research 
associates should "learn how to do 
research more than to do research itself" 
and that they should be brought into 
close contact with accomplished scientists 
in specialized research fields. In 
particular, the committee stressed two 
points: "The importance of having the 
Research Associatels) work on problems 
of their! own choice rather than be 
'servants' in the research problems of the 
preceptor, and the importance of 
providing the students! with some 
integrated and organized basic knowledge 
as a foundation that would permit them 
to do their own integrating of knowledge 
later."24 Therefore, in their first year, 
research associates attended one- to two-
hour formal lectures three days each week 
(on the basic medical sciences, organic 
chemistry, physical chemistry, tracer 
methods, and so on). In their second 
year, they participated in a weekly, two-
hour informal seminar and a weekly 
evening conference. The rest of their time 
was spent in a laboratory with a 
preceptor. Clinical associates benefited 
from the program as well; they were 
allowed to attend any of the lectures and 
seminars they wished. 
A separate third category, the staff 
associate, was created in 1964 with the 
goal of training highly qualified 
candidates to fill openings in various NIH 
programs. 
By that time, the NIH ATP was 
recognized as the place to get thorough 
training in biomedical research in the 
United States. "It was very difficult lat 
other institutions! to give people very 
meaningful clinical and research 
opportunities," recalled Samuel Broder." 
an NIH associate who entered the ATP in 
1972 and subsequently rose through the 
ranks to become director of the National 
Cancer Institute. "Particularly in some 
fields where the NIH virtually was the 
only place in town, the only place in the 
world, perhaps, that could do certain 
types of training programs."

training they received through the ATP. 
Of the 2.791 associates who graduated 
from U.S. medical schools between 1955 
and 1973, we identified 1,577 (56.6%) 
who later entered academic medicine, 
according to the AAMC Faculty Roster 
database. We identified a total of 27,821 
nonassociates—namely, all other 
physicians in the Faculty Roster database 
who graduated during the same period—
who likewise entered academic 
medicine during their careers. We 
found that a greater proportion of 
associates achieved higher academic 
positions compared with nonassociates 
(Figure 2). Faculty members who were 
NIH associates were about one-and-a-
half times more likely to achieve the 
position of full professor (ratio 1.57; 
95% confidence interval ICI) 1.49-
1.66), twice as likely to achieve the 
position of chair (ratio 2.0; 95% CI 
1.78-2.24), and nearly three times as 
likely to achieve the position of dean 
(ratio 2.97; 95% CI 2.21-3.98). These 
results were not substantially different 
after excluding women from the 
associates (n = 4) and nonassociates 
(n = 2,939).
