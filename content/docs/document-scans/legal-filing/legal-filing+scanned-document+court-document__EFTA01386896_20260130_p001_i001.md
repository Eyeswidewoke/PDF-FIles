turn adversely affect the Issuer and the investors in the Preferred Shares and (iii) none of the Transaction Parties or their 
respective affiliates, corporate officers or professional advisors or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or 
guarantee that the Portfolio Advisor or its affiliates or the transaction contemplated by this Offering Memorandum will be in 
compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Regulations. 
Each prospective investor should consult its own legal, accounting and other advisors to determine whether and to what 
extent this information is sufficient for its purposes and any other requirements of which it is uncertain. For important 
information about the U.S. Risk Retention Regulations, see information under Section 12, "Certain Risk Factors—Risks 
Relating to the Preferred Shares—U.S. Risk Retention Regulations." 
CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS 
ERISA imposes certain requirements on "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title I of 
ERISA, on entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets 
of such plans (collectively, "ERISA Plans") and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. 
Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment 
prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan's investments be made in accordance with the 
documents governing the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible 
fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan's particular circumstances and all of the facts and 
circumstances of the investment and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to 
sell or otherwise dispose of any Preferred Shares it may purchase. 
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as 
well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, such as individual 
retirement accounts and Keogh plans, including entities whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans 
(collectively, together with ERISA Plans, "Plans")) and certain persons (referred to as "Parties in Interesr or "Disqualified 
Persons") having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the 
transaction (each, a "prohibited transaction"). A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited 
transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the 
fiduciary of the Plan that is engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties under ERISA 
and the Code. 
The Co-Issuers, the Security Party and the Portfolio Advisor and any of their respective affiliates (each, a "Transaction 
Party") may be parties in interest and disqualified persons with respect to many Plans. Prohibited transactions within the 
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if Preferred Shares are acquired or held by a Plan 
with respect to which any Transaction Party is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the 
prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, in 
certain cases, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Preferred Shares and the 
circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and 
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions with certain service providers) and Prohibited Transaction Class 
Exemption ("PTCE") 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to 
transactions effected by independent "qualified professional asset managers"), PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions 
involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate 
accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by certain "in-house asset managers"). There can be no 
assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction 
involving Preferred Shares. 
Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), non-U.S. plans (as defined in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) and
