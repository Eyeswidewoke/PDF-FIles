> [ii] The faculty of language FL appears to be a true species property: =hared among human groups (with limited 
individual differences) and in =11 essential respects, unique to humans. In particular, there is no =eaningful evidence for 
existence of language prior to AMH. 
> [iii] Recent genomic studies indicate that some human groups (San =eople) separated from other humans about 
150kya. As far as we know, =hey share FL with other human groups. 
> [iv] The San languages are all and only those that have the curious =roperty of phonetic clicks, and there may be some 
articulatory =daptation to producing them (See Huijbregts, forthcoming). 
Nguni languages have clicks, too, but they seem to have imported them =rom Khoisan. 
> [v] The first (very limited) indication of some form of symbolic =ehavior appears at about 75kya. Not long after that, 
we have rich =vidence of quite extraordinary creative achievements (Lascaux, etc.). 
This is consistent with another observation: Modern humans had a =opulation bottleneck of 2000-3000 individuals ca 
75000 years ago, which =oincides with the Tonga eruption. This does not necessarily mean that =he volcano killed off 
almost all hominids, but it increased the =volutionary pressure, and it is possible that our ancestors evolved a =utation 
that enabled them to outcompete and kill most of the hominid =ompetition (including Neanderthals). What if that 
mutation is something =hat roughly translates into "symbolic behavior"? 
I currently think that much of our civilization might be the result of a series of quite specific mutations. Our ancestors 
went from 3000 =ndividuals to one million and remained there until they developed =eligions. Religion and other 
ideologies are based on a need for =onformance to internalized norms, i.e. an innate desire to serve as =art of a system 
that is larger than the individual's reputation based =roup. They were also based on a shared conceptual space. 
Challenge 1 seems mostly to amount to: verify that 1. all human groups =ave language, and 2. there is no grammatical 
non-human language. One of =he interesting questions might be if dolphins have grammatical =anguage, another one 
concerns the limits of learning in non-human =rimates. The challenge is completely empirical. 
Challenge 2 seems very exciting to me; I read it as: has language =ntrinsically linear order, or is that only imposed by the 
=equentialization of articulation? Grammatical language has a tree =tructure, and the tree seems to be created 
probabilistically in the =istener, from a string of discrete symbols. Would natural language be =earnable without the 
constraints of sequentiality and discreteness? 
Challenge 3: do we need externalization to learn and process language? I =ould suspect that an individual can play a 
language game against itself =ntil it converges on its own language, but it is not clear that humans =re among the class 
of individuals that can do that from scratch. Most =esearch suggests that there is a critical window in which we must 
pick =p our first language for perfect fluency, and there seems to be no =vidence of entirely individualistic 
acquisition/formation of a first =anguage. If that is true, is that a constraint of the way language =earning is 
implemented in the human brain, or a complexity constraint =ithin language itself? 
It seems to be clear that learning a programming language changes the =ay we think, i.e. it provides evidence for a weak 
version of the Sapir =horf hypothesis. But that is not so much a constraint of =xternalization, but of the semantic 
structures addressed by the =anguage. 
I imagine that pure work in a computer science lab can make some =nteresting progress on challenges 2 and 3. 
Challenge 4: I don't understand enough about the context to see =he significance yet; I would think that once we have 
an SMT model of =anguage formation, we can learn additional operations that perform =perations on the generated
