RIN II •094 Alpha Group Capital LLC 
PRIIPS Regulation / Prohibition on Sales to EEA Retail Investors 
The Preferred Shares are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or 
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). For these purposes, a retail 
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 
2014/65/EU (as amended, "MiFID II"); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the 
Insurance Mediation Directive" ), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of 
Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as 
amended, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Refinancing Securities or otherwise making them available to 
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Refinancing Securities or otherwise 
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. 
MiFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market 
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the 
Preferred Shares has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Preferred Shares is eligible counterparties and 
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Preferred Shares to eligible 
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the 
Preferred Shares (a "distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however, a 
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Preferred 
Shares (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate 
distribution channels. 
No invitation may be made to the public in the Cayman Islands to subscribe for the Preferred Shares. 
PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD REVIEW THE NOTICES BELOW FOR CERTAIN INFORMATION RELATING TO 
OFFERS AND SALES OF PREFERRED SHARES IN THE ISSUER TO INVESTORS IN VARIOUS STATES OF THE 
UNITED STATES.

Transferred except in a transaction which is exempt under such act or pursuant to an effective registration under such act.
