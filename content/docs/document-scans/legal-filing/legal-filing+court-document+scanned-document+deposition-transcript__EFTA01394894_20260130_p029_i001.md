10.5 
Withdrawals. 
10.5.1 A Member does not have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the Fund, 
withdraw any portion of its Capital Account or terminate its Capital Commitment. 
10.5.2 At any time, the Manager may require any Member to terminate or reduce its 
Capital Commitment and withdraw all or a portion of its Interest from the Fund if (i) the Manager 
reasonably believes that such Member acquired an Interest as a result of a misrepresentation, (ii) 
such Member is a "benefit plan investor" (within the meaning of the Plan Asset Regulations) and 
such withdrawal is necessary for the assets of the Fund not to be treated as "plan assets" under 
ERISA, or (iii) if the Manager reasonably believes that such Member's ownership of an Interest 
would cause the Fund, the Manager, such Member or any other Member to be in violation of any 
applicable laws or regulations. The Member thus designated shall withdraw from the Fund or 
withdraw that portion of such Member's Interest specified by the Manager, as the case may be, as 
of the close of business on such date as is determined by the Manager. 
10.5.3 In the event a Member withdraws all or a portion of its Interest from the Fund 
pursuant to Section 10.5.2, the Fund shall pay such withdrawing Member an amount equal to the 
Fair Market Value of such Member's Interest as of the date of such withdrawal with respect to the 
Interest (or portions thereof being withdrawn). Such amount shall be paid without interest within 
120 days after the Manager's determination to cause such Member to withdraw; provided,
however, such payment shall not be made during any time that such payment would cause 
hardship to the Fund. The Manager shall have sole discretion to make the distribution in respect 
of the Interest of a withdrawing Member in cash or in kind. The Manager may withhold or delay 
from distribution (but in no event for longer than one year) any assets the distribution of which 
would, in the Manager's reasonable discretion, cause hardship to the Fund or to the issuer of any 
securities to be distributed in kind. The Fund's books and records shall be revised to reflect such 
withdrawal and in the case of a complete withdrawal from the Fund the withdrawing Member 
shall no longer be considered a Member for purposes of this Agreement. 
10.5.4 The Manager may, in its sole discretion, waive or modify any of the requirements 
and restrictions regarding withdrawals contained in this Agreement with respect to any Member, 
including, without limitation, Affiliated Members, without having to give any other Member 
notice of, and without entitling any other Member to, such a waiver or modification. 
11. 
WINDING UP, DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION OF THE FUND 
11.1 
Winding UP. The Fund shall be wound up upon the happening of any of the following 
events: (i) the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Fund; (ii) an election by the Manager to terminate the Fund 
that has been approved by a Majority-in-Interest of the Members; (iii) a termination required by operation 
of law, (iv) an election by a Majority-in-Interest of the Members to wind up the Fund that is delivered in 
writing to the Manager within ninety (90) days following the two (2) year anniversary of the date on 
which the Tender Offer for the Bonds was completed, in the event a Complete Disposition Event has not 
occurred by such anniversary date; and (v) an election by a Majority-in-Interest of the Members to wind 
up the Fund that is delivered in writing to the Manager within ninety (90) days following the three month 
anniversary of the Closing Date, in the event the Fund fails to acquire Bonds with aggregate face value of 
at least $50,000,000 during the Tender Offer and in any event by such date.
