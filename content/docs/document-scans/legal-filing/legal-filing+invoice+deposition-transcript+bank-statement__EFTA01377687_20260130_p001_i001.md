Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 
Total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased by $297.8 million, or 54%, compared to the year ended 
December 31, 2013. 
Transaction revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased by $274.1 million, or 63%. compared to the year 
ended December 31, 2013. This increase was attributable to growth in GPV processed of $9.0 billion, or 60%, to $23.8 billion from 
$14.8 billion. A relatively greater proportion of growth in GPV was derived from new sellers added within the year ended 
December 31, 2014; a smaller though still meaningful portion was generated by growth in GPV from the payment activity of existing 
sellers that were approved to transact with us on or prior to December 31, 2013. Our transaction revenue as a percentage of GPV 
also improved relative to the prior-year period, most notably as a result of the discontinuation in the first quarter of 2014 of our 
monthly pricing program, under which we charged sellers $275 for up to $21,000 of payment processing. Transaction revenue 
contributed 83% of total net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014, up from 79% in the year ended December 31, 2013. 
Starbucks transaction revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased by $8.6 million, or 7%, compared to the 
year ended December 31, 2013. Starbucks transaction revenue contributed 14% of total net revenue in the year ended 
December 31, 2014. down from 21% in the year ended December 31, 2013. 
Software and data product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $12.0 million and was a nominal 
amount in the year ended December 31, 2013. We launched and expanded several new services in 2014, including Square 
Capital. Software and data product revenue in 2014 also reflected the effect of our acquisition of BookFresh in February 2014 and 
Caviar in August 2014. Software and data product revenue contributed 1% of total net revenue in 2014.
