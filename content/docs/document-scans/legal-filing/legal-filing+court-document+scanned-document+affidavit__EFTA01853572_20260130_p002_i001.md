Multilateral Diplomacy Summer School at the United Nations Headquarters Ncw York. NY 
June 2013 
In June 2013. the UN Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). the New York Office initiated an intensive programme on 
multilateralism. This course aimed to extend my understanding of .and an appreciation for. multilateralism as a young 
professional in global affairs. Along with other seventeen students I was trained in the concepts of multilateralism. and its 
origins.' participated in the various work of the UN. including: the Millennium Development Goals and the Post 2015 
Sustainable Development Agenda: the role of the UN Peacekeeping Operations: and, the goals of the Department of 
Political Affairs. To this end. I was also able to gain first hand insights about the UN through the medium of presentation 
and discourse with unique UN staff. 
During the program I learned that multilateralism is both critical but complex and that it requires inter alia cooperation to reach 
an agreements. It enhanced my ability to negotiate and to work cooperatively, especially if the quest involved shared 
consensus that needs to be both broad and lasting. I conducted a detailed analysis of The Millennium Development Project-
2015 which focused on access to clean water and basic sanitation in Africa and I produced a research paper that was 
selected for publication by the United Nations Institute of Training and Research. Here is the link for my work.
