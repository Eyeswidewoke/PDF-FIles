For the Period 11/1/13 to 11/30/13 
Hedge funds generally calculate the price (the "Net Asset Values or" NAV"), 10.15 business days following the last business day of the month. For that reason, hedge fund NAVs shown will generally be 
the NAV of the month preceding this statement period. In general, the NAV is stated net of management and incentive fees. The NAV is calculated according to the General Partners or Manager's 
stated methodology. Please refer to the limited partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or other operative documentation for each hedge fund for the specific methodology used by 
the General Partner or Manager for that hedge fund or for your Investment Management or Trust account contact your J.P. Morgan team. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the 
accuracy of the information and the methodology used by the General Partner or Manager in deriving valuations. (2) any errors or omissions in compiling or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any use

documentation for further details or for your Investment Management or Trust account contact your J.P. Morgan team. 
Hedge fund redemptions are generally on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis but can sometimes be subject to a multiyear lockup before a redemption is permitted. For redemptions. there is generally 
a notification period that can be a long interval before the actual redemption date. Redemption proceeds are generally paid 15 calendar days after the final NAV is issued. but can be subject to a 
holdback of a portion of the proceeds until an annual audit of the Fund has been completed. Please refer to the applicable hedge funds operative documentation for further details or for your Investment 
Management or Trust account contact your J.P. Morgan team.

until 3060 days after completion of the Portfolio's audit, which may be 18 months or longer after the redemption date. Interest might not be paid on any proceeds pending distribution. These restrictions 
apply even if the investors account at JPMorgan is dosed. The Confidential Private Placement Memorandum and applicable Supplements contain other important information about the Global Access 
Portfolios and are available upon request or for your Investment Management or Trust account contact your J.P. Morgan team.
