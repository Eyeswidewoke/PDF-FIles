interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any 
claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to 
seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our 
indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain 
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in 
the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable 
against a third party. Mr. Zepf will not be responsible to the extent of 
any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently 
verified whether Mr. Zepf has Ancient funds to satisfy its indemnity 
obligations and, therefore. Mr. Zepf may not be able to satisfy those
obligations. We have not asked Mr. Zepf to reserve for such 
eventuality. We believe the likelihood Mr. Zepf having to indemnify 
the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all 
vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities 
execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim 
of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.

Risks 
We are a newly formed company that has conducted no operations and has generated no revenues. 
Until we complete our initial business combination, we will have no operations and will generate no 
operating revenues. In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into 
account not only the background of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank 
check company. This offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the 
Securities Act. Accordingly, you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 
419 blank check offerings. For additional information concerning how Rule 419 blank check offerings 
differ from this offering, please see "Proposed Business—Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank 
Check Companies Subject to Rule 419." You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth 
in the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 28 of this prospectus.
