Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
We determine fair value of unvested and issued awards on the grant date using an option pricing model, adjusted for a lack of 
marketability and using an expected term or time to liquidity based on judgments made by management. We also consider forfeitures for 
equity•based grants which are not expected to vest. Expected volatility is calculated based upon historical volatility data from a group of 
comparable companies over a time frame consistent with the expected life of the awards. The expected risk-free rate is based on the 
U.S. Treasury yield curve rates in effect at the time of the grant using the term most consistent with the expected life of the award. 
Dividend yield was estimated at zero as we do not anticipate making regular future distributions to stockholders. Changes in these inputs 
and assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the estimated fair value of our equity-based compensation expense. 
We are required to estimate the enterprise value underlying our equity-based awards when performing fair value calculations. Due 
to the prior absence of a market for our equity interests, enterprise value is determined by management with the assistance of valuation 
specialists. The most recent valuation was performed as of January 2015 and uses a Market and Income approach weighted at 50% 
each. The Market Approach uses the Guideline Public Company Method, which focuses on comparing the subject entity to selected 
reasonably similar (or guideline) publicly traded companies. Under this method, valuation multiples are: (i) derived from the operating 
data of selected guideline companies; (ii) evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the subject entity relative to 
the selected guideline companies; and (iii) applied to the operating data of the subject entity to arrive at an indication of value. The 
Income Approach utilized the Discounted Cash Flow ('DCF") Method. The DCF Method measures the value of the enterprise by 
estimating the present worth of the net economic benefit (cash receipts less cash outlays) to be received over the life of the company. 
The steps followed in applying this approach include estimating the expected after-tax cash flows attributable to the company over its life 
and discounts the cash flows using a rate of return that accounts for both the time value of money and investment risk factors. 
Management utilized future projections discounted using a present value factor of 9% and a long-term terminal growth rate of 2.4%. 
Grants subsequent to our initial public offering will be based on the trading value of our common stock. 
The Series 1 Incentive Units and Investor Incentive Units granted in January 2015 were valued at $22.11 per unit with a $403.7 
million aggregate fair value. Factors contributing to the January 2015 fair value included the significant improvement of the stores 
acquired as part of the NAI acquisition in 2013 and realization of operational synergies. the acquisition of United and the acquisition of 
Safeway, as well as market valuations of comparable publicly traded grocers, and general capital market conditions in the U.S. 
The Phantom Units granted in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 were valued at $21.82 per unit with a $250.2 million aggregate fair 
value. The per unit fair value of the March 2015 unit grants approximated the January 2015 unit grants.
