Notice of Customer Identification Policy 
Important Information 
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial 
institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who establishes an account, investment or 
other business relationship with a financial institution. This means that we will ask for your name, address, and other 
information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see identifying documents such as a certificate of 
formation or good standing (legal entities) or a passport or other photo identification (individuals). 
3rd EU Notice 
Governmental rules have also broadened the scope of the Bank's obligations to aid in the fight against money laundering 
and terrorist financing; these rules call for an active involvement of both asset management firms and their clients. For 
new and existing clients we currently have a legal obligation to ask our customers questions regarding their identities, 
addresses, source of funds and, if necessary, legal representatives, authorized signatories, beneficial owners or control 
structures and to collect requisite documentation to substantiate the information. Also, enhanced anti•money laundering 
requirements require that should any of the above personal or institutional information change, our clients would be 
obliged to immediately notify us of the change(s) and provide us with relevant documentation to verify these changes. 
Telephone, Facsimile or Email Instructions 
By signing below, you agree that from time to time you may give instructions by telephone, facsimile or email regarding 
the above captioned account(s) (defined herein as "Verbal Instructions"). It is understood that the risk of Verbal 
Instructions being given by person or persons purported to be you is your own. Absent the gross negligence or willful 
misconduct of Deusche Bank Trust Company Americas (DBTCA), you agree to indemnify and hold harmless DBTCA for 
any claims, losses, expenses, costs or attorneys' fees resulting from DBTCA's acting upon such misunderstood and 
unauthorized Verbal Instructions. You understand that DBTCA may, but shall not be required to, seek verification of your 
verbal, facsimile or email instructions by call back. In case of doubt, DBTCA may in its sole discretion refuse to execute 
your Verbal Instructions or any part thereof, without incurring any liability. DBTCA is under no obligation to execute your 
Verbal Instructions to transfer funds or securities to any account(s) without written instructions bearing your original 
signature. 
Joint Account Disclosure 
You have opened a joint account with DBTCA and acknowledge receipt of the following information: This deposit and any 
additions to the account shall become the property of each owner as joint tenants, and DBTCA may release the entire 
account to any owner during the lifetime of all owners. DBTCA may honor checks, orders or withdrawal requests from 
any owner during the lifetime of all owners. The Bank may be required by service of legal process to remit funds held in 
the joint account to satisfy a judgment entered against, or other valid debt incurred by, any owner of the account. DBTCA 
may honor checks, orders or withdrawal requests from the survivor(s) after the death of any owner(s) and may treat the 
account as the sole property of the survivor(s) after the death of any owner(s). Unless DBTCA receives written notice 
signed by any owner not to pay or deliver any joint deposit or addition or accrual. DBTCA shall not be liable to any owner 
for continuing to honor checks, orders or withdrawal requests from any owner. After the receipt of the notice referred to 
in the previous sentence, DBTCA may require the written authorization of any or all joint owners for any further payments 
or deliveries.
