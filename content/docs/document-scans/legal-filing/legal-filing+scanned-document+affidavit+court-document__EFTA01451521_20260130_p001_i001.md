l.704-1(bX2Xiv). 
Generally, tax allocations will follow book allocations. 
If the 
allocations made pursuant to the Onshore Feeder LP Agreement and other applicable 
agreements were successfully challenged by the IRS, the redetermination of the allocations 
to a particular Investor for U.S. federal income tax purposes could be less favorable than 
the allocations set forth in the applicable agreements. 
Adjusted Tax Basis for Investor Interest. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an 
Investor's adjusted tax basis for its Interest generally will be equal to the amount of cash 
such Investor contributes plus the adjusted basis at the time of contribution of any property 
contributed (the "Capital Contribution") and will be increased by (a) any additional 
Capital Contributions made by such Investor and (b) such Investor's allocable share of (i) 
items of Onshore Feeder Fund taxable income and gain and (ii) nonrecourse indebtedness 
of the Onshore Feeder Fund (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes and allocated 
among the Investors in accordance with their profit sharing ratios). Such adjusted tax basis 
generally will be decreased, but not below zero, by such Investor's allocable share of (i) 
items of Onshore Feeder Fund taxable deduction, expense and loss and (ii) cash 
distributions by the Onshore Feeder Fund (including, in certain circumstances, 
distributions of certain "marketable securities") or constructive distributions resulting from 
a reduction in such Investor's share of nonrecourse indebtedness of the Onshore Feeder 
Fund. 
If the recognition of an Investor's distributive share of Master Fund losses would reduce its 
adjusted tax basis for its Interest below zero, the recognition of such losses by the Investor 
would be deferred until such time as the recognition of such losses would not reduce the 
Investor's tax basis below zero. 
Distributions. Cash distributions, including distributions of certain "marketable 
securities," from the Onshore Feeder Fund to Investors are not generally taxable, and 
instead reduce the adjusted basis of the Investor's Interest in the Onshore Feeder Fund, as 
described above. However, to the extent that the Onshore Feeder Fund's cash distributions 
(or constructive cash distributions, as described above) were to reduce an Investor's 
adjusted tax basis for its Interest below zero, such distributions would constitute taxable 
income to the Investor and would be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of its 
Interest. 
In general, distributions (other than liquidating distributions) of property other than cash 
(and, in certain circumstances, marketable securities) will reduce the basis (but not below 
zero) of an Investor's Interest by the amount of the Onshore Feeder Fund's basis in such 
property immediately before its distribution, but will not result in the realization of taxable 
income to the Investor, and the Investor will have a carryover tax basis and holding period 
in the distributed property. 
Sale or Disposition of Interests. A sale of an Interest (including, in general, upon a 
liquidation of the Onshore Feeder Fund) generally will result in the recognition of gain or 
loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the sales proceeds, 
including an Investor's share of nonrecourse indebtedness of the Onshore Feeder Fund, 
and the Limited Partner's adjusted tax basis for its Interest. Such Investor's adjusted tax
