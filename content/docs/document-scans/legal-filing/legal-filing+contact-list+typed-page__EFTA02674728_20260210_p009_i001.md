may be important for refining our understanding of hemi-
spheric specialization. Inferoparietal association cortex, near 
the boundary of temporal and parietal lobes, helps maintain 
attention to the outside world (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002), 
and its damage, particularly on the right side, results in atten-
tional impairment (Heilman et al., 2003). Prefrontal cortex 
found on the lateral aspect of the hemisphere (dorsolateral and 
ventrolateral) is critical for accessing and activating task-
relevant representations found in the posterior association 
cortices (O'Reilly and Munakata, 2000; )onides et al., 2008; Van 
Snellenberg and Wager, 2009). Close neuroanatomical connec-
tivity and functional relationship exists between the posterior 
heteromodal association cortices and lateral prefrontal heter-
omodal association cortices (Goldman-Rakic, 1988; Fuster, 
2008). By contrast, mesial/orbitomesial prefrontal and anterior 
cingulate cortices (ACCs) are critical for salience-driven deci-
sion making guided to a large extent by the organisms's internal 
states, motivations and needs (Bechara et al., 1998; Koenigs 
et al., 2007; Botvinick et al., 1999; Caner et al., 1999). The func-
tional implications of the dual lateral versus mesial hetero-
modal association cortical asymmetry with opposite and 
complementary cortical space allocation are intriguing and 
they await further clarification. A possible relationship between 
hemispheric differences in heteromodal versus modality-
specific cortical space allocation and the differential roles of 
the two hemispheres in learning was ascertained in the old 
literature (Goldberg and Costa, 1981), but it clearly requires a re-
examination with modern methodology. 
4.2. 
Modality-specific cortical asymmetries 
We also found hemispheric differences in the modality-
specific cortical regional volumes. Areas implicated in visual 
processing are more extensive in the light than left 
hemisphere. By contrast, somatosensory cortex, auditory 
cortex, portions of premotor cortex, and motor cortices 
controlling oropharyngeal structures are more extensive in 
the left than right hemisphere. Our findings that the superior 
temporal gyms, plenum temperate, and inferior portion of the 
motor areas are volumetrically larger in the left than right 
hemisphere parallel previously reported asymmetries in the 
plenum temporak and frontal operculum (Geschwind and 
Levitsky, 1968; Galaburda et al., 1978). Luders et al (2006) re-
ported a similar pro-left hemispheric asymmetry in the 
cortical thickness of anterior temporal-lobe structures. Our 
finding of pro-right hemispheric differences in the volume of 
cortex implicated in visual processing parallels the cortical 
surface differences reported by Lyttelton et al. (2009) and 
cortical thickness differences reported by Luders et al. (2006). 
These asymmetries are broadly consistent with the 
commonly described left hemispheric dominance for 
language and right hemispheric dominance for visuo-spatial 
processing in humans. 
4.3. 
Cortical space allocation on the latentl versus mesial 
aspects of the hemispheres 
Cortical space allocation on the lateral (convexital) aspect 
appears to follow a relatively clear pattern. Heteromodal 
association cortices are more extensively represented in the 
right than in the left hemisphere. We found this to be true 
both for the prefrontal and for the inferoparietal cortices. By 
contrast, modality-specific cortices are more extensively 
represented in the left than in the right hemisphere. Our data 
confirmed this for somatosensory cortex, auditory cortex, 
portions of premotor cortex, and motor cortices controlling 
oropharyngeal structures. This is consistent with the earlier 
predictions (Goldberg and Costa, 1981).
