Subject: Carol S. Chomsky Marital =rusts - Distribution 
Deborah — 
I'm following up on our conversation on =uesday about principal distributions to Noam from the Carol S. 
Chomsky =arital trusts. Please consider the following: 
1. 
As I stated to you and as I now affirm to =ou in writing, I am certain that in the exercise of my discretionary 
=ower to make distributions of principal from the trusts I'm =ntitled to inquire into Noam's financial circumstances, 
=ncluding (a) the nature and extent of his resources, (b) his sources of =ncome, and (c) his expenditures. In fact, I'm 
equally =ertain that my fiduciary duty to Noam requires me to obtain that =nformation so as to adequately address his 
long-term needs and to =nsure that the trust is used for his exclusive benefit during his =ifetime. (I am mindful of the 
interests of Noam's =hildren, as residuary beneficiaries of the trusts, and of my fiduciary =uty to them as well, but as I've 
stated to you previously, my =rimary concern has been and continues to be Noam's =nterests.) 
2. 
Having previously been assured (prior to =aking tax payments on Noam's behalf at the end of 2015 and in 
=arly 2016) that Noam would engage in a financial planning process with =ick Nichols, and having notified you at the 
time that I did not intend =o make any further principal distributions until that process was =ompleted, I informed you 
on Tuesday that I was not prepared to make any =rincipal distributions to Noam now. On further reflection, and =indful 
of Noam's distress, I've reconsidered the =ircumstances and am willing to make the proposed $150,000 payment to =he 
IRS on his behalf, provided that you will (a) urge Noam to engage in = financial planning process (with Nick Nichols or 
another financial =rofessional of his choosing), (b) urge Noam to cooperate in =roviding some information to me about 
his financial resources, income =nd expenses (to a degree mutually acceptable), and (c) impress upon =oam the fact that 
though I am now making another tax payment from the =rust on his behalf, I do so with no intention of making further 
=istributions of principal unless he completes the financial planning =nd disclosure process that was agreed upon in 
2015. 
3. 
Lastly, with respect to my trusteeship, I =ave suggested to Harry Chomsky that I prepare a short list of 
=ualified, professional trustees for his consideration and for Noam'=. It is my hope that one of those candidates would 
be acceptable to =arry and to Noam (with your recommendation). This seems to me a good =pproach, given that Harry 
has unequivocally declared his unwillingness =o appoint Rich Kahn as my successor. Needless to say, if you'= like to 
suggest another approach to finding a successor to me I will =e glad to discuss it with Harry.
