DISCUSSION 
A. Treatment of Variable Annuities Generally 
An annuity is defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally as a contract 
that is considered to be an annuity contract in accordance with the customary practice of life 
insurance companies.2 The annuity must provide for a series of scheduled payments to the 
annuitant at some point in the future. Under the terms of a PPVA, generally the series of 
scheduled payments must begin no later than when the annuitant reaches the age of 95 or 100, 
and the entire PPVA account value must be distributed by the annuitant's age 125 or 130. An 
annuity generally must be held by a natural person, including a trust or other entity as an agent 
for a natural person? There are certain exceptions to this rule, including an annuity acquired by 
the estate of a decedent because of the death of the decedent. 
1. Treatment of Scheduled Payments on the Annuity 
Section 72 of the Code applies to determine income taxation of scheduled, 
periodic payments from a PPVA after the annuity starting date.4 Such payments are generally 
referred to in section 72 of the Code as "amounts received as an annuity."5 Under these rules, 
the owner will generally not be taxed on the return of their investment in the PPVA but amounts 
in excess of the return of investment allocated to each payment are includible as ordinary income 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
For a variable annuity such as the PPVA, the return on investment is considered 
equal to the expected return on the contract.' Under Treasury Reputations, the owner's 
investment in the contract is apportioned to each payment period. 
Generally, for a variable 
annuity such as the PPVA, the investment in the contract is divided by the anticipated number of 
payments to be made to determine what portion of each of the periodic payments should be 
treated as a return of investment not subject to taxation.8 The amount of the periodic payment in 
excess of this allocated portion of the return on investment is included in gross income as 
2 Treas. Reg. § 1.72-200(4 
3 I.R.C. § 72(u). If the holder does not meet this requirement, the income on the contract is treated as ordinary 
income received or accrued by the owner during the tax year. The income on the contract is generally measured by 
the excess of the net surrender value of the contract as of the close of the tax year plus all distributions paid over the 
sum of net premiums paid and amounts includible in gross income for prior years. Id. 
4 Subject to certain exceptions, the "annuity starting date" is defined generally as the first day of the first period for 
which an amount is received as an annuity. Treas. Reg. § 1.724(bX1). The first day of the first period for which 
an amount is received as an annuity is the later of (i) the date upon which the obligations under the contract become 
fixed, or (ii) the first day of the period (year. half-year. quarter. month, or otherwise. depending on whether 
payments are to be made annually, semi-annually, quarterly. monthly. or otherwise) which ends on the date of the 
first annuity payment Id. 
3 See Treas. Reg. §§ 1.72-1(b): I.72-2(b)(2). (3) (indicating that. among other things. an "amount received as an 
annuity" (i) must be received on or after the annuity starring date, and (ii) must be payable in periodic installments 
at regular intervals over a period of more than one full year from the annuity starting date). 
6 Treas. Reg. § I.72-4d)(3Xi).

81d. Detailed rules apply to determine the investment in the contract, including adjustments for refund provisions.
