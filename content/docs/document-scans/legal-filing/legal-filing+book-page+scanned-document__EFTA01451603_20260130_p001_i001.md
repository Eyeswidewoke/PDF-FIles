SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Secondary Opportunities Fund III, LP 
Dilution from subsequent closings 
Investors subscribing for Interests after the First Closing will participate in existing investments of the Fund, diluting the 
interest of existing Investors therein. 
Although such Investors will contribute their pro rata share of prior Fund 
drawdowns (plus interest), there can be no assurance that this payment will reflect the fair value of the Fund's existing 
investments at the time such additional Interests are subscribed for. 
Indemnification 
The Fund will indemnify, and hold harmless, the General Partner, the Second GP, the Manager and each of their 
respective affiliates who have acted directly or indirectly on behalf of the Fund; each of the current and former officers, 
directors, employees, managers, agents of any of the General Partner, the Second GP, the Manager and each of their 
respective affiliates who have acted directly or indirectly on behalf of the Fund; each person serving, or who has served, 
as a member of the Fund Advisory Committee (and, with respect to claims or damages arising out of or relating to such 
service only, the Investor that such person represents and each of such Investors officers, directors, employees, 
partners, members, managers, agents and other representatives); and any other third party designated by the General 
Partner as a covered person who serves at the request of the General Partner or the Manager directly or indirectly on 
behalf of the Fund from and against any liabilities, actions, proceedings, claims, costs, demands and expenses to which 
they may become subject by reason of their activities on behalf of the Fund, unless such liabilities, actions, proceedings, 
claims, costs, demands and expenses result from certain conduct of such indemnified person as specified in the Fund 
Partnership Agreement. Indemnification of these indemnified persons may impair the financial condition of the Fund and 
its ability to acquire investments or otherwise achieve its investment objective or meet its obligations. Furthermore, the 
Investors may be required to return certain distributions for the purpose of satisfying any claim under such indemnity, 
subject to certain limitations. 
Short-term investments 
Amounts drawn down from Investors will be invested by the Fund in short-term instruments pending investment in 
secondaries transactions. During such interim periods, these short-term investments may produce lower returns for 
Investors than the returns eamed by direct investors in the underlying private equity funds in which the Fund invests (or 
by direct investors in portfolio companies) for the same period. 
Follow-on investments 
The Fund may be called upon to provide follow-up funding for portfolio companies or have the opportunity to increase its 
investment in such portfolio companies. There can be no assurance that the Manager will wish to make follow-on 
investments or that the Fund will have sufficient funds to do so. Any decision by the Manager not to make follow-on 
investments or its inability to make them may have a substantial negative impact on a portfolio company in need of such 
an investment or may diminish the Fund's ability to influence the portfolio company's future development. 
Risks upon disposition of investments 
In connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company or otherwise, the Fund may be required to 
make representations about the business and financial affairs of the portfolio company typical of those made in 
connection with the sale of any business, or may be responsible for the contents of disclosure documents under 
applicable securities laws. 
The Fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment or 
underwriters to the extent that any such representations or disclosure documents turn out to be incorrect, inaccurate or 
misleading. These arrangements may result in contingent liabilities, which might ultimately have to be funded by the 
Investors. The Fund Partnership Agreement contains provisions to the effect that if there is any such claim in respect of 
a portfolio company, it may be funded by the Investors to the extent that they have received distributions from the Fund, 
subject to certain limitations. 
Furthermore, the Investors may, under certain circumstances, be required to return certain distributions for the purpose
