conditions approved with the Requisite Approval; provided in each case that such terms do not

(b) 
The Key Holders and the Investors shall each take all necessary and

covenants, conditions, non-compete agreements (with respect to Key Holders only), escrow 
agreements and other provisions and agreements relating to such Approved Sale and (ii) 
effectuate the allocation and distribution of the aggregate consideration upon the Approved Sale, 
if applicable.

related to authority, ownership and the ability to convey title to such shares, including but not 
limited to representations and warranties that (i) the Key Holder or Investor holds all right, title
