We will continue working on the infrastructure projects without any delay. What is currently under 
implementation will be completed, while we will re-schedule the new projects. The changes of the strategic plan 
will be announced as soon as the committee finishes reviewing them. Plans are always subject to change in 
normal times and in times of crisis.

Despite the competitive investment environment enjoyed by the UAE, with its advanced 
regional advantages, there are some aspects of the legislative environment that do not quite 
match the levels of development and state of the national economy. Do we expect any 
updating of the present laws, soon? 
The economy is like a living being, whose demands and needs change with constant growth and development. 
Though we realize this fact, the Council of Ministers has lately decided to establish the Emirates Council for 
Competitiveness. Its task is to develop strategies and suggest policies and legal frameworks that can support the 
competitive environment in the light of local, regional and international variables. These frameworks serve the 
objective of comprehensive development, and protect the Emirates position among the most competitive states on 
the international arena. 
The Council consists of a number of ministers concerned with this question. It is headed by the Minister for 
Cabinet Affairs, and includes the Ministers of Economy and Foreign Trade, Education, Labor. Health, the 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, and for Financial Affairs. In addition, there are seven representatives of 
administrative boards in the local governments, the chairman of the Union of Trade and Industry Chambers in the 
State, Directors of Trade and Industry Chambers in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. We are confident that the Council is 
able to draw strategies and legislative frames to secure the desired development of the competitive capacity of 
the UAE. 
By Ro'ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper 
In the first quarter oft his year, accelerating economic events have generated pessimism 
about the future of the global economy and its growth. There are conflicting reports in the 
assessment of the national economy, and we read some of the studies questioning the 
continuation of Western-style development plans and their future in the region in light of 
declining oil prices and the global crisis. What is the assessment of Your Highness on the 
national economy today, can it be maintained at the level of growth in the light of the retreat 
of oil prices? What is the policy that the UAE will use with regard to the latest 
developments of the global financial crisis? 
Our economy is strong and its potential lies in its great diversity. The proportion of oil in the UAE's GDP is less 
than 30 percent, and this reduces the impact of oil price fluctuations on the national economy. I agree with you 
regarding the presence of many pessimistic reports on the world economy, but it's an exaggerated and unrealistic 
pessimism. Countries with the largest economies are seriously committed to rehabilitating the economy, while the 
summit of the Group of Twenty came out with encouraging results after meeting in London recently. Our hope is 
to commit ourselves to the implementation of all decisions. In fact, the negative vibrations will decrease, and will 
be substituted by cautious optimism. As for the levels of growth, few states in the world are likely to maintain 
high levels of growth recorded in recent years. We in the UAE wi II achieve economic growth rates lower than 
those recorded in previous years.
