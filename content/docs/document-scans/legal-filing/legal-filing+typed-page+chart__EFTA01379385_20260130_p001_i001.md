EM Currency Handbook 2018: Still Fuel in the Tank 
India 
Between 1947 and 1975 the rupee was linked to GBP. 
Import 
restrictions 
and 
export 
subsidies 
were 
punctuated with periodic devaluations to address 
balance of payment crises. Its anchor was switched to 
a trade-weighted FX basket, but the central bank (RBI) 
was forced to devalue the rupee in 1991 and introduce 
a two-tier system of FX. The current regime dates back 
to March 1993, when the government reintroduced a 
unified, market-determined managed float. The Foreign 
Exchange Management Act was introduced in 2000. 
The monetary framework of the Reserve Bank of India 
was formerly built on multiple indicators. However, 
following the recommendation of the Urijit Patel 
Committee Report, RBI shifted to a consumer price 
inflation targeting approach in 2014. RBI aimed to 
guide CPI to below 6% by Jan 2016 and below 5% by 
March 2017, with a long-term inflation objective of 4%. 
In 2016, the Finance Ministry officially adopted an 
inflation target of 4% for the next five years with +/-2% 
tolerance limits. RBI sets its policy primarily via the 
repo/reverse repo rate corridor, but supplements it with 
liquidity management tools such as the liquidity 
adjustment facility, cash reserve ratios, open market 
operations and term repos. In 2016, RBI moved from a 
long-standing liquidity deficit regime, to targeting 
liquidity neutrality to encourage greater monetary 
transmission. RBI also introduced a six-member MPC. 
In the early to mid-20005, FX policy was oriented at 
ensuring that the rupee maintained its competitiveness 
in inflation-adjusted terms. After the 2008 financial 
crisis, the current account deficit steadily deteriorated. 
Reserves were not aggressively accumulated in 2009-
2010, when large inflows led to appreciation. As capital 
flow volatility began to increase in late 2011 alongside 
a deepening deficit, the rupee depreciated, often 
sharply. During the extreme stress of mid-2013, a 
scheme to incentivize non-resident Indian USD 
deposits 
inflows 
was 
introduced, 
gold 
import 
restrictions were tightened and oil USD demand was 
managed to curb currency pressure. Since 2013, the 
current account has dramatically improved; portfolio 
inflows have been strong; RBI has aggressively built 
back reserves, and volatility in the currency has been 
very closely managed. The rupee is convertible for 
current account transactions, but has restrictions on 
the capital account. Foreign portfolio investment policy 
is more liberal for equity than debt, with the latter 
managed via a quota system. A medium-term 
framework for FPI investment in debt securities was 
put in place in 2015, targeting an increase in foreign 
limits to 5% of the outstanding government debt 
securities market by 2018. Corporate borrowing in

foreign currency is subject to regulation and caps. FDI 
liberalization has been a growing focal point.
