Prinuuy Growth Dricei a 
Volume growth from 2015-2020 is primarily driven by the continued 
development of Pre-Salt resource in the deepwater Santos and Campos Basins. 
In particular, near-term volume growth is expected to come from the start of 
FPSOs in the Buzios and Lula/Iracema development. Development at Lula-
Iracema (the largest driver of growth through 2017) entails a total of 10 FPSOs 
(8 in Lula, 2 in (raceme). 3 FPSOs are currently in operation and 7 additional 
FPSOs will be required for development (150 Mb/d of capacity each), 4 of 
which are replicant FPSOs being constructed in Brazil. 
Pi Unary Risks 
Project execution, already problematic in recent years given the combination of 
technical challenges and local content requirements, have become particularly 
acute given the collapse in oil price and corruption scandal affecting both 
Petrobras and the Brazilian government. We see two primary risks: 
1. Weak oil price and uncertain investment environment could impact 
investment in the base (ie. maintenance capital), increasing the 
underlying decline at the 2.4 MMb/d of current production. We see 
this risk as slightly less acute than some basins heavily dependent on 
maintenancefunfill capital spend (ie. UK North Sea/Norway). however 
every 1% increase in underlying decline above our 8%/yr base case 
would reduce 2017 production by 40 Mb/d. 
2. Delays to FPSO start-ups. We see a high likelihood of material delays 
in the start-ups of future FPSOs. particularly the 4 replicant FPSOs 
being constructed in Brazil with targeted start-ups in 2017-2018 (Lula 
South, Lula North, Lula Extension, and Lula West - P-66, P-67. P-68, 
P-69). We have risked project starts in proportion to local content 
requirements (Buzios, Taratuga Verde). assuming an average 2-year 
delay in targeted first oil. We model an estimated -225 Mb/d of 
incremental production through 2017 from the arrival of 4 FPSOs 
through (2 in each 2016 and 2017); the modeled production 
contribution increases to over 900 Mb/d by 2020.
