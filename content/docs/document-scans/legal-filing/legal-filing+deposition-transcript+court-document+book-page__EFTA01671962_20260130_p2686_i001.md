Details of Important Changes to Your Cardmember Agreement 
This notice amends the Cardmember Agreement (the "Agreement") as described below. We have the right to 
amend it as described in the Agreement. Any terms in the Agreement conflicting with this change are replaced 
fully and completely. Terms not changed by this notice remain in full force and effect. We encourage you to read 
this notice, share it with Additional Cardmembers on your account, and file it for future reference. If you have any 
questions about this change, please call the number on the back of your Card. 
Effective immediately, the Rates and Fees Table in Part 1 of the Cardmember Agreement is amended by 
revising the Plan Fee (Fixed Finance Charge) row to add a reference to "monthly" to clarify that the Plan Fee is 
charged on a monthly basis. 
Effective February 1, 2019, the About using your card section in Part 2 of your Cardmember Agreement is 
amended by deleting the About the Plan It feature sub-section and replacing it with the following: 
About 
the 
Plan It 
feature 
We may offer you Plan It, which allows 
you to create a payment plan for qualifying 
purchases, subject to a plan fee. This fee is 
a fixed finance charge that will be charged 
each month that a plan is active. 
You may use this feature by selecting a 
qualifying purchase(s) and a plan duration. 
You will be able to view the monthly plan 
payments, including the plan fee, for your 
selection. Each plan fee will be disclosed 
prior to your establishing the applicable 
plan and will be based on the plan duration, 
the APR that would otherwise apply to the 
purchase(s), and other factors. When you 
set up a plan, the purchase(s) will be moved 
to a plan balance and will be subject to a 
plan fee instead of the APR for purchases. 
A qualifying purchase for Plan It is a 
purchase of at least a specified dollar 
amount and does not include a purchase 
of cash or cash equivalents, or a purchase 
subject to Foreign Transaction Fees or 
any fee owed to us, including Annual 
Membership fees. 
Your ability to initiate new plans will be based on a 
variety of factors such as your creditworthiness or 
your Credit Limit. You will not be able to initiate 
plans if your Account is cancelled. You will also 
not be able to initiate plans if one or more of your 
American Express accounts is enrolled into a 
debt management program, or has a payment 
that is returned unpaid, or is delinquent. We will 
tell you the number of active plans you may have 
and we may change this number at any time. The 
plan durations offered to you, and your ability to 
include multiple qualifying purchases into a single 
plan, will be at our discretion and will be based on 
a variety of factors such as your creditworthiness, 
the amount of the purchase(s), and your Account 
history. 
Plans cannot be cancelled after they have been 
set up but you can choose to pay them early by 
paying the New Balance shown on your most 
recent billing statement in full. If you pay a plan 
off early, you will not incur any future plan fees on 
that plan.
