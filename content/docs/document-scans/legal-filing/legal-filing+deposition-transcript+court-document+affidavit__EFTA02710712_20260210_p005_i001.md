3. Unauthorized IMMIGRANTS are settling in the South 
President Obama began the public =ush for his executive order in Nevada, but while that state does have a high Latino 
population and the highest PERCENTAGE of illegal immigrants in the country, it doesn't mak= the top 10 of states as far 
as total undocumented population. (Roughly 21=,000 undocumented immigrants live in Nevada.) This list, which is 
mostly made of blue states, isn't exactly surprising. Georgia and North Caroli=a are part of a more widespread Latino 
population boom in the South. Relative to =he overall population, Latinos -- undocumented and otherwise -- make up a 
smal= share. But their growth is rapid, doubling in some states in recent years.

4. Well over half of the illegal IMMIGRANT population arrived after 1995=/p> 
Obama's executive action will cover people wh= have citizen or legal permanent resident CHILDREN who have been here 
for at least five year=, meaning 2009 or before. His move will also expand the time frame use for the Deferred Action 
for Childhood Arriva=s (DACA) measure to include any children who were brought to this country illegally before 2010. 
5. The population is very young 
Back in 2012= during a GOP presidential debate, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney sparred over deporting "grandmothers 
and grandfathers," zeroing in a demographic that is actually a ver= small part of the illegal-immigrant population. Some 
80 PERCENT are 4= years old and under, meaning they have a number of working and childbearing years in front of 
th=m. This means an expanded tax base for those that get work permits, but also m=ans that in some instances people 
live "off the grid," while still utilizing SCHOOL systems and hospitals. 
Illegal immigrants make up a 5.1 PERCENT of the workforce 
Because of that youth, illegal immigrants are over-repre=ented in the workforce -- 5.1 percent versus 3.5 percent of the 
overall populatio=. During his speech announcing his executive order, Obama made several references to illegal 
immigrants roles in the =orkforce. He talked about "workers who pick our fruit and make our beds" and "the 
determination of immigrant fath=rs who worked two or three JOBS without taking a dime from the government.&quo=; 
Dating back to 1995, as their population rose, illegal immigrants have steadily joined the workforce, peaking in 201=. 
The parents of lawful permanent residents and citizens who have been here for more than five years will be able to 
apply =or work permits and temporary relief from deportation. 
7. 7 percent of k-12 STUDENTS have an undocumented PARENT 
Another are where the undocumented are over-repre=ented versus their share of the population is as parents. In fact, 7 
percent of non-coll=ge students have at least one parent who is undocumented. Obama talked a=lot about students in 
his speech, acknowledging "the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as Americ=n as 
Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes t=ey could make a difference in the country 
they love." And it I-=;s no accident that he gave his first speech outside of the beltway at a SCHOOL IN Nevada, where 
17.7 perce=t of school children have a parent who is an illegal immigrant.
