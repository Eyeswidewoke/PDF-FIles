would refrain from lending and global liquidity would evaporate. In any event, when they begin the 
process of write-offs against sovereign debt, they will simply not have the capital to lend further. 
Whilst the process of recapitalising these banks will have to take place, this is usually a longer term 
affair with serious consequences for short term lending. The actual outcome may well be somewhere in 
the middle of these two scenarios. For now, Indian business managers need to be conscious of the 
following 
Firstly, liquidity. When financial markets go into a crisis, liquidity dries up. India's external debt 
coming up for repayment in the next 9-12 months is —USD 130 bn. Of this, short term and export 
credit constitutes USD 87 bn. In a banking crisis, it is unlikely that this debt would be refinanced or 
rolled over, and therefore, borrowers would have no choice but to raise money in local markets to 
settle offshore repayments. The consequences of such a scenario would be profound. Liquidity within 
India will be squeezed and the Rupee, already under pressures in the foreign exchange markets, will 
come under a bout of bear hammering. Inflation will rise and economic growth may begin to falter. 
Secondly, capital. Another global financial crisis (GFC 2) would stir a flight of capital from India, as 
we noticed in 2008. Investors usually return to the comfort of home currencies in times of global 
uncertainties. A lot of the foreign capital inflows into emerging markets are by hedge funds and other 
institutional investors who have raised money through the dollar carry trade. When markets panic, the 
carry trade reverses. The consequences are falling currency values, evaporating liquidity, falling stock 
markets and a decline in other asset values. 
Thirdly, exports. India's exports to the European Union are a sizeable fraction, but declining. As this 
note went to print, the Government released the latest data on trade which suggested that total exports 
grew by 12.4% in October (much slower than the 36% in September and the 52% in the Apr-
September period). The trend is clearly declining and a crisis will further affect this. I believe that Asian 
countries will in the coming years work towards reducing their trade reliance on advanced economies 
in favour of Regional trade within Asia. India will therefore, have to do the same. In the meantime 
however, the derailment of Western demand will force Chinese companies to look aggressively for 
substitute markets within Asia, specifically India. For instance, capital goods suppliers will come with 
lucrative financing packages; consumer goods companies will set up distribution networks; and so on. 
Cleary every crisis comes with a silver lining. Cash rich Indian companies seeking to acquire assets 
abroad will be able to do so at competitive rates within the Euro zone countries. Coupled with this, we 
suspect that commodity prices, which have already shown a tendency to moderate, will begin to correct 
in the months ahead. In the shorter term, the Rupee may weaken further (offsetting some of the gains 
in commodity price moderation) but in the longer term, after the initial panic has subsided, capital 
flows into India will resume and the currency will strengthen. Ultimately, India's ability to recover from 
a crisis is more dependent on how its domestic economy is managed. A well managed economy would 
ensure the return of capital flows; new investments; trade; and effectively, buoyancy. Investors would 
look towards India's fiscal deficit; inflation; and key aspects of governance. A proactive Government 
within India will ensure a quick recovery; a Government in denial will ensure the opposite. The weeks 
ahead will be interesting.
