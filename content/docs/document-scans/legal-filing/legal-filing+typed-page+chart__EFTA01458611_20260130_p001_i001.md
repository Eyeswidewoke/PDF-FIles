FX Forecasts and Valuations: Don't throw in the towel 
In Table 1 above we outline a framework for thinking about the USD, and the 
differentiation between different states of risk appetite. It is the different 
potential policy responses to risk appetite that have confused the picture on 
the majors recently. 
State 1: This state is risk neutral/positive. The working assumption for much 
of the year was that the risk environment would not derail a Fed tightening 
cycle. In State 1, the data and risk appetite is constructive enough to allow for 
Fed tightening, while other G3 Central Banks are on hold. 
EUR/USD is then 
assumed to very roughly conform to the past response of going down -10 big 
figures for every 100bp move in the 2yr USD - EUR spread. The forward curve 
is pricing in close to 100bps of additional spread adjustment in favor of the 
USD over the next 2 years, and the spread adjustment will likely go well 
beyond that once/if the Fed tightening cycle finally starts.

imply for the spread in the next 5 years 
SOK* DOUOICAI 
State 2 has been the environment we have largely been operating in for the 
last few months. Here risk related to market volatility is such that it delays the 
Fed, but is not sufficient to get the ECB and BoJ to add to their respective QE 
programs. In this instance EUR/USD tracks essentially sideways in the recent 
1.08 to 1.15 range. Wide daily ranges prevail, but longer-term weekly/monthly 
ranges for G4 currency pairs prove relatively narrow. State 2 is when the EUR 
is negatively correlated with risky assets (like equities), but this will not last a 
shift into State 1 or State 3. In contrast, Commodity and EM underperform all 
G4 majors, and display elevated volatility. 
State 3 is when risk is consistently negative - enough that not only does it 
keep the Fed steady but it propels the ECB and B0J into action with more QE 
accommodation. In this case EUR/USD tests the cycle low and probably 
extends to parity. 
Risk trades mostly negative, except immediately after the 
policy response. Note State 3 and State 2 may initially be difficult to 
separate. In State 3, the EUR is now hurt when risk is negative. 
State 4 is if Risk Appetite turns exceedingly negative to the point where the 
Fed is driven to ease, quite possibly with QE4 and/or negative interest 
rates. The B0J and ECB also ease. The probability of entering this state is still 
a low delta. 
This resembles aspects of 2008, where the USD initially does 
very well in the 'risk off' phase, then weakens sharply with the Fed policy 
response, especially if it includes negative rates. EM FX does the reverse of 
the USD. EUR/USD goes to parity then back up above 1.20, and FX vol for 
both G10 and EM goes crazy!
