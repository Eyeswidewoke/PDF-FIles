748 F.2d 602, "; 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 15990, **; 
1984-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P66,311; 40 Fed. R. Serv. 2d (Callaghan) 954 
In determining whether such threats, especially Twentieth ("15] Century Fox's and 
Warner Brothers' communications to exhibitors of October 31 and November 22, ['6O8] 
1977, supra, played a role in the advertisers' decisions, we must view the evidence in a 
light most favorable to SAFFCO. In doing so, we conclude that a large number of movie 
theatres, both those who had agreed to contribute to SAFFCO's Film Fund and those who 
had not, withdrew from the Cinemavision's screen advertising program because of the 
distributors' coercive conduct and that such withdrawal was a natural cause of 
Cinemavision's failure. These exhibitors could not risk losing their supply of motion 
pictures and had no choice except to refuse to exhibit on-screen advertising. We think a 
jury could infer that this significant contraction in the number of screens participating in 
Cinemavision's advertising program reduced its attractiveness as an advertising medium. 
A network of five thousand screens was obviously more attractive than one with only two 
thousand screens to national advertisers who wished to reach the largest audience 
possible. In sum, the inference that the distributors' conduct may have caused SAFFCO's 
injury was sufficient to preclude the entry ("16] of summary judgment. Thrasher v. State

Patterson challenges the district court's conclusion that he lacked standing to pursue his 
antitrust claims. His challenge lacks merit. [HN5] Standing to prosecute a private antitrust 
action under section 4 of the Clayton Act requires the plaintiff to prove that "he is within 
that sector of the economy which is endangered by a breakdown of competitive conditions 
in a particular industry." Jeffrey v. Southwestern Bell, 518 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir.1975). 
See Construction Aggregate Transport, Inc. v. Florida Rock Industries, Inc., 710 F.2d 752, 
762 (11th Cir.1983). The plaintiff must be the target against which anticompetitive activity 
is directed. Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705, 710 (11th 
Cir.1984); Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon Corp., 632 F.2d 539, 546-47 (5th Cir.1980), 
("17] cert. denied, 454 U.S. 927, 102 S. Ct. 427, 70 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1981). The injury must 
be "of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which 
makes defendants' act unlawful." Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 
477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 697, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). "Incidental or consequential injury 
or injury remotely caused by an antitrust violation does not give a plaintiff standing to 
complain that he has been injured by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws." 
Midwestern Waffles, 734 F.2d at 710-11. See Jeffrey, 518 F.2d at 1131 (citing cases). 
The film production and distribution market was the target of the distributors' alleged 
anticompetitive behavior in this case. Patterson never intended or prepared to enter this 
market, whether as a sole proprietor or as a member of a partnership or joint venture. 
Moreover, there was no evidence that any of the distributors' alleged behavior was 
directed against him individually. He clearly fell outside the target area. 
Patterson claimed individual injury in his capacity as an officer and shareholder ("18] of 
SAFFCO, the target of the alleged conspiracy. The law on standing in this situation is 
clear. [HN6] Neither an officer nor an employee of a corporation has standing to bring an 
action in his own right for an antitrust violation causing injury to the corporation and its
