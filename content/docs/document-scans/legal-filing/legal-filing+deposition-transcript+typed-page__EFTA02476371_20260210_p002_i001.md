up the kazoo but nothing =t all done.( the office was told by Brad not to share the outsie proposals with me =AO - brad 
has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of=finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in the 
office. he is=a little man , using your power, to appear larger . Eileen was self aware =nough to know she was over her 
head , that is a huge difference. =AO bad info is rampant a simple emblematic example- 3 mi=lion in deductions Imwer 
taken fo= art space but on closer examination it turns out they cannot =e used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will 
be told yes they wer= deducted on the return they said that is the question you were focu=ed on ! " were they 
deducted " not -" is =here a benefit " !! I asked for the balance sheet =nd P and L for =span>Regan arts , a basic first 
step in order to=check your financials. "sorry we never got one?" th=ugh 9.8 million invested, no p&I, nothing!, a 
constructio= project run amok, no budget, the coo fired after only 3 mont=s. , no clue . fyi<=span> artspace finan=ials 
are also a total mess. ( no receivables ??) 
=AO As in your words probably your closest friend and in order =o turn the page. I hope the following to be 
constructive 
He=e is a list of things I think would be in your interest=C2 to get done asap .but definitely not by me . 
=A0i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax p=rtner. use your trading accounts as they remain a 
=aramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their importan=e. THe Phaidon transaction papered and =A0 
structured as contemplated DOES NOT WORK , its as simple as that. =DOES NOT !! 
I suggest again that you re-do 
=bank loans. no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane= . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do will, 
=AO make <=pan>suydam=/span> executor , with Barry, and john as back up. =AO pay 1 million a year for executor role. 
get rid of Judy=/span> Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amount= to kids at fixed ages. put more 
protections in for AlexVictoria. , distribute some money to k=ds let them make decisions. , decide art division with 
c=ildren in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose 
advisers - rick=bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. Halperin ha= a conflict that should be 
addressed., A strategy of the use of art =hould be implemented.. you have tax consultants it consultant=. plane 
operation consultant.. boat consultants. architects, =ighting , art, legal, . foundation , deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize 
i=vestments. cash flow. reporting, gaming disclosures. foreign, gift. = prepare tax projections for 15 and 16, . deal with 
neg basis ( tufts gain= debt financed. art partnership, pledges. sell stock , art, de=l with phaidon debt.=C2 athene,? 
=income , capital , foreign , exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbo=nd issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? 
=AO terminations. control. , qualified dividends. corporate tolls, =AO inversion rules. , grat</=pan> issues, short swing 
and other sec disclosures, I s=ill think you might consider a Rothshcildr/span> bank transaction they have 150 b and 
=AO a distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service. deal with UK visa 
issue sooner rather than=later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , complex =A0 2 billion in taxes on 
transaction. ?! 
=C2 the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept,=C2 we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon<=span> payout., then only after weeks, 
when=you delayed any detailed discussion of money wanting to give the iss=e a thoughtful response ( which I fully 
understand ) . you uniraterally changed changed our agreement.. 5m would be reserved=for the future ? . and out of 
the remaining 15m ,? i would receive o=Iy a third. ( note : I'm confident that both the deb= , and the artspace 
=nvestment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus=C2 ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said 
that i req=ire most people to pay their advisory fee up front so th=t I am assured that I will be properly compensated 
for my work when =trategies are implemented . you may recall that you appeared o=fended and said " are you 
suggesting that i would =o back on my word " I said no , of course not ! you are my clos=st of friends ,but my 
experience is that when amounts get largr, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay 
<=r> 
I included in this letter the email i rent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your ret=rns It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation for a transacti=n of the magnitude to the penny of the one just completed. though 
th= number was great it was clear. When it appeared that the details co=ld now be worked out I was the first to say, it 
is too much money,=C2 however.
