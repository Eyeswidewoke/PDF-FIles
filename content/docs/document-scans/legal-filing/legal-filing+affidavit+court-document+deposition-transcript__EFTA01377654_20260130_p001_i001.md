Although this program is functional, it may prove to be inadequate, increasing the risk of interruptions in our services, which 
could have a material and adverse impact on our business. We do not maintain insurance sufficient to compensate us for the 
potentially significant losses that could result from disruptions to our services. 
Our Square Capital service is subject to additional risks relating to the availability of capital, seller receivables, and 
general macroeconomic conditions. 
Our Square Capital service is subject to risks in addition to those described elsewhere in this prospectus. Maintaining and 
growing our Square Capital service is dependent on third parties to purchase the future receivables related to the Square Capital 
merchant cash advances. If third parties fail to continue to purchase such receivables or reduce the amount of future receivables 
they purchase, then we would have to fund future advances to merchants from our own resources and might have to reduce the 
scale of our Square Capital service. If third parties reduce the price they are willing to pay for these receivables or reduce the 
servicing fees they pay us in exchange for servicing the receivables on their behalf, then the financial performance of Square 
Capital would be harmed. 
Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions could cause some Square Capital sellers to cease operating or to experience 
a decline in their payment processing volume, rendering us unable to obtain the receivables or extending the period of time 
required for us to obtain such receivables. Sellers receiving MCAs are contractually obligated to use Square as their only card 
payment processing service until we have received the agreed-upon fixed amount of receivables. To the extent a seller breaches 
this obligation, the seller would be liable to us for the balance of the receivables. Consistent with the general nature of MCAs, we 
do not otherwise have any economic recourse to the seller in the event that it does not process a sufficient volume of payments 
with us to pay the agreed-upon fixed amount of receivables. 
In addition, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions could also lead to a decrease in the number of sellers suitable for 
Square Capital advances and strain our ability to correctly identify such sellers or manage risk of non-payment or fraud. Similarly, if 
we fail to correctly predict or price the availability of receivables of sellers utilizing our Square Capital service, our business may be 
materially and adversely affected. 
We intend to continue to explore other models and structures for our Square Capital service, including lending and other 
forms of credit. Some of those models or structures would require, or be deemed to require, additional procedures, partnerships, 
licenses, or capabilities that we have not yet obtained or developed. Should we fail to expand and evolve our Square Capital 
service in this manner, or should these new models or structures, or new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations, 
impose requirements on us that are impractical or that we cannot satisfy, the future growth and success of the Square Capital 
service may be materially and adversely affected. 
Our business is subject to extensive regulation and oversight in a variety of areas, all of which are subject to change and 
uncertain interpretation. 
We are subject to a wide variety of local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations in the United States and in 
other countries in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern numerous areas that are important to our business, 
including consumer protection, privacy, labor and employment. immigration. import and export practices, product labeling, 
competition, and marketing and communications practices, to name a few. Such laws and regulations are subject to evolving 
interpretations and application, and it can be difficult to predict how they may be applied to our business,

particularly as we introduce new products and services and expand into new jurisdictions. Any perceived or actual breach of laws 
and regulations could negatively impact our business. It is possible that these laws and regulations could be interpreted or applied 
in a manner that would prohibit, alter, or impair our existing or planned products and services; that could cause us to be subject to 
audits, inquiries, or investigations; that could result in fines, injunctive relief, or other penalties; or that could require costly, time-
