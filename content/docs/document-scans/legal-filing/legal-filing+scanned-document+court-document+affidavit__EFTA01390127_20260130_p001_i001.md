sole discretion of the General Partner (regardless of whether a Qualified Matching Service is available). In 
addition, the constituent documents of the Underlying Fund do not allow for transfers of Interests without 
the prior written consent of the Glendower GP. 
Repayment of Distributions. The Access Fund may be required to repay to the Underlying Fund or to pay 
creditors of the Underlying Fund, as applicable, distributions previously received by it. In addition, the 
Access Fund may be required to pay to the Underlying Fund amounts that are required to be withheld by 
the Underlying Fund for tax purposes. The Access Fund may require Limited Partners to return to the 
Access Fund all or part of any distribution by the Access Fund to the Limited Partners in order to satisfy 
all or any portion of the Access Fund's indemnification and other obligations to the Underlying Fund or 
otherwise. Similarly, Limited Partners may also be required to repay or pay such amount to the Access 
Fund if the Access Fund is unable otherwise to meet its obligations. 
Reinvestment. The Glendower GP has the right to recall capital contributions, including, during the 
investment period of the Underlying Fund (the "Investment Period"), capital contributions applied to an 
investment that has been disposed of within 24 months of such investment and following the termination 
of the Investment Period, an amount equal to any and all distributions made to the limited partners for the 
purpose of finding existing obligations to make contributions or advances in respect of investments and 
any follow-on investments. Accordingly, the Access Fund may be required to make capital contributions 
in excess of its commitment, and to the extent such recalled or retained amounts arc reinvested in 
investments, the Access Fund will remain subject to investment and other risks associated with such 
investments. 
Indemnity Obligation. The Access Fund will be required to indemnify the General Partner, the Investment 
Manager. the administrator and certain of their affiliates and representatives (including any sub-advisor or 
other similar service provider) for liabilities incurred in connection with the affairs of the Access Fund. 
Any such indemnification (and the expenses thereof) will be in addition to the indemnification granted 
under the Partnership Agreement in respect of the Access Fund's indemnity obligations and any 
indemnification granted under the Underlying Fund's governing documents (and the investments of the 
Underlying Fund), including the obligation to return distributions to fund any such Underlying Fund 
indemnification (with the Limited Partners in turn being required to return distributions). The Access 
Fund's indemnification obligations under the Partnership Agreement may be funded by capital calls from 
the Limited Partners or through the return of Distributions previously made to the Limited Partners. A 
Limited Partner's obligation to fund capital calls in respect of the Access Fund's indemnification 
obligations are apart from an Investor's Subscription, and therefore will not be capped. In addition, the 
Access Fund's assets, including any investments held by the Access Fund (including cash or cash 
equivalents), are available to satisfy all liabilities and other obligations of the Access Fund, including 
indemnification obligations. The obligation to fund an indemnification claim will survive the dissolution 
of the Access Fund. 
Multiple Layers of Expenses. The Access Fund and the Underlying Fund each have expenses and 
management costs that will be borne, directly (in the case of expenses and costs of the Access Fund) or 
indirectly (in the case of expenses and costs of the Underlying Fund), by the Access Fund. Further, 
distributions from the Underlying Fund to the Access Fund will be subject to the carried interest of the 
Glendower GP. In addition, certain expenses will be apart from a Limited Partner's Subscription. including 
indemnification expenses and certain other required payments, including transfer expenses, interest 
expenses in connection with subsequent closings, certain tax preparation and other expenses attributable to 
specific limited partners. A Limited Partner's obligation to fund these expenses will not be capped.
