There can be a substantial difference in the tax basis of the purchaser'= tax basis in MFP and IAP and the tax 
basis of the assets held by MFP and IAP, particularly if there is a premium placed on the intangible value =of the 
management team in place, ie goodwill. If MFP and IAP make the Section =54 election whereby the basis of the 
purchaser's partnership =nterest is assigned to the purchaser's proportionate share of assets held =y MFP and IAP, 
thereby giving rise to a tax basis adjustment to all partnership assets. This basis adjustment will apply =olely with 
respect to purchaser, and will have no effect on the remaining interests held by the Founders. . The consideration is 
=pplied to each asset to adjust asset tax basis to equal fair market value. To the extent that consideration exceeds the 
fair value of =he assets, the excess may be considered goodwill under Section 197 which may be amortized over 15 
years by MFP (there is no goodwill created by =IAP). Amortization of Section 197 intangibles will give rise to tax 
deductions by MFP allocable solely to the purchaser and will reduce the aforementioned inside/outside disparity and 
give rise to tax savings at ordinary income tax rates to the purchaser. 
The public in the case of Apollo is Apollo Global Management (AGM) which is a publicly trade partnership. AGM 
holds an interest in IAP =hrough a partnership interest and holds MFP interest through a corporate blocker. The blocker 
ensures that any management company income is taxed to the corporation and that the public owners of AGM receive a 
dividend on any profits earned and =distributed by the blocker. Given the 754 election by Apollo, the =acquisition of a 
portion of the Founder's interest in MFP to gives rise to a Section 197 intangible that provides future =tax benefits of 
amortization deductions. 
The generation and subsequent use of this valuable tax attribute is central to a Tax Receivable Agreement. 
As 
the purchaser =eceives a tax benefit for the use of the tax attribute, i.e. the Section 197 amortization, the purchaser is 
obligated to pay to the Founder's 85% of said tax =enefit. The measurement of tax benefit is based on a "with or 
without"=approach whereby corporate tax is calculated with and without the Section 197 amortization. Apollo make a 
payment under the TRA on or around April 15 following year end. 
Given that the TRA payment arises from the original sale by the founders to =the public, the treatment of the 
TRA payment is considered additional consideration paid by the purchaser to the founder. This gives =ise to an iterative 
calculation that the assets of MFP are stepped up to fair value and any amount of =consideration in excess of fair value 
generates a Section 197 intangible. This additional Section 197 intangible is a tax =ttribute that is then subject to the Tax 
Receivable Agreement. Since payments of consideration are made over two or more tax years, the purchase is an 
installment purchase/ sale that gives rise to the application of Section 483 which treats a portion of an installment 
payment, ie consideration, to be treated as interest income, ie time value approach. While this interest may be 
=educted currently, it is not treated as consideration which gives rise to a basis step-up and thus is not impact the tax 
receivable agreement. 
Given that there was no basis in the Apollo entities by the Founders in 2007 =when the original sale took place, 
there was no purpose to elect installment treatment. The founders have adopted the "open =ransaction" approach 
whereby recognition applies when payments are received or fixed given that the fair market =value of the stream of TRA 
payment obligation cannot be reasonably ascertained at the date of sale. If a "closed =ransaction" approach was 
asserted, there would need to be a valuation of the value of the TRA and immediate income recognition by the 
Founders. In such a scenario, the value of the TRA payments =ould be treated as consideration by Apollo and thereby 
give rise to a portion to be treated as a Section 197 intangible.
