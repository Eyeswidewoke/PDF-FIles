Dear Michael, 
Your chapter reads well and is certainly more than fair about me, given=the general unfairness I've experienced from 
militant atheists and hard-bo=led skeptics. Thanks for being so open-minded. 
My only comments have to do with making a difficult subject more access=ble to your readers. 
1. I'd slow down at the passage about "redness" and spell out=that the brain is dark but we see light' the brain is silent, 
but we hear=the brain contains no pictures, but we see full-blown three-dimensional images. Then open up how a 
neuron works, firing the same=chemical signals as any other cell with small modifications. So how =oes a brain cell, born 
of the same strand of DNA as a stomach o liver cell= think? It seems to me that a brain cell cannot think. 
2. On a basic chemical level, the sugar in a sugar cube or the gl=cose in the bloodstream has no special properties; the 
molecules do not pa=ticipate in mental activity until they enter the brain. You might want to point out this mystery and 
also note that mat=rial monists must show the exact point when molecules exhibit mind-like be=avior. 
3. Freeman Dyson, among other physicists, cites the mind-like behavior =f subatomic particles as they "choose" and 
"decide" wh=t state in the wave-particle duality to exist in. Here's a nice quote from Dyson: 
"It would not be surprising that the =rigin and destiny of the energy in the universe cannot be complete,= understood in 
isolation from the phenomena of life and consciousness--It is=conceivable---that life may have a larger role to play than 
we have imagined..quot; 
"Life may have succeeded against all&=bsp;odds in molding a universe to its purposes. And the design of the inan=mate 
universe may not be as detached from the potentialities of life =nd intelligence as scientists of the 20th century have 
ten=ed to suppose" 
4. You say that choosing between materiali=t monism and consciousness monism isn't the point, but it is. Consciousnes= 
monism or "mind first" must show how mind turns into matter. Ma=erialistic monism or "matter first" must do the 
opposite, demonstrating how matter can produce mind. Even though the &=uot;matter first" crowd are far ahead in 
scientific acceptance, in fa=t we see mind produce matter every time a synaptic gap is crossed by neuro=ransmitters or 
hormones are triggered by experience. A person who is phobic sees a spider and reacts violently at t=e level of stress 
hormones, elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure, =tc. This physical state is entirely produced by a mental 
interpretation th=t a harmless insect is cause for panic. 
5. I'm not sure about how you introduce mo=ism. There are famous Western monists among idealistic philosophers =ho 
are a) not materialists and b) not" Eastern". Since "mon=d" as a philosophical term is associated with Leibnitz, you'll see 
that it refers to an indivisible "substance," which m=y seem materialistic, until you discover that one order of this 
substance =s the soul. 
"The basic order is three-tiered: (1) entelechies or created monads =548), (2) souls or entelechies with perception and 
memory (519), and (=) spirits or rational souls (582). " 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad=logy#The_metaphysics_of_The_Monadology) 
Other Western monists who are definitely n=t materialistic include Spinoza, Hegel, Girdano Bruno, and Schopenhauer.
