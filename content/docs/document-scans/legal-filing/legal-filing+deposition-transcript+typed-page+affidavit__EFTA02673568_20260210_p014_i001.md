other software manufacturers are more inclined to make applications for =Windows than for Apple's operating system. 
If there is to be a standard =computer language--which from the point of view of the public is greatly desirable--it now 
appears that Windows will be the one. But Gates has =to worry that someone will do to Microsoft what Microsoft did to 
Apple. =Apple is designing a new operating system with I.B.M.; it's code-named =Pink, and is expected to appear 
sometime in 1995. 
After a month of E-mail between Gates and me, my hour in his physical presence arrived. As we shook hands, he said, 
"Hello, I'm Bill Gates," and emitted a low, vaguely embarrassed chuckle. Is this the sound one E-mailer makes to another 
when they finally meet in real space? I was aware of a feeling of being discovered. In the front part of Gates' office, we 
sat down at right angles to each other. Gates had on normal-looking clothes--a green shirt with purple stripes, brown 
pants, black loafers. He rocked throughout =our time together. He did not look at me very often but either looked down 
as he was talking or lifted his eyes above my head to look out the =window in the direction of the campus. The angle of 
the light caused the purple stripes in his shirt to reflect in his glasses, which, in turn, =threw an indigo tinge into the dark 
circles around his eyes. 
The emotional boundaries of our encounter seemed to have been much expanded by the E-mail that preceded it: Gates 
would be =angry one minute, almost goofily happy the next. I wondered if he was consciously using our present form of 
communication to express feelings =that E-mail cannot convey. Maybe this is the way lots of people will communicate in 
the future: meet on the information highway, exchange messages, get to know the lining of each other's mind, then 
meet face to face. 
In each other's physical presence, they will be able to eliminate a lot of the polite formalities that clutter people's 
encounters now, and say what they really mean. If this happens, it will =be a good thing about the information highway: 
electronic communication =won't reduce face-to-face communication; instead, it will focus it. 
I had been told not to ask Gates about his marriage, because he didn't want to talk about it, but I was emboldened by 
the familiarity that E-mail had established between us and asked anyway. Gates was silent, rocking gently (I interpreted 
that as a good sign) and staring down at his shoes. "Well, it's a pretty conventional marriage," he said after a while. "I'm 
male, and I'm marrying a female. And there's just two of us. And we plan to have rings on our fingers. And there'll be a 
minister. Or, actually, a priest, I think. Since I'm marrying a Catholic." He giggled. "Pretty standard stuff. In most 
dimensions, including this one, I'm just like everybody else. I found a =girl and fell in love with her. I'm kind of old." As he 
talked, he began to make a peculiar ahhh sound--a sort of rapturous vocalized pause, with a little shyness in it, as if he 
were confiding in me. 
"Some of your competitors are hoping that marriage is going to make =ou spend less time in the office," I said. 
"Yeah, I think ... ahhh ... that's a pretty strange thing. Being married I don't think is that big a change. It did =take up a 
lot of energy and time being single. I think in a way it's more complicated than being married. I mean, marriage has its 
own complexities, but they're different ... ahhh ... and I don't think =timewise they're much different. And I've been 
going out with this person off and on for a number of years, so it's not like the day I get =married it will be, like, whoa, 
wait a minute, she uses curlers to curl =her hair, my God!" 
Gates and his bride are constructing a thirty-five-million-dollar house on the eastern slope of Lake Washington, just 
outside Seattle--a series of five pavilions connected =by underground passageways, with display screens scattered 
throughout the rooms and linked to a central data base containing hundreds of thousands of famous works of art in 
digital form. Gates does not own the art; he owns the right to reproduce the art digitally, and he and his =assistants 
continue to throw museum officials around the world into confusion by offering to buy the digital rights to works in their 
collections. 
"Do you worry that your wealth is going to corrupt you?"
