As of December 31, 2011, these tests revealed that certain long-lived assets, with a carrying amount of 
$20.7 million, needed to be written down to an estimated fair value of $1.4 million, resulting in an 
impairment charge of $19.3 million, which was included in depreciation expense for the fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2011. 
As of December 31, 2010, these tests revealed that certain long-lived assets, with a carrying amount of 
$71.0 million, needed to be written down to an estimated fair value of $60.8 million, resulting in an 
impairment charge of $10.2 million, which was included in depreciation expense for the fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2010. 
The estimation of fair value required quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, 
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are 
observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
Long-Term Debt — For the CMBS loan and the Notes, management's estimate of fair value was 
determined with assistance from an external valuation firm. The carrying value of the RBS loan 
approximates its fair value. For the senior mezzanine loan, the junior mezzanine loan from affiliate, and 
the loan from affiliate, it is not practicable to estimate fair value due to limited market activity and the 
junior mezzanine's and loan from affiliate's related-party nature. These estimated fair values at 
December 31, 2011 and 2010, are as follows (in thousands):

Common Partner Units — At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had 2,239,551 common 
partner units outstanding, of which KUE Management Inc., the Company's general partner, held 
1,464 units and limited partners held the remaining units. 
Profits Participation Limited Partner Units — At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had 
251,164 profits participation limited partner units (PPUs) outstanding. PPUs were issued in conjunction 
with the sale of units to investors. PPUs are limited to 11% of the aggregate number of total units 
outstanding. KULG LLC (KULG) is entitled to hold 9/11ths and employees and others are limited to 
2/11ths of the PPUs. KULG held 224,164 PPUs; employees and others held 27,000 PPUs. The PPUs 
entitle the holders to share in increases in value of the Company, upon distributions, liquidation, or sale 
of the Company, based on the number of PPUs they hold divided by the total number of common partner 
units and PPUs outstanding. 
For the PPUs held by employees and others, this sharing percentage applies to the Company's value in 
excess of the value of total contributions. The PPUs held by KULG participate after the value of the 
Company is in excess of the total value of contributions, plus 8% per annum. 
PPUs held by employees and others vest over a four-year period, and will result in compensation 
expense to the extent that the Company's value increases to a level where amounts are due to the 
holders. PPUs held by KULG were fully vested upon issuance. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, no 
amounts were due under either of these PPU arrangements.
