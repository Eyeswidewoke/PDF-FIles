IPI Regional Insights 
July 2014 
The International Peace Institute's (IPI) Regional Insights covers select regional and thematic 
developments based on information from a variety of sources. It draws on the research of IPI 
experts and is provided exclusively to major donors and members. Each monthly issue covers 
challenges and opportunities related to international peace, security, and development. 
Africa 
African Union Summit: At the recently concluded AU summit in Equatorial Guinea, African heads of 
state adopted the "Protocol on Amendments to the Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of 
Justice and Human Rights," granting themselves and other undefined senior officials immunity from 
prosecution for a range of crimes including crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide. This 
action is purely symbolic, as the African Court of Justice is a long way from being established and it 
does not impact the International Criminal Court's (ICC) capacity to investigate and prosecute African 
or other state leaders for these crimes. Nonetheless, it is a major setback for the goal of justice in 
Africa, a rebuke to the recent decision of the Assembly of States Parties to the ICC not to grant 
immunity to heads of state, and a rejection of the fundamental principles underlying the African 
Union Constitutive Act. The media, NGOs, and think tanks in Africa have condemned this action as 
reflecting the self-interest of heads of state while disregarding the crimes perpetrated against tens of 
thousands of Africans in recent and ongoing conflicts. The issue is likely to arise again at the next 
session of the ICC Assembly of States Parties later this year. 
Mali: The Malian government and Tuareg rebel groups held peace talks in Algiers on Wednesday, July 
16th, after an exchange of prisoners helped to get the negotiations started. The talks, seen as a major 
breakthrough by regional and international partners, included representatives from the United 
Nations, European Union, African Union, and the Economic Community of West African States. While 
the talks themselves represent a breakthrough, an agreement reached between the government and 
Tuaregs in Algiers may not necessarily carry weight with the diverse and fragmented rebel groups in 
northern Mali. 
South Sudan: The European Union has imposed sanctions in the form of a travel ban and asset 
freezes on army commander Santino Deng and rebel chief military leader Peter Gadet, for obstructing 
the peace process and their roles in committing atrocities in the past six months of fighting in South 
Sudan. These sanctions, which are intended to send a strong message to both President Salva Kir and 
opposition leader Riek Machar are a sign of the growing frustration on the part of international 
partners and regional leaders with the continuing violence and the inability of the parties to find a 
resolution to the conflict. Calls for sanctions from the United Nations Security Council could be an 
uphill battle given that China and Russia have expressed reservations regarding sanctions. In addition,
