Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control 
Executive Change of Control and Severance Agreements 
We have entered into a change of control and severance agreement with each of our named executive officers, which 
agreement provides for the severance and change of control benefits described below. Each change of control and severance 
agreement supersedes any existing agreement or arrangement the named executive officers may have with us that provides for 
severance and/or change of control payments or benefits. 
Under each change of control and severance agreement, if the named executive officer remains employed by us or any of 
our subsidiaries through a "triggering event" (as defined in our 2009 Plan), the vesting of any of his or her options (or unvested 
shares acquired through the early exercise of options) that were outstanding when the change of control and severance agreement 
was entered into will be accelerated as if he or she had been employed for an additional 12 months following such triggering event. 
If the named executive officer's employment is terminated by us without "cause" or by reason of death or "disability" (as such 
term are defined in his or her change of control and severance agreement), in either case, outside the Change of Control Period 
(as defined below), he or she will be eligible to receive the following payments and benefits if he or she timely signs and does not 
revoke a release of claims: 
• a lump-sum payment equal to 75% of annual base salary (as of immediately before his or her termination); 
• a lump-sum payment equal to a pro rata portion of the annual bonus that the named executive officer would have earned 
for the year of his or her termination if he or she had remained employed until eligible to receive the bonus; 
• a taxable lump-sum payment equal to nine months of the monthly COBRA premium required to continue health insurance 
coverage for the named executive officer and his or her eligible dependents regardless of whether the named executive 
officer elects COBRA coverage; and 
• in the event of a termination due to death or disability only, fully accelerated vesting and exercisability of all outstanding 
equity awards, and, with respect to equity awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting 
criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels. 
If, within the three-month period before or after the 12-month period following a change of control (such period, the Change 
of Control Period), the named executive officer's employment is terminated by us without cause or by reason of death or disability
