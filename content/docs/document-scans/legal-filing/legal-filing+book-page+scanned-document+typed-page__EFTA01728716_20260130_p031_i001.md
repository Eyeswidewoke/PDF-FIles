Search Warrants 
The major law-enforcement problem with the use of search warrants in child-
sexual-victimization cases is that they are not obtained soon enough. In many 
cases investigators have probable cause for a search warrant but don't know it. 
Because evidence can be moved, hidden, or destroyed so quickly, search warrants 
should be obtained as soon as legally possible. Waiting too long and developing, 
in essence, too much probable cause also might subject investigative agencies td • 
criticism or even lawsuits charging that this delay allowed additional victims 
to be molested. This is a potentially significant problem in sexual-exploitation 
cases. "What did you know and when did you know it" can become a big issue in 
defending an investigative response as correct and reasonable. Investigators often 
do not recognize the value and significance of child erotica, pedophile parapher-
nalia, and other collateral evidence. (See the chapter titled "Collection of Child 
Pornography and Erotica" beginning on page 61.) 
As previously discussed the expertise of an experienced investigator and well-
documented behavior patterns of preferential sex offenders sometimes can be 
used to add to the probable cause, expand the scope of the search, or address the 
legal staleness problem of old information. Such "expert" search warrants should 
be used only when necesnary and there is probable cause to believe the alleged 
offender fits the preferential pattern of behavior. 
Physical Evidence 
Physical evidence can be defined as objects that corroborate anything a child 
victim did, said, saw, heard, tasted, smelled, drew, or had done to him or her. It 
can be used to prove offender identity and type and location of activity. It could 
be items such as sheets, articles of clothing, sexual aids, lubricants, fingerprints, 
and documents. It also could be an object or sign on the wall described by a 
victim. If the victim says the offender ejaculated on a doorknob, ejaculate on the 
doorknob becomes physical evidence if found. If the victim says the offender 
kept condoms in the nightstand by his bed, they become physical evidence if 
found. An adult-pornography magazine with a page missing as described by the 
victim is physical evidence. Satanic occult paraphernalia is evidence if it corrobo-
rates criminal activity described by the victim. Positive identification of a subject 
through deoxyribonucleic add (DNA) analysis of trace amounts of biological evi-
dence left on a child or at a crime scene might result in a child victim not having 
to testify because the perpetrator pleads guilty. 
Child Pornography and Child Erotica 
Child pornography, especially that produced by the offender, is one of the most 
valuable pieces of corroborative evidence of child sexual victimization that any 
investigator can have. Many collectors of child pornography do not molest chil-
i dren, and many child molesters do not possess or collect child pornography. 
Investigators should, however, always be alert for it. Child erotica can be defined 
as any material, relating to children, that serves a sexual purpose for a given indi-
vidual. Some of the more common types of child erotica include drawings, 
fantasy writings, diaries, souvenirs, letters, books about children, psychological 
books on pedophilia, and ordinary photographs of children. It must be evaluated 
in the context in which it is found using good judgment and common sense. 
Child erotica is not as significant as child pornography, but it can be of value. (See
