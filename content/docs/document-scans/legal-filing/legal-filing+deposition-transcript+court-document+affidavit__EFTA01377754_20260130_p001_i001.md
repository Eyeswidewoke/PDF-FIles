S-I/A 
with respect to unvested shares of restricted stock, unless the administrator provides otherwise. Shares of restricted stock that do 
not vest are subject to our right of repurchase or forfeiture. 
RSUs. 
RSUs may be granted under our 2015 Plan. An RSU is an award that covers a number of shares of our Class A 
common stock and that may be settled upon vesting by the issuance of the underlying shares or payment in cash or a combination 
of shares and cash. Subject to the provisions of our 2015 Plan, the administrator will determine the terms and conditions of RSUs, 
including the vesting criteria (which may include accomplishing specified performance criteria or continued service to us) and the 
form and timing of payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator, in its sole discretion. may accelerate the time at 
which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. 
Performance Units. Performance Shares, and Performance Awards. 
Performance units, performance shares, and 
performance awards may be granted under our 2015 Plan. Performance units, performance shares, and performance awards are 
awards that will result in a payment to a participant only if performance goals established by the administrator are achieved or the 
awards otherwise vest. The administrator will establish organizational or individual performance goals or other vesting criteria in its 
discretion, which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and/or the value of performance units, 
performance shares, and performance awards to be paid out to participants. After the grant of a performance unit, performance 
share, or performance award, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance criteria or other vesting 
provisions for such performance unit, performance share, or performance award. Performance units will have an initial dollar value 
established by the administrator on or prior to the grant date. Performance shares will have an initial value equal to the fair market 
value of our Class A common stock on the grant date. Performance awards will have threshold, target, and maximum payout 
values established by the administrator on or prior to the grant date. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned 
performance units, performance shares, or performance awards in the form of cash, shares, or some combination thereof. 
Outside Directors. 
Our 2015 Plan provides that all outside (non-employee) directors will be eligible to receive all types of 
awards (except for incentive stock options) under our 2015 Plan. In connection with this offering, we have implemented a formal 
policy pursuant to which our outside directors are eligible to receive equity awards under our 2015 Plan. In order to provide a 
maximum limit on the awards that can be made to our outside directors, our 2015 Plan provides that in any given fiscal year, an 
outside director will not be granted awards under our 2015 Plan having a grant-date fair value greater than $1,000,000, but that in 
the fiscal year that an outside director first joins our board of directors, he or she may be granted awards under our 2015 Plan with 
a grant date fair value of up to 52,000,000. The grant-date fair values will be determined according to GAAP. The maximum limits 
do not reflect the intended size of any potential grants or a commitment to make grants to our outside directors under our 2015 
Plan in the future. 
Non-Transferability of Awards. 
Unless the administrator provides otherwise, our 2015 Plan generally does not allow for the 
transfer of awards, and only the recipient of an award may exercise an award during his or her lifetime.

Certain Adjustments. In the event of certain changes in our capitalization as set forth in our 2015 Plan, to prevent 
diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits available under our 2015 Plan, the administrator will adjust the 
number and class of shares that may be delivered under our 2015 Plan and/or the number, class and price of shares covered by 
each outstanding award, and the numerical share limits set forth in our 2015 Plan in such a manner as it deems equitable. 
Dissolution or Liquidation. 
In the event of our proposed liquidation or dissolution, the administrator will notify participants as 
soon as practicable and all awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction. 
Merger or Change in Control. 
Our 2015 Plan provides that in the event of a merger or change in control, as defined under 
our 2015 Plan, each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator determines, except that if a successor corporation or its 
parent or subsidiary does not continue any outstanding award in accordance with the terms of our 2015 Plan, then such award will 
fully vest, all restrictions on such award will lapse, all performance goals or other vesting criteria applicable to such award will be 
deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, and such award will become fully exercisable, if applicable, for a specified period prior 
to the transaction. The award will then terminate upon the expiration of the specified period of time. With respect to awards granted 
to an outside director that are continued under the terms of our 2015 Plan, if the service of that outside director is terminated on or 
following a change in control, other than pursuant to a voluntary resignation, his or her stock options. RSUs. and stock appreciation 
rights, if any, will vest fully and become immediately exercisable, all restrictions on his or her restricted stock will lapse and all 
performance goals or other vesting requirements for his or her performance shares and units will be deemed achieved at 100% of 
target levels, and all other terms and conditions met.
