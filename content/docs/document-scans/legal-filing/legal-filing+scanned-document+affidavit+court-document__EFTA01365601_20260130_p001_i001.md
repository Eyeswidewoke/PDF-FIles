Nov US. Foreign Account Tai Compliance Rules 
A U.S. law enacted in 2010 imposes a withholding tax of 30% on certain payments made to the Issuer after 
December 31, 2012, including potentially all interest paid on, and proceeds of sale of, U.S. Collateral Obligations 
not outstanding prior to March 19. 2012. unless the Issuer enters into and complies with an agreement with the IRS 
to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding direct and indirect holders of the 
Securities. In some cascs, the ability to avoid such withholding tax will depend on factors outside of the Issuer's 
control. 
In addition the law may subject payments on a particular Security (including principal payments) to a 
withholding tax of 30% unless (i) each foreign financial intermediary through which such Security is held enters into 
such an information reporting agreement and (ii) the direct and indirect holders thereof supply the Issuer and each 
foreign financial intermediary through which such Security is held, if any, with information necessary to comply 
with such information reporting agreements. The Issuer intends to enter into an appropriate information reporting 
agreement with the IRS as discussed above. Each holder of Securities will be required to provide the Issuer and the 
Trustee with information necessary to comply with such information reporting agreements as discussed above, and 
holders that do not supply required information may be subjected to punitive measures, including forced transfer of 
their Securities. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will be effective, and that the Issuer and 
holders of the Securities will not be subject to the noted withholding taxes. The imposition of such taxes could 
materially affect the Issuer's financial ability to make payments on the Securities or could reduce such payments.
