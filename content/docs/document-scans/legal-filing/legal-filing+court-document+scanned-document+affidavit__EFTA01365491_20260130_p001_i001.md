(iii) 
directing, as applicable, the release of any Collateral Obligation to be 
delivered pursuant to such Securities Lending Agreement. 
(c) 
Whenever a loan of a Collateral Obligation is made by the Issuer to a Securities 
Lending Counterparty under a Securities Lending Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.4, the 
lien of the Trustee in such Collateral Obligation Granted by the Issuer shall, immediately prior to 
such loan, be released (with no further action required on the part of the issuer or the Trustee). 
(d) 
Subject to Section 6.1(c)(iv), the Trustee shall be authorized to acknowledge any 
Securities Lending Agreement (or to enter into any related account control agreement, collateral 
agreement or any similar agreement) at the instruction of the Investment Manager on behalf of 
the Issuer and to perform in accordance therewith, and to make delivery and accept delivery and 
return (directly or through a custodian or intermediary) of any collateral pursuant thereto, or 
pursuant to such instruction as shall be provided by the Investment Manager in connection 
therewith and to take any actions and exercise any rights and remedies under any such Securities 
Lending Agreement (and any related account control agreement, collateral agreement or any 
similar agreement) as the Investment Manager may instruct; provided, however, that the Trustee 
shall not be under any obligation to enter into any Securities Lending Agreement and without 
specific instructions from the Investment Manager, shall not be under any obligation to 
acknowledge any Securities Lending Agreement (or to enter into any account control agreement, 
collateral agreement or any similar agreement), or to deliver or receive any collateral pursuant 
thereto, without specific written instruction of the Investment Manager. The Investment 
Manager shall provide written instructions to the Trustee with respect to the administration of 
any such Securities Lending Agreement (and any account control agreement, collateral 
agreement or any similar agreement) including, without limitation, with respect to any default 
and the exercise of rights and remedies thereunder, as the Trustee may reasonably require. Any 
instruction by the Issuer or Investment Manager to the Trustee with respect to any Securities 
Lending Agreement (and any related account control agreement, collateral agreement or any 
similar agreement), the lending or return of Collateral Obligations thereunder, the posting of 
collateral thereunder or other matters concerning the administration thereof or exercise of rights 
or remedies thereunder, shall contain such information as the Trustee reasonably may require to 
enable it to perform and carry out the terms thereof. In connection with any such instruction by 
the Investment Manager, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely upon an Officer's 
certificate of the Investment Manager to the effect that such Securities Lending Agreement, any 
related agreement, and the Securities Lending Counterparty thereunder, is each in compliance 
with the requirements of this indenture. The acknowledgement of any Securities Lending 
Agreement (or execution of any account control agreement, collateral agreement or any similar 
agreement) by the Trustee shall not cause, or be deemed to imply, any responsibility of 
evaluation on the part of the Trustee for the sufficiency, validity or adequacy of the terms 
thereof. Nothing herein shall be construed to cause the Trustee to have any fiduciary duties to 
any Securities Lending Counterparty. 
So long as any Collateral Obligation is on loan pursuant to a Securities Lending 
Agreement, (i) the Trustee shall have no liability for any failure or inability on its part to receive 
any information or take any action in respect of such Collateral Obligation by reason of its being 
on loan (including without limitation, any failure to take action in respect of a notice of 
redemption, consent solicitation, exchange or tender offer or similar corporate action) and (ii)
