We're trying to make it very easy for our clients to understand and explain to others what they're 
doing. I have a simplistic notion of what caused this crisis and it's also a very basic matter. I don't 
think it was smart people who caused it, who came up with structured transactions that nobody 
understood or that there was deception abroad. I think it was that the most basic underwriting 
standards went out the window. 
It's sort of an interesting thing. I'm of an age that my parents lived through the depression. 
Although we had a good life and everything was fine, somehow it got into our heads that you 
don't buy things you can't afford. 
When you have people who are borrowing money that they know they can never pay back offered 
to them by those who don't even require basic documentation--and then manage to get not only a 
100% mortgage, but also a 25% equity loan, what should we expect? What then happens is that 
the bad debts are re-packaged; but, if sound investments had been syndicated, there would have 
been no crisis. Home truths had been ignored. 
TAB: On the product or business side, do you see any new opportunities that could be pursued? 
Lighte: I think that the opportunities that are being pursued have to do with the flight to quality 
now. I think once again, people are terribly interested in our risk profile. How do we do our 
business. Sure, they read the newspapers, but they also really want to know why are you different 
from the banks that have gotten into more trouble. 
So, we explain it to them. We explain our obsession with risk management and credit. All of these 
onerous procedures that drove us mad for years now make us superstars. So, if we stick to our 
knitting in a very basic way, we will prevail and clients will come to us for our products and our 
process. 
TAB: There was some rumour about a possible retail partnership between J.P. Morgan and China 
Everbright Bank. 
Lights: There is always a lot in the ether. After all, we did Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. 
There are always discussions underway on many fronts; and I think it should be that way. 
TAB: You mentioned Jamie Dimon's recent visit. I'm wondering, for the bank here in China, how 
is it coordinating with the Asia Pacific office in Hong Kong and with the headquarters in New 
York? How is that occurring? Has it changed much at all? 
Lighte: This particular event was occasioned by J.P. Morgan's annual International Council 
meeting held in Shanghai. Its members include Tony Blair, Henry Kissinger, George Schultz, Lee 
Kuan Yew, Gao Xi-qing and many other prominent people from government and industry alike. 
After the session, the Bank's operating Committee was then scheduled to meet in Hong Kong. 
Frankly, there were bets on. In light of the crisis, would they all come? For all of those people to 
be out of New York at such a time....The pessimists lost their wagers. Not only did Jamie come, 
but so did the Operating Committee! What a true and public demonstration of J.P. Morgan's 
commitment to China! As if the top of the house can come during such times, I certainly can 
count on them in the future.
