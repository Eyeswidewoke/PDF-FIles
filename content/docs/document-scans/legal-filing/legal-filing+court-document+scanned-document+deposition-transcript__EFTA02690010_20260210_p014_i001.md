case to reflect the true value thereof;

any other organised market will be valued on the basis of the last known price, unless this price is not

estimated in good faith by the General Partner; 
(e) 
unlisted securities or securities not traded on a stock exchange or any other regulated market as well as 
listed securities, or securities whose quoted price is, in the opinion of the General Partner, not

interest of the Company and its Shareholders.

such valuation better reflects the fair value of any asset or liability of the Company in compliance with

Company can rely on such deviations as approved by the Company for the purpose of the net asset value 
calculation.

converted at the mid-market conversion rate between the Reference Currency and the currency of denomination 
as at the Valuation Date.

all loans and other indebtedness for borrowed money (including convertible debt), bills and accounts 
payable;

for commitment for such loans and other indebtedness);
