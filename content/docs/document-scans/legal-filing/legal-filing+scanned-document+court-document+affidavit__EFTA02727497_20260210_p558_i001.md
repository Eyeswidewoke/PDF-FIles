Hyperion Air, LLC S76D37526PAP 
3. Identification and Condition of Components upon Commencement of Agreement — At 
the time of signature of this Agreement or any amendment to this Agreement, for each 
Component installed on a Helicopter, Customer shall identify the serial number and time since 
new and time since overhaul (if the Component was previously overhauled) by completing the 
table set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto. Customer represents and warrants that the 
information contained in Exhibit A attached hereto is correct and that the Components are in 
good working condition with no known defects. Upon request, Customer shall provide copies 
of the Component log cards for Sikorsky's review. Sikorsky may refuse coverage for a 
Component if, in its sole discretion, such Component has not been used or maintained in 
accordance with the terms or conditions of this Agreement or a preceding PAP agreement. 
4. Use, Operation and Maintenance of Components - Customer shall use Components solely 
for the operation of a Helicopter covered under this Agreement. Customer shall obtain 
Sikorsky's written approval prior to removal of a Component from a PAP-covered Helicopter 
and installation of such removed Component into any other helicopter, whether or not such 
helicopter is covered by this Agreement. 
Customer further covenants that: (a) Components and other parts and equipment for the 
applicable Helicopter shall be properly installed; (b) the Components and the applicable 
Helicopter shall be operated and maintained in accordance with the then-current 
recommendations or instructions of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, as contained in its 
maintenance manuals, operating instructions, Alert Service Bulletins or as otherwise stated in 
writing by a duly authorized representative of Sikorsky or Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation; (c) 
Components shall not be repaired or overhauled by anyone other than Sikorsky without 
Sikorsky's prior written authorization; and (d) a Helicopter shall not be used for any service 
other than transport, including but not limited to for Repetitive External Lift, which results or 
may result in substantially greater wear and tear of any Component than that which occurs on 
Components under standard transport operating conditions. 
5. Metal Contamination - Customer shall immediately report Component failure due to metal 
contamination to Sikorsky, and shall comply with Sikorsky's requests for supporting data 
and/or samples. 
6. Removal of Components - Customer shall not remove a Component from a Helicopter prior 
to its TB0 without prior authorization from a Sikorsky Field Service Representative. 
7. New Helicopter Warranty Waiver for S-76D", Helicopters — In the case of a S-76DTM 
model helicopter, with respect to any Component installed at the time of acceptance of the 
Helicopter from Sikorsky or its affiliate, Customer waives the original helicopter warranty set 
forth in the Helicopter's sales agreement for such Component until such time as this Agreement 
is terminated or expires. In the event that this Agreement is terminated prior to the scheduled 
expiration of the original warranty set forth in such sales agreement, such original warranty for 
each Component will be reinstated and Customer shall be entitled only to the remaining or 
unexpired duration and terms of such original warranty in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the sales agreement. With respect to each Component, the provisions of this 
Agreement, while in effect, operate as a substitute for the original warranty for such
