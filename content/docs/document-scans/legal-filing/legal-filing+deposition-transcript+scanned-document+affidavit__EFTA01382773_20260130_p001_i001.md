Federal Estate Tax 
Class A common stock held by an individual non-U.S. holder at the time of death will be included in such holder's gross estate for 
United States federal estate tax puiposts, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
Information reporting generally will apply to the dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder. and the tax withheld, if any, with hc.µct to such 
dividends. regardless of whether withholding was required. Copies of the information returns reporting such dividends and withholding may also 
be made available to the tax authorities in the country, in which the non-U.S. holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. 
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to backup withholding for dividends paid to such holder unless such holder certifies, on an applicable 
IRS Form W-8, under penalty of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such 
holder is a United States person as dermal under the Code), or such holder otherwise establishes an exemption. 
Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds of a sale of our Class A 
common stock within the United Stati.s or conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless the beneficial owner 
certifies, on an applicable IRS Form W-8, under penalty of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or 
reason to know that the beneficial owner is a United States person as defined under the Code), or such owner otherwise establishes an exemption. 
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding riles may be allowed as a refund or a 
credit against a non-U.S. holder's United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. 
Additional Withholding Requirements 
Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as "FATCA"), a 30% United States federal 
withholding tax may apply to any dividends paid on our Class A common stock, and, for a disposition of our Class A common stock occurring after 
December 31. 2018. the gross proceeds from such disposition. in each case paid to (i) a "foreign financial institution" (as specifically defined in the 
Code) which does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-13BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or 
(y) its compliance (or deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of compliance with an intergovernmental 
agreement with the United States) in a manner that avoids withholding, or (ii) a "non-financial foreign entity" (as specifically defined in the Code) 
which does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or 
(y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United States beneficial owners of such entity (if any). If a dividend payment is both subject 
to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under "—Dividends." the withholding under FATCA may be 
credited against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding these requirements and 
whether they may be relevant to your ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock.
