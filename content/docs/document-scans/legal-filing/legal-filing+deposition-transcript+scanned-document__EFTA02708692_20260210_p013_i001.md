When current Presid=nt Hassan Rouhani and I were leading the Iranian nuclear negotiating team =lmost 10 years ago, 
just before the election of former president Mahmoud A=madinejad, I presented a proposal to our Western 
counterparts that contained an array of measures designed by i=dependent, non-Iranian scientists to provide assurances 
that our nuclear p=ogram would remain forever peaceful. 
Prodded by the Bush=administration, however, our counterparts demanded that we abstain from en=ichment until at 
least 2015, effectively killing the chances of a deal. Th=ir mistaking our constructive engagement for weakness, and 
opting for pressure and sanctions to gain concessions, l=d to a change in Iran's position, both by the ballot box in the 
2005 pre=idential election and the subsequent expansion of Iran's peaceful nuclea= activities. 
As we approach 2015= the outcome of past maximalism and obsession with sanctions is clearly ev=dent. In the past 10 
years, Iran has gone from 200 to 20,000 centrifuges, =ur enrichment capacity has risen from 3.5 to 20 percent and the 
Arak heavy-water research rea=tor <http://www.theguardian.com/wor=d/2014/apr/19/iran-arak-nuclear-plant> is less 
than a year from being commissioned. 
Nobody can rewind t=e clock. Sacrifices have been made. Capabilities are vastly different. Knorledge and expertise have 
been attained. None of this can be wished or nego=iated away. 
Today, President Ro=hani and I are back at the negotiating table, and our commitment to constr=ctive engagement has 
not changed. We are willing to provide assurances of =he exclusively peaceful nature of our nuclear program. Our 
proposed measures are serious and would make a real d=fference. But we will not abandon or make a mockery of our 
technological a=vances or our scientists, nor would it be prudent or serve the interest of=nuclear nonproliferation to 
expect us to do so. 
And we have already=delivered. Within 100 days of my being appointed as Iran's nuclear negot=ator, the first nuclear 
agreement in a decade was concluded with the P5-I=;1. The International Atomic Energy Agency has verified that we 
have kept up our end of the bargain. Furthermore, the=cooperation we now extend to the IAEA has been recognized as 
the best in y=ars. We are prepared to maintain this trajectory. 
It would be tragica=ly shortsighted if illusions were to again derail progress toward a histor=c achievement. There will be 
no better time to put an end to the unnecessa=y nuclear crisis than now, when all sides have much to gain and before 
the window of cooperation and pragmatic=reason closes. 
Excuses for once ag=in torpedoing a deal, which can change the shape of our region, can certai=ly be found. Prominent 
among them is the myth of "breakout." For years= small but powerful constituencies have irrationally advanced the idea 
that Iran can produce enough fissile materi=l for a bomb in months. 
While reaching a re=listic deal is the best available option for the West to prevent such a re=ote possibility, it may be 
instructive to take that phobia at face value. =et's put it to a logical test. If Iran ever wanted to break out, all IAEA 
inspectors would have to be expelled fr=m the country. Iran's program would then have to be reconfigured to 
make=weapons-grade fissile material, which would have to be converted to metal,=be molded into the shape required 
for a bomb and undergo countless other complex weaponization processes. No=e of these capabilities exist in Iran and 
would have to be developed from =cratch. This would take several years — not a few months. 
Even when Iran had =he time for this, it did not opt for a bomb. Between 2005 and 2013, when i=s relations with the 
West and the IAEA were at rock bottom, Iran had time,=little international constraints, relatively relaxed monitoring and 
enough centrifuges to press ahead toward a bomb. Fu=thermore, Iran had already paid the price of massive, unjust 
sanctions tha= far exceeded those imposed on countries that have developed a bomb. 
Despite all this, w= did not take a single step toward a nuclear weapon. The 16 security organ= behind two consecutive
