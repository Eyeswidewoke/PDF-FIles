The Whitesides Lab 
(DOD); and the Department of Energy (DOE)8. Although the lab consistently attracted funding (see 
Exhibit 10 for data on yearly grant income), Whitesides worried about a funding process that 
undervalued creative ideas: 
We work in a peer review system. The trouble with peer review is that, by definition, a peer 
community is a kind of "averaging" device, and so the peer review process is a very good one 
for taking out bad ideas, and also a very good one for taking out unusual ideas. And the 
unusual category takes out a lot of the stuff that's really interesting and exploratory. As a 
result, one has to deal with a funding mechanism which rewards or supports the research that 
is obviously developmental and "correct." 
A further concern related to the dominance of NIH, which funded about 65% of all academic 
research. Its approach to evaluating research proposals was to convene a panel of experts to rate a 
stack of submissions that, it was believed, favored "conventional wisdom and established 
researchers." Jeremy Knowles9 described one consequence of this approach: 
There are really some frightening trends in the federal government's support. One of them 
has been known for several years and is represented by the disturbing increase in the average 
age of Nth grantees over the last two decades. It seems to me that our method of funding is 
increasingly supporting geriatrics instead of feeding those who take more creative risks, i.e., 
the young. 
Since maintaining funding was so critical to the lab, students and postdocs were often involved in 
writing proposals for grants, an activity that consumed about 20% of the researchers' time, was often 
frustrating, and lacked transparency. Ellis described efforts at NSF (about 20% the size of NIH) to 
mitigate these criticisms: 
NSF funding operates by merit review. Individuals can send us unsolicited proposals in 
areas spanning science and engineering, and we assess proposal strengths and weaknesses by 
sending them out to peer reviewers around the world. 
Our program officers make 
recommendations based on the reviews and share them with the proposer, while protecting 
the identities of the reviewers. The program officer also provides constructive feedback to the 
proposers so that, especially in the case of a declined proposal, the investigator can craft a 
stronger proposal when he or she resubmits. The NSF statistics are somewhat discouraging in 
the sense that for new investigators - individuals who haven't been in the system before - the 
success rate is about 20%. For individuals who have awards and are submitting renewals, the 
success rate is better: In chemistry it's approximately 60% in a good year. Mentoring by 
experienced, successful faculty colleagues like George is an important part of helping 
investigators, particularly individuals who are new to the system; write proposals that can be 
recommended for funding. 
8A 2006 report in Science suggested that the federal governmental agencies that supported university research were requiring 
more stringent controls and audits of their grants and contracts, and gave much lees flexibility to investigators in the conduct 
of research. The government's intent was to hold researchers and their institutions accountable to what was agreed in the 
original proposals (or as formally amended later). This held for which experiments and research topics were pursued as well 
as the allocation of a researcher's time to the project. For example, a 25% time commitment was not restricted to 25% of a 40-
hour work week, but 25% of a researcher's total professional effort, which might be as much as 80 hours for many 
investigators. "U.S. Rules on Accounting for Grants," Selenar, 311 (January 2006): 168-169. 
9 Jeremy Knowles, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard from 1991 to 2002, was a renowned chemist and 
academic leader who had known Whitesides since 1961 when he was a postdoc at Caked% at the time Whitesides was doing 
his doctoral studies.
