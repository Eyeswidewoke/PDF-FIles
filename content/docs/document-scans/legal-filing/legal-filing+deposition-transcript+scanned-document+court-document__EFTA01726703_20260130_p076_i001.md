Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC):We use the Average 
Daily Balance method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by anteing 
the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for each feature (such as Purchase, Cash 
Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (including current transactions). To get the Average Daily 
Balance for each feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid FC from previous 
billing periodsi , (2) add any new transactions, defoits, or fees, (3) subtract any payments or credts, and (4) make any 
appropriate a ustments. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also add an amount of 
Interest equal to the previous days daily balance multiplied by the dally periodic rate for the feature. 
This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for the next day. If this 
balance is negative, ft is considered to be zero. Then, we add yp all the daily balances for the feature for the billing period 
and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average Daily Balance for the feature. For 
ail features except Cash Advances ancf cenain promotions, the Average Daily Balance wit: be considered to be zero if you 
paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the Payment Due Date shown cn that 
statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number of days in the billing period and the 
daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by 
rounding. The trial FC for the billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all features of the Account. This 
method of calculating the Average Daily Balance and FC results in dally compounding of PC. The minimum 
FC for any billingff  rid: in which FC are imposed is $0.50.
