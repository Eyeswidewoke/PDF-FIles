the affected reference entity will be removed from the credit 
default basket. 
Premiums for both credit default options and credit 
default basket options are expressed in points and 
decimals. In order to obtain the aggregate premium for a 
single option, the quoted premium is multiplied by a pre-
Mum multiplier specified by the listing options market. 
ADJUSTMENT OF CREDIT DEFAULT OPTIONS 
Adjustments may be made to the standardized terms 
of outstanding credit default options when certain events 
occur, such as a succession event or a redemption event, 
both of which will be defined by the listing options market in 
accordance with the terms of the reference obligations. 
Adjustments of credit default options will be within the sole 
discretion of the listing options market. Investors should 
familiarize themselves with the listing options market's rules 
and procedures governing credit default option adjust-
ments. The listing option market's rules goveming adjust-
ments of outstanding options may be changed with regula-
tory approval, and the listing options market may have 
authority to make such exceptions as it deems appropriate 
to its general adjustment rules. 
Redemption Event Adjustments. A redemption event 
occurs when reference obligations of a reference entity are 
redeemed (or paid in lull) by, or on behalf of, the issuer. In the 
case of all types of credit default options, if only some of the 
reference obligations are redeemed, the option is ordinarily 
adjusted such that the remaining reference obligations are 
the reference obligations for the option and no other adjust-
ment will ordinarily be made. If all of the reference obliga-
tions of a reference entity are redeemed and there are other 
debt obligations of the reference entity that the listing 
options market deems appropriate to specify as successor 
reference obligations, then they will be substituted as the 
reference obligations. If. however, all of the reference obliga-
tions of a reference entity are redeemed and there are no 
other debt obligations of the reference entity that the listing 
options market deems appropriate to specify as successor 
reference obligations for the reference entity (a complete 
redemption), then the adjustment will depend upon whether 
or not there are other reference entities for the options. 
Adiustment of credit default options for a complete 
redemption. If there is a complete redemption affecting a 
credit default option, the option will cease trading on the 
date that the redemption event is confirmed by the listing 
options market. Expiration of the option will be accelerated 
to a specified number of days following the confirmation 
date of the redemption, and the option will expire unexer-
cised if, prior to such expiration, no credit event is confirmed 
to have occurred prior to the effective date of the redemption 
event. 
EXAMPLE: Company XYZ is the reference entity for a 
credit default option contract and its 8% May 15, 2022 bond 
issue is the only reference obfigation. During the life of the 
option. Company XYZ redeems the 8% May 15, 2022 bond 
issue and there are no other obligations of Company XYZ
