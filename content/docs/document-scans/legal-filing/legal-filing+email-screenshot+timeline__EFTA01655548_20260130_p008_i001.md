done by that particular artist. Phone records later revealed Greene maintained a Reddit account that followed 
"bodymods" and "scarification" forums. According to the article, Greene allegedly paid a body modification artist 
$500 to fake her own assault, which included inflicting cuts and wounds, and she manipulated FBI agents by 
reporting the incident as a real attack. The article noted that she could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty 
and has been released on $200,000 bond after her first court appearance. Additional reporting was provided by

Continued Reporting: DOJ, Halligan Slam Judge in Comey Case Following Hearing 
ABC News (11/20, Mallin) reported that the Department of Justice initially stated that the full grand jury did not 
review the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, but later reversed this claim, saying the grand jury did 
vote on the two-count indictment. According to the article, the reversal came after Comey's attorney, Michael 
Dreeben, argued that the issue with the grand jury indictment required the judge to throw out the case. The article 
noted that the case against Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to Congress, will continue, with 
the DOJ maintaining that the indictment was properly reviewed by the grand jury. Additional reporting was

Continued Reporting: An Bt-Olympian, a Violent Drug Ring and a $15 Million Reward 
The Washington Post (11/20, Bieler) reported that Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder, is 
wanted by federal authorities for allegedly leading a violent, transnational drug ring and ordering the murder of a 
witness. According to the article, a reward of $15 million is being offered for information leading to his arrest 
and/or prosecution, with Wedding believed to be residing in Mexico. Wedding competed for Canada in the 
snowboarding parallel giant slalom at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, where he finished 24th. On 
Wednesday, Director Patel described Wedding, 44, as "a modern-day iteration" of the notorious drug 
kingpins Pablo Escobar and Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman. The first person featured on the FBI's list of 10 most 
wanted fugitives, Wedding has a reward amount at least three times higher than anyone else in that group. "Ryan 
Wedding's athletic drive snowballed into a life of violence," an official with the FBI's Los Angeles field office said 
Wednesday in a statement, "and, instead of conquering mountains, he mastered a deadly drug distribution 
enterprise and will continue to order murders while he enjoys protection by his cartel associates and others.

Continued Reporting: Fugees Rapper Pras Michel Sentenced To 14 Years In Prison Over Illegal Donations 
To Obama Campaign 
The Associated Press (11/20, Kunzelman) reported that Grammy-winning Fugees rapper Prakazrel "Pras" Michel 
was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison after being convicted of illegally funneling millions in foreign donations 
to Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. According to the article, Michel was found guilty on 10 counts—
including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered foreign agent—with prosecutors arguing that he "betrayed his 
country for money;' while the defense called the sentence disproportionate and vowed to appeal. The article 
noted that Michel obtained over $120 million from Malaysian financier lho Low, used straw donors to route funds 
to Obama's campaign, attempted to interfere with a Justice Department investigation, tampered with witnesses, 
and committed perjury, and that his request for a new trial was denied in 2024. A 2023 press release when Michel 
was convicted quoted Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division: "The defendant 
brazenly conspired to help a foreign national launder millions of dollars in illegitimate campaign contributions 
into the 2012 U.S. presidential election. The FBI and our partners are dedicated to uncovering even the most 
sophisticated schemes which could undermine our fair and transparent democratic process." Additional reporting
