"The lead author is Christopher M. Masi, M.D., 
Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department 
of Medicine at the University of Chicago. He is 
co-founder of Every Block A Village Online, an 
Internet-based community development 
program, and is past president of the Illinois 
chapter of Physicians for a National Health 
Program. He is the current president of the 
Midwest Society of General Internal Medicine 
and has received numerous awards, including a 
Models That Work Award from the United 
States Bureau of Primary Health Care and the 
New Investigator Health Sciences Research 
Award from the Gerontological Society of 
America. With a medical degree, as well as a 
PhD in social service administration, Dr. Masi's 
research focuses on the socioeconomic factors 
underlying health disparities. lie currently has 
two projects, one aimed at developing an 
intervention to reduce loneliness and one focused 
on the role of sex hormones in gender, age, and 
racial differences in cardiovascular disease. He 
is a reviewer for several scientific journals and 
grant-making organizations and has published 
research and reviews on diverse topics, including 
health insurance reform and racial disparities in 
breast cancer and hypertension. 
Human capacity for creativity, 
compassion, and learning is unparalleled in the 
animal kingdom. However, humans reach their 
full potential only when they are socially 
engaged. Lack of social engagement impairs 
creativity and learning, and limits opportunities 
for caregiving and emotional growth. Numerous 
studies have shown that loneliness is also a risk 
factor for illness and premature mortality. 
Because loneliness is increasing in modern 
society, it is critically important to understand 
this condition, as well as strategics to reduce it. 
This essay describes our review of the literature 
regarding loneliness reduction interventions. 
The I7th century English 
philosopher Thomas Hobbes proposed 
that without the organizing structure of 
government, humans would experience 
helium omnimum contra omnes (war of 
all against all) and life would be 
"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and 
short"( I). While this colorful description 
is often quoted, less attention is paid to 
Hobbes' premise that such misery can be 
avoided if humans codify and enforce 
the rules of a civil society. Not everyone 
agrees with Hobbes' views, but history 
is replete with examples of human 
misery when anarchy reigns and of 
relative peace when a social contract is 
observed. A question that philosophers 
continue to debate is whether 
collaboration for mutual benefit is part 
of human nature or whether promotion 
of the self above all others is man's 
primary motivation. In this volume, 
Cacioppo argues that sociality is an 
integral part of human nature. He notes 
that given each child's prolonged period 
of total dependence, survival into child-
bearing age depends entirely upon the 
support and protection of adults, most 
often parents or kin. As a result, those 
who survive long enough to procreate 
pass along genes for nurturing and 
protection, thereby hardwiring a form of 
sociality into our genetic code. 
This protective behavior helps 
ensure that genes within a family are 
passed on to future generations. 
Cooperation among unrelated adults or 
the support and protection of children by 
adults exists beyond kin, as well, 
because these activities also provide 
survival benefit. Examples from early 
human existence include hunting and 
gathering, which are more likely to 
succeed when pursued as a group than 
individually. To these structural benefits
