Special Report: The "Great Accumulation" Is Over: Fx Reserves Have Peaked, Beware QT 
unAelv lc;  orNdie

In the advanced economies holding reserves of any note—Switzerland and 
Japan—we expect no further accumulation in the foreseeable future. The Swiss 
experiment with a permanent exchange rate peg could not be repeated credibly. 
Instead, the SNB stands ready to intervene sporadically against acute safe-haven 
inflows. In order to do so credibly in the future, the SNB will probably seek to 
reduce its balance sheet. The SNB would likely adopt a more gradualist approach 
than the Danish National Bank, which has recently sold the reserves accumulated 
during the post-SNB speculation against its own peg aggressively back into the 
market (Figure 23}.

Medium-term, the SNB faces the predicament of sterilizing the potential 
inflationary pressure created by excess liquidity in the banking system. Indeed, we 
think it is more likely that inflationary pressure will eventually develop on the back 
of excess domestic liquidity than be imported through a weakening exchange rate 
vis-à-vis the Eurozone. Hence, the SNB may choose to sterilize past interventions 
rather than to reverse them by selling EUR/CHF. This means that there would be 
no need to swap non-EUR reserves into EUR; CHF liquidity could be mopped up 
by selling foreign assets in proportion to the current allocation, with only negligible 
ramifications for non-CHF exchange rates such as EURMSD. 
The Bank of Japan is unlikely to intervene directly in the foreign exchange market 
to build reserves in the near future. Even if there is another bout of safe-haven 
driven inflows, the fact that the JPY is trading near undervaluation extremes should 
make BoJ comfortable with accommodating some appreciation from very cheap 
levels (Figure 24). BoJ's last major bout of intervention took place when JPY was 
trading at overvaluation extremes. 
FX and fixed income implications 
The fact that two thirds of global reserves are held in dollars means that a sell-off 
should be bullish USD against other reserve currencies. This is because as central 
banks prop up their currencies against the dollar, they also sell other reserve 
currencies against the USD so as to keep their FX allocations constant. Indeed, 
fluctuations in EURMSD are tightly correlated with changes in global reserves 
(Figure 25), though this correlation naturally captures causality in both directions. 
To start with, we again estimated a simple OLS model of the relationship between 
EUR/USD and global FX reserves to gauge the impact of an unexpected fall in 
global reserves worth $200bn, amounting roughly to Chinese outflows in August 
and not even taking into account more consistent selling by other EM and OPEC
