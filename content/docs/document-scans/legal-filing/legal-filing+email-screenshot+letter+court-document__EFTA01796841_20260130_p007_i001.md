dedicated leader of the opposition. Peres almost never headed the opposition, always=preferring a ministerial 
appointment, once even designing a grotesque syst=m of "rotation" with Yitzhak Shamir, so that he could be in the 
govern=ent. He proposed the ideal of "national unity," a=d greatly devalued the democratic concept of parliamentary 
opposition. For=er Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni ruined her reputation when she refused to =oin Netanyahu in his last 
government. While it is quite true that Livni was an ineffective opposition leader, it=is the very fact of her refusal to join 
the administration and "influenc= it from within" that has provoked most of the criticism by Israeli poli=ical 
commentators. Similar criticism is currently being leveled at =abor Party leader Shelly Yachimovich for stating clearly 
that she would no= join Netanyahu's next government, but would serve as leader of the oppo=ition. There are certainly 
many reasons to criticize Yachimovich, but not her eminently democratic decision to lea= the parliamentary opposition. 
Very few of our political commentators have=ever expressed respect or even understanding for the concept of 
opposition= The most popular political idea in Israel today is national unity—better still, a National Unity Governm=nt: 
"We should all rally round the flag and support our government in th=se critical times." This position, widely espoused, 
echoes what Peres ha= said repeatedly over the years. 
So, although the Peres vision of peace is a positive legacy, he has=also taught us less helpful lessons. The settlements are 
a supremely negat=ve inheritance, but I would argue that the anti-democratic rejection of the concept of a 
parliamentary opposition=is an even more harmful bequest handed down to us by President Shimon Pere=. 
Daniel Gavron, w=o lives in Israel, is a former journalist and the author of nine books, th= most recent of which is Holy 
Land Mosaic, stories of cooperation and=coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians (Rowman & Littlefield, 2008).

India vs. Chi=a vs. Egypt 
Thomas L. Friedman

February 5, 2013 --=New Delhi -- It's hard to escape a visit to India without someone asking=you to compare it to China. 
This visit was no exception, but I think it'= more revealing to widen the aperture and compare India, China and Egypt. 
India has a weak central government but a =eally strong civil society, bubbling with elections and associations at ev=ry 
level. China has a muscular central government but a weak civil society= yet one that is clearly straining to express itself 
more. Egypt, alas, has a weak government and a very weak=civil society, one that was suppressed for 50 years, denied 
real elections=and, therefore, is easy prey to have its revolution diverted by the one gr=up that could organize, the 
Muslim Brotherhood, in the one free space, the mosque. But there is one thing all=three have in common: gigantic 
youth bulges under the age of 30, increasin=ly connected by technology but very unevenly educated. 
My view: Of these t=ree, the one that will thrive the most in the 21st century will be the one=that is most successful at 
converting its youth bulge into a "demographi= dividend" that keeps paying off every decade, as opposed to a 
"demographic bomb" that keeps going off every =ecade. That will be the society that provides more of its youth with the 
e=ucation, jobs and voice they seek to realize their full potential.
