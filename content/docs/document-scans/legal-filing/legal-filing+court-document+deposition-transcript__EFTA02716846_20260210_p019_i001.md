1. =ommodity oil prices are headed only in one direction: Down. Crude oil is not the only commodity that is crashing 
and will continue to do so. =ron ore is on a similar trajectory and for a common reason. Namely, the two-decade-long 
economic boom fueled by the money printing rampage of the world's central banks is beginning to cool rapidly. What 
the old-ti=e Austrians called "malinvestment" and what Warren Buffet once referred=to as the "naked swimmers" 
exposed by a receding tide is now becoming all too appare=t and will get much worse before it gets better. Oil and 
finance have proved to be the only two industries able to tip the world into recession and in my opinion =re likely to 
remain so. For Europe, the United States and China, a lower =a href="http://www.blackhawkpartners.com/geopolitical-
impact-lower-oil-p=ices-personal-assessmentr target="_blank">oil price i= good news. It's essentially a tax cut for 
consumers. The Economist =stimates that the average U.S. motorist could save $800. But economies heavily relia=t on 
oil revenues — Nigeria, Russia and Venezuela for example (0=94 will suffer dearly. So may heavily indebted oil 
companies. For every $1 drop in the pri=e of crude, Venezuela is estimated to lose some $700 million in revenue, maki=g 
it difficult to service debt and fund basic imports. Stagnant global demand=and the rise in U.S. shale oil production are 
two reasons for the fall in crude prices. Saudi Arabia's decision not to cut its production is anothe=; some oil analysts 
believe the Saudis are trying to retain their market share and mak= "nonconventional" sources such as shale less viable. 
Look o=t for major bankruptcies among smaller shale producers. 
2. =SIS will slowly evolve into a more al Qaeda-like organization:Q=A0As it loses gr=und in the Middle East, it'll focus on 
terrorism abroad: This past year saw the proliferation of "lone wolf" attacks that may or may not be=related to ISIS 
chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBMAp7i_171> but were at least inspired by the =roup — car attacks in France 
and Canada, a hostage situation in Australia, and a shoot=ng in Ottawa. This shift in tactics will continue as ISIS 
<http://www.fin=ncialpolicycouncil.org/fpcnew/blogdetails.aspx?id=73/ISIS-in-lraq---Game=changer> loses ground and 
calls on its supporters overseas to launch attacks, as it did th=s past September. 
3. =o nuclear agreement will be struck between the US and Iran: Ayatollah Khamenei won't go all the way on a deal, 
while the P5+1, which will drop its demands on the disclosure of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps role in the 
country's nuclear pr=gram, won't be able to stomach Iran's requirement of a 10-year sunset clause an= an insistence on 
plutonium reprocessing rights. Perhaps the best to be expecte= is an interim deal that further eases sanctions. The 
biggest foreign policy initiative of Obama's second term will basically end in failure, le=ding him to spend a lot more time 
focusing on lower-hanging fruit like rapprochement wi=h Cuba. 
4. =urope's future will depend on its 2015 elections: Cheaper oil just may help Europe dodge another recession. But the 
European Central =ank is not taking any chances. It's planning to take a page from the pl=ybook of the U.S. Federal 
Reserve through a massive program of "Quantitative=Easing" to buy sovereign bonds and shock the European economy 
into life. Most in need =f the firepower: France and Italy. If ECB President Mario Draghi, oil and Ger=any can't drag 
Europe back into growth, the popular mood will continue =o darken, benefiting parties like the anti-immigration, anti-
Europe UKIP in Britain a=d protest party Podemos in Spain. The British vote is in May and few dare to predict the 
outcome. But it seems very likely that one or more of the small=r parties will be involved in coalition negotiations and 
the historic decline=in the vote of the Labour and Conservative Parties will continue. From Finland=to Portugal, elections 
in 2015 will be worth watching as they will dramaticall= shape up the future of Europe in the making. 
5. =ussia's future all in Putin's hands: One of the safest predictions for 2015 is that Ru=sians will have a tough year. 
Besides the sliding oil price, high interest rates =o defend a vulnerable ruble, a shrinking economy and financial 
sanctions (sla=ped on Moscow by the United States and Europe because of Ukraine) are a toxic combination. The 
unanswerable question is how President Vladimir Putin will respond. Will he double down, seeking closer ties with
