US Derivatives Spotlight 
The low forward combined with depressed long-dated implied volatility has 
resulted in the most attractive pricing on long-dated call options in many years. 
As an example of how marked this difference can be, if we compare prices of 
6O-month maturity SPX ATMS calls on 30-Jun-03 and 11-Oct-13. two periods 
with the same implied volatilities but very different forwards, the difference in 
premium is -4.5% (19.1% vs. 14.6%). However, if we compare the option 
prices in terms of the forward (ATMF strikes), then the above mentioned 
spread in the premium disappears. 
Historical performance of long-dated calls 
Option strategies have had bettor risk-adjusted returns vs index performance 
In this section. we look at the historical performance of different long-dated 
call strategies . We compare the performance of the option positions vs. the 
total return on the SPX Index. These backtests focus on SPX 18M and 36M 
options. We chose the 18M maturity for our backtests since many investors 
prefer exchange-listed options to OTC and 18M is the farthest listed maturity 
for which we had consistent data for the SPX. We chose the 36M maturity to 
study the results for even longer-dated options whose vega exposure does not 
decay as rapidly. Our results are largely similar among the two maturities 
studied and include those for 
Calls and call spreads either held to maturity or rolled' after some time 
has passed in the life of the option 
• 
Call diagonals (buy long-dated calls financed by selling 1M calls) 
where the long-dated call is either held to maturity or rolled after some 
time has passed in the life of the option 
We find that: 
• 
Call spreads tend to have the highest risk-adjusted return, even after 
scaling their delta higher to match the initial delta of just the long call 
leg 
• 
Selling 1M 2% annualized premia calls to finance the purchase of 
long-dated calls has had better risk-adjusted performance compared 
with equity or outright calls 
• 
Rolling long-dated calls and call spreads prior to expiry has generally 
(but not always) resulted in higher risk-adjusted returns than holding 
them to expiry 
The table below displays the performance of these strategies in up and down 
market periods. The option strategies have tended to suffer less during market 
downturns but have underperformed in rising markets. This is expected as call 
options have a delta of less than 1- for every $1 change in the SPX, the call 
price will change by less than 1 (by their delta value to be exact), all else equal. 
Backrests are for the Dec-02 to Sep-13 period. We assume a transactions cost of olo vols for outright 
long dated calls and for those calls financed by selling 1M puts. In addition, we assume that the 1M 
options are sold at the bid. We assume a transaction cost of 0 20 vols for cal spreads, which is applied to 
the closer-to-the-money strike. As an example, if the 18M ATM can has a vega or volatility sensitivity of 4. 
then we add 0.3x4=S1 2 to the mid ATM call price as transaction cost. 
The backtests below assume that a long investor replaces his long delta-one position with an equivalent 
notional of calls (that is 1 outright call or spread contract per 100 'shares' in the index). All excess funds 
are invested in short-term Treasury securities. 
4 We roll the long-dated calls alter 1/3rd and 2/3rds of the option's time has passed.
