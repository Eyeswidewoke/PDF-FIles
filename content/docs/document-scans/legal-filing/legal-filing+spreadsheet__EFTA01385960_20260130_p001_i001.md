issues discussed earlier. Consequently, even though the stronger dollar will 
weigh on net exports and help dampen inflation pressures, the drop in energy 
will ultimately be a boon to consumers. Regarding the negative impact on 
energy-related spending and hiring, it is worth noting that employment within 
the transportation sector, arguably the industry best positioned to benefit from 
lower fuel costs, is more than three times larger than the energy sector as a 
percentage of total employment (4.6% vs. 1.4%). The reason we have not 
lowered our GDP forecast for 2015 or beyond is that we believe that dollar 
appreciation will be offset by the stimulus from lower oil prices. Hence, we are 
maintaining our top-down forecast from last December, but the mix of 
underlying output growth has changed —we have factored in a larger drag 
from international trade, but this is largely offset by stronger domestic 
spending 
If the economy is able grow 3% this year, the unemployment rate is likely to 
continue declining at its current pace, which is roughly one percentage point 
per year. Our forecast assumes the unemployment rate will fall to 4.7% by 
yearend, which is well below the Fed's central tendency of 5.0% to 5.2%. This 
further expected tightening in the labor market, which will be accompanied by 
rising hiring and quit rates, should exert upward pressure on labor costs. In 
turn, this should add to policymakers' confidence that inflation will trend back 
toward their 2% target, thus allowing the Fed to begin the process of monetary 
policy normalization at the September 16.17 FOMC meeting. As always, there 
are risks to the economic and financial outlook. 
• 
With respect to output growth, there is a risk that recent dollar 
appreciation exerts a larger-than-anticipated drag on the US economy than 
what we have assumed in our forecast. This would also put further 
downward pressure on goods inflation and likely stay the commencement 
of interest rate normalization a bit longer. 
• 
Another downside risk is that the second-order effects of lower energy 
prices on capital spending and energy-related employment are larger than 
what we currently anticipate. At the same time, the boost to domestic 
spending from lower energy prices may not fully come to fruition if 
households and businesses chose to save a meaningfully greater portion of 
the energy tax cut. 
• 
In terms of the upside risks to growth, the rapid appreciation of the dollar 
may already be reflective of divergent central bank policies. In turn, the 
pace of dollar appreciation may slow significantly over the coming 
quarters, and could even reverse, resulting in less drag on net exports and 
domestic production than we currently assume. 
• 
Another upside risk is the labor market. As the job market continues to 
strengthen and the unemployment rate declines meaningfully further, 
wage and income growth may rise faster than expected, thus providing 
households with even more spending power than we envision. 
• 
The final upside risk pertains to inflation. The aforementioned potential for 
faster wage gains, combined with a more dramatic recovery in energy 
prices relative to our projection — possibly the result of less dollar 
appreciation, stronger overseas growth and substantially less oil 
production — may push headline inflation more quickly back toward the 
Fed's 2% target. With respect to all of the aforementioned risks, this is 
perhaps the one that financial markets are least prepared for.
