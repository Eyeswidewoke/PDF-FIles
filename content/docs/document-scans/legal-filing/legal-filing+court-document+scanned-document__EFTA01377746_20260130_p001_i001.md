Exchange. In making these determinations, our board of directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-
employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in 
determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director, and the 
transactions involving them described in the section titled "Certain Relationships. Related Party and Other Transactions." 
Lead Independent Director 
Our board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines that provide that one of our independent directors should 
serve as our Lead Independent Director at any time when our Chief Executive Officer serves as the

Chairman of our board of directors or if the Chairman is not otherwise independent. Because Jack Dorsey is our Chairman and is 
not an "independent" director as defined in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, our board of directors has 
appointed David Viniar to serve as our Lead Independent Director. As Lead Independent Director, Mr. Viniar will preside over 
periodic meetings of our independent directors, serve as a liaison between our Chairman and our independent directors, and 
perform such additional duties as our board of directors may otherwise determine and delegate. 
Committees of Our Board of Directors 
Our board of directors has established an audit and risk committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating and 
corporate governance committee. The composition and responsibilities of each of the committees of our board of directors are 
described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors. 
Audit and Risk Committee 
Our audit and risk committee is comprised of Messrs. Botha and Viniar and Dr. Summers, each of whom satisfies the 
requirements for independence and financial literacy under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and listing standards of 
the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Viniar serves as the chair of our audit and risk committee, qualifies as an "audit committee 
financial expert" as defined in the rules of the SEC, and satisfies the financial sophistication requirements under the listing 
standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Following the completion of this offering, our audit and risk committee will, among 
other things, be responsible for the following: 
• selecting a qualified firm to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements; 
• helping to ensure the independence and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm; 
• reviewing financial statements and discussing the scope and results of the independent audit and quarterly reviews with

over financial reporting and disclosure controls;

• reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, and developing procedures for 
employees to submit concerns anonymously about questionable accounting or audit matters; 
• reviewing our policies on risk assessment and risk management; 
• reviewing related party transactions; and 
approving or. as required, pre-approving. all audit and all permissible non-audit services and fees, other than de minims
