rely on other reliable data sources and estimates when a company has destroyed or 
discarded the primary evidence in a discrimination case. More than two decades of this 
Court's precedent affirm as much. See Lewis v. Bloomsburg Mills, Inc., 773 F.2d 561 (4th 
Cir. 1985); United States v. County of Fairfax, 629 F.2d 932, 940 (4th Cir. 1980); see 
generally Ramona L. Paetzold & Steven L. Willborn, The Statistics of Discrimination: Using 
Statistical Evidence in Discrimination Cases § 4.03 (2014) (describing the use of proxy 
data when actual data is unavailable or unreliable). In Lewis v. Bloomsburg Mills, Inc., this 
Court approved the use of Census data to establish a hypothetical available pool of black 
female job applicants after a company discarded ["18] employment applications for the 
relevant period. 773 F.2d at 568.e Plaintiffs then compared the "observed" annual rate of 
hires of black women with the "expected" rates based upon the proportional availability of 
black females in the labor pool. Id. We endorsed a similar use of proxy data in United 
States v. County of Fairfax, involving a county government that had destroyed three years 
of employment applications. 629 F.2d at 940. To analyze hiring during that time, plaintiffs 
assumed that the proportion of black and women applicants for those years was the same 
as in the first year for which the county retained records. Id. This Court approved, 
concluding the altemative benchmark was "the most salient proof of the County's labor 
market." Id.' 
6 In Lewis. the company had 'improperly disposed" of the relevant employment applications. uNike the present case where 
there is no direct evidence of any impropriety. 773 F.2d at 568. That fact. however, does not affect our analysis of the workers' 
alternative benchmark. 
7 The dessert cites Men v. Prince George's County, 737 rid 1299. 1306 (4th Cir. 1984), to support its argument that a court 
has wide discretion to reject alternative benchmarks. Post at 110-11. In Men, however, the defendants produced actual 
"applicant flow data" that contradicted the conclusions of r`19] the plaintiffs' statistics that were based on more general 
worktorceflabor market comparisons. Men. 737 F.2d at 1306. Here, like in Lewis, such actual applicant data is unavailable. See 
Lewis, 773 F.2d at 568 (noting that "applicant flow data" was not available). Furthermore, Nucor has not presented any 
alternative statistical study, or shown that data exists that may be more reliable than the alternative benchmark used by the 
workers. 
2. 
(FIN11) The critical question is thus not whether the data used is perfect but instead 
whether it is reliable and probative of discrimination. To that end, a court must examine 
whether any statistical assumptions made in the analysis are reasonable. See Paetzold & 
Willborn, supra, § 4.16. The district court here identified two assumptions made by the 
workers' experts as problematic. 
The district court first questioned the assumption that the job changes described on the 27 
forms represent promotions. See J.A. 10942. As an example of clear factual error 
committed by the court, it quoted at length from the dissent in Brown Ito argue that the 
forms may represent job changes unrelated to promotions. J.A. 10942 (quoting Brown I, 
576 F.3d at 167-68 (Agee, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). The forms cited in 
Judge Agee's original dissent, however, are r20] plainly not among the 27 [' 905] relied 
upon by the workers' experts in constructing the alternative benchmark. Compare J.A. 
10942 (the district court's decertification order quoting the dissent in Brown I), with J.A. 
11005-11032 (copies of the actual change-of-status forms used in the expert analysis).
