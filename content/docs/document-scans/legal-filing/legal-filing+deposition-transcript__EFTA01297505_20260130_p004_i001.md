The named entity was identified publicly in a 30 June 2010 document leaked to Global Witness -- an 
international NGO focused on examining the relationship of natural resources and international trade 
systems with corruption — that detailed Western banking institutions holding Libyan oil money as well as 
investments by the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) in foreign businesses. The NY Times on 26 May 
2011 noted that it had independently verified the leaked document as authentic and described it as a

requiring banks and investment funds to disclose all managed state funds to make it more difficult for 
sanctioned persons or companies to move the proceeds of corruption through the global financial system..
