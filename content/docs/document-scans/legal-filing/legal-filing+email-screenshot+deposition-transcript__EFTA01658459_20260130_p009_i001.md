Politico (8/10, Swan, 4.29M) reports Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Sen. Ron 
Johnson (R-WI) "has issued the first subpoena of his Senate probe into the origins of special 
counsel Robert Mueller's investigation: to FBI Director Christopher Wray." According to Politico, 
the subpoena "demands documents but not testimony. Specifically, it asks for `all documents 
related to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation' - the FBI's counterintelligence probe into 
Russian interference in the 2016 US election." Johnson "also released a lengthy letter detailing 
the origins of his probe and criticizing the reaction it has garnered from media reports and 
Democrats." 
Johnson said on Twitter, "Democrats have initiated a coordinated disinformation campaign 
in an effort to personally attack myself and Sen. @ChuckGrassley, but this will not obstruct our 
investigation. We will find the truth and get answers for the American people." Johnson also 
tweeted, "Today, I have released an open letter regarding the Democrats' combative and false 
comments regarding my committee's investigation." 
The Washington Times (8/10, Sherfinski, 492K) notes the subpoena seeks "all records 
related to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation" and seeks "all records provided or made 
available to the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice for its review." In the 
subpoena, Johnson wrote, "Chairman [Charles E.] Grassley and I will not be deterred by the 
false accusations despicably being made by individuals with strong political biases and 
motivations. ... Our investigation has been, and will continue to be, undertaken with the 
greatest integrity and transparency. We intend to determine and reveal the truth." 
Fox News (8/10, Singman, 27.59M) reports the subpoena states, "This includes, but is not 
limited to, all records provided or made available to the Inspector General of the U.S. 
Department of Justice for its review." The subpoena also demands "all records related to 
requests" to the General Services Administration or the Office of the Inspector General for the 
GSA for "presidential transition records from November 2016 through December 2017." The FBI 
must provide "these documents to the committee by Aug. 20 at 5 p.m. ET, according to the 
subpoena." 
The Daily Caller (8/10, Ross, 716K) says Johnson is "demanding that Wray hand over all 
records that the FBI provided the Justice Department's office of the inspector general for its 
scathing report on Crossfire Hurricane." Johnson also "announced on Monday that he intends to 
subpoena Jonathan Winer, a former State Department official who served as a key liaison 
between dossier author Christopher Steele and State Department officials before the 2016 
election." Winer "arranged a meeting for Steele at Foggy Bottom in October 2016 and was also 
a background source for multiple news articles that contained Steele's unverified allegations of 
collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia." 
CBS News (8/10, Herridge, 3.68M) reports Johnson said he "decided to begin issuing 
subpoenas primarily because of my strong belief that transparency in government is essential 
and that the American people have waited too long for the truth." 
The Washington Post (8/10, Hamburger, 14.2M) reports the FBI "said in a statement it has 
received the subpoena and has `already been producing documents and information to the 
Senate Homeland Security Committee, which are directly responsive to this subpoena. As 
always, the FBI will continue to cooperate with the Committee's requests, consistent with our 
law enforcement and national security obligations." 
The AP (8/10, Tucker) reports in a separate statement "on Sunday, the FBI said it was 
continuing to cooperate with the Judiciary Committee's investigation." The FBI also "said it had 
`surged resources' to be able to continue producing documents to the committee on a rolling 
basis." 
The Federalist (8/10, Osburn, 126K) points out "the letter also addressed a weekend 
Washington Post op-ed by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., in which he claimed that 
`disinformation and deception are gaining a toehold in Congress' as Johnson moves forward 
with an investigation `using documents provided to the senator by the son of a former KGB 
officer Johnson wrote in response, "This is false. ... Not only have we have repeatedly and
