Toward a Revised =osture 
Historians Harold an= Margaret Sprout summarized Britain's bankrupt strategy in an age of dimmi=g empire: Britain had 
"too heavy commitments, depleted capabilities, (and= extreme reluctance to relinquish the role of a Great Power."39 
This aptly describes the United States today. T=e argument here is not to surrender a central, 
leading U.S. global =ole it is to refashion that role in a manner that achieves many of the sam= goals, but in a more 
sustainable way. Advocates of the current paradigm e=phasize the dangers of moving off the current posture, such as 
worrying allies about the U.S. desire to remain e=gaged in regional affairs. As we have seen, however, the risks of 
refusing=to reform a bankrupt posture are far greater. Washington's current paradig= is being undermined; the only 
question now is whether U.S. officials take the initiative to craft a pers=asive, credible, innovative concept to supplant it. 
At the moment, there=seems little interest in such a process. The existing paradigm is deeply i=grained in habits of 
thought and assumptions about the nature of world pol=tics and the necessary U.S. role in the international system. For 
ideological and political reasons, the manag=rs of U.S. national security remain resistant to necessary changes. Even t=e 
Obama administration, which promised a transformation of U.S. foreign po=icy, has reaffirmed and even deepened 
many aspects of the conventional paradigm. Successive U.S. administrations=will be likely to apply well-established 
concepts, doctrines, worldviews, =nd ideologies for example, the forward deployment of U.S. military forces =n support 
of regional alliances and the U.S. commitment to global precision strikes for counterterror purp=ses whose effect will be 
to emphasize or even exaggerate the immediate thr=ats facing the United States, and to militate against dramatic 
changes in =he existing paradigm. 
Most likely, we will=see a sort of halfway strategic reform: policies will make a seeming shift=to a supposedly 
constrained posture without actually surrendering the core=elements of the current paradigm. A perfect example of 
such an approach can be found in a recent essay by two =ormer senior Obama administration officials, who firmly reject 
"retrenchm=nt" while offering something they call "realignment" as an answer to th= obvious need for "a recalibration 
of the United States' global military posture."40 Their "realignment" i= fact defends nearly all the existing paradigm's 
assumptions. Such halfway=choices forfeit the opportunity for innovative strategic thinking at a cri=ical transition 
moment. They do not represent coherent, truly sustainable strategic postures, and they lea=e the time bomb at the core 
of the current paradigm the essential mismatch=between ends and means ticking loudly away. 
If a future U.S. adm=nistration were interested in a more dramatic break from the existing post=re, what steps might it 
take? This essay has been mostly a diagnosis; elem=nts of a cure are largely beyond its scope. Some principles do, 
however, suggest themselves. The first is a the=e on whichboth history and current analyses of the U.S. predicament 
speak =ost loudly: the essential causes of great power constraints and strengths =re always to be found at home, in the 
economic and social foundations of national power. Without an energ=tic campaign to reinvigorate institutions of 
national governance to addres= key national problems, catalyze growth and innovation in key sectors of t=e economy, 
build 21st-century energy and education sectors, and more, every other proposal for U.S. grand strat=gy will represent 
mere rhetoric. 
Second, the U.S. mil=tary establishment must shrink, and be deployed less with a stronger capac=ty to arrive with 
decisive force when required. This can be accomplished t=rough a combination of emerging capabilities (cyber, 
unmanned vehicle, stealth, long-range precision strike) as well as=hard core, over-the-horizon capabilities that can 
overawe the military of =ny single aggressor state. Such capabilities can sustain U.S. deterrent an= effectively "veto" 
large-scale aggression. The United States need not withdraw from all forward-deployed =ommitments, but it will need 
to assess its current slate much more frugall=. 
Third, U.S. strategi=ts need to design a new arrangement which preserves the essential function=of U.S. power in the 
current system shaping conditional preferences of oth=r states in different, more constrained, shared, and efficient 
ways.41 There is not space to sketch out what this m=ght mean in detail. One piece, however, could be to help the 
world communi=y comprehend events to help their capabilities in anticipation and respons= by expanding investments 
in knowledge, intelligence, and strategic foresight. A second component will be to becom= more adept at, and expand
