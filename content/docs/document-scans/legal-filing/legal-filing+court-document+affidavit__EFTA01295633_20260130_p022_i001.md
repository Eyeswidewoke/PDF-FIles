785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea;

the plant. The experts extrapolated comparative statistics for that period using an 
assumption that the racial composition of the bidding pool for those jobs was the same as 
for the post-2001 jobs analyzed (when Nucor retained actual bidding records). 
The workers also presented abundant direct and circumstantial anecdotal evidence of 
discrimination in promotions, including: 
Anecdotal evidence provided rsi by the seven named plaintiffs and nine other putative class members. claiming 
discrimination in specific promotions decisions in the Nucor production departments; 
' A description of complaints, contained in affidavits and depositions. made to plant General Manager Ladd Hall, who 
the workers allege failed to meaningfully respond; 
' Descriptions of retaliation against those who complained to management, 
' A written copy of Nucor's promotions policy and testimony that the policy was largely ignored in favor of giving 
unbridled discretion to supervisors; and 
• Testimony by a white supervisor that his department manager told him that "I don't think well ever have a black 
supervisor while I'm here." 
The facts undergirding the workers' separate hostile work environment claim, not directly 
at issue in this appeal, also bear on the promotions analysis. Those facts are disquieting in 
their volume, specificity, and consistency. Supervisors allegedly routinely referred to black 
workers as "nigger" and "DAN (dumb ass nigger)," with one supervisor reportedly stating 
"niggers aren't smart enough" to break production records, while others tolerated the 
routine use of epithets like "bologna lips," "yard [`6] ape," and "porch monkey." These 
epithets and others were broadcast over the plant-wide radio system - comprising a 
network of walkie-talkies used to communicate - along with monkey noises and the songs 
"Dixie" and "High Cotton." The workers' declarations and depositions further suggest that 
departmental supervisors and the plant's general manager consistently ignored racial 
harassment carried out by white workers, including the circulation of racist emails, the 
prominent display of a hangman's noose, the commonplace showing of the Confederate 
flag, and an episode when a white employee draped a white sheet over his head with eyes 
cut out in the form of a KKK hood. 
In 2007, the South Carolina district court denied the workers' motion for class certification 
for both the promotions and hostile work environment claims. In 2009, a divided panel of 
this Court reversed, concluding that the workers satisfied the threshold requirements of 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. We remanded the case 'with instructions to certify the 
appellants' class action." Brown I, 576 F.3d at 160. 
On February 17, 2011, the district court followed our instructions to certify the class, 
concluding that the workers satisfied Rule 23(b)(3)'s requirements that common questions 
predominate ["7] and that the class action was superior to other litigation devices ['9OO] 
to resolve the dispute. The district court later declined to stay the case pending a ruling in 
Wal-Mart, and it declined to reconsider its order certifying the class. 
The Supreme Court decided Wal-Mart in June 2011, decertifying an unprecedented 
nationwide class of approximately 1.5 million female employees spread over 3,400 stores. 
Wal-Mart held that the plaintiffs had failed to present a "common contention" of 
employment discrimination capable of "classwide resolution," as required by Rule 23(a)(2).
