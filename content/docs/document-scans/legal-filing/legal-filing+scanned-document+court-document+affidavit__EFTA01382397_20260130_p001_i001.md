Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS 
The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder (as defined 
herein) of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock as of the date hereof. This summary deals only with common 
stock that is held as a capital asset. 
Except as modified for estate tax purposes (as discussed below), a "non-U.S. holder' means a beneficial owner of our common 
stock that, for United States federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not any of the following: 
• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 
• a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia: 
• an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source: or 
• a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons 
have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United 
States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. 
This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code") and regulations, rulings 
and judicial decisions, all as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States 
federal income and estate tax consequences different from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of 
United States federal income and estate taxes and does not address the effects of any other United States federal tax laws (including gift 
tax or the Medicare tax on certain investment income) and does not deal with foreign, state, local or other tax considerations that may be 
relevant to non-U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United 
States federal income or estate tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States 
federal income tax laws (including if you are a United States expatriate, "controlled foreign corporation," "passive foreign investment 
company" or a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes). We cannot assure you that a 
change in law will not alter significantly the tax considerations that we describe in this summary. 
If an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a 
partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership 
considering an investment in our common stock, you should consult your tax advisors. 
If you are considering the purchase of our common stock, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the 
particular United States federal tax consequences to you of the ownership of the common stock, as well as the consequences 
to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. 
Dividends 
Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined herein) below, dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder of our 
common stock generally will be subject to United States federal withholding tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by 
an applicable income tax treaty.
