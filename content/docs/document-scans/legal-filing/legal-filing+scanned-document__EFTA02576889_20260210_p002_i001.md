That is even true if we would include the supernatural. Imagine that we =ere living in a dream (i.e. that our experience of 
matter does not =eflect anything outside our minds, which is in some sense what the =agic or esoteric world views 
eventually come down to), we would still =e information processing systems that perform computations, i.e. =anipulate 
information, and could be described and modeled as cognitive =rchitectures. 
> So let's take it way out there: the bedeviling factor here might be =ow much of the dynamics that make up mind reside 
outside of the brain =r even outside of the body. The favorite fictional device in the =ake-believe that is scientific 
understanding is that of the system =oundary. A very useful approximation, to be sure, but we've already =een the idea 
of rigorous differentiation and sub-system boundaries in =he brain evaporate as we learn more about how it works. 
I would like to invite you to entertain for a moment the idea of giving =p on the essentialism here. The system boundary 
is merely a conceptual =hoice, which then determines the functional properties of the resulting =ystem. System 
boundaries are part of the map, not the territory. For =nstance, Andy Clark suggests that we should add tools (such as 
cars and =otebooks) and even a slice of the environment to our concept of mind. I =hink that this idea of the 'extended 
mind', as he calls it, makes a =ot of sense, but it won't change a bit of what we do as AI =esearchers: yes, we want to 
build our system to be able to use tools, =nd to integrate their mental model of these tools into its =roprioception and 
self-model. The only difference is in what part of =he resulting functionality we call 'mind', it is mostly =erminological. 
The attempt to strictly align the conceptual system boundary with the =unctionality has lead Maturana and Varela to 
their idea of =autopoiesis', a brilliant, intriguing and utterly poisonous notion that =as killed both cybernetics (—> 
second order cybernetics) and systemic =ociology (—> Luhmann) by turning them from proper sciences into =umanities. 
> So while I believe that a functionalist rebuilding is possible, I =hink we underestimate just how entwined we are in our 
environment. The =ogical extreme is that you couldn't perfectly simulate a human mind =ithout including the rest of the 
universe. 
Why? For instance, imagine a brain that is connected a birth to a =omplex game in with a physics simulation, and learns 
to interact with =hat environment. Why would the resulting system not qualify as a mind? =ecause it fails to simulate a 
particular human mind? (The latter does =ot strike me as the interesting task here, just as understanding flight =oes not 
amount to the exact simulation of a hummingbird.) 
> The open question, I guess, is just where on the spectrum between =arge single-all-encompassing system and small, 
closed, minimal =omplexity does mind lie. 
> • I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. 
I am sympathetic to Turing's original idea, to conceptualize minds as =ystems capable (at least) of intelligent, meaningful 
discourse. In my =iew, this necessitates a certain kind of generality of concept =cquisition and control that includes the 
equivalent of autonomous =erception, motivated action, associative and syllogistic reasoning and =o on. While I am not 
convinced that embodiment is a necessary condition =or having a mind, I think that a mind must be able to make use of 
a =ody when given one (i.e. a general Al architecture must be able to =ddress embodiment). 
> Has anyone voiced the worry that building AGI might make us aware of =arger structures in the universe that have the 
right level of =onnectionism, dynamism, and complexity to also support emergent minds? =hat it might lead us to to god 
(in an areligious sense)? We already =ave conjecture around the internet itself, the Gaia hypothesis before =hat. 
That idea is obvious and inevitable. I like the idea of framing the =eligious perspective as the assumption that the 
universe, or a =eta-structure beyond human organizations is intentional, self-aware and =artial towards our personal 
existence and toil. (But why should it.) On =he other hand, we can conceive of micro-minds, sub-structures of human =r 
animal minds that themselves present the functional properties that =efine mind-ness. In each case, however, we will 
have to make these =roperties explicit when we ask the question: mind as an atomic, =ssential concept is pretty useless 
here, and we will have to ask =urselves, whether a large or small structure in the universe is capable =f intentional
