investment) and accept that they will have recourse only to the assets of the Compartment in which they invest 
as these will exist at any time.

acquisition of Investments and changes in the legal or regulatory environment or that operation costs may be 
greater than anticipated.

return on any of the Company's Investments or that there will be any return on invested capital. Potential
