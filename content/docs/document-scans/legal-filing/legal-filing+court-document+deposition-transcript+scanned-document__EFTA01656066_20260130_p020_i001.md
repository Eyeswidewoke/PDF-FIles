. AEI: America at 250: Religion and the American Revolution — Wednesday, September 18, 2024. Location: AEI 
Auditorium, 2:30 PM. The year 2026 marks the 250th anniversary of American independence, yet the 
nation's founding is controversial now in ways it has not been in decades. In the third symposium of AEI's 
"We Hold These Truths: America at 250" project, scholars of American history, law, and theology will 
consider how religion shaped the American Revolution. Many who fought for independence understood the 
cause as a fundamentally spiritual struggle, one with enormous implications for religion's future in American 
civil society.Exploring the ways in which the founding generation understood religious freedom and worked 
to balance protections for diverse religious communities with the rights of individual conscience illuminates 
the commitment to liberty at the heart of the American project.

Officer, you will come away from this nonpartisan event with a clear understanding of what's at stake and
