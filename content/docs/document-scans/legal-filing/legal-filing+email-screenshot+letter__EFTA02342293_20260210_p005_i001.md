important here to note that will is not consciousness in the contemplative spiritual traditions of the East. Here a scientist 
or spiritual seeker may make a projection based on the knowledge gained in manas and qualified in ahamkara towards a 
revelation of pure consciousness (Puruasa). Mathematicians, physicists, and yogis work tirelessly here using known 
equations and practices, and sometimes they develop new ones creating new pathways, as they try to 'prove' or 'realize' 
these projections or explorations. A teacher who has gone beyond this stage is valuable beyond measure in helping 
others to overcome one's well worn pathways of thought and action towards a rewiring of the individual. 
Another qualification that may be helpful to this conversation is the difference between Advaita Vedanta and Dvaita 
Vedanta. It is clear that there are those that understand this well in this conversation, and others that may not. Please 
forgive me if this is too elemetary. Advaita Vedanta believes that there is only one consciousness and that this 
consciousness, for lack of better language, 'underlies' the entire universe and is the same consciousness that dwells 
within all of us--a unity of consciousness. Dvaita Vedanta, on the other hand, believes in multiple souls and separates an 
individual consciousness from the ultimate consciousness which goes by many names. 
Classical Samkhya as discussed above is Dvaitist. As is Classical Yoga and the Bhakti movements. 
Advaita Vedanta also has a form of Samkhya similar to the Classical version discussed here. In this version Purusa and 
Prakriti are polarities within a whole rather than separate. 
I hope this has been helpful to the Western scientists within this conversation. Or, those that may not have the 
philosophical background our Eastern sages, philosopher's and scientists grew up with. My intent is to offer up a clearer 
understanding of what is meant by consciousness in the Contemplative Traditions. I welcome any correction or further 
depth by those with deeper knowledge on this subject. 
When I was a girl of four or five my father, who was an abstract mathematician, told me that 2+2 rarely equals 4. He told 
me that anyone who stated otherwise did not understand mathematics. 
In my studies of Vedanta I was given the Kena Upanisad which speaks to seekers of knowledge: 
'I do not think that I know it well. Nor do I think that I do not know it. 
He among us who knows it, knows it and he, too, does not know that he does not know it. 
To whomever it is not known, to him it is known. 
To whomever it is known, he does not know. 
It is not understood by those who understand it. 
It is understood by those who do not understand it. 
When it is known through every state of cognition, it is rightly known. 
for (by such knowledge) one attains life eternal. 
Through one's own self one gains power and through wisdom one gains immortality. 
If here one knows it, then there is truth, and if here one knows it not, there is great loss. 
Hence, seeing (the Real) in all beings, wise men become immortal on departing from this world.' 
Kena Upanisad 2:2-5 (Radhakrishnan 1953) 
And so the conversations unfolds as seekers of knowledge. Thank you for including me on this chain of inquiry. I am 
humbled and honored.
