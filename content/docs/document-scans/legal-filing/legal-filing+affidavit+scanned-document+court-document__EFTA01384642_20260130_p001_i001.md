relative mispricings among them. Other forms of capital-structure arbitrage include buying "long" 
a fixed-income security of an issuer and entering into a credit default swap i.e., basis trading), 
which calls for payment to an Underlying Fund of the principal amount of the fixed-income 
security against the security's delivery in the event that the issuer suffers a "credit event" 
(essentially, an event tantamount to default on its debt), as well as buying "long" an issuer's equity 
and selling "short" that issuer's debt, based on the determination that the equity is under-priced 
relative to the debt. 
Credit Strategies: This investment strategy involves long and short investments in different 
corporate and asset-backed securities and derivatives, including loan participations and allocations 
i.e. interests in a loan, generally governed by a credit agreement between the original lending 
syndicate) in the secondary market. Other credit-related strategies take various different forms, 
including (but not limited to) buying and selling different credit-sensitive instruments relating to 
one issuer, selling "short" bonds of an issuer subject to potential credit deterioration, and buying 
distressed and high-yield securities offering favorable return profiles. 
Distressed Strategies: These strategies involve purchases and sales of debt and equity securities 
and obligations of companies that the General Partner believes are (i) likely to be defaulting on 
their obligations; (ii) entering bankruptcy; (iii) in bankruptcy; (iv) liquidating; (v) emerging from 
bankruptcy; (vi) restructuring; or (vii) otherwise in distress or emerging therefrom. The strategy 
involves the purchase of obligations of declining or low credit quality borrowers at a discount, 
with the expectation or hope that the company will either improve its performance without the 
need to enter into bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, or that the company will seek the 
protection of bankruptcy and insolvency laws and that its previously outstanding debt obligations 
will be converted into obligations of or equity in a healthier, restructured company. Distressed 
strategies frequently require an activist approach to be taken, including communicating directly 
with the officers or advisors of the issuer, joining a creditors committee or shareholders committee, 
or joining or initiating legal action to protect the rights of the Partnership. Another form of 
distressed investing involves the purchase of participations on the secondary market in recently 
issued loans to, or Securities issued by, industrial and other operating companies in the United 
States and abroad. Such loans may be used to refinance an issuer's debt (thereby avoiding 
bankruptcy), to fund company operations while in bankruptcy or upon emergence from bankruptcy 
(thereby allowing them to reorganize successfully through bankruptcy), or to fund operations of a 
company with limited access to traditional financing sources. 
Directional Equity, Corporate Debt. Derivatives or Currencies: These strategies involve trading 
in equity, debt, derivatives or currencies using technical or fundamental analysis or a combination 
thereof in anticipation of profiting from movements in the prices of these assets. Such investments 
may be concentrated in specific industry sectors and may include short- or long-term investments, 
as well as investments in investment grade or distressed debt or equity. 
Relative Value Long/Short Equity: Under this strategy, an Underlying Fund may take a number 
of long and short positions in a particular equity market to create a portfolio that is designed to 
have a reduced, if any, net market exposure. Equities that are deemed relatively undervalued are 
purchased long and relatively overvalued equities are sold short. This strategy can benefit from 
relative value discrepancies with reduced stock market risk and may be driven by fundamental 
analysis of industry sectors.
