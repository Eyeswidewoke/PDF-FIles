Bankr. L. Rep. (CCH) P83,176; 64 Bankr. Ct. Dec. 216 
Cammeby's Funding LLC, 20 N.Y.3d 438, 445, 985 N.E.2d 893, 962 N.Y.S.2d 583 (2013), 
and the "parties' r797] interpretation of the contract in practice, prior to litigation," Ocean 
Transp., Inc. v. American Philippine Fiber Indus., Inc., 743 F.2d 85, 91 (2d Cir. 1984). 
Applying these tools, we conclude, as did the district court, that the parties understood that 
the Second-Lien Notes constituted Senior Indebtedness. See 531 B.R at 331 n.7. 
First, MPM repeatedly represented to the Securities Exchange Commission and to the 
financial community that the Second-Lien Notes were Senior Indebtedness. It did so in its 
prospectuses, 8-Ks and 10-Ks. For example, it disclosed in a November 2010 8-K that the 
Second-Lien Notes are "senior indebtedness of the Company . . . and will rank . . . senior 
in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness." 15-1771 JA 3057; 
see ["*18] also 15-1771 JA 2231. It went further when it subsequently resold certain 
Subordinated Notes. In a May 2013 prospectus, MPM restated that the Subordinated 
Notes "are subordinated to all our existing and future senior debt, including the . . . 
Second-Priority Springing-Lien Notes." MPM also specifically identified as the first risk 
related to the Subordinated Notes that those holders' "right to receive payments on the 
Notes is junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets." 15-1771 JA 
3007, 3010. MPM further asserted that in the event it were to file for bankruptcy and were 
unable to repay its secured debt, "it is possible that there would be no assets remaining 
from which your claims could be satisfied." 15-1771 JA 3010. The Subordinated Note 
holders knew all of this because the Debtors were contractually obligated, pursuant to 
Section 4.02 of the 2006 Indenture, to provide copies of its 10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks, and all 
other required disclosures both to the Subordinated Note holders as well as to their 
Trustee—a highly sophisticated group of investors. 15-1771 JA 357. There is no dispute 
that these disclosures occurred. Consequently, it was widely understood in the investment 
community that the Second-Lien Notes had priority. 
Second, the Subordinated r191 Notes holders' interpretation generates the irrational 
outcome that the springing of the Second-Lien Notes' security interest, which was meant to 
enhance the note holders' protection, would actually strip those notes of their status as 
Senior Indebtedness and therefore their priority over the Subordinated Notes. As the 
bankruptcy court concluded, "[tjhere is no logical reason for such a distinction, 
notwithstanding the subordinated noteholders' attempt to find one." 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 
3926, 2014 WL 4436335, at *9. 
Third, the Subordinated Notes holders' proposed interpretation that "in any respect" covers 
all junior liens would mean that no senior note classes would qualify as Senior 
Indebtedness because each was secured in some respect by a junior lien. For example, 
the First-Lien Notes were secured in part by a second priority lien on collateral securing a 
prepetition revolving credit facility. See 15-1771 JA 2425-26. We think it highly improbable 
that anyone understood this interpretation to be correct. Certainly MPM did not. For 
example, in a December 2012 prospectus MPM represented to the SEC that the Senior-
Lien Notes were Senior Indebtedness. 15-1771 JA 3725. Because those note classes are 
subordinate to pre-existing liens as to the Debtors' collateral, they, too, would seemingly 
not ["20] qualify as Senior Indebtedness under the Subordinated Notes holders' 
interpretation. In light of these factors, we have little trouble concluding that the extrinsic 
evidence establishes that the most reasonable interpretation of the Indenture is that the
