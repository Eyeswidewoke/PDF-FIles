S-I/A 
Accordingly, the Company may adopt the standard in either the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 or 2018. The 
guidance can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of 
adoption. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting 
standard update on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
In August 2014. the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern. The new 
guidance provides guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's 
ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be 
required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a 
going concern within one year from the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. This guidance will be effective for the 
Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe the pending 
adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
In April 2015. the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03. Interest—Imputation of Interest, accounting standards update under which 
the debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability will be required to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct 
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendment is effective for financial 
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15. 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early 
adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this new guidance and it did not have any effect on the consolidated financial 
statements. 
In April 2015 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software. The new 
guidance will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement by providing 
guidance as to whether an arrangement includes the sale or license of software. This guidance will be effective for the Company's 
fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe the pending adoption of ASU 
2015-05 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, as part of its simplification 
initiative. The current guidance requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement 
cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. Under the new guidance, inventory is 
measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which would eliminate the other two options that currently exist for market 
replacement cost and net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The amendment is effective for financial 
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15. 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early 
adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance may have on the consolidated financial 
statements. 
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. 
The new guidance simplifies the accounting for measurement period adjustments in connection with business combinations by 
requiring that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the 
reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for 
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The 
Company early adopted this new guidance and it did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, provides a consistent framework to define, measure, and disclose the fair value 
of assets and liabilities in financial statements. ASC 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy priority for disclosure of assets and 
liabilities recorded at fair value. The ordering of priority reflects the degree to which objective prices in external active markets are 
available to measure fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the 
valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. 
The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable 
inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in 
pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair 
value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are 
categorized in one of the following levels:
