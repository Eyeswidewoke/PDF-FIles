Worse still, the dissent in Brown I reached the question of whether the 27 forms 
represented promotions without the issue having been raised, much less analyzed, by the 
district court in its original order denying certification, see J.A. 8979, or by Nucor itself in its 
briefing before this Court in Brown l.° The dissent in Brown I thus both engaged in sua 
sponte fact-finding to divine which forms were used, and then got the facts wrong.° Using 
the flawed data, the dissent concluded in Brown I that "[ojn this record, it is difficult, if not 
impossible to discern whether the 2000 data based on the nebulous change-of-status 
forms proves those positions were promotion positions available for employee bidding and 
thus relevant to the formulation of statistical evidence for the appellants' claims." Brown I, 
576 F.3d at 168 (Agee, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The district court 
expressly embraced that conclusion [""21] in decertifying the promotions class after Wal-
Mart. J.A. 10942. 
8 Nucor instead argued that the change of status forms failed to capture whether black employees bid on the positions, and 
whether the positions were open for bidding in the first place. Given the lack of controversy surrounding whether the 27 forms 
described promotions, the forms themselves were not introduced into the record until 2012. after the district embraced the fact-
finding conducted by the dissent in Brown I and observed that 'the Court has never seen the 27 charge-of-status forms. . . ." 
J.A 10943. The workers then appended all the forms to their motion to "alter and amend" the decertification order -- a motion 
that was denied. J.A. 11005. 11083. Notably, it also appears that in 2006 the workers' expert provided Nucor with a list of the 27 
employees used in the benchmark analysis. See J.A 1409. 1438. 
9 Given that history, we would be remiss not to acknowledge the irony inherent in the dissent's insistence that we are now 
impermissibly making factual determinations without due deference to the district court. 
Upon examining the correct change-of-status forms, discerning whether they represent 
promotions is a relatively r221 straightforward enterprise. Nineteen of the 27 forms 
expressly state they are for a promotion, for a "successful bidder' on a "higher position," or 
for a new position that was "awarded" or "earned." Two of the forms describe changes in 
job classification accompanied by an increase in pay. One form notes that an inspector 
was a "successful bidder" on a mill adjuster job — a move referred to on another change 
form as a promotion. Two forms are for a "successful bidder' on a new position where no 
new pay grade is noted. The remaining three forms appear to involve changes in positions 
or training that involved a decrease in pay, but there is no indication, or argument by Nucor 
or the district court, that the exclusion of those forms would substantially undermine the 
probativeness of the expert analysis. 
The second assumption criticized by the district court was that the bidding pools for the 27 
positions filled between December 1999 and January 2001 had the same average racial 
composition as the pools for similar jobs analyzed from 2001 to December 2003, when the 
company retained actual bidding data. Because of discovery limitations imposed by the 
district court, the information available r*23] regarding the 2001-2003 promotions was 
restricted to positions similar to ones bid on by the named plaintiffs, where there was at 
least one black bidder. However, because Nucor failed to retain bidding records for 1999-
2000, the data from that period could not ['9O6] be limited to positions where there was a 
known black bidder. Instead, the alternative benchmark had to assume that there was at 
least one black worker applying for each promotion analyzed -- an assumption that the 
district court concluded helped render the statistical analysis unreliable. But as we already 
determined in Brown I. the assumption does not fatally undermine the probativeness of the
