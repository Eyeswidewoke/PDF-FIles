Gulfstream IV 
OPERATING MANUAL 
provides a means to isolate the left and right side pneumatic systems when 
closed (its normal position). Conversely, when open. it joins the left and 
right side pneumatic systems, allowing the use of APU bleed air for both 
ECS packs during two pack air conditioning operations. In addition, it 
provides crossbleed capability during single engine operations to enable 
engine starting and cranking using the opposite side's pneumatic system, 
as well as APU bleed air. The bleed air isolation valve receives power from 
the Essential 115V AC bus (eA) through the BLEED AIR ISO S/O V circuit 
breaker. 
During normal operations, the isolation valve is closed and the left and right 
side pneumatic systems are isolated from each other. Manual selection of 
the ISOLATION switch (cockpit overhead panel, BLEED AIR section) 
opens the isolation valve. A "bar in the switch illuminates to fill in the 
crossover manifold line engraved on the BLEED AIR panel, signifying that 
the left and right side pneumatic systems are no longer isolated. In addition 
to the switch legend, a blue ISOLATION VLV OPEN advisory message is 
displayed on CAS. With the isolation valve open, crossbleed air and APU 
bleed air are available to both pneumatic systems for use by both 
refrigeration packs and for engine starting as required. 
In addition to manual control, the bleed air isolation valve Is capable of 
automatic control by certain bleed air configurations. If the isolation valve is 
closed, selection of APU BLEED AIR to ON or selection of either the 
MASTER CRANK or MASTER START switches to ON will automatically 
open the isolation valve. When API! BLEED AIR is selected off or the 
MASTER CRANK or MASTER START switches are selected off, the 
isolation valve will automatically close. 
A manual override slot drive is provided on the valve itself so that the valve 
can be positioned with a screwdriver without the need for electrical power. 
The slot drive is connected to a common shaft, ensuring the 
synchronization of internal limit switches with valve position al all times 
regardless of whether the valve is actuated electrically or manually. 
On airplanes SN 1445 and subsequent and SN 1000-1444 with ASC 422. 
the existing bleed air system wiring is modified to provide an annunciation 
for an incorrect bleed air configuration. This annunciation serves to caution 
the flight crew to the possibility of engine overtemperature it the isolation 
valve is open while the APU and/or engine bleed air switches are set to 
certain positions while on the ground. On SPZ-8400 equipped airplanes, an 
amber BLEED CONFIG caution message is displayed on CAS. On SPZ-
8000 equipped airplanes, an amber BLEED CONFIG light illuminates 
above each navigation display. See Figure 5. After a five second delay. 
display of the annunciation is prompted when: 
• Both ENG BLEED AIR switches are selected ON (OFF legend 
extinguished) with the isolation valve OPEN, or: 
• Either or both ENG BLEED AIR switches are selected ON and APU 
BLEED AIR is selected ON (isolation valve opens automatically). or: 
• Any two of the three available bleed sources (L ENG, R ENG and/or
