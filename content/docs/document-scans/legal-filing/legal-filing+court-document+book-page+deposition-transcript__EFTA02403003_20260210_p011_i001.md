The radius R(coo, .6,E) is a limit of how far an event can be from the reference clock and still 
be given an unambiguous time coordinate, within an accuracy of wo, when that event involves 
photons in an energy range AE. Now, if we are using photons to synchronizing clocks we are free 
to use photons of any energy so long as E > hwo. So given only the accuracy of the synchronization 
we want, we find again (27). 
All three arguments lead to the conclusion that there is a limit to how far apart two clocks 
can be if we want to synchronize them to a given accuracy, w. This phenomena is a kind of in-
frared/ultraviolet mixing, in that the presence of non-commutivity or modified dispersion rela-
tions at the Planck scale are limiting the definition of inertial coordinates at a large scale. This 
accords with the point of view proposed in [26] that when 1,

fects cannot be neglected. These effects may thus be seen as a kind of smile of a Cheshire quantum 
gravity cat, left over when the actual classical curvature can be ignored. 
4.1 Related mathematical issues 
In ordinary special relativity there is no such limitation to how far apart two clocks may be and be 
synchronized, and hence no limit to how large the coordinate frame used by an inertial observer 
may be. Because of this, the Poincare transformations form a Lie group. Consider boosts between 
observers at rest and moving with a velocity v made at the two events and Ti and call them 
Bs (v) and BF, (v). If T is the translation that takes the event to 
to £ we have 
Be(v) = T • BF, (v) • T-1 
(31) 
In other words, using the fact that Poincare group is a Lie group that contains translations 
and boosts, one can extend the definition of an inertial frame to coordinatize all of Minkowski 
spacetime without ambiguity. This expresses the fact that Einstein's procedure for synchronizing 
moving clocks can be extended to clocks arbitrarily far away from a reference clock. 
However, as we have just seen here that the situation cannot be so simple in n-Minkowski 
spacetime. This raises the question of whether the n-Poincare algebra can be exponentiated to 
a group, and what the structure of that group is. This is a question that has been investigated 
mathematically and it has been shown that, while the n-Poincare algebra has subalgebras which 
are isomorphic to the ordinary Lorentz algebra, that do exponentiate to the Lorentz group, the 
whole of the tc-Poincare algebra does not exponentiate into an ordinary Lie groupt25, 24]. This 
question is outside the scope of this paper, but the results of this paper underlie its importance. 
4.2 A perspective on these results 
What we can do is comment on the meaning of these results in the context of the general problem 
of the construction of a quantum theory of spacetime. Recall Mach's principle, or more generally, 
the notion of relational spacetime, which asserts that the spacetime geometry reflects the rela-
tionships amongst physical particles whose history actually defines the spacetime. This idea is 
implicit in special relativity; indeed Einstein defined events in special relativity by the coincidence 
of worldlines representing the histories of physical particles. In special relativity however the 
lorentz transformation of an event does not depend on the properties of a particle traveling on 
the worldlines, as a result one has an unambiguous description of spacetime independent of what
