S-I/A 
We met Jerad and Justin, brothers and co-owners of Sightglass Coffee, who were forced to stitch together disparate 
systems and processes to handle their basic business operations. 
We met Andrei, a flight instructor, who depended on checks from his customers and never knew when the checks would 
clear and the money would be available in his bank account. 
We met Kiya, the owner of a clothing store called Self Edge, who was declined by his traditional payment processor 
when he tried to expand his business from California to a second location in New York. 
Cheri, Jerad and Justin, Andrei, and Kiya signed up for Square and became our first sellers. We learned a great deal 
from them: the value of accessibility, the power of integrated services, the importance of speed, and the necessity of trust. 
What they taught us helped make Square what it is today and inspired our mission to make commerce easy. 
These sellers are only four of the over 30 million businesses in the United States, with millions of entrepreneurs starting 
more each year. Each has its own story to tell. We measure our success by their success. We listen to them, learn from them. 
and help them grow into their ambitions.
Our Business 
We started Square in February 2009 to enable anyone with a mobile device to accept card payments, anywhere, 
anytime. While we found early success providing easy access to card payments, commerce extends beyond

payments. In every transaction, we see opportunity for our sellers: to learn more about which products are selling best, to 
reinvest in their businesses, or to create and engage loyal buyers. Although we currently generate approximately 95% of our 
revenue from payments and point-of-sale (POS) services, which includes the impact of revenue generated from Starbucks. we 
have extended our product and service offerings to include financial services and marketing services, all to help sellers start, 
run, and grow their businesses. 
We work to democratize commerce—leveling the playing field for sellers of all sizes. Our focus on technology and design 
allows us to create products and services that are accessible, intuitive, and easy-to-use. We set attractive and transparent 
pricing, and we accept approximately 95% of sellers who seek to process payments with Square. We provide a free software 
app with our affordable (often free) hardware to turn mobile devices into powerful POS solutions in minutes. Our insights into 
our sellers' businesses have allowed us to develop services that are applicable to businesses of all types and sizes, from 
Square Analytics to digital receipts. We also continue to add advanced software features that tailor our POS solution to specific 
types of sellers, such as open tickets for bars and restaurants and inventory management for retailers. 
Because of our approach, we have grown rapidly. Millions of sellers accept payments with Square. They span all types 
of businesses: from cabs to coffee shops, lawyers to landscapers, retail stores to restaurants. Although substantially all of our 
revenue is currently generated in the United States, we also serve sellers throughout Canada and Japan. As this international 
base of sellers grows, so too should our Gross Payment Volume (GPV) and revenue in these regions. We serve sellers of all 
sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers' market to multinational businesses. Our products and services are built to 
scale, so sellers can stay with us over the life of their businesses. In the 12 months ended September 30. 2015, sellers using 
Square processed $32.4 billion of GPV, which was generated by 638 million card payments from approximately 180 million 
payment cards. GPV measures the total dollar amount of card payment transactions we process for our sellers (net of refunds), 
excluding card payments processed for Starbucks and our Square Cash peer-to-peer service. Since we generate transaction 
revenue as a percentage of payment volume, we believe GPV is a key indicator of our ability to generate revenue. In the 12 
months ended September 30, 2015, over two million sellers accepted five or more payments using Square. accounting for 
approximately 97% of our GPV. 
The foundation of our business model is the millions of sellers processing payments with Square. We estimate that, to 
date, nearly half of our sellers have found us and signed up. rather than us having found them, adding efficiency to our sales
