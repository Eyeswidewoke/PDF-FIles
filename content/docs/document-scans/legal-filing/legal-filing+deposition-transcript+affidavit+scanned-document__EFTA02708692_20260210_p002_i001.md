June 13, 2014 -- In=a high-profile speech <http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/us/politics/obama-foreign-poli=y-
west-point-speech.html> to Army =adets last month, President Obama tried to move beyond America's tumultuous 
adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan w=th a new doctrine all but forswearing the use of military power except in =he most 
dire of circumstances. 
Barely two weeks la=er, Mr. Obama has already found himself in those circumstances and seems o= the verge of 
ordering the American military to intervene once more in Ira=. While ruling out ground troops to save the beleaguered 
Baghdad government from insurgents, Mr. Obama is cons=dering a range of options, including airstrikes by drones and 
piloted airc=aft. 
The possible return=to Iraq, even in limited form, underscores just how much that forlorn land=has shaped Mr. Obama's 
presidency. It defined his first campaign for the=White House, when his opposition to the war powered his candidacy. It 
defined his foreign policy as he resolved to=pull out of Iraq and keep out of places like Syria. And it defined the leg=cy he 
hoped to leave as he imagined history books remembering him for endi=g America's overseas wars. 
Yet as much as he w=nted Iraq in the rearview mirror, the swift march toward Baghdad by Islami=t extremists calling 
themselves the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or IS=S, has forced him to reconsider his approach. As much as he wanted 
to leave the fate of Iraq to the Iraqis the=selves, he concluded that the United States still has a stake in avoiding =he 
collapse of a state it occupied for more than eight years at the cost o= nearly 4,500 American lives. 
"We have an inter=st in making sure that a group like 1.5.1.1., which is a vicious organizat=on and has been able to take 
advantage of the chaos in Syria, that they do='t get a broader foothold," Mr. Obama said on Friday, using an alternative 
name for the group, the Islamic State=in Iraq and the Levant. "There are dangers of fierce sectarian fighting =f, for 
example, the terrorist organizations try to overrun sacred Shia sit=s, which could trigger Shia-Sunni conflicts that could 
be very hard to stamp out." 
Stepping back, he c=ted the United States' own tortured history in Iraq and the desire not t= let American efforts there 
go to waste. "We have enormous interests the=e," he added, "and obviously our troops and the American people and 
the American taxpayers made huge investments a=d sacrifices in order to give the Iraqis the opportunity to chart a 
better=course, a better destiny." 
Still, he insisted =hat Iraq's leaders have to make the sorts of compromises that will bring=stability to their country, and 
stressed that he would not let their probl=ms consume the United States all over again. "We're not going to allow 
ourselves to be dragged back into a s=tuation in which, while we're there, we're keeping a lid on things,"=but Iraq's own 
political leaders are failing to address the underlying f=ssures dividing the society. 
Mr. Obama has long =een criticized by Republicans for pulling troops out of Iraq at the end of=2011 without leaving 
behind a small residual force. That was a timetable o=iginally agreed to by President George W. Bush, and Iraqi leaders 
at the time would not agree to immunity provisi=ns insisted on by the Pentagon, but critics argued that Mr. Obama 
should h=ve tried harder to extend the American presence. 
Moreover, they said=the president has not done enough to pressure Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al=Maliki to reconcile 
with the Sunni minority, and they said Mr. Obama's f=ilure to do more to help moderate rebels in next-door Syria has 
emboldened more radical Islamist forces who have sp=lled over into Iraq. 
Not only has the la=est eruption in Iraq revived those criticisms, but it has also exposed the=president's plan for 
withdrawing from Afghanistan to further questions. =r. Obama announced last month that he would end the combat 
mission there by the end of this year, leaving behind=9,800 troops, all of whom would leave by 2016. 
Republicans on Frid=y urged Mr. Obama to act decisively in Iraq, questioning why he wants to t=ke several days to 
decide. "We shouldn't have boots on the ground, but=we need to be hitting these columns of terrorists marching on
