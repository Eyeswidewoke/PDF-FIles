3. Private sector losses look too low for purposes of a stress test, particularly if sovereign debt restructuring is assumed. 
One example: Spain had perhaps the biggest housing bubble in the world outside Ireland'. EBA loan loss assumptions for 
Spanish mortgages arc only 1.5% under the EBA "adverse scenario". Residential mortgages are full-recourse in Spain, are 
generally on first homes and not vacation homes, and mostly pegged very low floating rates; as a result, current NPLs are 
only 2.5%. But with Spanish housing transactions down 70% from 2007, shouldn't a stress test pencil in something worse? 
During Spain's 1993 recession, when GDP growth also fell to 1%, problem loans reached 6.5% and loan loss provisions 
were 4.5%. In general, we find that most EBA assumptions are much less dire than May 2009 US stress test levels. 
4. The losses assumed by the EBA were offset by an almost identical amount of pre-provision income, resulting in no 
capital shortfall for most banks. The income projections look high to us given economic conditions in Europe. 
5. There's a lot of confusion about which capital ratios make the most sense (Basel II. Basel Ill. Core Tier I, Equity to Assets. 
etc). The EBA used the most generous one (Basel II). These issues are complex, and are strenuously debated by 
investors. Our view: even after adjusting for differences in derivatives accounting (European banks hold more of their 
derivatives on balance-sheet), European banks report much lower risk-weighted assets as a % of total assets than US banks 
(see chart in Appendix). This may reflect the use of less conservative risk-weighting models in Europe; in the US, the Fed 
is quite strict on this issue. In our view, there has not been enough detailed cross-border analysis to support 
permanently lower equity-to-asset ratios of European banks, regardless of what Basel III capital formulas say. 
6. The EBA stress test included a clause ("Point 15") which stated a desire to reduce reliance on external rating agencies, and 
instructed the Commission to work on proposals to that effect. Rating-agency bashing is a worldwide sport these days, and 
they deserve it given their abjectly poor work on structured credit. But rating agencies have a better track record on 
corporate, sovereign and municipal exposure, and this kind of comment is worrisome to investors when used cynically 
by politicians to refute ratings downgrades and risk assessments. The same holds for criticism of S&P by the Secretary 
of the Treasury and members of Congress in the wake of the downgrade of the United States. 
This is why financial markets have lost confidence in this 
process. Once lost, confidence is difficult to restore, and 
Europe is paying a price for this. Last year, share prices 
were high enough that perhaps EU banks could have raised 
equity at higher levels. As things stand now, with EU 
banks trading at close to 0.4 times book value, equity raises 
imply much more dilution for shareholders, and official 
sector capital may be the only way out for some. 
The U.S. has plenty of problems regarding some of its 
own banks, but its 2009 stress test effectively convinced 
global markets to start dealing with US banks on a 
"business as usual" basis again. As shown in the chart, 
the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) used 
loss assumptions that rivaled the peak of the Great 
Depression. The purpose was to move beyond bank 
solvency as a systemic market risk issue, and focus on other things.

Until the issue of European bank capitalization is addressed, it will be difficult for global markets to regain their footing, 
despite what looks like oversold conditions in equity markets. We expect the EU to address this, perhaps by converting 
the EFSF into a government-owned bank which would buy government-issued bonds using debt financing from the 
government-run Central Bank (1 know, the government is sitting in all the seats; don't ask). Commissioner for 
Economic and Financial Affairs Olli Rehn acknowledged that the EFSF's firepower needs to be increased, and EFSF 
CEO Klaus Regling responded to questions on the topic by saying "wait a few more days". Our sources tell us 
something is in the works. However, the timing, magnitude and realism of the official sector response will determine 
how positive the market reaction will be. Seeing is believing.
