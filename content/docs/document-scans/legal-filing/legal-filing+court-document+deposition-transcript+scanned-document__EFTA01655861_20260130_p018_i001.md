political authority from national governments to planetary institutions, as well as to localities. Join the 
Carnegie Endowment for a fascinating discussion of Children of a Modest Star: Planetary Thinking for an Age 
of Crises. We'll consider the cosmological significance and practical dilemmas posed by our planetary age 
and the desirability, and feasibility, of building new institutions to help sustain life on Earth. Stewart Patrick, 
senior fellow and director of Carnegie's Global Order and Institutions program, will moderate a discussion 
with authors Jonathan Blake, associate director at the Berggruen Institute, and Nils Gilman, chief operating 
officer, vice president for programs, and editor of the magazine Noema at the Berggruen Institute, as well as 
Olivia Lazard, a fellow at Carnegie Europe. 
. CAP: State Leadership To Conserve Nature — Thursday, June 6, 2024. Location: CAP, 1:00 PM. In the face of 
accelerating climate and biodiversity crises, state and territorial lawmakers, agencies, and governors across 
the country are stepping up to conserve remaining natural areas and ensure that access to nature's benefits 
can be shared by all. Join the Center for American Progress and the National Caucus of Environmental 
Legislators (NCEL) for keynote remarks by White House Council on Economic Quality Chair Brenda Mallory 
and a conversation with state leaders from California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Maryland to reflect on 
recent land conservation policy successes, share lessons learned, and explore opportunities to scale up 
state-level progress. To learn more about state and territorial conservation efforts, read CAP and the NCEL's 
new report, which maps out the many policy tools utilized by states and territories for land conservation—
such as innovative conservation funding streams, outdoor equity funds, wildlife corridor designation, and 
Tribal land return—and highlights recent examples of state-level leadership from across the country. 
. AEI: Europe Goes to the Polls — Thursday, June 6, 2024. Location: AEI, 3:00 PM. Between June 6 and 9, the 
400 million eligible voters in the European Union's 27 member states will choose their new representatives 
in the European Parliament. These representatives will have to navigate turbulent economic and security 
environments and sharp disagreements over environmental and migration policy. The Parliament, one of the 
EU's two legislative bodies, has long been dominated by continent-wide groups of the center-left and center-
right. Recent polling has some wondering if far-right parties could disrupt this equilibrium, while the legacy 
political families are pondering how to respond to the changing electoral environment. Join AEI's Stan 
Veuger and a panel of experts for a conversation about the elections and their likely consequences for 
Europe and the transatlantic relationship. 
• Wilson Center: Mexico's Elections: Outcomes and Implications — Thursday, June 6, 2024. Location: Online 
Event, 11:00 AM. Ahead of the June presidential elections in Mexico, the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute 
organized a series of webinars covering critical issues concerning the electoral process to develop policy 
recommendations on the major challenges the incoming administration will face. Following the elections on 
June 2nd, we will provide analysis from top experts from civil society, academia, and the press from both 
sides of the border on what the results mean for the future of democracy in the country, and what to expect 
once the new president takes office. 
• Wilson Center: The High Seas Treaty: Latin American Leadership on Ocean Conservation — Thursday, June 6, 
2024. Location: Online Event, 11:00 AM. Prior to the High-Level Event on Ocean Action: Immersed in Change, 
from June 7 to 8 in San Jose, Costa Rica, the Wilson Center's Latin America Program, in partnership with the 
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense 
(AIDA), will host a dialogue on Latin America's leadership in supporting ratification and implementation of 
the High Seas Treaty as an important means to protecting the oceans and achieving the 30x30 global 
conservation agenda. Latin America and the Caribbean could be a leader in the treaty's ratification and a 
trailblazer in creating marine protected areas in the high seas. The region is already a standout in marine 
protection in territorial waters, with several countries having met or exceeded the 30% target, including 
Chile, Costa Rica, and Panama. By quickly ratifying the High Seas Treaty and designating conservation areas 
beyond national jurisdiction, the region would bring the treaty to life, showcase its potentially 
transformational impacts, and attract greater international support for environmental protection in the 
Americas.

June 6, 2024. Location: Wilson Center, 3:00 PM. New Drama (Houma µpama), an artistic movement that uses 
theater to speak about social problems, first gained traction in Russia's regional centers in the early 1990s
