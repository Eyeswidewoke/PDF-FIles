> An observer will always have to be implemented as a stable system =apable of state change, i.e. as a system of vortices 
that interact in =uch a way that they form a multistable oscillator that can travel in =nison. From the perspective of the 
observer, time is observed rate of =tate change in its environment, and it depends on its own rate of =hange, which in 
turn depends on the speed of the observer. This gives =ise to relativistic time. Also, the observer does not perceive itself 
=s being distorted, but it will normalize itself, and instead perceive =ts environment around itself as being distorted. As a 
result, the =bserver will always have the impression to travel exactly in the middle =f its light cone. This model seems to 
recover Lorentz invariance, but =ith a slight catch: it seems to me that while speed of light is =onstant and there is no 
preferred frame of reference wrt acceleration, =he resolution of the universe changes with the speed of the observer. 
=o idea if this is a bug or a feature, or if it will be neutralized by =omething I cannot see yet before I have a proper 
simulation. 
> Obviously, all of the above is just a conjecture. I can make a =onvincing looking animation, and I am confident that 
many features like =imultaneity etc. will work out, but I don't yet know if a proper =umeric simulation will indeed work 
as neatly as I imagine.
