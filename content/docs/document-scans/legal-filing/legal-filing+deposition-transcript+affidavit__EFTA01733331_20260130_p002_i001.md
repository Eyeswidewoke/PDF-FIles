After the meeting with the Australian-British delegatio=, the PA Minister of Education Dr. Sabri Saidam =aid that he "was 
surprised by the group's 'explosive, blunt and rude' ques=ions about Palestine's education system." "There was a lot of 
incitement l=would say on behalf of the delegation meaning or implying that the Palesti=ians are the ones terrorizing 
Israel," Saidam said. He complained that Aus=ralian Federal Industry Minister Christopher Pyne had not discussed 
educat=on with him but instead about "political difficulties." Minister Saidam st=ted that Minister Pyne "had a list of 
questions and they were misinformed.= [SB5 News, Dec. 16, 20151

Headline: "Gra=evine: Between Jerusalem and Berlin" 
By Greer Fay Cashman 
"PRIOR TO the dinner on Sunday, following a presentation by It=mar Marcus from Palestinian Media Watch, Dialogue 
participants went to Ram=llah to meet with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah and =he PA education 
minister, who were asked about the naming of a girls high =chool after a terrorist, Dalal Mughrabi; sporting events 
named after terro=ists; branding anyone who supported peace initiatives through sport as tra=tors; and the preaching of 
hatred through the education system. According =o the Australian Labor Party's Glenn Sterle, who is the senator for 
Wester= Australia in the Parliament of Australia, Australian and UK delegates wer= at all times respectful and courteous 
to the prime minister when putting =heir questions. 
The prime minister gave a brief o=erview of the situation between Israel and the PA. He shared the concerns =he PA has 
with Hamas and the reconstruction effort of the PA in Gaza. He t=ld the group that the Palestinians are willing to 
commence peace talks tow=rd a two-state solution with Israel, but not until there is a freeze on th= expansion of 
settlements. 
The term "occupation" was us=d numerous times, said Sterle. 
When questions from the =elegation were put to the prime minister, the responses were varied, Sterl= added. 
"Firstly, there was complete denial that any sc=ools in the West Bank were named after terrorists. He challenged us to 
che=k our information. He reiterated a number of times that our information wa= incorrect. 
But when he was returned to the question by=other members of the delegation, he then went into defending the 
practice =f 'honoring' terrorist-suicide bombers." 
Sterle noted t=at Hamdallah was at pains to share with the group the actions of Israeli s=ldiers who have killed 
numerous Palestinian youths who have done nothing m=re than throwing stones at the soldiers. He used the expression 
"they are =ot here having a picnic" several times when talking about the soldiers' pr=sence. 
His reasoning, said Sterle, was that Israel hono=s its "terrorists" by naming streets, buildings and airports after them. 
N=mes such as Ben-Gurion, Sharon and Meir - people who, he said, killed Pale=tinians - were cited. He also mentioned 
Baruch Goldstein, who killed 29 Mu=lim worshipers at prayer in Hebron.
