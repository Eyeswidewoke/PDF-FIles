Thesis 
Recent years have brought a wave of economic challenges to the Virgin Islands. A lingering global financial crisis, a 
virtual freeze in overall lending in the region, the closure of Hovensa, the rising energy costs and aging energy 
infrastructure have contributed to the malaise. These setbacks have resulted in chronically high unemployment, 
lower government revenues and have contributed to the fiscal challenges facing the Virgin Islands. These factors 
in turn have led to higher island wide taxes further straining small businesses and consumers and stifling economic 
growth. Additionally, the GERS pension s).stem is showing stress, threatening a generation of pensioners. High 
labor and energy costs and a difficult regulatory regime continue to deter new business formation and relocation 
and neighboring islands with lower operating costs are aggressively pursuing market share of the Territory's vital 
tourist business and attempting to lure away recipients of economic development benefits. In light of these 
troubling trends, the Governor has been focusing on identifying and leveraging its existing assets and strengths to 
spur new economic activity. The Territory has existing private and public sector infrastructure which sits 
underutilized — in particular a unique waterfront experience in Charlotte Amalie and extensive facilities and reach 
in the cruise ship industry. 
In fact, the tourist trade and the cruise ship industry• in particular represent perhaps 
the highest probability for economic growth and return to prosperity in the Virgin Islands. In working hand-in-
hand with the Governor and the people of the USVI, IGY believes that it an help finance the creation of a new 
approach to the merchandising and operation of the St. Thomas waterfront. IGY believes that the plan set forth 
below will permit the Governor to realize on his vision of a planned, fully integrated, waterfront experience for 
cruise passengers and yachtsmen alike. 
St. Thomas still maintains a leading position in the cruise ship industry in the Caribbean. It serves as a premier hub for 
major cruise ship lines operating in the Caribbean. St. Thomas offers extensive duty free shopping. In particular, US. 
citizens, including children, can return to the mainland USA with up to $1,600.00 worth of duty-free merchandise every• 
30 days from the U.S. Virgin Islands. The duty free allowance is $800 from elsewhere in the Caribbean. Over 1.79 
million cruise ship passengers disembarked in St. Thomas/St. ohn in 2012 (USVI bureau of Economic Research), many 
in the Charlotte Amalie Harbor immediately adjacent to Yacht Haven Grande. However, in recent years coordinated 
infrastructure and operational upgrades and strategic destination marketing, have placed St. Maarten on top of the 
Caribbean in average cruise passenger spending. Cruisers are spending on average US 5185.40 in St. Maarten 
compared to the regional average US $97. St. Marten is second in crew spending slightly behind the USVI 
averaging US $138.30 per crew member compared to US 5135.50 in St. Maarten (figures from the Business 
Research and Economic Advisors (BREA)). St. Maarten is one the few countries that showed both an increase in 
cruise passenger spending and passenger arrival, according to the study. The BREA report revealed that as it 
aggressively pursues market share, St. Kitts and Nevis cruise passenger arrivals have increased by 50 per cent in the 
past year. These competitive threats to the Territory's existing market share are increasing as St. Maarten has 
committed to meet customer demand for larger berths and as the USVI's ability to satisfy customer demand for
