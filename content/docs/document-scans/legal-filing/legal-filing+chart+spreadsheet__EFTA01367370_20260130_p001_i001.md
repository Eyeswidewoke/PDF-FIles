Near-term production is expected to be supported by the ramp of YE 14 start-
ups (Tubular Bells. Jack/St Malo) and the 2015/2016 (6 and 4 projects 
respectively) start-up of several key deepwater projects. While the projects are 
expected to add an incremental 350 mbpd of crude (2016 vs. 2014), the 
longer-term outlook (2018+) has less visibility beyond the contribution from a 
few (Appomattox) deep-water projects that are largely anticipated to be 
sanctioned this year. 
Primary Risks 
The near-term risk to production is largely synonymous with a risk to project 
start-ups which we regard as generally modest relative to projects with 
exposure to broader geopolitical turmoil and/or a dependence on cooperation 
with state owned national oil companies. However, the longer-term 
sustainability of production from the GoM will be largely dictated by the pace 
of improvements in the underlying economics for deepwater projects driven by 
a recovery in crude prices and from significant cost concessions. 
In our view, tracking the progress towards improvement long-term industry 
sentiment toward GoM Deepwater involves 
• 
A pick-up in FID activity. 
Aside from Appomattox, few unsanctioned 
projects are considered 'locks' to proceed through to FID this year. The 
sanctioning (and timing of) of Shenandoah and Mad Dog Phase II will 
speak to progress on the lowering of the cost curve and a higher level of 
conviction in the sustainability of higher crude prices. 
• 
Extension of Rig Contracts: Wood Mackenzie estimates that -28 DW GoM 
rig contracts are set to expire over the next 3 years. About 1/3 of the rigs 
to expire in 2015 have already been released/cold-stacked while the nearly 
20 rigs set to expire in 2016/2017 have as of yet not been released. 
• 
A uptick in M&A activity: Since 2012. GoM-focused deals have declined to 
8% of US deal flow in 2014 from 13% in 2012. With the short-cycle nature 
of the US onshore offering accelerated cost corrections and a widening 
valuation gap between 'haves' & 'have nots' at what point do discounted 
offshore valuations incentivize a pick-up in M&A activity?
