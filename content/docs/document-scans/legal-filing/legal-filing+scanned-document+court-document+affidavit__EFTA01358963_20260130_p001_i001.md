874 F.3d 787, "; 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 20596, **; 
Bankr. L. Rep. (CCH) P83,176; 64 Bankr. Ct. Dec. 216 
obligation that is meaningfully subordinate in some respect to a first-lien holder. These 
sophisticated parties knew how to cabin the type of subordination to which they refer; the 
indenture uses the term "subordinate . . . in right of payment" many times, including in the 
Baseline Definition itself. 
6 Debtors' attempt to downplay the significance of the term in any respect" in this context is unconvincing given that the term 
appears nowhere else in the indenture other than in the Fourth Proviso. 
Moreover, the Debtors' interpretation renders language in the indenture superfluous, which 
is a common sign of ambiguity. See RJE Corp. v. Northville Indus. Corp., 329 F.3d 310, 
314 (2d Cir. 2003) ( [HN3] in assessing ambiguity, courts consider the entire contract "to 
safeguard against adopting an interpretation that would render any individual provision 
superfluous" (internal quotation marks omitted)); see a/so Lawyers' Fund for Client 
Protection of State of N.Y. v. Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York, 94 N.Y.2d 398, 404, 727 
N.E.2d 563, 706 N.Y.S.2d 66 (N.Y. 2000) (concluding that an interpretation that renders a 
portion of a contract superfluous is "unsupportable: under standard principles of contract 
interpretation). Specifically, if the Fourth Proviso only excepts debt subordinate in right of 
payment, there is no purpose for the "in right of payment" carve-out in the Baseline 
Definition. We disagree with the lower courts' attempts to interpret away this superfluity 
[**16] by finding a distinction between "expressly" (in the Baseline Definition) and "by its 
terms" (in the Fourth Proviso). We see no meaningful distinction between those terms. 
Nevertheless, we also conclude that the Subordinated Notes holders' interpretation, that 
the Fourth Proviso unambiguously excludes the Second-Line Notes from the definition of 
Senior Indebtedness, is incorrect. As the lower courts correctly concluded, the 
Subordinated Notes holders' interpretation renders key parts of the Baseline Definition 
superfluous. Under their reading, that definition excludes from Senior Indebtedness only 
obligations subordinate "in right of payment," but the Fourth Proviso excludes all 
obligations that stand behind any type of other obligation. If so, the Baseline Definition's 
more limited carve-out for debt subordinate "in right of payment" would be unnecessary, 
because all such debt would be carved out from the definition of Senior Indebtedness by 
the Fourth Proviso. 
As the Subordinated Notes holders correctly acknowledge, "[for this indenture, it simply is 
not possible to avoid superfluity." 15-1771 Br. of Appellant 54 (internal quotation marks 
omitted). [HN4) Where, as here, varying interpretations rin render contractual 
language superfluous, we are not obligated to arbitrarily select one as opposed to another. 
Because the 2006 Indenture is open to differing reasonable interpretations as to whether 
the Second-Lien Notes constitute Senior Indebtedness, we conclude that it is ambiguous 
as a matter of law.

[HN5) Where a contract term is ambiguous, we look to extrinsic evidence to determine the 
intention of the parties. That evidence can include the parties' apparent intention, Walk-In 
Medical Centers, Inc. v. Breuer Capital Corp., 818 F.2d 260, 264 (2d Cir. 1987), what 
would be commercially reasonable, Fundamental Long Term Care Holdings, LLC v.
