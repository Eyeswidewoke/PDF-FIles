How One Man Secretly Stole $24M From McDonald's Monopoly Game 
KHOU (CBS-11) (10/01, Garz) reported that McDonald's recent revival of its popular Monopoly promotion has 
renewed attention on the "McMillions" scandal, one of the largest corporate fraud schemes of the early 2000s. At 
the center was Jerome "Jerry" Jacobson, a security officer for the company that produced the game pieces, who, 
from 1989 to 2001, secretly stole high-value tickets and distributed them to friends and family. According to the 
article, the network redeemed prizes ranging from $10,000 to $200,000, ultimately defrauding McDonald's of an 
estimated $24 million. The scheme unraveled in 2000 after the FBI received an anonymous tip about "Uncle Jerry" 
and discovered many winners lived near Jacobson's South Carolina home. Investigators even staged a fake 
commercial to gather evidence, eventually leading to Jacobson's arrest in 2001. The article noted that his trial 
opened on September 10, 2001, just one day before the 9/11 attacks overshadowed the case. The McMillions 
scandal is remembered for both the scale of the theft and the remarkable fact that it continued undetected for 
more than a decade. Additional reporting provided by Geekspin (10/01, Sadao).

growing form of fraud targeting older adults. The woman developed an online friendship with a man claiming to be 
an oil rig worker, who said he was isolated and in need of someone to talk to. After building trust, he suggested 
visiting her in Oklahoma but asked to borrow $1,000 to make the trip, followed by repeated requests for additional 
money. Ultimately, he vanished, leaving the woman defrauded and heartbroken. McGill said such scams—non-
romantic but emotionally manipulative—are among the most common fraud schemes reported against seniors in 
recent years, according to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.
