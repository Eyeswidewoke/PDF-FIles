investigations. Among =he points stated are that the Office accepts =nonymous complaints as well as direct complaints. 
University employees are required to =ooperate with any investigation or allegations of violations of this =olicy. 
Providing false or misleading information or failing to cooperate may result in disciplinary action. Individuals making a 
complaint or =participating as a witness in an investigation cannot be retaliated against. Any employee who engages in 
retaliation will be =isciplined. The Office of Equity and Inclusion does not make any findings until such time as it 
determines that it has completed its fact =athering. 
Our courts recognize that participants in an administrative investigation have a =rivilege against a defamation 
charge. In Paros v. Hoemako Hospital, 14= Ariz. 335, 681 P.2d 918 (Ct. App. Div. 2 1984), the court recognized that the 
employer's response to a notice of charge of =iscrimination filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
was absolutely privileged. In Miller v. Servicemaster by Rees, 17= Ariz. at 520, 851 P.2d 240, 243 (Ct. App. Div. 1 1993), 
the court recognized the existence of a conditional privilege for employees to report perceived acts of sexual 
harassment as public policy dictated that employees must be protected from workplace sexual harassment. Cited 
approvingly, Carey v. Maricopa County, 20=9 WL 750225 (D. Ariz. 2009). Both Paros an= Miller we=e cases concerning 
discrimination and harassment under Title VII. =n addition to its obligations under Title VII, the University must also 
operate its educational programs and activities to be free from gender =discrimination under Title IX. 
The Office of Equity and Inclusion will proceed with its investigation as =outlined in ACD 401 and P20. The Office 
will =ot provide your client with its investigative file. We look forward to Dr. =rauss's continuing cooperation. Regards, 
Dear Naimah et al: 
Attached you will find a letter from my attorney, along with a letter he sent to Buzzfeed earlier in this week 
regarding the defamatory and false story =they were planning on printing. The story was then published =esterday 
morning. I wanted to add to his letter, to reiterate our concern about how your office was planning to follow up on the 
false and defamatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because this was initiated by an =nline entertainment 
news outlet with a clear agenda and established record of =propagating false allegations about me, rather than by any of 
the individuals they refer to as sources, this should not be considered = credible allegation worthy of investigation. I 
believe that our initial =discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. Whether or =ot you agree with this, there are 
=wo things I think are important to =stablish. 
Firstly, that the University should not propagate what can be false allegations from =such a source by presenting 
them directly to current and/or former employees or to others. To do so would be to further their =ibelous agenda, as 
Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard, I would appreciate seeing copies of the correspondence you might send to 
current or former employees about this in the process of carrying out and concluding your investigation. 
Secondly, I reiterate once again that the Origins Project environment is supportive, candid, frank, honest, and 
productive, with all employees being treated with respect, as well as being supported and mentored. I =am proud of our 
team, and I believe they feel the same =ay. 
Thanks for your attention to these letters.
