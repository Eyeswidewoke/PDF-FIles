Iclusig Comes Back With a New Label and REMS; Upgrade to 
Outperform and Increase Price Target to $12 
On Friday, December 20, Ariad announced that it has reached agreement with the 
FDA for immediate reauthorization of Iclusig marketing in the United States, with a 
narrower label and accompanying Risk Mitigation Strategy (REMS) and post-
marketing requirements (PMRs). Ariad plans to resume shipping of Iclusig by mid-
January 2014. The new label stipulates that Iclusig is indicated in adult patients with 
T3151-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or T3151-positive Philadelphia 
chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), or in adult patients with 
CML and Ph+ ALL where no other tyrosine kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy is indicated. We 
note that on October 31, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suspended marketing 
of Iclusig based on the risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood 
vessels associated with Iclusig treatment We had been expecting the re-
commercialization of Iclusig with a narrower label, and we consider the REMS 
accompanied by four PMRs without an Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU) to be a 
favorable. We discuss the new label, REMS, and PMRs in detail herein. 
We are upgrading Ariad shares to Outperform and increasing our price target from 
$3 to $12 (exhibit 1, on page 5), based on the following: 1) limited downside with 
REMS and PMRs in place, in our opinion; 2) positive physician feedback during ASH 
and high number of single-agent INDs filed during marketing suspension; 3) 
potential for safer administration of Iclusig with lower doses in the future; 4) 
potential attempt at the frontline setting at lower doses as long-term upside; 5) 
other potential indications of Iclusig that are not included in our model: GIST, and 
NSCLC with FGFR and RET mutations; and 6) valuation: although the addressable 
patient population in 2014 is cut in half because of the narrower label (from 2,500 
to 1,300), the incidence is still substantial and the Iclusig patient population will 
build over time. We have increased our peak worldwide Iclusig revenue forecast to $747 
million in 2026 from our previous estimate of $275 million. Our revised probability-
adjusted NPV now assumes $10 per share for Iclusig and $2 for AP26113, compared with 
our previous estimate of $1 and $2 per share, respectively. 
• 
Iclusig is now accompanied by a REMS and PMRs without a dedicated 
restricted distribution plan, thus enabling relatively easy growth with 
limited downside risk, in our opinion. We had expected an ETASU in the REMS 
that could impose greater restrictions in the distribution of Iclusig. We believe 
with the new label, REMS, PMRs, and no ETASU, associated risks can be identified 
and managed without severely impeding Iclusig uptake and sales growth. From a 
regulatory perspective, we believe that Iclusig has been de-risked in the near 
term until perhaps 2016-2018 when we expect the readout of the required 
randomized control study (part of the PMRs) assessing the long-term safety of 
Iclusig treatment
