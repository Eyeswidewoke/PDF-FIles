nervous =ystem (for physiological, tactile, proprioceptive input), or, in the =ase of visual perception, the compression we 
see between retina and =ptic nerve. The optic nerve transmits massively compressed data from =he retina to the 
thalamus, and from there to the striate cortex (the =rimary visual cortex, V1). V1 is the lowest level of a hierarchy of 
=isual and eventually semantic processing regions: from here, the dorsal =nd ventral processing streams head off into 
the rest of the cortex. V1 =ontains filtering mechanisms, which basically look for blobs, edges, =ovements, directions and 
soon, based on local contrasts. V2 organizes =hese basic features into a map of the visual field, including contours, =3 
detects large, coherently moving patterns, V4 encodes simple =eometric shapes, VS seems to take care of moving 
objects, and V6 =elf-motion. The detection of high-level features always projects back =nto the lower levels, to 
anticipate and predict the lower level =eatures that should be isolated based on the higher-level perceptual =ypothesis. 
The story is similar for auditory processing, and eventually =he integration of basic visual and optical percepts into 
semantic =ontent: at each level, we take extremely rich and heterogeneous =atterns and reduce their complexity.

What about "abstract 2 =omplex" and "complex 2 complex"? Most of the existing approaches on =complex 2 complex" 
cognition are not really cognitive, such as Ansgar =redenfeld's "Dual Dynamics" architecture, or Herbert Jaeger's Echo 
=tate Networks. The current proponents of such complex cognition are =lso often radical embodimentalists (cognition as 
an extension of sensor =otor control, neglecting dreams, creativity, imagination, and =apabilities for abstract thinking).
