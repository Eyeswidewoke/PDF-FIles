It was odd, this tale of Hosni Mubarak. He had started out as = modest officer who had risen to power through the 
patronage and will of h=s predecessor, Anwar Sadat. Mubarak had not been imaginative or brave—and that was what 
recommended him to the f=amboyant Sadat. Where Sadat had been unabashedly open in his identificatio= with 
American power, the new man would be more discreet. Where Sadat had =een a trailblazer who had made that 
celebrated journey to Jerusalem, Mubarak would keep the peace with the Isr=elis, but keep them at arm's length. 
Throughout his reign, a toxic brew poisoned the life of Egypt=97a mix of anti-modernism, anti-Americanism and anti-
Zionism. That trinity=ran rampant in the universities and the professional syndicates and the official media. As pillage 
had become the =bsession of the ruling family and its retainers, the underclass was left t= the rule of darkness and to a 
culture of conspiracy. The middle class was=tentative and timid, unsure of itself. It knew the defects of the regime but 
could not contest its power.= 
More important, wit= the Muslim Brotherhood quietly toiling in the shadows, broad segments of =he middle class 
succumbed to the theocratic temptation. Wealth accumulated=in the Arab states and the Gulf had remade the 
Brotherhood. Its members were sly: They accepted the subtle acc=mmodation offered them by the regime. 
The historical role=of the centralized state in Egypt as the principal agent of social change =as abandoned. No wonder 
the Brotherhood sat out the early and decisive pha=e of the 2011 protests in Tahrir Square. Courage was not the 
hallmark of the Brotherhood. Its theorists were still =aintaining that the ruler was due deference and obedience while a 
new gene=ation of activists was battling the security forces. 
Yet the Brotherhood=had no scruples about "hijacking" a revolution that was not thei=s. The annals of revolutions the 
world over bear testimony to the truth th=t the rule of the moderates in times of revolutions is always undone by the 
ascendancy of the extremists. (Think of the libera=s who rode with Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979—so many of them were 
cut down=by firing squads.) 
It was no surprise that the Egyptian liberals and secularists q=arreled among themselves and were feckless and divided. 
The dictatorship h=d not allowed them political space and experience. In hindsight, the tipping point in the ruin of Egypt 
came in 2=05. The dictator rigged yet another presidential election, his fifth in a =ow, and he ordered a decent young 
rival, Ayman Nour, to prison on trumped =p charges. The administration of George W. Bush grasped the importance of 
the moment, but Mubarak brushed t=eir entreaties aside. 
President Obama and his advisers had two years on their watch b=fore the upheaval. But they lacked the interest and 
the determination—an= the knowledge of matters Egyptian. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described Mubarak as a 
friend of her family, and =ice President Joe Biden opined that the regime was stable even as millions=of Egyptians had 
gone out to push it into its grave. 
Today, a stalemate =aralyzes Egypt: The Brotherhood won a plurality in parliamentary elections=that began in 2011, but 
an activist judiciary declared the elections uncon=titutional and ordered parliament dissolved in June 2012. The 
Brotherhood drafted and secured the passage of a new con=titution by referendum in December, but those 
unreconciled to the reign of=the Brotherhood wanted nothing to do with it. 
Mohammed Morsi has the presidency, but he was defied some days=ago when he ordered a curfew in the cities of 
Ismailia, Suez and Port Said= Thousands went into the streets to sing and dance and play soccer in the night. From afar, 
those with a superficia= knowledge of Egypt think of it as a country willing to slip under the yok= of the Brotherhood. 
But Egypt is a skeptical, weary country; it wears its=faith lightly, and its people have an innate suspicion of those who 
overdo their religious zeal. 
The economy is wrecked and the government has run down its for=ign reserves as it attempts to maintain a system of 
costly subsidies. A $4=8 billion International Monetary Fund loan was tentatively agreed on, but the government was 
unwilling to put th=ough the austerity measures required by the loan. Only the remittances of =gyptians abroad, an
