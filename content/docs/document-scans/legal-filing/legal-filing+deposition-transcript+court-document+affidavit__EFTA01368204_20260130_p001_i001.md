The noted defense lawyer Alan M. Dershowitz and two lawyers who had sued him claiming defamation have dropped court actions 
against each side, ending a prominent dispute that included accusations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Oershowitz. 
The settlement, announced on Friday, included a financial arrangement. But a lawyer involved in the case would not say who had 
paid. 
"The contractual terms of the settlement prevent me from saying anything: said the lawyer, Jack Scarola, who represents the two 
lawyers who had sued Mr. Dershowitz in a circuit court in Florida about a year ago claiming defamation, Bradley J. Edwards and Paul 
G. Cassell. 
Mr. Dershowitz, who has represented such celebrities as O.J. Simpson and Leona Helmsley. said he was traveling. However, a 
spokesman for him, Richard Simpson, declined to discuss the agreements financial arrangements saying they were confidential. 
The dispute traces back to Mr. Dershowitz's representation of Jeffrey E. Epstein, a money manger who was accused a decade ago of 
paying underage girls for sexual services. Mr. Epstein subsequently pleaded guilty to two charges and was sentenced to 18 months 
in Jail, though he was allowed to spend many days working on the outside.
In 2014, one of Mr. Epsteln's accusers, 
claimed in court papers filed in a lawsuit seeking to have his plea 
agreement thrown out, that Mr. Dershowitz had sex with rrer vmne she was a teenager. Mr. Dershowitz adamantly denied the 
assertions and described her lawyers, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cassell, as "villains" who had fabricated the charges. 
The 
quently sued Mr. Dershowitz claiming defamation. and he responded with a counterclaim. Meanwhile, a judge 
struck 
comments from a court filing. 
Under the settlement. Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cassell acknowledged making what they described as a 'tactical mistake" in filing the 
sexual misconduct accusations against Mr. Dershowitz as part of a lawsuit in which he was not a party. 
However, they issued a statement saying their client
stands behind her claims. 
Mr. Dershowitz has said he has travel records and other documents to prove that he was not in same place as 
when she 
claims they had encounters. 
On Friday, he released a statement by Louis J. Freeh, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whom Mr. Dershowtz 
hired to investigate the matter. 
"Our investigation found no evidence to support the accusations of sexual misconduct." Mr. Freeh's statement said.
