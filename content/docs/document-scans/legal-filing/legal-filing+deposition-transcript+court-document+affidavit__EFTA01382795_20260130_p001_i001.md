variable rate senior secured term loan. Refer to Note 5 "Derivative Financial Instruments- of these consolidated financial statements for a 
discussion of the Company's derivatives. 
The original terms of FDC's senior secured tcnn loan facility required the Company to pay equal quarterly installments in aggregate 
annual amounts equal to I% of the original principal amount. However, in conjunction with debt modifications and amendments over the last 
several years, proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to prepay portions of the principal balances of FDC's senior secured term loans 
which satisfied the future quarterly principal payments. Therefore, the Company made no scheduled principal payments during 2014 or 2013. 
The senior secured term loan facility also requires mandatory prepayments based on a percentage of excess cash flow generated by 
FDC. All obligations under the senior secured loan facility arc fully and unconditionally guaranteed by most of the domestic, wholly owned 
material subsidiaries of FDC, subject to certain exceptions
