Opinion: Trump Administration's Lie Detector Campaign Against Leakers Threatens National Security 
Priorities 
An opinion piece published by The Conversation (07/09, O'Neill) reported that the Trump administration's 
campaign to use polygraphs to uncover leaks to the press is unlikely to succeed due to the subjective nature of 
polygraph results. Polygraphs measure physiological responses, but there are no specific reactions associated with 
lying, and results are not generally admissible in U.S. courts. The author assessed that the use of polygraphs may 
have a chilling effect, discouraging internal candor and diverting energy away from national security priorities, 
potentially hindering institutional resilience and adaptation to complex threats. The article noted that at agencies 
such as the DHS and the FBI, polygraphs are reportedly being used more frequently — and more punitively — to 
identify internal dissenters. 
Opinion: Counterintelligence in the Absence of Evidence 
An opinion piece published by Clearance Jobs (07/09, Burgess) reported that the British Security Service's 
Operation Wedlock was a decades-long surveillance campaign sparked by a CIA tip about a potential MI6 mole, 
with no direct evidence ever found. The operation's logic was influenced by James Jesus Angleton's worldview, 
which held that the absence of evidence could indicate a skilled concealment, leading to a mole hunt that 
damaged trust and careers. The cases of Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen, and Yuri Nosenko illustrate the dangers of 
recursive logic and the need for 360-degree vision in counterintelligence, where the search for certainty can lead to 
distortion and false accusations. The article highlighted that the cases of Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen, who 
were both found to be moles within the CIA and FBI, respectively, are also examined, and it is noted that these 
breaches were not detected through the use of intuition or speculation, but rather through concrete evidence and 
careful investigation. 
Major Colleges Face Heat Over Chinese Scholarship Ties as Espionage Concerns Mount 
Fox News (07/09, Phillips) reported that the China Select Committee is investigating major U.S. universities, 
including Dartmouth, Notre Dame, and the University of California system, over their ties to the Chinese 
Scholarship Council (CSC). According to the article, the committee alleges that the CSC program is a covert pipeline 
for Beijing to gain access to sensitive American research and technology, and may be indirectly subsidized by U.S. 
federal research grants. The article noted that Universities such as Notre Dame and Dartmouth have already 
terminated or plan to end their participation in the CSC program, amid concerns over potential espionage and 
technology transfer. The article did not contain a direct FBI mention.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Live Entertainment CEO Indicted for Orchestrating Conspiracy to Rig Bidding Process for Public University 
Arena 
KOMO News (07/09, Staff Writer) reported that a federal grand jury has indicted Timothy J. Leiweke, Co-Founder 
and Chief Executive Officer of Oak View Group (OVG), for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to rig the bidding 
process for an arena at a public university in Austin, Texas, the DOJ's Antitrust Division announced. According to the 
article, the indictment, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, claims that from 
approximately February 2018 through at least June 2024, Leiweke conspired with the Chief Executive Officer of a 
competitor. The Dal said the alleged conspiracy involved rigging the bidding for the development, management, 
and use of a multi-purpose arena on the university's campus, referred to as the "Arena Project." "Timothy Leiweke 
allegedly led a scheme designed to steer the contract for entertainment services at a public university's arena to his 
company. Public contracts are subject to laws requiring an open and competitive bid process to ensure a level 
playing field," said Assistant Director in Charge Christopher G. Raia of the FBI New York Field Office. "The FBI is 
determined to ensure that those who disregard fair competition principles do not benefit from a rigged bidding 
process targeting our communities and public institutions." The Seattle Times (07/09, Bernard), KUSA (NBC-
9) (07/09, Snyder), KXAN (NBC-4) (07/09, Jones), and the Wrap (07/09, Patton) also reported on the story.
