adoptive parents, Laird and Mary Hodge. When she was 5, the Hodges told her she was adopted. At 
18, Linda employed a service to help her find her birth parents. 
Three years later and only about 30 miles away, she found her biological mother in Escondido, 
California. 
She wrote to Myra Westphall, telling her that she was healthy and wanted to find out about her 
heritage. Westphall eventually answered the letter with a phone call. "It was an emotional 
conversation that led to our meeting," Linda testified in her deposition. 
Westphall told Linda that in 1968, she'd had a fling with McMahan while both were living in 
Southern California. When McMahan married second wife Melinda Ewell on January 3, 1969, 
Westphall was already pregnant. She gave birth to Linda five months later, on May 29, 1969. 
Westphall, who tells New Times she's now in the publishing business, did not want to discuss her 
relationship with McMahan or her daughter. "I'm just the biological mother: she says. 'She has a 
mother. I gave her up for adoption at birth." 
In 1990, though, Westphall did help Linda locate her father. At the time, Linda was a 21-year-old 
sophomore psychology major at San Diego State University. One day, McMahan telephoned her. She 
assumed Westphall had given him the number. 
In her deposition, Linda described this telephone call as another emotional one. McMahan told his 
daughter what he did for a living and said he wanted to meet her. When they met, he also asked 
her to take a paternity test, saying his lawyers were insisting on it. He got the confirmation — with 
99.7 percent certainty — that he was seeking. 
It was then that McMahan took Linda into the family fold. He helped pay her tuition, set up a trust 
fund for her, and began including her in family holiday celebrations. He added her name to his list 
of children in his professional biographies. 
Eight years into their relationship, Linda was about to earn her PhD in psychology from the 
California School of Professional Psychology in San Diego. 
That's when McMahan had Linda over to his New York home and asked her to watch the first half 
hour of Braveheart. 
That same spring, in 1998, Linda began dating a man named Sargent Schutt whom she met at a 
party in San Diego. In only a few months, the relationship had become serious. But that summer, 
she accepted her father's invitation to fly to London on a business trip. 
They stayed in the Sheraton Belgravia for a week. In her April deposition, she described the trip. 
After their arrival, she testified, a discussion about how Linda could help him with business turned 
personal as the two sipped wine. He told her he was disappointed in her career choice in 
psychology. 
"He offered me an opportunity for business that would incorporate my interest in brain studies 
with his interest in psychic phenomena," she testified. 
They were still jet-lagged from their trip, so McMahan suggested they take a nap. When she woke 
up, The was touching my leg and becoming physical with me." Later in the week, the two had 
sexual intercourse for the first time, she testified. 
After the trip, according to e-mails submitted in court documents, they mailed each other 
vibrators. Referring to one he sent his daughter, McMahan e-inailed her on September 10, 1998: 1 
unpacked the toys and checked them out. The thing excites me just looking at it. I promise you 
have never seen anything like it. Interestingly 'it' is actually smaller than I am! But what moves! I 
should have been so lucky. They are now packed into their own bag and I am going to make sure 
we have enough AA batteries to last for the duration."
