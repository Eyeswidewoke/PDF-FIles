New OPEN Savings' Benefit Option 
Effective immediately, the OPEN Savings benefit terms are deleted and replaced with the following: 
OPEN Savings Terms and Conditions 
The OPEN Savings' benefit is built in to all Business Cards from American Express OPEN. Business Cardmembers 
automatically get discounts of up to 10% or up to 4 additional Membership Rewards- points for each eligible dollar spent 
when they use their Business Card for payment at participating OPEN Savings merchants. 
General Benefit Terms 
• 
To take advantage of the OPEN Savings benefit, payment must be made with a Business Card from American 
Express OPEN. 
• If your Card Account is not eligible for or enrolled in the Membership Rewards program, you will receive the 
OPEN Savings benefit as a discount that will be provided as a statement credit to that Card Account. If your 
Card Account is enrolled in the Membership Rewards program, you have the choice of receiving your OPEN 
Savings benefit either as a discount or as additional Membership Rewards points. See the Benefit Selection 
paragraph below for important information about how to make your choice. 
• 
Purchases made by all Cards under a particular Card Account (including the Basic Card as well as any 
Additional or Employee Cards) are combined for the purposes of calculating the OPEN Savings benefit. The 
OPEN Savings benefit is credited to the Basic Card account holder only. Please allow up to12 weeks for your 
benefit to appear on your monthly statement. 
• 
Purchases that are eligible for the OPEN Savings benefit that are returned or credited from an OPEN Savings 
merchant will result in a reversal of your discount or removal of additional Membership Rewards points 
depending on your benefit selection at the time of the return or credit. See the How Returns Work paragraph 
below for important information and examples of how returns and credits are handled in the program. Please 
review your monthly billing statement in order to confirm proper crediting of returns or credits. If you believe that 
a return or credit has not been properly credited to your account, please call the number on the back of your 
Card 
• 
OPEN Savings offers may be subject to exclusions, benefit limits and other restrictions or limitations. 
Not all OPEN Savings merchant locations may participate in the program. For a full list of current OPEN 
Savings merchants and benefit terms, please visit opensavings.com. The OPEN Savings benefit (including 
benefit terms, merchant participation and offers) is subject to change at any time without notice. 
Benefit Selection 
If your Card Account is enrolled in the Membership Rewards program, you can make your benefit selection by going 
to opensavings.com or calling the number on the back of your Card. The relative value of the benefit options will 
differ depending on how you use your Membership Rewards points. The redemption value of additional 
points that you receive under the Membership Rewards Points Benefit may be less than the dollar value of 
statement credits that you receive under the Discount Benefit. You can change your OPEN Savings benefit 
selection a maximum of once per calendar month Changes normally take effect within 48 hours but may take up to 
2 weeks. Any changes will be applied to all purchases and returns made on or after the date that your change 
becomes effective. Selections will be applied to all OPEN Savings merchants (except for Marriott` properties). 
Marriott' properties do not participate in the Membership Rewards benefit so you will continue to receive discounts 
for eligible purchases at Magnate' properties that participate in the OPEN Savings benefit regardless of your benefit 
selection.
