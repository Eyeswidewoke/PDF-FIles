proportion of non-local effects are high enough, but this is very unlikely to be the case here. More-
over the effects that do occur are subtle and not easily measured, one for example is a slight change 
in the temperature of phase transitions. It is hard to imagine making a measurement that could 
detect non-local interactions through a small change in the temperature of some phase transition 
in the nuclear matter making up the star, as this is already likely to be in phenomena already pa-
rameterized by some phenomenological model of the equation of state of the gas or nuclear matter 
making up the star or neutron star. 
In any case, to study the possibility of observable effects due to n-locality is a research problem, 
which would be interesting to carry out. Given that the result is very unlikely to be significant, 
because that n intersecting triples are a set of measure zero, it would be premature to speculate 
that any observable effect is produced. 
6 Conclusions 
The main aim of this paper has been to show how paradoxes of locality can be generated in at 
least one approach to DSR-that based on free particles in n-Minkowski spacetime-but only at 
the classical level, and to propose that when the quantum dynamics are taken into account those 
paradoxes may be resolved. I was able to provide partial evidence, but not proof, in support of 
this hypothesis. 
I also investigated the possibility that the notion of locality be generalized to a notion appropri-
ate to the physics of classical particles described by worldlines in the non-commutative geometry 
of x-Minkowski spacetime. 
The conclusions can, in more detail, be stated as follows. 
• In section 3.4 we showed how to generate classical paradoxes of locality, by using the de-
pendence of the Lorentz transformations on energy, momentum and angular momentum. 
We considered a case of two or more particles which coincide in one observers frame, and 
found expressions for their differences in space and time coordinates as seen in a second 
frame, given by equations (45) and (46). 
• In section 4.4.1 we set up the quantum theory for a free relativistic particle in K—Minkowski 
spacetime, computed the propagation of a Gaussian wavepacket, defined initially in mo-
mentum space, transformed to spacetime, and found that there is an anomalous spreading 
of the wavepacket given by (62). This is proportional to Ipthplh. 
Thus, we can conclude that the classical paradox is resolved for quantum states in which 
Ap > 'pi. On the other hand, if ap ≤ IpI then the paradoxes may remain. What is the 
meaning of this? 
Since we are working with a gaussian wavepacket, and we can assume that E << Ep, we 
find that the paradoxes are resolved so long as biz < A, where A = h/p is the wavelength of 
light. This means that the particle picture is preferred to the wave picture because the photon 
(or massless particle) can be localized to within its wavelength. We may argue that this is 
the regime where a single propagating photon can be treated as a quantum free relativistic 
particle, which is the approximation we are employing here.
