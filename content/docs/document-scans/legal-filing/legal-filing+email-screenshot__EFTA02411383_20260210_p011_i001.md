that would dilute their stakes. The banks are not keen either, since restructuring would require them to write 
down the value of the debt on their balance-sheet just as they are struggling to improve their capital ratios. Many 
loans are therefore limping towards maturity in a process known as "extend and pretend" or "delay and pray". 
Signs of economic recovery and the support schemes organised by central banks have eased this process along. 
The prices of distressed debt have increased substantially since the dark days of 2008. But there is still a pile of 
debt that needs to be refinanced over the next decade. With the old CDO/CLO machine damaged and with banks 
more cautious about risking their capital, trouble could still lie ahead. 
The unkindest cuts 
Many countries face the difficult choice of upsetting the markets or upsetting their voters

CALL it the rich-uncle theory. When the private sector struggles, governments often step in to pick up the bill. 
And when individual countries have trouble meeting their commitments, they turn to their neighbours, or to the 
International Monetary Fund, for help. 
The recent recession, and the financial crisis that precipitated it, have led to a sharp increase in government debt 
in the developed world, on a scale virtually unprecedented outside world wars. For some states this burden has 
arisen at a time when their finances were already stretched. And for most countries in the rich world this has 
happened when they are having to face up to a range of problems associated with ageing populations. 
Countries have long had a complicated relationship with their national debt. It was the need to repair its national 
finances that forced the ancient regime of Louis XVI in France to summon the Estates-General in 1789, an 
event that triggered the French revolution. In his book, "A Free Nation Deep in Debt", James Macdonald argues 
that the national debt was a source of strength for countries such as Britain and the Netherlands, whose 
governments were financed by merchants and bankers. In wartime such countries could easily outspend those run 
by aristocrats, which had a history of default. For Britain and the Netherlands there was no incentive to default on 
the debt owed to the classes that controlled them. 
During the first and second world wars governments on both sides of the conflict exploited the patriotism of their 
citizens, persuading them to buy "victory" bonds and the like. Those same governments then penalised the 
patriots by inflating away their debt after the war. From 1945 onward government debt became a tool of economic 
management as Keynesian deficit spending was used to cushion economies during recessions. The booms of the 
1980s and 1990s led to a surge in tax revenues and kept the debt problem under control. But the recent financial 
crisis caused some of the biggest deficits recorded in peacetime. The debt-to-GDP ratio of the G7 group of nations 
is at its highest level for 60 years (see chart 5). 
That has started to raise questions about whether countries can actually meet the bill. Allowing governments to
