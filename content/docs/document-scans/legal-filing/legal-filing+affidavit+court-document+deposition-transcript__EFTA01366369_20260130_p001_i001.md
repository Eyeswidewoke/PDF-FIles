We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of 
the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholder to assist them in assessing the target 
business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We 
cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to 
prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be mct, we 
may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition 
candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 
as required by the Sarbancs-Oxley Act. Only in the event we arc deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an 
accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not 
be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbancs-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The 
development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may 
increase the time and costs necessary• to complete any such acquisition. 
Prior to the date of this prospectus, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to 
voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the 
rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to 
suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our 
business combination. 
We are an "emerging growth company." as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the 
JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements 
that are applicable to other public companies that arc not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited 
to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy 
statements. and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive 
compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments 
100 
not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, them may be a Ins active 
trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging growth company" can take 
advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2XB) of the Securities Act for complying 
with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption 
of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to 
take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (I) the last day of the fiscal year (a) 
following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering. (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue 
of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market 
value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30Th, and (2) the 
date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
References herein to "emerging growth company" shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
Legal Proceedings 
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any 
members of our management team in their capacity as such, and we and the members of our management team
