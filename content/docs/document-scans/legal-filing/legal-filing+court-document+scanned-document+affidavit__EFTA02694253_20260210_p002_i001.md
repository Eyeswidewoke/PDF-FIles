credibly accused, be given a fair trial for their roles in the most serious crimes. 
Gadhafi took power in 1969 and his rule encompassed an appalling catalog of human rights abuses, 
at home and abroad. The massacre of an estimated 1,200 prisoners after a failed revolt at Tripoli's 
Abu Salim prison in 1996 is perhaps the most notorious episode of domestic abuse. Abroad, he was 
best-known for his alleged involvement in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, 
which killed 270 people. 
Since 1969, Libya has suffered forced disappearances, politically motivated arrests and the use of 
torture, as well as the near-total repression of freedom of expression and association. Gadhafi's 
Libya was one of the region's most thorough police states, and his unique political system, the 
Jamahiriya, or "state of the masses," obviated the need for elections. 
Where are Gadhafi's assets? 
Now that he is gone and Libya has officially been liberated after the fall of Sine, the clock starts on 
the transition to a new government. The National Transitional Council said it plans to organize free 
elections and rewrite the constitution. It has pledged that Libya will respect international human 
rights standards. 
Libya's new leaders have an extraordinary opportunity to rebuild the country based on the rule of 
law, where the rights of all are respected, including those of women, minorities and supporters of 
the old regime. It's vital, for instance, that the new constitution enshrines the right to gender 
equality and nondiscrimination, and that women are able to participate fully in the political process, 
during the transition and beyond. The new authorities will need to abolish or revise numerous laws, 
including those that limit free expression and association and restrict political parties. And they will 
need to rewrite the penal code and reorganize the judicial system and the security services. 
But Libya will need international help to build a credible, unified state that can protect all its 
inhabitants. The transitional authorities have already spoken out against revenge attacks. They also 
need to ensure that those now being detained are treated humanely, and those responsible for abuses 
are investigated and fairly prosecuted. 
Human Rights Watch has already documented some of the difficulties any new government will 
face, such as how to set up and administer lawful and humane detention facilities. We have 
investigated incidents of torture by forces allied to the transitional council, as well as revenge 
attacks against communities who are considered pro-Gadhafi. And we have spoken to women (and 
men) victimized during the conflict by sexual violence, a taboo subject in Libya. The new 
authorities need to ensure that appropriate care and support are offered to women and girls 
subjected to such violence, and help to create an environment in which people feel able to report 
rape and other attacks. 
The Libyan authorities should be setting up independent, impartial investigations into the most 
serious crimes of the past four decades, and also cooperate with the International Criminal Court, 
which is examining abuses since February 15, 2011. There have been many, implicating both sides. 
On Thursday we visited the graveyard in Sine and learned that of the 52 bodies buried this week, at
