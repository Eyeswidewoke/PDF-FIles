2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129842, * 
Additionally, defendant's website, while not sufficiently interactive to establish general 
personal jurisdiction, does suggest that defendant intended to transact business in specific 
state markets. As first enunciated in Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Corn, 
(tjhe likelihood that personal jurisdiction can be constitutionally exercised is directly proportionate to the nature and 
quality of the commercial activity that an entity con do:is over the Internet. This skiing scale is consistent with well 
developed personal jurisdiction principles. At one end of the spectrum are situations where a defendant clearly does 
business over the Internet. If the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the 
knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the Internet. personal jurisdiction is proper. At the opposite 
end are situations r10] where a defendant has simply posted information on an Internet Web site which is accessible 
to users of foreign jurisdictions. A passive Web site that does little more than make information available to those who 
are interested in it is not grounds for the exercise of personal jurisdiction. The middle ground is occupied by interactive 
Web sites where a user can exchange information with the host computer. In these cases the exercise of jurisdiction is 
determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on 
the Web site. 
952 F. Supp. 1119, 1124 (W.D. Penn. 1997). Defendant's website falls within the "middle 
ground" because although consumers cannot order its products over the website, they are 
able to browse defendant's product selection, "find out more" about the company through a 
request form, and locate nearby authorized dealers and distributors. See Barton Southern 
Co. v. Manhole Barrier Systems, 318 F. Supp. 2d 1174, 1177 (N.D. Ga. 2004). Through its 
"Dealer Locator Program," defendant promises dealers that it will "bring potential local 
Coffman customers to [their] door" by allowing consumers to enter their zip codes on the 
website and access a list of authorized dealers in the area. See Coffman Stairs - Dealer 
Programs, http://www.coffmanstairs.com/dealer/dealer2.htm. rig Rather than merely 
placing its products into the stream of commerce, defendant directs customers, including 
those residing in Georgia, to its authorized local dealers and distributors. 
Finally, the exercise of jurisdiction over defendant comports with traditional notions of fair 
play and substantial justice. In assessing the reasonableness of a forum's assertion of 
jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, the court considers: 
(1) the burden on defendant in litigating the lawsuit. (2) the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute; (3) the 
plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief. (4) the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the 
most efficient resolution of controversies: and (5) the shared interest of the states in furthering fundamental social 
policies. 
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 292, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 
2d 490 (1980). Georgia is the most convenient forum for plaintiff, who resided in Georgia 
during his employment with defendant and remains a resident of this state. Georgia also 
has an interest in protecting against and adjudicating contract disputes that involve, at 
least partially, transactions with Georgia companies and that occur within the state. 
"[O]ften the interests of the plaintiff and the ri2] forum in the exercise of jurisdiction will 
justify even the serious burdens placed on the alien defendant." Asahi Metal Industry Co. 
v. Superior Court of California, 480 U.S. 102, 114, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1987). 
Plaintiff has agreed to conduct depositions in Virginia or North Carolina to diminish the 
inconvenience to defendant. The court, therefore, finds that defendant will not be seriously 
burdened by defending this lawsuit in Georgia. 
Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction [4-1] is hereby 
DENIED. 
IT IS SO ORDERED, this 18th day of March, 2008.
