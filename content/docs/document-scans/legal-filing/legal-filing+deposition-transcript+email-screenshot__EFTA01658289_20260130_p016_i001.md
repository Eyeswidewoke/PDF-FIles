her death hit him, quote, 'very hard." Trump "pledged to get to the bottom of what happened 
to her." The AP (7/30, Superville) points out Trump also said "he would help with funeral 
expenses." The AP quotes Trump as saying, "It's an incredible story. It's a terrible story. ... So 
we're going to look into it very powerfully. We already have started, as you know, and we'll get 
to the bottom of it. Maybe things can come out that will help other people in a situation like 
Vanessa. We'll be in touch with you constantly." The Washington Post (7/30, Wagner, Horton, 
14.2M) notes Trump also said, "We didn't want to have this swept under the rug, which could 
happen." He also called Guillen "a spectacular person" who was "respected and loved by 
everybody." 
The Hill (7/30, Chalfant, 2.98M) reports "the Army specialist went missing from the Texas 
military base in late April. Her remains were found more than two months later, on June 30, 
buried 20 miles away from Ford Hood near a lake." The Hill adds "authorities suspect another 
soldier, Aaron Robinson, in Guillen's death." Robinson "killed himself on July 1 after he was 
confronted by police." 
USA Today (7/30, Brook, 10.31M) reports "the independent review" into Guillen's death 
"will be led by Chris Swecker, a lawyer and former assistant director of the FBI's Criminal 
Investigative Division." Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said in a statement, "The Army is 
committed to taking care of our soldiers, civilians, families, and soldiers for life, and this 
independent review will explore the current command climate and culture at Fort Hood." USA 
Today adds "earlier this month, Army officials disclosed that Guillen may have been harassed in 
an unrelated matter to her disappearance and murder. That matter is under investigation." 
Stars And Stripes (7/30, Wentling, 30K) reports that also on Thursday, "the 16-year-old 
sister of a slain Army specialist took the stage in front of 100 people on the National Mall in 
Washington...and fervently demanded Congress pass reforms to prevent more deaths." 
Guillen's "family, along with their attorney, Natalie Khawam, gathered outside the Capitol on the 
National Mall to announce the #IamVanessaGuillen bill," a measure that "would allow service 
members to file claims of sexual harassment and assault to a third-party agency, rather than 
through the chain of command." 
CNN (7/30, Sanchez, 83.16M) reports, "The independent review is intended to determine 
whether that climate and culture 'reflects the Army's values, including safety, respect, 
inclusiveness, and a commitment to diversity, and workplaces and communities free from 
sexual harassment.' The panel, with assistance from a brigadier general and a staff, will study 
'historical data and conduct interviews with military members, civilians and members of the 
local community." Members of the panel include Swecker, "Jonathan Harmon, a trial lawyer who 
has represented Fortune 500 companies across the country; Carrie Ricci, an assistant general 
counsel for the US Department of Agriculture; Queta Rodriguez, a Bexar County, Texas, 
resident and regional director for FourBlock, a nonprofit that helps veterans transition into 
civilian careers; and Jack White, an attorney with expertise in government investigations and 
discrimination claims." 
ABC News (7/30, Martinez, Seyler, 2.97M) reports, "McCarthy announced the review two 
weeks ago following a meeting with members of the League of United Latin American Citizens 
and two members of Congress to discuss the issues surrounding the investigation into Guillen's 
death. The panel's findings will be submitted to James McPherson, under secretary of the Army, 
and Gen. Joseph Martin, the vice chief of staff of the Army, who will co-chair an implementation 
team to consider the recommendations and implement any changes, as needed." 
FBI Joins Army Probe Of Killing Of Fort Bragg Paratrooper. 
The Fayetteville (NC) Observer (7/30, DeVane, 151K) reports, "The FBI is helping Army 
investigators try to determine who killed a Fort Bragg paratrooper." The Observer adds, "The 
investigation into the death of Spc. Enrique Roman-Martinez is a priority for Army Criminal 
Investigation Command and the 82nd Airborne Division, according to a statement released 
Thursday by the division. Roman-Martinez was camping with fellow paratroopers on an island at
