should be read together with, the description of the general terms and provisions of our debt securities set forth 
in the accompanying prospectus under the caption "Description of the Debt Securities." Any infonnotion 
regarding tire debentures contained in this prospectus supplement that is inconsistent with information in the 
accompanying prospectus will supersede any inconsistent information in the accompanying prospectus. The 
following description does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference 
to, the subordinated indenture, as supplemented by the second supplemental indenture, to provide for the 
issuance of the debentures which we collectively refer to as the "indenture." between W. R. Berkley Corporation, 
as issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, which we refer to as the "trustee." pursuant to which 
the debentures will be issued.

aggregate principal amount to S

debentures of such series being offered by this prospectus supplement, provided that the additional debentures 
arc fungible with the debentures being offered in this prospectus supplement for United States federal income tax 
purposes. Any additional debentures, together with the debentures offered by this prospectus supplement, will 
constitute a single series of debt securities under the indenture. The debentures and the indenture under which the 
debentures will be issued do not place any limitation on the amount of unsecured debt that may be incurred by us.

on a Parity with the Debentures, and, in each case in the manner set forth below. The debentures will also be 
structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.
