Depositary may retain tendered Shares on Purchaser's behalf, and such Shares may not be withdrawn except to 
the extent that tendering shareholders are entitled to withdrawal rights as described herein. 
Withdrawals of Shares may not be rescinded. Any Shares properly withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not 
to have been validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be re-tendered again by 
following one of the procedures described in Section 3 —"Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering 
Shares" at any time prior to the Expiration Time. 
No withdrawal rights will apply to Shares tendered during the Subsequent Offering Period (as it may be

Period (as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period) with respect to Shares tendered in the Offer 
and accepted for payment. See Section 1 —'Terms of the Offer." 
Purchaser will determine, in its sole discretion, all questions as to the form and validity (including 
time of receipt) of any notice of withdrawal. Purchaser also reserves the absolute right to waive any defect 
or irregularity in the withdrawal of any Shares by any particular shareholder, regardless of whether or 
not similar defects or irregularities are waived or not waived in the case of other shareholders. None of 
Purchaser, the Depositary, the information Agent. or any other person will be under any duty to give 
notice of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to give 
any such notification. Any determinations made by us with respect to the terms and conditions of the Offer
