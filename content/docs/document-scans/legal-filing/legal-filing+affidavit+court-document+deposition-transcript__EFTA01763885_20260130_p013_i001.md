For the next 18 mon=hs, Mr. Castro prepared for nuclear Armageddon, while Kennedy and Khrushch=v sleepwalked 
toward the abyss. Focused on their global competition, the United States and the Soviet Union were clue=ess about the 
mind-set of the smaller, weaker, poorer party. Kennedy wante= Cuba off his agenda and he resolved never again to cave 
in to his hawkish=advisers and critics, who had continued clamoring for an invasion of the island, even after the Bay of 
Pigs disast=r. 
Khrushchev, for his=part, was worried about "losing Cuba" and decided in early 1962 to off=r nuclear missiles to Mr. 
Castro to deter the invasion they both believed was being planned but that Kennedy was private=y resolved to avoid. 
But as Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs, the Soviet Un=on never intended to actually use the missiles; they were merely 
pawns in = game of superpower competition. 
However, Mr. Castro=believed the fundamental purpose of Soviet was to=destroy the United States in the event of an 
invasion. After centuries of =umiliation and irrelevance, he concluded, Cuba would matter fundamentally to the fate of 
humanity. Cuba couldn't p=event the onslaught, nor could it expect to survive it. He insisted that t=e Cubans and 
Russians on the island would resist "to the last day and th= last man, woman or child capable of holding a weapon." 
Around noon on Oct.=26, Mr. Castro summoned the Soviet ambassador, Aleksandr Alekseev, to his =ommand post. Mr. 
Castro couldn't understand why Soviet troops in Cuba were sitting on their hands while American plane= were flying 
over the island with impunity. He urged them to start shootin= at U-2 spy planes with surface-to-air missiles and 
suggested that Cuban t=oops should begin firing on low-flying planes with antiaircraft guns, contrary to Soviet wishes. 
Alekseev promise= to relay Mr. Castro's complaints to the Kremlin. Alekseev later told us=he felt "almost schizophrenic" 
when he sent the cables to Moscow, beca=se it was his duty to represent the cautious Soviet position, yet he himself, 
like Mr. Castro, expected an American ons=aught. At that moment, "I was almost 100 percent Cuban," he recalled. 
While Cuba was prep=ring for nuclear war, Khrushchev and Kennedy were, unbeknown to Mr. Castro= moving toward a 
peaceful resolution of the crisis. Terrified that a catastrophic war might break out, Khrushchev took=the initiative even 
as Kennedy was preparing an offer of his own. He wrote=to Kennedy on Oct. 26: "Let us then display statesmenlike 
wisdom. I prop=se: we, for our part, will declare that our ships bound for Cuba are not carrying any armaments. You will 
dec=are that the United States will not invade Cuba with its troops and will n=t support any other forces which might 
intend to invade Cuba. Then the nec=ssity for the presence of our military specialists in Cuba will be obviated." It would 
take another three agoni=ing weeks to work out the details, but Kennedy and Khrushchev had finally =ocked onto a 
common wavelength. 
All these letters (=xcept those delivered over the radio at the peak of the crisis) were metho=ically dictated, translated, 
encrypted and then transmitted. Such slow communication in a time of crisis seems inconc=ivable today, but at the 
heart of the cold war absolute secrecy was the ob=ective, not speed. (It was only after the missile crisis that the "red 
p=one" hot line between the White House and the Kremlin was installed.) 
Unaware of Kennedy=92s and Khrushchev's progress toward a deal, at 2 a.m. on Oct. 27, Mr. C=stro decided to write to 
Khrushchev, encouraging him to use his nuclear weapons to destroy the United States in the event o= an invasion. At 3 
a.m., he arrived at the Soviet Embassy and told Aleksee= that they should go into the bunker beneath the embassy 
because an attack=was imminent. According to declassified Soviet cables, a groggy but sympathetic Alekseev agreed, 
and soon they wer= set up underground with Castro dictating and aides transcribing and trans=ating a letter. 
Mr. Castro became f=ustrated, uncertain about what to say. After nine drafts, with the sun ris=ng, Alekseev finally 
confronted Mr. Castro: are you asking Comrade Khrushchev to deliver a nuclear strike on the Unite= States? Mr. Castro 
told him, "If they attack Cuba, we should wipe them =ff the face of the earth!" Alekseev was shocked, but he dutifully 
assist=d Mr. Castro in fine-tuning the 10th and final draft of the letter. 
From his bunker, Mr= Castro wrote that, in the event of an American invasion, "the danger th=t that aggressive policy 
poses for humanity is so great that following that event the Soviet Union must never allow th= circumstances in which 
the imperialists could launch the first nuclear st=ike against it." An invasion, he added, "would be the moment to
