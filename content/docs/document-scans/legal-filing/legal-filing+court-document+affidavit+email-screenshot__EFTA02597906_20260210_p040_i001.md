You may only check one box. If you check more than one box or no boxes, the= you will not be deemed to have validly 
tendered your Shares. If you wish to tender portions of your Share holdings at different prices, you must corn ple=e a

tender the same Shares at more than one price (unless you previously tendered and withdrew those Shares, a= provided 
in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase). 
6. Odd Lots. As described in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase, if the Company purchases less than all Shares tendered 
and not withdrawn before th= Expiration Date, the Shares purchased first will consist of all Shares tendered by any 
stockholder who owned beneficially, as of the close of business on May 3, 1999, an aggregate of fewer than 100 Shares
