785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
work-environment class is to reinstate a suspect revision of the "across-the-board" rule 
that the Supreme Court rejected three decades ago. See Falcon, 457 U.S. at 153, 157-59 
(rejecting the idea that "an employee complaining of ['956] one employment practice" 
may automatically "represent another complaining of another practice" merely because 
both alleged discrimination based on the same protected trait). The district court did not 
abuse its discretion in refusing to exhume that long-dead idea. 
The district court did not clearly err in declining to give dispositive weight to evidence going 
to Plaintiffs' hostile-work-environment claim when deciding whether to certify Plaintiffs' 
separate promotions-related classes. 
When closely examined, Plaintiffs' anecdotal evidence proves to be just as unconvincing 
as their statistical proof. "Because [Plaintiffs] provide no convincing proof of a 
companywide discriminatory . . . promotion policy, . . . they have not established the 
existence of any ("155] common question." Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2556-57. The district 
court therefore did not abuse its discretion in declining to certify the class because of its 
lack of commonality. 
IV. 
On the road to its desired result, the majority undermines well-established judicial 
processes, causes a rift between this Court and a co-equal circuit court without 
explanation, and brings substantial uncertainty to an area of law that begs for clarity. 
As to judicial processes, the majority opinion evidences little respect for the role of the 
district court and the standard of review. The district court has lived with this matter for 
several years now, and it best understands how the case has developed. Its actions 
bespeak a court striving to scrupulously apply Rule 23's requirements. The district court 
complied with our mandate, rejected more than one request to decertify from Nucor, and 
continually endeavored to respect findings that this Court has (actually) made. Yet the 
majority shows no concern for that effort. And it shows just as little concern for this Court's 
well-established waiver rule, which should plainly apply here. 
As to our sister circuits, the majority opinion begets a circuit split. The Eighth Circuit 
affirmed the denial of ("156] class certification in a case involving the same claims, the 
same experts, and the same defendant. As should be clear by now, that decision cannot 
be reconciled with this one. The majority never even tries to do so. 
And as to cases to come, the majority's decision will offer far more questions than 
answers. What standard of review really applies in this context? How much evidence must 
a plaintiff summon to comply with Rule 23? Does appellate waiver matter? Does class 
treatment of one cause of action necessarily warrant class treatment for another? Must 
statistical evidence prove to be reliable? Does Wal-Mart reach only nationwide class 
actions? Can a sufficiently "common" policy result from inaction? These are only some of 
the questions that the majority opinion leaves unresolved. 
We should hardly take this troubled road in the name of "simple justice." Maj. op. at 63.
