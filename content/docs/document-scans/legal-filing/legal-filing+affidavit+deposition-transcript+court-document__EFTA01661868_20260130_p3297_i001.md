Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions. including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are derived from proprietary 
models based upon well-recognized financial principles and we have, when necessary to calculate the present value of future cash flows, made reasonable estimates about relevant future market 
conditions. Valuations based on other models or different assumptions may yield different results. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates 
used in deriving the valuations. (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information
