Global Equities 
— With global risks (e.g. Greece/China) apparently 
fading, U.S. equities have taken their direction from 
fundamentals (e.g. earnings), as well as the outlook 
for economic growth and monetary policy. 
— With —60% of the S&P 500 companies having reported 
Q2 2015 earnings, the S&P 500 has been able to rally 
as earnings have come in —4% better than expected. 
— In addition, while earnings are on pace to come in 
modestly negative in Q2 (-1% YoY) the bulk of the 
weakness has been in the commodity sectors. In fact, 
earnings and revenues excluding energy are on pace 
to rise (+5% and +2% YoY, respectively). 
— Although the Q2 earnings season has been better 
than expected, we caution investors against getting 
complacent in the current environment. 
— Valuations (P/E LTM) remain near a 5YR high and 
economic data has been mixed as seen by the 
Citigroup Economic Surprise Index improving but still 
in negative territory. In addition, the first Fed rate hike 
remains on the table for September which has 
historically fueled volatility and August has been the 
weakest month for equities over the past 20 years.

10-year U.S. Treasuries have been in a tight range as 
the eventuality of rate hikes has been overshadowed 
by disinflation fears as commodity prices have declined 
and economic data has been mixed. 
The sector that has seen the most pronounced 
movement has been high yield as it is on pace to post 
its first back-to-back monthly losses in two years. 
We continue to like high yield despite the recent 
downturn for several reasons. First, the current spread 
level (—500 bps) is likely reflecting the potential for an 
increase in energy related defaults over the next year. 
Second, sharp losses in high yield have historically 
coincided with a credit event (e.g. Long Term Capital 
Management) or recession. 
With the Fed's eventual tightening cycle to be more 
gradual, economic growth to remain reasonable and 
energy prices to stabilize we see limited risk for either 
event. 
Lastly, corporate America remains healthy and default 
expectations remain historically low.

Equities: With valuations heightened and negative 
seasonality, we remain cautious on equities in the 
near term. 
Fixed Income: Despite recent weakness in high 
yield we remain constructive long term on the 
sector.
