When used with a camera the colposcope can document the trauma without 
additional examinations of the child victim. Positive laboratory tests for sexually 
transmitted d'seases can be valuable evidence especially in cases involving young 
children. Statements made to doctors by the child victim as part of the medical 
examination might be admissible in court without the child testifying. 
Law-enforcement investigators should be cautious of doctors who have been 
identified as child-abuse crusaders or always find —or never find—medical 
evidence of sexual victimization. Medical doctors should be objective scientists 
doing a professional examination. The exact cause of any anal or vaginal trauma 
needs to be evaluated carefully and scientifically. Also many acts of child sexual 
victimization do not leave any physical injuries that can be identified by a medical 
examination. In addition children's injuries can heal rapidly. Thus lack of medical 
corroboration does not mean that a child was not sexually victimized or it cannot 
be proven in court. 
Other Victims 
The simple understanding and recognition that a child molester might have other 
victims is one of the most important steps in corroborating an allegation of child 
sexual victimization. There is strength in numbers. If an investigation uncovers 
one or two victims, each will probably have to testify in court. If an investigation 
uncovers multiple victims, the odds are that none of them will testify because 
there will not be a trial. With multiple victims the only defense is to allege a flawed, 
leading investigation. 
Because of the volume of crime, limited resources, and lack of knowledge 
about the nature of the crime, many law-enforcement agencies are unable or 
unwilling to continue an investigation to find more than a couple of victims. If 
that is the case they must try to identify as many victims as possible. Other vic-
tims are sometimes identified through publicity about the case. Consistency of 
statements obtained from multiple victims, independently interviewed, cart be 
powerful corroboration. 
With preferential acquaintance molesters, especially those who prefer boys, 
the potential for multiple victims can be overwhelming. If there area dozen dis-
closing victims, a mountain of corroborative evidence, and an offender who is 
going to jail for many years, does the investigator have to continue to investigate 
until "all" the victims are found? As previously stated the U.S. Attorney General 
Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance indicates that U.S. Department of Jus-
tice investigators and prosecutors are responsible for identifying and contacting 
all the victims of a crime (U.S. Department of Justice, 2000). The exact meaning 
of this statement is subject to interpretation, but common sense says a decision 
must be made based on a totality of the facts. 
Some unidentified victims may be in need of therapy and counseling. Some, 
however, may be doing fine and dredging up the victimization may cause more 
problems. Some victims may not know or realize that they are victims until 
informed by investigators. Can victims suffer the psychological consequences of 
being victimized if they do not know that they are victims? These are difficult 
issues with no easy answers. Investigators and prosecutors must think about these 
issues and make the best-informed decision.
