offering price of the shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be our historical performance, estimates of our business 
potential and earnings prospects, an assessment of our management, and the consideration of the above factors in relation to 
market valuation of companies in related businesses. 
Our Class A common stock has been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SO". In order 
to meet one of the requirements for listing the Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, the underwriters have 
undertaken to sell lots of 100 or more shares to a minimum of 400 beneficial holders. 
In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of Class A common stock in the open market. 
These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions, and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Shod 
sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering, and a 
short position represents the amount of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A "covered short 
position" is a short position that is not greater than the amount of additional shares

for which the underwriters' option described above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any covered short position by 
either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of 
shares to cover the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for 
purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option 
described above. "Naked" short sales are any short sales that create a short position greater than the amount of additional shares 
for which the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must cover any such naked short position by purchasing 
shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be 
downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who 
purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock made by the 
underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. 
The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a 
portion of the underwriting discount received by it, because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account 
of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. 
Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own 
accounts. may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our stock, and together with the imposition 
of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain, or otherwise affect the market price of the common stock. As a result, the price of the 
Class A common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. The underwriters are not 
required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. These transactions may be effected on the 
New York Stock Exchange, in the over-the-counter market, or otherwise. 
Directed Share Program 
At our request, the underwriters have reserved for sale, at our initial public offering price. up to 5.0% of the Class A common 
stock offered hereby (excluding any additional shares of Class A common stock to be offered by us) to our existing sellers and 
Square Cash customers. The sales will be made under a directed share program through a platform administered by LOYAL3 
Securities, Inc.. which we refer to in this prospectus as the "LOYAL3 Platform." The shares being made available for this program 
are being sold by the Start Small Foundation, a donor-advised fund held and administered by the Silicon Valley Community 
Foundation, the selling stockholder. We do not know if our sellers and Square Cash customers will choose to purchase all or any 
portion of these reserved shares, but any purchases they do make will reduce the number of shares available to the general public. 
Any reserved shares not so purchased will be offered by the underwriters to the general public on the same terms as the other 
shares of Class A common stock offered hereby. None of our directors or executive officers will participate in the directed share 
program. Shares purchased as part of the program will be freely tradable and will not be subject to a lock-up agreement. Any 
purchase of our Class A common stock in this offering through the underwriter administering program will be at the same initial 
public offering price, and at the same time, as any other purchases in this offering, including purchases by institutions and other 
large investors. Such purchases of shares in this offering through the LOYAL3 Platform will be at the initial public offering price, will 
be otherwise fee-free to investors, and will be in dollar amounts that may include fractional shares. Subsequent sales of our 
Class A common stock by investors in this offering using the LOYAL3 Platform will be completed through a batch or combined 
order process typically only once per day. LOYAL3 Securities. Inc. is a U.S.-registered broker-dealer unaffiliated with our company 
and is acting as a co-manager of this offering.
