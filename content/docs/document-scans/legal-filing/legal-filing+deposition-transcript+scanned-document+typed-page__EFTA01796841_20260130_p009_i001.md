Foreign Policy 
Don't be too =ure there won't be another U.S. war in the Middle East 
Richard L. Russell<=span> 
February 5, 2013 --=Shortly before he left office in Feb. 2011, Defense Secretary Robert Gates=told West Point cadets 
that "in my opinion, any future defense secret=ry who advised the president to again send a big American land army 
into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa shoul= 'have his head examined,' as General MacArthur so delicately put 
it.&qu=t; The remark no doubt reflected Sec. Gates's fatigue and frustration from=the enormous intellectual and 
emotional burdens associated with overseeing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
One suspects, howev=r, that in a more reflective moment, Gates would have acknowledged that &q=ot;never say never" 
is a wise rule of thumb in planning for military =ontingencies, especially in the region that makes up Central Command's 
area-of-responsibility. Few, for example, predicted t=e 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Gates himself -- who was a 
senior C=A official during the covert war supporting the Afghan resistance -- surel= did not anticipate then that the 
United States would have to return to Afghanistan two decades later to ous= a Taliban regime that was harboring 
terrorists. Before 1990, moreover, no=one predicted that Iraq, having just ended a bitter eight-year war with Irrn, would 
swing its battered forces south to invade Kuwait. 
So if it's conventi=nal wisdom that the United States will not, or should not, intervene milit=rily in the Middle East or 
South Asia after it draws down forces in Iraq a=d Afghanistan, it's also likely dead wrong. What is true, however, is that 
political and military trajectories =n the Middle East and South Asia are likely to increasingly challenge U.S.=contingency 
access in the coming decade. The ability for the United States=to surge large-scale forces into the region, as it did in the 
1990 and 2003 wars against Iraq, will grow in=reasingly circumscribed. The United States will have to adapt to this new 
=trategic landscape by developing more nimble, highly-mobile, stealthy, and=networked forces, and by abandoning the 
traditional practice of slowly and steadily building up conventional f=rces at regional logistic hubs prior to launching war. 
* * * 
Perhaps the most si=nificant factor that portends against further intervention in the Middle E=st and South Asia is 
increased political resistance -- and outright opposi=ion -- from the countries in the region. That resistance is likely to 
come from the new regimes emerging from the A=ab uprisings, as well as a number of Gulf monarchies. 
Indeed, the politic=l trends in the region are unlikely to conform to the rosy predictions of =emocratic peace theorists, 
whose musings have implicitly informed the secu=ity policies of both Republican and Democratic administrations for 
decades. Old authoritarian regimes seem to =e passing the way of the dodo bird, but the new regimes taking shape are 
h=avily influenced by militant Islamic ideology that will make them less lik=ly to engage in security or military 
cooperation with the United States. 
Democracy optimists=argue that these ideological regimes, once entrenched in power, will have =o moderate their zeal 
in order to govern. Pragmatism will ultimately trump=ideology. That line of reasoning, however, is based on the 
assumption that the policy decisions of such regimes can b= explained by rational choice economic theory. In other 
words, if they wan= to attract international capital and participate in the world economy, th=y are going to have to 
break with their ideological affinities. But that reasoning ignores a hard fact of in=ernational politics: that time and 
again, political and ideological prerog=tives trump economic rationality. It made little economic sense, for examp=e, for 
Pakistan to pursue a nuclear weapons program in the 1970s, just as it makes little economic sense for l=an to do so 
today. Clearly, both Pakistan and Iran made major policy decis=ons based on political-military priorities rather than 
economic calculatio=s.
