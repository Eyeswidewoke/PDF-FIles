underperformance - QEP and SN have been impacted by some weak well 
results (and some weather) while LPI has seen a significant inflation in capex 
budget with minimal impact on production. For one oily player, CRZO, the 
guidance is largely unchanged from start of the year. Moving to the gassy 
names, the performance is mildly negative - RRC's current production 
guidance is 3% below original target while GPOR's capex budget is up 10% 
(minimal production uplift). Only AR outperforms marginally (+3% increase in 
production for 3V0 capex increase). 
Looking at performance by quality categories, we see a broad-based 
outperformance among both Higher Quality and Lower Quality Oily names. 
The High Quality Oily credits have demonstrated solid operating momentum 
(6-14% increase in growth targets). While this reflects the top quality of their 
core assets, this is already factored in. We see the outperformance of the Low 
Quality Oily group as more impactful given relative credit upside - all names 
have lowered their capex (by 4-16%) while maintaining or increasing 
production guidance (except SN, the sole underperformer in the group). Along 
with this, some of these companies have also brought down their opex cost 
structure meaningfully (EPE, MEG, DNR). Overall, it reflects solid improvement 
in their admittedly high cost structures and drives down FCF breakeven oil 
price, which we see as a key metric for this group (discussed below). Among 
the Mid Quality names, the performance has been mixed - WPX and WLL have 
done well while names like OEP and LPI have disappointed.
