44 Misc. 3d 280, *; 982 N.Y.S.2d 868,
2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1404, ***; 2014 NY Slip Op 24083 
On October 24, 2013, Burns filed his instant motion for an order dismissing plaintiffs' 
amended verified complaint. In his motion papers, Bums opposed plaintiffs' motion to 
amend and sought an order denying plaintiffs' motion: 2784 LLC has not [*289] submitted 
any papers with respect to Burns' motion, and it took no position at oral argument. 
' Subsequent to oral argument, the court received a purported "reply" to Burns motion to dismiss which included further 
opposition to plaintiffs'proposed amendment to their amended complaint. These papers have been retected by the court and 
have not been considered (see CPLR 2214 (Ial. (cit. 
In support of their motion to amend, plaintiffs maintained that their proposed amendment 
was meritorious since they were entitled to their full share of distributions from these sale 
proceeds and that the withholding of over $80,000 from their distributions was wrongful 
and improper. Moreover, no prejudice was demonstrated by Burns with respect to the 
proposed amendment since it simply r ..15] streamlines plaintiffs' amended complaint 
and does not assert any new facts or causes of action against Bums. In addition, there 
could be no prejudice to 2784 LLC since, as noted above, it has not as yet served an 
answer in this action, and prejudice to warrant denial of leave to amend requires some 
indication that the defendants were hindered in the preparation of their case or were 
prevented from taking some measure in support of their position (see McGhee v Odell, 96 
AD3d 449, 450, 946 NYS2d 134 [1st Dept 2012]; Kocourek v Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., 85 
AD3d 502, 504, 925 NYS2d 51 ('"875] [1st Dept 2011]). Furthermore, while there was a 
two-year delay by plaintiffs in seeking such leave, discovery is ongoing, and depositions 
have not yet been held (see Rosicki, Rosicki & Assoc., P.C. v Cochems, 59 AD3d 512, 
514, 873 NYS2d 184 [2d Dept 2009]). 
Thus, since [HN1] a motion for leave to amend a complaint should be freely granted, 
absent prejudice or surprise directly resulting from the delay in seeking leave, unless the 
proposed amendment is palpably insufficient or patently devoid of merit (see CPLR 3025 
[b]; Aurora Loan Servs., LLC v Thomas, 70 AD3d 986. 987, 897 NYS2d 140 [2d Dept 
2010]; Lucido v Mancuso, 49 AD3d 220, 222, 851 NYS2d 238 [2d Dept 2008], appeal 
withdrawn ['..16] 12 NY3d 813, 908 NE2d 928, 881 NYS2d 20 [2009]), and, here, the 
proposed amendment was not palpably insufficient or patently devoid of merit and there 
was also no showing of prejudice or surprise resulting directly from plaintiffs' delay in 
seeking leave, the court, at oral argument held on November 20, 2013, granted plaintiffs 
motion for leave to file their second amended verified complaint. While Burns' motion was 
originally directed as against plaintiffs' first amended complaint, since the court has 
granted plaintiffs' motion to amend their first amended complaint during the pendency of 
Burns' motion, the court will address this motion as against plaintiffs' second amended 
complaint (see 49 W. 12 Tenants Corp. v Seidenberg, 6 AD3d 243, 243, 774 NYS2d 339 
[1st Dept 2004];Livadiotakis v. Tzitzikalakis, ["29O] 302 AD2d 369, 370, 753 NYS2d 898 
[2d Dept 2003]; Sage Realty Corp. v Proskauer Rose, 251 AD2d 35, 38, 675 NYS2d 14 
[1st Dept 1998]). 
Discussion 
In support of his instant motion, Bums argues that this action must be dismissed based 
upon plaintiffs' lack of standing to sue. [FIN2] CPLR 3211 (a) (3) provides for dismissal of
