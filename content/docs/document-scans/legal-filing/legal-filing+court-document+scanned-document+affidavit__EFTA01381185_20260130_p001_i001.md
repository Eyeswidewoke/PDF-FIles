vi. in the event that we are not able to readily obtain equivalent financial instruments 
to deliver to you at the time required: you may be unable to fulfil your settlement 
obligations under a hedging or other transaction you have entered into in relation 
to those financial instruments; a counterparty, exchange or other person may 
exercise a right to buy-in the relevant financial instruments; and you may be 
unable to exercise rights or take other action in relation to those financial 
instruments; 
vii. subject to any express agreement between you and us, we will have no obligation 
to inform you of any corporate events or actions in relation to those financial 
instruments; 
viii. you will not be entitled to receive any dividends, coupon or other payments, 
interests or rights (including securities or property accruing or offered at any time) 
payable in relation to those financial instruments, although the express written 
terms of the relevant Collateral Arrangement or Transaction may provide for you to 
receive or be credited with a payment by reference to such dividend, coupon or 
other payment (a "manufactured payment"); 
ix. the provision of title transfer collateral to us, our exercise of a right of use in 
respect of any financial collateral provided to us by you and the delivery by us to 
you of equivalent financial instruments may give rise to tax consequences that 
differ from the tax consequences that would have otherwise applied in relation to 
the holding by you or by us for your account of those financial instruments; 
x. where you receive or are credited with a manufactured payment, your tax 
treatment may differ from your tax treatment in respect of the original dividend, 
coupon or other payment in relation to those financial instruments. 
b. Where we provide you with clearing services (whether directly as a clearing member or 
otherwise), we draw your attention to the following additional Re-use Risks and 
Consequences: 
i. if we are declared to be in default by an EU central counterparty ("EU CCP") the 
EU CCP will try to transfer ("port") your transactions and assets to another 
clearing broker or, if this cannot be achieved, the EU CCP will terminate your 
transactions; 
ii. in the event that other parties in the clearing structure default (e.g., a central 
counterparty, a custodian, settlement agent or any clearing broker that we may 
instruct) you may not receive all of your assets back and your rights may differ 
depending on the law of the country in which the party is incorporated (which may 
not necessarily be English law) and the specific protections that that party has put 
in place; 
iii. in some cases a central counterparty may benefit from legislation which protects 
actions it may take under its default rules in relation to a defaulting clearing 
member (e.g., to port transactions and related assets) from being challenged 
under relevant insolvency law.
