Synopsis 
Provide a one-paragraph synopsis of 150 words or less describing the matter/work for which the individual or group is being nominated. 
The synopsis should be suitable for use in the awards ceremony program. 
The team members are recognized for their extraordinary work in the multi-year investigation and prosecution of 
Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, the perpetrators of expansive schemes to commit sex trafficking, enticement, 
and transportation offenses against more than one hundred minor girls. Epstein and Maxwell committed these crimes 
over many years, between 1994 and 2004, during which they exploited their vast wealth and elevated social status to 
evade accountability. The team used novel applications of the sex trafficking and enticement statutes, successfully 
litigated complex legal issues, collected and reviewed millions of pages of documentary evidence, and earned the trust 
and cooperation of dozens of traumatized victims to hold Maxwell and Epstein accountable. Following a month-long 
trial, Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 of counts relating to enticement, transportation, sex trafficking, and 
related conspiracy offenses. Epstein was charged with sex trafficking and conspiracy in July 2019; he died by suicide 
before trial.

was convicted in December 2021 of conspiracy to entice minors to travel with intent to engage in sexual activity; 
conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in sexual activity; conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors; 
and substantive counts of transportation and sex trafficking. In June 2022, she was sentenced to [XXX] months of 
incarceration. Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy; he 
died by suicide prior to trial.

, 
and 
in close collaboration with Special Agent _FBI 
Analysts 
and FBI TFO / NYPD 
all members of the FBI Violent Crimes Against Children and Human Trafficking Task Force — and SONY Victim 
Coordinator 
The investigation began after a media report described controversy resulting from a state plea 
agreement for Epstein following previous investigations. Through painstaking efforts to speak with victims 
throughout the country and abroad, including dozens of victims not previously identified, the investigative team 
uncovered a sex abuse and trafficking scheme vastly beyond what previously had been known. 
The scheme began in the 1990s, when Epstein and Maxwell targeted and sexually abused vulnerable girls, in some 
instances in the context of years-long coercive relationships. Maxwell and Epstein cultivated their victims carefully,
