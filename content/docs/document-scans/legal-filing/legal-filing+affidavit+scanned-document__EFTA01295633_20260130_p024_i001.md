785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
(4th Cir. 2004) ('We review de novo . . . whether a post-mandate judgment of a district 
court contravenes the mandate rule, or whether the mandate has been 'scrupulously and 
fully carried out."' (quoting 2A Fed. Proc., L. Ed. § 3:1016)). 
Determining the appropriate standard of review thus requires a two step approach. First, 
we examine de novo whether the district court's decertification order violated our mandate 
in Brown Ito certify the workers' class. Second, if no such violation occurred, we must 
determine anew whether the district court abused its discretion in decertifying the 
promotions class. 
[HN2] As to the first question, an "extraordinary" exception to the mandate rule exists 
when there is "a show[ing] that controlling legal authority has changed dramatically." Bell, 
5 F.3d at 67 (alteration in original). Moreover, Rule 23(c)(1)(C) provides a district court with 
broad discretion to alter or amend a prior class certification decision at any time before 
final judgment. 
Against that backdrop, the parties disagree about whether Wal-Mart provided sufficient 
justification for the district court to invoke rig its powers to revisit certification. Nucor 
maintains that Wal-Mart represents a "sea change" and that "class actions may proceed 
only in the most exceptional of cases." Resp'ts' Br. 15, 20. The workers suggest, however, 
that the Supreme Court instead largely reaffirmed existing precedent. Appellants' Br. 34. 
The truth has settled somewhere in between. See Scott v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 733 
F.3d 105, 113-14 (4th Cir. 2013) (discussing limitations on the scope of Wal-Mart's 
holding); McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 672 F.3d 482, 487-88 
(7th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 338, 184 L. Ed. 2d 157 (2012) (finding that Wal-
Mart provided the basis for a renewed class certification motion); DL v. District of 
Columbia, 713 F.3d 120, 126, 404 U.S. App. D.C. 316 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (surveying how 
Wal-Mart has changed the class action landscape); Elizabeth Tippett, Robbing A Barren 
Vault: The Implications of Dukes v. Wal-Mart for Cases Challenging Subjective 
Employment Practices, 29 Hofstra Lab. & Emp. L.J. 433 (2012) (using an empirical 
analysis to predict Wal-Mart's likely impact on class certifications in the future). [HN3] At 
the very least, Wal-Mart recalibrated and sharpened the lens through which a court 
examines class certification decisions under Rule 23(a)(2), an impact plainly manifested by 
the number of certifications overturned in its wake. See, e.g., EQT Prod. Co. v. Adair, 764 
F.3d 347 (4th Cir. 2014); Rodriguez v. Nat'l City Bank, 726 F.3d 372, 376 (3d Cir. 2013); 
M.D. ex rel. Stukenberg v. Perry, 675 F.3d 832, 839, 841-44 (5th Cir. 2012); Ellis v. Costco 
Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir. 2011). 
In that light, we find that the district court's decision to reconsider the certification of the 
workers' class did not itself violate [".12] our mandate in Brown I. Per this Court's original 
remand instructions, the district court certified both the promotions ['9O2] and hostile 
work environment classes. Although the court had no discretion to then reconsider 
questions decided by this Court under then-existing facts and law, Wal-Mart provided a 
sufficiently significant change in the governing legal standard to permit a limited 
reexamination of whether the class satisfied the commonality requirement of Rule 
23(a)(2).3 There are, however, instances described below when the district court 
unnecessarily revisited other discrete determinations made by this Court in Brown I, such 
as whether the Nucor plant should be treated analytically as a single entity, and whether
