The Whitesides Lab 
The main purpose of our research lab is to produce ideas that change the way people think about science. 
— Professor George Whitesides 
Early in his tenure as President of Harvard University, Dr. Lawrence Summers signaled his view 
that science should play a bigger role in the mission of the University and across society. Harvard's 
rich tradition and scientific excellence within its Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), Medical School, 
and associated teaching hospitals offered a model for success. However, tradition, size, and 
organizational complexity created barriers to the development of new models (or advancing science 
and translating it to benefit society. With recently acquired space in the Allston area of Boston and 
new access to substantial financial resources, the university had the opportunity to influence the way 
academic science and its commercialization would be done in the future. 
In the fall of 2003, President Summers convened a task force on science and technology to identify 
needs and opportunities in scientific research at Harvard. Such an assessment would ensure that in a 
rapidly changing world, Harvard would continue to engage in the most promising areas of science 
and engineering. It also would provide advice on the allocation of resources—physical and 
financial—and how to organize scientific activities geographically, given the new opportunities in 
Allston. The potential was extraordinary because the area was underdeveloped and unprogrammed. 
The task force recommended that a group of initiatives be clustered in Allston within two complexes 
of approximately 500,000 square feet each. All the initiatives, which were seen to exemplify the kind 
of interdisciplinary activity that new ways to collaborate would benefit, could be divided into two 
groups of initiatives. The first included chemical biology, innovative computing, stem cells, and 
systems biology; the second included global neglected diseases, microbial sciences, and the origins of 
life. All these potential activities involved faculty and research staff in the fields of science, 
engineering, and medicine. 
The organization and structure of any one initiative was not yet dear. The research problems of 
each initiative were multidimensional and required many disciplines and investigators currently 
scattered in labs on the Harvard campus in Cambridge and medical facilities and hospitals in Boston. 
By the summer of 2005, many questions still faced Summers and those chosen to lead these new 
scientific enterprises. For example, what characterized truly creative labs? How could research 
collaboration across disciplines best be conducted? How should the impact of academic research labs 
be measured? Could traditional models of highly successful academic labs be scaled up to large, 
mission-oriented centers? 
To understand these issues, the Task Force reflected on the experience of particularly successful 
labs, such as that of Professor George Whitesides of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Whitesides 
Professor H. Kent Bowen and Lecturer/Postdoctoral Fellow Francesca Gino prepared this case. The authors are grateful to James Weber and
