notify DB promptly if it considers that it 
is unable to do so. 
18. 
INFORMATION 
BARRIERS 
AND 
INDEPENDENCE 
18.1 
DB will not, in the course of providing 
services to Client, be obligated to make 
use of or disclose to Client (or where 
applicable, its principal or principals) 
information, whether or not unpublished 
and/or price sensitive, which is in the 
possession of any DB Entity, in 
circumstances where the DB Entity or the 
particular DB personnel who are at that 
time handling Client's (or 
where 
applicable, its principal's or principals') 
affairs are prevented from knowing or 
taking account of such information by 
reason of DB's information bathers or 
independence policies or Applicable 
Law. DB has an information control 
policy that states that information will 
only be shared between DB Entities and 
DB personnel on a need to know basis 
and only to the extent permitted by 
Applicable Law and that information 
from 
a 
particular 
client 
remains 
confidential to that client. 
18.2 
Although personnel of different DB 
Entities may work closely together. strict 
segregation of information is observed 
between personnel engaged in (i) 
research; (ii) sales and trading; (iii) asset 
management; (iv) corporate finance 
advisory; and (v) other banking activities; 
regardless of the DB Entity for which 
they might carry on their duties. 
18.3 
DB personnel will provide Client with 
services on the basis of the information 
known to the particular personnel who 
are at that time handling Client's (or 
where applicable, its principal's or 
principals') affairs. 
19. 
RESEARCH AND OTHER DATA 
19.1 
DB 
may 
publish 
research 
or 
recommendations from time to time to all 
or any of its clients but will be under no 
obligation to disclose or take account of 
such research or recommendations when 
dealing with or for Client. 
19.2 
The terms covering any provision of 
research to Client will be provided to 
Client separately. 
19.3 
DB will be under no obligation to update, 
modify or amend research or to otherwise 
notify Client or any other recipient in the 
event that any matter stated therein, or 
any opinion, projection. forecast or 
estimate set forth therein, changes or 
subsequently becomes inaccurate, except 
if research on the subject company is 
withdrawn. 
19.4 
Material provided to Client (or where 
applicable, its principal or principals) by 
a sales or trading function within DB that 
is not labelled or described as investment 
research will not be produced, reviewed 
or edited by the DB research department. 
Any opinions expressed in such material 
may differ from the opinions expressed 
by other DB departments including the 
DB research department. Sales and 
trading functions may have interests, 
relationships or arrangements which the 
research department does not face. The 
DB Group may engage in transactions in 
a manner inconsistent with the views 
discussed in such material. 
19.5 
Subject to the terms of any written 
agreement between Client and the 
relevant DB Entity material which is 
made available by any DB Entity to 
Client 
including 
research, 
recommendations, pricing information 
and market data (and all intellectual 
property and other rights in the same) 
will, as between Client and the relevant 
DB Entity, remain the exclusive property 
of the relevant DB Entity and will be used
