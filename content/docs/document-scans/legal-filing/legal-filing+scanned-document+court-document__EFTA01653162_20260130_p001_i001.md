United States Attorney's Office (USAO) Reject Log 
When USAO enters a case into CaseView and it does not properly link to an FBI case in Victim Notification System (VNS), the 
case appears on the USAO Reject Log. This log is an automated system and the only way to remove cases from it is by 
addressing the issue that is preventing cases from linking in VNS. 
Causes and Corrective Action for Reject Log 
• Invalid Case Number or Filler FBI Case Number (i.e. XXX or AAA) 
• Confirm the defendant name(s) associated with the USAO case, find the the correct FBI case number in Sentinel, and 
provide to USAO. 
• Case in VNS But Still on USAO Reject Log 
Often the USAO CaseView has incorrect case numbers (usually missing a number) . If the correct case number is in VNS and 
it is incorrect on the reject log, inform USAO to update the case number in CaseView. 
If USAO has the correct case number and you can see the case in VNS but the case remains on the reject log, USAO may 
need to contact VNS helpdesk or USAO VNS Program Manager for technical support. 
CORRECT CASE NUMBER AND DEFENDANT INFORMATION 
• If Not a Victim Case 
• Contact USAO counterpart and ask them to uncheck the victim box in CaseView. 
If a Victim Case 
• Check Sentinel to see if victims were indexed and have been exported to VNS. If not exported, check with Case Agent, then 
export to VNS. 
If Victim Was Exported from Sentinel But NOT in VNS 
There was an issue with the victim information that was exported, causing VNS to reject the uploaded information. The 
victim can't be exported again in Sentinel. Request a shell by emailing HQ DIV42 VNS then the requester or Victim 
Notification Analyst (VNA) can manually enter the victim. 
If a 305 Case or National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) Case 
• Forensic review and NCMEC reviews can take several months. Once CPVA receives a CIR, CPVA will generate a VIR and a 
VNA will enter the case into VNS. 
If you have a CIR already the case needs to be added to VNS, and you need to send a copy of the VIR to the USAO 
(so they can pull VISs). 
• If you have not received a CIR yet wait for CIR/VIR email from CPVA. 
• If it has been a while since the Technical Assistance (TA) request was submitted to NCMEC check with agent to see 
if they received a CIR and no victims were identified. 
If a trial or sentencing date has been set, check with your Case Agent to insure they notified NCMEC of the dates. 
If a Victim Case with Restricted Serial (s) or Restricted Cases (entire case does not need to be restricted, only one serial) 
• Send an email to HQ DIV42 VNS  with case agent approval and shell request. Once shell is in VNS enter the victims manually 
If a Victim Case but it is a Secret Case 
• We NEVER enter Secret cases into VNS. 
• Contact USAO and have them mark the case as "other" agency (not FBI), in CaseView. Once this is done, the USAO may 
enter a case number which does not include our FBI case # in CaseView and it will populate in VNS where USAO can enter 
victims.
