introducing a unique developmental model has gained remarkable international recognition. As you know, 
success implies a certain burden that cannot be avoided. The international focus on Dubai is absolutely normal. 
During crises, people usually turn their attention to those who have proven a successful track record. The current 
crisis has brought Dubai's developmental model with all its successes into a tough test. Some have speculated that 
Dubai will fail this test, simply because they do not know the UAE nor what Dubai has achieved based on solid 
foundation of knowledge, expertise and business ties across the globe. Dubai's achievements are part of the 
UAE's remarkable progress. I know that some people from outside the region have wished that Dubai model will 
go down the river. I am fully aware that some financial and economic circles were not happy with the progress we 
managed to achieve on various tracks including investment, aviation industry, IT and global competition in mana 
ging and financial markets. 
The UAE has proven remarkable competency in addressing difficult questions imposed by the global financial 
crisis. I strongly believe it won't be long before international focus will shift from what is claimed to be Dubai's 
shortcomings to Dubai's and the UAE's overall success in passing this difficult test.

Almost a year ago, and during your visit to Asia, you warned against the global financial 
crisis. Why precautionary measures have not been undertaken to avoid negative impacts of 
this crisis on both Dubai and UAE? 
The crisis have taken the whole world by surprise and evolved in tremendous pace. During my visit to Asia, I had 
warned against turmoil in financial and commodities markets, marginalizing the role of international financial 
institutions and potentials that these institutions fall short from fulfilling their expected roles in a world where all 
international markets became very much related, fuming into one huge global market which does not follow any 
international rules, regulations or supervision. 
I had urged leading world economies to move swiftly and reconsider roles and mechanisms of international 
financial establishments and institutions, especially the International Monetary Fund — and that what exactly the 
G20 summit did last month earlier this month. 
Regarding the precautionary measures, I believe that no preventive measures neither i n the UAE or any other 
country in the world, would have provided the desired immunity from the ramifications of the global financial 
meltdown. The UAE's solid economic structure, efficient performing establishments, adoption of a balanced 
model of conservative banking policies overseen by the Federal Central Bank and liberal economic approach, 
were the key elements that enhanced the country's ability to survive the negative implications of the global crisis 
and prevented any case of bankruptcy in any of the country's banks or major corporations. The impact of the 
crisis on our economy was significant during the last quarter of 2008, yet it was not as harsh as on other major 
economies.

Despite Dubai government officials repeated rebuffs of bailing out some companies to Abu 
Dhabi, speculations in that regard have never stopped. Isn't normal for the Emirates to 
cooperate among themselves to overcome such difficult times? 
Cooperation among the seven Emirates has never stopped and they don't wait for crises to show this cooperation. 
There are several joint ventures between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Founders and stakeholders of most of the UAE 
Public Joint Stock companies are from Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi investors have huge investments in
