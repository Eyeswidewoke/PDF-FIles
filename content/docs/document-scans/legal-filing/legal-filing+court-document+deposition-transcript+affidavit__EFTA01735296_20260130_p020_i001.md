Here is it necessary to focus clearly on the facts of the case. Clear and specific serious allegations have been 
made against Mr Assange in Sweden. Attempts have been made by the Swedish prosecutor as long ago as 
September to interview him. He has not been interviewed. The Swedish system anticipates detention and early 
questioning in allegations of this type, but this has not taken place. Mr Assange is not known to have returned to 
Sweden since September. I have no doubt that this defendant is wanted for prosecution in Sweden. On the 
information before me I cannot say when or what step was taken that can fairly be described as the 
commencement of a prosecution. What I can say is that the boundary• between suspicion and preliminary 
enquiries on the one hand, and prosecution on the other, has been crossed. It may be that after interrogation 
and further enquiries the matter will not be pursued. As Ms Ny says, a formal decision to charge is taken at a 
later stage in Sweden than it is here. In this jurisdiction a person can be charged with rapt or sexual assault by a 
custody sergeant and may then wait many months before the case is discontinued. In Sweden the decision to 
Connally charge is followed very shortly by the trial itself, if the defendant is in custody. 
It is said that the issuance of an EAW was disproportionate. This is not a fret-standing bar to extradition. The 
witnesses' evidence on the availability of other methods for interview, such as mutual assistance, was to some 
extent based on an assumption that other methods had not been vied while Mr Assange was still in Sweden. To 
the extent that the witnesses disagreed with the prosecutor on the facts as they turned out to be, this is a matter 
of legitimate differences of approach. 
In summary: 
1. There is an unequivocal statement that the purpose of the warrant is for prosecution. 
2. I am satisfied, looking at the warrant as a whole, that the requested person is an "accused" 
within section 2(3)(a) of the Extradition Act and is wanted for prosecution under Section 2(3)(b) 
of the Act. 
3. The court must construe the words in the Act in a cosmopolitan sense and not just in terms of 
the stages of English criminal procedure. 
4. As this warrant uses the phrases that are used in the English language version (and indeed the 
Swedish language version) of the EAW annexed to the Framework Decision, there is no (or very 
little) scope for argument on the purpose of the warrant. 
5. In those circumstances the introduction of extrinsic factual and expert evidence should be 
discouraged. 
6. However, having looked at the extrinsic evidence (perhaps wrongly) the fact that some further 
pre-trial evidential investigation could result in no trial taking place does not mean this 
defendant is suspected as opposed to accused. 
7. The information provided by Ms Ny proves strong, if not irrebuttable, evidence that the 
purpose of the warrant is for prosecution. 
8. The evidence provided by the defence does not in any way undermine Ms Ny. 
9. As a matter of fact, looking at all the circumstances in the round, this person passes the 
threshold of being an "accused" person and is wanted for prosecution.
