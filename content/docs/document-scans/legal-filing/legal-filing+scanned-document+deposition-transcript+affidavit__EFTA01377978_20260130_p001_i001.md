The dating Industry Is competitive, with low switching costs and a consistent stream of new products and entrants, and innovation by our 
competitors may disrupt our business. 
The dating industry is competitive, with a consistent stream of new products and entrants. Some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in 
certain geographical regions or user demographics that we currently serve or may serve in the future. These advantages could enable these competitors to 
offer products that are more appealing to users and potential users than our products or to respond more quickly and/or cost-effectively than us to new or 
changing opportunities. 
In addition, within the dating industry generally, costs for consumers to switch between products are low, and consumers have a propensity to try new 
approaches to connecting with people. As a result. new products, entrants and business models are likely to continue to emerge. It is possible that a new 
product could gain rapid scale at the expense of existing brands through hamessing a new technology or distribution channel, creating a new approach to 
connecting people or some other means. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current or future competitors and products that may emerge, the 
size and level of engagement of our user base may decrease. which could have an adverse effect on our business. financial condition and results of 
operations. 
Each of our dating products monetizes users at different rates. If a meaningful migration of our user base from our higher monetizing dating 
products to our lower monetizing dating products were to occur, It could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of 
operations. 
We own, operate and manage a large and diverse portfolio of dating products. Each dating product has its own mix of free and paid features designed to 
optimize the user experience and revenue generation from that product's community of users. In general, the mix of features for the various dating products 
within our more established brands leads to higher monetization rates per user than the mix of features for the various dating products within our newer 
brands. If a significant portion of our user base were to migrate

to our less profitable brands. our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. See "Management's discussion and 
analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Trends affecting our Dating business.' 
Our growth and profitability rely, in part, on our ability to attract and retain users through cost-effective marketing efforts. Any failure in these 
efforts could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Attracting and retaining users for our dating products involve considerable expenditures for online and offline marketing. Historically. we have had to increase 
our marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and retain users and sustain our growth.
Evolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of profitable marketing opportunities. For example, as traditional television viewership declines and as 
consumers spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktop computers, the reach of many of our traditional advertising channels is contracting. 
Simitarty, as consumers communicate less via email and more via text messaging and other virtual means, the reach of email campaigns designed to attract 
new and repeat users (and retain current users) for our dating products is adversely impacted. To continue to reach potential users and grow our businesses, 
we must identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer advertising channels, such as mobile and online video platforms as well as 
targeted campaigns in which we communicate directly with potential, former and current users via new virtual means. Generally, the opportunities in and 
sophistication of newer advertising channels are relatively undeveloped and unproven, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to 
appropriately manage and fine-tune our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry. Any failure to do so could 
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Communicating with our users via email is critical to our success, and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not 
sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
As consumer habits evolve in the era of smart phones and messagingtocial networking apps, usage of email, particularly among our younger users, has 
declined. In addition, deliverability restrictions imposed by third party email providers could limit or prevent our ability to send emails to our users. One of our 
primary means of communicating with our users and keeping them engaged with our products is via email. Our ability to communicate via email enables us to 
keep our users updated on activity with respect to their profile, present or suggest new or interesting users from the community, invite them to offline events 
and present discount and free trial offers. among other things. Any erosion in our ability to communicate successfulty with our users via email could have an 
adverse impact on user experience and the rate at which non-paying users become paid members. 
While we continually work to find new means of communicating and connecting with our members (for example. through push notifications), there is no 
assurance that such alternative means of communication will be as effective as email has been. Any failure to develop or take advantage of new means of 
communication could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our quarterly results or operating metrics could fluctuate significantly, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. 
Our quarterly results and operating metrics have fluctuated historically and we expect that they could continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a 
number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict. including: 
the timing. size and effectiveness of our marketing efforts:
