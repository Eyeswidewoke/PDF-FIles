Jewish residents in the areas harmed by the fire, and primarily Haifa, as tens of thousands 
of residents were evacuated from their homes due to the spread of the fires to many 
neighborhoods in the city... 
Photographer and producer Oren Rosenfeld... joined the teams in an attempt to document 
the cooperation between the Palestinians and Israelis, which was meant to save the city 
from the fire. He is filming a documentary film on the subject. 
He said that at the moment the cause of the outbreak of fires does not matter, nor does 
whether it is intentional or not. He noted that the most important thing is to fight the fire and 
continue to work to put it out in cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian firefighters. 'At 
the moment we are working alongside the Palestinians, there are four Palestinian fire trucks 
here,' and he added: 'We are talking in Hebrew mixed with Arabic, and fighting the fire 
through a common language. Therefore, at this time we are not interested in the cause of 
the outbreak, and we are trying to put it out together!' 
The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in the official Twitter account 'Israel in Arabic': 'Your 
neighbor is your relative. Many thanks to the Egyptians for sending two helicopters, to 
Jordan for the fire trucks for putting out the fires, and to the PA for eight fire trucks.' 
The Israeli Foreign Ministry shared an additional tweet from [Israeli] Police Spokesman 
Micky Rosenfeld, in which he posted pictures of the efforts to put out the fires and said: 'The 
Palestinian firefighters are working together with the Israeli firefighters in Haifa in order to 
assist in putting out the fires.'"

9 - Criticism of Israel for supposedly not publicly expressing thanks and credit to 
Palestinians (PA Foreign Ministry) 
"The Palestinian [PA] Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that despite the historical injustice that 
the Palestinian people has experienced, its modest means, its great suffering because of the 
Israeli occupation and its abominable acts and its [Palestinian] constant need for someone 
to stand by it, aid it, and give it a hand, our people did not hesitate to contribute to the efforts 
to put out the fires in Israel... The statement added: '...senior [Israeli] officials chose to 
respond in a lowly and inappropriate way to the Palestinian participation, in an attempt to 
erase the humanitarian role fulfilled by the State of Palestine before the world.' 
In the statement it was noted that the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a 
statement on its social media pages, in which it thanked the countries that participated in the 
efforts to put out the fires. However, it did not thank the State of Palestine, and did not put its 
flag next to the flags of the participating countries and the countries that offered aid, and just 
made do with a marginal reference at the bottom of the page to 'aid from the PA'... It finished 
by saying: 'The appreciation of the entire world is enough for us, and living in peace with 
ourselves is enough for us. However, the international community needs to be more 
assertive in dealing with the Israeli opportunism, which jumps on the Palestinian land and 
threatens to increase the illegal settlement in response to a natural disaster."

Note: The Facebook post the PA was complaining about thanked countries for sending airplanes 
and added at the bottom: "Ground assistance received also from the Palestinian Authority." As 
shown in the previous article, the Israeli government went out of its way to publicly express
