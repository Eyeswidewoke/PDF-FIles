The Cognitive Interview method of conducting police interviews: 
Eliciting extensive information and promoting Therapeutic Jurisprudence. 
When a crime occurs, police take as their primary goals solving the crime and apprehending the 
criminal. Police try to elicit as much information as possible from victims and witnesses, as their 
testimony is considered to be the best predictor of solving crimes (Berresheim & Weber, 2003; 
George & Clifford, 1992; Kebbell & Milne, 1998; Kebbell & Wagstaff, 1997). Often 
overlooked, however, is the plight of the victim, who may suffer psychologically from having 
been victimized. Might the police, in a properly conducted investigation, also be able to assist 
the victim, in line with the tenets of Therapeutic Jurisprudence (Wexler & Winick, 1996)? We 
focus here on the role of the police interview to accomplish these two goals: eliciting witness 
information to solve crimes, and promoting victims' psychological health. Specifically, we 
examine a particular interviewing protocol, the Cognitive Interview (CI), as a method to 
accomplish these goals. 
Ideally, witnesses and victims would observe the crime under optimal viewing conditions, 
possess good memories and verbal abilities, and be psychologically healthy after the crime. 
Unfortunately, these ideals often do not materialize as victims sometimes observe the crime 
under suboptimal viewing conditions, have poor memories and verbal skills, and are traumatized 
by their experiences,. Police have no control over these factors, however, and so they seem more 
like wishful thinking than effective police work. About the only factor that police can control is 
how they interview victims and witnesses. Our working hypothesis, and the focus of this article, 
is that the most realistic way to elicit high-quality witness information and facilitate victims' 
health will come about by conducting effective interviews. 
What kind of training do police receive to interview witness and victims and how do they 
actually conduct these interviews? We were discouraged to find that police often receive only 
minimal, and sometimes no, formal training to interview cooperative witnesses, and, not 
surprisingly, their actual interview practices are quite poor (see Fisher & Schreiber, 2007, for a 
review). Throughout much of the world, police training focuses on the many facets of police 
work other than interviewing cooperative witnesses, e.g., learning the law, writing reports, 
testifying in court, driving safely, using firearms, controlling crowds, protecting evidence, etc. 
To the degree that police do receive training on interviewing, it seems to be more on 
interrogating suspects (to elicit confessions) rather than on interviewing cooperative witnesses 
and victims. Although training in interviewing cooperative witnesses is better in some parts of 
the world (e.g., UK, Sweden, Australia), for the most part, it is seen as a secondary, or more 
likely, tertiary, skill for effective police work (see e.g., Allison, Sarangi, & Wright, in press, 
analysis of interviewing in India). 
The lack of formal training in interviewing cooperative witnesses and victims allows police 
investigators to conduct interviews based on their intuitions. In that sense, police interviewers are 
similar to other investigative interviewers who are also poorly trained, including accident 
investigator, attorneys, physicians, fire marshals, safety inspectors, etc. The prototypical 
interviews in all of these domains follow the same style of asking specific questions directed 
toward each fact that the interviewer needs to learn. The only difference across domains is in
