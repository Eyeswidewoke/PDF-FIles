Yes, this may confl=ct with your desire to forge your own legacy. But presidents can't be ever=where and do everything. 
Smart and empowered secretaries of state can set =p all kinds of opportunities through the tireless and tedious 
diplomacy that you may not have the time to join.=Baker worked for nine months to set up the Madrid peace 
conference for Bus= 41. Madeleine Albright labored for a year and a half to set up the Wye Ri=er Summit and prevented 
a great deal of Israeli-Palestinian violence in the process. Give your secretary o= state a few big issues -- he or she can 
actually make you look good, and =erve American national interests too. 
4. Come clean on=Benghazi 
You have a real cre=ibility problem on this one from almost every conceivable angle. You've pr=ded yourself on 
competence in foreign policy, and yet the fatal attack on =he diplomatic mission in eastern Libya raises serious questions 
about your administration's judgment and performa=ce. 
Over the past two m=nths, the questions have piled up higher and higher: Why weren't adequate =reparations taken 
months before the attack to deal with what was clearly a=higher threat level to Western and U.S. interests in Libya? 
What was the CIA's role in responding to the cris=s, and the Pentagon's too? And what about the confused and 
misleading mess=ges that came from your administration as you responded to the crisis? 
Neither a congressi=nal nor a State Department investigation will be credible enough to answer=these questions. Some 
independent panel should be created -- one with the =andate to go after the White House, too -- to determine what 
transpired. In a turbulent Middle East, the threa=s to America's diplomats will continue. We need to figure out a better 
way=to minimize the risks. 
5. The Middle Ea=t is a choice between root canals or migraines. Pick your poison. 
No region of the wo=ld is going to be more dangerous for the United States than the Middle Eas=. Challenges abound --
but at the moment there don't appear to be a great =any opportunities. Disengagement, sadly, is not an option. 
Again, think transa=tion, not transformation. On Iran, explore the hell out of diplomacy befor= you seriously consider 
military action -- let alone war. Getting out of t=ese conflicts is always more difficult than it seems, and the risk-to-
reward ratio on Iran is inherently skewed t=ward the risk end. Once a nation acquires the knowledge and capacity to 
co=struct a nuclear weapon, it can't just be bombed out of its collective con=ciousness. Military actions will at best 
delay, not prevent, Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. <1=> 
Unless you can chan=e the mullahcracy in Tehran, your best bet would be an outcome that would =eep Iran years away 
from actually making a nuclear weapon. Given the depth=of animosity and mistrust between the United States and Iran 
over the last half-century, the odds of a grand bar=ain are pretty low. 
But here's how to g=ve it your best shot: Start with an interim arrangement that deals with th= issue of enrichment, and 
forestalls Iran from acquiring enough highly enr=ched uranium to construct a nuke. To get such a deal, by the way, you 
can't just come to the party with sticks.=Carrots will be required too -- not only some sanctions relief on the enri=hment 
question, but developing Iran's enrichment capacity on the civilian =ide. None of this may work -- but a good-faith, 
sustained effort is critical to your credibility and to any =allow-on military attack. 
On Israeli-Palestin=an peace, think interim agreements and managing the conflict. Barring some=profound change in the 
politics of Israel or Palestine, no conflict-ending=solution that addresses borders, Jerusalem, refugees and security is 
likely. 
Also, prepare to de=l with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for some time to come. If you're =ooking to get even 
with him for stiffing you on settlements, sit quietly u=til the urge passes. Israeli elections in January will likely return Bibi
