GLOUS238 SOUTHERN FINANCIAL LLC 
iCapital Advisors, LLC 
Form ADV Part 2A 
investment. Certain management persons of iCapital (or its affiliates) are also involved with 
soliciting investment advisers to participate in iCapital offered funds and in performing diligence 
on such investment advisers with which to launch access vehicles. Such relationship may 
create potential conflicts of interest. iCapital addresses these conflicts by providing in its Code 
of Ethics that all supervised persons have a duty to act in the best interests of each investor 
and by providing training to supervised persons with respect to conflicts of interest and how 
such conflicts are resolved under the iCapital's policies and procedures. 
Furthermore. 
compensation for management persons is not based on any transaction-based compensation 
received by iCapital Securities (or its affiliates). 
Fees Paid by Brokerage Limited Partners. Limited partners in one or more of the Funds may elect 
to be treated as "brokerage limited partners" and in connection therewith, pay a larger 
management fee than limited partners that are not "brokerage limited partners" for reporting, 
administrative and other services provided by such brokerage limited partner's registered 
investment adviser or adviser representative. The amount of any such additional management 
fee will generally be allocated to third parties or affiliates that provide investor-related 
services, including such brokerage limited partner's adviser representative. The existence of 
such fee may incentivize an investor's registered investment adviser or adviser representative 
to recommend a Fund over other investments from which such registered investment adviser 
or adviser representative would not receive such fee. 
Estimates. The governing documents of each Fund provide that values of the Fund's assets shall 
generally be calculated by the Fund's administrator based on estimates provided by the 
applicable Underlying Fund Manager or Sub-Adviser. The Underlying Fund Manager or Sub-
Adviser will have a conflict of interest in determining such valuations if the applicable Fund 
charges its fees based on the value of the Fund's investments, including any performance-based 
compensation charged by such Fund. The general partner (or its affiliates, as applicable) of each 
Fund may also benefit from any overvaluation of an Underlying Fund's investments if the 
management fee for those Funds is based on the net asset value of a Fund's investment in the 
Underlying Fund. 
Educational Programs. iCapital may, from time to time, offer (and. under certain circumstances, 
subsidize) certain educational and professional certification programs for financial advisers that 
recommend products included on the Institutional Capital Network platform. The provision of 
such programs may create a conflict of interest because the offering of such programs may 
incentivize the advisers that participate in such programming to recommend iCapital and interests 
in iCapital Private Access Funds over a manager or administrative agent who has not provided such 
educational opportunities. A prospective investor should carefully consider such conflict when 
determining whether to subscribe for Interests.

personal information. It is iCapital's policy to collect only information necessary or relevant to 
our management business and use only legitimate means to collect such information. iCapital 
does not disclose any non-public, personal information about our Investors to anyone except 
as needed for servicing and processing transactions, as consented to by an investor and 
required by law. iCapital restricts access to non-public, personal information about our 
Investors to those employees with a legitimate business need for the information. iCapital
