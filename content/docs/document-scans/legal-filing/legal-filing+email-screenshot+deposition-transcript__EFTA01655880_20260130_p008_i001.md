Vermont State Police, FBI Investigate Damage to FAA Station 
WPTZ (NBC-5) (08/15, Cusanelli) reported that Vermont State Police and the FBI are investigating after a Federal 
Aviation Administration facility in Washington, Vermont, was seemingly vandalized back in June. According to the 
article, in July, FAA officials in Burlington reported a vandalism incident at the Very High Frequency Omnidirectional 
Range, or VOR, station in Washington on Cyr Heights Road, after inspectors noticed damage at the station on July 2. 
Officials later confirmed that service at the station had been disrupted several days before, on June 30. The article 
stated that the damage included monitor antennas that had been removed from the station, panels smashed on 
the HVAC unit, a door handle torn off a second-story structure access door, and antennas inside the structure being 
bent out of shape. The article added that the facility is an automated monitoring station that aids in navigation for 
the nearby EF Knapp State Airport in Berlin. While the station is primarily used as a backup emergency navigation 
station for pilots in the area, it is used to assist commercial pilots with navigation information particularly during 
periods of bad weather, according to the FAA. 
Prominent California Lawyer Abused Pandemic Loan Program, Prosecutors Say 
Reuters (08/15, Thomas) reported that prominent California attorney Lisa Bloom and her law firm will pay more 
than $274,000 to resolve claims that they gave the U.S. government false information in connection with a COVID-
19 pandemic relief program, federal prosecutors said Thursday. The Bloom Firm will pay approximately $204,000 
while Bloom and her husband Braden Pollock will each pay more than $35,000 to settle allegations under the False 
Claims Act, prosecutors said. The article stated that Bloom, Pollock and the law firm denied the allegations, and are 
not admitting any liability by settling the claims, according to documents prosecutors provided. Bloom is known for 
taking on high-profile cases, including representing women who accused now-deceased financier Jeffrey 
Epstein and comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault. Her past clients have also included disgraced Hollywood 
producer Harvey Weinstein. The article mentioned that prosecutors alleged that the Bloom Firm falsely certified it 
used funds from the U.S. Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program during the pandemic for 
eligible payroll expenses, when it actually used the money to pay several workers who were ineligible to receive the 
PPP funds or were not working for the firm. Fox News (08/15, Price) also reported on the story. 
Former Alabama Police Officer Agrees to Plead Guilty in Alleged Drug Planting Scheme 
The Associated Press (08/15, Staff Writer) reported that a former Alabama police officer has agreed to plead guilty 
in connection with an alleged scheme to plant drugs on motorists, federal prosecutors announced Thursday. The 
article stated that court records show that Michael Kilgore, a former police officer with the Centre Police 
Department, has signed a plea agreement on a charge of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. It 
describes how a package containing methamphetamines, oxycodone and marijuana was planted in a woman's car 
with the help of a co-conspirator. According to the plea agreement, the scheme began in early 2023 when Kilgore 
found methamphetamines and marijuana in a car and offered to let the driver avoid drug charges by working with 
him as a confidential informant. The article mentioned that Kilgore told the co-conspirator that he wanted to make 
a narcotics case and the two arranged for a package of drugs to be attached to the undercarriage of a vehicle, 
according to the plea agreement. On Jan. 31, 2023, Kilgore pulled the car over during for an alleged traffic violation 
and searched it and produced the drugs, prosecutors said. Kilgore and his co-conspirator had planned a second 
drug plant, prosecutors added, but the co-conspirator discarded the drugs and reported the scheme to law 
enforcement. A DOJ press release noted that the FBI investigated the case. 
Federal Authorities File Additional Charges Against Chinese-Linked Biolab in Central California 
Fox News (08/15, Price) reported that federal authorities announced new charges against the operators of an illegal 
underground biolab found in a Central California community last fall. Jia Bei Zhu, 62, a citizen of China, was 
previously indicted for distributing bogus and misbranded COVID-19 test kits in violation of the federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act. He was also charged with making false statements to authorities about his identity and 
involvement with the biolabs. Additional charges have now been filed against Zhaoyan Wang, 38, also a citizen of 
China, who officials described as a "romantic and business partner." The article stated that according to court 
documents, from August 2020 through March 2023, Zhu and Wang conspired to defraud buyers of UMI and PBI's 
COVID-19 test kits. They imported hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 test kits from Ai De Ltd., which was a 
company in China that they controlled, and falsely represented to the buyers that the test kits were made in the 
United States. A DOJ press release noted that this case is the product of an investigation by the FBI and the FDA 
Office of Criminal Investigations.
