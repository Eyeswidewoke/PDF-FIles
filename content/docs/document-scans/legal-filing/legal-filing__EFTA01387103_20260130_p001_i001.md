Where we have conviction, and where 
we don't 
On the back of 4Q results we have increased conviction in our positive stance 
on Knight Transportation (KNX), XPO Logistics (XPO) and CSX Corp (CSX). 
We remain comfortable with our sole-Sell ratings on Old Dominion (ODFL) and 
Canadian National (CNI), while our Buy on UPS was wrong and we are using 
this report to downgrade our rating to Hold and lower our price target to $115. 
Our company-specific thoughts are below, and see details within this note for our 
industry takeaways post results: 
• KNX - best earnings revision potential across our coverage universe: 
For KNX we see potential for EPS to approach $3.60 per share in 2019, 
which is 30% above current consensus. This is based on 15% operating 
margin on 2019e revenue ex. fuel, which is 200bps better than what 
KNX-SWFT achieved on a consolidated basis in 4O'17- despite being in 
the early innings of integration and cyclical recovery. Our bullishness is 
supported by highly accommodative cyclical and non-cyclical factors, 
such as high-single-digit growth in U.S. truck tonnage and contract 
rates, double-digit improvements in yield, and plenty of low-hanging cost 
opportunity at Swift. See Figure 1 within this note for our walk to mid-
teens operating margin. 
• XPO- we see potential for very strong 2019 free cash flow: Our long-held 
positive stance on XPO has been predicted on accelerating revenue and 
free cash flow growth. Indeed, organic growth accelerated to +10.4% in 
4O, and free cash flow has tripled in two years- from $211M in 2016 to 
expected $625M this year. In the context of this free cash trajectory, an 
exact tripling of equity value in a little over a year is highly explainable, 
if not conservative, as it implies little in the way of multiple expansion 
(i.e. equity value has increased almost exactly in-line with free cash flow). 
Our 2019 free cash forecast of $750M implies 20% yoy growth, with 
upside to 35% growth (to $835M) if current organic growth rates are 
sustainable- which we think is a realistic outcome given macro backdrop, 
e-commerce exposure, and the company's growth investments. From this 
standpoint we see a relatively quick trajectory to our $133 price target, 
which represents 40% add'l upside. See Figure 2 within this note for our 
2019 FCF walk for XPO. 
• UPS - Downgrading to Hold (lowering PT to $115): Following 4O capex 
guidance- which was worse than even the most bearish expectations-
