I remembered that when we'd once discussed math =94in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn =80 t 
studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the Brit=sh educational system), I received a package at home 
via messenger. It w=s a book: "Math for idiots." 
So he is not w=thout humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates rest=urants. 
"Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subject=," newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was 
=ertainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does k=ow a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in 
his company and you =now this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew wal=ing in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that =9CAndy"—
as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking =or help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange ti=le is. 
Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to interna=ional business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking about far more 
t=an "Andy" does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman an= a few other financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It =80 s almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most inter=sting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I =99ve spent hours talking 
to her about the third world at a bar until 2am= She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has 
s=ent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone=else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish 
there. Her rolodex would blow aw=y almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even Rupe=t Murdochs'. She is very 
well-read and can talk about most thing= for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close =riends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at th= 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, 
(known f=ndly to her close friends as "the Tennis Goddess") Ghisl=ine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to 
things she really =ares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows he= vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her f=iendship with Jeffrey. 
"He saved her," I reme=ber a close friend of mine telling me. "When her father died, sh= was a wreck; inconsolable. And 
then Jeffrey took her in. She's =ever forgotten that—and never will." 
In many =ays, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and =anch was the perfect replacement for 
her father, the late Robert Maxwell= newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos,=but then 
Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After =11, it was he who died leaving a massive "black hole" he=E2 d 
fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may=not have seemed that strange. 
In fact, she probably figured= rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that mos= successful people in 
the end either have some weird habit (the late Bru=e Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved 
countrie= to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart=) You don't tend to get to the top by 
being the world's =ost balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't =uite manage a normal life—
whatever that is. He had a second =80 wife" for many years whose existence he has been open about= 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven=E2 t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her 
loyalty to=friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she=E2 II be out and about as always. Look at 
Waksal and Stewart. No on= sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes=up for all sorts of 
blemishes.
