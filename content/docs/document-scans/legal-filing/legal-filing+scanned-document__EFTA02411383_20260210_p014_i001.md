potential tax yield by 26%. It is normal to do deals under the table. On the birth of his baby daughter one parent 
was asked to hand over C2,500 in cash to the doctor, in exchange for a receipt for C1,500. The Greeks are 
attempting to tackle this issue. The austerity packages introduced over the past 12 months require higher earners 
to provide receipts for expenditure before they can qualify for their tax-free allowance. 
Market discipline did not work in either country. Greece benefited from the implied credit upgrade provided by 
joining the euro zone. Iceland, with its high interest rates, got a boost from the "carry trade", with investors 
borrowing money in low-yielding currencies (eg, the yen) and buying high-yielding ones (eg, the krona). "It was a 
classic case of monetary boom and bust," says Thordur Palsson, a former chief economist at Kaupthing, a big 
Icelandic bank. "The money supply increased at 40% a year over a five-year period." 
Both economies face fundamental difficulties. For Greece, being a member of the euro zone is now a hindrance 
rather than a help. Its costs are too high but it cannot devalue its currency, and trying to inflate its way out of its 
debt would, in effect, be impossible. Iceland, which is not a member of the European Union, has been able to 
devalue the krona, but that created a problem for individuals and companies which had borrowed in foreign 
currencies. Its banks had to be nationalised and domestic depositors were favoured over foreign creditors. 
Both countries have had to call in outside help. The Icelanders have borrowed from the IMF, with their 
negotiations made more complex by a dispute with Britain and the Netherlands over compensation for foreign 
depositors in one of its big banks. Iceland is trying to reduce its fiscal deficit, which in 2008 reached 13.6% of 
GDP, via increases in value-added tax, income tax, and petrol and alcohol duties. Rising unemployment has 
prompted many Icelanders to emigrate, causing the population to fall for the first time since the 19th century. 
In Greece spiralling debt costs also forced the government to turn to the IMF as well as to its EU partners. But it 
remains to be seen whether the population will tolerate the austerity needed to bring the debt burden down to a 
reasonable level. The most recent package of cuts provoked a wave of strikes and riots in which three bank 
employees died. 
America also faces a huge debt problem. The Congressional Budget Office calculates that the federal government 
will accumulate a deficit of $10 trillion between 2011 and 2020, and even that depends on some fairly optimistic 
assumptions about economic growth. Unless policies are changed, total government debt will reach 100% of GDP 
by 2023. There are unfunded liabilities on top of that. Chris Watling of Longview Economics reckons that the net 
present value of spending commitments under the Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security programmes is 276% of 
GDP. The Democrats resist cuts in entitlements and the Republicans resist tax increases, so nothing much gets 
done. Efforts to establish a bipartisan deficit-cutting commission have failed. 
Advantage America 
But America has two huge advantages over other countries that have allowed it to face its debt with relative 
equanimity: possessing both the world's reserve currency and its most liquid asset market, in Treasury bonds. 
Even in the midst of the credit crunch, when some of the biggest Wall Street banks were collapsing, the dollar 
rose and Treasury bond yields fell, making it easier and cheaper for America to finance its deficit. There may come 
a time when America is hit by a funding crisis, but it does not look imminent. 
America would be more at risk if the Asian central banks and sovereign-wealth funds had an obvious alternative. 
But with Europe in the midst of its own debt crisis, the euro does not look like an appealing option. And there is 
simply not enough gold in the world to absorb a substantial portion of central-bank reserves. For the moment, the 
dollar is the one-eyed currency in the land of the blind.
