ACC 
For the Period I/1/101.. 
Important Information about Pricing and Valuations 
Certain assets including but not limited to, pooled private investments, non-publicly traded and infrequently traded securities, derivatives, partnership interests and tangible assets are generally illiquid, 
the value of which may have been provided to us by third parties who may not be independent of the issuer or manager. Such information is reflected as of the last date provided to us. and is not 
independently verified. 
Pnces, some of which are provided by pricing services or other sources which we deem reliable, are not guaranteed for accuracy or as realizable values. 
Market value information (including without limitation. prices. exchange rates, accrued income and bond ratings) furnished herein has been obtained from sources that J.P. Morgan believes to be 
reliable and is furnished for the exclusive use of the client. 
J.P. Morgan makes no representation, warranty or guarantee, express or implied, that any quoted value represents the actual terms at which transactions or securities could be bought or sold or new 
transactions could be entered into, or the actual terms on which existing transactions or securities could be liquidated. 
The current price is the value of the financial asset share, unit or contract as priced at the close of the market on the last day of the statement period or the last available price. 
All values provided for structured yield deposits (for example. JPMorgan London Time Deposits) reflect the original deposit amount only. 
The current value for Real Estate. Mineral Interests and Miscellaneous Assets may not reflect the most current value of the asset. 
Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are indicative values as of the 
close of business of the date of this statement and, except as otherwise agreed in writing, these valuations do not represent the actual terms at which transactions or securities could be bought or sold or 
new transactions could be entered into, or the actual terms on which existing transactions or securities could be liquidated as of the date of this statement. We do not warrant their completeness or 
accuracy. These valuations are derived from proprietary models based upon well-recognized financial principles and we have. when necessary to calculate the present value of future cash flows. made 
reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions. Valuations based on other models or different assumptions may yield different results. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility 
for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. 
Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended solely for your own use. Please refer to the trade confirmation for details of each transaction. 
Please review your statement promptly and report any discrepancies immediately to an account officer whose name appears on the contact page of this statement. 
Important Information Regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily. 
weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In a 
failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements. Accordingly, investors should not rely on pricing 
information appearing in their statements with respect to ARS. 
You should have received separate confirmations for each securities transaction. All transactions are subject to the terms and conditions stated on the reverse side of such confirmations and are subject 
to the constitution, by-laws, customs and interpretations of the marketplace where executed and governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and all applicable 
federal laws and regulations. Further information with respect to commissions and other charges related to the execution of transactions. including options transactions, has been included in 
confirmations that were previously furnished to you. Upon written request, JPMSI will promptly supply you with the latest such information. 
Shareholders of certain JPMorgan Funds are charged a redemption fee equal to 2% of the proceeds If they exchange or redeem shares of such funds within 60 days of purchase, subject to certain 
exceptions set forth in the prospectus of the applicable Fund. Please consult your J.P. Morgan representative for a list of the JPMorgan Funds that impose redemption fees.
