systems and arc subject to changes by them. The Co-Issuers lake no responsibility for these operations and 
procedures and urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters. 
DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, 
the "Participants") and facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants 
through electronic book-entry• changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers 
and dealers (including the Initial Purchaser), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other 
organizations. Access to DTC's system is also available to other entities such as banks. brokers, dealers and trust 
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly 
(collectively, the "Indirect Participants"). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by 
or on behalf of DTC only through Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has no knowledge of the identity of 
beneficial owners of securities held by or on behalf of DTC. DTC's records reflect only the identity of Participants 
to whose accounts securities arc credited. The ownership interests and transfer of ownership interests of each 
beneficial owner of each security held by or on behalf of DTC am recorded on the records of the Participants and 
Indirect Participants. 
Pursuant to procedures established by DTC: 
• 
upon deposit of the Global Securities. DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the Initial 
Purchaser with portions of the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Global Securities: and 
• 
ownership of such interests in the Global Securities will be maintained by DTC (with respect to the 
Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial 
interests in the Global Securities). 
Investors in the Global Securities ntay hold their interests therein directly through DTC, if they arc Participants in 
such system. or indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants or 
Indirect Participants in such system. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Securities on behalf of 
their participants through customers' securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective 
depositaries. which are Euroclear Bank. S.A./N.V.. as operator of Euroclear. and Citibank. N.A.. as operator of 
Clearstream. The depositaries, in turn, will hold interests in the Securities in customers' securities accounts in the 
depositaries' names on the books of DTC. 
All interests in a Global Security, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream. will be subject to the 
procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream will also be subject to 
the procedures and requirements of these systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical 
delivery of certificates evidencing securities they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a 
Global Security to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, 
which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of beneficial owners of interests in a Global Security 
to pledge such interests to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in 
respect of such interests. may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. For certain 
other restrictions on the transferability of the Securities, see "Transfer and Exchange" and "ERISA Considerations." 
Except as described below. owners of interests in the Global Securities will not have Securities registered in 
their names, will not receive physical delivery of Securities in certificated form and will not be considered the 
registered owners or holders thereof under the Indenture for any purpose. 
Payments in respect of a Global Security registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its 
capacity as the registered holder of such Securities. The Co-Issuers and the Trustee will treat the persons in whose 
names the Securities, including the Global Securities, are registered as the owners thereof for the purpose of 
receiving such payments and for any and all other purposes whatsoever. Consequently, none of the Co-Issuers. the 
Trustee or any agent of the Co-Issuers or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for 
• 
any aspect of DTC's records or any Participant's or Indirect Participant's records relating to or payments 
made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Securities, or for maintaining, supervising 
or reviewing any of DTC's records or any Participant's or Indirect Participant's records relating to the 
beneficial ownership interests in the Global Securities; or
