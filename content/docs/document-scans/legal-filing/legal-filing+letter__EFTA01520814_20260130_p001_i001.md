For the Period 9/I/I I to 9/30/II 
Direct private equity investments are generally valued at cost, unless there is an active secondary trading market in the securities, in which case, direct private equity investments are valued using market 
prices as of the close of the last business day for this statement period. Pooled private equity investments are valued according to the General Partners or Managers stated methodology. Please refer 
to the limited partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or other operative documentation for each investment for the specific valuation methodology used by the General Partner or 
Manager for that investment. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the information and the methodology used by the General Partner or Manager in deriving 
valuations. (2) any errors or omissions in compiling or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any use to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for Information purposes only and are 
intended solely for your own use. 
Hedge funds generally calculate the price (the 'Net Asset Value" or" NAV"). 10-15 business days following the Last business day of the month. For that reason, hedge fund NAVs shown will generally be 
the NAV of the month preceding this statement period. In general, the NAV is stated net of management and Incentive fees. The NAV is calculated according to the General Partners or Managers 
stated methodology. Please refer to the limited partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or other operative documentation for each hedge fund for the specific methodology used by 
the General Partner or Manager for that hedge fund. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the information and the methodology used by the General Partner or 
Manager in deriving valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in compiling or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any use to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information 
purposes only and are intended solely for your own use. 
These statements do not provide tax reporting on private investments. Please continue to rely upon the General Partner or Manager of the investment vehicle for this Information. 
2. The 'Capital Called Since Inception USD' and "Cash/Security distributions Since Inception USD' columns are updated monthly to reflect activity (capital calls and distributions), if any. 
3. Hedge funds generally allow subscriptions on a monthly or quarterly basis. Your interest in a hedge fund or hedge fund of funds is generally as of the first business day of the subscription period. Due 
to early funding requirements by the applicable fund, your account may be debited for the subscription amount prior to the subscription date. Please refer to the applicable hedge fund's operative 
documentation for further details. 
Hedge fund redemptions are generally on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis but can sometimes be subject to a multi-year lockup before a redemption is permitted. For redemptions, there is generally 
a notification period that can be a long interval before the actual redemption date. Redemption proceeds are generally paid 15 calendar days after the final NAV is issued, but can be subject to a 
holdback of a portion of the proceeds until an annual audit of the Fund has been completed. Please refer to the applicable hedge fund's operative documentation for further details. 
Global Access Portfolios share certain characteristics with hedge funds. In particular, an investor who withdraws from a Global Access Portfolio will not receive the withdrawal proceeds in their entirety 
until 30-60 days after completion of the Portfolio's audit, which may be 18 months or longer after the redemption date. Interest may not be paid on any proceeds pending distribution. These restrictions 
apply even if the investors account at JPMorgan is closed. The Confidential Private Placement Memorandum and applicable Supplements contain other important information about the Global Access 
Portfolios and are available upon request. 
4. Alternative assets may include publicly available mutual funds that utilize non-traditional investment management strategies, for example, strategies commonly employed by hedge funds. Mutual 
funds generally calculate the price (the "Net Asset Value" or "NAY') on a daily basis and mutual fund NAVs shown on your statement generally will be the NAV as of the close of the last business day for 
this statement period. Please refer to the applicable mutual fund prospectus for further details. If the applicable mutual fund is a JPMorgan Fund, please refer to disclosures on this statement concerning 
JPMorgan Funds for other important information.
