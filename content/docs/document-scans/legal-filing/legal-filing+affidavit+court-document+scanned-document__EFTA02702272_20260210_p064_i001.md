• 
consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the subordinated indenture or such 
corresponding subordinated debt securities, where such consent shall be required; 
without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the holders of a majority in aggregate liquidation amount of 
all outstanding preferred securities. 
However, where a consent under the subordinated indenture would require the consent of each holder of 
corresponding subordinated debt securities affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the property 
trustee without the prior consent of each holder of the corresponding preferred securities. The trustees shall not 
revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the holders of the preferred securities except by 
subsequent vote of the holders of the preferred securities. The property trustee shall notify each holder of 
preferred securities of any notice of default with respect to the corresponding subordinated debt securities. In 
addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the holders of the preferred securities, prior to taking any of the 
foregoing actions, the trustees shall obtain an opinion of counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that the 
trust will not be classified as a corporation for United States Federal income tax purposes on account of such 
action. (Section 6.1) 
Any required approval or action of holders of preferred securities may be given or taken at a meeting of 
holders of preferred securities convened for such purpose or pursuant to written consent. The property trustee 
will cause a notice of any meeting at which holders of preferred securities are entitled to vote to be given to each 
holder of record of preferred securities in the manner set forth in the restated trust agreement. (Sections 6.2, 6.3 
and 6.6) 
No vote or consent of the holders of preferred securities will be required for the trust to redeem and cancel 
its preferred securities in accordance with the applicable restated trust agreement. 
Notwithstanding that holders of preferred securities are entitled to vote or consent under any of the 
circumstances described above, any of the preferred securities that are owned by us. the trustees or any affiliate 
of ours or any trustees, shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if they were not outstanding. 
Global Preferred Securities 
The preferred securities of the trust may be issued in whole or in pan in the form of one or more global 
preferred securities that will be deposited with, or on behalf of. the depositary identified in the prospectus 
supplement. 
The specific terms of the depositary arrangement with respect to the preferred securities of the trust will be 
described in the related prospectus supplement. We anticipate that the following provisions will generally apply 
to depositary arrangements. 
Upon the issuance of a global preferred security, and the deposit of such global preferred security with or on 
behalf of the depositary, the depositary for such global preferred security or its nominee will credit, on its book-
entry registration and transfer system, the respective aggregate liquidation amounts of the individual preferred 
securities represented by such global preferred securities to the accounts of participants. Such accounts shall be 
designated by the underwriters or agents with respect to such preferred securities or by us if such preferred 
securities are offered and sold directly by us. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global preferred security will 
be limited to participants or persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial 
interests in such global preferred security will be shown on. and the transfer of that ownership will be effected 
only through. records maintained by the depositary or its nominee with respect to interests of participants, and 
the records of participants with respect to interests of persons who hold through participants. The laws of some 
states require that certain purchasers of securities lake physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. 
Such limits and such laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global preferred security.
