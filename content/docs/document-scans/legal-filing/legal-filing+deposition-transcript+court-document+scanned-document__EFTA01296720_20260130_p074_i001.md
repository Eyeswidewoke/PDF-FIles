2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87203, * 
sole discretion; the Court will not foray into matters related to assessing the strength of the 
Government's case against Epstein. 
3 In response to Petitioners Request for Admission regarding whether the Government had a case for "federal prosecution 
against Epstein for many federal sex offenses," (DE 266 at 8), the Government responded: 
The government admits that the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida 
CUSAO") conducted an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") and developed evidence and 
information in contemplation of a potential federal prosecution against Epstein for many federal sex offenses. 
Except as otherwise admitted above. the government denies Request No. 1. 
(DE 213-1 at 1). 
Accordingly, because the Court will not--and cannot--endeavor to assess the strength ['15] 
of the Government's case against Epstein at the time it decided to enter into the non-
prosecution agreement, the Court concludes that Petitioners have not shown that they will 
suffer an injustice in this case if they are denied access to materials that the Government 
presented to grand juries during their investigation into whether Epstein committed federal 
crimes. Likewise, Petitioners have not shown that their need for these materials is 
compelling or particularized to their asserted interests under the CVRA. Therefore, the 
Court will deny Petitioners access to the materials over which grand jury secrecy applies 
under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e). 
3. Work Product Doctrine 
The Government asserts that many of the documents submitted are protected by the 
attorney work-product privilege. (DE 212-1 at 1-21; DE 216-1 at 1-14). These documents 
include draft correspondences and indictments, as well as attorney research and 
handwritten notes. (See, e.g., DE 212-1 at 2, 17). Petitioners argue that the work-product 
privilege is unavailable for a number of reasons. (DE 265 at 6, 8, 14-16). 
The work-product doctrine traces its roots to the Supreme Court's recognition that "it is 
essential that a lawyer work with a certain r 161 degree of privacy, free from unnecessary 
intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel." Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 510, 67 
S. Ct. 385, 91 L. Ed. 451 (1947). The privilege is codified at Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 26(b)(3): 
Ordinarily, a party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for 
trial by or for another party or its representative (including the other party's attorney, consultant. surety. indemnitor, 
insurer. or agent). But, subject to Rule 26(b)(4). those materials may be discovered if: 
(i) they are otherwise discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1); and 
(ii) the party shows that it has substantial need for the materials to prepare its case and cannot. without undue 
hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means. 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(A). Although fact-based work product may be disclosed on a 
showing of "substantial need," the court must avoid "disclosure of the mental impressions, 
conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party's attorney or other representative 
concerning the litigation." Id. 26(b)(3)(8). Such "opinion work product enjoys a nearly 
absolute immunity and can be discovered only in very rare and extraordinary 
circumstances." Cox v. Adm'r U.S. Steel & Carnegie, 17 F.3d 1386, 1422 (11th Cir. 1994).
