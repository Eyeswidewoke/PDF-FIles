THE TAX FREE ENTITY UNDER THE U.S. FLAG: 
A UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS EXEMPT COMPANY 
By William L. Blum, Esq. 
It will come as a surprise to many practitioners that the Internal Revenue Code provides an 
international tax planning tool with one very unusual feature: a corporate entity which enjoys all 
the non-tax advantages of incorporation in a United States jurisdiction, but without any federal or 
local income tax. The entity, known as a United States Virgin Islands exempt company, was 
authorized by the 1986 amendments to Section 934(b) of dic Internal Revenue Code. Implementing 
legislation was thereafter adopted by the Legislature of the Virgin Islands. This article discusses 
generally how territorial tax policy is formulated, the historical and policy background of the 
exempt company provisions, their technical application and requirements, and their practical 
application as a tax planning mechanism for selected non-United States owners. 
I. Historical, Policy and Legislative Background 
Formulation of Territorial Policy and Territorial Tax Policy 
The United States has sovereignty over several offshore areas located in the Eastern Caribbean 
and in both the North and South Pacific Ocean. These offshore areas are usually referred to as 
territories or possessions. The most economically and politically important of these territories are 
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, 
and American Samoa. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress is responsible for enacting laws 
regarding the territories. For the most part, Congress has provided for each of the above territories 
to be self-governing: each has authority to elect its own governor and legislature; and each has the 
authority to enact its own laws except in the few areas where Congress has withheld, and retained 
for itself, such authority. Although rarely exercised, Congress also retains its Constitutional power 
to invalidate laws enacted by territories. 
Congress also assists the territories in meeting their budgetary and fiscal needs. Generally there 
are three methods used to accomplish this: (1) continuing appropriations which are often tied to 
particular federal tax collections or other indicators; (2) annual appropriations that are either tied 
to specific projects or which may be applied by a territory to its general budget; and (3) 
participation in various federal programs which are specifically made applicable to the territories. 
While the levels of assistance in the second category were substantial historically, in the budget 
conscious years of the late seventies and eighties, the amount of assistance in this category has 
been steadily reduced and is now minimal. As the agency primarily responsible for holding the 
territorial purse strings, particularly in respect of the federal appropriations in the first two 
categories listed above, the Office of Territorial and International Affairs ("TIN') of the U.S. 
Department of Interior is generally responsible for most areas of territorial policy making and 
territorial-federal relations. TIA also has a separate budget for technical assistance grants to the 
territories which are typically used for such projects as computerization of territorial records or 
implementation of improvements to territorial government accounting systems and the like. 
Aside from these direct responsibilities in overseeing federal expenditures for territorial projects,
