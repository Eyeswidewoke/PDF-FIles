political paths for moderate Shiites and Sunnis to work=together against jihadists. "This should be also a wake-up call for 
t=e Iraqi government," he said. 
Why are the borders=of today's Middle Eastern states suddenly so porous and ineffectual? 
Just months after t=e United States military moved out of Iraq, Islamic extremists have captur=d several vulnerable cities 
on its borders. Jerry Seib discusses with Fore=gn Policy Editor Bob Ourlian about the developing situation. Photo:

The militants known=as ISIS wreaking havoc in Iraq are an 'Islamist' group. The terms 'Islamis=1 and 'Islam' are often used 
interchangeably, but there are very distinct =ifferences between them. 
In short, the confl=cts unleashed in Iraq and Syria have merged to become the epicenter of a s=ruggle between the 
region's historic ethnic and religious empires: Persian=Shiite Iran, Arab-Sunni Saudi Arabia and Turkic-Sunni Muslim 
Turkey. Those three, each of whom has dominated th= whole of the Middle East at one time or another in past 
millenniums, are =ow involved in the battle for influence from the Mediterranean to the Pers=an Gulf. 
Saudi Arabia, for e=ample, refuses to recognize the Shiite government of Iraq, backs an array =f almost exclusively Sunni 
Muslim rebel groups in Syria and bitterly oppos=s the Shiite Hezbollah. 
Iran conversely, is=the biggest backer of the Shiite-linked Syrian regime, has forged deep tie= to the Shiite-dominated 
Iraqi government and assures that Hezbollah, whic= Iran's Revolutionary Guards nurtured from its birth in the early 
1980s, remains impressively armed and trained.=/span> 
The U.S. also has p=ayed a role. In the wake of 9/11, it toppled Saddam Hussein, who had no co=nection to the attacks, 
and launched an effort to remake Iraq as a first s=ep to transform the region. 
The Arab uprisings =hree years ago ousted more iron-fisted rulers, whose authoritarian regimes=had kept ethnic and 
religious tensions in check. Syria's uprising reached =o resolution, and instead morphed into a festering civil war. Both 
sides have turned to religious and ethnic prop=ganda and brutality to maintain their advantage. 
The U.S. straddles =ome of the divisions. It supports the Shiite government it helped create i= Iraq, for example, while 
denouncing the Shiite-linked Syrian regime. Its =oppling of an Iraqi leader and encouragement of sectarian rule has 
helped fan tensions along religious and ethnic lines= The U.S. further undermined indigenous authority with its long, 
troubled =ccupation of Iraq as it sought to rebuild the country. 
Broader changes in =he global power structure also have helped unleash change. For decades, th= Middle East was 
locked in place by the Cold War and petro politics. The U=S. supported countries opposed to the Soviet Union and rich in 
oil—Persian Gulf monarchies, Jordan and Egypt s=arting in the mid-1970s—while the Soviets supported their friends—
Syri=, Iraq, Libya at times and South Yemen. The U.S. backed a lot of anti-demo=ratic and despotic regimes, but the 
result was relative stability. 
Now, though, the Co=d War framework has been shattered, and the growth of new energy sources e=sewhere has 
reduced the premium placed on stability. 
The trouble for the=U.S. and regional powers is that the conflict may have outrun their contro=, fueled by the rise of the 
most pernicious groups in chaotic conditions.<=span> 
ISIS is a threat fo= both Turkey and Saudi Arabia, but its easy conquests over the past week=97including Mosul, Iraq's 
second-largest city—were made possible by gove=nments hobbled by years of insurgency and opposition aided by those 
two countries and like-minded Arab Gulf resident=.
