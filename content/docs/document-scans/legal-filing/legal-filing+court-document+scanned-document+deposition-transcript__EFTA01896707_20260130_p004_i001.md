The Down/on Aferhants The merchants of Downtown Charlotte Amalie represent a robust and diverse 
contingent of retail ranging from perfume and jewelry to restaurants and apparel. it is the core of the 
"authentic" St. Thomas tourist experience. 
III. 
A Fragmented and Non-Strategic Approach 
Unlike St. Maarten and other emerging destinations, the USVI's approach to the entire cruise ship industry appears 
fragmented and somewhat non-strategic. In part, this may have been a result of a less competitive landscape. 
However, as the global economy deteriorated and competition from neighboring islands has grown, the lack of a 
holistic strategy has become a more apparent impediment to growth of small businesses and has placed this critical 
component of the USVI economy at greater risk from outside competitors. 
A. The Opportunity to Leverage Port Infrastructure 
At present, VIPA and WICO, two different instrumentalities of the USVI government, each with its own 
staff members arc independently operating the cruise ship infrastructure of the USVI which consists of 5 
total docks (3 at %VICO and 2 at Crown Bay). Of the 5 total berths, not all are the same and certain 
berths are better suited to accommodate larger vessels. Additionally, certain lines may prefer to berth at 
one facility versus the other. Each of WICO and the VIPA has its own strategy, administration and 
approach to the business. For example, we understand that the Austin "Babe" Monsanto Marine Facility 
entered into long tern preferential berthing agreements with Holland America and Princess (which we 
understand are set to expire in a few years) while WICO (whose largest customers are Royal Caribbean, 
Carnival and Disney) prefers not to enter into any long term preferential berthing contracts. Each agency 
has in effect a different set of policies and procedures for taking reservations from cruise lines — with 
WICO accepting soft reservations over a year in advance and Crown Bay unable to accept reservations 
(other than for Holland and Princess) outside of a 30-day window. It is our understanding that neither 
agency employs any yield management or other strategy to enhance revenues during peak demand. 
We also understand that VIPA charges a set fee per passenger at both the WICO dock and the Crown 
Bay Dock. At the Crown Bay Dock, VIPA charges a fixed retail fee to cruise lines and a discounted fee to 
Holland and Princess which have long term requirements contracts (the "VIPA Crown Bay Fee'). At the 
WICO dock, the per passenger fee is broken into completely separate components. The VIPA charges a 
fee which is lower than its Crown Bay fee for all passengers disembarking at the WICO dock (the "VIPA-
Havensight Fee"). VIPA provides no services to either passengers or cruise lines at the WICO dock in 
exchange for this fee. The cruise lines remit these fees directly to VIPA. We understand that WICO 
separately charges a per passenger fee (the "WICO Fee') in addition to the VIPA-Havensieit Fee. We 
understand that together the VIPA fees charged by WICO plus the VIPA-Havensight Fee roughly equal 
the total undiscounted fee charged by VIPA at Crown Bay. WICO does not have control over or 
influence with respect to the VIPA-Havensight Fee. 
These vastly different berthing strategies, uncoordinated operational structures and disjointed pricing 
represent inherent limits on the Territory's ability to maximize the value of its infrastructure. The USVI 
has one of the largest inventories of cruise line berths in the Caribbean as well as very high demand 
relative to the rest of the market. An opportunity exists to develop a coordinated strategic, operational 
and marketing approach to fully leveraging its strategic US location, existing infrastructure and duty 
exemption allowance to drive overall per passenger pricing and revenues, increase total berth occupancies 
(including in St. Croix) and berth efficiency as well as meet the growing needs of the cruise lines. Further, 
the existing fee structure has several significant drawbacks for both the Territory and in particular, WICO. 
The two agency system (or at a minimum the inability of the two agencies to enter into a formal 
agreement regarding the strategic approach to inventory and pricing) has resulted in what appears to be 
either an artificial competition which may be keeping per passenger prices artificially low or a failure to 
fully examine a collective ability to manage its pricing based on overall product demand. Correcting this 
structural inefficiency can create tremendous competitive advantage for St. Thomas in competing with 
other destinations.
