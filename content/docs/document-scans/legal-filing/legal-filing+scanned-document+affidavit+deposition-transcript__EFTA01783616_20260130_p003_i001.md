Respondable is also available as part of Boomerang for Outlook - if you wa=t to use it in Outlook, visit 
http://www.boomerangoutlook.com <http://baydin.usl.list-
manage.=om/track/click?u=0eca1021e28174a9a30df3a88&id=61f38c8a3b&e==be669948b> t= install. 
Can I turn Respondable off? 
Yes. If you'd rather not see Respondable, just click the Boomerang butto= in the top right corner, choose Settings, and 
then uncheck the box l=beled "Enable Respondable" 
Is Boomerang reading my emails? 
No. By default, Boomerang Respondable works entirely within your browser=2E It does not transmit any message data 
anywhere, for any purpose. If yo= choose to enable advanced machine learning features, Boomerang transmi=s message 
data using enterprise-grade encryption, analyzes the message=data on a secure server, then transmits the analysis back 
via encrypted=communication channels. After performing the analysis, Boomerang's serv=rs immediately discard any 
personally-identifiable information connected=with the analysis. Boomerang employees do not have access to any 
message=data transmitted as part of your use of Respondable. 
Do I have to pay? 
Access to Respondable for unlimited messages is included in the free Basic=plan. Advanced features, including positivity, 
politeness, and subj=ctivity are available for users on Boomerang for Gmail's Pro and=Premium plans. Because these 
advanced features require several layers of=machine learning, all calculated in real-time, they are expensive for=us to 
provide. You can find out which plan you are currently subscribed t= by visiting the Boomerang manage page

Machine learning sounds complicated. Does Respondable slow Gmail d=wn? 
Thanks to new technology in HTMLS, we were able to build Respondable in=a way that does not slow Gmail down. All of 
the calculations for the basis version of Respondable are performed in a background worker thread that=does not 
interfere with the Gmail UI. Calculations related to advanced fe=tures are performed in the cloud via a proprietary 
architecture we develo=ed to allow us to deploy machine learning that operates in real-time. It=also doesn't slow down 
the Gmail UI. 
If you're interested in the technology behind Respondable, we =8011 be doing a technical talk about its architecture at a 
later date=2C and we'll also be writing a super geeky blog post about how we=built it - stay tuned! If you're really 
interested in the technol=gy behind Respondable, we're looking for engineers <http://baydin.usl.list-

I added a rude word, but it said my politeness increased. Or I a=ded a negative word, but Respondable's positivity score 
increas=d. What gives? 
You've discovered one of the limitations of artificial intelligenc= in its current form. In any individual email, the machine 
learning can=arrive at answers that do not make sense. In those cases, trust your ju=gment rather than the calculation. 
Politeness, positivity, and subjectivity rely on machine learning tech=iques that compare your writing to other samples 
of text that were used a= training data. Because there's no "objective" se= of data that can translate how positive, 
polite, or subjective a set=of words is, the machine learning techniques look for similarities betw=en your writing and 
writing samples that come with an approximate numeric." score for positivity, politeness, or subjectivity. One common 
sourc= of positivity training data is actually movie reviews - words that appea= in reviews for poorly-rated movies tend 
to be more negative! 
As a result, if a bunch of movies about asteroids all got panned by movi= critics, and words about asteroids were not 
present in other training=data, it's possible that the neural networks could conclude tha= those words add negativity to
