authorities to grapple with record numbers of new cases and hospitalizations." Bloomberg adds, 
"The president could help by asking Americans directly to wear masks, encouraging Republican 
governors to do more to slow the spread, publicly backing health officials or even directing his 
staff to jointly coordinate with President-elect Joe Biden's transition team, to ensure a smooth 
hand-off, health experts say. Trump has instead been absent. He's discouraged masks and 
social distancing and is blocking the start of Biden's transition while refusing to concede defeat, 
compounding the federal inaction." 
Slaoui: 20 Million Americans Could Get Vaccine Next Month. Politico (11/13, 
Owermohle, 4.29M) reports Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific advisor to Operation Warp Speed, on 
Friday said 20 million people in the US could receive a coronavirus vaccine in December with 
25-30 million people nationwide being vaccinated in the following months, although "that 
timeline depends on the Food and Drug Administration authorizing the emergency use of one or 
more vaccines — which could happen in a matter of weeks, Slaoui noted." 
Vaccine Hesitancy, Supply Chain Among Hurdles To Vaccine Distribution. The 
Washington Post (11/13, Fadulu, 14.2M) reports, "Regional coordination will be paramount for 
the successful distribution of an eventual coronavirus vaccine, a D.C. health official told the 
Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments on Thursday, and overcoming mistrust among 
communities of color will be essential." The tense history of experimentation - including the 
Tuskegee Study - have made "vaccines...a touchy subject for" people of color. Additional 
logistical challenges remain, particularly cold storage, as "both the Pfizer vaccine and one being 
developed by Moderna must be stored at negative 70 degrees Celsius." 
Meanwhile, Reuters (11/13, Baertlein, O'Donnell) reports US states, cities, and hospitals 
"are scrambling to buy ultra-cold freezers that can safely store Pfizer Inc's COVID-19 vaccine, 
ignoring advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to hold off." 
According to Reuters, "The push reveals a lack of infrastructure to support a super cold vaccine 
campaign, including equipment to store millions of doses of Pfizer's vaccine at temperatures of 
minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 
degrees Celsius (36-46°F)." 
CDC Urges Americans To Wear Masks. 
On NBC Nightly NewsVI (11/13, story 10, 1:34, Holt, 5.27M), Vicky Nguyen reported that as 
the coronavirus continues to spread, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention "wants 
Americans to masking up to protect our health and help save our economy. Research shows 
masks capture the droplets from our breath, cough or sneeze and also dilute whatever escapes, 
adding social distancing and good air circulation and COVID risk goes way down." Nguyen 
added the CDC "recommends a fitted face covering over your nose and mouth. It can be as 
simple as a disposable mask. If you wear a cloth mask, just make sure it has at least two layers 
of fabric. Wash those cloth masks frequently and while not recommended, you can reuse the 
disposable ones if they're clean and dry. And with holiday gatherings coming up, wear a mask 
when you're not eating." 
The New York Times (11/13, Mandavilli, 18.61M) reports the CDC's most recent 
recommendations "have been as notable for what they do not say as for what they do," as the 
agency, in a turnabout, is now "hewing more closely to a scientific evidence, often contradicting 
the positions of the Trump administration." The CDC in briefs published Tuesday "described the 
benefits of masks to wearers, not just to those around them." Agency researchers "also urged 
people to celebrate Thanksgiving only with others in their households or, failing that, to wear a 
mask with two or more layers." However, the Times says officials at the CDC "have not publicly 
announced these findings nor held news conferences to explain them, instead posting the 
bulletins quietly online. Word of them has often appeared first on Twitter and noted by outside 
experts. Dr. Robert Redfield, the agency's director appointed by Mr. Trump, has remained 
largely silent despite record-breaking numbers of coronavirus cases."
