unsu=tainable in both military and diplomatic terms, and that the United States=will inevitably have to divert from its 
current posture to a new, more sus=ainable role. 
Engines of a Para=igm Shift 
To be clear, a signi=icant U.S. leadership role in world politics remains important and viable.=But the current paradigm 
suffers from cracks in a number of key foundation=l areas. This essay briefly summarizes five: disappearing 
finances;rising alternative power centers; declining U.=. military predominance; a lack of efficacy of key non-military 
instrument= of power; and reduced domestic patience for global adventures. These thre=ts to U.S. strategic solvency 
have existed for decades but they are accelerating, and maturing, in new and de=isive ways. 
The first threat is =udgetary. Debt is set to rise significantly over the next decade, in some =cenarios approaching 100 
percent of GDP shortly after 2020, along with int=rest payments by one estimate, rising from $146 billion in 2010 to over 
$800 billion in 2020.8 This has already =aised fears of downgraded U.S. credit ratings and threats to the dollar as=a 
reserve currency. The corresponding social austerity and financial press=res at all levels of government, as well as a 
public hostility to taxes, mean that spending cuts will bear =he burden of deficit reduction.9 In recognition of this, 
several bipartisa= budget proposals include major defense cuts. Groups pushing for serious d=ficit control have aimed 
for $800 billion to over $1 trillion in ten-year defense reductions, and even those=may be just a down payment on a 
larger bill to follow. Further, the defens= budget faces its own internal budget issues: for example, Tricare, the mi=itary's 
health program, costs the Department of Defense triple the amount of just a decade ago, and the annu=l costs of the 
military pension program may balloon from just over $52 bil=ion in 2011 to as much as $117 billion by 2035.10 This is 
putting further =ressure on those components of the defense budget essential to global strategy and power projection. 
A second trend is th= rise of alternative centers of power: states and influential non-state ac=ors are clamoring to set 
the global affairs agenda and determine key outco=es.11 A fundamental reality of the last two or more decades has 
been an emerging reaction against U.S. primac= many others desire that U.S. influence decline and contrary centers of 
po=er strengthen.12 This trend is now accelerating, and the coming decade see=s certain to represent the full 
emergence of an international system of more assertive powers who are less=interested in dominant U.S. leadership. 
More and more nations, from Brazil=to Turkey to India, while far from "anti-American" in their foreign poli=y or hostile 
to American leadership per se, have become disaffected with the idea of a U.S.-centric world orde=, and are determined 
to squeeze out U.S. influence on certain issues to cl=im greater influence for themselves. Related to this is a set of 
geopoliti=al trends reducing the perceived salience of American power: The end of the Cold War reduced the perceived 
=rgency for U.S. protection; the Arab Spring and other developments have br=ught to power governments uninterested 
in U.S. sponsorship; and the reacti=n to globalization, including reaffirmations of ethnic, religious, and national identity, 
has in some places spilled ov=r into a resentment of American social and cultural hegemony. 
A third trend is dec=ining U.S. military predominance and a fast-approaching moment when the Un=ted States will be 
unable to project power into key regions of the world. =he reasons are partly technological rising actors have 
burgeoning capabilities in anti-ship missiles, drones, =r other "area denial" structures.13 Moreover, actors have also 
found oth=r ways to counter American power: major states like China or Russia now po=sess the ability through 
financial, space, or energy means to threaten massive global consequences in response=to unwanted U.S. force. This 
includes cyber mayhem: as one recent survey c=ncluded, cyber weapons "allow, for the first time in history, small state= 
with minimal defense budgets to inflict serious harm on a vastly stronger foe at extreme ranges," a new f=rm of 
vulnerability that would "greatly constrain America's use of force =broad."14 An important new RAND report by Paul 
Davis and Peter Wilson war=s of an "impending crisis in defense planning" arising "from technology diffusion that is 
leveling aspects of=the playing field militarily, geostrategic changes, and the range of poten=ial adversaries."15 These 
challenges are exacerbated by a crisis of defen=e procurement; America's leading-edge military systems are becoming 
less affordable and reliable. Aircraft carri=rs, for example, have become prohibitively expensive, with costs set to br=ak 
through congressionally-imposed limits next year.16 The systems that un=ergird U.S. military primacy are being whittled 
down to a small handful that no president will readily risk=in anything but the most essential of crises. A fourth threat to 
U.S. glob=l strategy is that America's non-military tools of influence have proven i=capable of achieving key U.S. goals in 
the areas nominated as the leading security challenges of the future tr=nsnational, sub-state threats, and the risks
