The Front End 
The front end is all about the timing and speed of lift off. Speed will probably 
be more important than even timing in that the market twill easily absorb a one 
and done Fed. Speed can also backfire in that if risk assets behave poorly for 
any given speed, the Fe won't be making their terminal rate in one swoop. An 
intra tightening period of stable Funds would allow for a sharp re-rally in short 
rates at some stage (Note 5s typically converge to Funds at the end of a 
tightening cycle, so any sense that the fed would initiate a pause for several 
quarters would allow substantial spread convergence in our view). 
We remain of the view that this Fed does not want to commit the type 2 error 
and will be hard pressed to even begin raising rats in 2015. The bar is low for 
them to delay in that if the payroll report is all they have to go on, a soft patch 
in jobs could easily prompt ongoing delay. Using private final demand the long 
run output gap has barely improved since the crisis. One has to go the other 
extreme, to measure the gap from 2009 to argue that the gap has in fact 
closed. Either way the link with inflation has become tenuous.

In terms of wage inflation below we update our wage model to incorporate the 
Fed's new NAIRU estimates. If unemployment does not continue to fall, there 
is still no wage acceleration. If it does then with the lower NAIRU estimates 
wage acceleration is still delayed until late 2015 - all consistent with a Fed 
struggling to raise rates. 
Unemployment 
Model 
In order to understand the relationship between wage acceleration and 
unemployment, we first project the year-over-year change in the growth rate of 
the average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers (ARE) 
on two variables. The first is a dummy variable that equals one if the 
unemployment rate is less than the CBO's estimate of the NAIRU, and equals 
zero otherwise, and the second is the year-over-year change in the 
unemployment rate. The thought experiment is that wage inflation should be 
affected by whether there is slack in the labor market and by the trajectory of 
job growth. As shown in the chart below, the above-discussed variables are 
able to explain a fair amount of the variation in wage acceleration: the R-
squared of the regression is 33°k.
