Statement Period: 0810112016 • 08/31/2016 
Pricing 
This section inckrdes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including short positions, at the close of the statement period. The market prices, unless otherwise noted, 
have been obtained from independent vendor services, which we believe to be reliable. Market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ from the actual sale price. Securities for which a price is 
not available are marked "NIA" and are omitted from the Total. 
THE AS OF PRICE DATE ONLY APPEARS WHEN THE PRICE DATE DOES NOT EQUAL THE STATEMENT DATE. 
The pr cing of securities on this statement may vary from their actual liquidation value. Prices shown should only be used as a general guide to portfolio value. Cash shown in this statement may not necessarily 
be available for investment due to unsettled transactions against your account(s). Prices for marketable securities are received from various pricing services thought to be reliable; however, pricing services are 
sometimes unable to provide timely information. Where pricing sources are not readily available, estimated prices may be used. When the updated price is received from the price provider, the updated price will 
be used in the release of the current month's statement. Prior statements will not be revised. You should always request a current valuation for your securities prior to making a financial decision or placing an 
order. 
Deutsche Bank proprietary investments and miscellaneous assets held by Discretionary Accounts, Trust Accounts and Custody Accounts include several categories of securities. Miscellaneous foreign assets 
are priced via third party sources believed to be reliable. 
For certain securities, including thinly4raded securities, debt securities in default, securities that do not have a valid pricing source, and certain third-party structured products, the last available pricing MP be 
listed. If the last price available for such securities is unchanged for a period of time deemed appropriate for that asset, the current price will purge and WA will be placed in the price field in the statement. The 
pricing of ksted options takes into account the last closing price, as well as the current bid and offer prices. 
Estimated Annual Figures 
The estimated annual income (EAI) and estimated annual yield (EAY) figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. These figures are no considered to be a forecast or guarantee of future results. 
These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable, however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, 
and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be retied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position 
quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant A capital gain or retum of principal may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to 
%vim. pershing.comibusiness_continuityhtml for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received. 
Reinvestment 
The dollar amount of Mutual Fund disthbutions, Money Market Fund dividend income, Bank Deposit interest income, or dividends for other securities shown on your statement may have been reinvested. You will 
not receive confirmation of these reinvestments. Upon written request to your financial institution, information pertaining to these transactions, including the time of execution and the name of the person from 
whom your security was purchased, may be obtained. In dividend reinvestment transactions, Pershing acts as your agent and receives payment for order lbw. 
Options 
Information with respect to commissions and other charges incurred in connection with the execution of option transactions has been included in confirmations previously furnished to you. A summary of this 
information is available to you promptly upon your written request directed to your introducing firm. In order to assist your introducing firm in maintaining current background and financial information concerning 
your option accounts. please promptly advise them in writing of any material change in your investment objectives or financial situation. Expiring options which are valuable are exercised automatically pursuant to 
the exercise by exception procedure of the Options Clearing Corporation. Additional information regarding this procedure is available upon written request to your introducing firm. 
Proxy Vote 
Securities not fully paid for in your margin account may be lent by Pershing to itself or others in accordance with the terms outlined in the Margin Agreement. The right to vote your shares held on margin may be 
reduced by the amount of shares on loan. The Proxy Voting Instruction Form sent to you may reflect a smaller number of shares entitled to vote than the number of shares in your margin account.
