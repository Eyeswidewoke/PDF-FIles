Monthly Payment-Minimum Amount Due (Effective with billing periods ending in October 2004) 
We are changing the calculation of the Minimum Amount Due on your Account. In some cases, as described below, we will Increase the 
Minimum Amount Due by 515. Accordingly, we are replacing the third paragraph of your Agreement entitled Billing Statements/Minimum 
Amount Due Wth the following: 
"Each biting statement will reflect a Minimum Amount Due. Payment is due by the time and date shown and In the manner 
prescribed on the statement To calculate the Minimum Amount Due we will add together the following: 
(1) any amount past due; 
(2) the greatest of: 
a) 
1/50th of the New Balance on the Closing Date of the biting statement (the calculation of which is rounded to 
the nearest whole dollar) (for purposes of this calculation we exclude from the New Balance any over-limit fee 
added to your Account during the billing period), 
b) 
the current billed Finance Charges, or 
c) 
515 (or the New Balance If it is less than $15); and 
(3) any over-lima fee added to your Account during the billing period. 
If the greatest of the three calculations in section (2) above is the current billed Finance Charges, then we will add 515 to the 
calculation of the Minimum Amount Due. At our option, we may also include in the Minimum Amount Due all or part of other fees 
incurred during the biting period and any part of the New Balance in excess of your credit line. 
The Minimum Amount Due will not exceed the New Balance. You may pay more than the Minimum Amount Due, up to the entire 
outstanding balance, at any time?
