As for the survivin= monarchies in the Middle East, they too will likely be less accommodating=to American military 
forces than they have been in the past. To be sure, m=ch of the Arab support for past American military operations --
like both Iraq wars -- was hidden from the public e.e. Arab states often loudly and publicly denounced "unilateral 
Americ=n" military action in the region at the same time as they supported i= in backroom dealings, quietly authorizing 
facilities support and air, land, and sea access. 
But if Arab Gulf st=tes were quietly supportive in the past, their opposition to American mili=ary force is likely to grow in 
the future. They read the aftermath of the =rab uprisings much differently than did American and European 
policymakers. The Gulf monarchies were shocked t=at the United States "abandoned" Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubara= in his time of need in early 2011. Their leaders expected the United Stat=s to push for Mubarak and the 
Egyptian military to crack down on public protests in Cairo. After all, American policymaker= during the Carter 
administration had at least given this policy option co=sideration during the Iranian revolution in 1979. 
Already, several Gu=f states have begun to translate their displeasure into policy independenc= from Washington. In 
2011, for example, a coalition of Gulf states led by =audi Arabia intervened in Bahrain to quell domestic unrest in the 
island country. They did so under the banner =f the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which for years had been a feckless 
=ilitary force. Largely unnoticed in Western commentary was that the GCC, f=r the first time in its history, mounted a 
relatively effective military intervention. 
Bahrain today is fo= all intents and purposes a province of Saudi Arabia, even if it is not po=ite to say so in diplomatic 
circles. Since the Iranian revolution, Bahrain=-- like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar -- has pursued 
close ties with the United States, in signi=icant measure to counterbalance Iran and Saudi Arabia. With Washington at 
=heir back, they were able to stake out security policies that were at leas= nominally independent from Saudi Arabia. 
When Saudi Arabia wanted American forces removed from the kingdom =for example, Qatar was eager to compensate 
by hosting a more robust Americ=n command presence in the region. 
The Arab uprisings =nd subsequent GCC intervention in Bahrain have turned the tables, making S=udi security backing a 
necessity for the smaller Gulf monarchies. From the=r perspective, American forces are clearly more capable than Saudi 
forces, but given the alignment of their i=terests, Riyadh is a more reliable security partner. Gulf leaders and mili=ary 
commanders in the coming decade will be focused on how to avoid follow=ng in Mubarak's footsteps. Part of minimizing 
that risk will involve decreasing security dependency on the=United States. Gulf leaders have to worry that if push 
comes to shove, the=Americans will throw them under a bus just like they did to Mubarak. 
If the political dy=amics in the Middle East and South Asia do not favor further American mili=ary intervention in the 
future, neither do the emerging military trends. T=e proliferation of supersonic cruise missiles and mines in the region 
will make for nasty forced entries <http://be=fercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18409/closing_time.html> into 
narrow maritime confines like the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. =/span> 
But the likely prol=feration of nuclear weapons -- and ballistic missile delivery systems -- w=ll pose even more 
formidable challenges to conventional military surges in=the region. In the future, the United States will not be able to 
take for granted unchallenged surges of naval, =ir, and ground forces into regional theaters via logistics hubs. These 
hub= -- like the American naval presence in Bahrain -- are large, readily iden=ifiable, and will be increasingly vulnerable 
to future targeting by nuclear weaponry. 
Iran's nuclear weap=ns, assuming it gets them, will pose a direct threat to American military =urge capabilities. Although 
American policymakers and military commanders =ight feel confident that they could surge forces into the Gulf despite 
Iranian nuclear threats because of the =merican nuclear deterrent, Gulf security partners might be more nervous an= 
less willing to cooperate. As a result, they might not grant access to U.=. air, naval, and ground forces out of fear of 
angering Iran.
