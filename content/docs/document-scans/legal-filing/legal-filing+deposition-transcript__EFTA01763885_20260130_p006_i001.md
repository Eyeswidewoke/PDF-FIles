for some time: Its worst kept secret is that Khaled Meshal, H=mas's leader, has had a house there for many years and 
has been increasing=y seen in Doha since Hamas was forced to leave 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/28/world/middleeast/khaled=meshal-the-leader-of-hamas-vacates-
damascus.html> Syria in early 2012. Doha has also opened its pocketbook to Hamas, pled=ing 
<http://www=reuters.com/artide/2012/10/23/palestinians-gaza-qatar-idUSL5E8LNISNIX201210=3> $250 million in 
February -- a gift that was increased to $400 million upon=the emir's visit. 
The injection of funds, however, is =ot the most important aspect of Sheikh Hamad's trip. By breaking Hamas's r=gional 
isolation and explicitly recognizing its rule over Gaza, Doha has strengthened the militant group's hand agains= its 
Palestinian rivals. An official from the Palestinian Authority, which=is in charge of the West Bank, begrudgingly 
welcomed the visit while noting 
<http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/AleqM5j5N1Wfi5=DJ9Ec3bdFWw2yvt0CeFg?docId=a40c2cc342144bb6 
87f736cfeb13302c> that "no one should deal with Gaza as a separate entity from the Palestinian territories and f=om 
the Palestinian Authority." 
Unlike the Palestinian Authority, Is=ael felt no need to Israel soften its criticism. An Israeli spokesman carp=d bitterly 
about the emir's trip, saying=/font> <http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4295973,00.html= target=> that the 
emir was "throwing=peace under a bus." 
The visit further highlights Israel'= loss of influence with Qatar. Relations between the two countries warmed =ith the 
opening of an Israeli trade office in Doha in 1996 (reputedly close to Meshal's house) as the two sides looke= to ship 
Qatari gas to Israel, with Enron acting <http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/20/business/deal-by-enron-=ith-qatar.html> 
as the intermedia=y. The deal failed, however, and relations ebbed and flowed until December 2008, when Qatar cut 
ties in protest of Is=ael's offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Rumors that Doha was atte=pting to restart relations 
were finally put to rest with a leaked memo fro= Israel's Foreign Ministry labelling 
<http://www.nrg.co.il/online/l/ART2/275/145.html?hp=1&am=;cat=404&loc=2> Qatar =s a "leading activist" against 
Israel, decisively cutting whatever informal relations remained. 
The Iranian angle 
Iran, with whom Qatar maintains cord=al official relations, joins Israel and the Palestinian Authority in an un=ikely 
triumvirate watching proceedings in Gaza with glum resignation. Tehran officials are doubtlessly looking ba=k 
nostalgically to happier times only a few years back, when their proxy H=zbollah all but defeated the Zionist Entity --
winning Iran no small degre= of Arab support for its material support to the Lebanese militant organization. Back then, 
Hamas was also s=ill ensconced in Iran's camp, and Syria was a stable ally that appeared to=be gradually increasing its 
influence in the Middle East. 
Indeed, while Israel and the Palesti=ian Authority may view Qatar's embrace of Hamas with chagrin, it is Iran t=at is the 
central loser in this drama. The emir's visit is part of a larger Qatari policy to unseat and reorient =rucial Iranian allies 
around the Middle East -- and by extension, amputate=a long-used, effective limb of Iranian foreign policy. This is a 
remarkabl= forthright policy, for Iran will not -- and cannot -- take it lying down. 
This new policy is most evident in S=ria, where Qatar is explicitly and unashamedly supporting 
<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000087239639044368410457=062842929673074.html> the 19-month insurgency 
with mone=, equipment, and at the very least light weaponry -- little less than a de=laration of war against President 
Bashar al-Assad, Iran's core ally. 
But Qatar's new activism is also app=rent in Gaza, where Doha has likely decided to take action precisely becau=e of 
Hamas's break from Iran. When Tehran stopped <http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/21/us-palestinians=hamas-
finance-idUSTRE77K18320110821> sending money to Hamas after the =roup failed to publically support Iran's 
embattled ally in Syria, Qatar sa= an opportunity to split the Palestinian group from its long-time sponsor.=While its 
$400 million donation is earmarked for humanitarian development, not only is such support fungible,=but there are
