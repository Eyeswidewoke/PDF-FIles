HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Generally, an exempt organization is exempt from Federal income tax on its passive 
investment income, such as dividends, interest and capital gains, whether realized by the 
organization directly or indirectly through a partnership in which it is a partner.12 This type of 
income is exempt even if it is realized from securities trading activity which constitutes a trade or 
business. In addition, certain real estate rents and real property gains are also exempt in certain 
circumstances. 
This general exemption from tax does not apply to the "unrelated business taxable income" 
("UBIT) of an exempt organization. Generally, except as noted above with respect to certain 
categories of exempt trading activity, UBTI includes income or gain derived (either directly or 
through partnerships) from a trade or business, the conduct of which is substantially unrelated to 
the exercise or performance of the organization's exempt purpose or function. 
Separate 
calculations are made for each unrelated trade or business of the exempt organization, with losses 
usable only against the applicable unrelated trade or business and not against all UBTI generally. 
With respect to its investments in partnerships engaged in a trade or business (including certain 
MLPs), the Partnership's income (or loss) from these investments may constitute UBTI. 
UBTI also includes "unrelated debt-financed income," which generally consists of (i) 
income derived by an exempt organization (directly or through a partnership) from 
income-producing property with respect to which there is "acquisition indebtedness" at any time 
during the taxable year, and (ii) gains derived by an exempt organization (directly or through a 
partnership) from the disposition of property with respect to which there is "acquisition 
indebtedness" at any time during the twelve-month period ending with the date of such disposition. 
The Partnership may incur "acquisition indebtedness" with respect to certain of its 
transactions, such as the purchase of securities on margin. Based upon a published ruling issued 
by the Service which generally holds that income and gain with respect to short sales of publicly 
traded stock does not constitute income from debt financed property for purposes of computing 
UBTI, the Partnership will treat its short sales of securities as not involving "acquisition 
indebtedness" and therefore not resulting in UBTI.13 To the extent the Partnership recognizes 
income i.e. dividends and interest) from securities with respect to which there is "acquisition 
indebtedness" during a taxable year, the percentage of such income which will be treated as UBTI 
generally will be based on the percentage which the "average acquisition indebtedness" incurred 
with respect to such securities is of the "average amount of the adjusted basis" of such securities 
during the taxable year. 
To the extent the Partnership recognizes gain from securities with respect to which there is 
"acquisition indebtedness" at any time during the twelve-month period ending with the date of 
their disposition, the percentage of such gain which will be treated as UBTI will be based on the 
percentage which the highest amount of such "acquisition indebtedness" is of the "average amount 
12 
With certain exceptions. tax-exempt organizations which are private foundations are subject to a 2% Federal 
excise tax on their "net investment income." The rate of the excise tax for any taxable year may be reduced to 1% if 
the private foundation meets certain distribution requirements for the taxable year. A private foundation will be 
required to make payments of estimated tax with respect to this excise tax.

Moreover, income realized from option writing and futures contract transactions generally would not 
constitute UBTI.
