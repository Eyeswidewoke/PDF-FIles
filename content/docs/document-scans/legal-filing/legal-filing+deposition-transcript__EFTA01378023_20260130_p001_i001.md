In addition to what is included in the table above, as of September 30, 2015, we may be required to pay, in connection with our acquisitions, up to an 
additional $170.3 million of cash consideration based on the combination of earnings performance and user growth at the businesses acquired. A substantial 
portion of the $170.3 million maximum liability ($81.7 million) relates to the contingent consideration arrangement entered into in connection with one 
acquisition, which has its final measurement period at the end of 2015. Based on current forecasts and the fact that the relevant measurement period for that 
acquisition Is nearly completed, the Company believes that it will not have to make any further payments with respect to this acquisition. The Company has 
other contingent consideration arrangements for which it has accrued $28.6 million as of September 30, 2015. 
We also had $0.3 million of surety bonds outstanding as of September 30. 2015 that could potentially require performance by the Company in the event of 
demands by third parties or contingent events.
