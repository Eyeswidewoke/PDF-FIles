management team, who collaboratively oversee IPI's three offices. In addition, two non-
governing Advisory Boards provide input to IPI's New York and Vienna offices, respectively, as 
needed. 
■ 
Similar types of projects IPI has undertaken in the past. including the goals of those projects 
and success in relation to those goals: 
Since 2006, IPI's flagship research program, Coping with Crisis, Conflict, and Change (CWC), has 
provided policymakers with analyses of conflict management tools and transnational threats to 
peace and security and offered a platform for decision makers to build consensus on ways to 
strengthen multilateral response capacity. CWC will serve as a model for the work IPI will 
conduct on peace and health, which will involve exploring new linkages and trends and putting 
forth recommendations for international institutions to address them. 
In recent years IPI's Middle East Program has carried out numerous survey projects with 
similarities to the one proposed on polio eradication. Through these projects, IPI gained 
experience with field-based, in-person polling, as well as phone banks. The surveys aimed to 
develop portraits of key groups, issues, and motivators in the region in order to better 
understand the current situation and produce up-to-date and relevant policy research. The polls 
received wide, international media coverage. Using the polling data, plus fresh analysis on the 
issues, IPI developed visual presentations to describe trends and challenges in the region. IPI's 
polling results and related presentations have been given at its ministerial dinners and to 
constituents in New York, Washington, DC, and in European and Asian capitals.

Additionally, as part of its Arab Youth Project, IPI conducted interviews in Egypt in 2012 to 
develop an understanding of the shifting aspirations and activism of the youth. Through the 
publication of the project's findings and related convening, IPI is providing policymakers with an 
insight into the youth's priorities and their role as influencers within the Arab world's new 
political landscape. 
IPI's Peace without Crime project has developed a methodology for analyzing organized crime in 
fragile states and IPI staff members have experience as a result of this, and other projects, with 
operating in difficult environments. 
■ Unique characteristics/activities of IPI that make it particularly well-suited to implement this 
Project: 
IPI's niche lies in its ability to generate cutting-edge research, policy analysis and 
recommendations, and to reach and influence policymakers at all levels. These qualities would 
be fully leveraged for the benefit of the project. 
IPI's work is disseminated through the organization of more than 100 events in New York and 
Vienna each year, including conferences, workshops and roundtable meetings; and two 
ministerial working dinners on the Middle East at the opening of the UN General Assembly each 
September. Through its convening activities, IPI enjoys direct and frequent access to 
policymakers, with the UN secretariat and member states making up more than two thirds of 
participants. The purpose of these meetings is to promote a better understanding of issues as 
well as the emergence of common ground.
