I am =ften asked to give my views and to rate the distinguished list of =nbsp;todays various financiers. I hesitate to do 
so as my area of =xpertise is now philanthropy and was formerly technology, =nbsp;Money is a product of my past 
endeavors and the leverage for my =uture social goas. That being said, without a doubt , one =f the smartest people i 
have ever met, and I fear this statement =nbsp;will be controversial.is New Yorks Jeffrey Epstein, =oth he and I are 
very aware of his mistakes that now over a decade =ater still cause concern amongst some very accomplished people, 
=nbsp;but i am a firm believer that everyone, deserves a second =hance and then can be measured on the product of 
the work after asking =or forgiveness. that is a great part of what makes this =ountry strong. 
Jeffret is neither fluent in =panish, french or italian however he is highly conversant =nd 
multilingual in the areas of the most =nbsp;advanced sciences and finance.. He can exquisitely =nbsp;conduct a 
seminar in fields as diverse as evolutionary biology, =omputational neuro science.or even the highly esoteric 
=athematics that permeate our future. Mathematicans at Harvard marvel at =is breadth that spans the divide between 
the esoteric and the ye. ,as =ell as music as a lens into the brain. His interests are =nbsp;far ranging and unlike many 
that simply repeat back what they have =ead , he is creative and original in fields such ase , signal =ntelligence, power 
law distributions , and encryption. 
= am well aware that in his past he has made some awful decisions, and =m sure he would have done things differently 
if he had the =pportunity to do them over. however he has paid his debt to =ociety, asked his friends and family for 
forgiveness and has continued =is charitable work that he began even decades before his =ravails. 
i have had the privilege to =eet the worlds greatest minds, and i can easily say that Jeffrey = is amongst the best of 
those. 
I =ave utmost confidence in his integrity. I have dealt with him for = number of years on both sides of a negotiation and 
say with certainty =hat 1;d rather be on his side. 
He =as been in the Billionaire business for longer than almost anyone else. =nbsp;His insight into the unique problems of 
the super wealthy , has =een invaluable to many others that i know. He found a niche in the =arty 80s discerning the 
burdens of hyper wealth and from his time on =he board of Rockefeller or his time at the trilateral commission, 
=nbsp;the common refrain from those he has come in contact with Jeffrey =as made me think differently about. ....//. 
=/span> 
He has an extraordinary =bility with numbers, complex concepts. mixed with a =nbsp;sometimes brutal honesty, 
refreshing, a sense of humor =hat some find highly cultured others find just outright =illy, 
His homes are probably the best =ollection of real estate in the united states. A private island , =hat some describe as a 
tribute to megalomania. and a ranch in new =exico that is truly beyond imagination and my favorite townhouse in NY. 
=nbsp; His attention to detail is remarkable . I find =t sad that he doesn't have children of his own, but makes up for it 
by =aintaining close friendships that have lasted for =ecades. 
His chariblae instincts have =een honed over many years and his advice and judgment has been =nvaluable in several 
instances.
