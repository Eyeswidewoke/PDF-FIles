Section 6: Summary of Terms and Conditions 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV, LP 
further details. 
Co-investment 
The Manager may offer co-investment opportunities to any Limited Partner in its sole 
discretion 
Alternative Vehicles 
Parallel Funds 
Feeder Funds 
Side Letters 
The Manager will have the right in connection with any investment to direct the Advances of 
some or all of the Limited Partners to be made through one or more alternative investment 
vehicles (each, an "Alternative Vehicle' if. in the judgment of the Manager, the use of such 
vehicle or vehicles represents an appropriate structure for the Fund and would facilitate 
participation in certain types of investments. Any Altemathre Vehicle generally will be 
governed by terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the Fund (except as may 
be advisable because of such legal, regulatory or tax constraints) and will be managed by the 
General Partner, the Manager or an affiliate thereof The profits and losses of an Alternative 
Vehicle generally will be aggregated with those of the Fund for purposes of determining 
distributions by the Fund and such Alternative Vehicle, unless the General Partner or the 
Manager elects otherwise in its sole discretion based on a determination that such 
aggregation could increase the risk of any adverse tax or other consequences. 
The General Partner or the Manager may establish one or more parallel funds (each a 
'Parallel Fund") to accommodate the investment requirements of certain investors. My 
Parallel Fund documentation will contain terms and conditions substantially similar to those of 
the Fund and will be managed by the General Partner, the Manager or an affiliate thereof. 
Any Parallel Fund will be responsible for its pro rata share of expenses. 
The General Partner or the Manager may establish one or more feeder funds which will 
invest in the Fund or a Parallel Fund (each, a "Feeder Fund") to accommodate the 
investment requirements of certain investors. In certain respects, investors in a Feeder Fund 
will be treated as having invested directly in the Fund or the relevant Parallel Fund, as the 
case may be. 
The General Partner or the Manager, without any further act, approval or vote of any Partner, 
may enter into side letters or other written agreements with one or more Limited Partners 
which have the effect of establishing additional rights (including, for example. reducing the 
General Partner's Share chargeable with respect to such Limited Partner), or altering or 
supplementing the terms of the Fund Partnership Agreement (each, a 'Side Letter"). A Side 
Letter may include additional rights that are, or alter or supplement the terms of the Fund 
Partnership Agreement in a manner that is, more favorable to the recipient than those offered 
to any other Limited Partner, including with respect to (i) economic arrangements (including 
alternative fee or other compensation arrangements), (ii) opting out of particular investments. 
(iii) reporting obligations of the Fund. (iv) transfer to affiliates. (v) co-investment opportunities. 
(vi) withdrawal events. (vii) consent rights to certain Fund Partnership Agreement 
amendments, (viii) indemnification arrangements, (ix) dispute resolution processes, or (x) any 
other matters described therein. If a Side Letter is entered into entitling a Limited Partner to 
opt out of a particular investment or withdraw from the Fund, any election to opt out or 
withdraw by such Limited Partner may increase each other Limited Partner's pro rata interest 
in that particular investment (in the case of an opt-out) or all future investments (in the case of 
a withdrawal), which may have an adverse effect on such Limited Partner's investment 
results. 
Any additional rights established, or any terms of the Fund Partnership Agreement altered or 
supplemented, in a Side Letter with a Limited Partner will govern solely with respect to such 
Limited Partner (but not any of such Limited Partner's assignees or transferees unless so 
specified in such side letter or otherwise agreed by the Manager) notwithstanding any other 
provision of the Fund Partnership Agreement. My additional rights established, or any terms 
of the Fund Partnership Agreement altered or supplemented, in a Side Letter with a Limited 
Partner may generally be elected by any other Limited Partner having a Commitment equal to
