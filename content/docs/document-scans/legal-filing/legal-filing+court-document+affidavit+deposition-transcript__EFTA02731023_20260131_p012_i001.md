The Dechert report states that from 2013 through 2017, you were under the 
misconception that your payments to Epstein would be tax-deductible, based on advice from 
Epstein.09 During that same period, you paid Epstein $158 million. It appears that you 
determined at some point that such amounts were not tax-deductible, however, the Dechert 
report does not provide any details on when that determination was made, why you determined 
those payments were not tax-deductible, or how such payments were characterized for tax 
purposes. The Committee requested information and documents to determine how such 
deductions were treated on previously-filed tax returns or whether any payments to Epstein were 
characterized as gifts. 
As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee I have long been concerned that ultra-
high net worth individuals frequently employ sophisticated tax avoidance schemes to circumvent 
federal gift and estate tax laws. With the assistance of sophisticated advisors, the wealthiest one 
percent of Americans often exploit estate planning and loopholes in the tax code to avoid paying 
hundreds of millions, or billions, of dollars in gift and estate taxes. As a result, this select group 
of Americans is able to use trusts and other structures to transfer enormous untaxed sums of 
wealth to their children. 
I am also concerned that the decimation of IRS enforcement resources over the last 
decade has led to a decline in compliance with federal gift tax filing requirements. As IRS audits 
of gift tax returns have plummeted, the Committee's investigations have identified several 
instances where gifts far exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion may not have been properly 
reported on federal tax filings. 
The Committee is conducting several investigations into the means by which ultra-high 
net worth persons avoid or evade paying federal taxes, including gift taxes. These investigations 
will help inform legislation to address loopholes in the tax code. For example, the Committee has 
been investigating the growing use of Private Placement Life Insurance by the wealthiest 
Americans as a tax shelter to avoid paying billions of dollars in income, gift and estate taxes. The 
Committee's investigations into offshore tax evasion schemes involving individuals with dual 
citizenship have also uncovered other challenges related to the enforcement of gift tax laws. For 
example, the Committee's investigation into Credit Suisse identified several situations where 
expatriating from the United States was part of a strategy to evade gift taxes while concealing 
offshore accounts from the IRS. 
The facts and circumstances surrounding your business arrangement with Epstein present 
a variety of novel issues as they relate to circumventing gift and estate tax laws. Due to the 
limited information you have provided the Committee, a significant number of open questions 
remain regarding the tax avoidance scheme you implemented with Epstein's assistance, 
" For 2013 to 2017 the annual gift tax exclusion was $14,000 and the lifetime exclusion amount was approximately 
$5 million.

is what Epstein had told Black." )
