US Equity Insights 
10 EPS tracker: Good EPS beats, lots of sales misses; sales down 
y/y, but margin expansion helped EPS up y/y 
487 companies or 98% of S&P EPS reported. Wok beat on EPS with a wtd avg beat of 
6.2% (6.7% ex Fin), but only 32% beat on sales with a wtd avg miss of -1.0% (-1.4% ex 
Fin). The wtd avg EPS beat of 6.2% is better than normal, but the 8.2% cut to 10 EPS 
before reporting is also the biggest since recession. Btm-up IQ EPS is now S28.78, 
2.6% y/y. The 10 EPS growth is on -3.5% sales decline helped by 4.5% y/y margin 
expansion and 1.5% from share buybacks. 
Consensus 20 btm-up EPS is trimmed to $28.84 despite better than expected 10 
results. Even with normal 3% beat, 2Q EPS will be down slightly to flat from a year ago. 
Consensus 2015 btm-up EPS rose somewhat last week to $119.92, vs. $132 seen last 
September. It is still $1.92 higher than our $118 estimate. Our quarterly EPS estimates 
for 2015 are: $28, $29, $30, $31. Our 2015E S&P 500 EPS of $118 (flat y/y) assumes 
average 1.05 EUR/USD, 100 DXY, and -$50/bbl WTI in 2015. Spot DXY dollar index is 
at -95. if the dollar stays where it is now and oil $60-70/bbl, 2015 S&P EPS should be 
-$121 vs. our current estimate of $118. 
10 blended EPS y/y growth is 2.3% for S&P, 10.0% ex Energy, and 8.2% ex Energy and 
Financials. 10 EPS y/y growth is strongest at Health Care (18.0%), followed by 
Financials (16.7%), Tech (9.8%), Cons Disc (7.3%), and Industrials (5.6%). All other 
sectors have low single digit EPS growth or EPS decline. 
10 blended sales y/y growth is -3.5% for S&P, 2.0% ex Energy, and 1.9% ex Energy and 
Financials. Our two OW secular growth sectors Heath Care and Tech have the 
strongest sales y/y growth again, 10.5% at HC and 5.2% at Tech. All other sectors have 
low single digit sales growth or sales decline. 
10 blended net margin is 10.6%, 11.1% ex Energy, and 10.1% ex Energy and 
Financials. The y/y margin growth is 4.5%, 6.2%, and 4.7% respectively. Energy net 
margin fell less than feared. Most of other sectors had margin expansion from a year 
ago, led by Financials and Health Care.
