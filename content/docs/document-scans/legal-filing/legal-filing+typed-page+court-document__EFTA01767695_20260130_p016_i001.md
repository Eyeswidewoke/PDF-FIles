July 6, 2012 -- This week there were fresh strains in the relationship between the followers of Michel Aoun and 
Hezbollah, as Christian and Muslim parliamentarians split over a scheme to permanently hire Electricite du Liban 
contractual workers. The Aounists argue that the plan, devised by the parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, favors his Amal 
base, and accused <http://www.naharnetcomistoriesien/45419-suleiman-constitutional-council-to-decide-on-edl-
workers-employment-as-sharp-differences-loom> Hezbollah of doing nothing to neutralize the dispute. 
More interesting than that scrap over sectarian quotas was how the context affects Hezbollah. The party is 
already facing a Shia community in ebullition. Economic conditions are harder than ever; state services are in disarray; 
security in key Shia districts, including the southern suburbs and the Bekaa, has declined; and now, Hezbollah's ties with 
its Christian partners are under stress, even if this is unlikely to turn into a full-fledged rift Moreover, the party has 
failed to liberate Shia pilgrims abducted in Syria, despite early promises that they would be set free, and Shia have been 
expelled from Gulf states because they are associated with Hezbollah and Iran. 
This is not necessarily the beginning of the end for Hezbollah. But it could be the end of the beginning—of that 
phase when Hezbollah's supporters imagined the party was incapable of doing wrong. Hezbollah dominates the 
government and most of the security bodies, and has great sway over the army. It has chased its main rival, Saad Hariri, 
out of the country, replacing him with a prime minister of its choice. And yet what does Hezbollah have to show for all 
that authority? A Lebanese state that has never seemed so dysfunctional. 
Meanwhile, the party's principal Arab ally, Syria, is going through a savage conflict that will, in all likelihood, 
eventually lead to the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad's regime. Hezbollah has not only morally supported Assad against 
his own people; it stands accused of actively participating in the repression. This poses problems for a party that claims 
to speak on behalf of the deprived, and whose legitimacy was built on what it described as resistance to Israeli 
oppression. 
How does all this affect Hezbollah's strategic objectives, above all its ability to act as Iran's vanguard in the 
Levant? The party has continued to underline in one way or another that its fighting capacity, like its deterrence 
capability, is undiminished. No one doubts that Hezbollah has the weapons to retaliate against Israel if necessary—for 
instance if Tehran requests this of the party following an Israeli attack against Iranian nuclear facilities. 
However, less clear is whether Hezbollah has both the political and logistical props in Lebanese society that 
would be needed to pursue a confrontation with Israel. War is not just about weaponry; it involves myriad intangibles 
that Hezbollah would need to secure before carrying Lebanon into what is bound to be a devastating altercation, one far 
worse than what we experienced in summer 2006. 
And here, the picture is very hazy indeed. An Assad regime under duress might yet be able to send arms to 
Hezbollah in the midst of a battle with Israel. Indeed, it could be tempted to send what is most destructive in Syria's 
arsenal, even chemical weapons, though what Hezbollah would choose to do with such material is a different matter. 
But what of Shia morale and Lebanese national solidarity behind Hezbollah, essential ingredients in defining the 
latitude the party has to engage in a war, sustain it and even escalate if necessary? On both levels Hezbollah is facing 
serious problems. For a start, the party would have to ensure that a war looks like self-defense, which is no easy task. 
Lebanon's Shia will back Hezbollah against patent Israeli aggression, but it is much more questionable whether they 
would do so on behalf of Iran, in defense of its nuclear program. 
That said, the Shia community, given the uncertainty it is facing, does not relish the prospect of war under any 
circumstances. The Shia have too often suffered, too often served as cannon fodder, to readily allow Hezbollah to put 
them through the ringer once again. Nor will there be anywhere near the same amounts of money available for 
reconstruction after a forthcoming war (if one takes place) as there was six years ago. Unless destroyed Shia towns and 
villages are rebuilt quickly, Hezbollah's standing could suffer in a decisive way. 
As for national solidarity, Hezbollah can dream on. A majority of Sunnis, even those bitterly hostile to Israel, 
loathes the party. The Druze, who would absorb the first wave of Shia refugees, cannot forget how Hezbollah attacked 
their mountains in May 2008. 
As for the Christians, the purported camaraderie between the Aounists and Hezbollah is not what it was, and 
the disagreement over the EDI contract workers highlighted this. Ironically, collaboration in the government has put a 
distance between the two sides, with the Aounists and Hezbollah pursuing incompatible objectives. Nor were the ties 
ever strong on the ground in the first place, despite efforts by naive observers to read into the rapport something 
intense and novel.
