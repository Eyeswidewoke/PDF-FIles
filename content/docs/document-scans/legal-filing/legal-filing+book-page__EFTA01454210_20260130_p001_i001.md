to the impact of potentially higher income taxes on 
their giving goals. Over about 15 years, the same chari-
table gift could be halved if it's subject to income taxes 
I lowever, few are willing to make an absolute transfer to 
charity (or a charitable remainder trust) today to reduce 
that burden. The solution could be a PPVA. 
PPVAs allow charitably inclined individuals to main-
tain full ownership and broader investment options for 
earmarked assets throughout their lifetime, while defer-
ring the income taxation of investment gains on those 
assets. A client can make deposits or take withdrawals 
(for personal consumption or charitable gifting), adjust 
the asset allocation and/or change the beneficiary desig-
nation at any time. 
The net result, if the PPVA investment account 
is left to charities or foundations, is that all the 
assets pass undiminished by income and estate taxes. 
"Optimizing Charitable Gifts,* this page, shows the 
values passing to charity for an initial allocation of 
55 million in a PPVA versus a taxable account. 
Simply by changing the location of the assets from a 
taxable account to a PPVA investment account, the 
family can multiply their potential charitable legacy 
assets (or substantially reduce the wealth needed to 
fund a specific large gift). In addition, many public 
charities give donor recognition credit for PPVA 
investment account beneficiary designations, which 
arc fully revocable if the account owner is at least 
65 years old. 
Practice tip: Name the charity as the primary ben-
eficiary of the PPVA investment account, or, if the client 
hasn't completely committed to leaving the PPVA to the 
charity, consider naming the charity as the contingent 
beneficiary of the PPVA. This could allow any of the 
primary beneficiaries (for example, a surviving spouse 
or children) to disclaim any part of the PPVA investment 
account assets to charity. 
U.S. Clients Residing Abroad 
Many advisors with U.S. clients living abroad are strug-
gling with the complications of how best to structure 
those clients' investments. Those clients typically can't 
access US. onshore investments, because they reside 
abroad. Offshore investments, while readily available, 
don't provide the necessary U.S. reporting and might

not be efficient for local tax purposes. If that weren't 
bad enough, new MICA and other requirements for 
US. persons with investments abroad make this process 
more complicated.' 
A PPVA investment account, properly structured, 
could access US. onshore investments and hold them 
without current U.S. taxation. In many places around the 
world, the PPVA itself could completely defer taxation 
on the investment portfolio while the individual resides 
in that country. And, distributions could be deferred 
until the client returns to the United States, making taxa-
tion simpler. But, perhaps most important, the PPVA 
investment account could hold offshore investments 
and should be exempt from foreign financial institution 
reporting requirements. 
Practice tip: The PPVA investment account also can 
operate effectively for a non-US. person planning to 
reside temporarily in the United States. Offshore invest-
ments could be held while the client is a U.S. resident
