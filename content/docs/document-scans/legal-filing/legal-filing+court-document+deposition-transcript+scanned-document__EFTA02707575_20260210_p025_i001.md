The CMBS loan also contains customary covenants that restrict KC Propco's ability to, among other 
things, engage in any other business other than the ownership, operation, and maintenance of the CMBS 
properties, acquire or own any other assets, merge into or consolidate with another entity or change its 
legal structure, own or invest in any subsidiary, commingle its assets, incur any additional debt, enter 
into any contract or agreement with any principal, assume or guarantee any debts, make any loans or 
advances, acquire obligations or securities, and make changes to name, identity, or structure. 
Furthermore, the CMBS loan agreement includes a provision that requires KUEH to provide to the 
lender a consolidated financial statements for the trailing 12 months to determine compliance with 
minimum thresholds of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), which, 
if not maintained, could result in a sweep of 50% or 100% of excess cash flow, depending upon the 
amount of the shortfall. Any funds swept pursuant to these provisions would be held by the lender in a 
cash management account owned by KC Propco as additional loan collateral and would be available for 
distribution upon the lender determining that for the immediately preceding 12-month period, the 
EBITDA for KUEH was equal to or greater than $108 million at the end of two consecutive calendar 
quarters. KC Propco was in compliance with the covenants of the CMBS loan as of December 31, 2011. 
The calculation of consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2012, did not 
meet the threshold. In accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, effective in May 2012, 50% of 
KC Propco's future Excess Cash Flow will be swept into a cash management account. 
For the CMBS loan, management's estimate of fair value is based on available information and was

$507.0 million to 3510.9 million, as compared to its carrying value of $604.8 million, as of 
December 31, 2011, and in the range of $548.6 million to $559.0 million, as compared to its carrying 
value of $616.5 million, as of December 31, 2010.
