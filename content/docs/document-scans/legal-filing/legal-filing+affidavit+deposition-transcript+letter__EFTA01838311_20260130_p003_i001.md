because of the vast gulf in interests and intellect. Epstein is not interested in golf. The Coney 
Island-born son of a New York park attendant, he began his career as a teacher of physics and 
calculus, later putting his remarkable mathematical abilities to more profitable use as a financial 
trader and adviser. 
Asa billionaire he retained a consuming fascination with science, being a member of the New 
York Academy of Sciences and a visiting fellow at Harvard: his biggest charitable donations are in 
the fields of particle physics and artificial intelligence. 
On the one occasion I had a conversation with him, it was about the development of chess 
computers and how they could be made to simulate human methods of calculation; it soon 
became embarrassingly dear that I could not grasp a fraction of what he understood. M I said, it 
was impossible to see what he had in common, intellectually at least, with the Duke of York. On 
the other hand, the notionally republican Americans have a perennial obsession with the British 
royal family — the impending wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton seems almost 
bigger news there than here — and I suspect Epstein, an avid collector of objects and people, 
wanted to add a part of the House of Windsor to his fabulously expensive portfolio of exotica. 
Unfortunately, Andrew, trade ambassador or not, seems blithely unaware of when he is being 
bought: it was this newspaper that revealed he had accepted an offer of £15m for his former 
Sunninghill home — £3m over the already ludicrous asking price — from a Kazakh oil and gas 
billionaire purporting to be "a friend". This is a classic case of the "unsolicited gift", given in the 
hope of a later return of a favour. His negotiation last year of a $24,500 (£15,000) loan from 
Epstein to help pay down his ex-wife's wearyingly habitual debts is on a very different scale; but, 
to put it at its most cynical, why risk the scandal this would cause for such a trivial sum? 
Doubtless, Andrew would argue that Epstein was a genuine friend, and one who had served the 
prison sentence for his crime; certainly his loyalty, however naive or ill considered for a 
representative of the crown, is morally preferable to Sarah Ferguson's emetic effusion: "I 
personally, on behalf of myself, deeply regret that Jeffrey Epstein became involved in any way 
with me. I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children ... whenever I can, I will repay the 
money and will have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again." Bear in mind that she 
knew of Epstein's record when she asked her former husband to negotiate the loan, and you 
realise what self-serving, hysterical drivel this is. 
Yet the week's prize for hypocritical conduct in this most competitive field must surely be 
awarded to Chris Bryant, the former Foreign Office minister, who argued that Prince Andrew's 
indiscretions over Epstein and the sale of his home were so ill befitting a person in his position 
that he should be given "the honourable order of the boot". This from an MP who posed in his 
underpants on a website, advertising his desire for a "good, long f""•", who was a serial "flipper 
of his second, "parliamentary" home to claim additional expenses and who in 2004 submitted a 
demand so exorbitant that even the dozy and emollient House of Commons fees office disallowed 
it. 
Prince Andrew has been damned for his choice of friends, but he is blessed in his enemies.
