No more talk about media, no more talk of the senses, of perception, etc. Such considerations are presented within a 
conceptual framework that does not allow us to account for contemporary experience. Be concerned with activity integrated 
on the neural level. It is a process. aceThe only unit of currency in the process is the neural impulse or permeability wavelt26
In studying the transmission pattern of these waves we learn that ficeeach local area of the cortex interprets the message 
according to its local pattern of response. Nothing in the message itself can indicate its source of origin.ft21 On the integrative 
neural level there are no visual images, no sounds, no taste, no physical feeling, no odor. aeelt matters nothing whether these 
trains of neural impulse arise in the car, the eye, or any other sense organ; they arc all the same, they have no more 
individuality than the elemental dots and dashes of the telegraph code. There is no more of a sound or sight or pain in a nerve 
impulse during transmission than there is love or grief in the underground lines of the telegraph.P 
ficeThe qualities of a neural impulse bear no relation to the sensory stimulus which sends them on their way. Only the quantity 
or frequency varies.a' Forget about signal source; forget about sensory source. The eyes see nothing; the ears hear nothing. 
Our sensory receptors are capable of transmitting neural impulses that are variable only in two waysfratnamely, the diameter 
of the conducting fiber and the strength of the sensory stimulus. The former determines the speed of travel; the latter, the 
frequency, or distance between members of the procession.a — The eyes see nothing; the ears hear nothing. Give credit to the 
brain, where there are no pictures, no sounds. There are only electrical neural impulses. keit is these purely physical 
phenomena, whose qualities are fully prescribed by certain numerical data and determined by the semipermanent structures of 
the anatomy, which constitute the unit of currency in the nervous system. There is no other form of activity of nerve, no other 
physical movement in the tissues of the brain, out of which the processes of thought may be constructed:am 
The brain is the organizer. Seeing, hearing, perceptiona"all take place in the brain. The brain, which sees nothing, hears 
nothing, knows nothing. Each of the sensory receptors has a reception area in the cortex where neural impulses are received 
and acted upon in terms of a local pattern of response. acelf an operation could be devised to change the pathway of the optic 
nerves so that they delivered their messages to the auditory reception areas of the cortex, and to divert the auditory nerves to 
the visual area, the patient would hear noises when the lights were turned up, and see patterns and colors when the bell was 
rung.ii32
iiceThe mechanism whereby a sensory receptor which has important information to convey can transmit this information to 
the cortex of the brain, along a neural axone which is as featureless as a telegraph wire, has interesting properties of a 
quantitative nature. Two methods are available whereby the stark yes or-no, which is all that the nerve can carry, may be 
elaborated into the wealth of sensory detail which actually reaches the brain. One method is to vary the number of nerve fibers 
engaged in the work of transmission: twenty fibers will convey a message more efficiently than ten fibers. The other method is 
by modulation of the frequency of the impulses as they follow each other along the single track.a" It becomes a question of 
frequencies, or numbers. 
Man created a dehumanized, computerized world, a world in which he was nothing more than a number. But it was really the 
other way around: numbers representing neural patterns had somehow become humanized. From an unambiguous and 
objective representation of patterns of activity, the number became transformed into iicemana and scent manit This arbitrary 
object-subject separation assured ambiguity, vagueness, and illusion. 
How does the picture get put together? It doesnamt. All that is happening are volleys of neural impulses. What is the point of 
attempting to correlate patterns of neural activity to mind, feelings, emotions, etc.? Dispense with these abstractions. They are 
from another epoch. They are of little usefulness in dealing with operant phenomena.
