S-I/A 
Marketing services 
We also use the insights derived from our payments and POS services to develop unique marketing services that help 
our sellers reach customers and increase sales. Square Customer Engagement helps sellers understand their businesses, 
engage customers in ongoing conversations, and promote their offerings through email marketing. The result is a personalized 
and improved shopping experience for buyers that helps drive growth for sellers. By linking buyer payment cards and 
information to marketing efforts conducted in our ecosystem, we have created a closed loop that allows sellers to easily assess 
the return on their marketing efforts—a difficult feat in the offline world. 
Mobile device proliferation has also enabled delivery-as-a-service. Caviar, our food delivery offering, helps restaurants 
reach customers and increase sales without having to create and manage their own delivery logistics. By providing delivery 
services for them. Caviar makes it easy for restaurants to expand their reach with little additional overhead. Buyers can access 
Caviar through our iOS and Android mobile apps or through our Caviar website. 
Our Strengths 
• We create technology to transform commerce. 
We invest significantly in hardware and software design and 
engineering to rapidly deploy product updates to sellers and buyers. At the end of 2014, over 45% of our employees 
served in product engineering, development, and design functions. 
• We have tremendous scale. 
Our millions of sellers provide a sizable opportunity for up-selling and cross-selling our 
products and services. Our scale also enables us to establish favorable partnerships with financial institutions to 
provide attractive pricing for our sellers. 
• We have a strong brand. 
We estimate that, to date, nearly half of our sellers have found us and signed up, rather 
than us having found them. This is the result of building services that deliver value and that sellers eagerly 
recommend. 
We have a deep understanding of our sellers. 
Payments and POS activity in our ecosystem allows us to create 
products and services that address many of the functions our sellers need to operate and grow their businesses.

• We use a differentiated approach to risk management. 
Our risk management approach starts with trusting sellers. 
We remove the friction of signing up. then use technology to quickly detect and eliminate risky and fraudulent activity. 
Since inception, we have ceased providing services to fewer than 5% of sellers due to suspected or confirmed 
fraudulent behavior, their exceeding our risk parameters, their violation of our terms of service, or other concerns. Our 
risk and fraud losses accounted for approximately 0.1% of GPV in the 12 months ended September 30, 2015. 
• We have a persistent communication channel with our sellers. 
Our direct, ongoing interactions with our sellers help 
us to tailor offerings directly to them, at scale and in the context of their usage. For example, when a seller accesses 
their Square Dashboard—a centralized hub from where they can view and manage daily business operations—we can 
automatically send a notification to prompt the seller to sign up for Square Customer Engagement and take action on 
what they learned. On average, nearly 70% of sellers who process more than $125,000 per year engage daily with 
analytics in their Square Dashboard. 
We have a large and growing buyer network. 
We have a direct relationship with buyers through various touch points 
in our ecosystem. In the 12 months ended September 30, 2015, our sellers accepted payments from approximately 
180 million payment cards, which we estimate represents approximately one in four active payment cards in circulation 
in the United States, based on data from The Nilson Report published in February 2015. Our relationship with buyers 
strengthens our ecosystem and many of our services, including Square Customer Engagement, Square Cash, and 
Caviar.
