Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz=writes: "We did not have confidence that Strzok's decision t= prioritize the Russia 
investigation over following up on Ethel investigati=e lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias."<=> 
Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI D=rector James Comey was 
trying to influence the election, Mr. Comey did make=decisions based on political considerations. He told the inspector 
general that his election-eve decision to reopen the C=inton email investigation was motivated by a desire to protect her 
assumed p=esidency's legitimacy. 
The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text message= "created the appearance that 
investigative decisions were impacted=by bias or improper considerations." The report adds, importantly, that "most of 
the text messages raising such questions pertained to=the Russia investigation." Given how biases ineluctably shape 
behav=or, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton in=estigation and building a narrative of 
Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials sought to bolster Mrs. Clintont=804es electoral chances and, if 
the unthinkable happened, obtain an insura=ce policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of 
illegitim=cy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in M=y 2017 after President 
Trump fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general conclud=s that the pervasive bias "cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned,"=including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was politically motivated, 
then its c=lmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All s=ecial-counsel activities—
investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and convictions—are fru=t of a poisonous tree, byproducts of 
a violation of due process. That Mr. M=eller and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin offer= no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or property= it is required to use 
fundamentally fair processes. The Supreme Court has m=de clear that when governmental action "shocks the 
conscience," it violates due process. Such cond=ct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that appear, under the 
t=tality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entrapm=nt. 
In U.S. v. Russell (19=3), the justices observed: "We may someday be presented with a situation 
in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous=that due process principles would absolutely bar the 
government from invoki=g judicial processes to obtain a conviction." It didn't tak= long. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), 
the court concluded that due process was o=fended by a prosecutor's "realistic likelihood of '=indictiveness " that 
tainted the "very initia=ion of proceedings." 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton =/span>(1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have 
"power to employ the full machinery of the state in scrutinizi=g any given individual ... we must have assurance that 
those who would wi=ld this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibility=for the attainment of 
justice." Prosecutors must be "disinterested" and make "dispassionate ass=ssments," free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania=nbsp;(2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias 
violated due process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earlie=, in prosecuting the death-row inmate 
whose habeas corpus petition he was h=aring. The passage of time and involvement of others do not vitiate the tai=t but 
heighten "the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might otherwise be ob=cured," the justices 
wrote. A single biased individual "mig=t still have an influence that, while not so visible ... is nev=rtheless significant." 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the i=spector general, there is a 
strong circumstantial case—including pe=sonnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire was 
initiated for political, not national-security, purposes.<=u> 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department p=esumption against 
investigating campaigns in an election year. And while im=artiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-Attorney 
General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is 40=9Cparticularly important in an election year," and "politic= must
