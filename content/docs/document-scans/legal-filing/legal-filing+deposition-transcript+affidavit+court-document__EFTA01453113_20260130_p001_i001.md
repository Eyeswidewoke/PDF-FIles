SELECT AND INITIAL THE APPLICABLE BOX FOR LIMITED OR FULL TRADING AUTHORIZATION 
LIMITED TRADING AUTHORIZATION 
DBSI is authorized to follow the instructions of Agent(s) in every respect concerning 
the Account(s), and Agent(s) is/are authorized to act for the Undersigned and on the 
Undersigned's behalf to buy, sell or enter into trades of stocks, bonds, option contracts, or 
any other securities, or contracts relating to same on margin or otherwise, as well as with 
respect to all other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such 
purchases, sales or other trading activity. 
Note: Limited Authorization does not permit Agent(s) to withdraw or transfer assets from 
the Account(s). 
—OR—
FULL AUTHORIZATION TO TRADE AND MOVE ASSETS 
DBSI is authorized to follow the instructions of Agent(s) in every respect concerning the 
Account(s), and to make deliveries or transfers of assets (including cash), from the 
Account(s) and payment of moneys as directed by Agent(s), without restriction 
(including to the Agent(s), himself, herself or themselves except in connection with IRAs). 
Note: This Full Authorization grants Agent(s) unrestricted authority to trade in the 
Account(s) and to withdraw or transfer assets from the Account(s). 
For IRAs, Agent is authorized to elect whether to make tax withholding elections in connection 
with distributions. 
In all matters and things mentioned above, as well as in all other things necessary or incidental to the 
furtherance or conduct of the Account(s), Agent(s) may act in the same manner and with the same 
force and effect as the Undersigned might or could do. 
This Authorization/Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until DBSI receives actual written notice signed by 
the Undersigned of its revocation to be delivered to the Undersigned's DBSI Client Advisor or his or her branch manager. 
However, the limited power of attorney granted hereunder is not a durable power of attorney and will cease to be effective 
upon actual receipt by DBSI of written notice of the occurrence of either of the following events: (a) the Undersigned is 
judicially declared to be incompetent, or (b) the death of the Undersigned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Undersigned 
acknowledges that DBSI shall be entitled to continue to rely upon this Authorization/Power of Attorney until such time as 
DBSI receives such actual written notice. 
The Undersigned understands and agrees that DBSI has the right to require additional verification and documentation from 
the Undersigned or the Undersigned's Agent(s) in certain transactions that DBSI, in its sole discretion, deems necessary. In 
addition, DBSI has the right to request that either a new Authorization/Power of Attorney be executed or that the Agent(s) 
verify in writing the validity of the current Authorization/Power of Attorney.
