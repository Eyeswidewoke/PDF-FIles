2006 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 1044, 
On August 23, 2005, the claimant underwent an independent medical examination by 
Dr. Mark A. Ross, physiatrist. He informed Dr. Ross about the accident, his treatment, and 
that he had not improved since the injury. The claimant complained of suffering constant 
pain, ranging from a level six to ten, humming in his head, dizziness, imbalance, and 
difficulty walking, standing, lifting, bending, and concentrating. ["8JHe advised Dr. Ross 
that he could not work, because he frequently had to lie down. The doctor interviewed the 
claimant, reviewed his diagnostic studies, and read his medical records. 
Dr. Ross concluded that the claimant had no diagnoses resulting from the work-related 
accident, and that: "There are continued pain complaints but there is no supportable 
medical basis for the diagnosis of a physical injury." Dr. Ross dismissed the claimant's 
subjective complaints as unreliable and not supported by objective findings. He similarly 
opined that much medical treatment had been excessive and unnecessary as responsive 
to the unsubstantiated subjective complaints. Dr. Ross stated that ongoing treatment was 
not required, since the claimant's complaints and physical examination findings were not 
credible. The doctor concluded that he could return to full, unrestricted duty and that no 
medical evidence supported restrictions. Dr. Ross suggested that the claimant likely had a 
psychological/behavioral component to explain his ongoing alleged symptoms. The doctor 
recommended evaluation for a mild traumatic brain injury, since this might be "the only 
alternate explanation" for his "relentless pursuit [' 9] of physical remedy" for his 
"nonexistent physical problems." Dr. Ross immediately issued a revision to clarify that his 
report of August 23, 2005, contained a typographical error, and should convey that he "did 
not see" the claimant's subjective complaints. 
By letter dated October 14, 2005, Dr. Holzer restated the claimant's history and his 
original treatment of him. He noted that he had reviewed Dr. Ross' evaluation and some 
reports from other treating physicians, such as Dr. Goss. Dr. Holzer maintained his opinion 
that as a result of the industrial accident, the claimant suffered cervical and lumbar 
myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome, post-traumatic syndrome secondary to his head 
trauma, and depression. The doctor assessed, with a reasonable degree of medical 
certainty, that the work-related injuries were causally related to his current problems and 
total disability. Dr. Holzer emphasized that the claimant had demonstrated objective 
findings on examination and diagnostic studies. The doctor acknowledged that he had 
preexisting degenerative disease in his cervical area. However, Dr. Holzer stressed that 
before the accident, the claimant was asymptomatic and capable of working. No] The 
doctor maintained, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that: "The claimant 
remains disabled totally from his work, as a direct result of the injury in question and due to 
the above diagnoses, which are clearly related to his injury." 
Dr. Scott W. Sautter, neurospsychologist, evaluated the claimant on December 7, 
2005, to assess whether he suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or psychogenic 
component to his report of symptoms. Dr. Sautter concluded that the test data revealed 
poor testing, and that "his performance of slightly better than chance is atypical," which 
suggested poor effort or exaggeration of symptoms. The doctor opined that the evaluation 
was invalid, and not a representation of the claimant's true abilities, and that his 
personality assessment suggested somatization. Dr. Sautter diagnosed: (1) a probable 
cognitive disorder, most likely secondary to his mood disorder and complaints of chronic 
pain; (2) major depression; (3) tendency to somatosize symptoms; and (4) complaints of
