There were just 97 violent crimes committed per 100,000 people in Sunnyvale, the 10th lowest r=te among large U.S. 
cities, and considerably lower than the national rate of 3=8 per 100,000 people. Robberies and aggravated assaults 
accounted for the bul= of the city's violent crimes, and there were just four documented murd=r cases last year. Like in 
other large cities, safety is often accompanied by finan=ial well-being. A typical household in Sunnyvale earned nearly 
$99,000 last yea=, more than in all but four other large cities. Sunnyvale residents were also among the least likely to 
live in poverty, with a poverty rate of just 7.3%= As is common among wealthier populations, Sunnyvale adults are well-
educated. Nearly 60% of adults 25 and older had at least a bachelor's degree =s of last year, one of the highest 
attainment rates nationwide.

Glendale is a suburb of Los Angeles and one of the safest cities in both California and the nati=n. Last year, just one 
murder was recorded in the city. Additionally, there we=e just 97 incidents of aggravated assault, or about 50 per 
100,000 residents,=which was one of the lowest rates in the United States. By comparison, nationwide there were more 
than four times the number of assaults for every 100,000 people. Also impressive, Glendale has been able to keep crime 
rates low des=ite lacking as wealthy residents as in many other extremely safe cities. The me=ian household income in 
Glendale last year was $50,172, lower than the national median of $52,250. 
8. Amherst, New Yorkaspan> 
> Violent crimes per 100,000:90 
> Population: 118,296 
> 2013 murders: 1 (tied-9th lowest) 
> Poverty rate: N/A 
> Pct. of adults with high school degree: N/A 
After falling between 2010 and 2012, the violent crime rate in Amherst increased in 2013 4r=94 from 75 reported 
incidents per 100,000 residents in 2012 to 90 per 100,000 resident= last year. This was the exception among the safest 
U.S. cities, all of whic= reported declining crime rates in 2013. Despite the increase, the city, located just outside of 
Buffalo, is still quite safe. There was only one murder recorded=in Amherst last year, and property crimes were also very 
rare. There were 27 m=tor vehicle thefts per 100,000 people in Amherst last year, lower than in every city except for 
Naperville, Illinois. Burglary was also extremely uncommon =n the area. Just 172 burglaries were reported per 100,000 
residents last year= the fourth lowest rate among large U.S. cities and substantially lower than=the national rate of 610 
burglaries per 100,000 Americans. 
7. Gilbert, Arizona 
> Violent crimes per 100,000:86 
> Population: 225,232 
> 2013 murders: 1 (tied-19th lowest) 
> Poverty rate: 5.9% (5th lowest) 
> Pct. of adults with high school degree: 94.1% (22nd highest) 
Less than 6% of Gilbert residents lived in poverty last year, nearly the lowest rate in the nation, and likely a major factor 
in the region's low crime rate. T=ere was just one murder reported in Gilbert last year, and only 21 robberies per 
100,000 residents, a fraction of the national robbery rate of 109 per 100,0=0 people. Gilbert's stellar crime record may 
be a relatively isolated=phenomenon, as surrounding areas reported far higher levels of violent crime. Nearby Phoenix, 
for example, reported a violent crime rate well above the national rate.
