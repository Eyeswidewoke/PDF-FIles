Mr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn =99t expected to finish for 
months. But the current report reveals that FBI=officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald 
Trump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who le= both the Clinton and Trump investigations, confidently 
assuaged a colleag=e's fear that Mr. Trump would become president: "No he won=E2 t. We'll stop it." An unnamed FBI 
lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was "devastated" and =80 numb" after Mr. Trump won, while declaring 
to another FBI att=rney: "Viva le resistance." 
The report highlights the FBI's failure to act promptly =pon discovering that Anthony 
Weiner's laptop contained thousands o= Mrs. Clinton's emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the "higher 
priority" of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowit= writes: "We did not have confidence that Strzok's decisio= to prioritize the 
Russia investigation over following up on [the] investi=ative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from 
bias."=/u> 
Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI=Director James 
Comey was trying to influence the election, Mr. Comey did m=ke decisions based on political considerations. He told the 
inspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the=Clinton email investigation was motivated by a desire to 
protect her assum=d presidency's legitimacy. 
The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text messa=es "created the appearance 
that investigative decisions were impac=ed by bias or improper considerations." The report adds, important=y, that 
"most of the text messages raising such questions pertained t= the Russia investigation." Given how biases ineluctably 
shape beh=vior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton=investigation and building a 
narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton=E2 s electoral 
chances and, if the unthinkable happened, obtain an in=urance policy to cripple the Trump administration with 
accusations of ille=itimacy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in=May 2017 after 
President Trump fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general conc=udes that the pervasive bias "cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned, =9D including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was politically 
motivated, then i=s culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. =11 special-counsel activities—
investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and convictions—are fr=it of a poisonous tree, byproducts of 
a violation of due process. That Mr.=Mueller and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin of=ers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or proper=y, it is required to use 
fundamentally fair processes. The Supreme Court h=s made clear that when governmental action "shocks the 
conscience," it violates due process. Such con=uct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that appear, under 
the=totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entr=pment. 
In U.S. v. Russell =1973), the justices observed: "We may someday be presented with a 
situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageou= that due process principles would absolutely 
bar the government from invo=ing judicial processes to obtain a conviction." It didn't =ake long. In Blackledge v. Perry 
(1974), the court concluded that due process was =ffended by a prosecutor's "realistic likelihood of =98vindictiveness' " 
that tainted the "very in=tiation of proceedings." 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton =A0(1987), the justices held that because prosecutors 
have "power to employ the full machinery of the state in scrutiniz=ng any given individual... we must have assurance 
that those who would =ield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibil=ty for the attainment of 
justice." Prosecutors must be "disinterested" and make "dispassionate as=essments," free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania<=i> (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias 
violated due process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earli=r, in prosecuting the death-row inmate 
whose habeas corpus petition he was=hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not vitiate the =aint
