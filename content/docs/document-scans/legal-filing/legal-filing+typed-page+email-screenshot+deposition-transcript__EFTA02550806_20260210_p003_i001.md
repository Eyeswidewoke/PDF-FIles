Please take the following in the spirit in which it is meant 
<=r>With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his total and utter incompetence 
was brought clearly, front and center. He may be a step up from Eileen= but, if he is, then it is certainly not by 
much,Q=A0 A major difference is that Eileen knew she was over =er head. Brad struts his stupiditly whenever he gets a 
chance= The list of things that were done and not done he refused to let be=prepared as it will exemplify the 
outrageious lack of progres= and prioirties 
A critical=example. - Though you and I have spent many many hours di=cussing the importance of attentive care 
and attention to =etails and mechanics. with regard Phaidon = was not shown one single document , not one.!! Brad 
wanted to=keep it private between he, and his so called " advisors " however as he was out of the off=ce during the 
most important transaction of the year, I did get torC240 spend time with joslin Joe and john,=C2* - the situation in 
your office is totally ludicrous - =C2* to summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - of things I thought 
were a priority to get donet=A0 - still remains in the whole unresolved. Neith=r Alan nor Brad has reviewed the BRH 
agreemennt =r the TRA , the two largest financial assets of your portfolio, inexcusable . 
The IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperat= need of a new system - reporting badly flawed , and both 
cumb=rsome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off exercises , when e=ther you or brad ask for it - airplane: re 
structure, (my only sugg=sted priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead then it was then , consultants up the kazoo but 
nothing at all done=( the office was recently told by Brad not to share the outsid= proposals with me - brad has no idea 
even as to what q=estions to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost =veryone in the office. . Eileen 
was self aware enough to=know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad in=o is rampant a simple 
emblematic example- 3 million in d=ductions =span>I'm told wer=/span>e taken for art space but on closer 
examination it=turns out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you wi=l be told yes they were deducted 
on the return they said that is the=only real question you were focused on ! " were the= deducted or not - correct 
question would have been " is there = benefit " !! I asked for the balance sheet and/or=C2* P and L for Regan arts , 
the basic first step in ord=r to check your financials. "sorry we never got one?",=A0 though 9.8 million invested, no 
p&I, nothing!, a const=uction project run amok , no budget, the coo fired after only = months. , no clue . fyi 
artspace<=span> financials are also a total mess. (=no receivables ??). when i asked for a list of what got done and did 
not,=C24 i received the email from Brad basicailly rwrnd you own business. so much was promised. !!! 
=br> As in your words im one of your closest =riends and in order to turn the page. I include the following =n order 
to be constructive 
Here is a list o= things I think would be in your interest to get done a=ap .but definitely not by me . 
i suggest you for= new grats. , hire a high=level tax partner. use your trading accounts as th=y remain a paramount 
requirement 16 months after i emailed you =re their importance. THe Phaid=n transaction papered and structured as 
contemplated D=ES NOT WORK , its as simple as that. DOES NOT !! 
= suggest again that you re-do bank loans. no 
need to pa= interest at higher rates on boat or plane.. as Richard is now no l=nger trustee. re- do will, make suydam 
executor, with Barry, and john as b=ck up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid o= Ju=y Black trust, deal with 
gifts and their tax returns,=. review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more protections in for =span>Alex and Victoria. , 
distribute =some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art divis=on with children in attendance . have fire 
drill done on estat=. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said =he only 
1040 he ever filled out was his own. Hal=erin has a conflict that should be addr=ssed., A strategy of the use of art 
should be implemented.. you hav= tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consult=nt.. boat consultants. 
architects, lighting , art, Iega=, . foundation , deal with TRA</rpan> , BRH , rationalize investrents. cash flow. 
reporting, gaming disclosures. foreign, gift.. pre=are tax projections for 15 and 16, . deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, deb= 
financed. art partnership, pledges. sell stock , art, deal wi=h <=pan>phaidon debt. athene=/span>,? income , capital , 
foreign , exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound issues, basis, appropriat= discount rates. ? terminations. 
control. , qualified dividends.Q=A0 corporate tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, 
I st=II think you might consider a Rothshcild ban= transaction they have 150 b and a distribution network=with no 
products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial se=vice. deal with UK visa issue sooner rather than later. we 
can talk =bout Rowen request re Athene , complex 2 billion in taxes.>=A0 on transaction. ?!
