Agreement such Beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me. 
Section 8.3. - Law Governing 
This Agreement and each trust created by it shall in all respects and for all purposes be 
governed and regulated by the laws of the Territory of the United States Virgin Islands, as they 
now exist and may from time to time be enacted, amended, or repealed. All questions regarding 
the validity, construction and administration of this Agreement, or any of its provisions, and of 
any trust created by it shall be determined solely by the laws of that Territory. The courts of the 
State of Delaware and the U.S. Virgin Islands shall have primary supervision over the 
administration of each trust created by this Agreement. It is intended that each such trust shall 
be a U.S. domestic trust as defined in Title 26 section 7701(a)(30) of the Code by virtue of 
meeting the court and control test. As provided in Treas. Reg. section 301.7701-7(c)(4)(D), 
if both a United States court and a foreign court are able to exercise primary supervision over 
the administration of the trust, the trust meets the court test. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Trustees of each trust 
created under this Agreement have discretion at any time or times following my death to transfer 
the situs of such trust to such other country, or such other jurisdiction as the Trustees determine, 
without obtaining judicial authorization or approval (unless such judicial authorization or 
approval is required by applicable law) and without the filing of any bond. The Trustees' 
determination to transfer the situs of any trust under this Agreement shall be evidenced by an 
instrument in writing signed, witnessed and acknowledged by the Trustees in the same manner 
as would be required for a deed. The Trustees are authorized to take whatever actions are 
necessary to effect such a transfer of situs. If judicial authorization or approval is required to 
effect such a transfer of situs, I intend and desire that the appropriate court accept the 
determination of the Trustees concerning the transfer of the situs of such trust even if one or 
more Beneficiaries disagree with such determination. From and after the Trustees' transfer of 
the sifts of a trust pursuant to this Section 8.3 of this Article VIII, the administration of such 
trust shall be governed by the law of the new situs of such trust.
