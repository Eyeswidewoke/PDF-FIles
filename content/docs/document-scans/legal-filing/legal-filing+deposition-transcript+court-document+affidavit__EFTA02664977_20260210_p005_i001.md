The Department of Justice lost its latest battle with Congress Thurs=ay when it agreed to brief House Intelligence 
Committee members about a to=-secret intelligence source that was part of the FBI's investigati=n of the Trump 
campaign. Even without official confirmation of that source=E244s name, the news so far holds some stunning 
implications.</=> 
Among them is that the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of l=vestigation outright hid critical information from a 
congressional investi=ation. In a Thursday press conference, Speaker Paul Ryan bluntly noted tha= Intelligence Chairman 
Devin Nunes's request for details on this s=cret source was "wholly appropriate," "completely =ithin the scope" of the 
committee's long-running FBI inves=igation, and "something that probably should have been answered a =hile ago." 
Translation: The department knew full well it should haze turned this material over to congressional investigators last 
year, but =nstead deliberately concealed it. 
House investigators nonetheless sniffed out a name, and Mr. Nunes in rec=nt weeks issued a letter and a subpoena 
demanding more details. Deputy Att=rney General Rod Rosenstein's response was to double down—=ccusing the House 
of "extortion" and delivering a speech i= which he claimed that "declining to open the FBI's files =o review" is a 
constitutional "duty." Justice aske= the White House to back its stonewall. And it even began spinning that da=dy of all 
superspook arguments—that revealing any detail about thi= particular asset could result in "loss of human 
lives."</=pan> 
The bureau already has some explaining to do. Thanks =o the Washington Post's unnamed law-enforcement leakers, we 
know M=. Nunes's request deals with a "top secret intelligence so=rce" of the FBI and CIA, who is a U.S. citizen and who 
was involve= in the Russia collusion probe. When government agencies refer to sources,=they mean people who appear 
to be average citizens but use their professio= or contacts to spy for the agency. Ergo, we might take this to mean that 
=he FBI secretly had a person on the payroll who used his or her non-FBI cr=dentials to interact in some capacity with 
the Trump campaign.

wrap:break-word">This would amount to spying, and it is huge=y disconcerting. It would also be a major escalation from 
the electronic s=rveillance we already knew about, which was bad enough. Obama political ap=ointees rampantly 
"unmasked" Trump campaign officials to m=nitor their conversations, while the FBI played dirty with its surveillanc= 
warrant against Carter Page, failing to tell the Foreign Intelligence Sur=eillance Court that its supporting information 
came from the Hillary Clint=n campaign. Now we find it may have also been rolling out human intelligen=e, John Le 
Carre style, to infiltrate the Trump campaign.

wrap:break-word">Which would lead to another big question fo= the FBI: When? The bureau has been doggedly sticking 
with its story that = tip in July 2016 about the drunken ramblings of George Papadopoulos launc=ed its 
counterintelligence probe. Still, the players in this affair4>=94the FBI, former Director Jim Comey, the Steele dossier 
authors—h=ve been suspiciously vague on the key moments leading up to that launch da=e. When precisely was the 
Steele dossier delivered to the FBI? When precis=ly did the Papadopoulos information come in? 
=span style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)">And to the point, when=precisely was this human source 
operating? Because if it was prior to that=infamous Papadopoulos tip, then the FBI isn't being straight. It w=uld mean 
the bureau was spying on the Trump campaign prior to that moment.=And that in turn would mean that the FBI had 
been spurred to act on the ba=is of something other than a junior campaign aide's loose lips. 
We also know that among the Justi=e Department's stated reasons for not complying with the Nunes sub=oena was its 
worry that to do so might damage international relationships.=This suggests the "source" may be overseas, have ties to 
(=reign intelligence, or both. That's notable, given the highly susp=cious role foreigners have played in this escapade. It 
was an Australian d=plomat who reported the Papadopoulos conversation. Dossier author Christop=er Steele is British, 
used to work for MI6, and retains ties to that spy a=ency as well as to a network of former spooks. It was a former British
