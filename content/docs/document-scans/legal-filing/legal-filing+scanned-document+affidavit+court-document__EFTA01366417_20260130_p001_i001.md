precedent, submit to the court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against 
public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed byby the final adjudication of such issue. 
In accordance with Section 102(bX7) of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 
will provide that no director shall be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for monetary damages 
resulting from breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except to the extent such limitation on or exemption 
from liability is not permitted under the DGCL. The effect of this provision of our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation is to eliminate our rights and those of our stockholders (through stockholders' 
derivative suits on our behalf) to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of the fiduciary duty of 
care as a director, including breaches resulting from negligent or grossly negligent behavior, except, as restricted 
by Section 102(bX7) of the DGCL. However, this provision does not limit or eliminate our rights or the rights of 
any stockholder to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission. in the event of a breach of a 
director's duty of care. 
If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the liability of directors, 
then, in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the liability of our directors to us 
or our stockholders will be eliminated or limited 
11-3 
to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or amendment of provisions of our 
amended and restated certificate of incorporation limiting or eliminating the liability of directors, whether by ow 
stockholders or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provisions inconsistent therewith, will (unless 
otherwise required by law) be prospective only. except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits us 
to further limit or eliminate the liability of directors on a retroactive basis. 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also provide that we will, to the fullest extent 
authorized or permitted by applicable law, indemnify our current and former officers and directors, as well as 
those persons who, while directors or officers of our corporation. are or were serving as directors, officers, 
employees or agents of another entity, trust or other entaprise. including service with respect to an employes: 
benefit plan, in connection with any threatened, pending or completed proceeding, whether civil, criminal. 
administrative or investigative, against all expense. liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorney's fees. 
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or 
suffered by any such person in connection with any such proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person 
eligible for indemnification pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will be indemnified 
by us in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person only if such proceeding was authorized by our 
board of directors, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification. 
The right to indemnification conferred by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is a contract 
right that includes the right to be paid by us the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any 
proceeding referenced above in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that if the IXICL requires. an 
advancement of expenses incurred by our officer or director (solely in the capacity as an officer or director of our 
corporation) will be made only upon delivery to us of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such officer or director, 
to repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified 
for such expenses under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or otherwise. 
The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights 
which any person covered by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have or hereafter acquire 
under law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws. an agreement, vote of stockholders 
or disinterested directors. or otherwise. 
Any repeal or amendment of provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation affecting 
indemnification rights, whether by our stockholders or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provisions 
inconsistent therewith, will (unless otherwise required by law) be prospective only, except to the extent such 
amendment or change in law permits us to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis, and will 
not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or 
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such 
repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision. Our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation will also permit us, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and 
to advance expenses to persons other that those specifically covered by our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation. 
Our bylaws, which we intend to adopt immediately prior to the closing of this offering, include the provisions 
relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification rights consistent with those set forth in our amended and
