Artificial Intelligence and State-Sponsored Cyber Espionage 
NYU Journal of Intellectual Property (02/25, Lipsker) reported that the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to a 
new era of state-sponsored cyber espionage, posing significant global security risks, as seen in North Korea's 
notorious hacking campaigns. According to the article, AI-enhanced malware can self-evolve and bypass 
conventional defenses, making traditional cybersecurity strategies ineffective, and nations like South Korea are 
revising their cybersecurity strategies to incorporate AI-driven tools. The article noted that the use of AI in cyber 
espionage raises ethical concerns and creates new challenges, but it also offers solutions, such as AI-powered 
cybersecurity tools that can detect and respond to malicious activity more effectively, as noted by experts at the 
FBI. 'As technology continues to evolve, so do cybercriminals' tactics. Attackers are leveraging Al to craft highly 
convincing voice or video messages and emails to enable fraud schemes against individuals and businesses alike," 
said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Tripp. "These sophisticated tactics can result in devastating financial 
losses, reputational damage, and compromise of sensitive data." For instance, AI-powered voice and video cloning 
scams have tricked victims into divulging sensitive information by mimicking trusted individuals. 
Continued Reporting: UK's Encryption Backdoor Demand Sparks Global Cybersecurity Concerns as Apple 
Withdraws Advanced Data Protection 
Lawfare Media (02/25, Landau) reported that the United Kingdom's demand for Apple to create a backdoor to its 
end-to-end encrypted iCloud data threatens global cybersecurity. According to the article, this move undermines 
Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) and could expose sensitive information to espionage—much like the 2024 
Chinese hack of U.S. phone networks described as "an intelligence failure roughly on par with putting Kim Philby in 
charge of the FBI's Russia counterintelligence office." The article noted that these U.K. requirements mirror bulk 
data collection practices that the U.S. ultimately abandoned for being ineffective and dangerous to privacy, warning 
that once a backdoor exists, hostile actors can exploit it and imperil everyone's security. Forbes (02/25, Doffman) 
added that the U.K. spy agency, National Cyber Security Centre, advises iPhone users to turn on the Advanced Data 
Protection setting to protect against attacks. However, Apple has withdrawn this setting from the U.K. due to 
government demands for access to fully encrypted data. The article explained that the move has sparked debate, 
with some agencies, like the National Cyber Security Centre and CISA, advocating for strong encryption, while 
others, like the FBI, push for "lawful access" to encrypted content. 
Opinion: DOGE Is Risking a National Security Nightmare 
An opinion piece from the Washington Examiner (02/25, Schindler) reported that Elon Musk's Department of 
Government Efficiency (DOGE) has sparked concerns about national security due to its lack of understanding of 
federal bureaucracy and security protocols. According to the article, multiple federal departments, including those 
led by Tulsi Gabbard and Director Patel, have instructed their employees to ignore DOGE's demand for information, 
citing potential risks to intelligence community personnel and national security. The article noted that the vetting 
process for DOGE personnel has been questioned, with concerns that it may not be following established federal 
guidelines, potentially putting national security at risk, similar to the security breaches experienced by the 
Manhattan Project during World War II.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
To Identify Suspect in Idaho Killings, FBI Used Restricted Consumer DNA Data 
The New York Times (02/25, Baker) reported that as investigators struggled for weeks to find who might have 
committed the brutal stabbings of four University of Idaho students in the fall of 2022, they were focused on a key 
piece of evidence: DNA on a knife sheath that was found at the scene of the crime. According to the article, at first 
they tried checking the DNA with law enforcement databases, but that did not provide a hit. They turned next to 
the more expansive DNA profiles available in some consumer databases in which users had consented to law 
enforcement possibly using their information, but that also did not lead to answers. FBI investigators then went a 
step further, according to newly released testimony, comparing the DNA profile from the knife sheath with two 
databases that law enforcement officials are not supposed to tap: GEDmatch and MyHeritage. The article noted 
that days after the FBI's investigative genetic genealogy team began working with the DNA profiles, it landed on 
someone who had not been on anyone's radar: Bryan Kohberger, a Ph.D. student in criminology who has now been 
charged with the murders. The case has shown both the promise and the unregulated power of genetic technology 
in an era in which millions of people willingly contribute their DNA profiles to recreational databases, often to hunt
