directors will be further limited to the greatest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
In addition, our amended and restated bylaws, which will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this 
offering. provide that we will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any person who is or was a party or is threatened to 
be made a party to any action, suit, or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was one of our directors or officers or is 
or was serving at our request as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Our 
amended and restated bylaws provide that we may indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person who is or was a 
party or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit, or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was one of our 
employees or agents or is or was serving at our request as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, 
trust, or other enterprise. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that we must advance expenses incurred by or on behalf 
of a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding, subject to limited exceptions. 
Further, we have entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers 
that may be broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the Delaware General Corporation Law. These 
indemnification agreements require us, among other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers against liabilities that 
may arise by reason of their status or service. These indemnification agreements also require us to advance all expenses incurred 
by the directors and executive officers in investigating or defending any such action, suit or proceeding. We believe that these 
agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and executive officers. 
The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions that are included in our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers may 
discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and executive officers for breach of their fiduciary duties. They 
may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and executive officers, even though an action, if 
successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder's investment may be adversely affected to the extent 
that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and executive officers as required by these 
indemnification provisions. At present, we are not aware of any pending litigation or proceeding involving any person who is or was 
one of our directors, officers, employees, or other agents or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer, employee, or 
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, for which indemnification is sought, and we are 
not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification. 
We have obtained insurance policies under which, subject to the limitations of the policies, coverage is provided to our 
directors and executive officers against losses arising from claims made by reason of breach of fiduciary duty or other wrongful acts 
as a director or executive officer, including claims relating to public securities matters, and to us with respect to payments that may 
be made by us to these directors and executive officers pursuant to our indemnification obligations or otherwise as a matter of law. 
Certain of our non-employee directors may, through their relationships with their employers, be insured and/or indemnified 
against certain liabilities incurred in their capacity as members of our board of directors.

The underwriting agreement provides for indemnification by the underwriters of us and our officers and directors for certain 
liabilities arising under the Securities Act or otherwise. 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons 
controlling our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such 
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 
Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions 
Our audit and risk committee will have the primary responsibility for reviewing and approving or disapproving "related party 
transactions," which are transactions between us and related persons in which the aggregate amount involved exceeds or may be 
expected to exceed $120,000 and in which a related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The charter of our 
audit and risk committee provides that our audit and risk committee shall review and approve in advance any related party 
transaction. 
Prior to the completion of this offering, we intend to adopt a formal written policy providing that we are not permitted to enter
