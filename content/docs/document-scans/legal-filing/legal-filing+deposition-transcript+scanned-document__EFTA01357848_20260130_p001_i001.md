Certification 
Under penalties of perjury, I certify that: 
1. The number shown on this form is my correct taxpayer identification number (or I am waiting for a number to be issued to me), and 
2. I am not subject to backup withholding because: (a) I am exempt from backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) that I am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me that I am 
no longer subject to backup withholding, and 
3. I am a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person (defined below). 
Certification instructions. You must cross out item 2 above if you have been notified by the IRS that you are currently subject to backup withholding 
because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax return. For real estate transactions, item 2 does not apply. For mortgage 
interest paid, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, contributions to an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), and 
generally, payments other than interest and dividends, you are not required to sign the certification, but you must provide your correct TIN. See the 
instructions on page 4.

Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise 
noted. 
Purpose of Form 
A person who is required to file an information return with the IRS must 
obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) to report, for 
example, income paid to you, real estate transactions, mortgage interest 
you paid, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation 
of debt, or contributions you made to an IRA. 
Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident 
alien), to provide your correct TIN to the person requesting it (the 
requester) and, when applicable, to: 
1. Certify that the TIN you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a 
number to be issued). 
2. Certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or 
3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt 
payee. If applicable, you are also certifying that as a U.S. person, your 
allocable share of any partnership income from a U.S. trade or business 
is not subject to the withholding tax on foreign partners' share of 
effectively connected income. 
Note. If a requester gives you a form other than Form W-9 to request 
your TIN, you must use the requester's form if it is substantially similar 
to this Form W-9. 
Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are 
considered a U.S. person if you are: 
• An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, 
• A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or 
organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, 
• An estate (other than a foreign estate), or 
• A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7). 
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or 
business in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding 
tax on any foreign partners' share of income from such business. 
Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, a 
partnership is required to presume that a partner is a foreign person, 
and pay the withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a 
partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United 
States, provide Form W9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. 
status and avoid withholding on your share of partnership income.
