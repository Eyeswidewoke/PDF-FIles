Fund or a partnership in which the Underlying Fund invests (even if, with respect to such partnership, the 
Underlying Fund was not a partner of the partnership during the tax year under audit). 
United States Tar Reporting by Limited Partners that are Owners of Non-US Entities. United States tax 
rules impose information reporting requirements on U.S. persons that own, either directly or indirectly 
under certain attribution rules, more than certain threshold amounts of stock in a non-U.S. corporation. 
These persons must disclose, among other things, various transactions between themselves and those non-
U.S. corporations. For this purpose, stock ownership is determined with regard to certain stock attribution 
rules, and each Limited Partner is treated as owning part or all of the stock owned directly or indirectly by 
the Access Fund. In certain circumstances, these rules may require Limited Partners to file reports annually. 
A significant monetary penalty may be imposed on a Limited Partner that fails to satisfy any applicable 
reporting requirements. 
A Limited Partner will be responsible for determining whether it is required to file any information returns 
or statements or otherwise report any information with respect to any non-U.S. entities as a result of owning 
Interests, and for satisfying any such filing or reporting requirements. The Access Fund may not be able to 
provide a Limited Partner with information requested by the Limited Partner in connection with completing 
any filing requirements due to confidentiality restrictions, unavailability of the information requested or 
other reasons. 
Specifically, U.S. individuals (and possibly certain entities) are generally required to file certain 
infommtion with their annual U.S. federal income tax return regarding interests they hold in foreign 
entities or accounts worth more than $50,000 at any time during the year. If the General Partner were to 
offer a structure where Limited Partners own their investment in the Access Fund through a non-U.S. 
entity, it is possible any such Limited Partners would be subject to such information reporting. In addition, 
a separate obligation to file an annual Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (an "FBAR") 
applies to any U.S. person who has a financial interest in, or signature or other authority over, non-U.S. 
financial accounts worth more than $10,000 at any time during the year. Under the FBAR regulations, 
ownership by a U.S. person of an interest in a foreign private fund entity is not currently subject to FBAR 
reporting, but the regulations continue to reserve on the application of the FBAR rules to such interest. 
Potential investors should discuss the application of the above rules with their own advisers in light of 
their individual circumstances. 
Qualified Dividend Income. Subject to certain elections, "qualified dividend income" is generally taxable 
to non-corporate taxpayers at reduced U.S. federal income tax rates. A Limited Partner's qualified dividend 
income may include the Limited Partner's indirect allocable share of certain dividends received by the 
Access Fund from U.S. corporations and qualified foreign corporations. Subject to certain limitations, 
qualified foreign corporations include those incorporated in a possession of the United States and foreign 
corporations eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty identified by the IRS, but do not 
include foreign corporations that are treated as "passive foreign investment companies" for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes. A dividend of a foreign corporation may also be treated as qualified dividend income 
if the stock with respect to which the dividend is paid is readily tradable on an established securities market 
in the United States. 
In order for Limited Partners to qualify for the lower tax rate with respect to their indirect allocable share 
of qualified dividends, however, the Access Fund must hold the shares of stock producing the dividend for 
at least 61 days during the 121-day period beginning on the date that is 60 days before the date such shares 
become a -dividend. For preferred stock, thc required periods arc increased from 61 days to 91 days and 
from 121 days to 181 days if the dividends are attributable to periods totaling more than 366 days; if the
