(1) The statutory compensation schemes shall have the functions and powers under this Act, and 
in particular they shall collect the contributions of the CRR credit institutions that have been assigned to 
them, they shall invest the funds as provided for under this Act and, if a compensation event occurs, they 
shall compensate the creditors of a CRR credit institution that has been assigned to them for deposits 
that have not been repaid. 
(2) Statutory compensation schemes are 
1 
legal persons under private law to which the functions and powers of a statutory compensation 
scheme under this Act have been allocated by way of a statutory order issued under section 23 (1) 
(entrusted compensation schemes), 
2 
compensation schemes established at Kreditanstalt fir Wiederaufbau (IOW) by way of a statutory 
order under section 23 (2). 
(3) BaFin shall decide on objections to administrative decisions by the statutory compensation 
schemes. 
(4) In discharging its obligations under section 5, the statutory compensation scheme shall only be

entrusted compensation scheme shall hold and administer these assets separately from its other assets. 
Section 23 
Authority to issue orders 
(1) The Federal Ministry of Finance is authorised to assign, by way of a statutory order that does 
not require the approval of the Bundesrat, to a legal person under private law the functions and powers of 
a statutory compensation scheme if that legal person is prepared to assume the functions of the 
compensation scheme and offers reasonable assurance that the claims of persons eligible for 
compensation will be settled. A legal person offers reasonable assurance if 
1 
the persons who manage and represent the legal person under the law or the articles of 
association are fit and proper and 
2 
it has the resources and organisation needed to perform its functions, in particular in relation to 
collecting contributions, managing the funds and making compensation payments, and has own 
funds equivalent to at least El million for this purpose. 
By way of the statutory order under sentence 1 above, the Federal Ministry of Finance may reserve the 
right to approve the articles of association of the legal person and any amendments to them, and to issue 
more detailed requirements governing the liquidation and winding-up of the compensation scheme. 
(2) The Federal Ministry of Finance is authorised, by way of a statutory order that does not require 
the approval of the Bundesrat, to establish statutory compensation schemes at KM and to issue more 
detailed requirements governing the administration of statutory compensation schemes and the 
appropriate remuneration of their management, if statutory compensation schemes in accordance with 
section 22 (2) number 1 are not available, and in particular if such a compensation scheme is liquidated 
or wound up. 
Section 24 
Assignment of CRR credit institutions to a statutory compensation scheme 
(1) One of the following groups of institutions shall be assigned to each of the statutory 
compensation schemes: 
1 
the group of CRR credit institutions established under private law or 
2 
the group of CRR credit institutions established under public law. 
(2) BaFin may, on request, assign a CRR credit institution to another statutory compensation 
scheme if 
1 
the CRR credit institution is able to demonstrate a justified interest in the requested assignment, 
2 
this will not endanger performance of the function of the statutory compensation scheme to which 
the CRR credit institution belongs and
