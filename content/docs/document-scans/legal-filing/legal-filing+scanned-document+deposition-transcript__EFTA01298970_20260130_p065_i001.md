351 F. Supp. 2d 329, *; 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26378, **; 
46 V.I. 435, *** 
II. LEGAL ANALYSIS 
A. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) 
["3] [HN1] In order to state a viable fraud claim, Rule 9(b) requires a plaintiff to ['331] 
plead (1) a specific false representation or omission of material fact; (2) knowledge by the 
person who made it of its falsity; (3) ignorance of its falsity by the person to whom it was 
made; (4) the intention that it should be acted upon; and (5) that the plaintiff acted upon it 
to his damages." in re Rockefeller Ctr. Props. Secs. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 215 (3d Cir. 
2002). Courts should apply Rule 9(b) with some flexibility and should not require plaintiffs 
to plead issues that may have been concealed by the defendants. Rola v. City Investing 
Co. Liquidating Trust, 155 F.3d 644 (3d Cir. 1998). Although the rule does not require a 
recitation of "every material detail" of the alleged fraud, it does require "that plaintiffs 
support their allegations of fraud with all of the essential factual background that would 
accompany 'the first paragraph of any newspaper story' - that is the 'who, what, when, 
where and how of the events at issue."' In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc., 311 F.3d at 217 
(quoting In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, at ["**438] 1422). 
However, the ["4] Third Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the "requirements of Rule 
9(b) may be satisfied if the complaint describes the circumstances of the alleged fraud with 
'precise allegations of date, time or place' or by using some means of 'injecting precision 
and some means of substantiation into their allegations of fraud."' Bd. of Trs. v. Foodtown, 
Inc., 296 F.3d 164, 173 n.10 (3d Cir. 2002) (internal citations omitted). 
Plaintiffs allege that false statements or statements where material facts were omitted 
were made pursuant to a course of conduct to fraudulently induce plaintiffs into a series of 
investments and related loans. Plaintiffs allege that Citibank's actions did not conform to 
the representations in the statements, that defendants were acting in plaintiffs' best 
interests. For example, it is alleged that in conversations between April 29, 1999 and May 
2, 1999, Dayle Davison, a Vice President of Citibank in the Private Banking Division, called 
Epstein to introduce him to an "exceptional investment opportunity." (Compl. P 13.) In 
follow-up telephone conversations during that same two week period, Davison and her 
associates r 5] made additional specific representations about the AIG Investment, 
without disclosing Citibank and AIG's relationship. Davison also during that period 
represented that Citibank had "done their due diligence" and would remain actively 
involved in the deal. (Compl. P 14.) In August 2001, in an effort to dissuade Epstein from 
seeking to remove AIG as the manager of the AIG Investment, John Purcell, a Citibank 
representative, told Jeffrey Schantz, a lawyer for Epstein, that Citibank was acting in 
Epstein's interests and that Epstein should trust Citibank rather than talk about actions 
which would run counter to Citibank's undisclosed interests. (Compl. P 37.) These facts all 
allege that defendants failed to state or disclose "additional or qualifying information 
regarding" their relationship with AIG. 
These specific facts are enough to plead fraud with the particularity required by Rule 9(b). 
The plaintiffs have alleged that Davison, Epstein's primary contact at Citibank, made 
specific false representation and omissions of material facts of the relationship between 
AIG and Citibank in April and May of 1999. The complaint has also alleged that Davison, 
and others at Citibank, knew of the ["6] relationship between Citibank and AIG and that
