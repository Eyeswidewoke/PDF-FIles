residue to pay the Obligations in such order as it 
elects and Debtor will remain liable for any 
deficiency with interest. 
All foreign exchange 
losses incurred in connection with the conversion 
of any Collateral denominated in a foreign currency 
to U.S. dollars shall be borne by Debtor. If Lender 
shall be subject to any volume limitations in the 
sale of Collateral, Debtor shall not at any such time 
sell, or permit any party controlled by Debtor to 
sell, any securities if the sale thereof would 
adversely affect Lender's ability to sell the 
Collateral. If Lender sells any of the Collateral 
upon credit, Debtor will be credited only with 
payments actually made by the purchaser, received 
by Lender and applied to the indebtedness of the 
purchaser. In the event the purchaser fails to pay 
for the Collateral, Lender may resell the Collateral 
and Debtor shall be credited with the proceeds of 
the sale. 
8. 
Debtor hereby irrevocably designates 
and appoints each of Lender and any designee or 
agent (each an "Attorney") as attorney-in-fact of 
Debtor, with full power of substitution, each with 
authority acting alone to re-direct, receive and 
dispose of Debtor's mail, sign or endorse Debtor's 
name on notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, 
instruments, certificates, powers, assignments and 
other documents, execute proofs of claim and loss, 
releases, endorsements, assignments and other 
instruments of conveyance, and do all other acts 
and things necessary and advisable in the sole 
discretion of Attorney to carry out and enforce this 
Agreement. All acts of each Attorney are hereby 
ratified and approved and no Attorney shall be 
liable for any acts of commission or omission or for 
errors of judgment or mistake of fact or law. This 
power of attorney is irrevocable and coupled with 
an interest. 
9. In the event and to the extent that any 
provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal 
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, 
legality and enforceability of the remaining 
provisions, or of such provision in any other 
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or 
16178v12 
impaired thereby. 
10. No failure or delay by Lender in 
exercising any right or remedy and no course of 
dealing between Lender and Debtor shall operate as 
a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial 
exercise of any right preclude any other or future 
exercise thereof. All rights and remedies of Lender 
shall be cumulative and may be exercised singly or 
concurrently. No notice to or demand on Debtor 
shall entitle Debtor to any other or further notice or 
demand, or constitute a waiver of Lender's rights. 
II. This Agreement may not be modified, 
changed, waived or discharged orally, but only by a 
writing signed by the parties hereto. Any waiver of 
any provision of this Agreement or any consent to 
any departure by Debtor therefrom shall be 
effective only in the specific instance and for the 
specific purpose for which given. This Agreement 
shall be and remain the independent obligation of 
Debtor, shall inure to the benefit of and be 
enforceable 
by 
Lender 
and 
its 
successors, 
transferees and assigns, and shall be binding upon 
Debtor and Debtor's heirs, executors, successors 
and assigns, provided that Debtor may not transfer, 
assign or delegate any of Debtor's rights or 
obligations hereunder, and, at Lender's option, any 
such purported transfer, assignment or delegation 
shall be void. This Agreement shall terminate upon 
final payment in full to Lender of all of the 
Obligations and termination of any obligation of 
Lender to make advances, and shall continue to be 
effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, 
if at any time payment of or on account of any of 
the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be 
restored or returned by Lender upon the insolvency, 
bankruptcy or reorganization of Debtor or any other 
person or otherwise, all as though such payment 
had not been made. 
12. Lender is hereby authorized at any time 
and from time to time, to the fullest extent 
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all 
deposits (general or special, time or demand, 
provisional or final) at any time held and other
