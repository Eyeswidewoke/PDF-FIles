stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a "preferential 
transfer" or a "fraudulent conveyance.- As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received 
by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our 
creditors and/or having acted in bad faith. thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying 
public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. 
36 
If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy 
petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of 
creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share 
amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be 
reduced. 
If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy 
petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust 
account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject 
to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims 
deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwim be received by our stockholders in 
connection with our liquidation may be reduced. 
If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to 
institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it 
difficult for us to complete our business combination. 
If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activitits may be 
restricted, including: 
• restrictions on the nature of our investments, and 
• restrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our 
business combination. 
In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including: 
• registration as an investment company; 
• adoption of a specific fomi of corporate structure: and 
• reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations. 
We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. 
The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trustee only in United States government treasury 
bills with a maturity of IS0 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in United States Treasuries 
and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Because the investment of 
the proceeds will be restricted to these instruments, we believe we will meet the requirements for the exemption 
provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the 
Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses 
for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to consummate a business combination. If we 
were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens 
would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a 
business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may 
receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire 
worthless. 
Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect 
our business, investments and results of operations. 
We are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national. regional and local governments. In particular. we 
will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with. and monitoring of. 
applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their 
interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse 
effect on our 
37 
business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or 
regulations. as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of 
operations. 
Our stockholders may be held liable for claims b) third parties against us to the extent of distributions
