Future sales, or the perception of future sales, of our cofnmon stock may depress the price of our common stock. 
The market price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our stock in the market after this offering, 
including shares which might be offered for sale by IAC. The perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of common stock. These 
sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we 
deem appropriate. See "—Future sales or distributions of our shares by IAC could depress our common stock price." 
Upon completion of this offering, we will have 33.333.333 shares of common stock (or 38.333,333 shares if the underwriters exercise in full their option to 
purchase additional shares of our common stock). 206.714.274 shares of Class B common stock and no shares of Class C common stock outstanding. The 
shares of common stock offered in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933. or the Securities Act. except for any 
shares of common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, 
which will be restricted securities under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the 
Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available. We will grant registration rights to IAC with respect to shares of our common stock and Class B 
common stock. Any shares registered pursuant to the registration rights agreement described in "Certain relationships and related party transactions" will be 
freely tradable in the public market following a 180-day lock-up period as described below. 
In connection with this offering. we, our directors and executive officers and IAC will each agree to enter into a lock-up agreement and thereby be subject to a 
lock-up period, meaning that they and their permitted transferees will not be permitted to sell any of the shares of our capital stock for 180 days after the date 
of this prospectus. subject to certain exceptions without the prior consent of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Allen 8 Company LLC. Although we have been 
advised that there is no present intention to do so. the representatives at the underwriters may. in their sole discretion and without notice, release all or any 
portion of the shares from the restrictions in any of the lock-up agreements described above. See "Underwriting." 
Also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our capital stock issued in connection 
with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding shares of our common stock. 
An active trading market for our common stock may never develop or be sustained. 
We have applied to list our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "MTCH." However, we cannot assure you that an active 
trading market for our common stock will develop on that exchange or elsewhere or, if developed, that any market will be sustained. Accordingly, we cannot 
assure you of the likelihood that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be maintained, the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to 
sell your shares of our common stock when desired or the prices that you may obtain for your shares.
