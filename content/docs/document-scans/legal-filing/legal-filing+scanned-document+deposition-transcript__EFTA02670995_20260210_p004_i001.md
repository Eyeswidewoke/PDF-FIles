$480M net cash and a lowly valuation. But if there is a path to Dialog losing say half of the current 
revenue base over the next two years then it is difficult to ascertain the floor with so much uncertainty. 
Taking a midpoint of this wide range would imply a risk of 30% to current consensus revenue estimates 
for 2019. Standing still on current (already very low) valuation metrics would imply fair value/floor at 
around E13/share. 
The bigger question here is that Apple needs to control more of the key technology building blocks for 
sophisticated designs and seeks to find ways to prevent the BOM (Bill of Materials) of the iPhone from 
spiking higher. Companies such as Dialog (7x PIE) and Cirrus Logic (12x P/E) have valuations that 
reflect such a risk with heavy reliance on Apple as a customer. Newer technologies (3D sensing, ToF) 
may not have the same short term risk, but ultimately the valuations will likely fade as the technologies 
become more mainstream, competitive advantages of leaders get lessened and Apple exerts pricing 
power. AMS trades on 30x 2018 PIE (with downside risk to the "E") and the huge ramp of volumes, 
design wins and market share dominance which many expect through the next two to three years may 
not transpire. 
eSports: Livestreaming explodes 
Live streamers in the U.S. on sites like Twitch (Amazon owned) are almost as influential as journalists 
when it comes to influencing purchasing intent (15% vs 16%). PayPal survey shows that 34% of 
livestream viewers in the U.S. have spent more than $50 on livestream content in the last three months 
(which amounts to more than a Netflix subscription and is similar to what is spent on a full game 
($53.56). This is before we even get the new Fortnite eSports competition which will see $100M in prize 
money, 4x the size of any eSport before. By comparison the current French Open Tennis Grand Slam 
has a total prize pool of E39M.

Trade Wars and China IP curve 
Reuters report that the U.S. plan to push ahead with plans to apply a 25% tariff on $50B of Chinese 
goods by 15th June, as well as an announcement of investment restrictions and enhanced export 
controls for Chinese persons and entities that "related to the acquisition of industrially significant 
technology' by the end of June. It echoes the emergency CFIUS policies considered earlier this year and 
goes back to the core of the battle over IP. China State press this morning warn that a full-scale trade 
war would be inevitable if the tariffs proceed. The move would also mean that any previous agreements 
reached by both sides would be rendered invalid and China would then respond with similar punitive 
measures. China doesn't want a trade war, but it seems that it is willing to go into battle and fight if 
required. Perhaps all this uncertainty explains why Apple has been stockpiling component inventory? 
After all the same measure grew 170% YoY last quarter and Apple, as the most global of corporations, 
would be at risk of supply chain shocks. 
Meanwhile this week it was reported this week that after three years the province in Hefei has 
successfully built out one of the fastest growing IC clusters in China; a total of 129 IC companies across 
foundries, fabless firms and back end companies have set up and created a complete local supply chain. 
The output value of the Hefei IC industry grew 31% in 2017, and remember this is before the significant 
tax breaks for the semiconductor industry in China were announced earlier this year. 
Ubisoft (Buy): Two positives at the beginning of June 
This weekend sees Ubisoft's latest title, The Crew 2, move into open beta. Our early tracking of social 
media suggests it is being well received. The original title, released in 2014. was described as an 
average, hollow racing game that didn't trouble rivals Forza or Need for Speed. We were impressed with 
the gameplay shown last year at E3 and felt the variety of experiences, challenges and types of vehicles 
(changing from a stunt plane to a speed boat on the fly for example) was a massive improvement. The 
beta shows a 'loot system' where items are awarded after finishing certain races and with them allowing 
customization of parts and performance (handling, power, speeds) could be attractive for gamers who
