Note 8—Contingencies 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a party to various lawsuits, The Company establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it 
determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management has also identified certain other legal 
matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore. no reserve is established.

a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and 
managements view of these matters may change in the future. The Company also evaluates other contingent matters. including income and non-Income tax 
contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or 
more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company. See
