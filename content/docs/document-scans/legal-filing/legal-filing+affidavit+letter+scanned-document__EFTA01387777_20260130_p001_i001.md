Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education and Dr. Heather Wilson as the Secretary of the Air 
Force." 
Then returning, as if reflexively, to the mantra of Hillary's past questionable behavior 
towards women, Pirro stated, " Just remember, as I document in the book, when Bill was 
president, Hillary, from an ad hoc 'war room' set up right in the middle of the White House, 
employed Mafia like tactics of fear, threats and intimidation directed against women who 
her husband had sexually assaulted to scare them from going public with their accusations 
against him. So, of course, a woman like that does not care about the measurable gains 
women have achieved from Trump, because the truth is she disdains women, just as much 
as she disdains the President." 
Pirro's indictment in the book and during the interview of both Hillary and Bill for their 
mistreatment of women does not end there. According to Pirro, each has found common 
cause and even friendship with pedophiles. In Hillary's case the pedophile was Alfred 
Taylor; in Bill's case the pedophile was his close friend, Florida billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, 
a convicted child sexual predator who, following the Clinton presidency, used his private 
jet to, on numerous occasions, fly the former commander- in chief to sometimes extremely 
questionable locations. 
Referring both to the moniker of Epstein's jet, " The Lolita Express", and to the location 
and name of one of one of those destinations, Epstein's privately owned " Orgy Island", 
situated in the Caribbean, Pirro stated with the unmistakable sound of anger in her voice, 
" For a former president of the United States to fly on a plane named ' The Lolita Express' 
to a place called ' Orgy Island' as the guest, no less, of a convicted pedophile, is sickening 
beyond words; and sadly, the same liberals and liars in the media who have been Clinton 
lap dogs for years have tried their best to keep this story from the public." 
After discussing the Clintons, I was ready to ask Pirro about those "liars and liberals in the 
media" whom she castigates throughout the book for using fabrications, distortions and 
deceptions in their scheme to destroy the Trump presidency. But then I heard in the 
background the voice of one of one of her assistants informing her that there were only 
three minutes remaining before the interview was scheduled to end. 
So I realized I would not have the time to ask Pirro to comment about those ' liars and 
liberals in the media' she excoriates in her book including- the New York Times Nobel 
prize winning economist Paul Krugman, whom she ridicules for incorrectly predicting that 
the stock market would 'plummet' as a result of Trump's economic policies; ABC'S news 
broadcaster Brian Ross whom she rebukes for falsely reporting that former National 
Security Advisor General Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that Trump had instructed 
him to contact Russia before the election; the collective news team at CNN, whom she 
lambasts for airing the soon later proven lie that members of the Trump campaign had 
close connections with the people at WikiLeaks- a controversial website whose founder, 
Julian Assange, facing espionage charges from the United States government, lives in 
asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in England. 
Nor, I realized, would I have the time to ask Pirro to elaborate on the long list of 'liars and 
leakers' currently or previously working in high level positions in the federal government, 
whom she denounces in her book for being part of the " Deep State" purported to be a
