509 F. Supp. 815, *; 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11119, **; 
1981-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P64,165 
Plaintiff's claims do not involve any racially discriminatory practices that might justify a 
more expansive approach to the issue. Based upon the state action allegations contained 
in the Amended Complaint, the private hospital and physician defendants are not subject 
to suit under § 1983 for their actions against the plaintiff, actions involving the 
administrative affairs of the hospitals. 
The policy of the Orange Memorial Hospital Corporation does r'22] not impinge upon the rights of a racial group 
seeking admittance and treatment. but rather affects primarily only the interns? affairs of the facility. A secondary effect 
of the corporation's policy is admittedly to discriminate against persons seeking to obtain and physicians desiring to 
perform elective abortions. We feel, however, that the interest of the hospital in ordering its internal administrative 
affairs outweighs the interest of the people disadvantaged in this case.
Greco, supra at 880. 
What involvement the state may have through its licensing procedures is not actionable 
unless these regulations somehow compelled the hospitals or physicians to act against 
plaintiff in an unlawful manner. Waters v. St. Francis Hospital, 618 F.2d 1105 (5th Cir. 
1980). There is no allegation to this effect in the Amended Complaint. 
(b) § 1985 allegations 
Plaintiff has no claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) since the Amended Complaint fails to 
contain any allegations that would show both the private deprivation of the enjoyment of 
the laws and an invidious class-based discriminatory motivation (usually, but not always, 
involving racial bias). McLellan v. Mississippi Power [""23] & Light Co., 545 F.2d 919 (5th 
Cir. 1977). " 
10. "If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another. 
for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of 
equal privileges and immunities under the laws; or for the purpose of preventing or hindering the constituted authorities of any 
State or Territory from giving or securing to all persons within such State or Territory the equal protection of the laws...." § 
1985(1) and (2) are inapplicable. 
11. This was an en bane decision in which the majority held that an employee discharged from private employment solely 
because he filed a petition in voluntary bankruptcy has no cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). The majority 
exhaustively analyzed the application of the statute by following the guidelines prescribed by the Supreme Court in Griffin v. 
Breckenridge. 403 U.S. 88.91 S. Ct. 1790.29 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1971). The Supreme Court in Griffin held that § 1985(3) reaches 
private conspiracies as well as those performed under color of state law and elucidated the necessary elements to successfully 
maintain a cause of action under this section. In its opinion, the Fifth Circuit expressly reserved decision on whether Congress 
intended only racial bias to activate the provisions of the statute but advised restraint when a court is confronted with class-
based discrirnination grounded in a non-racial animus. McLellan. supra at 929. 
['*24] Plaintiff has not alleged and the Court fails to discern any illegal conduct committed 
by the defendants in acting to deprive plaintiff of a position on the hospital medical staff. 17
Moreover, there has been no allegation of any racially motivated discrimination against 
plaintiff by the defendants. He alleges a class-based animus against him as a podiatrist. 
This discrimination is not actionable under the cases heretofore construing the reach of § 
1985(3): 
Federal Courts have recognized that those who are discriminated against because of political views or associations fall 
with (sic) the protective scope of Section 1985(2) and (3). Courts have found a class-based animus sufficient to 
support causes of action where the conspiracy is directed toward supporters of a particular political candidate.
