B. Framework 
I. `Co Special Deference 
Preliminarily. we note two factors that do nor come into play in today's review. First. the Tax Court neither expressed nor implied 
credibility concerns with any witness. lay or expert. so there arc no credibility calls to which we owe special deference. Second. the 
willing buyerhvilling seller test of fair market value truly is ubiquitous: It is not peculiar to federal tax issues. Rather. it is universally 
employed in myriad legal contexts: civil and criminal: tort and contracts: administrative and insurance. We therefore owe no enhanced 
deference to the Tax Courts application of that test. 
2. Burden of Proof 
As we affirm the Tax Court's ruling that percentages of fractionalownership discount are applicable, we need not consider whether it 
applied the correct burden of proof to reach that conclusion. The second part of today's inquiry—the correct percentages of fractional-
ownership discounts to be applied presents a somewhat thornier question, at least theoretically. The Tax Court failed to require the 
Commissioner to bear that burden of proof. even though 26 U.S.C. §7491 mandates that when, as here, the petitioning taxpayer 
adduces sufficient evidence to establish the material facts—in this case, the amounts of the discounts—the Commissioner has the 
burden of refuting such facts and proving different ones. Yet he chose not to adduce any evidence of discount quantum whatsoever. 
sticking instead to his no-discount position. By contrast, the Estate adduced a plethora of credible and highly probative evidence in 
support of both the applicability of such discounts mei non and the precise percentages of the discount to be applied to each separate 
item, as sununarircd in detail on Exhibit B of the Tax Court's opinion. Under a proper administration of *7491's burden of proof rule. 
this ease should have ended at that point with a judgment for the Estate. But, as shall be seen, the court's failure to assign the burden 
of proof of quantum to the Commissioner, although error, makes no difference in the end. head justify="rp>3. Preponderance of the 
Evidence 
After rejecting the Commissiona's no-discount position, the Tax Court announced that the issue of the burden of proof was not 
important because it would proceed to determine the appropriate quantum of the discounts based on a preponderance of the 
evidence. In most trials, "dal determination of where the preponderance lies requires a measuring and weighing of all the evidence, pro 
and con."' 5 But, when, as here, the only evidence on an issue is that presented by but one party—and by the one that did not have the 
burden of proof, at that—there is no -preponderance": It takes two to tango.'s As with its misapplication of the burden of proof, 
however, the Tax Court's error in announcing its use of the preponderance standard to determine the amounts of the discounts 
ultimately makes no difference. This is because, having put all of his eggs in the one, no-discount basket at trial, the Commissioner 
cannot be heard on appeal to question the quantity, quality, or sufficiency of the evidence adduced by the Estate to prove the quantum 
of the fmctionalownership discounts to be applied.t7 Likewise, given the total absence of substantive evidence from the Commissioner 
on the issue of quantum. the Tax Court should have accepted and applied the uncontradicted quantums of the panial-ownership 
discounts that the Estate proved with much more than substantial evidence. 
15 United States V. Ricks, 639 F.2d 1305, 1309 (5th Cir. Unit B Mar.1981). 
16 Black's Law Dictionary defines "preponderance of the evidence" as: "The greater weight of the evidence. not necessarily established 
by the greater number of witnesses testifying to a fact but by evidence that has the most convincing force: superior evidentiary weight 
that, though not sufficient to free the mind wholly from all reasonable doubt, is still sufficient to incline a fair and impartial mind to 
one side of the issue rather than the other." See Black's Law Dictionary 1301 (9th ed. 2009). 
17 For the first time on appeal, the Commissioner attempts to address the quantum of the fractional-ownership discounts as supporting 
the Tax Court's 10 percent discount. It is well settled, however, that we do not consider contentions raised for the first time on appeal.

4. Merits 
Just as it was obvious to the Tax Court that the Commissioner had no viable basis for rigidly insisting that no fractional-ownership
