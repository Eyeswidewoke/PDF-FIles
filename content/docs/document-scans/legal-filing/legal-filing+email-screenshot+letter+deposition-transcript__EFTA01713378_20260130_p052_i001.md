In an affidavit, Linda said Flack was in the room at the Argent Center when McMahan smashed 
several computer hard drives containing evidence of their incestuous relationship and their 
Westminster Abbey wedding. 
Flack dismisses Linda's claims. 
"I never heard of such a preposterous thing," Flack says of the wedding. 
Before he flew to London in 2004 to marry his daughter, McMahan had separated from his fifth 
wife, Elena. Later that year, he filed for divorce. 
In January 2005, Elena filed an affidavit in the divorce case reportedly accusing McMahan of having 
an incestuous relationship with Linda (the affidavit is under seal but referred to in other court 
papers). Linda alleged in court records that Elena learned of the affair when she hacked into 
Linda's Yahoo email account and retrieved the Westminster Abbey photos. 
In court papers, Linda says that McMahan showed her Elena's affidavit and asked her to make a 
sworn statement of her own, denying their incestuous relationship. When she refused, their 
relationship began to deteriorate. 
"This was a difficult if not unbearable time of my life as I continued to be abused and•subservient 
to McMahan's sexual demands while at the same time knowing that I had lost any semblance of my 
marriage with Sargent," Linda said In a sworn statement this past August. 
In July 2005, Linda refused to continue sleeping with McMahan. In her August sworn statement, 
Linda says McMahan responded to the breakup by saying on the telephone: "I am going to 
preemptively destroy you. If you want to know how I am going to do it, meet me for lunch.' 
Two months later, a legal conflagration was sparked that spread like wildfire: McMahan sued Linda 
through one of his firms, claiming that she'd stolen company computers and trade secrets. Linda 
then sued her father for the income she would have made as his employee. Her estranged 
husband, Schutt, sued McMahan in Mississippi, where it's still legal for one man to sue another for 
ruining his marriage. McMahan then filed another suit against the two of them, as well as Schutt's 
father, accusing them all of conspiring to extort $10 million from him. 
McMahan has a long history of litigating his breakups, both personal and financial. In his divorce 
from Melinda Ewell, for example, he took the case to New York's appellate court, challenging an 
order compelling him to turn over tapes and files investigators had made while he had her under 
surveillance. 
Ewell describes him as an egomaniac who lives his life in a series of ongoing sagas. The drama he 
creates feeds his ego and shapes the story of his life, she says. 
"When you live with someone like that, it's not fun when you challenge them," she said. 
When Ewell made allegations in her divorce that McMahan had treated her cruelly, McMahan 
countersued and accused Ewell of engaging in affairs and "attempting to seduce mutual friends and 
associates," according to an appellate opinion in the case. Ewell tells New Times that one of those 
men was billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who has been much in the news lately for allegedly hiring 
underaged women to strip topless and massage him at his Palm Beach mansion. At the time, in the 
early 1980s, McMahan and Epstein worked together at Bear Stearns in New York. Epstein didn't 
return a request for comment. 
"Jeffrey Epstein worked with [McMahan]. He was, let's just say, in the divorce proceedings," she 
says. 1 was asked to stop by Jeffrey's apartment to pick up some papers for Bruce. It didn't feel 
right, so I didn't even go in. I stood outside the door. And then, later, Jeff said I propositioned him. 
There were always allegations I was having to fight." 
McMahan's business relationships have also ended in grinding court battles, some making it to 
federal appeals courts, creating case law.
