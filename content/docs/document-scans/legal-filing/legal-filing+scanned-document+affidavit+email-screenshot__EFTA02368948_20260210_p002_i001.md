Printing out all my =rticles to date and giving them to Lesl=e so you have copies of your press to date. 
Below is a sample concept: 
Can music be an insight into the workings of the brain? For example, why =oes the brain like to hear octaves, certain 
harmonies and pitch resolution= </=PAN> 
Music is the manipulation of audible frequencie=. More specifically, it is the establishment and manipulation of 
frequency=patterns and frequency intensities. So why does the brain find patterns an= various sequences of frequency 
intensities stimulating? 
r/DIV> 
Some Bac=ground: 
The ear converts all sound waves =nto electrochemical impulses that charge the neocortex of the brain. More 
=pecifically, the basilar membrane of the brain in the cochlea, the small snail-like structure in the inne= ear, vibrates to 
incoming sound and at different sinusoidal frequencies d=e to variations in thickness and width along the length of the 
membrane. <=PAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">Tonotopy studies the spatial arrang=ment of frequencies along the 
basilar membrane. 
=he tonotopy of frequencies projects through the vestibulocochlear nerve, t=rough associated midbrain structures, 
through the auditory radiation pathw=y and to the primary auditory cortex. Throughout the radiation pathway, 
fr=quency organization is linear in accordance to neural sensitivity; =SPAN style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-SIZE: 
12pt">(human auditory neurons =eact to vibrations in air pressure that occur between 20 to 20,000 times p=r second-
20hz to 20,000hz on the human audible spectrum). However, binaural fusion i= the superior oliviary complex affects the 
signal strength of each ganglio=. As a result, six tonotopic maps have be=n identified in the primary auditory cortex of 
humans. 
Pitches are frequencies of increa=ing or decreasing multiples. Higher pitches translate to higher frequencie=. Lower 
pitches to lower ones. Pitches that are an octave apart correspond=to frequencies that have exactly half or double the 
frequency. For example, if one note has = frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880 Hz, and the no=e an 
octave below is at 220 Hz. <=PAN style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Harmonies are frequencies=with whole 
number multiples of the fundamental (or lowest) frequency of an= pitch. Resolution=/SPAN> in western tonal music 
theory is the move of a note or cho=d from dissonance (an unstable sound) to consonance (a more final or stabl= 
sounding one). In terms of audib=e frequency, resolution is the move from non-multiple frequencies back to = frequency 
that is a multiple of the dominant fundamental frequency. 
Theories and Questions:</=> 
1. Patterns, whether visual, rhythmic or audible have =een shown to stimulate the brain. Patterns facilitate and reward 
predictio= and prediction is a network and prioritization of associative memory. Functional Magnetic =esonance Imaging 
(fMRI) shows that the orbitofrontal cortex plays a critic=l role, amongst others, in making predictions and leads to an 
increase in =-endorphin levels and a decrease in plasma cortisol, a marker for stress. So what doe= the desire for 
predictions tell us about the brain? 
2. Similar, to reading a book or watching a movie, the=manipulation of frequency intensities found in music can mimic 
human life =xperiences and all the stimulating associations that come with it. The sec=nd question therefore, is why 
does the human brain like to experience a du=lication of its experiences?
