RIN II • 094 Alpha Group Capital LLC 
transaction. The Regulations require a financial service provider to maintain certain anti•money laundering procedures 
including those for the purposes of verifying the identity and source of funds of an "applicant for business"; e.g. an investor. 
Except in certain circumstances, including where an entity is regulated by a recognized overseas regulatory authority and/or 
listed on a recognized stock exchange in an approved jurisdiction, the Issuer Administrator will likely be required to verify 
each investor's identity and the source of the payment used by such investor for purchasing the Preferred Shares in a 
manner similar to the obligations imposed under the laws of other major financial centers. In addition, if any person resident 
in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects, or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that another person is 
engaged in criminal conduct, or is involved with terrorism or terrorist property, and the information for that knowledge or 
suspicion came to their attention in the course of business in the regulated sector, or other trade, profession, business or 
employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to (i) the FRA, pursuant to the PCL, if the 
disclosure relates to criminal conduct or money laundering, or (ii) a police officer of the rank of constable or higher, or the 
FRA, pursuant to the Terrorism Law (2015 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with 
terrorism or terrorist financing and property. If the Issuer were determined by the Cayman Islands authorities to be in 
violation of the PCL, the Terrorism Law or the Regulations, the Issuer could be subject to substantial criminal penalties. The 
Issuer may be subject to similar restrictions in other jurisdictions. Such a violation could materially adversely affect the 
timing and amount of payments by the Issuer to the Preferred Shareholders. 
European Risk Retention 
Prospective purchasers of Preferred Shares should be aware of the EU risk retention and due diligence requirements (the 
"EU Risk Retention Rules") which currently apply, or are expected to apply in the future, in respect of various types of EU 
regulated investors including credit institutions, authorised alternative investment fund managers, investment firms, 
insurance and reinsurance undertakings, UCITS funds and institutions for occupational retirement provision. Amongst other 
things, such requirements restrict a relevant investor from investing in asset-backed securities unless (i) that investor is able 
to demonstrate that it has undertaken certain due diligence in respect of various matters including its note position, the 
underlying assets and (in the case of certain types of investors) the relevant sponsor or originator and (ii) the originator, 
sponsor or original lender in respect of the relevant securitisation has explicitly disclosed to the investor that it will retain, on 
an on-going basis, a net economic interest of not less than five % in respect of certain specified credit risk tranches or asset 
exposures. Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of 
those investors subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a penal capital charge on the Preferred Shares 
acquired by the relevant investor. Aspects of the requirements and what is or will be required to demonstrate compliance to 
national regulators remain unclear. 
The EU Risk Retention Rules described above apply, or are expected to apply, in respect of the Preferred Shares. Relevant 
investors are required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of the information described above for the 
purposes of complying with any relevant requirements and none of the Issuer, the Portfolio Advisor, the Placement Agents, 
the Security Party, the Portfolio Administrator, the Retention Holder, their respective affiliates or any other Person makes 
any representation that the information described above is sufficient in all circumstances for such purposes. 
It should be noted that the European authorities have adopted and finalised two new regulations related to securitisation 
(being Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 and Regulation (EU) 2017/2401) which will apply in general from January 1, 2019. 
Among other things, the regulations include provisions intended to implement the revised securitisation framework 
developed by BCBS (with adjustments) and provisions intended to harmonise and replace the risk retention and due 
diligence requirements (including the corresponding guidance provided through technical standards) applicable to certain 
EU regulated investors. There are material differences between the coming new requirements and the current requirements 
including with respect to the matters to be verified under the due diligence requirements, as well as with respect to the 
application approach under the retention requirements and the originator entities eligible to retain the required interest.
