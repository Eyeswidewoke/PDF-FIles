889 F.3d 116, *; 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 11909, ** 
For example, the complaint alleges that consumers were "duped into believing" that the 
membership programs were being offered by an e-merchant, rather than Trilegiant, App'x 
at 282, but identifies no misrepresentation that induced such a belief. Similarly, the 
complaint labels datapass a "fraudulent tactic," id., and alleges that each time an e-
merchant shared a customer's billing information with Trilegiant, both the e-merchant and 
Trilegiant "committed an act of wire fraud," id. at 308. But the transfer of billing information 
from one merchant to another is not inherently fraudulent, and the plaintiffs do not identify 
any misrepresentation regarding such transfers by Trilegiant or any other defendant. 
[' 126] Neither the complaint's specific discussion of Trilegiant's allegedly deceptive 
tactics, r'in nor its conclusory references to Trilegiant's fraudulent scheme, set forth a 
material misrepresentation with the requisite particularity.' Cf. Webloyalty.com, 673 F. 
App'x at 104 (concluding that Trilegiant's practices at issue in that case not "sufficient to 
ground [a] fraud claim"). The complaint therefore fails to plead a scheme to defraud. 
Without an underlying scheme to defraud, the plaintiffs have not alleged a pattern of 
racketeering. 
7 Plaintiffs also rely on Delgado v. Ocwen Loan Servicing for the proposition that the Trilegiant's tactics as alleged are 
sufficiently deceptive to qualify as a material misrepresentation. In Delgado. the defendant mailed checks for small amounts of 
free money together with materials separately disclosing that deposit of the check registers the recipient for an (unwanted and 
unrelated) service at a steep monthly fee. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135758. 2014 WL 4773991, at '1.2. The Delgado plaintiffs 
complaint alleged specific material omissions and misrepresentations as to the source of the charges. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
135758. IWLI at '18-19. Delgado accurately distinguished the Trilegiant scheme in which "the plaintiffs claimed they were 
deceptively enrolled in membership programs through the defendants internet offer pages" but failed to describe any false or 
fraudulent content. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135758, [INLJ at '18. 
The plaintiffs' RICO conspiracy claim fails as well. The alleged conspiracy involved an 
agreement to commit the same substantive RICO violations we have deemed insufficiently 
pled, and the plaintiffs have not alleged any further acts that, if carried out, would have 
satisfied RICO's requirement of a pattern of racketeering. See generally Salinas v. United 
States, 522 U.S. 52, 118 S. Ct. 469, 139 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1997). The plaintiffs therefore 
failed to plead the necessary agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. See 
Cofacredit S.A. v. Windsor Plumbing Supply Co., 187 F.3d 229, 245 (2d Cir. 1999). 
IV 
Finally, we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the CUTPA and unjust enrichment 
claims substantially for the reasons set forth by the district court. 
[HN11] CUTPA prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade 
or commerce." Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 42-110b(a). The plaintiffs allege that Trilegiant's 
risi refund mitigation strategy caused them to lose a portion of a possible refund of 
membership fees. But the plaintiffs, who consented to their original enrollment, have not 
shown that they are entitled to any such refund. The fact that some plaintiffs were offered 
less than a full refund to which they would not have been entitled at law cannot constitute 
an "unfair or deceptive" act. 
The district court was likewise correct in granting summary judgment on the unjust 
enrichment claim. An unjust enrichment claim for membership fees does not lie if the
