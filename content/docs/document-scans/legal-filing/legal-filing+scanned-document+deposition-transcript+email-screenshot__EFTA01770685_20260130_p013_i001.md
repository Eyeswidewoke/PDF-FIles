even impinge on Russia's presidential elections= giving a boost to Vladimir Putin's ambitions. Ever since his historic v=sit 
to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf in 2007 -- the first ever by a Russian leader -- Putin has claimed to know ho= to handle 
Middle East affairs. 
The situation in Syria is a subject of great preoccupation in Moscow. Deput= Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov was very 
firm, issuing what seemed like=a warning to the Western powers: "Russia cannot tolerate open interventi=n on one side 
of the conflict," he thundered. It was wrong to force Bashar al-Asad, "the President of a sov=reign state" to step down. 
Russia was seeking to institute a dialogue wi=hout preconditions. It was continuing its contacts with the opposition. Bu=, 
in the meantime, he cautioned, the opposition had to dissociate itself from extremists. 
In thinking about Syria, the Russians are clearly much influenced by what h=ppened in Libya. The Western powers, 
Bogdanov charged, had made many mista=es in the violent overthrow of Qadhafi. "There is a need," he insisted= "to 
investigate the civilian casualties caused by NATO airstrikes." Professor Naumkin explained: "Russia feels=that it was 
cheated by its international partners. The no-fly zone mandate=in Libya was transformed into direct military 
intervention. This should no= be repeated in Syria." Arming the opposition would only serve to increase the killing. There 
was now the thrrat of civil war. Reforms had to be given a chance. The majority of the Syr=an population did not want 
Bashar al-Asad to stand down. External armed fo=ces should not intervene. 
Although Naumkin did not say so, there were rumours at the conference that =ussia had advised Asad on the drafting of 
the new Syrian Constitution, whi=h strips the Ba'th Party of its monopoly as "leader of State and socie=y." The 
Constitution is due to be put to a referendum on 26 February, followed by multi-party elections. 
As was to be expected, several Arab delegates at the conference were critic=l of Russia's role in protecting President 
Asad, in particular of its ve=o on 4 February at the UN Security Council of the Resolution calling on hi= to step down. 
Professor Naumkin put up a vigorous defence. "We are seeking a new strategy of partnership=between Russia and the 
Arab world," he declared. "We are determined to=take up the challenge against those who do not respect our 
interests." H= stressed that Russia's interests in the Middle East were not mercantile. It had no special relations with 
anyone (=y this he seemed to mean the Asad family); it had no proxies or puppets in=the region. Russia was a young 
democracy. It listened to public opinion. 1= was defending its vision of international relations based on respect for the 
sovereignty of states and a rejection o= foreign armed intervention. 
Of all the Arabs present, it was the Palestinians who, not surprisingly, we=e most eager for Russian support in their 
unequal struggle with Israel. No= that Russia was returning to the international arena as a major player, t=ey called for it 
to put its full weight in favour of the peace process and of Mahmoud Abbas, "the last mo=erate Palestinian leader." 
America's monopoly of the peace process had=merely provided a cover for Israeli expansion. 
Speaker after speaker deplored the ineffective peace-making of the Quartet =the United States, European Union, Russia 
and UN). Indeed, an Israeli spea=er reminded the conference that the discovery of large gas reserves off th= Israeli coast 
meant that Israel -- soon to be "a major partner in the energy market" once gas started =o flow next year -- would be 
less motivated to talk peace. The world would=be confronted, he seemed to be saying, by a "Greater Israel with 
gas!"=br> Some Palestinians called for the toothless Quartet to be dismantled altoget=er and replaced by enhanced UN 
involvement. Some Israelis conceded that th=ir country had made strategic errors in expanding West Bank settlements 
an= laying siege to Gaza. Nevertheless, the Israel public had turned against the peace process, while the goal of =rime 
Minister Benyamin Netanyahu was to rule out the possibility of a two-state solution. This prompted Ambassador Andrey 
Baklanov to argue for the n=ed to re-launch a multilateral Middle East peace process to replace the failed bilateral talks. 
Indeed, perhaps the clearest message of the conference was the appeal for a=greater role for the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, 
India, China and South Africa)=in establishing a new multilateral mechanism for regional security. To hal= the killing in 
Syria or to ward off a U.S.-Israeli war against Iran, would Russia sponsor a mediation proc=ss in conjunction with its 
BRICS partners? Would it seek to revive the mor=bund Arab-Israeli peace process by sponsoring an international 
conference =n Moscow? These questions remained unanswered. 
Russia's ambition to play a greater role in international affairs is clea=. But can it deliver?
