balance method (including new transactions). To get the "average daily balance' 
we take the beginning balance of each day, and, as applicable to that balance.add 
any new charges and fees. and subtract any paymentsor credits. This gives us the 
daily balance. We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide by 
the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the "averagedaily balance.' 
We multiplythe applicablemonthly periodic rate by the -averagedaily balancesand 
that gives us the interest charges for that balance for the billing cycle. (The 
monthly periodic rate equals the APR in effect divided by 12.)

after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you interest on Purchases if 
you pay your entire balance by the payment due date. 
Variable APRs: APRs followed by (V) may vary. 
Payment: You may pay all or part of your account balance at any time. However. 
you must pay, by the payment due date, at least the minimum payment due.
