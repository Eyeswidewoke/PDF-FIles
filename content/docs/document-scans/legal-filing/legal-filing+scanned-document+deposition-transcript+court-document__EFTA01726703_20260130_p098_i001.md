Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC):We use the Average 
Daily Balance method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Aotount by applying 
the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as deserted below) for each feature (such as Purchase,-Cmh 
Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (including current transactions). To get the Average Daily 
Balance br each feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid FC from previous 
billing periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any 
appropriate a ustments. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also add an amount of 
interest equ 
to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the daily periodic rate for the feature. 
This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the Wginning balance for the feature for the next day. II this 
balance is negative it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all Me daily balances for the feature for the billing period 
and dvide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average Daily Balance for the feature. For 
all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Feennce will be considered to be zero it you 
paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the Payment Due Date shown on that 
statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number of days In the billing period and the 
daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that feature, except for variations caused
rounding. The total FC for the billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all features of the Account. 7hIS 
method of calculating the Average D* Balance and FC results In daily compounding of FC. The minimum 
FC fore any
e:  billingff  riod in which FC are imposed is $0.50.
