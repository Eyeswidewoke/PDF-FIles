The National Interest 
The Continent's Nightmare Continues 
Doug Bandow <http://nationalinterest.org/profile/doug-bandow> 
February 22, 2012 -- Two years ago, the Lisbon Treaty created a stronger, more powerful European Union with a 
president and foreign minister. The continent seemed to have answered Henry Kissinger's derisive question: What is the 
phone number for Europe? But it still isn't clear who will answer. Europe is the world's most important economic 
aggregation. The Continent hosts several of the world's most venerable democracies. Europe's historical and cultural 
ties circle the globe. However, the EU has failed to live up to the lofty ambitions of the Eurocrats, the business, political, 
bureaucratic and academic elites who dominate continental politics and policy. Europe remains a geographic 
conglomeration, not a political unit. 
While the common economic market is huge, the continent isn't functioning very well as an economic collaboration. 
Moreover, there is no common foreign policy, let alone a unified military. Most European politicians advocate further 
political consolidation in Brussels but disagree on the specific form. The European public seems increasingly skeptical of 
what the European project has become. 
Euro on the Brink 
The EU's immediate challenge is preserving what unity it has achieved, most notably the euro zone. As Greece inched 
toward another bailout, violent protests against the unity government's further cutbacks engulfed Athens. Private 
creditors continue to resist baptizing Greece's de facto default, while official creditors continue to resist accepting any 
losses. Earlier this week, after withholding approval of aid to Greece while seeking greater budget cutbacks and political 
assurances by Athens, European Union officials approved a $170 billion second bailout. Nevertheless, European Union 
negotiators withheld final approval of aid to Greece while seeking greater budget cutbacks and political assurances by 
Athens. Many continental analysts and political leaders believe that an official Greek default is inevitable. The only 
question is whether Athens could then retain the euro; increasingly Greece's neighbors aren't interested in the answer. 
Worse, efforts to contain the crisis so far have failed. Moody's recently downgraded Portugal, which may be heading 
toward a Greek-style crash. The agency reduced ratings for Spain and Italy as well and cut the outlook for France and 
Great Britain. Refinancing existing debt will be more difficult as global investors back away from European securities, 
creating "a pretty terrible spiral," observed Peter R. Fisher of asset manager 8lackRock. And every new EU bailout 
further burdens already heavily indebted states. Help is not likely to come from overseas. The Europeans hoped their 
bailout fund would attract private investors and foreign nations, including China, but no one wants to toss their good 
money after Europe's bad investments. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) played a smaller role than expected, and 
the Europeans will pay much of that bill. No money will come from Washington, at least directly; Republicans already 
are targeting America's pending contribution to the IMF lest it be used to bail out the improvident Europeans. 
The Eurocrats' Nightmare 
Some Eurocrats fear the impact on the EU as well. If the euro zone shrinks—or, worse, collapses—expansion of the 
union and its authority will halt. The idea of a European nation-state will be moribund, if not formally buried. Tying 
Germany to its neighbors took on greater urgency after World War II. European cooperation proceeded through the 
common market, but political unification trailed far behind. So the Eurocrats launched an indirect approach. The euro 
zone's architects recognized the challenge of adopting a common monetary policy without a common budget policy, but 
they assumed economic policy and political institutions would follow. Thus was launched the Euro, adopted by 
seventeen of the EU's twenty-seven members. Now, explained German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe "must 
overcome the architectural flaws that worked their way into the economic and monetary union during its formation." 
The Lisbon Treaty began as a continental constitution which would expand Brussels' authority and reduce national
