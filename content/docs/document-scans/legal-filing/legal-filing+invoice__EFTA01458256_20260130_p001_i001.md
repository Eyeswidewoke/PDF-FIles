Performance since initiation 
O 
U.S. leisure-and-entertainment 
stocks have started catching 
tip with the broader U.S. 
equity market over the last 
few months and we believe 
that this trend may continue. 
Overall U.S. retail sales 
improved in July with, for 
example, sales at food services 
and drinking places up 9% on 
a year earlier. The apparent 
preference for leisure-and-
entertainment spending - over 
that of goods- is reflected in 
higher consensus earnings 
expectations for this sector.

Performance since initiation 
The performance of this 
idea worsened in July and 
August. However, despite 
concerns about the impact 
of low oil prices on energy-
sector borrowers, overall U.S. 
high-yield default rates are still 
expected by Moody's to rise 
only modestly over the coming 
year.: Issuers appear to have 
largely financed maturities into 
2017 and beyond. European 
high-yield - where energy-
sector borrowers are much 
less important - may be more 
appealing over a medium-term 
time horizon.

Performance !arm initiation 
U.S. consumer-discretionary 
stocks should be supported 
by the following three factors. 
First, lower commodity - and 
in particular oil prices. The 
general rule of thumb is that 
every 50.01 fall in gasoline 
prices adds around $t billion 
to consumer spending power. 
Second, the U.S labor market 
continues to improve and 
there are further signs of a 
resumption of wage growth. 
Third, consumer confidence 
remains strong. Overall U.S. 
retail sales were 2.4% higher in 
July than a year earlier, in U.S. 
dollar terms. 
' On June 5, 2015, the Bundesbank predicted 1.5% GDP growth for the full year 20t5, after 1.4% 
for the first half.
