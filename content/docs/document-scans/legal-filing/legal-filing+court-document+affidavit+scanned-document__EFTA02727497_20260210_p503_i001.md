Customer further covenants that: (a) Components and other parts and equipment for the 
applicable Helicopter shall be properly installed; (b) the Components and the applicable 
Helicopter shall be operated and maintained in accordance with the then-current 
recommendations or instructions of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, as contained in its 
maintenance manuals, operating instructions, Alert Service Bulletins or as otherwise stated in 
writing by a duly authorized representative of Sikorsky or Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation; (c) 
Components shall not be repaired or overhauled by anyone other than Sikorsky without 
Sikorsky's prior written authorization; and (d) a Helicopter shall not be used for any service 
other than transport, including but not limited to for Repetitive External Lift, which results or 
may result in substantially greater wear and tear of any Component than that which occurs on 
Components under standard transport operating conditions. 
Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer is responsible for complying with all 
scheduled inspections and other maintenance tasks set forth in the maintenance manuals, 
operating instructions, Alert Service Bulletins, and other documentation issued by Sikorsky or 
Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation with respect to maintaining the Components and the applicable 
Helicopter. Customer shall ensure that reasonable and commercially customary maintenance 
efforts are made to troubleshoot and fix/adjust Components prior to requesting a replacement. 
5. Metal Contamination - Customer shall immediately report Component failure due to metal 
contamination to Sikorsky, and shall comply with Sikorsky's requests for supporting data 
and/or samples. 
6. Removal of Components - Customer shall not remove a Component from a Helicopter prior 
to its TB0 without prior authorization from the Sikorsky Point of Contact for Program Matters 
identified in Article I (or such individual's successor or delegate). 
7. New Helicopter Warranty Waiver for S-76DTM Helicopters — In the case of a S-76DTM 
model helicopter, with respect to any Component installed at the time of acceptance of the 
Helicopter from Sikorsky or its affiliate, Customer waives the original helicopter warranty set 
forth in the Helicopter's sales agreement for such Component until such time as this Agreement 
is terminated or expires. In the event that this Agreement is terminated prior to the scheduled 
expiration of the original warranty set forth in such sales agreement, such original warranty for 
each Component will be reinstated and Customer shall be entitled only to the remaining or 
unexpired duration and terms of such original warranty in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the sales agreement. With respect to each Component, the provisions of this 
Agreement, while in effect, operate as a substitute for the original warranty for such 
Component waived. If Customer is not the only party with the right to exercise the original 
helicopter warranty, Customer shall provide Sikorsky with such party or parties' written 
waiver(s) of the original warranty promptly following the Acceptance Date.
