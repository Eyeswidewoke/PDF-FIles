Obama Administration and =rivate-sectors jobs have grown by more than 2.5 million, compared to the 7=0,000 jobs loss 
the month that President Obama took office.<=p> 
In an editorial this week in the New York Times 
The Economy Is Heading the Wrong Way — even those at The=Old 
Grey Lady believes that although at first glance, the latest economic growth report, released last =riday, appears to show 
the economy revving up, in reality, the economy is either s=uck in low gear, or worse, slowing to a stop as budget cuts 
harm not only the users of overstretched government ser=ices but the overall economy. And that this precarious 
situation urgently calls for more federal spending, not less, th=ugh that message has been lost on Congress, where the 
strategies to cut the bud=et have taken priority over strategies to increase growth, jobs and pay. =And please don't 
blame the Obama Administration, who have been doing everything in their power to both grow the economy and =atisfy 
the deficit hawks. But when you work at cross-purposes, often neither side is given proper justice due to compromis=s 
that water-down the strengths of their solutions. 
At the same time, cutbacks in government spending took a big chunk out of growth, reflecting, in part, the onset of 
automatic budget cut= under the sequester. The hit from lower public spending will only intensify in the quarters to 
come as the sequeste= takes full effect, threatening to push growth below its already paltry 2 percent average. There is 
a tendency, in the gloom, to look for bright spots. Housing, for example, showed continued growth in the first quarter, 
but it was more than offset b= the drag from cuts in government spending. But if overall growth remains sluggish or 
even slows down, it could overwhelm the housing recovery, because the pace of home sales is inseparab=e from the 
pace of the economy. Without enough growth to power jobs and pay, potential homeowners will simply not h=ve the 
income and credit profiles to buy. 
Republicans have insisted on austerity for ideological and political reasons. And to counter government cuts the 
administration has added new taxes and made inves=ments, but the reductions (especially on state and local levels with 
teachers, police, firefighter=, social programs) have result in deep cuts and damaging local communitie=. Still the 
budget fights continue even though the intellectual arguments for near-=erm deficit reduction have collapsed. They 
have endured even as the economies that have enforced budget cuts most strenuously have contracted, notably in 
Britain and in much of the rest of Europe. And they endure even as the United States remains impaired by fiscal wounds 
that are, unfortunately and undeniably, self-inflicted. Hopefully now that the New York Times Editorial Board has joined 
the growing n=mber of prominent economist and think-tanks, publicly saying that au=terity is the wrong direction, our 
politicians in Washington will finally get the message. 
Now that austerity has=been debunked as the economic solution to the current recession, with most economist 
agreeing that the be=t way for us to get out of our current economic malaise is to promote program= that directly create 
jobs — with this in mind this week l=have included an Washington Post article by Deputy Assistant Secretary 
Commerce fr=m 2009 to 2011, Ro Khanna — Five myths about manufacturing jobs, to address the five biggest 
misconc=ptions about U.S. manufacturing — and why the sector still matte=s. Lets start with the fact that the United 
States remains a world leader in manufacturing, and that sector remains essential to our economic and technological 
future. 
There is no doubt that America's manufacturing base has declined, peaking at 19.6 million jobs in 1979 and now at just 
over 11 mill=on jobs. Despite this economic transition, U.S. manufacturing jobs are s=ill worth having. On average, full-
time manufacturing work pays 20 percent more than full-time service-sector jobs.= Example, electronic technicians with 
only a high school diploma can rise through the ranks of manufacturing companies to ear= more than $100,000 a year. 
Whereas, high school grads in retail or service-sector jobs rarely reach six figures. 
Andy Grove, the former chief executive of Intel, has famously argued that the best innovation takes place when design 
teams are integrated with production teams. Product designers can get feedback about =he practical constraints
