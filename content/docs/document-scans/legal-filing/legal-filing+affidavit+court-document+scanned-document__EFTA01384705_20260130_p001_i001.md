HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
determining the price or value of an Underlying Fund's assets or liabilities, or of current prices in 
any stock market as aforesaid, or when, for any other reason, the prices or values of any assets or 
liabilities of an Underlying Fund cannot reasonably be promptly and accurately ascertained; (iv) 
during any period when the transfer of funds involved in the realization or acquisition of any 
investments cannot, in the opinion of the General Partner, be effected at normal rates of exchange 
or (v) when the Partnership is being dissolved. Upon the determination by the General Partner 
that any of the above-mentioned conditions no longer applies, withdrawal rights will be promptly 
reinstated, and any pending withdrawal requests will be honored as of the end of the fiscal quarter 
following such determination. 
Limited Partners that first acquired their Interests on or prior to October 1, 2012 (and a 
Related Investor of any such Limited Partner, even if the Related Investor acquired its interests in 
the Funds after October 1, 2012) under certain circumstances as set forth below may withdraw 
Interests in excess of the Applicable Percentage. If withdrawal requests are received for any 
Withdrawal Date with respect to interests in the Funds having an aggregate net asset value of not 
more than 4% of the net asset value of the Master Fund as of such date (excluding the value of 
additional subscription amounts, if any, received as of the next day following such Withdrawal 
Date), a withdrawing Limited Partner that has requested to withdraw its Applicable Percentage 
also may elect to withdraw up to its pro rata share of the difference between 4% of the Master 
Fund's net asset value and the aggregate net asset value of the interests being withdrawn (the "4% 
Excess"). A Limited Partner's pro rata share in the 4% Excess will be based upon the value of its 
Interest, after giving effect to the withdrawal requests for the relevant Withdrawal Date (with 
Related Investors being considered a single investor for these purposes). A Limited Partner 
electing this option will have 0.75% of the amount withdrawn in excess of the Applicable 
Percentage retained by the Partnership. The 0.75% amount that is retained by the Partnership will 
be allocated mm rata to the Partners based upon remaining Interests. New subscriptions received 
as of the first day following such Withdrawal Date will not be taken into account for purposes of 
allocating the 0.75% amount. 
If a Limited Partner desires to withdraw more than the Applicable Percentage, such Limited 
Partner will be required to submit a separate withdrawal notice for the next Withdrawal Date as of 
which it wishes to withdraw the additional amount. Subsequent withdrawal requests will not be 
entitled to any priority on subsequent Withdrawal Dates and will be further subject to the 
Applicable Percentage and any other applicable limitation. 
The Applicable Percentage will not apply to a withdrawal made by a Limited Partner to 
the extent that such withdrawal is offset by capital contributions from such Limited Partner or any 
Related Investor (as defined below) (each such capital contribution, an "Offsetting Contribution") 
accepted by the Partnership (and, unless the General Partner determines otherwise, by the Offshore 
Fund, the Levered Fund, or any other fund that invests most of its capital in the Master Fund and/or 
one or more Trading Vehicles) as of either (i) the beginning of the calendar month ending with the 
proposed Withdrawal Date or (ii) the beginning of either of the two calendar months immediately 
following the proposed Withdrawal Date; provided that in such case, an executed subscription 
agreement, identified by the withdrawing Limited Partner, as well as by the Related Investor 
making such capital contribution, as an Offsetting Contribution, is received and accepted by the 
Partnership no later than such Withdrawal Date.
