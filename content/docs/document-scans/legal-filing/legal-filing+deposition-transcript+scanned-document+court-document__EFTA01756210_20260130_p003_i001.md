October 17, 2013 -- Does the Middle East really matter anymore? 
I'm just kidding. Of course the Middle East matters. Just look at the headl=nes: Not a day goes by without a new crisis in 
Syria, Iraq, or Egypt or a =tatement by an Israeli politician or Iranian mullah predicting that we're =eaded either to war or 
peace. This week, world leaders met in Geneva to di=cuss Iran's nuclear capability. Last month, President Barack Obama 
gave a =peech to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) devoted entirely to th= Middle East. Then there are the 
petroleum reserves, the iconic Suez Canal= and the all too narrow Straits of Hormuz. There's also the never-ending s=ga 
of the Arab-Israeli conflict and, of course, September 11. That terribl= event -- the second bloodiest day in U.S. history, 
exceeded only by a day=during the Battle of Antietam -- came from the angry, grievance-producing,=broken Middle 
East. 
But, with all that said, the Middle East is not nearly as important as it u=ed to be. The traditional reasons for U.S. 
involvement are changing. Once =pon a time, it was all about containing the Russians, our dangerous depend=nce on 
Arab oil, and a very vulnerable Israel. Then it was all about the t=reat of Islamic extremism and terrorism, and the desire 
to nation-build in=Afghanistan and Iraq. 
Much of that is now gone. Some of what remains has gotten more complex and =imited the role the United States can 
and should play in the Middle East. =n other matters, the fact that some situations have gotten simpler may act=ally be 
further limiting what America wants and needs to accomplish there. 
Could it be that, in coming years, we're going draw back even more from the=place? Perhaps. And here's why. 
(1) There's no new cold war or bogeyman. 
It was the famous trio of Russians, oil, and Israel against the backdrop of=a declining British empire that brought the 
United States to the Middle Ea=t in there first place, and some would like to believe there's still a col= war on. After all, 
Putin loves to stick it to America every chance he get=, and he's seen the United States remove Russian clients one by 
one (Sadda= Hussein, Muammar Qaddafi) and even threaten unilateral action against Bas=ar al-Assad, Moscow's last 
man standing in the Middle East. 
But Putin is not interested in an expanded proxy war with Washington in a r=gion he knows is rife with Islamic 
extremism and a messy trap for Russia t= boot. He would like to preserve the influence and assets he has, some of =hich 
involve billions in unpaid Syrian debt and contracts with Assad's nam= on them, as well as the naval base at Tartus. Putin 
also opposes a Pax Am=rica. However, as the recent U.S.-Russian framework agreement on Syrian ch=mical weapons 
reveals, Putin's aims can involve cooperation as much as com=etition. As part of the PS +1, I also suspect Putin would 
sign on to a dea= on the Iranian nuclear issue, rather than risk Israeli or U.S. military a=tion. 
In other words, the Russians and the Americans are hardly allies in the Mid=le East -- but they're not quite enemies 
either. 
So, if the Russians aren't the principal threat to draw the United States i=to the region anymore, who or what is? In the 
wake of the collapse of the =oviet Union, a lot of smart people had questions about what new organizing=paradigm for 
U.S. foreign policy would replace the Cold War. After a decad=, the answer came literally out of the blue on a beautiful 
but deadly fall=day in September 2001. 
The attacks on the Pentagon and the Twin Towers generated a frenzy of activ=ty, much of it focused on the Middle East. 
This would come to include two =f the longest and among the most profitless wars in U.S. history, a global=war on 
terrorism, an industrial-size homeland security complex, and a cont=nuing struggle to find the right balance between 
America's security and th= rights, privacy, and civil liberties of its citizenry. 
But, another decade later, the signs of retrenchment and withdrawal from th= hot wars that replaced the cold one are 
pretty clear. We're out of Iraq, =nd, by 2014, we'll be heading for the exits in Afghanistan, too. As for th= so-called war 
on terrorism, we are getting smarter and more economical. T=e United States has been quite effective in dismantling al 
Qaeda's central=operations and keeping the homeland safe from another sensational attack. =e've been lucky for sure, 
but effective, too. The danger now appears to be=more from extremist-inspired, lone wolf episodes like we saw at Fort 
Hood =nd in Boston. In any event, Americans dying in terrorist attacks remains a= unlikely situation: Last year, only 10 
Americans died in terrorist attack=. You're more likely to die in a car accident. 
Meanwhile, drones are hardly an ideal counter-terrorism strategy from a leg=l, moral, or political point of view, but, 
along with the use of U.S. Spec=al Forces, they do reflect a much lower-profile approach to dealing with t=rrorists than 
invading nations and trying to rebuild them. Ideal or not, t=ese kinds of tactics reflect the sort of retail approach to 
terrorism that=the United States is likely to continue pursuing in the future.
