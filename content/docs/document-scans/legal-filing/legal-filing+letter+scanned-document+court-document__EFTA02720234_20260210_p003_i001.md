Fwd Monitor-
The new monitor is manufactured by UTC Aerospace Systems (Audio International Decrane), one of the 
nation's largest providers of in-flight entertainment systems for business aircraft. 
Although there were other aviation manufacturer's to choose from, we believe that UTC was the best 
choice. 
Prior to purchasing this monitor, we consulted with engineers at UTC to find the best solution to 
coordinate and integrate into the existing aircraft Cabin Management and aircraft systems. 
I spoke to Mike Hill (Cabin Electronics Technology Manager at UTC) at length yesterday and asked him 
to put our conversation into writing (see below). Should you wish to speak to Mike, I can coordinate a 
conference call. 
Hello Eric, 
Thank you for your time on the phone today. I put together a spread sheet comparing our 17" wide LCD 
to Rosen, ACS, and Flight Displays. Rosen doesn't appear to have a wide (16:9 resolution) 17" LCD, only 
a standard format (4:3 resolution) LCD. 
ACS and Flight Displays both have wide 17" LCDs. ACS specs are identical to ours, so I believe they're 
using the same raw 17" LCD panel as we am. 
Flight Displays does not list any real specifications in their spec sheet, i.e. no brightness or contrast ratio 
specs and I question their spec on the native resolution of the LCD. I have not seen any 17" LCDs with 
full High Definition resolution (1920 x 1080). I believe they can accept and display a 1080 video signal, so 
I would ask them for specifications off the data sheet for the LCD panel they are using. 
Our 17" wide LCD monitor has inputs to support standard definition analog composite video and SMPTE-
259 SDI video signals. In addition, we can accept VGA computer graphics or 1080i High Definition analog 
component (YPbPr) video signals on the VGA input, which would allow your current LCD to display HD 
video signals. The SDI video input will provide a slightly better picture over analog video, and of course 
an analog HD component video signal will provide a much better quality picture over the composite and 
SW inputs. 
We use a state of the art video processor that will upscale standard def video to meet the native 
resolution of the LCD panel. It utilizes an adaptive 5-line comb filter and an embedded 3D comb filter for 
NTSC/PAL video signals. It provides Video Enhancement features such as 5-axis color control and full 
10-bit data processing. It provides for enhanced low-motion detection and per-pixel 3D noise reduction, 
along with improved low-and high-angle interpolation. I know all of this probably sounds Greek to you, but 
suffice it to say, we use the best video processor in the market and it is the same processor used in many 
of the commercially available television sets today. We are fortunate to have had a long relationship with 
this IC manufacturer, which provides us access to their technology even though we are a low volume 
customer. That is unusual in today's consumer electronics driven market. 
For aircraft use, our products must undergo certification testing that impacts the cost of the final unit. You 
can't Just buy a commercial television monitor and install that on an aircraft. With that in mind, I believe we 
have the best 17" wide screen LCD in the market and we will work with you to obtain the best picture 
quality from the currently installed unit. 
Please find the LCD comparison below.
