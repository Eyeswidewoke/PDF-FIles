neo-Nazi group called the Atomwaffen Division, that works toward "ushering in the collapse of civilization," 
according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. He was previously sentenced to five years in prison after pleading 
guilty to possession of an unregistered destruction device and the improper storage of explosive materials. The

The Man Charged With Stabbing Salman Rushdie is Going On Trial 
The Associated Press (02/04, Thompson) reported that in 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture 
before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author's 
hand as he raised it in self-defense. "After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, 
everywhere," Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. "I feel my legs give way, and I fall." In the coming weeks, 
Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses 
in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar. Jury selection got underway Tuesday. 
Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault. The article 
mentioned that five jurors were seated during the first day of screening, which was scheduled to continue 
Wednesday. Under different circumstances, Rushdie's book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, 
might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his 
hand permanently damaged. But "this isn't a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley," said 
Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. "This is something that was 
recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people." Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as photos 
and documentation, and an estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand. Judge David Foley said once 
jury selection is complete, the trial would take up to a week and a half. The Guardian (02/04, Staff Writer), 
Aljazeera (02/04, Staff Writer), BBC (02/04, Cursino), Washington Post (02/04, Higgins), New York Post (02/04, 
Vago, Janoski), New York Daily News (02/04, Wilkinson), and UPI (02/04, Heuer) also reported on the story. 
Trump Names Washington's Joe Kent to Lead Counterterrorism Agency 
KZJO (Fox-13) (02/04, Cornfield) reported that President Donald Trump has nominated Joe Kent, a former Army 
Special Forces soldier and two-time Republican congressional candidate, to be the director of the National 
Counterterrorism Center, pending Senate confirmation. Kent, who has a background in military and intelligence 
operations, lost two congressional bids against Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and has faced scrutiny 
for his links to far-right groups and election conspiracy theories. The nomination has sparked mixed reactions, with 
Washington state Democratic Party chair Shasti Conrad criticizing the choice, while Washington state Republican 
Party chair Jim Walsh praised it. KULR (NBC-8) (02/04, Staff Writer), MSNBC (02/04, Benen), Mother Jones (02/04, 
Lanard), KGW (NBC-8) (02/04, Video), and the Times of Israel (02/05, Fard) also reported on the story. 
Trump Says He's Given Advisers Instructions for Iran to Be 'Obliterated' if It Assassinates Him 
The Associated Press (02/04, Price, Madhani, Miller) reported that President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's 
given his advisers instructions to obliterate Iran if it assassinates him. "If they did that they would be obliterated," 
Trump said in an exchange with reporters while signing an executive order calling for the U.S. government to 
impose maximum pressure on Tehran. "I've left instructions if they do it, they get obliterated, there won't be 
anything left." Federal authorities have been tracking Iranian threats against Trump and other administration 
officials for years. The article mentioned that Trump ordered the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the 
Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. A threat on Trump's life from Iran prompted additional 
security in the days before a July campaign rally in Pennsylvania where Trump was shot in the ear, according to U.S. 
officials. But officials at the time said they did not believe Iran was connected to that assassination attempt. The 
DOJ announced in November that an Iranian plot to kill Trump before the presidential election had been 
thwarted. The department alleged Iranian officials had instructed Farhad Shakeri, 51, in September to focus on 
surveilling and ultimately assassinating Trump. Shakeri is still at large in Iran. Iranian officials, at the time, dismissed 
the allegation, with foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei calling the report a plot by Israel-linked circles to 
make Iran-U.S. relations more complicated. Investigators were told of the plan to kill Trump by Shakeri, an accused 
Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery and who authorities say maintained a 
network of criminal associates enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots, according to the 
complaint. The article added that Shakeri, an Afghan national living in Iran, told the FBI that a contact in Iran's 
paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed him last September to set aside other work he was doing and 
assemble a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately kill Trump, according to a criminal complaint unsealed
