"unrecaptured Section 1250 gains, would have been treated as ordinary income on depreciation 
recapture if the property were "Section 1245 property." The foregoing rates do not include the 
medicare tax discussed below. With respect to distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends 
and any retained capital gain that we are deemed to distribute, we generally may designate whether 
such a distribution is taxable to our non-corporate stockholders as long-term capital gains or 
unrecaptured Section 1250 gains. The IRS has the authority to prescribe, but has not yet prescribed, 
regulations that would apply a capital gain tax rate of 25% (which is generally higher than the 
long-term capital gain tax rates for non-corporate taxpayers) to a portion of capital gain realized by a 
non-corporate stockholder on the sale of REIT stock that would correspond to the REIT's 
"unrecaptured Section 1250 gain." In addition, the characterization of income as capital gain or 
ordinary income may affect the deductibility of capital losses. A non-corporate taxpayer may deduct 
capital losses not offset by capital gains against its ordinary income only up to a maximum annual 
amount of $3,000. A non-corporate taxpayer may carry forward unused capital losses indefinitely. A 
corporate taxpayer must pay tax on its net capital gain at ordinary corporate rates (currently up to 
35%). A corporate taxpayer can deduct capital losses only to the extent of capital gains, with unused 
losses being carried back three years and forward five years. 
If a U.S. stockholder recognizes a loss upon a subsequent disposition of our common stock in an 
amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold, it is possible that the provisions of certain Tteasury 
Regulations involving "reportable transactions" could apply, with a resulting requirement to separately 
disclose the loss generating transactions to the IRS. While these regulations arc directed towards "tax 
shelters," they are written quite broadly and apply to transactions that would not typically be 
considered tax shelters. Significant penalties apply for failure to comply with these requirements. You 
should consult your tax advisors concerning any possible disclosure obligation with respect to the 
receipt or disposition of our common stock or transactions that might be undertaken directly or 
indirectly by us. Moreover, you should be aware that we and other participants in transactions involving 
us (including our advisors) might be subject to disclosure or other requirements pursuant to these 
regulations. 
Medicare Tax. 
A U.S. person that is an individual is subject to a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (1) the U.S. person's 
"net investment income" for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. person's modified 
gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which currently is between $125,000 and 
$250,000, depending on the individual's circumstances). Estates and trusts that do not fall into a special 
class of trusts that is exempt from such tax are subject to the same 3.8% tax on the lesser of their 
undistributed net investment income and the excess of their adjusted gross income over a certain 
threshold. Net investment income generally includes dividends on our stock and gain from the sale of 
our stock. If you are a U.S. shareholder that is an individual, estate or trust, you are urged to consult 
your tax advisors regarding the applicability of this tax to your income and gains in respect of your 
investment in our common stock. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. 
We will report to our stockholders and to the IRS the amount of distributions we make during 
each calendar year and the amount of tax we withhold, if any. Under the backup withholding rules, a 
stockholder may be subject to backup withholding at a current rate of up to 28% with respect to 
distributions unless the holder: 
• is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and, when required, 
demonstrates this fact; or
