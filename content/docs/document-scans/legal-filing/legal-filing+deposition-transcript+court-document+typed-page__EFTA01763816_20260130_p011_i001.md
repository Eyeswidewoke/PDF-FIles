=hese, mitigating damage to ecosystem health and local populations, would b=nefit all parties concerned and thus 
facilitate further basin-wide coopera=ion. 
UP IN THE ARAL 
Another water basin=of concern is the Aral Sea, which is shared by Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Taj=kistan, 
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The basin consists of two major rivers, the Syr Darya and Amu Darya. During th= Soviet 
era, these two rivers were managed relatively effectively. The bre=k-up of the Soviet Union, however, ended that. The 
major dispute now is be=ween upstream Kyrgyzstan and downstream Uzbekistan over the Syr Darya. During the winter, 
Kyrgyzstan needs flowing=water to produce hydroelectricity whereas Uzbekistan needs to store water =o later irrigate 
cotton fields. 
The countries have =ade several attempts to resolve the dispute. In particular, downstream Uzb=kistan, which is 
rich in fuel and gas, has provided energy to Kyrgyzstan to compensate for keeping water in its large=reservoirs until the 
cotton-growing season. Such barter agreements, howeve=, have had limited success because they are easily 
manipulated. Downstream=states might deliver less fuel during a rainy year, claiming they need less water from 
upstream reservoir=, and upstream states might deliver less water in retaliation. Kyrgyzstan,=frustrated and desperate 
for energy in winter months, plans to build mega =ydro-electric plants in its territory. And another upstream state, 
Tajikistan, is likewise considering hydro-elec=ricity to satiate its own energy needs. Meanwhile, Uzbekistan is building 
=arge reservoirs. 
Although these plan= might make sense in the very near term, they are inefficient in the mediu= and long term 
because they don't solve the real needs of downstream states for large storage capacity to protect agai=st water 
variability across time. In fact, both Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan,=along with Kazakhstan, will see substantial increases in 
water variability=between now and 2050. And so, the need to share the benefits of existing large-capacity upstream 
reservoirs =nd coordinate water uses through strong and more efficient inter-state agr=ements is unavoidable. 
A stabilized Aral S=a basin would also benefit the United States. With its withdrawal from Afg=anistan, 
Washington has been courting Uzbekistan as a potential alternative ally and provider of stability in the region. T=e Uzbek 
government seems willing to host U.S. military bases and work as a=counter-weight to Russia. Kyrgyzstan is also an 
important regional player.=The Manas Air Base, the U.S. military installation near Bishkek, is an important transit point. 
The country is a=so working with the United States to battle drug trafficking and infiltrat=on of criminal and insurgent 
groups. Regional instability could disrupt an= of these strategic relationships. 
If the past is any =ndication, the world probably does not need to worry about impending water=wars. But they 
must recognize how tensions over water can easily fuel larger conflicts and distract states from other=important 
geopolitical and domestic priorities. Since formal inter-state i=stitutions are key to alleviating tensions over shared 
resources, it would=be wise, then, for the involved governments as well as the international community to negotiate 
sufficient=y robust agreements to deal with impending environmental change. Otherwise= freshwater will only further 
frustrate stability efforts in the world's v=latile regions.
