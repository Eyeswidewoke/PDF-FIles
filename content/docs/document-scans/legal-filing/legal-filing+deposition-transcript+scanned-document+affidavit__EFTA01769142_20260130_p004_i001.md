=span style="font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif&=uot;;color:#1F1F1F">In Islam, women have been 
prohibited from showing off t=eir beauty in order to attract men or cause fitna (upheaval or seditio=). Showing off one's 
physical attraction to men is a kind of fitna ....Rod if this love for beauty and members of the opposite sex is found 
some=here other than the framework of the family, the stability of the family wi=l be undermined. 
Interestingly, t=e word Khamenei employs against the potential unveiling of women -- fitna&n=sp;-- is the same 
word used to describe the opposition Green Movement that t=ok to the streets in the summer of 2009 to protest 
President Mahmoud Ahmadi=ejad's contested reelection. In other words, women's hair is itself see= as seditious and 
counterrevolutionary. Even so-called liberal politicians i= the Islamic Republic have long fixated on this issue. Abolhassan 
Bani-Sadr= Iran's first post-revolutionary president, who has spent the past three de=ades exiled in France, reportedly 
once asserted that women's hair has been s=ientifically proven to emit sexually enticing rays. (An Iranian satirist 
re=ponded with a cartoon showing a man inadvertently aroused while eating lunc= at his friend's home; the culprit 
turned out to be an errant strand of his=friend's wife's hair in the ghormeh sabzi <http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-
26/lifestyle=29264822_1_red-pepper-cannellini-beans-lemon> stew, an l=anian national dish.) 
OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, the wom=n of Iran's younger generation have increasingly pushed back and 
loosened t=eir veils, but any discussion of abolishing the veil altogether is not tole=ated by Khamenei. In addition to 
opposition toward the United States and Is=ael, the hijab is often considered one of the Islamic Republic's three 
rema=ning ideological pillars. "For Islamic Republic officials, the hijab has va=t symbolic importance; it is what holds up 
the dam, keeping all of Iranians= other demands for social freedoms at bay," says Azadeh Moaveni, an Iranian=American 
author <http://www.amazon.com/gp/entity/Azadeh-Moaveni/B00=K8749QPie=UTF8&tag=fopo-

=espite Khamenei's assertion that the hijab prevents men from straying, gove=nmental policies in fact 
encourage the opposite. For example, to help accom=odate the apparently incorrigibly wandering libido of the Iranian 
male, the=country's parliament -- composed of Khamenei loyalists -- has supported sha=ia-sanctioned "temporary 
marriages" (known in Persian as sigheh) allowing m=n as many sexual partners as they want. The marriage contract can 
last as I=ttle as a few minutes, and it doesn't need to be officially registered. The=man can abruptly end the sigheh when 
he likes, but initiating divorce is fa= more difficult for women. Indeed, women who stray from the sanctity of the=r 
marriages do so at grave risk -- dozens have been stoned to death in Iran=for adultery.

The country's economic malaise has als= led to a reportedly sharp rise in plain old, non-Islamically sanctioned 
pr=stitution. Tehran's high-end taxi drivers, often underemployed university g=aduates, casually point them out on the 
street. 
"When eco=omies take a downturn, informal economies and illicit networks become more a=tractive," says 
Pardis Mandavi, author of a book on sexuality in Iran
