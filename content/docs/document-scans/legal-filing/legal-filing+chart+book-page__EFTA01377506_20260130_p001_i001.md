Real Assets: Commodities 
— The weakness in commodities that has been 
seen over the past year continued this week as 
the Bloomberg Commodity Index fell to the 
lowest level since 2002. Additionally, as of July 
28, the Index has fallen 9.5% month to date, 
which is on pace to be the worst month since 
September 2011. 
— While the fall in energy, in particular crude oil 
(-19.3% month-to-date. MTD), has led the 
weakness, it is interesting to note that this Index 
decline is not just a crude oil story as all five 
commodities sectors are negative MTD. 
— Precious metals have declined as gold (-7% 
MTD) fell to the lowest level since 2010 as we 
move closer to the first Fed rate hike. 
— Additionally, as investors fear slowing global 
demand due to the slowdown in Chinese growth, 
industrial metals have also suffered. Copper 
(-8% MTD) fell to the lowest level since 2009 due 
to its sensitivity to China. 
— While commodities may stabilize in the near term 
from oversold levels, further US dollar strength 
could pose a continued headwind.

Data as of July 30. 2015. 
— The primary driver of the U.S. dollar going 
forward will be the market's perception of the 
timing and magnitude of eventual Fed rate hikes. 
— With the much anticipated Q2 GDP coming in 
relatively in line with expectations, the Fed can 
be optimistic that the acceleration is underway. 
— In the absence of a Fed meeting in August, any 
significant deviations from expectations in key 
economic data such as next week's payroll 
report (Friday), ISM report (Monday) and 
inflation data throughout the month could fuel 
volatility. 
— From a technical perspective the U.S. Dollar 
Index (DXY)* has been able to bounce above 
the 50 day moving average which may suggest 
this could be a near term support level. 
— Due to this, we expect the U.S. dollar to 
appreciate to parity against the euro and to 130 
against the Japanese yen by June 2016.
