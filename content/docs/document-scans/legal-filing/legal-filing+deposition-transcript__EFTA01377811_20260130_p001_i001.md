On August 21, 2015, the Company amended its payment processing agreement with Starbucks such that, as of October 1, 
2015, the Company is no longer Starbucks' exclusive payment processing provider. Starbucks can terminate the agreement upon 
30 days' prior notice, and any payment processing volumes will be subject to increased rates beginning on October 1, 2015. As 
part of this amendment, the previously unvested warrants related to processing targets in the United Kingdom and Japan have 
been canceled. Additionally, the Company agreed to facilitate the sale of 2,269,830 shares of Series D preferred stock owned by 
Starbucks to a third party. If the aggregate purchase price in a sale to a third party of the Series D preferred stock is less than $37 
million, then the Company will pay Starbucks the difference. This obligation terminates upon the expiration of any applicable lock-
up period following an initial public offering. In the event that such obligation has not terminated, and the shares have not been 
sold, by October 30, 2016, the Company is obligated to repurchase the shares for $37 million. The Company has designated this 
obligation as a derivative instrument initially valued at $1.5 million to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis (see Note 2). 
The liability has been included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
Stock Option Plan 
Under the 2009 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), shares of common stock are reserved for the issuance of incentive stock 
options (ISOs) or non-statutory stock options (NSOs) to eligible participants. The options may be granted at a price per share not 
less than the fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted generally vest over a four-year term from the date of grant, at 
a rate of 25% after one year, then monthly on a straight-line basis thereafter. Generally, options granted are exercisable for up to 
10 years from the date of grant. The Plan allows for early exercise of employee stock options whereby the option holder is allowed 
to exercise prior to vesting. Any unvested shares are subject to repurchase by the Company at their original exercise prices. 
Common shares purchased under the Plan are subject to certain restrictions, including the right of first refusal by the 
Company for sale or transfer of shares to outside parties. The Company's right of first refusal terninates upon completion of an 
initial public offering of common stock. 
As of December 31, 2014. the Plan authorized 133,592,790 shares of common stock to be reserved for issuance on the 
exercise of stock options to purchase common stock, of which the right to purchase 4,535.900 shares remains available for 
issuance. As of September 30, 2015, the Plan authorized 162,561,028 shares of common stock to be reserved for issuance on the 
exercise of stock options to purchase common stock, of which the right to purchase 10.402.882 shares remains available for 
issuance. 
In January 2015, the Company's Chief Executive Officer contributed 5,068,238 shares of common stock back to the 
Company for no consideration. The purpose of the contribution was to retire such shares in order to offset stock ownership dilution 
to existing investors in connection with future issuances under the 2009 Stock Plan.
