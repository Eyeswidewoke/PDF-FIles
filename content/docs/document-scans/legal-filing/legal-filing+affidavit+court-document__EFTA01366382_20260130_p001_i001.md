of our initial business combination. The fee will only be payable upon closing of our initial business combination. 
and may be paid out of the offering proceeds deposited in the trust arnsint. The per-sham amount distributed to 
any redeeming stockholders upon the completion of our initial business combination will not be reduced as a 
result of such fee. A majority of disinterested directors win detennine the nature and amount of such fee, which 
will be based upon the prevailing market rate for similar services negotiated at alms' length for such transactions 
at such time, but will in no event exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate. Any such fee will also be subject to the 
review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee's policies and procedures relating to transactions 
that may present conflicts of interest. No such fee will be payable to our Chief Executive Officer. 
Our sponsor. executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target 
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a 
quarterly basis all payments that were made 
117 
to our sponsor. officers. directors or our or their affiliates and will detennine which expenses and the amount of 
expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 
As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us $225,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses 
of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing. unsecured and are due at the earlier of Ikeember 31, 2015 
or the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the estimated 
$750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses. The value of our 
sponsor's interest in this transaction corresponds to the principal amount outstanding under any such loan. 
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, 
our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers, directors and director nominees may, but arc 
not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we would 
repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close. we may use a portion 
of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust 
account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500.000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of 
the post business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would 
be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holder. The terms of such loans by our officers. 
directors and director nominees, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to 
such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we 
do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to 
seek access to funds in our trust account. 
After our initial business combination. members of our management team who remain with us may be paid 
consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed 
to our stockholders, to the extent then known. in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials. as applicable. 
furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of 
distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial 
business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine 
executive and director compensation. 
We have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the founder shares and private placement 
warrants, which is described under the heading "Principal Stockholders—Registration Rights."
