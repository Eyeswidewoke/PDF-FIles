Amendment No. 3 to Form S-I 
Table of Contents 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to grow that aspect of our business. We have added group sales managers at most 
restaurants and introduced large group reception and meeting packages, which have generated significant momentum in group sales 
growth. In Fiscal 2014, we generated large group sales growth of 12.8% for our comparable restaurants over the prior year period, and 
we believe the investments we have made in our group sales business will continue to yield positive results. 
Continue to Improve Our Marketing to Drive Traffic. We will continue to invest in marketing and advertising to drive guest trial and 
frequency. We continue to introduce new marketing initiatives through various channels, including social, online, print, digital 
advertising. TV and radio media, with the intent to promote brand awareness. We will continue to harness word of mouth and grow our 
social media and c-mail marketing fan base through thoughtful planning, unique promotions and rich content that reward loyalty and 
increase guest engagement with our brand. We intend to drive repeat traffic by becoming our guests' preferred upscale restaurant 
destination and believe targeted marketing investments that heighten awareness, reinforce the premium image of our brand and 
highlight the authenticity of our dining experience will continue to generate guest loyalty and promote brand advocacy. 
Opportunistical4, Remodel Select Restaurants. Beginning in 2015, we plan to launch an opportunistic remodel program with the target 
of remodeling three to four restaurants during the 2015 fiscal year. We believe our new design will enhance the guest experience, 
highlight our brand attributes and encourage guest trial and frequency. We also believe there are opportunities to optimize restaurant 
capacity and merchandising to maximize sales per square foot. 
Improve Margins by Leveraging Our Infrastructure and Investments in Human Capital 
To support our future growth and improve our operations and management team, over the last three years we have invested over $5 million in 
incremental annual personnel costs by adding 18 positions to our corporate team and adding 16 local sales manager positions and five assistant 
manager positions at the restaurant level. These hires have bolstered key functional areas and supported future growth initiatives including senior 
leadership, new restaurant site selection and analysis, new restaurant design, group dining, product innovation and in-restaurant employee training. 
In addition, we have implemented initiatives in our restaurants to improve labor productivity, which we believe will further enhance restaurant 
profitability and the guest experience. As evidenced by our improvement in both comparable restaurant sales growth and restaurant contribution in 
2014, these investments and initiatives have yielded positive results and we believe we will continue to benefit from these investments as we grow 
our business in the long-term. Furthermore, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue Over 
time as we are able to leverage these investments by growing revenue faster than our fixed cost base. In addition, we have made substantial 
investments in our IT systems, and we expect to utilize our IT infrastruMure for continued improvements in operational efficiency and margins 
through the use of labor productivity and training tools. 
Properties 
As of the date of this prospectus, we operate 26 restaurants in the United States, 10 restaurants in Brazil and one joint venture restaurant in 
Mexico. We operate a variety of restaurant formats, including in-line and free-standing locations. Our restaurants range in size from approximately 
7,000 to 16,000 square feet, with seating from 200 to 500 guests. Going forward we plan to open restaurants that will range from approximately 
7,000 to 10,000 square feet per restaurant and may vary depending on site specific opportunities. 
We currently lease all of our restaurants except for two locations. Our leases generally have initial terms of between 10 and 20 years and can 
be extended only in five-year increments. All of our leases in the United States require a fixed annual rent, and many require the payment of 
additional rent if restaurant sales exceed a negotiated amount. Generally. our leases are "net" leases, which require us to pay all of the cost of 
insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel them leases at our option. 
In addition, we lease approximately 14.000 square feet of office space in Dallas, Texas which we use as our corporate headquarters. This lease 
expires in 2017, with options to renew until 2022. We utilize approximately 4.600 square feet of office space above our Santo Amaro restaurant in 
Sib Paulo for our corporate office in Brazil.
