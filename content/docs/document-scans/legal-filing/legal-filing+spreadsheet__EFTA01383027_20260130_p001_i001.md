Secondary market pricing — stable and driven by rational participants 
Pricing in the Secondary market is a key factor that sellers consider when evaluating a decision to potentially transact. In 
2017, the average headline high bid across all strategies remained strong at 93% of NAV.55 While pricing increased 
slightly from the prior year, a closer review of pricing data revealed that younger funds with available dry powder received 
stronger pricing. Tail-end funds typically have few remaining unrealized assets with little projected uplift in value. This 
results in wider discounts than kinds of more recent vintages whose assets still have potential for growth. 
While overall buyout funds traded at 99% of NAV in 2017 (skewed positively by high demand for more recent vintage 
funds), other funds. and one-off transactions (i.e., smaller portfolio deals without structure) traded at significantly larger 
discounts. There is an even greater price gap for perceived -out-of-favor funds and lower-quality managers. It is 
Glendower's opinion that staying focused on bottom-up fund and asset selection, often resulting in acquiring one or only 
a few funds from a given seller. may result in the ability to generate stronger performance than larger portfolio purchases. 
The Manager believes that buying a large diversified portfolio in an auction, with the use of significant leverage and/or 
transaction structuring, is effectively purchasing a levered private equity index with diminished ability to generate alpha. 
It is important to note that while the Greenhill data of headline pricing captures bids received by sellers, it does not 
necessarily mean that most funds trade in the 90% range of NAV. The aggregate pricing data masks the broadening 
spread of discounts paid in the underlying deals which can be skewed by a number of factors, including large portfolio 
trades that often achieve strong pricing. 
It is also worthwhile to note that the pricing data is as of the Record Date,56 and does not factor in transaction structuring.
