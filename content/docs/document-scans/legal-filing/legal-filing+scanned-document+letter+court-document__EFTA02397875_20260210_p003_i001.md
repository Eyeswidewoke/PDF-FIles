January 28, 2012 -- THE Associat=d Press reported last week that Fidel Castro, the former president of Cuba= wrote an 
opinion piece on a Cuban Web site, following a Republican Party presidential candidates' debate in Fl=rida, in which he 
argued that the "selection of a Republican candidate f=r the presidency of this globalized and expansive empire is — and 
I mean=this seriously — the greatest competition of idiocy and ignorance that has ever been." 
When Marxists are complaining th=t your party's candidates are disconnected from today's global realiti=s, it's generally 
not a good sign. But they're not alone. 
There is today an enormous gap b=tween the way many C.E.O.'s in America — not Wall Street-types, but th= people 
who lead premier companies that make things and create real jobs — look at the world and how the average 
cong=essmen, senator or president looks at the world. They are literally lookin= at two different worlds — and this 
applies to both parties. 
Consider the meeting that this p=per reported on from last February between President Obama and the Apple c=-
founder Steve Jobs, who died in October. The president, understandably, asked Jobs why almost all of the 70 
million=i Phones, 30 million iPads and 59 million other products Apple sold last ye=r were made overseas. Obama 
inquired, couldn't that work come back home?="Those jobs aren't coming back," Jobs replied. 
Politicians see the world as blo=s of voters living in specific geographies — and they see their job as m=ximizing the 
economic benefits for the voters in their geography. Many C.E.O.'s, though, increasingly see the world as=a place where 
their products can be made anywhere through global supply ch=ins (often assembled with nonunion-protected labor) 
and sold everywhere. 
These C.E.O.'s rarely talk abo=t "outsourcing" these days. Their world is now so integrated that ther= is no "out" and no 
"in" anymore. In their businesses, every product and many services now are imagined, designed, marketed and b=ilt 
through global supply chains that seek to access the best quality tale=t at the lowest cost, wherever it exists. They see 
more and more of their =roducts today as "Made in the World" not "Made in America." Therein lies the tension. So 
many of "our" =ompanies actually see themselves now as citizens of the world. But Obama i= president of the United 
States. 
Victor Fung, the chairman of Li =amp; Fung, one of Hong Kong's oldest textile manufacturers, remarked to =e last year 
that for many years his company operated on the rule: "You sourced in Asia, and you sold in America and Europe.=94 
Now, said Fung, the rule is: "'Source everywhere, manufacture ever=where, sell everywhere.' The whole notion of an 
'export' is really d=sappearing." 
Mike Splinter, the C.E.O. of App=ied Materials, has put it to me this way: "Outsourcing was 10 years ago,=where you'd 
say, 'Let's send some software generation overseas.' This is not the outsourcing we're doing today. T=is is just where I 
am going to get something done. Now you say, 'Hey, ha=f my Ph.D.'s in my R-and-D department would rather live in 
Singapore, Ta=wan or China because their hometown is there and they can go there and still work for my company.' This 
is the =ext evolution." He has many more choices.
