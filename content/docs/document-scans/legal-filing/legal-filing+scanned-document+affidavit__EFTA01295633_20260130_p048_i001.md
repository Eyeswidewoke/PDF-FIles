785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
445 n.18 (4th Cir. 2003); see also Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 1433, 185 
L. Ed. 2d 515 (2013) (explaining that individual damage-related questions might destroy 
predominance); Windham v. Am. Brands, Inc., 565 F.2d 59, 71-72 (4th Cir. 1977). 
The district court appropriately resolved predominance separately from commonality. 
Plaintiffs' failure to address the predominance finding in any way ends their appeal. 
[`925] C. 
The majority at least recognizes that Plaintiffs should have ["75] been "more explicit" in 
addressing predominance. Maj. op. at 54; see also id. at 55 (acknowledging that Plaintiffs' 
"express[]" arguments largely concern commonality). Even so, it concludes that certain 
oblique references in Plaintiffs' briefs preserved a predominance-related challenge on 
appeal. They do not. 
Plaintiffs' statement of the issue on appeal, for instance, does not help them. See maj. op. 
at 53. The statement asks only whether "it [was] error or an abuse of discretion for the 
district court not to follow this Circuit's mandate" when it decertified the class. See 
Appellant's Br. 1. Here again, Plaintiffs never mention predominance, and the statement 
does not otherwise indicate any specific complaint with the district court's predominance 
holding. Even if it had, that reference would not have been enough without some further 
argument on the matter -- an argument that Plaintiffs wholly failed to provide. See Belk, 
Inc., 679 F.3d at 153 n.6; 11126 Balt. Blvd., Inc. v. Prince George's Cnty., Md., 58 F.3d 
988, 993 n.7 (4th Cir. 1995). 
The majority also ignores Plaintiffs' waiver because their brief contains some broadly 
stated attacks on the district court's decertification decision — attacks purportedly not 
"limit[ed] to the question of commonality." Maj. op. at 55. But in the usual case, a 
generalized attack ["76] on the lower court's decision does not preserve the specific 
arguments that might be subsumed within the broader one. Quite the opposite: a 
"generalized assertion of error" will not suffice to preserve anything. MMG Fin. Corp. v. 
Midwest Amusements Park, LLC, 630 F.3d 651, 659 (7th Cir. 2011); see also, e.g., Garrett 
v. Selby Connor Maddux & Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 841 (10th Cir. 2005); Norman v. United 
States, 429 F.3d 1081, 1091 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Preservation would have little to 
recommend it if litigants could make nebulous, broadly worded arguments and trust 
appellate courts to work out the details once the opposing party points out the default. 
In much the same way, Plaintiffs did not preserve their predominance challenge by citing a 
few cases that happen to touch upon the concept. See maj. op. at 54. The traditional rule 
provides that citations to the "occasional case," without any fuller discussion, do not 
preserve an argument. Pike v. Guarino, 492 F.3d 61, 78 n.9 (1st Cir. 2007); see also Am. 
Wildlands v. Kempthorne, 530 F.3d 991, 1001, 382 U.S. App. D.C. 78 (D.C. Cir. 2008) ("A 
fleeting statement in the parenthetical of a citation is no more sufficient to raise a claim 
than a cursory remark in a footnote[.]"). Similarly, "[m]ere notation of the applicable law, 
without any argumentation as to how it applies to [this] case, does not raise the issue of its 
application on appeal." Sou v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 1, 6 n.11 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted here and throughout); accord Johnson v. United 
States, 734 F.3d 352, 360 (4th Cir. 2013).
