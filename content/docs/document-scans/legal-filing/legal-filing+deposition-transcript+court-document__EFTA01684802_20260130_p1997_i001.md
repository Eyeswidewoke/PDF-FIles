ApplkatIon of Payments 
We are changing how we apply payments on your account. Generally. payments above the total minimum amount due will be applied first to 
balances with higher interest rates. Accordingly. effective with payments processed on or after February 19, 2010. the last paragraph of the 
Payments section of your Agreement is deleted and replaced with the following:

corresponding debit originated? 
Finance Charges 
We are making changes to how the penalty interest rate and finance charges work. including: 
• how paying late can cause the penalty interest rate to apply to your account: 
• when interest is not charged on Features: 
• how we refer to the penalty interest rate. (We are replacing 'Default Rate' or similar phrases with 'Penally APR.') 
Any penalty interest rate on your account when these changes go into effect will continue to apply. Also. the penalty interest rate could be 
extended under the new terms. 
Accordingly. effective with billing periods beginning on or after January 22. 2010. the Finance Charges on Features section of your Agreement 
is deleted and replaced with the following:

the Charge is added to a Feature balance. 
Finance Charges will not accrue for Charges in a Feature balance during a billing period. except for Charges added to a Feature 
balance during that billing period at your request. if the Total Previous Balance for that billing period is zero or a credit balance or 
payment in ful of the Total Previous Balance is credited to your Account by the Closing Date of that billing period. 
In addition. if (i) a payment of less than the Total Previous Balance for a bang period is credited to your Account by the Closing Date 
of the billing period and (i) the Total Previous Balance for the immediately preceding biting period was zero or a credit balance or 
payment in ful of that Total Previous Balance was credited to your Account by the Closing Date of that billing period. then Finance 
Charges will not accrue during the billing period on the portion of Charges that were added to a Feature balance automatically to 
which the payment referred to in (i) is allocated.

not credited to your Account by the Closing Date of the billing period in which it is due: (ii) any Amount Due is not credited to your 
Account by the Closing Date of the billing period following the billing period in which it was due: or (ii) a payment on your Account is 
not honored by your financial institution. For any Feature balance not already at the Penalty APR. the Penally APR will apply to 
Charges incurred and added to that Feature balance fifteen or more days after we send you a Penalty APR notice. and will apply until 
the billing period after your Account does not meet any of these conditions for twelve consecutive billing periods (starting with the
