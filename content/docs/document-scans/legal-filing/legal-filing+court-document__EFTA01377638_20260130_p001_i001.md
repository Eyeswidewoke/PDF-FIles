S-1/A 
A common stock granted after September 30. 2015, with an exercise price per share equal to the public offering price 
set forth on the cover page of the final prospectus for this offering; 
• 924,100 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the vesting of RSUs granted after September 30, 2015; 
• 1,940,058 shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock issued after September 30, 2015; and 
• 34,200.000 shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans, 
consisting of: 
• 30,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan 
(2015 Plan), which will become effective prior to the completion of this offering; and 
• 4,200,000 shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015 Employee Stock 
Purchase Plan (ESPP), which will become effective prior to the completion of this offering. 
Our 2015 Plan and ESPP each provide for annual automatic increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder, 
and our 2015 Plan also provides for increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder based on awards under certain of 
our other equity compensation plans that expire, are forfeited, or are otherwise repurchased by us. See the section titled 
"Executive Compensation—Employee Benefit and Stock Plans" for additional information. 
Except as otherwise indicated, all information in this prospectus assumes the following: 
• the filing and effectiveness of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the effectiveness of our 
amended and restated bylaws, each of which will occur immediately prior to the completion of this offering; 
• the reclassification of all outstanding shares of our common stock into an equivalent number of shares of our Class B 
common stock, which will occur prior to the completion of this offering, and the authorization of our Class A common 
stock; 
• the automatic conversion and reclassification of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock (other than 
shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock) into an aggregate of 125.552.520 shares of our Class B common 
stock, which will occur immediately prior to the completion of this offering; 
• the automatic conversion and reclassification of 9,700,289 outstanding shares of our Series E convertible preferred 
stock into an aggregate of 14,999,987 shares of our Class B common stock immediately prior to the completion of this 
offering, based on the assumed initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated 
offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. These 5,299,698 additional shares represent 
approximately 1.6% of the total number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock to be 
outstanding after this offering. A S1.00 decrease in the initial public offering price would increase the number of shares 
of our Class B common stock issuable upon conversion and reclassification of our Series E convertible preferred stock 
by 1,363,637, and a 51.00 increase in the initial public offering price would decrease the number of shares of our 
Class B common stock issuable upon conversion and reclassification of our Series E convertible preferred stock by 
1,153,845; and 
• no exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares.
