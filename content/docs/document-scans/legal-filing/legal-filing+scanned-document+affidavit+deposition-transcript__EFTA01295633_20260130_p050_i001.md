785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea;

E. 
The majority goes on to hold that the mandate rule barred the district court from examining 
Rule 23(b)(3) predominance. See maj. op. at 58-62. That view is factually and legally 
incorrect. The decision in the prior appeal in this case did not prevent the district court in 
any way from considering predominance because our prior decision did not say anything 
about predominance. 
In its original class certification decision in 2007, the district court held that Plaintiffs did not 
satisfy three of Rule 23(a)'s four requirements. It expressly declined to consider "the 
remaining requirements of ['92T] Rule 23(b)." J.A. 8997. On appeal, the parties' 
submissions focused solely on Rule 23(a). A majority of the Court then reviewed these 
"Rule 23(a) factors" and found them "satisfied." Brown v. Nucor Corp., 576 F.3d 149, 160 
(4th Cir. 2009) ("Brown I"). The Brown I majority initially went on to hold, in a single 
sentence at the end r801 of the opinion, that "the requirements of [Rule] 23(b)(3) ha[d] 
also been satisfied for these claims." See Brown v. Nucor Corp., No. 08-1247, 576 F.3d 
149 at 160 (4th Cir. Aug. 7, 2009). Nucor then petitioned for rehearing en banc, arguing, 
among other things, that neither the lower court nor the parties had previously analyzed 
the Rule 23(b) issue. See Nucor Pet. for Reh'g at 9, Brown I, 576 F.3d 149 (No. 08-1247), 
ECF No. 53. In response, the Brown I panel amended its opinion and excised any mention 
of Rule 23(b)(3). See Order, Brown v. Nucor Corp., No. 08-1247 (4th Cir. Oct. 8, 2009). 
One can easily discern why the opinion was amended: Brown I could not decide a fact-
intensive issue -- that is, the predominance issue under Rule 23(b)(3) -- when the parties 
had not yet argued it and the district court had not yet addressed it. See Transamerica 
Leasing, Inc. v. Instit. of London Underwriters, 430 F.3d 1326, 1332 (11th Cir. 2005) 
(explaining that the mandate rule and the broader law of the case doctrine "cannot apply 
when the issue in question was outside the scope of the prior appeal"). In fact, up to that 
point, Plaintiffs had never even sought certification under Rule 23(b)(3); they sought to 
certify only a Rule 23(b)(2) class or, in the alternative, a so-called "hybrid" action. 
By removing any reference to Rule 23(b), Brown I left it to the district court to determine in 
the first instance whether Plaintiffs' class ("81] met that provision's requirements. The 
district court complied with both the letter and the spirit of Brown I, and it correctly took 
"into account [the] opinion and the circumstances it embrace[d]." United States v. Bell, 5 
F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir. 1993); see also, e.g., Lindy Pen Co. v. Bic Pen Corp., 982 F.2d 1400, 
1404-05 (9th Cir. 1993) (affirming district court's decision not to order accounting or 
damages, despite appellate court's instructions to "order an accounting and to award 
damages," where district court acted in line with the "spirit" of the mandate). An appellate 
mandate "does not reach questions which might have been decided but were not." United 
States v. Lentz, 524 F.3d 501, 528 (4th Cir. 2008). And "[w]hile a mandate is controlling as 
to matters within its compass, on the remand a lower court is free as to other issues." 
Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 168, 59 S. Ct. 777, 83 L. Ed. 1184 (1939). 
Simply put, the Brown I mandate did not apply to Rule 23(b)(3), nor could it. 
On remand after Brown I, the district court initially certified the two promotions classes 
under Rule 23(b)(3). The court later reconsidered, as it was entitled to do under Rule 23, 
which provides that "[a]n order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or 
amended before final judgment." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C); see also Fed. R. Civ. P.
