By the early 1990s, bass Melvin Franklin began missing performances due to failing health and Ray 
Davis, former bass man of Parliament-Funkadelic, began touring as a fill-in during 1993. Franklin died 
after suffering a brain seizure at the age of 52 on February 23, 1995, and Davis was named his official 
replacement. The group subsequently finished production on For Lovers Only, an album of pop 
standards featuring two tracks recorded with Melvin Franklin prior to his death. 
This lineup would not last, however, as Davis was diagnosed with lung cancer[36] and left shortly after 
completing the album. Davis died in New Brunswick, New Jersey of respiratory problems and 
complications of lung cancer on the evening of Tuesday July 5, 2005. 
The group continued as a quartet for a short time before recruiting bass Harry McGilberry, a former 
member of the Futures. For Lovers Only would also be the last contribution for lead Ali-011ie Woodson; 
he was released from the group shortly after McGilberry's hiring due to health problems:(38] he 
suffered two bouts of throat cancer in a short time. He was replaced by new member Terry Weeks, who 
had served as his sub. 
The Temptations' new lineup, consisting of Otis Williams, Ron Tyson, Theo Peoples, and newcomers 
Harry McGilberry and Terry Weeks, toured throughout 1997, and was featured in the halftime show of 
Super Bowl XXXII in early 1998, which celebrated the fortieth anniversary of Motown. Later that year, 
The Temptations released Phoenix Rising, vocally arranged by 1980s producer Narada Michael Walden, 
Claytoven Richardson, Theo Peoples, Tony Lindsey and Skyler Jett, which became their first million-
selling album in over twenty years. The album was anchored by "Stay", a single featuring Theo Peoples 
on lead and including a sample from "My Girl", which became a number-one hit on the adult 
contemporary charts. 
Peoples was fired from the group before the release of Phoenix Rising because of issues with drug 
addiction,(39) and was replaced by Barrington "Bo" Henderson. Henderson lip-synched to Peoples's 
vocals in the "Stay" music video, and the completed album features lead vocals on different tracks by 
both Henderson and Peoples. Peoples would go on to join the Four Tops the following year.

Also in 1998, de Passe Entertainment (run by former Motown vice-president Suzanne de Passe) and 
Hallmark Entertainment produced The Temptations, a four-hour television miniseries based on Otis 
Williams' Temptations autobiography. The miniseries was broadcast in two parts on NBC on November 1 
and November 2, 1998, with the first part covering the group's history from 1958 to 1968, and the 
second part the years from 1968 to 1995. The miniseries was a ratings success and was nominated for 
five Emmy Awards, with Allan Arkush winning for Best Direction; it was subsequently rerun on the VH-1 
cable television network and released to VHS and DVD. 
Otis Williams' former wife Josephine Miles, Melvin Franklin's mother Rose Franklin, David Ruffin's 
family, and Johnnie Mae Matthews filed lawsuits against Williams, Motown, de Passe and de Passe
