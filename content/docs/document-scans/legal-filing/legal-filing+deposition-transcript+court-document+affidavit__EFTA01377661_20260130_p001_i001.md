changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles; 
• any significant change in our management: and 
• general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets. 
In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company's 
securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, 
could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources. 
A total of 295,944,713, or 91.6%, of the outstanding shares of our capital stock after this offering will be restricted from 
immediate resale but may be sold in the near future. The large number of shares of our capital stock eligible for public 
sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our Class A 
common stock. 
The market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A 
common stock in the market after this offering, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price 
of our Class A common stock. Based on shares of our capital stock outstanding as of September 30, 2015, we will 
have 322,944,713 shares of our capital stock outstanding after this offering. Our executive officers, directors,

and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock, options, and warrants have entered into market standoff agreements with us 
or lock-up agreements with the underwriters under which they have agreed, subject to specific exceptions, not to sell any of our 
capital stock for at least 180 days following the date of this prospectus. As a result of these agreements, the provisions of our 
investors' rights agreement described further in the section titled "Description of Capital Stock—Registration Rights" and the 
provisions of Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, shares of our capital stock will be available for sale in the public 
market as follows: 
beginning on the date of this prospectus, all 27,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock sold in this offering will be 
immediately available for sale in the public market; and 
beginning 181 days after the date of this prospectus, the remainder of the shares of our capital stock will be eligible for 
sale in the public market from time to time thereafter, subject in some cases to the volume and other restrictions of 
Rule 144, our insider trading policy, and certain of our market standoff agreements. 
We or the underwriters may release certain stockholders from the lock-up agreements or market standoff agreements prior 
to the end of the 180-day period. In addition, we may extend the restricted period under certain of our market standoff agreements, 
covering 30,271,874 shares of our capital stock, to 270 days. 
Following the expiration of the lock-up agreements referred to above, stockholders owning an aggregate of up 
to 248,396,599 shares of our Class B common stock (including shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of warrants to purchase 
shares of our capital stock that were outstanding as of September 30, 2015) can require us to register shares of our capital stock 
owned by them for public sale in the United States. Future transfers by holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in 
those shares converting into shares of our Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions. In addition, we intend to file a 
registration statement to register approximately 144,174,276 shares of our capital stock reserved for future issuance under our 
equity compensation plans. Upon effectiveness of that registration statement, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise 
periods, the expiration or waiver of the market standoff agreements and lock-up agreements referred to above, and applicable 
volume restrictions and other restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares of our capital stock issued upon exercise of outstanding 
options to purchase shares of our Class A common stock will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open 
market. 
Future sales of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a 
price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more 
difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.
