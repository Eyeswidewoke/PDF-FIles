Net periodic benefit cost is measured using weighted average assumptions as of the beginning of each year. 
Expected rate of return on plan assets is estimated by utilizing forward-looking, long-term return, risk and correlation assumptions 
developed and updated annually by NAI. These assumptions are weighted by actual or target allocations to each underlying asset 
class represented in the pension plan asset portfolio. NAI also assesses the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 
assumption by comparison to long-term historical performance on an asset class to ensure the assumption is reasonable. 
Long-term trends are also evaluated relative to market factors such as inflation. interest rates, and fiscal and monetary policies in 
order to assess the capital market assumptions. 
NAI calculates its expected return on plan assets by using the market related value of plan assets determined by adjusting the 
actual fair value of plan assets for unrecognized gains or losses on plan assets. Unrecognized gains or losses represent the difference 
between actual returns and expected returns on plan assets for each fiscal year and are recognized by NAI evenly over a three year 
period. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a three-year period, the future value of assets will be 
impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. 
(c) Pension Plan Assets 
Plan assets are held in a master trust of Parent and invested in separately managed accounts and other commingled investment 
vehicles holding domestic and international equity securities, domestic fixed income securities and other investment classes. Parent 
employs a total return approach whereby a diversified mix of asset class investments is used to maximize the long-term return of plan 
assets for an acceptable level of risk. Alternative investments are also used to enhance risk-adjusted long-term returns while improving 
portfolio diversification. Risk management is managed through diversification across asset classes, multiple investment manager 
portfolios and both general and portfolio-specific investment guidelines. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of the 
plan liabilities, plan funded status and Parent's financial condition. This asset allocation policy mix is reviewed annually and actual versus 
target allocations are monitored regularly and rebalanced on an as-needed basis. Plan assets are invested using a combination of active 
and passive investment strategies. Passive, or "indexed" strategies, attempt to mimic rather than exceed the investment performance of 
a market benchmark. The trust's active investment strategies employ multiple investment management firms. Managers within each 
asset class cover a range of investment styles and approaches and are combined in a way that controls for capitalization, and style 
biases (equities) and interest rate exposures (fixed income) versus benchmark indices. Monitoring activities to evaluate performance 
against targets and measure investment risk take place on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic 
asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.
