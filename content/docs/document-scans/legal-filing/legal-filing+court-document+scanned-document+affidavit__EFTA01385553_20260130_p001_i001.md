This Information Statement has been prepared to comply with Article 15 of the Securities Financing 
Transactions Regulation by informing you of the general risks and consequences that may be involved 
in consenting to a right of use of collateral provided under a security collateral arrangement or of 
concluding a title transfer collateral arrangement ("Re-use Risks and Consequences'). The 
information required to be provided to you pursuant to Article 15 of the Securities Financing 
Transactions Regulation relates only to Re-use Risks and Consequences, and so this Information 
Statement does not address any other risks or consequences that may arise as a result of your 
particular circumstances or as a result of the terms of particular Transactions. 
This Information Statement is not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, legal, financial, tax, 
accounting or other advice. Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, we are not providing you with 
any such legal, financial, tax, accounting or other advice and you should consult your own advisors for

requirements of, and results of, entering into any Transaction. 
Appendix 2 sets out an indicative (but not exhaustive) list of types of agreement that may constitute 
Collateral Arrangements.
