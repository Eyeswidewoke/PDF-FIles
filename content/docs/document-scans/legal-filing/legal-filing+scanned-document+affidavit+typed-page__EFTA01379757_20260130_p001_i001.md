their assets to the board of directors, the firm's stakeholders are beset with the problem of 
holding the board of directors accountable. This is the agency problem: how do you ensure 
that corporate directors (agents) operate faithfully on behalf of their stakeholders, rather 
than in directors' own interests through general malingering or outright stealing of 
corporate assets? -3
The prevailing view is that different stakeholders should get different solutions to the 
agency problem. Shareholders require the exclusive fiduciary attention of directors inside 
the corporate boardroom because of their (the shareholders) distance from firm 
operations. Workers, in comparison, are physically present on the shop floor and can 
therefore monitor and negotiate the terms of their labor themselves, individually or 
collectively. Consumers are present at the cash-register and can monitor their interest in 
corporate activity by inspecting the goods, services, and prices offered. In sum, the agency 
problem is managed for shareholders by imposing fiduciary obligations to shareholders on 
the board of directors, while the agency problem for workers and consumers is managed 
primarily by particula ['i94] rized terms in specific contracts on a negotiated or take-it-or-
leave-it basis. Where workers and consumers are vulnerable and cannot protect their 
interests through contract, corporate theory calls for such vulnerabilities to be solved 
through external governmental regulation such as labor laws and consumer protection 
statutes, rather than through any departure from shareholder primacy in firm governance. 
Corporate law theorists contend that this organizational design is in the best interest of 
capital, labor, and consumers. It is therefore the regime that these stakeholders would 
voluntarily agree to if they sat down and negotiated the matter (or at least it is the regime 
they would all agree to after hearing a lecture on shareholder primacy theory). ^'s But these 
groups do not actually negotiate and plan the design themselves. To do so would be as 
transactionally-burdensome as driving down the street looking for a designer to build an 
internet phone. Instead, the basic organizational design is incorporated by law into 
corporate charters as an "off-the-rack" ready-made system. Users of corporate charters 
are free to delete default corporate governance provisions and replace them with some 
other schema, perhaps one in x195] which important corporate decisions are submitted 
directly to a vote by all stakeholders. In practice this does not happen. Corporate 
stakeholders stick with the default rules of directorial authority and shareholder primacy for 
one of two reasons. First, maybe it really is the rule that stakeholders would settle on if 
they designed the corporate governance structure themselves, so there is no impetus to 
change it. Second, stakeholders may stick with the default rule because they find it 
prohibitively costly, in terms of time, intelligence, and logistics, to negotiate an alternative 
arrangement. Thus, they stick with the default because they are stuck with it. ^" 
For reasons I explore below, corporate law's purported solutions to the agency 
problem leave non-shareholding stakeholders vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation 
by corporations acting on behalf of shareholders. Here I will focus in particular on non-
shareholder's susceptibility to the adverse influence of corporate speech. To track this 
influence, I explore the distinct discourse norms that attend corporate speech to different 
corporate stakeholders, including shareholders, workers, and consumers. I contend that 
these discourse norms should themselves be regarded as default rules of corporate law, 
and I argue that the discourse norm defaults should be altered in order to improve
