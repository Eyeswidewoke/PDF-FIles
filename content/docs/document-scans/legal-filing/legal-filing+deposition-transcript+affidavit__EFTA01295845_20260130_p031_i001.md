2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93633, * 
[FIN21] To establish a claim for the avoidance of a fraudulent transfer pursuant to 11 
U.S.C. § 548(a)(1)(A), a party mush show that within two years of the petition date, the 
debtor made such transfer or incurred such obligation with intent to hinder, delay, or 
defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became, on or after the date that such 
transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, indebted. 
[HN22] To establish a claim for the recovery of a post-petition transfer pursuant to 11 
U.S.C. § 549, the appropriate inquiry is: (1) whether a transfer of property occurred; (2) 
whether the property transferred was property of the estate; (3) whether the transfer 
occurred after commencement of the bankruptcy case; and (4) whether the transfer was 
authorized by the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. § 549. 
Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 550, a trustee may recover transfers avoided under 11 U.S.C. §§ 
544, 547, 548, and 549, for the benefit of the estate, the property transferred, or if the court 
so orders, the value of such property, form the initial transferee of such transfer or the 
entity for whose benefit such transfer was made. 
Requests for admission [" 24] numbered 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13, 16, 18, 22, and 23, 
correspond to the elements required to establish each of Carroll's claims. Each relevant 
request was deemed admitted. Thus, the bankruptcy court did not err in finding that there 
remained no genuine issue as to any material fact. As such, the burden was properly 
shifted to North Shore to show a genuine issue remaining for trial. 
North Shore did not present any evidence in support of judgment in its favor. It merely 
pointed the court again to Dawn Prosser's affidavit. As previously discussed, the affidavit 
contains only general denials. Such general denials are not sufficient to satisfy North 
Shore's burden of proof. See FED. R. Civ. P. 56(e) ( (HN23] "an adverse party may not rest 
upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleadings, but the adverse 
party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific 
facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.") Thus, the bankruptcy court did not err 
in finding that North Shore failed to meet its burden. 
Based on a plenary review of the record, the Court finds that each of the elements required 
to establish Carroll's claims were [' 25] satisfied by facts underlying North Shore's deemed 
admissions. As such, the bankruptcy court did not err in concluding that Carroll was 
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
D. Morton lot ReconsninDon 
In denying North Shore's motion for reconsideration, the Bankruptcy Division found that 
North Shore pointed to no newly discovered evidence or any other basis for a grant of 
reconsideration. 
(HN24) A bankruptcy court's denial of an appellant's motion for reconsideration is 
generally reviewed for abuse of discretion. See generally Max's Seafood Cafe v. 
Quinteros, 176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir. 1999). "However, to the extent that the denial of 
reconsideration is predicated on an issue of law, such an award is reviewed de novo; to 
the extent that the (trial court's] disposition of the reconsideration motion is based upon a 
factual finding, it is reviewed for clear error." Id.
