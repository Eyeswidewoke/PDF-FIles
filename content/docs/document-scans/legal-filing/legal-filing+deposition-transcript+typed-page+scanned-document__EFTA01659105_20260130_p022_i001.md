Meanwhile, Reuters (11/23, Zengerle) reports Trump "gave some ground on Monday to 
allow...Biden's transition to the presidency after the ranks grew of prominent Republicans 
calling for Trump to end efforts to overturn his election defeat." Reuters says that while 
"intensifying pressure from some Republicans may have factored in Trump's move to allow 
funding for Biden's transition," what was "possibly as consequential, if not more, was Michigan's 
certification of Biden's victory in that state." 
Politico (11/23, Levine, 4.29M) reports Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) "join[ed] a small group 
of Republican senators calling for the transition process to begin," and he "wrote that any 
disputes over the election results should end by December 8." Politico adds Sens. Jim Risch (R-
ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Mitt 
Romney (R-UT), Ben Sasse (R-NE), and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) have also "acknowledged the 
need for a transition." 
On CNBC's Squawk BoxVI (11/23, 114K), Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) said, "I have fully 
supported the President's pursuing every plausible strategy - recounts, and litigating 
irregularities - but at some point you exhaust those possibilities. I think the President has 
reached that point in Pennsylvania. He appears to have reached that point in Georgia. Michigan 
wasn't even close, and so now the idea that a sitting President would try to, I don't know, 
pressure, cajole, persuade state legislators to dismiss the will of their voters and select their 
own group of electors and send them to the electoral college is completely inconsistent with any 
kind of truly democratic society so that shouldn't be going on in my view." Toomey also said, "I 
don't have any regrets about having supported Donald Trump for reelection." 
The New York Times (11/23, Edmondson, Cochrane, 18.61M) says that Sen. Lamar 
Alexander (R-TN) on Monday "offered a pointed call for President Trump to begin a peaceful 
transfer of power, urging him to stand aside if only to preserve his legacy after Michigan's 
statewide electoral board approved its presidential vote tally in favor of" Biden. In a statement, 
Alexander said, "Since it seems apparent that...Biden will be the president-elect, my hope is 
that...Trump will take pride in his considerable accomplishments, put the country first and have 
a prompt and orderly transition to help the new administration succeed." Alexander added, 
"When you are in public life, people remember the last thing you do." 
Reuters (11/23, Cowan) reports that Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) on Monday "said 
while some irregularities in the Nov. 3 presidential election have been found, there is no 
indication they were widespread enough to call into question...Biden's victory." In a statement, 
Capito "said Biden and...Harris should begin receiving `all appropriate' briefings related to 
national security and COVID-19 and that `if states certify the results as they currently stand, 
Vice President Joe Biden will be our next president." 
The Hill (11/23, Mastrangelo, 2.98M) says Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) "reportedly said 
Monday that the outcome of the presidential election is `becoming increasingly clear,' and that 
`evidence of a systemic problem ... seem to be wanting." The Hill adds that Cornyn on Sunday 
"said in a tweet that Biden should be allowed to receive intelligence briefings that are being 
blocked by Trump's General Services Administration." 
Terry Moran reported on ABC's Good Morning AmericaVi (11/23, 3.1M) that "more 
Republicans are acknowledging the election is over," and while the New York Times (11/23, 
Thrush, Cochrane, Rosenberg, Fuchs, Tompkins, 18.61M) says "most congressional Republicans 
have refused to acknowledge Mr. Biden's victory," the AP (11/23, Bauder) reports that "former 
Watergate sleuth" Carl Bernstein on Sunday "took to Twitter to list the names of 21 Republican 
senators who he says have `repeatedly expressed contempt' for...Trump and his fitness to be 
president." 
However, the Washington Post (11/23, Hamburger, Nakashima, 14.2M) reports former 
Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, former CIA Director Michael Hayden, and former 
Director of National Intelligence John D. Negroponte were among "a group of leading GOP 
national security experts" on Monday who called upon congressional Republicans "to 
demand...Trump concede the election and immediately begin the transition to the incoming
