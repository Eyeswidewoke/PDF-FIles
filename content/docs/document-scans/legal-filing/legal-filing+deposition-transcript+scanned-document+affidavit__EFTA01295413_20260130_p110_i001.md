construction project, and we find it is the forum with the most significant contacts to the 
case. Accordingly, we conclude North Carolina has a substantial relationship to the 
settlement agreement, and there exists a reasonable basis for the parties' choice of law 
provision in their contract. Furthermore, based upon our review of the record, we cannot 
conclude that Ohio would have a greater material interest than North Carolina in the 
outcome of this case. Accordingly, we conclude North Carolina substantive law applies to 
the August 2001 agreement. 
r P20] Furthermore, because [HN2] traditional choice r10] of law principles provide 
that the law of the forum state governs on procedural matters, Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, 
Inc. (1984), 465 U.S. 770, 778, fn. 10, 104 S. Ct. 1473, 79 L. Ed. 2d 790; Lawson v. Valve-
Trol Co. (1991), 81 Ohio App.3d 1, 4, 610 N.E.2d 425, jurisdictional motion overruled, 61 
Ohio St. 3d 1422, 574 N.E.2d 1092; Restatement of the Law 2d, Conflict of Laws (1971) 
350, Section 122, we conclude Ohio procedural law applies to this cause. 
r P211 In its reply brief, Hanlin-Rainaldi has asserted an alternative assignment of error, 
namely, that the August 2001 agreement was modified or, alternatively, that release 
language in this agreement was waived. 
r P22] [HN3) "[A] reply brief is merely an opportunity to reply to the brief of appellee. * * * 
A reply brief may not raise new assignments, which were omitted from appellant's original 
brief, especially where leave to file a new assignment was not sought from this court."

which are completely inconsistent with and contrary to the theory upon which appellants 
proceeded below cannot be raised for the first time on review." Republic Steel Corp. v.

present these new arguments r 12] for the first time on appeal"); Shaffer v. OhioHealth

Miller v. Wikel Mfg. Co., Inc. (1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 76, 78, 545 N.E.2d 76. 
r P24] In the instant case, although this court granted Hanlin-Rainaldi's motion for leave 
to file a reply brief, Hanlin-Rainaldi did not seek leave to assert an alternative assignment 
of error in its reply brief. Additionally, before the trial court, Hanlin-Rainaldi did not raise 
whether Jeepers' payments on Note 1 following the August 2001 agreement constituted a 
modification or waiver of the release language in the settlement agreement. Accordingly,
