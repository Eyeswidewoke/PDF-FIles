four years for his dealings with Deripaska, faces additional sentencing for the Albanian case, highlighting the gravity 
of his betrayal of his role in national security and counterintelligence. The article noted that the review of 
McGonigal's past cases indicates the depth of concern within the FBI about the potential impact of his actions on 
key investigations over his 22-year career. 
The Pentagon Tried to Hide That It Bought Americans' Data Without a Warrant 
WIRED (01/26, Cameron) reported that the Pentagon has been revealed to have purchased Americans' phone 
location data and Internet metadata without a warrant, an activity that was kept hidden until Senator Ron Wyden 
delayed the appointment of a new NSA director. According to the article, this disclosure brought to light that the 
Defense Intelligence Agency, the NSA, and other intelligence agencies, including the FBI, were acquiring location 
data from private companies, circumventing the warrant process. Wyden's intervention has sparked a broader 
debate on surveillance reform, with a focus on legislation like the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which 
seeks to stop these warrantless data purchases. The article noted that the debate is intensifying in Congress, with 
conflicting views on the need for surveillance warrants and the reauthorization of Section 702, a key surveillance 
authority.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Former Los Angeles Coundl Member Sentenced To 13 Years In Prison For Pay-To-Play Corruption Scandal 
The Associated Press (01/26, Staff Writer) reported that a former Los Angeles City Council member was sentenced 
Friday to 13 years in prison for a pay-to-play bribery scandal involving real estate development projects. Jose 
Huizar, 55, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge John F. Walter, who also ordered him to pay $443,905 in restitution 
to the city and $38,792 to the IRS. Prosecutors said in a sentencing memorandum that Huizar chose "to place his 
own lust for money and power above the rights and interests of the people he was elected to serve." The article 
added that prosecutors said that from 2013 to 2017, Huizar masterminded a $1.5 million scheme tied to the 
approval of downtown high-rise developments while he chaired the city's powerful Planning and Land Use 
Management Committee. Huizar was accused of giving favorable treatment in exchange for cash, casino gambling 
chips, luxury stays in Las Vegas, expensive meals, prostitution services, flights, concert and sports tickets, political 
contributions, and funds to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit. A DOJ press release quoted Donald Alway, the 
Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, who said, "This years-long investigation uncovered 
one of the most audacious public corruption cases in this city's history, this case would not have been possible 
without the dedication of agents and prosecutors — and importantly— the cooperation of many citizens who were 
fed up with rampant malfeasance by public officials. Mr. Huizar ignored the needs of his constituents and instead, 
served his own interests by accepting bribes and a wide assortment of luxury perks from wealthy real estate 
moguls and others who could afford Huizar's political favors at the taxpayer's expense. My hope is that this case 
brings more citizens forward to the FBI when they suspect corrupt practices and foreign influence." The Hill (01/26, 
Irwin), Court House News (01/26, Pettersson), KTLA (CW-5) (01/26, Kiszla), Los Angeles Times (01/26, Smith, 
Zahniser), LA ist (01/26, Stoltze), Daily News (01/26, Shuster), California Globe (01/26, Symon), LA Weekly (01/26, 
Rocha), and the Los Angeles Magazine (01/26, McPhee) also reported on the story. 
A British Painting Stolen by Mobsters Is Returned to the Owner's Son — 54 Years Later 
The Associated Press (01/26, Brown) reported that an 18th-century British painting stolen by New Jersey mobsters 
in 1969 has been returned more than a half-century later to the family that bought it for $7,500 during the Great 
Depression, the FBI's Salt Lake City field office announced Friday. The article added that the 40-inch-by-50-inch 
(102-cm-by-127-cm) John Opie painting — titled "The Schoolmistress" — is the sister painting of a similar work 
housed in the Tate Britain art gallery in London. Authorities believe the piece was stolen with the help of a former 
New Jersey lawmaker, and then passed among organized crime members for years before it ended up in the 
southern Utah city of St. George. A Utah man had purchased a house in Florida in 1989 from Joseph Covello Sr. — a 
convicted mobster linked to the Gambino family — and the painting was included in the sale, the FBI said. The 
article noted that when the buyer died in 2020, a Utah accounting firm that was seeking to liquidate his property 
sought an appraisal for the painting and it was discovered to likely be the stolen piece, the FBI said. The article 
quoted FBI Special Agent Gary France, who worked on the case, who said, "This piece of art, what a history it's had, 
it traveled all through the U.K. when it was first painted, and owned by quite a few families in the U.K. And then it 
travels overseas to the United States and is sold during the Great Depression and then stolen by the mob and
