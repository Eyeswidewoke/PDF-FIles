indication of how public health officials at the CDC have been squeezed between Trump's 
demand for a normal school year and an out-of-control virus." 
The Washington Post (7/24, Hawkins, 14.2M) reports that on Friday, NIAID Director Dr. 
Anthony Fauci "said the country should try 'as best as we possibly can' to keep children in 
school but stressed that school reopenings should depend on the level of virus transmission in 
individual communities." Fauci is quoted as saying, "It depends on where you are. We live in a 
very large country that is geographically and demographically diverse and certainly different in 
the extent to which there is covid virus activity." 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (7/24, story 2, 1:02, Bojorquez, 4.11M) reported the debate 
over school openings is "leaving some teachers in fear," because some CDC "language, like 
'teach and reinforce use of cloth face coverings' written in May are now labeled 
recommendations." 
Similarly, ABC World News TonightVi (7/24, story 2, 1:46, Oquendo, 6.68M) reported 
"only 44% of parents are willing to send their kids to school," according to an ABC News/Ipsos 
poll. The segment added that a "large study in South Korea" found "that children under the age 
of 10 are the only group that spreads the virus less than adults." 
Los Angeles Superintendent Discusses Challenges Of School Reopenings. In an 
interview with NBC Nightly NewsVI (7/24, story 5, 3:24, Holt, 5.54M), Austin Beutner, Los 
Angeles Unified School District Superintendent says that reopening is an "incredibly tough call 
because we understand students need to be in school. But we can't compromise on the health 
and safety of all the school community." Beutner adds that COVID-19 infection "rates are still 
skyrocketing" in Los Angeles, and the community is "not ready" to return to school. However, 
he adds that "this fall, in addition to online learning, we're going to offer individual tutoring, 
both online and in person. We're going to do everything we can to try to help students catch 
Barron Trump's School Not Planning To Fully Reopen. The Washington Post (7/24, 
Stein, 14.2M) reports that "even as President Trump urges U.S. schools to reopen, his youngest 
son would probably not be able to return to his own private school full-time in the fall." 
According to the Post, St. Andrew's Episcopal School, "the Maryland private school that Trump's 
14-year-old son Barron Trump attends, told families that they should prepare for an all-distance 
or hybrid learning model in the fall." 
Pence: Reopening Schools "Is The Best Thing For Our Kids." The AP (7/24) 
reports Vice President Pence "kept up the Trump administration's push for reopening schools 
and universities, insisting Friday that it can be done safely even amid public worries about the 
health risks posed by the coronavirus." The Vice President "told a small audience at Marian 
University in Indianapolis that having children back in classrooms was a necessary step to 
seeing more parents returning to jobs." Said Pence, "Opening up our schools again is the best 
thing for our kids," adding, "It's also the best thing for working families." 
Nursing Homes Say FEMA Sent Them Faulty PPE. 
According to the New York Times (7/24, Jacobs, 18.61M) , "Nursing home employees across the 
country have been dismayed by what they've found when they've opened boxes of protective 
medical gear sent by the federal government, part of a $134 million effort to provide facilities a 
14-day supply of equipment considered critical for shielding their vulnerable residents from the 
coronavirus." The Times says "the shipments have included loose gloves of unknown 
provenance stuffed into unmarked Ziploc bags, surgical masks crafted from underwear fabric 
and plastic isolation gowns without openings for hands that require users to punch their fists 
through the closed sleeves. Adhesive tape must be used to secure them." The Times adds that 
"none of the shipments have included functional N95 respirators, the virus-filtering face masks 
that are the single most important bulwark against infection." The Times reports that FEMA 
"said it had addressed the complaints."
