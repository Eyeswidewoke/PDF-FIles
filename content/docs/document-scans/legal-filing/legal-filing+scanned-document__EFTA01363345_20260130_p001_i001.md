2014 V.I. LEXIS 45, *; 61 V.I. 13, ** 
'marital homestead,' both the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the 
Appellate Division of the District Court interpreted Title 33 V.I.C. §§ 2305(a), (c) to hold 
that a "marital homestead' is any 'homestead' [98] in which a husband and wife both 
reside during the marriage and that is owned by one or both of the spouses." Garcia, 59 
V.I. 758 (V.I. 2013) quoting, Harvey v. Christopher, 55 V.I. 565, 572 (V.I. 2011). 
Pursuant to the parties' stipulation, IB-29 Estate Solberg is valued at Seven Hundred 
Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($725,000.00) subject to a One Hundred Ten Thousand 
Dollars ($110,000.00) mortgage. Although the parties dispute the amount owed to Balbo, 
they acknowledge that ("25] Balbo Construction is owed money for work it has done on 
the homestead:a 
19 See Civil Complaint. Babe v. Jule° Francis 8 Debra Francis. ST-14-CV-188 
Testimony revealed that Dr. Wright-Francis assumed responsibility for the children's 
school tuition and cost of other activities during the course of their marriage. Mr. Francis 
satisfied almost all expenses related to their home including the mortgage property and 
home insurance payments. Since the parties' divorce, the parties have shared equally their 
children's expenses and Mr. Francis has continued to pay all real property expenses. 
Here, the home located at IB-29 Estate Solberg, St. Thomas appears to satisfy the 
requirements outlined in Title 33 V.I.C. § 2305(a) since Mr. Francis gained ownership 
rights when: 1) his mother and sister conveyed the property to him and 2) ['is] the parties 
resided in the home from 2005 until they terminated their marriage in 2012. However, the 
Supreme Court, through Garcia, required that further examination is needed when a 
purported marital homestead is comprised of multiple units like the Solberg property. 
In Garcia, the parties resided in a two level structure that was partitioned of into four (4) 
separate independent apartments. The wife argued that the marital homestead constituted 
all four (4) apartments and consequently, she was entitled to an equitable portion of the 
homestead. The husband opined that all of the apartments should not count towards the 
homestead since "(1) it had a dual nature, as portions of the building were rented to 
tenants, and (2) although Felipe and Edna resided there at some points during their 
marriage, there were large spans of time during which the parties did not occupy it 
together." 59 V.I. 758 (V.I. 2013). Ultimately, the Garcia Court remanded the matter back 
to the Superior Court for further consideration without determining which units comprised 
the marital abode. 
Here, the Solberg property is apportioned into three (3) units. The parties resided in the 
larger unit with their daughters for approximately seven [*2O] (7) years while Mr. Francis' 
mother lived in a smaller unit. The third unit was used as a home office by Mr. Francis, 
until he started to use it as his living quarters after the parties divorced. Unlike Garcia, the 
parties did not use their other units as rental property to produce income. Mr. Francis 
asserted that Joan Francis contributed to her household ["26] expenses for a portion of 
the time she has lived there. It is also important to note that Mr. Francis' mother resided on 
the property first and has been the only other resident.
