Veltri said. "In addition, we are going through media reports and public statements he made that he wanted to 
recruit Afghan soldiers and others to fight for Ukraine." Hawaii News Now (09/18, Huff) noted that the FBI 
descended on an Oahu home Tuesday, looking for evidence against Routh. The FBI evidence collection team arrived 
at his house at about 8 a.m., and an FBI Public Information Officer said they were conducting "court-approved 
activities." 
USSS Makes Pitch for More Resources While Congress Seeks to Hold Them Responsible 
CNN (09/18, Grayer, Cohen) reported that acting USSS Director Ronald Rowe is requesting additional resources 
from Congress following two apparent assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump. The article 
explained that while some lawmakers acknowledge the need for increased funding, others, like House Speaker 
Mike Johnson and Rep. Michael Waltz, express concerns about mismanagement within the agency and demand 
accountability before approving more resources. The article highlighted that the House task force created to 
investigate the assassination attempt against Trump at his July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, is working behind 
the scenes to expand its probe to also include Sunday's apparent assassination attempt. The panel has already 
requested a full briefing with the Department of Justice and FBI by the end of this week on top of continuing their 
ongoing investigation into the first assassination attempt against Trump. 
FBI Agent Leading Trump Assassination Probe Faces Allegations of Anti-Trump Bias 
Fox News (09/18, Colton) also reported that FBI Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey Veltri, who is leading the 
investigation into the second assassination attempt on former President Trump, is facing allegations of anti-Trump 
bias. According to a whistleblower's account presented to Congress last year, Veltri allegedly posted anti-Trump 
rhetoric on social media, although the FBI has dismissed these claims as "demonstrably false." During a Monday 
press conference, Veltri addressed the seriousness of the investigation, stating, "We view this as extremely serious 
and are determined to provide answers as to what led up to the events that took place." He acknowledged that the 
investigation is still in its early stages, saying, "I want to emphasize we are just a little over 24 hours into this 
investigation, so we are going to provide as much as we can publicly while our investigation is ongoing. We must 
also stress the U.S. attorney's office is pursuing charges, and that limits some details we can publicly disclose." 
Despite Veltri's assurances, reports resurfaced regarding a whistleblower's 2022 testimony to the House Judiciary 
Committee, which alleged that Veltri was ordered by the FBI to delete anti-Trump posts from his social media. The 
whistleblower claimed that Veltri's anti-Trump sentiments were well known, and that top FBI officials, including 
Director Wray, instructed him to scrub his accounts to prevent public exposure of his political bias. The FBI has 
reiterated its support for Veltri, stating in response to the resurfaced allegations, "The FBI has full confidence in SAC 
Veltri's leadership of the Miami Field Office and the investigation of the attempted assassination of former 
President Trump. This investigation is of the highest priority of the FBI." The bureau emphasized that the 
investigation involves "hundreds of personnel" from various FBI offices and is being conducted thoroughly and "by 
the book." In addition to the current claims, the whistleblower also alleged that Veltri played a role in improperly 
suspending security clearances for FBI agents with conservative views. The whistleblower's lawyer, Tristan Leavitt, 
has called for a full audit of the FBI's security clearance process, specifically highlighting Veltri and other officials' 
alleged involvement in political bias. 
FBI's Ryan Routh Tip Highlights Vetting Demand Challenge, Former Agent Says 
Fox News (09/19, Coulter) reported that Routh was the subject of an FBI tip in 2019. The tip alleged that Routh was 
a felon in possession of a firearm, but the complainant did not verify the information when interviewed. Former FBI 
Supervisory Special Agent Scott Duffey explained that the FBI receives numerous tips daily, and while tips involving 
threats to life are prioritized, many tips do not lead to interviews or further action if there is no clear violation of 
the law or imminent danger. "If the individual is not coming off as being an imminent danger to themselves, the 
community, or the FBI agent and hasn't given up any information that is incriminating, the FBI agent has the ability 
to write down the information and put it in a file," Duffey said. "Then it will be forever in a file at the FBI. The FBI 
can share or forward that information to local police and say, 'Is there something that you have that could be 
done?'
