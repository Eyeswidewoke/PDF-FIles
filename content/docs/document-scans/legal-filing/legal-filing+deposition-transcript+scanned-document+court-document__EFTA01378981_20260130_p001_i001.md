time to maturity of the securities, and they rely in part on certain assumptions about future events, which may prove to be 
incorrect. 
Because Credit Suisse's pricing models may differ from other issuers' valuation models, and because funding rates taken 
into account by other issuers may vary materially from the rates used by Credit Suisse (even among issuers with similar 
creditworthiness), our estimated value at any time may not be comparable to estimated values of similar securities of other 
issuers. 
• 
EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE USED IN STRUCTURING THE SECURITIES- The internal funding rate we use in 
structuring notes such as these securities is typically lower than the interest rate that is reflected in the yield on our 
conventional debt securities of similar maturity in the secondary market (our "secondary market credit spreads"). If on the 
Trade Date our internal funding rate is lower than our secondary market credit spreads, we expect that the economic terms 
of the securities will generally be less favorable to you than they would have been if our secondary market credit spread 
had been used in structuring the securities. We will also use our internal funding rate to determine the price of the 
securities if we post a bid to repurchase your securities in secondary market transactions. See "—Secondary Market 
Prices" below. 
SECONDARY MARKET PRICES- If Credit Suisse (or an affiliate) bids for your securities in secondary market 
transactions, which we are not obligated to do, the secondary market price (and the value used for account statements or 
otherwise) may be higher or lower than the Price to Public and the estimated value of the securities on the Trade Date. 
The estimated value of the securities on the cover of this pricing supplement does not represent a minimum price at which 
we would be willing to buy the securities in the secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The secondary market price of 
your securities at any time cannot be predicted and will reflect the then-current estimated value determined by reference to 
our pricing models and other factors. These other factors include our internal funding rate, customary bid and ask spreads 
and other transaction costs, changes in market conditions and any deterioration or improvement in our creditworthiness. 
In circumstances where our internal funding rate is lower than our secondary market credit spreads, our secondary market 
bid for your securities could be more favorable than what other dealers might bid because, assuming all else equal, we 
use the lower internal funding rate to price the securities and other dealers might use the higher secondary market credit 
spread to price them. Furthermore, assuming no change in market conditions from the Trade Date, the secondary market 
price of your securities will be lower than the Price to Public because it will not include any discounts or commissions and 
hedging and other transaction costs. If you sell your securities to a dealer in a secondary market transaction, the dealer 
may impose an additional discount or commission, and as a result the price you receive on your securities may be lower 
than the price at which we may repurchase the securities from such dealer. 
We (or an affiliate) may initially post a bid to repurchase the securities from you at a price that will exceed the then-current 
estimated value of the securities. That higher price reflects our projected profit and costs that were included in the Price to 
Public, and that higher price may also be initially used for account statements or otherwise. We (or our affiliate) may offer 
to pay this higher price, for your benefd, but the amount of any excess over the then-current estimated value will be 
temporary and is expected to decline over a period of approximately three months. 
The securities are not designed to be short-term trading instruments and any sale prior to maturity could result in a 
substantial loss to you. You should be willing and able to hold your securities to maturity. 
• 
CREDIT SUISSE IS SUBJECT TO SWISS REGULATION—As a Swiss bank, Credit Suisse is subject to regulation by 
governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and self-regulatory organizations in Switzerland. Such regulation is 
increasingly more extensive and complex and subjects Credit Suisse to risks. For example, pursuant to Swiss banking 
laws, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) may open resolution proceedings if there are justified 
concerns that Credit Suisse is over-indebted, has serious liquidity problems or no longer fulfills capital adequacy 
requirements. FINMA has broad powers and discretion in the case of resolution proceedings, which include the power to 
convert debt instruments and other liabilities of Credit Suisse into equity and/or cancel such liabilities in whole or in part. If 
one or more of these measures were imposed, such measures may adversely affect the terms and market value of the 
securities and/or the ability of Credit Suisse to make payments thereunder and you may not receive any amounts owed to 
you under the securities. 
• 
LACK OF LIQUIDITY- The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange. Credit Suisse (or its affiliates) intends 
to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but is not required to do so. Even if there is a secondary 
market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities when you wish to do so. Because 
other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities, the price at which you may be able to trade your 
securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Credit Suisse (or its affiliates) is willing to buy the securities. If 
you have to sell your securities prior to maturity, you may not be able to do so or you may have to sell them at a 
substantial loss. 
• 
POTENTIAL CONFLICTS- We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities, 
including acting as calculation agent and as agent of the issuer for the offering of the securities, hedging our obligations 
under the securities and determining their estimated value. In performing these duties, the economic interests of us and 
our affiliates are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities. Further, hedging activities may 
adversely affect any payment on or the value of the securities. Any profit in connection with such hedging activities will be
