2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
A. Legal standard 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(h) provides that, "[i]n a certified class action, the court 
may award reasonable attorney's fees that are authorized by law or by the parties' 
agreement." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h). A "thorough judicial r59] review of fee applications is 
required in all class action settlements." GM Truck Prods., 55 F.3d at 819. "Determining an 
appropriate award is not an exact science," and the "facts of each individual case drive the 
amount of any award." In re AremisSoft Corp. Sec. Litig. ("AremisSoft"), 210 F.R.D. 109, 
128 (D.N.J. 2002). 
The Third Circuit has established two methods for evaluating an award of attorneys' fees: 
the percentage-of-recovery method, which involves giving attorneys a portion of the total 
damages awarded to plaintiffs, and the lodestar method, which involves multiplying the 
number of hours reasonably worked on a case by the reasonable billing rate for the 
services. Prudential, 148 F.3d at 333; In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig. ("Ins. 
Brokerage"), 579 F.3d 241, 280 (3d Cir. 2009) (citing In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig. ("Rite 
Aid"), 396 F.3d 294, 302 (3d Cir. 2005)). The percentage-of-recovery method is generally 
favored in cases involving a common fund, while the lodestar method "is more commonly 
applied in statutory fee-shifting cases." Prudential, 148 F.3d at 333. The lodestar method 
may also be applied "in cases where the nature of the recovery does not allow the 
determination of the settlement's value necessary for application of the percentage-of-
recovery method." Id. (citing GM Truck Prods., 55 F.3d at 821). The court should perform a 
"cross-check" by comparing the fee award r60] calculated under the chosen method with 
the award calculated under the alternative method. Ins. Brokerage, 579 F.3d at 280 (citing 
Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 300). 
"The party seeking attorney's fees has the burden to prove that its request for attorney's 
fees is reasonable."' Rode v. Dellarciprete, 892 F.2d 1177, 1183 (3d Cir. 1990) (quoting 
Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983)). "In a 
statutory fee case, the parting opposing the fee award then has the burden to challenge . 
. the reasonableness of the requested fee." Id. (citing Bell v. United Princeton Props., Inc., 
884 F.2d 713 (3d Cir. 1989)). 
B. Analysis 
1. The Court applies the lodestar method of fee calculation 
The Court agrees with all Parties that the lodestar method is the proper method of fee 
calculation for this matter. See ECF No. 86 at 17; ECF No. 90 at 1. Plaintiffs bring a cause 
of action on behalf of the entire N14 Class under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, which 
provides for statutory fee-shifting. ECF No. 86 at 17 (citing 15 U.S.C. § 2310(d)(2) 
(allowing consumers to recover "a sum equal to the aggregate amount of cost and 
expenses (including attorneys' fees based on actual time expended) determined by the 
court to have reasonably incurred by the plaintiff . . . ."). The lodestar method is also 
appropriate because the settlement award to N14 Class members also does not consist of 
a single, predetermined, common fund from which a percentage-of-recovery can r61] be 
easily calculated. Instead, the settlement includes a "non-monetary" provision -- the
