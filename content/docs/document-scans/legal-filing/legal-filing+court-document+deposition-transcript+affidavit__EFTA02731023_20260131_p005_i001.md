At the time the 2006 GRATs were funded, the assets in the remainder trust had an 
appraised value of approximately $585 million.16 The assets in the remainder trust comprised of 
your interest in various Apollo partnerships prior to Apollo's initial public offering, which your 
advisors believed could reasonably be expected to increase in value over time to an amount 
exceeding $2 billion." Operating on the basis of a tax rate of 40% to 50% for net federal and 
state estate taxes, the estimated tax liability resulting from these assets being included in your 
estate at time of death could have exceeded $1 billion. 18
In order to prevent the Apollo assets in the remainder trust from being subject to gift and 
estate taxes, you consulted with Epstein and retained established trust and estate lawyers from 
Weil Gotshal and Paul Weiss to devise a solution. Epstein proposed that the trustees of the trust 
prepare an accounting to ascertain the amount of income that was distributable to you under the 
remainder trust agreement compared to the amounts that were in fact distributed to you.1° That 
accounting revealed that you had been over-distributed income by the trustees of the remainder 
trust?' This review also revealed that the trustees distributed income to you from assets other 
than those identified in the remainder trust agreement.' As a result of these overpayments, your 
advisors believed that the trustees of the remainder trust agreement had a claim against you to 
claw back excess distributions.' Conversely, had the trustees removed you as a beneficiary of 
the remainder trust, you could have alleged a claim for breach of fiduciary duty."
