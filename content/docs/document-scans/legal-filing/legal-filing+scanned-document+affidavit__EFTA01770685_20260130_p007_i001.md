leaders are less well known. Some diplomats fear =hat Syrian Islamists could ride to power amid the turmoil, imposing 
an age=da that might clash with Western goals. 
That may be one rea=on the United States is hoping the Syrian National Council can overcome it= divisions and 
shortcomings. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a press conference in London<=a>, moved the United States 
a step closer to recognizing the council. <http://www.state.govisecretary/rm/2012/02/184577.htm> 
"They will have a=seat at the table as a representative of the Syrian people," Mrs. Clinto= said. "And we think it's 
important to have Syrians represented.=And the consensus opinion by the Arab League and all the others who are 
working and planning this conference is that the S.=.C. is a credible representative." 
Council members des=ribe opposition divisions as a natural result of trying to forge a working=organization that 
encompasses wide diversity from a complex society that h=s known only oppression. 
Indeed, the men at =he Four Seasons in Doha ranged from the various Islamist representatives w=th suits, ties and 
neatly trimmed beards to the one Christian on the execu=ive committee, a longtime university professor in Belgium who 
wandered around in flip-flops. 
The council members=contend that progress has been made among a group of people who were virtu=l strangers when 
they first gathered in Istanbul in September, and that sn=ping about their unrepresentative nature is mostly a 
disinformation campaign by Damascus. 
"This is a manufa=tured problem," said Burhan Ghalioun, the council president, in a brief =nterview outside an executive 
committee meeting last week. "Some indepen=ent people don't want to join the S.N.C., but there is no strong 
opposition power outside the national council." <=span> 
He said lack of mon=y was the group's most acute problem. Although the Qatari government pic=ed up the bill for the 
Doha meeting and for frequent travel, council membe=s said that no significant financial support from Arab or Western 
governments had materialized despite repeated=promises, so they must rely on rich Syrian exiles. They hope Friday's 
me=ting in Tunis will begin to change that. 
After communicating=via Skype with activists in embattled cities like Homs, Hama and Idlib, co=ncil members admitted 
sheepishly that those activists just flung accusatio=s at them, demanding to know why they seemed to swan from one 
luxury hotel to the next while no medical supplies=or other aid flowed into Syria. 
The bickering takes=place in plain sight. "Is this any way to work?" yelled Haithem al-Mal=h, an 81-year-old lawyer and 
war horse of the opposition movement, as he c=me barreling out of one Doha meeting, only to be corralled back in. 
"They are all stupid and silly, but what can I =o?" 
The 310-member coun=il remains Balkanized among different factions; arguments unspool endlessl= over which groups 
deserve how many seats. The mostly secular, liberal rep=esentatives and those from the Islamist factions harbor mutual 
suspicions. 
No one from Syria=92s ruling Alawite community, the small religious sect of Mr. Assad, sits =n the executive committee, 
despite repeated attempts to woo a few prominen= dissidents. The fight over Kurdish seats remains unsettled even 
though Massoud Barzani, a leading Kurd in neighbori=g Iraq, tried to mediate. 
The council has als= not reconciled with members of another opposition coalition, the Syrian N=tional Coordination 
Committee, some of whom remain in Syria and who have g=nerally taken a softer line about allowing Mr. Assad to 
shepherd a political transition.
