Electronic monitoring 
As well as being used as a condition of bail or to enable 
early release from prison, electronic monitoring can also 
be imposed as a sentence following conviction for an 
offence. Introduced nationally in 1999, community 
orders using electronic monitoring require an offender to 
stay at a particular address during specified times. 
usually overnight. Two types of electronic monitoring are 
currently available, both involve a 'tag' on the ankle: 
• radio frequency technology alerts a monitoring 
company when offenders go 'out of range' (usually as 
a result of leaving their house); 
• satellite tracking uses the GPS system to track an 
offender's whereabouts away from the home address. 
A Home Office evaluation of electronic monitoring6
showed that 80% of offenders successfully completed 
their curfew orders but two year reconviction rates were 
fairly high, at 73% (compared with 66% for those 
serving custodial sentences)! 
Early intervention 
The government has launched a number of initiatives in 
an attempt to tackle the underlying causes of offending 
and to steer young offenders away from crime. These 
include a new youth justice system and initiatives such 
as the Surestart scheme which aims to bring together 
early education, healthcare and family support. A key 
component of the youth justice system is the multi-
agency Youth Offending Teams found in local authorities 
in England and Wales. These assess specific problems 
that make a young person offend, and the risk an 
offender poses to others, and identify suitable 
interventions to address each young offender's needs 
with the intention of preventing further offences. 
Social and psychological variables associated with 
whether or not an individual becomes involved in 
offending are well documented. They include: 
• 'problematic' behaviours of childhood such as bullying 
and aggressiveness; 
• 'teenage anti-social behaviours' such as substance 
use, sexual activity and gambling; 
• problems at school; 
• poor family relationships; 
• economic and social factors such as poverty. 
Where such factors are identified, it may be possible to 
target those at highest risk of offending through early 
interventions. These may include parental approaches, 
where parents are provided with support and advice, or 
family-based approaches, such as providing foster care 
treatment for young people with poor family 
relationships. Young people with several risk factors may 
need multi-pronged service provision. There is evidence 
that such early interventions can be effective (see Box 3 
for an example) in reducing anti-social behaviour and 
offending and truancy rates. In general, interventions are 
most effective when they:8
• match the specific needs of the young person; 
• are targeted to changing specific behaviours and 
include training in social skills and problem solving; 
Box 3 Rainer's Rapid Action Project (RAP) 
Rainer's RAP is an early intervention scheme that offers 
support for young people whom the police have identified 
as being 'at risk' of offending or who have committed their 
first minor offence. Outreach youth workers based in police 
stations take referrals: a key strength of the project is its 
early response and support for young people and their 
families. The project also has the capacity to signpost those 
most at risk to specialist services/agencies in order to deal 
with any other problems contributing to offending 
behaviour. An internal evaluation revealed that 1% of young 
people who engaged with the project went on to offend' 
• are well structured, planned and monitored; 
• stay true to the original programme (if the intervention 
is based on a published model) while allowing 
flexibility to adapt an intervention to individual needs; 
• are designed to intervene across several contexts at 
once, which may mean involving people from different 
domains of the young person's life; 
• are long-lasting and well resourced. 
ISSUES 
Effectiveness 
There is evidence from studies abroad that community 
approaches to sentencing can have positive outcomes. 
In the UK, Ministry of Justice research shows that 
participation in a group programme can reduce the 
chances of reconviction for some offenders.1° An 
evaluation of adult offenders found that those sentenced 
to a Community Punishment Order had the lowest re-
offending rate (40%) compared with those sentenced to 
prison (66%).7 A crude comparison of Community 
Punishment and/or Rehabilitation Orders and a 
comparison sample of those who received a lesser 
sentence (i.e. no supervision from probation services)11
revealed that those issued with a Community 
Punishment Order had a lower reconviction rate than 
those on Community Rehabilitation Orders. 
Less evidence is available to assess which of the 12 
requirements are likely to be most effective in achieving 
the desired sentence outcomes. A report on the 
supervision of community orders in England and Wales 
by the National Audit Office (NAO) recommended that 
the Ministry of Justice "identify the degree to which the 
twelve...requirements reduce reconvictions and achieve 
other sentencing outcomes". It suggested this might be 
achieved through a longitudinal study assessing similar 
groups of offenders given different types of sentences.12
Costs 
Community sentences are often regarded as a cost-
effective alternative to custodial sentences. However, 
this depends on two main factors. First, there is the cost 
of administering community sentences compared with 
the costs of alternatives such as custodial sentences. 
Estimates suggest that the average annual cost per young 
adult prisoner is over £34,000.13 While the average cost 
of community sentences is likely to be lower than this, 
the actual cost of a sentence will vary depending on the
