Energy innovation i= taking many forms in the United States, creating major export opportuniti=s and giving Washington 
the tools it needs to ensure that the conditions o= a 1973-style oil embargo will not repeat themselves. The oil embargo 
was so devastating because strong econo=ic growth throughout the 1960s had taken up the margin of spare oil-
produc=ive capacity in the United States and across the world, leaving the Middle=East's oil producers with undue 
monopoly power. Similar razor-thin extra productive capacity left markets =ighly vulnerable in 2006 and 2007, when 
OPEC made contraseasonal cuts in o=tput to increase prices, instead of considering the risks to global econom=c growth. 
But as oil and gas production from U.S. and Canadian shale formations rises, the ability of oil producer= like Russia to use 
an "energy weapon" to gain extra benefits fr=m consuming countries is diminishing. 
U.S.-led innovation=in alternative fuels (including natural gas-vehicle fueling technology and=electric vehicles), energy-
efficiency technologies, battery storage, and s=art-grid solutions, working together with and complementing the supply 
surge in unconventional oil and gas, sho=ld also change the face of demand, giving consumers around the world more 
=reedom of choice. And as the United States becomes an energy exporter -- a= competitive prices -- that should seal the 
deal. By providing ready alternatives to politicized energy supplres, the United States can use its influence to 
democratize global energy m=rkets, much the way smartphone and social media technologies have ended th= lock on 
information and communications by repressive governments and large multinational or state-run corporation=. 
Abundant U.S. natur=l gas is just the first step. Booming domestic natural gas supplies have a=ready displaced and 
defanged Russia's and Iran's grip on natural gas buyer=. By significantly reducing American domestic requirements for 
imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), rising U.S= shale gas production has had the knock-on effect of increasing 
alternativ= LNG supplies to Europe, breaking down fixed pricing from entrenched monop=lies. But this is just the 
beginning: Over the coming decade, the United States looks likely to overtake Russia =nd rival Qatar as a leading supplier 
of natural gas to international marke=s. 
The geopolitical ro=e of U.S. natural gas surpluses in constraining Russia's ability to use it= energy as a wedge between 
the United States and its European and Asian al=ies should strengthen over time, to the extent that Barack Obama's 
administration stays the course with approv=ng the construction of LNG export terminals. American unconventional oil 
a=d gas plays from Texas to Pennsylvania are also generating new su=pluses of natural gas liqui=s, which are increasingly 
exported as transportation fuel or petrochemical=feedstock to Europe, Asia, and elsewhere -- reducing demand growth 
for oil from the Middle East. And U.S. crude oil=exports might also be possible some day, strengthening America's lead in 
m=rket-related pricing for kingpin crude oil, much the way rising North Sea =roduction did in the 1980s. 
As an increasing nu=ber of companies and investors flock to North America to develop prolific =nconventional resources, 
Middle East heavyweights like Saudi Arabia, Kuwai=, and Iran are losing their lock on remaining exploitable reserves, 
reducing their ability to band together an= create artificial shortages. Already, Mexico and Argentina are reading th= tea 
leaves and reversing protectionist resource nationalism policies, ins=ead pushing through reforms to attract capital 
investment to their doorsteps. 
Abundant U.S. natur=l gas is also spawning new American-designed engine and modular fueling st=tion technologies to 
readily use natural gas as a fuel in trucks, trains, =nd ships, ending oil's monopoly in transport. Some 40 m b/d of the 
global 85 m b/d oil market is open for competiti=n from natural gas -- in th= form of compressed natural gas for cars and 
buses, and LNG for heavy-duty vehicles and marine transportation. We c=nservatively expect at least 2 m b/d of 
currently projected oil demand to =ede to natural gas by 2020, further weakening perspectives on future globa= oil-
demand growth and once again chipping away at Middle Eastern influence. 
American innovation=and exports of energy supply and technology will open global energy market= to competitive 
investments and consumer choice. But Washington needs to e=brace this choice by resisting the call to continue to ban 
energy exports to protect vested business interest= or for resource nationalistic reasons. Indeed, we need to reverse the 
min=set of the oil embargo years -- a mindset of supply shortages and husbandi=g of resources -- and move back to a 
more traditional promotion of free markets. The energy sector has don= this in the trade of petroleum products, where 
the United States is simul=aneously the world's largest importer and exporter. The United States is h=ading in this same 
direction for trade in natural gas, whether by pipeline to Mexico and eastern Canada or =he export of LNG. And it should
