Iran has made clear=it has no intention of suspending the enrichment of low-enriched uranium, =ither under an interim 
agreement or as part of a comprehensive accord. 
But American offici=ls still want to curb Iran's ability to make a bomb in a matter of month.. This could be done by 
banning Iran from enriching uranium to 20 percent =nd arranging for Iran to convert its current stock of such uranium 
into oxide form, which is harder to convert =o weapons grade. Such a step, many experts say, would be more effective 
if=it was also coupled with constraints on the number and type of centrifuges=Iran is permitted to retain. 
"If there aren'= more constraints put on the Iranian centrifuge program, then you haven'= accomplished very much at 
all," David Albright, the president of the Wa=hington-based Institute for Science and International Security, said on a 
recent conference call organized by the Israel Project= a nonprofit organization. 
American officials =re believed to have sought a commitment by Iran that it would not operate =ophisticated 
centrifuges, known as IR-2s, or install new ones. Banning Ira= from manufacturing additional centrifuges of all types 
would also slow progress toward a bomb, but Mr. Albright said=it might not be part of the Obama administration's 
proposal. 
To induce Iran to h=lt its program, the United States is proposing freeing up billions of doll=rs in Iranian funds that have 
been frozen in banks overseas, and could be =iven to Iran in installments in return for concessions. But on Friday, an 
Iranian negotiator said Iran expected r=lief from sweeping sanctions against its oil and banking industries. "We=have 
announced to the West that in the first phase the issue of banking an= oil sanctions must be considered," said the 
representative, Majid Takht•Ravanchi, according to the Iranian ners agency Mehr. 
Mr. Takht-Ravanchi =s a seasoned diplomat, but his statement seemed out of character for an Ir=nian delegation that 
has worked hard to raise expectations for an agreemen=. 
In any event, the broader sanctions can be lifted only with congressional approval, a lengthy =rid political difficult 
process, given the strong sentiment among lawmakers=to keep the pressure on Iran. The Senate, in fact, is considering 
additional sanctions, and agreed only to delay the=bill briefly to avoid disrupting the initial rounds of talks. 
News of a potential=agreement prompted several Republican lawmakers to express concern that th= major powers 
were about to reward Iran without removing its nuclear capab=lities. Their criticism followed a blistering denunciation of 
the potential deal by Prime Minister Benjamin N=tanyahu of Israel. 
"The agreement wo=Id leave Iran's nuclear infrastructure in place while undermining the sa=ctions pressure we worked 
so hard to build," said Senator Mark S. Kirk, =n Illinois Republican and Iran hawk. "In short, it will increase the likelihood 
of war when we should be doing all =e can to achieve a peaceful outcome." 
Representative Ed R=yce, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affair= Committee, said he 
would hold hearings on the negotiations with Iran to c=incide with the 100th day since the election of Hassan Rouhani as 
president of Iran — the political change t=at opened the door to the most serious diplomacy in a decade. 
"Instead of tough=ning sanctions to get meaningful and lasting concessions, the Obama admini=tration looks to be 
settling for interim and reversible steps," Mr. Royc= said in a statement. "A partial freeze of enrichment, as we're 
hearing, is not a freeze." 
If Mr. Kerry succee=s in closing an interim deal, one of his first orders of business is likel= to be lobbying his former 
colleagues in the Senate to support the agreeme=t and to hold off on new sanctions. Mr. Kerry had planned to visit 
Algeria and Morocco, but he postponed those=visits to return to Washington by early next week.
