S•1/A 
Table of Contrail 
by the NYSE. the authorized shares of preferred stock will be available for issuance without further action by you. Our Board is able to determine, 
with respect to any series of preferred stock, the terms and rights of that series, including: 
the designation of the series; 
• 
the number of shares of the series, which our Board may, except where otherwise provided in the preferred stock designation, increase 
(but not above the total number of authorized shares of the class) or decrease (but not below the number of shares then outstanding); 
whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or non-cumulativc and the dividend rate of the series; 
• 
the dates at which dividends, if any. will be payable; 
• 
the redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of the series; 
• 
the terms and amounts of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of shares of the series; 
• 
the amounts payable on shares of the series in the event of any voluntary• or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the 
affairs of our Company; 
• 
whether the shams of the series will be convertible into shares of any other class or wiles, or any other security, of our Company or any 
other corporation. and. if so. the specification of the other class or series or other security, the conversion price or prices or rate or rates. 
any rate adjustments. the date or dates as of which the shares will be convertible and all other terms and conditions upon which the 
conversion may be made: 
• 
restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same series or of any other class or series; and 
• 
the voting rights, if any, of the holders of the series. 
We could issue a series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of the series, impede or discourage an acquisition attempt 
or other transaction that some, or a majority, of you might believe to be in your best interests or in which you might receive a premium for your 
Class A common stock over the market price of the Class A common stock. Additionally. the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the 
holders of our Class A common stock by restricting dividends on the Class A common stock, diluting the voting power of the Class A common 
stock or subordinating the liquidation rights of the Class A common stock. As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of preferred stock 
could have an adverse impact on the market price of our Class A common stock. 
Dividends 
The DGCL pennits a corporation to declare and pay dividends out of "surplus- or. if there is no "surplus," out of its net profits for the 
fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. "Surplus" is defined as the excess of the net assets of the corporation 
over the amount determined to be the capital of the corporation by the Board. The capital of the corporation is typically calculated to be (and cannot 
be less than) the aggregate par value of all issued shares of capital stock. Net assets equals the fair value of the total assets minus total liabilities. 
The DGCL also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits if, after the payment of the dividend, capital is less than the capital 
represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. 
Declaration and payment of any dividend will be subject to the discretion of our Board. The time and amount of dividends will be 
dependent upon our financial condition, operations, cash requirements and availability, debt repayment obligations, capital expenditure needs and 
restrictions in our debt instruments, industry trends, the provisions of Delaware law affecting the payment of dividends to stockholders and any 
other factors our Board may consider relevant.
