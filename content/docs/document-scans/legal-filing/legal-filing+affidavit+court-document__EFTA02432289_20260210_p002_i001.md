current role or some other role that gives me more freedom. I have a strong management 
team that doesn't require much oversight anymore which helps. 
My nightmare is surviving the next 3, 4, 5 months to get us there. I went in to the holidays 
with 8 different sources promising me checks and each and every one of them disappearing 
despite making every effort to get them to honor their commitments. In the end I know it 
will all come together. There are too many wealthy people invested to let us fail. Its just 
shameful for me to have to go back to them yet again with a far more conservative business 
plan (in terms of timeline — downstream the plan supports a lot more upside.) But in the 
current environment everyone wants to cash out. And I don't see that happening until we 
can get our arsenal of products launched end of 2010. 
We have developed a pipeline of high quality, competitively differentiated, low cost, 
adaptable products that can be used in a range of medical settings. We have an incredible 
relationship with the FDA and they are simply waiting for us to funnel through our products. 
But instead of focusing on getting these cool products through FDA I am scrambling around 
trying to squeeze blood out of rocks. 
Anyway the thing I need the most right now is a bridge to get me over this troubled water. 
From what I can read of Nathan Wolfe, he has done a phenomenal job of not only working on 
interesting projects but building bridges to the right resources to allow him to develop a 
reputation of significance on a topic he cares deeply about. I have A LOT to learn from 
Nathan. I care deeply about the topic of infectious diseases. I am particularly interested in 
the interplay between infection and chronic disease. I would love to talk to Nathan about 
XMRV and its potential role in prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. 
Jeff Bezos divides leaders up into visionaries, missionaries and mercenaries. As much as I am 
sweating it out trying to be a good missionary and sometimes even a mercenary, I am likely 
to be happiest as a visionary primarily enjoying life and the people I want to enjoy life (going 
to more raves!) The path forward will be dependent on how to architect the bridge to cross 
over to the other side. 
These are my thoughts I am all ears and happy to listen to any of yours or Nathan's. I can also 
answer the questions you posed to Boris re: my business if we speak over the phone.
