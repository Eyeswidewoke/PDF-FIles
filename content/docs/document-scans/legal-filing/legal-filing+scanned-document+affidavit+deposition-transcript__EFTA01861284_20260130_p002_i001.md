Libya rebels desperately short of funds - latimes.com

down the credit line. 
About $100 million donated by Qatar has nearly been spent, Ramadan said, and $200 million promised 
by Turkey has yet to arrive. Several tankers loaded with fuel from Europe have left the Benghazi port 
without unloading after the council couldn't pay cash, he said. 
The vast petrochemical complexes at Port Brega and Ras Lanuf, seized from the rebels by government 
forces this spring, have been shut down. Also closed is the natural gas pipeline that normally fuels 
electricity production in Benghazi and other eastern cities. 
That means that rebel leaders in the country that is the world's 17th-largest producer of oil must import 
all their fuel. Several nations have promised to provide cash, Ramadan said, but only Qatar has 
delivered. 
"We hear a lot of promises, but it's a lot easier to promise than to deliver," he said. "We don't count on it 
unless it's sitting in our account." 
Ramadan said he is pursuing new credit lines. His two cellphones rang constantly as he spoke. 
The council has sought loan guarantees backed by billions of dollars in frozen Libyan government assets 
overseas. But weeks of negotiations have failed to pry loose guarantees, Ramadan said. 
In a July 7 letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, four U.S. senators led by Sen. John 
McCain (R-Ariz.) asked Clinton to help unlock the assets for Libyan humanitarian aid. The letter 
reminded Clinton of her recent promise to help put the rebel council "on firmer financial footing." 
Rebel finances "are in a perilous state," the letter said. 
The United States has authorized $25 million in nonlethal military assistance to the rebels and $53 
million in humanitarian aid. But Ramadan said loan guarantees backed by frozen Libyan assets would 
have a much bigger effect on the effort to topple Kadafi, a declared U.S. policy goal. 
The main crisis in the east is financial, not humanitarian. Thanks to unusually heavy winter rains, 
eastern Libya is flush with grains, fruits and vegetables. 
Many shops and restaurants have reopened in recent weeks, stocked with goods imported from Europe 
and the Middle East through rebel-controlled ports in Benghazi and Tobruk and overland through Egypt. 
"Yes, we have food, but what good is it if people don't have the cash to pay for it?" said Mustafa 
Gheriani, a former council spokesman now in business. 
Britain has rejected council requests to deliver 1.4 billion Libyan dinars ($1.15 billion) printed by a 
British company and impounded in London, Ramadan said. Millions of dollars in cash reserves that 
were in the Libyan national bank branch in Benghazi when the eastern rebellion erupted in mid-
February have been spent. 
To conserve currency, banks that recently reopened in Benghazi now limit customers to monthly 
withdrawals of 200 Libyan dinars, equivalent to $165, Gheriani said. 
Ironically, the one commodity people can still afford is gasoline, which sells for about 45 U.S. cents a 
gallon, cheaper than bottled water. The council has decided not to raise gasoline prices, which are set by
