IPI's work on polio eradication is the first step in a broader, long-term initiative on peace and health. As 
stated in the World Health Organization's Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (1986), peace is a 
primary condition for health. Instability makes people and communities more vulnerable to disease, and 
prevents them from living healthy and productive lives. For example, polio is proving hardest to 
eradicate in regions of some of the world's most unstable countries: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and 
Somalia. Conversely, stability fosters an environment conducive to providing humanitarian and 
development assistance. Therefore, IPI is launching a peace and health initiative to better understand 
the links between peace and health, and to generate policy support to reduce vulnerability and increase 
resilience to health-related problems that contribute to instability, and conversely, to mitigate sources of 
instability that threaten health. 
The initiative aims to become a thought and policy leader on the connection between health and 
stability— understanding the links and their negative aspects, and promoting remedial solutions. This is 
vital since peace and health interact in many different ways. The most significant, and malign, link is the 
fact that people are killed, injured, disabled, abused, or traumatized due to armed conflict. Conflict 
prevention, mediation, and peacebuilding are therefore vital for saving lives. In addition, armed conflict 
has indirect effects on global health. These include: 
1) impeding access of health professionals and humanitarian agencies to populations in need 
(conflict-affected countries have on average less than one health professional per 10,000 
people); 
2) "flight" of health professionals from conflict zones for safety issues (health workers are 
often targeted by government security forces as well) as we are currently witnessing in 
Syria and Somalia; 
3) lack of supplies and basic equipment in hospitals and clinics in conflict zones, as well as 
difficult and unsafe access to health facilities for populations in need, also due to 
deterioration of infrastructure and transportation; 
4) decrease in government expenditure on healthcare; 
5) food shortages due to damaged agricultural structures, collapse of the economy, aid 
deliberately withheld, and disruption of the family unit; 
6) three to four times higher under-5 child mortality rates in conflict zones than in the rest of 
the world; 
7) sharp decline in basic childhood immunization in conflict zones; 
8) highest rates of maternal deaths due to childbirth complications and other debilitating 
conditions in conflict-ridden or post-conflict states; 
9) increased incidents of sexual violence towards women and children, with greater numbers 
of sexually transmitted diseases, as well physical and psychological trauma; and 
10) increased incidence of infectious diseases (malaria, cholera, measles) during conflict due 
to malnutrition, unsanitary conditions, lack of clean water, etc. 
These factors create a vicious cycle. Greater instability endangers health, while greater vulnerability 
(including disease) breeds instability. Indeed, states characterized as fragile or failed (including those 
that have high rates of polio) tend to have far worse population health indicators than states at 
comparable levels of development. As of today, for example, no low-income fragile or conflict-affected 
country has yet achieved a single Millennium Development Goal (MDGs). Poor health indicators are a 
product of inadequate governance and service development. Moreover, fragile states tend to be affected 
by humanitarian crises that endure for years. In other words, a context of continuing crises and 
emergencies, combined with weak or non-existent local and national institutions, can undermine health 
improvements or nullify health investments and programs in the long-term.
