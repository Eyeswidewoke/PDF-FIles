General Events 
• Brooking Institution: Transitions: Planning and staffing a presidency
,
 — Thursday, November 21, 2024. 
Location: The Brookings Institution, 10:00 AM. Newly elected presidents have 11 weeks to translate their 
electoral victory into a governing agenda and team. The two priorities go hand in hand, and successful 
transitions address both challenges at the same time. That includes strategic and operational choices in 
setting out a legislative and governing agenda, as well as confirming approximately 1,300 executive branch 
officials and filling judicial vacancies. 
• Heritage: Nuclear Revolution: Powering the Next Generation — Thursday, November 21, 2024. Location: 
Online event, 11:00 AM. Please join us for this special event where Jack Spencer will be discussing his new 
book, Nuclear Revolution: Powering the Next Generation, in which he argues that for nuclear energy to meet 
America's growing energy demand, we need to think beyond a nuclear renaissance and towards a nuclear 
revolution; a revolution animated by the American spirit, molded by free enterprise, and delivered by the 
private sector. 
• CSIS: Preventing  Detecting  and Responding to Animal Disease Threats: 20 Years of UN FAO ECTAD —
Thursday, November 21, 2024. Location: CSIS, 10:30 AM. Today, up to 75 percent of emerging infectious 
diseases originate from animal sources, posing outsized risks to livestock health, agricultural production and 
trade, and human security. From the African swine fever to the highly pathogenic avian influenza, the socio-
economic and health threats posed by transboundary animal diseases are vast and far-reaching. Established 
in 2004, the UN FAO Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) implements the largest 
animal health capacity development programming globally, supporting countries in forecasting, preventing, 
detecting, and responding to high-impact transboundary animal diseases. 
• CATO Institute: A Life for Liberty: The Making of an American Originalist — Thursday, November 21, 2024. 
Location: CATO Institute, 1:00 PM. Georgetown University law professor Randy Barnett has played an 
integral role in the rise of originalism—the movement to identify, restore, and defend the original meaning 
of the Constitution. But Barnett's path to becoming an influential professor of constitutional law was not an 
easy one. Starting from a working-class childhood in Calumet City, Illinois, Barnett's unusual resume has 
included stints as an ice cream truck driver, newspaper ad salesman, prosecutor, libertarian theorist, 
contract law professor, and Supreme Court advocate. In his new autobiography, A Life for Liberty, Barnett 
tells the complete story of his personal and professional journey. 
• Aspen Institute: Socrates San Francisco — Is technology the new religion? — Thursday, November 21, 2024. 
Location: The Institute at Salesforce Park, 6:00 PM. As our unified social values fragment and organized 
religion falls to the lowest levels of participation on record, people are seeking meaning. Belief in biohacking 
and the singularity now resemble tenets of a new faith. Since before the advent of the printing press and the 
Gutenberg Bible, technology and religion have had a complex and mutually beneficial relationship. While 
technology in the past augmented religion, join us as we ponder whether technology has itself become a 
new religion. 
• PIIE: Small  packages big questions: Valuing the de minimis exemption — Thursday, November 21, 2024. 
Location: Online event, 9:00 AM. The United States allows international shipments with a fair market value 
of $800 or less to enter the country duty free. US Customs and Border Protection (CPB) processes about 4 
million of these de minimis shipments a day, up from 2.8 million a day last year. Federal lawmakers are 
considering legislation that would significantly alter or eliminate the de minimis exemption.
