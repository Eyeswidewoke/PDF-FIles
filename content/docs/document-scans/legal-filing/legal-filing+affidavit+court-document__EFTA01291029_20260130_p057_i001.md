not available are marked "N/A"' and are omitted from the Total.

and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making investment, trading, otters decisions. These figures assume that the position 
quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant. A capital gain or return of principal may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to 
wvriv.pershing.cornlbusiness_continuity.html for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received.

reduced by the amount of shares on loan. The Proxy Voting Instruction Form sent to you may reflect a smaller number of shares entitled to vote than the number of shares in your margin account. 
Foreign Currency Transactions 
Pershing may execute foreign currency transactions as principal for your account. Pershing may automatically convert foreign currency to or from U.S. dolars for dividends and similar corporate action 
transactions unless you instruct your financial organization otherwise. Pershing's currency conversion rate will not exceed the highest interbank conversion rate identified from customary banking sources on the 
conversion date or the prior business day, increased by up to 1%, unless a particular rate is required by applicable law. Your financial organization may also increase the currency conversion rate. This conversion 
rate may differ from rates in effect on the date you executed a transaction, Mound a charge, or received a credit. Transactions converted by agents (such as depositories) will be billed at the rates such agents 
use.
