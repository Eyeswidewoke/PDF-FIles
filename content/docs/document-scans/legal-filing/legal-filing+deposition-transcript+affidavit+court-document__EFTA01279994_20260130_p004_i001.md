("Property Address"): 
TO HAVE AND TO HOLD this property unto Trustee and Trustee's successors and assigns, forever, 
together with all the improvements now or hereafter erected on the property, and all easements, 
appurtenances, and fixtures now or hereafter a part of the property. All replacements and additions shall 
also be covered by this Security Instrument. All of the foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument 
as the "Property." 
BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seised of the estate hereby conveyed and has the 
right to grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of 
record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and 
demands, subject to any encumbrances of record. 
THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform covenants 
with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real property. 
Uniform Covenants. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows: 
1. 
Payment of Principal, Interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges. 
Borrower shall pay when due the principal of, and interest on. the debt evidenced by the Note and 
any prepayment charges and late charges due under the Note. Borrower shall also pay funds for 
Escrow Items pursuant to Section 3. Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument shall 
be made in U.S. currency. However, if any check or other instrument received by Lender as 
payment under the Note or this Security Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may 
require that any or all subsequent payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument be 
made in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; 
(c) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check or cashier's check, provided any such check is 
drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; 
or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer. 
Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at 
such other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in 
Section 15. Lender may return any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments 
are insufficient to bring the Loan current. If Borrower has breached any covenant or agreement in 
this Security Instrument and Lender has accelerated the obligations of Borrower hereunder pursuant 
to Section 22 then Lender may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan 
current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or 
partial payments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such payments at the time such 
payments are accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then Lender 
need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower 
makes payment to bring the Loan current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of 
time, Lender shall either apply such funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such 
funds will be applied to the outstanding principal balance under the Note immediately prior to 
foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower might have now or in the future against Lender shall 
relieve Borrower from making payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument or 
performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.
