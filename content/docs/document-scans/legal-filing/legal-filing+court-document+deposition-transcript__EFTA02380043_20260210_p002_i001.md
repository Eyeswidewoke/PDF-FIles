1. The goals are twofold: avoid paying rent which triggers current sales tax and raises current issues as to the fair 
market rent of such rent; and reduce the risk that the IRS might seek to include the art in the estate under a 2036 
argument. 
2. We recommend that, to achieve this result, the art should continue to be held in the 2011 LLC, the membership 
interests in which are to be sold to a trust where Deborah is a beneficiary. 
3. Proposed action steps to achieve the desired result include: 
a. The 2011 LLC is to create a new LLC (NewCo). The 2011 LLC will contribute its interests in BFP to NewCo. 
b. The 2011 LLC then is to distribute NewCo to the members of the 2011 LLC (the four children's trusts). 
c. The four trusts, in turn, are to sell their interests in 2011 LLC to APO1 in exchange for a promissory note. 
d. The four trusts could contribute the assets they receive from the sale -- the promissory notes from APO1--
to NewCo (if trapping income on the note payments, to avoid mandatory payments to children, is desired). 
e. The 2011 LLC and Debra (a beneficiary of the APO1 Trust) will then enter into an art use agreement, without 
any rent. We should consider who is to pay insurance on such art. 
4. The desired consequences include: 
a. With a sale of membership interests in the 2011 LLC, the sale will involve membership interests in an old 
and cold LLC holding both art, and financial assets, including an interest in Phaidon, securities and investment 
partnerships, strengthening the argument that the sale involves intangible personal property. 
b. By creating NewCo holding BFP, we avoid a sale involving Apollo interests and continue to trap income (that 
would otherwise have to be distributed to the children after age 25 from the children's trusts). 
c. By contributing the note to the 2011 LLC, we better control fiduciary accounting income. 
5. We will need to consider governance issues with respect to the 2011 LLC and NewCo. 
B. Existing Insurance/Split Dollar 
1. The current split dollar arrangements should be terminated in accordance with prior discussions and analysis. 
Ada will circulate a memorandum she prepared for Norman Brownstein, who is the Trustee of the 1999 insurance trusts, 
summarizing the steps. 
2. The insurance on Leon's life ($50 million face amount) likely will be terminated. The survivorship policies ($100 
million) have performed better and may be continued. The family office has been working with Roger Cammon to 
obtain performance illustrations and projections to help make this decision. 
3. If the survivorship policies are retained, the 1999 insurance trust (Trust #2) will continue to own them. Since 
Trust #2 has no other assets, funds could be made available to Trust #2 from APO2 (or another trust) on a periodic basis, 
and without much paperwork, via decantings. 
4. Note that Trust #2 calls for mandatory income payments to the children following the death of the survivor of 
Leon and Debra. It further grants each child a broad testamentary power of appointment (which means that, on his or 
her death, the child may direct the disposition of his or her share of the $100 million death benefit to a spouse or 
anyone else in his or her Will) . We have considered whether it makes sense to decant Trust #2 in favor of a new trust,
