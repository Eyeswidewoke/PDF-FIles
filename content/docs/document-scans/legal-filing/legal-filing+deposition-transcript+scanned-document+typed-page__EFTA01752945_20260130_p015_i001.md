America's =apan paranoia in the early 1990s — just as the Japanese economy was plun=ing off a cliff. Josef Joffe is 
fascinated by these bouts of self-doubt th=t "torment the American imagination." In "Th= Myth of America's Decline,"

As his book title g=ves away, Joffe is more utopian than dystopian. America's overblown worr=es of decline persist, he 
says, mainly because of "linearity": the min=less extrapolation of transient trends — whether in the numbers of Soviet 
ICBMs or the growth of Japanese GDP — f=r into the future. Here Joffe could be channeling Yankee shortstop Derek 
J=ter, who recently complained about fans' fascination with players being =93on pace for" a certain number of home 
runs, no matter how early in the season. "It doesn't work like that,=941=ter said chttp://espn.go.cominew-
york/story/Jid/8399887/gettin=-answers-derek-jeter> to ESPN. "You gotta go do it. 'On pace for' is just useless." = In 
international relations, "on pace for" is pretty useless, to=. The latest linear thinking involves the all-powerful 
Chinese=economy. Joffe dates the paranoia to 2003, when investment bank Goldman Sachs issued its now-famous 
report, "Dreaming With BRICs: The Path to =050 ." The investment firm bui=t on recent trends to declare that by mid-
21st century, China's economy =ould lead the planet, with India in third. The other members of the BRIC c=an (B for 
Brazil, R for Russia) made the challenge seem to be coming from all directions. But these countries =93had nothing in 
common save great size and a catchy acronym," Joffe wri=es, "and by the early 2010s, their fantastic growth rates were 
dropping =ike, well, bricks." Joffe takes the long view; sentences such as "China and Western Europe were about even 
i= per capita income when Christ was born" are not unusual in this book. A=d with China's frenetic growth already 
slowing, Joffe argues that, long =erm, China can't prevail. Its model of state capitalism — he calls it "modernitarianism," 
defined as "mar=ets minus freedom" — leads to corruption, favoritism and inefficiency;=its rising wages don't reflect 
equivalent increases in worker productivi=y; and its population is aging so much that "a burgeoning army of pensioners 
and infirm will eat up investment funds as a=fire will consume oxygen." 
Most important, its=people's rising expectations will eventually leave Chinese leaders with =o good options: They must 
either loosen their grip and enable a democratic=transition that would further slow growth, or they must continue to 
repress and risk a new Tiananmen <http://a=ticles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-02/world/39697799_1_tiananmen-
square-tia=anmen-protests-children> , with the economic crash that would follow. "No matter how the red empero=s 
try to extricate themselves, they will pay the price of waning growth or=worse," Joffe warns. 
But he still has sore convincing to do. A September nationwide survey for the financial site T=eStreet.com finds 
<http://i.thestreet.com/filesitsc/v2008/photos/all-pics/gr=phics/Growth-Infographic-FINALjpg> that America=s rate 
the United States as the world's dominant economy by 59 percent to 28 percent over China. But when they are=asked 
who will be on top in five to seven years, the gap shrinks to 43 to =6 percent. 
Joffe reserves an e=pecially toasty circle of hell for the declinistsg=pan> 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/americas-not-in-de=line--its-on-the-rise/2013/10/18/4dde76be-35b1-

and continually declare America's demise. Indeed, for long stret=hes, the book is less an assessment of U.S. prospects 
and more a trashing =f those who traffic in declinism. They aren't just wrong, Joffe contends, but often maliciously so. 
John F. Kennedy, Ro=ald Reagan and Barack Obama all peddled declinism for electoral ends, he w=ites: "The country is 
on the skids, but tomorrow it will rise again — =f only you, the people, will anoint me as your leader." Doom is also an 
effective career-booster for Washington=wonks; right now, there is no better way to sell a policy initiative to po=iticians 
or the public than to scream that the Chinese are beating us to it <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
