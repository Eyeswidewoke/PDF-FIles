Israeli officials fear they might not have the time to wait and see whether the sanctions halt Iran's nuclear program 
peacefully. 
Israeli military capabilities to strike Iran's proliferating nuclear sites -- especially those bunkered deep within a mountain 
outside the city of Qom -- are more limited than those of the United States. The prospect of a new round of Iranian-U.S. 
diplomacy is another critical component of this equation, as it could further postpone U.S. military action in the event 
that sanctions fail. Taken together, these circumstances could force an Israeli decision on a preemptive strike under 
suboptimal conditions. 
All this puts Israel on the horns of a dilemma. It can hope that sanctions will ultimately deter Iran's nuclear program, but 
this may mean foregoing decisive action against what it sees as an existential threat in the hope that the United States 
will act further down the road. Barak and Netanyahu are commonly identified as favoring a strike, but based on my 
recent trip to the region, it is clear that others within the Israeli cabinet and defense establishment still have doubts. As 
such, the prospect of a strike is not inevitable. If Israel believed that the United States were absolutely committed to 
handling this issue, it would certainly shift the Israeli debate about whether to strike. 
But without absolute certainty, holding off on a strike is a tough decision for Israeli officials to make. Many Israeli 
military leaders are children of Holocaust survivors who joined the Israeli army to ensure Israeli self-reliance in fighting 
against enemies who regularly pledge to eradicate it. A poignant reminder is the iconic photo 
<http://img147.imageshack.us/img147/8028/f15auschwitzltk9.jpg> of Israeli jets flying over Auschwitz in 2003, which 
hangs on the walls of many of their offices. 
Nonetheless, it is a fundamental misreading of Israel to view this as an ideological issue. Israeli considerations of a strike 
are rooted not in their ethos of self-reliance, but in the fear that the United States will ultimately fail to strike, even if 
sanctions fail. Israeli officials' fears are compounded by their knowledge that the American people are fatigued by 
conflict, and by the suspicions of some that the United States has not entirely ruled out a strategy of containment, U.S. 
protestations 
<http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/02/16/32_senators_call_for_no_containment_strategy_for_iran> to 
the contrary. 
The Obama administration's official policy opposes containment, holding that the Iranian nuclear program is too 
destabilizing for the Middle East. As the president told NBC 
chttp://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=256614> on Feb. 5, "We are going to do everything we can 
to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and creating an arms race -- a nuclear arms race -- in a volatile region." 
Concerns about Iran handing dirty bomb technology to non-state actors, such as the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, along 
with fears that Iran would seek to dominate the Persian Gulf, are also all too real. 
In light of these threats, some analysts could argue that Obama -- who is known for his preference for Predator drone 
strikes in Pakistan and such surgical operations as the one that killed Osama bin Laden -- would indeed resort to military 
action if sanctions failed. And despite tensions between Obama and Netanyahu over the Middle East peace process, 
sources close to Obama argued to me that these policy differences in no way infringe upon the president's commitment 
to Israel's security. 
At the same time, U.S. officials have also raised fears of an Israeli strike in the short term -- as evidenced by Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey's comments <http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-21/israeli-
attack-on-iran-would-be-destabilizing-dempsey-says.html> on Feb. 19 that an Israeli attack would be "destabilizing." 
Their fears center on the belief that an attack by Israel could unravel international sanctions, and that Iran would be able 
to reconstitute its program in fairly short order. 
How can Obama and Netanyahu win each other's trust? The two sides should come to a more precise understanding of 
U.S. thresholds for the Iranian nuclear program and American responses should they be breached, as well as an 
agreement on a timetable for giving up on sanctions so their Iran clocks are synchronized. In other words, the two sides
