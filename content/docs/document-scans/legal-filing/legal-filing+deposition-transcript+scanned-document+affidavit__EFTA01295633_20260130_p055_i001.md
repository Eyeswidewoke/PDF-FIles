"evidentiary proof," Comcast, 133 S. Ct. at 1432, and "affirmatively demonstrate [their] 
compliance with the Rule," Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. "[S]ome evidence" is not enough. 
In re Initial Pub. Offerings ["IPO") Sec. Litig., 471 F.3d 24, 33 (2d Cir. 2006). 
Before certifying a class action, courts will require a plaintiff to establish by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the action complies with each part of Rule 23. See In 
re U.S. Foodservice Inc. Pricing Litig., 729 F.3d 108, 117 (2d Cir. 2013); Carrera v. Bayer 
Corp., 727 F.3d 300, 306 (3d Cir. 2013); Messner v. Northshore Univ. HealthSystem, 669 
F.3d 802, 811 (7th Cir. 2012); Ala. Elec. Pension Fund v. Flowserve Corp., 572 F.3d 221, 
228 (5th Cir. 2008), abrogated in other respects by Halliburton, 134 S. Ct. 2398, 189 L. Ed.

Kleen Corp. Bondholders Litig., No. 3:00-1145-17, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31099, 2004 WL 
3115870, at *2 (D.S.C. Nov. 1, 2004); see also Anthony F. Fata, Doomsday Delayed: How 
the Court's Party-Neutral Clarification of Class Certification Standards [*932] in Wal-Mart 
v. Dukes Actually Helps Plaintiffs, 62 DePaul L. Rev. 675, 681 (2013) (reading Wal-Mart to 
apply a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard).

"[T]he factors spelled out in Rule 23 must be addressed through findings, even if they 
overlap with issues on the merits." Gariety, 368 F.3d at 366; accord In re Rail Freight Fuel 
Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 725 F.3d 244, 249, 406 U.S. App. D.C. 371 (D.C. Cir. 2013) 
(recognizing that certification will sometimes "resemble[] an appraisal on the merits"). 
Obviously, "[a] court may not say something like 'let's resolve the merits first and worry 
about the class later . . . or 'I'm not going to certify a class unless I think that the plaintiffs 
will prevail."' Szabo v. Bridgeport Machs., Inc., 249 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 2001), cited 
with approval in Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552. But overlap "cannot be helped," as 
certification "generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal 
issues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action." Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551-52. 
Compare Brown I, 576 F.3d at 156 (citing Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177, 
94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1974), and refusing to inquire into Plaintiffs' statistics 
because it would be an impermissibly "in-depth assessment of the merits"), with Wal-Mart, 
131 S. Ct. at 2552 & n.6 (admonishing courts not to "mistakenly cite[]" Eisen for the 
incorrect idea that merits inquiries are barred). 
3. 
Contrast these well-defined and rigorous [**92] standards with the ambiguous and 
limitless ones found in the majority opinion. The majority acknowledges the "rigorous 
analysis" that lower courts must perform, but abandons that standard soon after 
mentioning it. Instead, it treats the evidentiary standard for certification as one different 
from that required for a party to prevail on the merits, never acknowledging that this view 
breaks from the many courts (including those in our Circuit) that apply the preponderance 
standard. Nor does it even tell us what a "rigorous analysis" might consist of. Instead, it 
merely invokes Amgen, a case that addresses what questions may be considered on class 
certification, not what evidence will suffice to answer them. 133 S. Ct. at 1194-95. Having 
rendered the rigorous analysis less rigorous than other courts' (though to what degree, one
