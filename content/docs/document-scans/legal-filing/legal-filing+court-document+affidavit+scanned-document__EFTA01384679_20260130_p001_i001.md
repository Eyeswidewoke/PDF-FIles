HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Partnership in connection with the recognition or unrecognition of contingent tax liabilities may 
have a material positive or negative effect on certain Partners and prospective investors, depending 
on the circumstances. 
Changes in Regulatory Positions 
In addition to proposed and actual accounting changes, there have recently been certain 
well-publicized incidents of regulators unexpectedly taking positions which prohibited strategies 
which had been implemented in a variety of formats for many years. In the current unsettled 
regulatory environment, it is impossible to predict if future regulatory developments might 
adversely affect the Partnership. 
The foregoing list of risk factors does not purport to be a complete enumeration or 
explanation of the risks involved in an investment in the Partnership. Prospective investors 
should read this entire Memorandum and consult with their own advisers before deciding 
whether to invest in the Partnership. No assurance can be made that profits will be achieved 
or that substantial losses will not be incurred. 
MANAGEMENT FEE; EXPENSES 
The Partnership will pay a fixed management fee (the "Management Fee"), payable 
quarterly (prorated for partial quarters) in advance, to the Management Company. 
The 
Management Fee equals 0.50% (2.0% annualized) of the beginning value of the Capital Account 
of a Limited Partner (before the accrual of any Incentive Allocation). The Management Company 
may, without the consent of Limited Partners, cause the Management Fee to be charged to and 
paid by the Master Fund and the HB Fund (pLo rata based on their relative net asset values), instead 
of the Partnership. 
A pro_ rata portion of the Management Fee will be paid out of any capital contributions 
made by new or existing Limited Partners to the Partnership as of any date that does not fall on 
the first business day of a calendar quarter, based on the actual number of days remaining in such 
partial calendar quarter. In the case of a withdrawal by a Limited Partner other than as of the last 
business day of a calendar quarter a pro rata portion of the Management Fee (based on the actual 
number of days remaining in such partial quarter) will be repaid by the Management Company to 
the Partnership and distributed to the withdrawing Limited Partner. The Management Fee will be 
amortized in equal installments as of the last day of each month during the applicable calendar 
quarter. 
The Management Company may reduce, waive or calculate differently (and has done so 
on occasion) the Management Fee with respect to certain Limited Partners, including, without 
limitation, Limited Partners that are affiliates, consultants or current or former Principals or 
employees of the General Partner or the Management Company, members of the immediate 
families of such persons and trusts or other entities for their benefit. 
In consideration for the Management Fee, the Management Company renders certain 
administrative and managerial services to the Partnership and bears certain administrative 
expenses of the Partnership. The Management Company provides to the Partnership computer
