2006 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 1044, * 
On February 10, 2005, Dr. Goss prescribed four additional weeks of physical therapy, 
and stated that, "I have placed the claimant back to full duty as of March 14, 2005," after 
the completion of therapy. The doctor indicated that: "The claimant will return to full duty 
and we will see how things go." 
Dr. LaMarche r51 evaluated the claimant on February 15, 2005, and noted that: "I 
wrote him a note to release him to work for 3/14/2005, as Dr. Goss did. The claimant says 
he will try it for a day, but he knows that it will not work for him." Dr. LaMarche commented 
that he found no clear etiology for the claimant's discomfort, but that he had no reason to 
doubt his sincerity. 
The claimant saw Dr. Goss on March 15, 2005, and reported a multitude of ongoing 
orthopedic complaints. The doctor reported that he was released to full duty, but that the 
employer no longer had a job for him. Dr. Goss proposed another FCE, and stated that: "I 
will still keep the claimant at full duty but the FCE will help guide future decisions." 
The claimant underwent another FCE on April 14, 2005, and Dr. Goss reviewed the 
results on April 19, 2005. The doctor noted that: "As expected the claimant's FCE shows a 
lack of ability to perform full duty." The FCE reported that he showed significant symptom 
exaggeration and not a full effort. Dr. Goss agreed to keep the claimant at "sedentary duty 
per his FCE," and predicted that he would progress his work-related capabilities after four 
more weeks of physical therapy. 
On May 17, ['6] 2005, Dr. Goss concluded that he had nothing further to offer the 
claimant and referred him to a pain management specialist. The doctor recommended 
continued sedentary duty, and considered this restriction to be permanent until he saw a 
pain management physician and perhaps had another FCE. Dr. Goss commented that he 
'Would not mind a full duty release at this point," based on the claimant's lack of full effort 
at the FCE. Regardless, the doctor left the decision to the pain management specialist. Dr. 
Goss issued a disability slip indicating that the sedentary-duty restrictions were temporary 
until the claimant reached maximum medical improvement on June 1, 2005. 
Pursuant to Dr. Goss' referral, Dr. Donald Holzer, neurologist, evaluated the claimant 
on June 18, 2005. Dr. Holzer concluded that he suffered cervical myofascial pain 
dysfunction syndrome with underlying disc herniations, cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, 
lumbar myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome with underlying lumbar spondylosis, post-
traumatic syndrome secondary to his head trauma, and depression over his chronic pain 
and inability to function. The doctor stated that these problems were directly and causally 
related rij to the claimant's industrial accident. Dr. Holzer proposed a TENS unit, 
consultation with a pain psychologist, cervical epidural steroid injections, and medications. 
The doctor recommended that: "The claimant cease working entirely at the present time, 
as he clearly is having extreme difficulties functioning, even in a part-time capacity and this 
will allow us an opportunity to assess fully the therapies proposed above." 
On July 5, 2005, the claimant returned to Dr. Goss, who repeated that he had no 
treatment to offer, and that he had deferred treatment and work restrictions to the 
physiatrist. The doctor expressed doubt that the symptoms were as severe as he 
conveyed during his clinic visits. Dr. Holzer monitored the claimant's ongoing symptoms 
throughout the summer of 2005.
