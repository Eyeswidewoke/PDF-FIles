join them and cal=ing themselves The Free Syrian Army — the uprising becomes a civil war =E244 with extremist from 
across the region and around the world traveling to Syria to join The Rebels. 
Assad actually encourages this by releasing jihadists' prisoners to taint the rebellion with extremism, with the hope of 
making it harder for foreign backers to support them. In January 2012 Al Qaeda forms = new branch in Syria calling 
themselves — Jabhat al-Nusra. AIs= around that time, Syrian Kurdish groups take up arms and informally secede from 
Assad's rule in the North. 4)=A0 
=br> 
And that sum=er is when Syria became a proxy war with Iran interceding on Assad's behalf, sending daily cargo flights 
and hund=eds of ground officers. This causes several oil-rich Arab states in the region to start sending money and 
weapons to Th= Rebels, to counter Iran's influence. Please click on the web link above to see why Syria is such a mess 
with no easy answers. 
What troubles me is how cavalier both Congressional Republicans and Democrats with their accolades, including Senator 
Lindsey Graham comparing Trump to the most beloved Republican President in the mode=n era, the one and only 
Ronald Reagan. As pundits used the phrases of 4>=9Cstrong message" and "new sheriff in town=E24,40 few asked what 
actually was accomplished. Think about it, the US military did not target President Assad's Sarin gas stoc=pile. And since 
President Trump warned the Russians an hour in advanced that he was attacking Shayrat air field, one then has t= 
believe that they alerted their ally President Assad. Finally, most p=oportionate military responses are really only made 
to make the aggressors feel better when they don't have a strategy. 
Talal al-Barazi, the governor of Homs province that includ=s the air base, said at least 13 people were killed in the missile 
strikes, including five soldiers on the base and eight civilians in areas surroundin= the facility. The figures could not be 
independently confirmed, but are said to include several children, which if true will provide another photo opt for both 
the Syrian Regime, as well as terrorist around the world showing the innocent civilians killed by America= aggression. 
Q=A0 
Although the Pentagon's initial assessment was that the strike severely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and 
support infrastructure an= equipment at the airfield. But within hours of the missile attack, Syrian warplanes had taken 
off from that same =irfield and launched airstrikes against Khan Sheikhoun, the same town where at leas= 86 people had 
been killed in the sarin attack and dropped new conventional bom=s. As Comedian/Satirist John Oliver pointed out 
during his show on HBO this week, "while it is natural to take some=kind of action in response, it has to come in the 
context in a larger strategy or i= is close to worthless. And though the strikes seem to make certain people feel better... 
What did the= actually achieve?"
