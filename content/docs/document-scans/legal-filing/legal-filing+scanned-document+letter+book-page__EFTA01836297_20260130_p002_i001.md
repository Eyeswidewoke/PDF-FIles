Barry and Fran Weissler. 
As the roadshows of "Chicago" — a musical that glamorizes, if not celebrates, getting away with murder —
rolled out around the globe, the Weisslers made a fortune. We never knew what hit us; Mrs. Weissler said. 
*We had been successful before, but 'Chicago' changed our lives." 
There are many ways to measure success. On a trivial level, Mrs. Weissler, 82, recalled, it meant "I could 
actually get my hair done twice a week, instead of once a week." And there was the apartment in Manhattan 
overlooking Central Park and an estate in Waccabuc, in Westchester County, that the couple bought 11 years 
ago. 
But Mr. Weissler, 71, had yet another dream, one that would bring a dash of elitist razzle-dazzle to the staid 
Westchester community. 
1 though it would be great to have a private outdoor theater," the trim, bearded producer explained. 'When I 
first saw the house in Waccabuc with its long run of meadow, I knew I had to do it." 
It took the Weisslers another 10 years, but today the estate includes a "land sculpture" by the artist Beverly 
Pepper, a work that serves as the amphitheater Mr. Weissler desired. 
Beyond the home's formal French gardens are two massive, curved hand-carved panels, set into a grassy 
hillside like the excavated wall of an ancient cave. Reaching 16 feet at their peak in the center, they create a 
backdrop for performers when the space is used as a theater. The panels, made of granite powder, a binder 
and concrete, simulate enormous granite stones. 
Their slant 'was the sculptural element that made the work as dramatic as possible," said Ms. Pepper. 87. who 
visits Waccabuc periodically to check on her project. "The curve fits into that lush background as a counterpoint 
to the formality of the garden." 
The steps or seats are rows of concrete, with lighting supplied by six soaring steel pyramidal columns that flank 
them. Additional lights, tiny ones, are tucked into the ground. 
In June 2009, the Weisslers inaugurated the theater with an evening for patrons of the New York Philharmonic, 
with music by the orchestra's principal brass. That October, with Marvin Hamlisch and others performing, the 
couple held another event, a fund-raiser for the conservatory of music at SUNY College at Purchase. Nearly 
200 guests sat on the steps and the remaining audience members used blankets on the lawn. 
*We were exhilarated," said Mrs. Weissler. "I could not believe it was so successful and it was in our own 
backyard." 
But if the Weisslers think of Ms. Pepper's work primarily as an amphitheater, Ms. Pepper does not. 
'The site pieces are not designed to be literally theaters," she said recently over coffee at the Weisslers' house, 
gazing across the formal gardens to her work. 
"As I told Barry and Fran at great length, this is a sculpture that can be used as a theater, but at least 10 
months a year it is a sculpture," the said. If it were designed more as a theater than as a sculpture, "it would 
have changed the dynamics," she explained. 'The seating would have been more individual, and it would not 
have been so narrow at the top."
