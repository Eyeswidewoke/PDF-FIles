certain fraudulent transactions conducted using chip-enabled cards. This will shift an increased amount of the risk for certain 
fraudulent transactions from the issuing banks to these sellers, which may result in our having to seek an increased level of 
reimbursement for chargebacks from our sellers that do not deploy EMV compliant card readers. Our financial results would be 
adversely affected to the extent these sellers do not fully reimburse us for the related chargebacks. We do not collect and maintain 
reserves from our sellers to cover these potential losses, and for customer relations purposes we sometimes decline to seek 
reimbursement for certain chargebacks. The risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those of our sellers that promise future 
delivery of goods and services, which we allow on our service. If we are unable to maintain our losses from chargebacks at 
acceptable levels, the payment card networks could fine us. increase our transaction fees, or terminate our ability to process 
payment cards. Any increase in our transaction fees could damage our business, and if we were unable to accept payment cards. 
our business would be materially and adversely affected. 
We derive substantially all of our revenue from payments services. Our efforts to expand our product portfolio and market 
reach may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth. 
We derive substantially all of our revenue from transaction fees we collect in connection with payments services. While we 
intend to continue to broaden the scope of products and services we offer, we may not be successful in deriving any significant 
revenue from these products and services. Failure to broaden the scope of products and services that are attractive may inhibit the 
growth of repeat business and harm our business, as well as increase the vulnerability of our core payments business to 
competitors offering a full suite of products and services. Furthermore, we may have limited or no experience in our newer markets. 
For example, we cannot assure you that any financial services and marketing services will be widely used. These offerings may 
present new and difficult technology, operational, and other challenges, and if we experience service disruptions, failures, or other 
issues, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Our newer activities may not recoup our investments in a timely 
manner or at all. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and materially and adversely affect 
our business. 
Our success depends on our ability to develop products and services to address the rapidly evolving market for 
payments and POS, financial, and marketing services, and, if we are not able to implement successful enhancements and 
new features for our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected. 
We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and 
evolve. Rapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments 
in ecommerce, mobile commerce, and proximity payment devices (including contactless payments via NFC technology). Other 
potential changes are on the horizon as well, such as developments in crypto-currencies and in tokenization, which replaces 
sensitive data (e.g., payment card information) with symbols (tokens) to keep the data safe in the event that it ends up in the 
wrong hands. Similarly, there is rapid innovation in the provision of other products and services to businesses, including in financial 
services and marketing services.

These new services and technologies may be superior to. impair, or render obsolete the products and services we currently 
offer or the technologies we currently use to provide them. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may 
require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and we may not be successful in realizing a return on these 
development efforts in a timely manner or at all. There can be no assurance that any new products or services we develop and 
offer to our sellers will achieve significant commercial acceptance. For example, in 2011, we introduced Square Wallet, a mobile 
payment app, and discontinued it in May 2014. Our ability to develop new products and services may be inhibited by industry-wide 
standards, payment card networks, laws and regulations, resistance to change from buyers or sellers, or third parties' intellectual 
property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and to adapt to technological changes and 
evolving industry standards. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our products and services or to 
develop new products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and 
evolving industry standards, our business would be materially and adversely affected. 
The success of enhancements, new features, and products and services depends on several factors, including the timely 
completion, introduction, and market acceptance of the enhancements or new features or services. We often rely not only on our 
own initiatives and innovations, but also on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to 
new technologies. For example, we have recently introduced a chip and contactless reader combining EMV and NFC technologies, 
but we do not yet know whether this reader will be supported by other important industry participants or gain wide market 
acceptance. Failure to accurately predict or to respond effectively to developments in our industry may significantly impair our
