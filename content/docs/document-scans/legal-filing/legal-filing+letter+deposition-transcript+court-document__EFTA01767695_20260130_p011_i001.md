Are Israeli Agents Assassinating Iranian Scientists? A New Book Argues 
Dan Raviv <http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/dan-raviv.html> , Yossi Melman 
July 7, 2012 -- Another wave of hangings by Iran's Islamic government is expected, after officials announced that 
twenty Iranians were arrested, allegedly for helping Israel assassinate Iranian nuclear scientists 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/13/has-israel-been-killing-iran-s-nuclear-scientists.html> . Executions 
are just a matter of time, as Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) is out to show that it is not completely 
helpless in the face of four assassinations and one failed attempt in the streets of the capital, Tehran, over the last two 
years. Israeli officials refuse to comment on who specifically might be guilty or innocent, but they publicly expressed 
their joy that "God's finger" had acted against Iran's nuclear program. They also indicate that no credence should be 
placed in the "confessions" that will doubtless be televised by Iran. Before Majid Jamali Fashi was hanged two months 
ago, as the convicted "murderer" of a nuclear scientist in January 2010, the 24-year-old kick boxer was shown on official 
TV reciting a tale of having been flown to Israel for training by the Mossad. His interrogators, who probably wrote the 
confession for him, had seen far too many B-movies about spies and were wrong on many details, including the location 
of Mossad headquarters. 
Our in-depth study of fifty years of assassinations by Israel's foreign espionage agency—including conversations 
with current and former Mossad operatives and those who work with them in countries friendly to Israel—yields the 
conclusion that Fashi and the twenty other suspects now being held were not the killers. The methods, communications, 
transportation, and even the innovative bombs used in the Tehran killings are too sensitive for the Mossad to share with 
foreign freelancers. Instead, the assassinations are likely the work of Israel's special spy unit for the most delicate 
missions: a kind of Mossad within the Mossad called Kidon (Bayonet). Kidon operatives are even more innovative, 
braver, and physically fitter than other Mossad men and women. Again and again, they have fulfilled their missions 
without leaving much of a trace. The Israeli government has never confirmed Kidon's existence or its actions. 
The assassinations of physicists and nuclear scientists in Iran have been what Israelis call "blue and white" 
operations, referring to the colors of their nation's flag. Without giving full details, senior Israeli officials have revealed 
that fact to counterparts in the CIA and the White House. In at least one instance, U.S. officials were obviously 
displeased that the Mossad took action at a delicate juncture in multilateral nuclear talks with Iran. 
Although Iran has no diplomatic relations with Israel and bans any visits by Israelis, Mossad operatives seem to 
have no trouble entering and leaving the country. Despite being a heavily patrolled police state, Iran has long borders 
that stretch across mountains and wasteland. Two of the neighboring former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan and 
Turkmenistan, provide an excellent launching pad for cross-border penetrations. Also, for over half a century now, the 
Mossad has cultivated close cooperation with Kurds— who were stateless, but now run the Kurdish autonomous zone of 
northern Iraq which borders Iran. Israel used to secretly help Kurds when they were oppressed by Iraq's government, 
and the Mossad has excelled in living by the ancient dictum that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. 
Israeli intelligence has also expressed an interest in collaborating with disaffected minority groups inside Iran. 
Meir Dagan—the director of the Mossad from 2002 through 2010—was quoted in a State Department cable obtained 
and released by Wikileaks. He is said to have told a senior American official in 2007 that disaffection among Baluchi,
