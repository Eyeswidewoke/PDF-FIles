purchased with the proceeds of a sale of a Collateral Obligation that was not a Discount Obligation at the time of 
purchase will not be considered a Discount Obligation if such Collateral Obligation (a) together with all such 
Collateral Obligations excluded from the definition of Discount Obligations on or prior to the date of determination 
have a cumulative Aggregate Principal Balance of no more than $20 million, (b) has been purchased or committed 
to be purchased within five Business Days of such sale. (c) has been purchased at a purchase price of at least 65% 
and that was equal to or greater than the sale price of the sold Collateral Obligation. and (d) its rating (if any) from 
each Rating Agency is equal to or greater than such rating of the sold Collateral Obligation. For purposes of this 
definition. a Collateral Obligation. portions of which were purchased at different times and at different prices, will 
be treated as separate Collateral Obligations (i.e. such portions will not be treated as a single Collateral Obligation 
with a weighted average purchase price). 
"Dissolution Expenses": An amount certified by the Investment Manager as the sum of (i) the expenses reasonably 
likely to be incurred in connection with the discharge of the Indenture and the liquidation of the Collateral and 
dissolution of the Issuers and (ii) any accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses. 
"Distressed Exchange Offer': An offer by the issuer of a Collateral Obligation to exchange one or more of its 
outstanding debt obligations for a different debt obligation or to repurchase one or more of its outstanding debt 
obligations for cash, or any combination thereof: provided that an offer by such issuer to exchange unregistered debt 
obligations for registered debt obligations shall not be considered a Distressed Exchange Offer. 
"Diversity Test": A test satisfied as of any Measurement Date if the Diversity Score equals or exceeds the 
applicable number in the columns entitled "Diversity Score" in the Collateral Matrix based on the row/column 
combination selected by the Investment Manager with notice to the Collateral Administrator (or linear interpolation 
between two rows and/or two columns, as applicable) specified for the applicable case under the Collateral Matrix. 
For purposes of this definition, the "Diversity Score" is a single number that indicates collateral concentration in 
terms of industry and obligor concentration. It is similar to a score that Moody's uses to measure default risk for 
purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of obligor and industry 
concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Obligations is calculated as set forth in the Indenture. 
considering any obligors affiliated with one another as a single obligor. unless they are in different industries. 
Structured Finance Obligations that are collateralized loan obligations will not be included for purposes of the 
calculation of the Diversity Score or related calculations.

Redemption Date, Stated Maturity of the Notes or last Liquidation Distribution Date), the period ending on (and 
excluding) the related Determination Date (or. in the case of a Rated Notes Redemption Date. Equity Redemption 
Date. Stated Maturity of the Notes or last Liquidation Distribution Date. the Business Day preceding such 
Redemption Date, Stated Maturity or last Liquidation Distribution Date, as the case may be) and beginning on (and

applicable Indenture requirements have been satisfied.

accountants' letter confirming that each Collateral Quality Test (other than the S&P CDO Monitor Test), each 
applicable Coverage Test and each Concentration Limit was satisfied and that the Issuer had purchased (or entered 
into commitments to purchase) Collateral Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance that, together with up to
