Dozens of leading U=S. companies have set up technology incubators in Israel to take advantage=of the country's 
penchant for new ideas, which is why Bill Gates observe= in 2006 that the "innovation going on in Israel is critical to the 
future of the technology business." Likewis=, Israeli high-tech firms often turn to U.S. companies as partners for joi=t 
production and marketing opportunities in the United States and elsewher=, creating tens of thousands of American 
jobs. And although Israelis make up just three percent of the population o= the Middle East, in 2011 Israel was the 
destination of 25 percent of all =S. exports to the region, having recently eclipsed Saudi Arabia as the to= market there 
for American products. 
U.S. companies' s=bstantial cooperation with Israel on information technology has been cruci=l to Silicon Valley's 
success. At Intel's research and development cen=ers in Israel, engineers have designed many of the company's most 
successful microprocessors, accounting for some 40=percent of the firm's revenues last year. If you've made a secure 
fina=cial transaction on the Internet, sent an instant message, or bought somet=ing using PayPal, you can thank Israeli IT 
researchers. 
Israeli innovators =ave also come up with novel solutions to the water and food security chall=nges posed by population 
growth, climate change, and economic development.=By necessity, given the geography of the Middle East, Israel is a 
world leader in water conservation and manage=ent and high-tech agriculture. Israel recycles more than eighty percent 
of=its wastewater -- the highest level in the world -- and has pioneered wide=y used techniques of conserving or 
purifying water, including drip irrigation and reverse osmosis desalina=ion. And a number of Israeli companies are 
leaders in the development of r=newable energy sources; BrightSource Industries, for example, is building = solar power 
plant in California using Israeli technology that will double the amount of solar thermal elec=ricity produced in America. 
These innovations, bolstered by the substantia= American investment in Israel, contribute to long-term U.S. domestic 
and =oreign policy objectives relating to sustainable development. 
To be sure, the all=ance with Israel has not been without risks or costs for Washington. The 1=73 War between Israel 
and its neighbors brought America to the brink of co=flict with the Soviet Union and prompted an Arab embargo on oil 
exports to the United States. Following the 1982 Is=aeli invasion of Lebanon, the Reagan administration dispatched U.S. 
marine= to help stabilize the country, which ultimately resulted in costly attack= on American diplomats and military 
personnel there. And U.S. diplomatic and military support for Israel has r=inforced negative attitudes toward the United 
States in many Arab and pred=minantly Muslim countries. 
But these costs sho=ld not be overstated. Beyond leading to largely symbolic UN votes against =S. positions, 
Washington's support for Israel has hardly damaged the Un=ted States' ties with its Arab and Muslim allies. Standing 
with Israel certainly has not hobbled U.S. policy toward =he region as much as the war in Iraq or Washington's backing of 
autocrat=c Arab regimes. Meanwhile, no Arab ally of the United States has ever, as = result of its pro-Israel posture, 
refused to cooperate with Washington on counterterrorism or denied its req=ests for access, basing, or overflight rights. 
In fact, the U.S.-I=raeli alliance has at times helped spur closer U.S.-Arab relations, on the=theory that only the United 
States could convince Israel to make concessio=s in negotiations; this was part of the logic behind Egypt's shift away 
from the Soviet Union and toward the=United States in the 1970s. And even during the past decade of close U.S.-=sraeli 
cooperation, and despite an impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peac= process, Arab ties with the United States have 
largely flourished: bilateral trade and investment are booming= as U.S. exports to the Middle East in 2011 reached an 
all-time high of $5= billion. Defense cooperation is as close as ever, indicated by the severa= multi-billion-dollar arms 
deals that Washington has struck with Gulf allies in recent years. Moreover, sev=ral states, including Egypt and Jordan, 
along with the Palestinian Authori=y, share intelligence with Israel and at various times have worked behind =he scenes 
to enlist Israel as an intermediary with Washington. This has been the case even with Egypt's p=st-revolutionary 
government. All this underscores the fact that self-inter=st, not ideology, is the primary driver of the Arab states' 
relations wi=h Washington. 
Despite the ties th=t continue to bind the United States and some Arab countries, the last two=years of upheaval have 
brought turmoil to many of Washington's tradition=l allies in the region. At a time of great uncertainty, particularly as
