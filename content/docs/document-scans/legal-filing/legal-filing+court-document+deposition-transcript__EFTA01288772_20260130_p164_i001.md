• Noncovered under the cost basis rules as defined below. 
Securities acquired before 2011 or in retirement accounts are generafty not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ('IRC")(incorporating 
amendments enacted by P. L.110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are, therefore, considered Iioncovered," under the new cost basis repotting rules, and marked or denoted as such. 
All other securities in this section are securities which are 'covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are "covered under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as 
non tetirernent US taxpayers securities which have been acquired on or after their "applicable date(st at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis will be reported to the IRS 
CO form 1099-8 for the applicable tax year in which the security is disposed. 
Reporting requirements generally will be phased in over a three-year pencid, as follows: 
• 
Stock in a corporation acquired on or after January 1, 2011 
• 
Mutual funds and dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012 
• 
Options and any Debt Instruments that provide a simple Aced payment schedule for which a yield to maturity can be easily determined acquired on or after January 1, 2014. 
This Schedule may not reflect all cost basis adjustments necessary for tax reporting purposes, especially for noncovered securities. Adjustments to cost basis may have been made for prior income received and 
subsequently reclassified by the issuer as a return of capital. In addition, corporate action events may require adjustments to your original cost basis. Return of capital information and cost basis information, as 
it relates to corporate actions, has been obtained from sources we beleve to be reliable. 
Adjustments to cost basis can be made after year-end, in particular, for retum of capital adjustments, but may also include adjustments for corporate action events. Therefore there may be differences in cost 
basis reflected on your monthly client brokerage statement at year end versus any subsequent reports, including your 1099.8 or online displays you may have available to you. 
When you report your cost basis on your tax return, it should be verified using all of your own records. In particular, there may be other adjustments which you need to make, but are not required to be made by 
Pershing as it relates to H.R. 1424. You should consul with your tax advisor in order to properly report your gain or loss for tax purposes. Pershing shall not be responsible for and makes no representations or 
warranties with respect to the accuracy of any information that you report to the IRS or other taxing authorities, and, accordingly, disclaims any and all liability that may arise with respect to your use and rekance 
on the information provided herein for such reporting. 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities may be adjusted for amortization, accretion, original issue discount adjustments, or principal paydowns. The calculation is based upon the taxpayer election, type of fixed 
income security, and certain attributes, obtained from sources believed to be rekable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there may be a temporary incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected 
unti the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those involving foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with 
less than one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consul your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns. 
13 The cost basis of this security has been provided to us by the delivering firm or transferring agent and Pershing makes no representation as to the accuracy of this information. 
Please refer to the Your Account Information Section in your brokerage account statement for your accounts existing tax-lot disposition method. The disposition method is the method which you have selected to 
use in the disposal of each tax lot of the securities held in your account. If you do not select a method, your account will be defauted to First In, First Out (FIFO). Your account's selected tax lot method wil be 
used to determine the cost basis for calculating gain and/or loss. unless another method was selected at the time of the security disposal, and this may be reported on the IRS Form 1099-8,
