Enzyme Trio For Biosynthesis Of Hydrocarbon Fuels Space Daily June 25, 2010 Friday 
The enzymes produced by this trio of genes enabled the E. coli to synthesize from glucose 
long-chain alkene hydrocarbons. These long-chain alkenes can then be reduced in size - a 
process called "cracking" - to obtain shorter hydrocarbons that are compatible with today's 
engines and favored for the production of advanced lignocellulosic biofuels. 
"In order to engineer microorganisms to make biofuels efficiently, we need to know the 
applicable gene sequences and specific metabolic steps involved in the biosynthesis 
pathway," Beller says. 'We have now identified three genes encoding enzymes that are 
essential for the bacterial synthesis of alkenes. With this information we were able to 
convert an E. coli strain that normally cannot make long-chain alkenes into an alkene 
producer." 
Working with Beller on this study were Ee-Been Goh and Jay Keasling. The three were the 
co-authors of a paper that appeared earlier this year in the journal Applied and 
Environmental Microbiology, titled "Genes Involved in Long-Chain Alkene Biosynthesis in 
Micrococcus luteus." 
It has long been known that certain types of bacteria are able to synthesize aliphatic 
hydrocarbons, which makes them promising sources of the enzymes needed to convert 
lignocellulose into advanced biofuels. However, until recently, little was known about the 
bacterial biosynthesis of non-isoprenoid hydrocarbons beyond a hypothesis that fatty acids 
are precursors. 
JBEI researchers in the Fuels Synthesis Division, which is headed by co-author Keasling, 
are using the tools of synthetic biology, and mathematical models of metabolism and gene 
regulation to engineer new microbes that can quickly and efficiently produce advanced 
biofuel molecules. E.coli is one of the model organisms being used in this effort because it 
is a well-studied microbe that is exceptionally amenable to genetic manipulation. 
"We chose to work with M. luteus because a close bacterial relative was well-documented 
to synthesize alkenes and because a draft genome sequence of M. luteus was available," 
Beller says. "The first thing we did was to confirm that M. luteus also produces alkenes." 
Beller and his colleagues worked from a hypothesis that known enzymes capable of 
catalyzing both decarboxylation and condensation should be good models for the kind of 
enzymes that might catalyze alkene synthesis from fatty acids. 
Using condensing enzymes as models, the scientists identified several candidate genes in 
M. luteus, including Mlut_13230. When expressed in E. coli together with the two adjacent 
genes - Mlut_13240 and 13250 - this trio of enzymes catalyzed the synthesis of alkenes 
from glucose. Observations were made both in vivo and in vitro. 
'This group of enzymes can be used to make aliphatic hydrocarbons in an appropriate 
microbial host but the resulting alkenes are too long to be used directly as liquid fuels," 
Beller says. "However, these long-chain alkenes can be cracked - a technique routinely 
used in oil refineries - to create hydrocarbons of an appropriate length for diesel fuel." 
The next step Beller says is to learn more about how these three enzymes work, 
particularly Mlut_13230 (also called OleA), which catalyzes the key step in the alkene 
biosynthesis pathway - the condensation of fatty acids.
