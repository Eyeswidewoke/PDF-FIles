It is far from unusual for the requesting authority to provide further information, sometimes at the request of the 
court itself. In this case it was surprising that the information was not supplied earlier. By section 202(1) a part 
1 warrant may be received in evidence in proceedings under the Extradition Act 2003. Section 202(2) provides 
that any other document issued in a category 1 territory may be received in evidence in proceedings under the 
Act if it is duly authenticated. It is not disputed that Ms Ny's statement is duly authenticated. 
Miss Montgomery has argued that Parliament's intention was that any further information submitted by a 
requesting Judicial Authority should be received by the court as admissible evidence if duly authenticated. She 
asked me to compare the provisions relating to Part 1 cases with section 84 of the Extradition Act 2003 which 
allows the judge to treat documentary statements which would be admissible if given in oral evidence admissible 
evidence of fact if the statement has been made to a police officer or investigator. 
As Miss Montgomery points out, section 84 of the Act governs part 2 warrants, and it cannot be the case that it 
is easier to admit material for pan 2 warrants under section 84 than for a part I warrant. I am satisfied that the 
information is receivable under section 202 and admissible. It is admissible under the Extradition Act, as 
potentially is all information. I bear in mind that it is hearsay. I bear in mind that the defence has not had the 
opportunity to cross-examine the witness. All these are matters that go to weight. 
The validity of the warrant 
The defence says that the warrant does not comply with section 2 of the Extradition Act 2003. Unless I am sure 
the warrant is valid I must discharge. 
The attack is threefold. Firstly Ms Ny is not eligible to issue the EAW. Secondly she is not "a judicial 
authority". Thirdly the warrant is not "issued ... for the purpose of being prosecuted for the offence" as 
required by subsections 2 and 3. The argument is set out in the skeleton argument prepared by counsel for the 
defendant on 4th February 2011, and is further developed in the skeleton dated 7th February 2011. 
Ms Ny does not have authority to issue the warrant and is not "a judicial authority". 
The main points made about Ms Ny's lack of authority to issue the EAW arc: 
• 
Ms Ny is not "the Director of Public Prosecutions" as referred to by the prosecution. 
• 
Whether she has authority to issue the warrant is a fundamental question going to the heart of 
the court's jurisdiction in this case. 
• 
There is lack of clarity as to who is the judicial authority in this case. 
The authority to issue an EAW is indeed a fundamental question. That question has already been determined by 
the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The certificate issued by SOCA on 6th December 2010 says "On behalf of
