Pilots and flight engineers are high on the list — surprisingly so. Althou=h we all know airplanes crash on occasion, it's 
not like there are huge=disasters on a daily basis. Evidently, though, many pilots and engineers are killed w=ile on the 
job. The fatal work injury rate among this group of people is 40.4 per 100,000, good enough for a spot amon= the top 
three deadliest .

=his one should come as no surprise. There are even TV shows — most notably, Deadliest Catch — that chronicle just 
how dangerous and deadly the lives of fishermen can be. And it's no jok=. Folks working in this notoriously tough 
industry do die on the job at an alarming=C24,rate. The fatal work injury rate =or those working in fishing and related 
industries is 54.8 per 100,000.

Stars of another reality series, Ax Men, work in the nation's deadliest occupation: logging. Loggers are killed on the j=b 
more often than any other worker. Falling trees, heavy machinery, exposure to the elements — there's =o lack of

Before OSHA was created 43 years ago, an estimated 14,000 workers were killed on t=e job every year. Although today, 
workplaces are much safer and healthier sti=l thousands of U.S. workers die from injuries on the job. In fact, the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics' National Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries shows a prel=minary total of 4,383 fatal work injuries 
in 2012, down slightly from the final co=nt of 4,693 in 2011. 
Forty-one percent of all fatal workplace injuries happened in transportation incident=, which include car accidents, 
overturned vehicles and plane crashes. More th=n half (58%) of the 1,789 fatal transportation-related incidents occurred 
on highways, and involved motorized land vehicles. 
The second-highest cause of worker fatali=ies was assaults and violent acts, which accounted for 18% of deaths. The 
preliminary data shows that workplace suicides fell slightly in 2010 to 258 after climbing to a high of 263 the year before. 
Violence took the lives of 767 workers last year; with 463 homicides and 225 suicide=. (Work-related suicides declined 
by 10% from 2011 totals, but violence accou=ted for about 17% of all fatal work injuries in 2012.) Shootings were the 
most frequent manner of death in both. 
Slips, falls and trips killed 668 workers in 2012 -- about 15% of all workplace injuries. A total of 509 workers were fatally 
injured after being struck by equipment or objects on the job. 
There were 142 multiple-fatality incidents -- incidents where more than one worke= was killed--in 2012, in which 341 
workers died. 
Ninety-two percent, or 4,045 of all on-the-job fatalities were among men, and the remaining 8%, or 338, were women. 
This is partly because there are disproportionately more men in dangerous indust=ies like construction and mining. Still, 
women face their own dangers. Ab=ut 20% of the women who died on the job were involved in roadway incidents,
