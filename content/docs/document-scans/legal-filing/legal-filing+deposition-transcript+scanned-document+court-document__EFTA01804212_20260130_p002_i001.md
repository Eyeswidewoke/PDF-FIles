Since 1993 I have been calling attention to the potential of a nuclear Iran, perhaps the most dangerous 
development in our region. Today we all understand that if Iran achieves nuclear military power, it is only a matter of 
time, a few years, before Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey will reach nuclear capacity as well. 
For Israel, that scenario is nothing short of a strategic nightmare. We will be surrounded not only by a nuclear 
Iran and the long-range missiles of its proxies Hezbollah and llamas in Lebanon and Gaza; but by three new nuclear 
states as well. What they have in common is an authoritarian regime, overwhelmingly influenced by radical Islamist 
movements. 
As tough as this neighborhood has been, Israel has survived due to its military superiority. Should the region go 
nuclear, that superiority will be lost and Israel's disappearance is a matter of time. No government in Jerusalem can 
afford to neglect this disturbing reality; no government has the moral authority to allow this fate for our children. 
The current Israeli government desperately needs support of friends in the international arena, and support of 
countries in the region which share the fear of Iran. Sadly, its political behavior, the courting and appeasing of extremist, 
violent settlers in the West Bank, has succeeded in isolating Israel at a time when collaboration and coordination of the 
highest order is called for. 
Prime Minister Netanyahu, who takes great pride in securing the future of the Jewish people, is playing high 
stakes political games that are leaving Israel almost alone in confronting the Iranian threat. His "success" in turning the 
U.S. President into a hostage of cynical political maneuvers in an election year will, sadly, be proven to not only be 
counterproductive but as undermining our security well into the future. 
The unprecedented record of support of President Obama to Israel's defense capabilities is well known in 
security circles, and undoubtedly by Netanyahu as well. The president has enabled the deployment of special early-
warning radar in the Negev; the generous support for Israel's anti-missile defense projects ("Iron Dome", "David's 
Slinge", "Arrow-3") which dramatically helps the build-up of our anti-rocket, anti-missile shield; quick assistance during 
the attack on our Embassy in Egypt, are a just a few examples. 
In the war against Islamist terrorism, Obama expended the use of precision-guided ammunition in a way no 
previous administration has before it. He didn't lecture us about punishing the arch-terrorists, he simply did it. These 
actions turned the world into a less dangerous place, for Israel as well. 
These two achievements unquestionably upend the rightwing accusations that the US President "threw Israel 
under the bus". 
But, unfortunately, Obama has adopted an approach of near total passivity on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Moreover, he went out of his way to punish the Palestinian Authority for the "unpardonable sin" of trying to obtain UN 
recognition. This misguided policy will not encourage peace in the Middle East, nor will it convince Jewish voters who 
oppose him. 
What is called for is an assertive policy and sustained commitment of action, even during an election year. This 
means vis-à-vis Iran, too. In July 2010 President Obama signed into law tough sanctions against companies involved in 
energy trade with Iran. Between July and October 2010 several major international companies cut their business with 
Iran. But since October 2010 not a single important company did so. Why? Because the energy companies quickly 
learned that the sanctions are not really being implemented. For a short time following the unveiling of the plot to kill 
the Saudi Ambassador, there were rumors that real "crippling sanctions" are underway, including a boycott of the 
Iranian central bank. The recently declared sanctions are partial and not sufficient. 
Instead, official Washington continues to toy with the naive illusion of "re-educating Tehran". I heard such 
beliefs in a closed forum with a senior State Department official who spoke about the hope that Iran will "return to the
