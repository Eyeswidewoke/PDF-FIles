Opportunity Zone Overview 
• GTIS Qualified Opportunity Fund LLC ("Fund") will target investments in select Qualified 
Opportunity Zones (QOZs), underserved areas designated by the 2017 Tax and Jobs Act 
• QOZ investments can qualify for substantial tax benefits at federal as well as state level: 
1) Tax deferral of capital gains until 2026 from almost any investment- stocks, 
real estate, art, business sale, K1 partnership gains 
2) Tax reduction on the rollover gain by 10% if investment in QOZ is held for at 
least 5 years, or 15% if held for 7 years by end of 2026 
3) Tax elimination for gain on the new QOZ fund investment if held for >10 years 
• Zone locations are quite wide ranging, not just distressed areas (>10,000 ZIP codes, 
76% large urban MSAs) and have clear potential as well as need for investment 
• Expected to become the largest economic development and tax incentive program in 
the last few decades as concentration of capital transforms communities over time 
• QOZ regulations lead to development oriented strategy, as they require 
1) Original use of a ground up development in a 002, or 
2) Substantial improvement by investing more than the original basis (ex land) 
GTIS Firm Overview 
• Real estate fund manager founded in 2005 with $4.7 billion of AuM focused on the U.S. and 
Brazilel with 94 employees located across seven offices 
• While experienced across all asset classes, GTIS strategy in the US is focused on residential and 
mixed use development in areas similar to OpportunityZones 
• Over $1.4 billion of equity capital committed to 81 residential p 
in 30 markets comprising 
$7.1 billion in total project costal 
• Over $12•3 million of equity committed to 7 projects that are now located in Opportunity Zones, 
including 1.8 million square feet of commercial space and 4,000 planned residential units 
• Principals have development and operating background, but the firm invests as a capital alkxator, 
leading to a hytindAllocator/Operator model well suited for the QOZ strategy— enables 
diversification across markets with local partners but also direct development oversight 
• Established fund management platform with extensive tax and structuring experience, 
and an investor base including some of the world's largest pensions and endowments 
GTIS Qualified Opportunity Zone Strategy 
• Diversified — invest in residential and commercial development in up-and-coming 
areas of major gateways (e.g. NY, SF) and select next-tier markets (e.g. PHX, ATL, DAL) 
Focused on growth markets — urban as well as suburban development (e.g. Multifamily 
and Single family rental) with a focus on sunbelt markets that have stronger 
demographics, job growth, and business friendly climate 
• Balanced portfolio — 10-15 'bite sized' assets (target $20-$50M commitment) vs. one-
off mega deals that carry idiosyncratic risks 
• Commingled fund — REIT structure enables commingled pool with the flexibility to exit 
through IPO or individual property sales, and manager incentive tied to overall fund 
performance (fund-wide promote vs. deal-by-deal) 
• Extensive sourcing network — prior investments with over 30 local development 
partners, and investment presence in 15 out of the 16 target markets 
• Proprietary research — dedicated research team and tools developed to evaluate 
markets and submarkets to select QOZs with the most potential 
• Identified pipeline — $250M+ pipeline diversified across property types and markets, as 
a direct continuation of GTIS investment strategy carried out over the past 10 years
