Subject without a doubt , one of the smartest people i have ever met, 
without a doubt , one of the smartest people i have ever met, 
he is not fluent in spanish french or italian however he is 
he is multilingual in the areas of advanced science. He can conduct a seminar in fields as diverse 
as evolutionary biology, computational neuro science. n dimensional manifolds. , or music as a 
lens into the brain. His interests arc so far ranging that encompass , signal intelligence, power law 
distributions , and encryption. 
I am well aware that in his past he has made some awful decisions, and would have done 
differently if he had the opportunity to do them over. however he has paid his debt to society, 
asked his friends and family for forgiveness and has continued his charitable work that he began 
decades ago. 
i have had the privilege to meet the worlds greatest minds, and i can easily say that Jeffrey s is 
amongst the best of those. 
I have utmost confidence in his integrity. I have dealt with him for a number of years on both 
sides of a negotiation and say with certainty that I;d rather be on his side. 
He has been in the Billionaire business for longer than almost anyone else. His insight into the 
unique problems of the super wealthy , has been invaluable to many others that i know 
ability with numbers , complex concepts. sometimes brutal honesty, refreshing, a sense of 
humor that some find highly cultured others find just outright silly, 
HIs homes are probably the best collection of real estate in the united states. A private island , 
that some describe as a tribute to megalomania. and a ranch in new mexico that is truly beyond 
imagination and my favorite townhouse in NY. HIs attention to detail is remarkable . I find it 
sad that he doesn't have children of his own, but makes up for it by maintaining close friendships 
that have lasted for decades. 
His chariblae instincts have been honed over many years and his advice and judgment has been 
invaluable in several instances. 
His ability to explain complex derivatives or concepts on the bleeding edge of science in layman's 
terms is part of his teaching gene. 
I have met many people who criticize those who maintain a friendship with Jeffrey, and a group 
whose opinions are impervious to change , however, in the vast majority of cases , it is with those 
that have not had the opportunity to sit with him watch as his mind performs an intellectual! 
ballet. gracefully moving from one difficult topic and transitioning to another seemingly unrelated 
, only at the end to have the thread pulled tightly and ending with an elegant coda. finale. 
I can call him and ask , can you explain this to me, and with an impish respond, and a breath of 
fresh air, if he can't , he simply says I Don't know..
