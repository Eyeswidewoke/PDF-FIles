come back from the dead, although in some industries (notably airlines) at the expense of more profitable rivals. 
The system has the great benefit of clarity, with the court ensuring that the creditors are paid in order of 
seniority, with secured lenders getting first cut. Even so, the system struggled to cope with the sheer complexity 
of Lehman Brothers' failure. The investment bank became the largest ever Chapter 11 deal, involving loans of 
$640 billion. 
In Europe bankruptcy law is undergoing steady reform. "It used to be completely impossible to deal with cross-
border failures," says Alan Bloom, head of restructuring at Ernst & Young, an accountancy group. That was before 
Europe-wide insolvency arrangements for dealing with multinationals were introduced in 2005. But it still leaves 
the issue of which country's courts control the process. That depends on which nation is the "centre of main 
interest" for the company. There is scope for some legal arbitrage: Wind Hellas, a Greek telecoms company with 
headquarters in Luxembourg, managed to shift its centre of interest to Britain so it could restructure in the British 
courts. Generally speaking, Britain is deemed to have the most creditor-friendly approach. 
At the opposite end of the scale is France with its sauvegarde scheme, where the priority is to save the business 
and the employees, with the creditors taking third place. Only the debtor can apply for sauvegarde. The 
company has to present a repayment plan to the court, but the court can reject it and impose a plan of its own. 
The plan also requires a majority vote, with large creditors able to vote down small ones and unsecured creditors 
able to outvote the secured. Debt repayment can be slow; even under a court order, it can take up to ten years. 
"It looks brutal to creditors but this is often the subject of pre-negotiation," says Alan Mason of the Paris office of 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Derringer, a corporate-law firm. There are signs that firms, under pressure from creditors, 
are reorganising themselves to avoid sauvegarde. 
With lenders in most countries seeing their rights under bankruptcy law curtailed, they might have been expected 
to insist on more safeguards upfront. Far from it. At the peak of the lending boom in 2006 and 2007, the fashion 
was for "covenant lite" deals which gave creditors fewer safeguards; traditionally, covenants were used to force 
debt repayment when the debtor missed certain financial targets. But investors were so keen to chase higher 
yields that they were willing to dispense with these protections. A lot of this had to do with the "shadow finance" 
industry of non-bank institutions and lenders, and the structured products (such as CDOs and CLOs) it created. 
The industry had such an appetite for debt to feed these beasts that creditors were inclined to lend first and ask 
questions afterwards. 
Now that the reckoning has come, sorting out the finances of troubled companies has become far more complex. 
"It used to be that a relatively small number of banks owned a company's debt," says Matthew Prest of Moelis, a 
company that specialises in debt restructuring. "When things went wrong, the company knew whom to call." The 
banks, for their part, specialised in analysing credit and had workout teams to deal with trouble. These days 
companies may have several different types of debt, or leveraged loans that have been repackaged and sold 
round the world. 
The interests of the owners of different slices of debt are often at odds with each other, a state of affairs known as 
tranche warfare. Those who own the most senior securities in CDOs and CLOs, ranked AAA or AA, might want to 
sell the company's assets immediately to ensure they get their money back. But the owners of the more risky 
types of debt would be wiped out by that, so they usually want to hang on in the hope that the company's 
prospects improve. The owners of the riskiest tranches often have the most voting power. 
One potential conflict, says Andrew Speirs of Hawkpoint, a firm that advises on corporate finance, is between 
distressed-debt managers and the original debt holders. The first group has bought the bonds or loans at a 
discount and is looking for a quick return; the second, having paid the full price, would prefer to hold on in hope 
of a higher payout. 
Delay and pray 
In the CLO market, which largely consists of loans made to private-equity groups, there are special reasons to be 
patient with struggling borrowers. The private-equity managers have little interest in restructuring the debt, since
