Public Service Co. v. U.S. <https://maps.google.com/?=.U.S.,+435+U.S.+21&entry=gmail&source=g> , 435 U.S. 21 (1978), 
held, with respect to payroll tax withholdings, that a company that is required to collect=a tax (a "deputy tax collector") 
can only be held liable for unc=llected tax if published legal authority provided clear and precise guidance regarding the 
deputy tax collector's obligation to collect the tax. Published court cases do not discuss whether this case=applies in the 
context of FET. However, because management companies appea= to be deputy tax collectors required (according to 
the IRS auditors) to c=llect FET on amounts paid by the aircraft owners, it would appear to follow that management 
companies can o=ly be held liable for uncollected FET if published legal guidance met this=clear and precise standard. 
As noted=below, the sole reason for opening a guidance project on the issue is that=the existing published legal 
authority does not provide clear guidance. Accordingly, it would seem that management compani=s have a fairly 
straightforward argument that (a) they can only be liable =or failure to collect FET if the published legal guidance 
regarding their =ollection responsibility is clear and precise, and (b) the suspension of assessments and opening of a 
guidan=e project effectively concedes that existing guidance regarding owner flig=ts does not meet this standard. Based 
on this and other arguments, managem=nt companies with cases in Appeals may prefer to continue to work with 
Appeals to resolve their cases.=u> 
Manageme=t companies that are currently under audit and are considering the effect =f the suspension on their 
case should consider that the clear and precise guidance standard requires that such guidance e=ist at the time that the 
deputy tax collector was required to collect the =ax. Therefore, if the clear and precise standard applies, regulations 
issu=d in the future cannot retroactively provide clear and precise guidance to prior periods when the tax was not 
c=llected. 
Backg=ound Meetings Leading Up to the Suspension on Assessments 
The susp=nsion on assessments and the IRS's tentative commitment to initiate a =uidance project on this issue is 
the result of a series of meetings between NBAA representatives and the IRS over the past five ye=rs. The following 
briefly summarizes this effort: 
• 
=C2 In 2008, the IRS issued an Audit Technique Guide suggesting that per=orming aircraft management 
services would result in the management company=having possession, command, and control of the aircraft. 
• 
=C2 During the period 2008 to 2011, NBAA representatives met with IRS re=resentatives several times 
and provided written memoranda regarding the is=ue with the intention of cooperatively developing guidance in an 
Industry Directive. 
• 
=C2 In the Summer of 2011, NBAA representatives met with representatives=of IRS to discuss the issue. 
At this meeting, the IRS seemed committed to =orking with industry on the issue. 
• 
=C2 However, the IRS then requested guidance from the IRS Chief Counsel&=39;s Office on the issue, 
and in March 2012, CCA 201210026 was issued indi=ating that management services companies have possession, 
command, and control of managed aircraft, unless their services were perfo=med in the capacity of an agent of the 
owner. 
• 
=C2 Following the issuance of this CCA, the IRS aggressively increased a=dits of managed aircraft. 
• 
=C2 In April and June 2012, NBAA representatives met with the IRS Chief =ounsel's Office and provided 
a written industry response to the CCA. 
• 
=C2 In December 2012, NBAA and NATA representatives met with Chief Couns=l's Office attorneys and 
submitted a draft Chief Counsel's Advice =o correct the CCA. 
• 
=C2 In February 2013, NBAA and NATA provided a memorandum to the Chief C=unsel's Office attorneys 
explaining that Rev. Rul. 74.123 does not pro=ide clear guidance that owner flights on managed aircraft are taxable 
transportation. 
• 
=C2 In March 2013, NBAA and NATA representatives again met with the Chie= Counsel's Office 
attorneys who agreed in general terms that existing =ublished guidance does not provide clear guidance on the issue. At 
the meeting, the Chief Counsel's Office attorneys stated=that they would support a request for guidance on the issue 
(such as a reg=lations project) and recommended that we meet with SBSE regarding audits o= management companies.
