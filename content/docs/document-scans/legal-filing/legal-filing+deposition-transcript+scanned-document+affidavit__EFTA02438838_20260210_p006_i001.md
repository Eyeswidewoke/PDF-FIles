him front and centre with the banks not only to answer their questions about J.P. Morgan, but to 
also to make him available as a thought leader in the space of risk management. Our local banking 
partners here in China are terribly interested in knowing just how we go about doing things; and 
that's what we want to tell them. 
What we're doing now is coming up with a very disciplined approach to visits from New York 
and the region on an on-going and regular basis; and funnily enough, we'd like to see the 
conversations elevated above J.P. Morgan to the level of the industry, thereby informing the 
dialogue beyond the parochial. 
For example, when Jamie Dimon was recently here, he met with regulators and clients at the top 
of the houses. He wants that approach to be echoed throughout our organization. So, we each 
look after different levels of these relationships in a fashion that best suits the bank. By the way, 
he's very keen on regulators and governance. Jamie is profoundly committed to risk management--
an worthwhile combination—thank goodness. 
TAB: In light of the love for the regulators at J.P. Morgan, how are you coordinating...after 
Lehman Brothers, after the last couple of months, how is JP Morgan coordinating differently with 
the regulators and what are they telling you? 
Lighte:Our approach is not necessarily problem driven. If we have on-going dialogues with the 
regulators, surprises are minimized. In China, despite the rigor of the regulators, it's very 
important that you have relationships with them. It doesn't necessarily make message any easier. 
It's no walk in the park. Rather, It's just easier to tell your story and easier to get an answer. 
TAB: What are they asking you and also what are they telling you? Would you expect or are they 
discussing any major new regulatory or supervisory changes? 
Lightc: The LIBs are pretty closely regulated anyway, so new and onerous regulations are not 
expected. By the way, I think the messages always seem heavier if you're not in regular touch 
with the regulators. 
We know what the drill is, so we always strive to be compliant and we always strive to tell them 
our plans. Just the exercise of building out the branches has brought us into deep and constant 
contact with them on a regular basis. We see them a lot. I think it's all to the good. 
TAB: In terms of product composition and product composition strategy, would you foresee any 
shifts in light of the current situation for JP Morgan and here in China specifically? 
Lighte: No, because when you're in a situation like this, it's back to basics. Nobody really is keen 
to talk about terribly complex structures at this time. It's funny, nobody wants to be an 
inarticulate genius at this moment; it's perilous, in a funny kind of way. People really want to do 
the kind of banking now that they can understand because I think there's a fear now of not being 
able to explain things. I only hope that the good times in the future don't wipe out the desire to 
understand.
