convertible security is determined by the market price of the underlying common stock. If the 
conversion value is low relative to the investment value, the price of the convertible security is 
governed principally by its investment value. To the extent the market price of the underlying 
common stock approaches or exceeds the conversion price, the price of the convertible security 
will be increasingly influenced by its conversion value. A convertible security generally will sell 
at a premium over its conversion value by the extent to which investors place value on the right to 
acquire the underlying common stock while holding a fixed-income security. Generally, the 
amount of the premium decreases as the convertible security approaches maturity. 
A contingent convertible security (known as "Co-Cos") is a hybrid security that is only 
convertible under certain conditions (for example, the right to convert can only be exercised if the 
price of the underlying stock is a certain percentage over the conversion price). A convertible 
security may be subject to redemption at the option of the issuer at a price established in the 
convertible security's governing instrument. If a convertible security held by an Underlying Fund 
is called for redemption, the Underlying Fund will be required to permit the issuer to redeem the 
security, convert it into the underlying common stock or sell it to a third party. Furthermore, an 
issuer could refuse to permit an Underlying Fund to convert the convertible security into the 
underlying common stock, despite its obligation to do so. Any of these actions could have an 
adverse effect on an Underlying Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective. 
ETFs 
The public trading price of shares in an Exchange-Traded Fund ("ETF") may be different 
from the net asset value of such shares i.e. ETF shares may trade at a premium over, or a discount 
to, the net asset values of such shares) and similarly, the public trading market price per ETF share 
may be different from the net asset value per ETF share. ETF arbitrage strategies are designed to 
profit from such deviations. The exploitation of such arbitrage opportunities should tend to cause 
the public trading price to track net asset value per share closely over time, thus limiting the 
opportunities for arbitrage. 
ETF shares are listed for trading on exchanges. Trading in such shares may be halted due 
to market conditions or, in light of exchange rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of 
the relevant exchange, make trading in the ETF shares inadvisable. In addition, trading is subject 
to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to "circuit breaker" rules that 
require trading to be halted for a specific period based on a specified market decline. There can 
be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of any ETF's shares will 
continue to be met or will remain unchanged. 
Although it is anticipated that the ETF shares will be listed and traded on exchanges, there 
can be no guarantee that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained. 
If an Underlying Fund needs to sell ETF shares at a time when no active market for them exists, 
the price it receives for such shares, assuming that the Underlying Fund is able to sell them, likely 
will be lower than that it would receive if an active market did exist. In addition, certain ETFs 
arbitrage strategies require an Underlying Fund to be able to redeem or create ETF shares. If the 
Underlying Fund is unable to do so, the strategy could be rendered unprofitable.
