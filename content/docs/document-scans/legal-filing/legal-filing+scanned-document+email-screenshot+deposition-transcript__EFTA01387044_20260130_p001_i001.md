The repricing of premium across EM that we have highlighted over the past six+ weeks is starting to show 
some signs of overshooting in FX. But we avoid retracement trades before uncertainty about US taxes and 
Fed is resolved and we see fatigue in the repricing of growth via weaker equities.

Economics Focus: In Asia, we expect Taiwan's GDP growth to accelerate in Q3 and South Korea's CPI 
inflation and export growth to fall in October. In EMEA, we believe CNB will hike the policy rate by 25bps next 
week. While October inflation is likely to decline in Poland and Russia, it should accelerate in Turkey. In 
LatAm, the COPOM minutes on Tuesday should reinforce a final 50bp cut next while leaving the door open for 
more. Watch for some deceleration in Mexico's Q3 GDP as private consumption continues to decline at the 
margin. 
Strategy Focus: The repricing of premium across EM that we have highlighted over the past six+ weeks is 
starting to show some signs of overshooting in FX. But we avoid retracement trades before uncertainty about 
US taxes and Fed is resolved and we see fatigue in the repricing of growth via weaker equities. 
• 
FX: Increased correlation with US yields and overshooting vs. DXY (observed in the underperformance 
vs. EUR since mid-October) point to pent-up FX-hedging demand for local bonds. This is unlikely to reverse 
before the pressure on core yields ease. The contribution of idiosyncratic shocks in TRY, ZAR, MXN and (less 
so) BRL has amplified this unfavorable backdrop. RUB remains the last bastion of carry, but we tighten stop on 
heavy positioning. We maintain a bullish medium-term view on BRL (vs. EUR and wait to re-enter vs. USD) on 
flows and economic upturn, while keeping USD/MXN longs. Open long USD/ILS on valuation and potential for 
Bol intervention. Add USD/KRW puts and keep SGD funding in Asia. 
• 
Rates: We are comfortable recommending short-end receivers where inflation dynamics and real rates 
are supportive as in Brazil (where we now see 100bp of value in JuI18/Jan19 FRA), Russia, and Colombia. We 
closed our ASW compression trade in ZAR and see some short-end pull-back before elections and possible 
downgrade in November. We see TRY as the best vehicle to position for retracement in Turkey — but once it 
trades more orderly. Having been skeptical about duration we note that interest rate differentials vs. DM are 
still near lows. We see relatively high term premium in Peru (but tighten stop), Hungary (favoring flatteners), 
and Israel (vs. US payers), but keep steepeners in Asia and CZK. Favor ARS floaters (Bocan 20s) and hard 
currency for duration. 
• 
Credit: Idiosyncratic factors have been dominant over the past week, including. Venezuela/PDVSA 
payment deadlines (PDVSA CDS could be triggered if 20s' amortization is not paid by Wednesday). Stay 
neutral South Africa as spreads price in downgrades and retain 5s10s cash curve flatteners.
