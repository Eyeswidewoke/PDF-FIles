$600 or bust. Speaker Pelosi said the other day, which I thought was a great line: 'We don't 
have red lines, we have values. And we're going into these negotiations with values." The Wall 
Street Journal (7/28, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) looks at how the Democratic and GOP 
plans compare. 
GOP Bill Replaces Spending On Defense Programs Canceled To Fund Border Wall. 
The Washington Post (7/28, Werner, Demirjian, 14.2M) reports that Senate Republicans' "new 
$1 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill restores hundreds of millions of dollars in Pentagon spending 
that the Trump administration redirected to help pay for President Trump's border wall." 
According to the Post, "Navy planes and ships and Air Force aircraft that the Trump 
administration canceled earlier this year so the money could go to pay for the wall have 
reappeared in the GOP bill that was introduced on Monday." 
House Panel Expected To Question Tech CEOs On Antitrust Issues, Social Media 
Accountability. 
The AP (7/28, Gordon) reports Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai, 
and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg will appear before the House Judiciary Committee on 
Wednesday, where they "will answer for their companies' practices before Congress for the first 
time as a group." They will do so "in the manner of tycoons of Wall Street or the tobacco 
industry in earlier high-octane televised shamings." The panel's hearing "cap[s] its yearlong 
investigation of Big Tech's market dominance." CNBC (7/28, Feiner, 3.62M) says on its website, 
"Regardless of how well-practiced the CEOs are when they take the witness stand, their 
testimonies will offer an important insight: how they are handling antitrust challenges from 
regulators with the authority to break them up." The Wall Street Journal (7/28, Tracy, 
McKinnon, Glazer, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) quotes Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), who 
chairs the Antitrust Subcommittee, saying, "These platforms have been allowed to run wild and 
free from really any constraints. The responsibility we have is to make clear what the impacts 
are of the lack of competition in the digital marketplace." 
The New York Times (7/28, Kang, Nicas, McCabe, 18.61M) quotes Gigi Sohn, "a former 
senior adviser at the Federal Communications Commission and a fellow at Georgetown 
University's law school," as saying, "It has the feeling of tech's Big Tobacco moment." The Times 
says Republicans are "expected to sidetrack discussion with their concerns of liberal bias at the 
Silicon Valley companies and accusations that conservative voices are censored." The 
Washington Post (7/28, Zakrzewski, 14.2M) similarly says, "There are signs Republicans intend 
to raise unproven accusations that tech companies are biased against conservatives." On 
Monday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) wrote to Attorney General Barr "seeking a Justice Department 
investigation into whether Mark Zuckerberg lied in his 2018 testimony when he said that 
Facebook doesn't make content decisions based on political ideology." 
The New York Times (7/28, 18.61M) says in an editorial that the hearing "could give the 
public a rare glimpse into the inner workings of some of the world's most valuable companies. 
... The challenge for the subcommittee will be in establishing whether these tech companies -
which have amassed immeasurable power - operate as illegal monopolies in certain domains, 
such as online search (Google), online marketplaces (Amazon), mobile phone app stores 
(Apple), the dissemination of information (Facebook), advertising sales (Google and Facebook) 
and mergers and acquisitions." 
Hawley Bill Links Ad Practices To Content Liability Shield. Reuters (7/28, Bose) 
reports that on Tuesday, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced legislation "that would penalize 
large tech companies that sell or show targeted advertisements by threatening a legal 
immunity enjoyed by the industry." According to Reuters, "The bill, titled 'Behavioral Advertising 
Decisions Are Downgrading Services (Bad Ads) Act,' aims to crack down on invasive data 
gathering by large technology companies such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google that target 
users based on their behavioral insights."
