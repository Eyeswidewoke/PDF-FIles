As a buyer of credit default swaps, an Underlying Fund is subject to certain risks in addition 
to those described under "—Derivatives," above. In circumstances in which an Underlying Fund 
does not own the debt securities that are deliverable under a credit default swap, an Underlying 
Fund is exposed to the risk that deliverable securities will not be available in the market, or will 
be available only at unfavorable prices, as would be the case in a so-called "short squeeze." While 
the credit default swap market auction protocols reduce this risk, it is still possible that an auction 
will not be organized or will not be successful. In certain instances of issuer defaults or 
restructurings, it has been unclear under the standard industry documentation for credit default 
swaps whether or not a "credit event" triggering the seller's payment obligation had occurred. The 
creation of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Credit Derivatives Determination 
Committee (the "Determination Committee") is intended to reduce this uncertainty and create 
uniformity across the market, although it is possible that the Determination Committee will not be 
able to reach a resolution or do so on a timely basis. In either of these cases, an Underlying Fund 
would not be able to realize the fid I value of the credit default swap upon a default by the reference 
entity. 
As a seller of credit default swaps, an Underlying Fund incurs leveraged exposure to the 
credit of the reference entity and is subject to many of the same risks it would incur if it were 
holding debt securities issued by the reference entity. However, an Underlying Fund will not have 
any legal recourse against the reference entity and may not benefit from any collateral securing the 
reference entity's debt obligations. In addition, the credit default swap buyer may have broad 
discretion to select which of the reference entity's debt obligations to deliver to an Underlying 
Fund following a credit event and may choose the obligations with the lowest market value in 
order to maximize the payment obligations of the Underlying Fund. 
The Underlying Funds also enter into credit default swap recovery locks. Under a recovery 
swap, the parties agree in advance to the recovery rate if a credit event occurs with respect to the 
reference entity. The actual price of the debt securities of the reference entity at the time of the 
credit event may be more or less than the agreed upon recovery rate. 
In addition, credit default swaps generally trade on the basis of theoretical pricing and 
valuation models, which may not accurately value such swap positions when established or when 
subsequently traded or unwound under actual market conditions. The credit default market may 
become subject to increased regulation, which could increase costs or even prevent participation 
by an Underlying Fund. 
The credit default swap market in high yield securities is comparatively new and rapidly 
evolving compared to the credit default swap market for more seasoned and liquid investment 
grade Securities. Swap transactions dependent upon credit events are priced incorporating many 
variables including the pricing and volatility of the common stock, potential loss upon default and 
the shape of the U.S. Treasury Yield curve, among other factors. As such, there are many factors 
upon which market participants may have divergent views. 
Non-U.S. Securities and Emerging Markets 
The Underlying Funds trade and invest in Securities of companies domiciled or operating 
in one or more non-U.S. countries and makes other investments in entities located outside the U.S.,
