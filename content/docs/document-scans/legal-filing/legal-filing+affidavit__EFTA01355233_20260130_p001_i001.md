Section 8: Conflicts of Interest 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV. LP 
Conflicts of Interest 
General 
Investors should be aware that there will be situations where the Manager and its affiliates may encounter potential 
conflicts of interest in connection with the Fund's investment activities. The following discussion details certain potential 
conflicts of interest that should be carefully considered before making an investment in the Fund. By acquiring an Interest 
and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence 
of any such actual and potential conflicts of interest and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from 
the existence of any such conflict of interest. 
The Fund will be dependent on the Manager to identify and manage all such conflicts of interest. The General Partner 
and the Manager will consult with the Fund Advisory Committee with respect to material issues involving actual or 
potential significant conflicts of interest, methods of valuation and certain other matters in accordance with the Fund 
Partnership Agreement, unless the General Partner and the Manager have been advised by counsel that disclosure of 
such potential or actual conflict of interest is. or may reasonably be, prohibited for regulatory or legal reasons (in which 
case. where the conflict cannot be satisfactorily resolved, the applicable transaction may not be consummated). 
The following non-exhaustive discussion sets forth certain potential conflicts of interest. In the Fund Documents, 
Investors will be required to acknowledge and consent to the existence of the conflicts of interest described. 
Conflicts among certain Investors 
Investors may have conflicting investment, tax and other interests with respect to their investments in the Fund. As a 
consequence and in connection with decisions made by the Fund, including with respect to the nature or structuring of 
investments. decisions may be more beneficial for one Investor than for another Investor, especially with respect to 
particular tax situations of the Investors. In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for the Fund, the Manager 
will consider the investment and tax objectives of the Fund and the Investors as a whole, not the investment, tax or other 
objectives of any specific Investor. 
Broken deal expenses and abort fees 
My broken deal expenses or abort fees relating to any investment opportunity that is not consummated will be allocated 
entirely to the Fund and not to any other co-investor unless such co•investor has agreed otherwise. 
Investment by members of the management team 
Partners and employees of the Manager and the U.S. Adviser may invest personal funds directly or indirectly into the 
Fund or through other parallel investment entities. As such, their decisions may be influenced by the presence of their 
investment, and may not be completely unbiased. 
Carried Interest 
The entitlement of certain partners and employees of the Manager and the U.S. Adviser to receive the economic benefit 
of the Carried Interest received by the Special Limited Partner may create an incentive for the Manager to make more 
speculative investments on behalf of the Fund than it would otherwise make in the absence of such Carried Interest. The 
existence of Carried Interest and its tax treatment may result in conflicts of interest between the Manager and Investors 
with respect to the management and disposition of investments and the determination of the order, timing and amount of 
distributions by the Fund.
