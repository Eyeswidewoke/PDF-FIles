$3.1 billion it gives Israel annually. Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) introduced a resolution calling for an immediate end to 
the harassment and prosecution of NGO staff. Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) went much further when he introduced 
legislation that would suspend all U.S. aid to Egypt until the matter is resolved. On Monday, a group of U.S. senators 
including John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) visited Cairo to meet with Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein 
Tantawi and other Egyptian leaders, trying to relieve some of the tension. They returned home with optimistic 
messages, suggesting that the Egyptian brass offered strong assurances of a swift resolution to the impasse. 
How much faith Washington can put in those assurances, however, remains to be seen. Fueling the United States' 
impatience have been Cairo's confusing, and often conflicting, messages. Unlike the Mubarak era, when there were 
relatively clear lines of command, the past year in Egypt has been marked by the rapid emergence of multiple centers of 
power competing for political control. Egypt's actual foreign policy has been almost indecipherable. For example, after 
security forces raided the NGO offices, top Egyptian officials, including Tantawi, Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri, and 
Foreign Minister Mohamed Amr, were quick to assure the United States that the maltreatment of U.S. citizens would 
cease, that all seized materials would be immediately returned, and that the offices would be able to reopen. Six weeks 
later, those have proved to be empty promises. 
Conversations in Washington reveal that U.S. officials, by and large, do not believe that their counterparts in Cairo are 
being intentionally deceptive -- they assume that the Egyptians have simply promised more than they can deliver. For 
years, Abul Naga, who is one of the few top officials remaining from the days of Mubarak, has been opposed to any 
foreign funding that bypassed her ministry. And now she seems to be targeting U.S. influence specifically. Last week, the 
Egyptian press quoted Abul Naga as having portrayed the U.S. as trying to hijack Egypt's revolution. "The United States 
decided to use all its resources and instruments to contain [the January 25 revolution]," the government's official news 
agency, MENA, quoted her as saying, "and push it in a direction that promotes American and also Israeli interests." 
But her charges against the NGOs ring hollow. For instance, the National Democratic Institute and the International 
Republican Institute have made more than reasonable efforts to comply with Egyptian law. Both groups applied for 
registration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2005 and have communicated regularly with the authorities about 
their activities and programs ever since. Both groups were told repeatedly that their registration would be granted, but 
it never was and no explanation was given. This experience is characteristic of that of many other organizations that 
have focused on politically sensitive issues, while groups with more innocuous goals have had their registration granted 
promptly. It is disingenuous for the Egyptian government to refuse to grant U.S. NGOs registration on political grounds 
and then claim that the investigation against them is an apolitical matter for the judiciary. Moreover, that many other 
international organizations operate in Egypt today without official registration underscores the selective, political nature 
of these attacks. 
Members of Egypt's ruling military council have generally avoided the issue in public, perhaps in order to give them 
plausible deniability with Washington. Privately, they consistently argue to U.S. officials that they cannot intervene in 
independent judicial processes. But even if the generals are not the driving force behind the crackdown, it is quite 
unlikely that the investigation could have moved forward without their support. The military has held executive 
authority and ultimate decision-making power for the past year -- all cabinet ministers were appointed by the generals 
and report to them. 
Assuming that Abul Naga had to get the military on board before pushing forward with the NGO persecution, her case to 
them was simple and compelling. Egyptian democracy and human rights organizations are vocal critics of the military. As 
large protests have continued, it makes sense for the ruling cadre to cut off such organizations at the knees while also 
reinforcing the public narrative that the protests are the work of foreign agents seeking to sow chaos in Egypt. 
Yet it appears that some ranking members of the Egyptian military may have severely underestimated the backlash from 
Washington. In both private conversations and public statements, Pentagon and State Department officials who have 
recently visited Egypt and discussed the crisis describe the generals as initially incredulous that such a minor issue (in 
their view) could actually threaten the aid package. U.S. officials attest that they have been successful since in conveying 
how potentially explosive the issue could be, but it is unclear how much that has changed anyone's thinking in Cairo.
