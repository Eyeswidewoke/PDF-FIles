The political syste=s in emerging powers are fraying, too. There have been huge protests in B=azil 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/brazil-once-revered-n=w-rocked-by-protest/2013/06/22/1b6c7640-db57-
11e2-b418-9dfa095e125d_story.=tml> over wasteful government spending and inadequate social programs. Russia 
l=oks more authoritarian by the day. And the Chinese Communist Party is step=ing up efforts to crack down 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/chinas-leader-xi-jinp=ng-consolidates-power-with-crackdowns-on-corruption-
internet/2013/10/01/fd=ceeee-leb7-11e3-9ad0-96244100e647_story.html> on journalists, academics and bloggers in 
what seems to be an attempt to c=ntrol the discontent that accompanies slower growth and painful economic r=forms. 
These "rising pow=rs" are hardly faring better collectively. The international institution= they established — BRICS, the 
Shanghai Cooperation Organization and IBS= — continue to disappoint. 
At the same time, t=e United States is experiencing a turnaround of fortunes. The unemployment=rate has fallen to just 
over 7 percent from an October 2009 peak of 10 per=ent. By contrast, euro-zone unemployment remains stuck at 
around 12 percent. 
The U.S. fiscal pic=ure is also looking up. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estima=es that the annual budget 
deficit will drop below $650 billion in 201=, the smallest shortfall since 2008 and approximately half the size it was in 
2011. Meanwhile, the dollar remains =he world's top reserve currency. 
Even more transform=tive, the United States is experiencing an energy revolution that the McKi=sey Global Institute 
estimates could add as much as 4 percent to annual GD= and create up to 1.7 million new jobs by 2020. America is 
poised to overtake Russia as the world's largest pro=ucer of oil and natural gas, and there are signs that low-cost and 
abundan= energy is driving a revival of the U.S. manufacturing i=dustry 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/0=/is-u-s-manufacturing-set-for-a-comeback-or-is-it-
all-hype/> . Although the United States will have an enduring interest in stable global=energy prices, it will no longer rely 
on direct and uncertain acces= to Middle Eastern oil <http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/does-opec-still-ha=e-
the-us-over-a-barrel/2013/10/11/d3395316-2ad9-11e3-8ade-alf23cda135e_sto=y.html> , in sharp contrast to energy-
starved countries in Asia. 
In terms of hard po=er, the U.S. military is at the forefront of next-generation technologies,=including unmanned 
systems, robotics and lasers. Even more superior than i=s hardware is its software: the command and control systems to 
conduct highly advanced joint operations and major =ars. 
The United States a=so remains the linchpin of the international community. Through hard-nosed=diplomacy, economic 
pressure and the specter of military action, Washingto= has retained its ability to marshal effective multinational 
coalitions, bringing down Libya's Moammar Gaddaf=, getting weapons inspectors on the ground in Syria and embarking 
on serio=s negotiations to curb Iran's nuclear weapons program <http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-
security/ira=-nuclear-talks-enter-second-day-western-officials-call-tehrans-proposal-ve=y-useful/2013/10/16/615815f4-
364e-11e3-be86-6aeaa439845b_story.html> . You can quibble with process and style, but it's hard to argue t=at any of 
these would have happened without the United States. 
More broadly, and m=st important, the United States is blessed with a superior combination of =ound fundamentals in 
demography, geography, higher education and innovatio=. That ensures it has the people, ideas and security to thrive at 
home and on the world stage. There's a reason =lites around the world remain eager to send their fortunes, and often 
thei= families, to the United States. 
Of course, the econ=mic recovery is incomplete, and much remains to be done on the debt and gr=wth, but as <=pan 
style="font-size:18.0pt">Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr <http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-
news/car=-caught-in-us-political-crossfire-20120723-22k5b.html> =/a> aptly noted in July 2012, "America is just one 
budget deal away from ending al= talk of America being in decline." Easier said than done, but still eas=er to address 
than the mammoth challenges facing the emerging powers.
