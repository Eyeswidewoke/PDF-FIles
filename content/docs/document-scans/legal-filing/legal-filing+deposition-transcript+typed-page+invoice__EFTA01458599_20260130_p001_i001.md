® Europe (equities) 
oicril!‘ 
Europe's equities are still supported by sound economic and 
financial data such as credit growth, business surveys and 
earnings dynamics. However, we continue to stay neutral on 
European equities and favor Eurozone equities which are set 
to benefit more not only from relative U.S:
 strength, but 
also from low oil prices. 
@Japan (equities) 
C;d2,114 
eart•V. 
We upgrade Japanese equities to overweight. The market has 
now fallen by around 15% since August, probably making it 
a good time to take advantage of its underlying merits: the 
soundest regional earnings dynamics, rising dividends and 
Investment, plus major reforms in corporate governance which 
have started to bear fruit. 
0 Emerging markets (equities) 
• ..::,< 
re 
i 
After revising expected emerging-market 12-month earnings 
growth down to zero, we downgrade EM equities to 
underweight. Despite the sharp sell-off, there still could be 
further setbacks, particularly in Latin America where consensus 
estimates of 2016 earnings growth look unrealistic. 
Q.1") Financials (equities) 
•

•  
.. .7a4 
Pagaa-
We remain overweight on financials. Balance sheets continue 
to recover, dividend payments are rising and valuations remain 
moderate in historical terms In the short run, monetary policy 
should also strongly affect financials. Their recent softness 
could be reversed if the Fed started its interest-rate turnaround 
before year-end. 
®1' U.S. investment grade 
INAP-V\../

;pry, • 
.4C,M,
We return to neutral on U.S. investment grade. Risk premiums 
have widened to such an extent that they may offer a sufficient 
buffer against defaults. The Fed's postponement of its first 
rate hike also argues against an underweight. Additionally, the 
excess supply of the summer months is now leveling off. 
EUR high yield 
:AArThd 
tv,-p14 
tatta”. 
We upgrade EUR high yield to overweight. Over the medium 
term, this segment should be supported by low default rates, 
good ratings, high demand, the low share of the energy and 
mining sectors and historically high market risk premiums. 
However. Brazil and automotive issuers could dampen 
sentiment temporarily. 
()Covered bonds 
v?.VIA 
We downgrade covered bonds to underweight. These were 
not left unscathed by rising volatility and, moreover, are likely 
to be impaired by fears that the ECB might reduce its covered-
bond purchases. Short-term, the market is also suffering from 
substantial new issuance, which has exceeded demand.

This market environment should allow hedge funds to 
outperform. Nervous, sideways-trading markets are particularly 
suited to equity-market-neutral strategies and discretionary-
macro strategies, taking advantage of regional divergences.
