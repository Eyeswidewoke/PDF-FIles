another company but was unsuccessful, leaving him with personal debts. (Doc. No. 40 
[Loadman Dep. III at 1348-51.) He then filed this action in August 2010 against Banco. 
15 AnseII testified. We never were able to get full information about the environmental condition of the property. . . . Wine never 
could get r20] a full accounting of just how serious that problem was." (Doc. No. 38 at 978-79.) 'You know, the thing I would 
not wart to do as a CDC would be to submit a case to the SBA which has unresolved issues." (Id. at 1006.) 
II. LAW AND ANALYSIS 
A. Summary Judgment Standard of Review 
Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), when a motion for summary judgment is properly made and 
supported, it shall be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to 
any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." A fact is 
"material" only if its resolution will affect the outcome of the lawsuit. Anderson v. Liberty 
Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Determination of 
whether a factual issue is "genuine" requires consideration of the applicable evidentiary 
standards. Thus, in most civil cases the Court must decide "whether reasonable jurors 
could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the [non-moving party] is entitled to a 
verdict." Id. at 252. 
The party opposing the motion may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own 
pleading; rather, by affidavits or materials in the record, they must set out specific facts 
showing a genuine issue for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). ["21] A movant is not required 
to file affidavits or other similar materials negating a claim on which its opponent bears the 
burden of proof, so long as the movant relies upon the absence of an essential element in 
the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file. Celotex 
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). 
Rule 56(c)(4) requires "[a]n affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion 
must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, 
and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Mere 
conclusory allegations "are not evidence and are not adequate to support a motion for 
summary judgment." Miller v. Aladdin Temp--Rite, LLC, 72 Fed. Appx. 378, 380 (6th Cir. 
2003) (citing Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888. 110 S. Ct. 3177, 111 L. Ed. 
2d 695 (1990)). 
Summary judgment is appropriate whenever the non-moving party fails to make a showing 
sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case and on 
which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. Moreover, 
"the trial court no longer has a duty to search the entire record to establish that [-22] it is 
bereft of a genuine issue of material fact." Street v. J.C. Bradford & Co.. 886 F.2d 1472, 
1479-80 (6th Cir. 1989) (citing Frito--Lay, Inc. v. Willoughby, 863 F.2d 1029, 1034, 274 
U.S. App. D.C. 340 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). The non-moving party is under an affirmative duty to 
point out specific facts in the record as it has been established which create a genuine 
issue of material fact. Fulson v. City of Columbus, 801 F. Supp. 1, 4 (S.D. Ohio 1992). The 
non-movant must show more than a scintilla of evidence to overcome summary judgment;
