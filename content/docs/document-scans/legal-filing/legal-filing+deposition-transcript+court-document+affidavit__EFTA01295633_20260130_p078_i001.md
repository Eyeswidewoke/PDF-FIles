785 F.3d 895, "; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
transfers, not promotions. See, e.g., J.A. 1063. Still others trace back to beam mill 
supervisors, not supervisors in other departments. See, e.g., J.A. 1079-80. Plaintiffs count 
six other instances r1491 twice. See Appellant's Br. 9-10. And some of the cited 
"instances of alleged promotions discrimination" ["954] amount to no evidence at all. See, 
e.g., id. at 9 (citing J.A. 7237 -- an application for transfer -- as one instance of "promotion 
discrimination"). Most incredibly, Plaintiffs' argument — which the majority appears to adopt 
— assumes that one can find evidence of discrimination in every single instance where a 
black employee does not receive a promotion for which he applies. That concept finds no 
support in any part of our jurisprudence. Indeed, it turns the Teamsters framework into a 
circular absurdity. Plaintiffs presume that each denied promotion evidences a 
discriminatory policy or practice, even though -- under Teamsters — Plaintiffs must prove 
that a discriminatory policy or practice existed before the court may presume that a 
particular denied promotion was discriminatorily made. See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 362. 
The district court recognized, as it should have, that the anecdotal evidence was more 
substantial when it came to the beam mill. For that reason, the district court explained that 
it was willing to certify a class of those applying out of and into the beam mill. J.A. 10953-
54 & n.16. Plaintiffs ["i50] never accepted the invitation, so they remain responsible for 
proving plant-wide commonality. That effort requires a substantial showing beyond a single 
department. See, e.g., Bennett, 656 F.3d at 816 (holding that the district court properly 
declined to certify a hostile work environment class where anecdotal evidence was 
concentrated in a single department). 
Outside the beam mill, Plaintiffs at best present a few scattered anecdotes in each 
department. That's not enough. "[A] class plaintiffs attempt to prove the existence of . . . a 
consistent practice within a given department[] may fail even though discrimination against 
one or two individuals has been proved." Cooper, 467 U.S. at 878; accord Ste. Marie v. E. 
R.R. Ass'n, 650 F.2d 395, 406-07 (2d Cir. 1981). The district court might very well have 
clearly erred had it accepted such evidence. One can hardly say that it clearly erred in 
doing just the opposite. 
8. 
In a last effort to save their class-wide claim, Plaintiffs make much of other facts that do not 
relate directly to promotions. They seem to give special attention to the facts underlying 
their already-certified hostile work environment claim. The majority agrees that such 
evidence provides a "cultural backdrop" that renders an "equitable promotions system" 
essentially impossible. ["im] Maj. op. at 38. Notably, that view never appeared in Brown 
I, but references to Plaintiffs' hostile work environment claims now appear at least a dozen 
times in the majority opinion. The majority also finds evidence of a "culture" in the alleged 
fact that Nucor hired only one black supervisor before the EEOC investigation, even 
though "[t]he mere absence of minority employees in upper-level positions does not suffice 
to prove (even) a prima facie case of discrimination without a comparison to the relevant 
labor pool." Carter, 33 F.3d at 457. 
We have never held that class plaintiffs may establish a common, classwide policy of 
discrimination with mere evidence of company "culture." Other decisions, including Wal-
Mart, reject the notion that "culture" is enough. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2553; Davis,
