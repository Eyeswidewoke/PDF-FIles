Many prosecutors attempt to increase or deny bond to acquaintance child 
molesters based on dangerousness to the community. I have been asked on 
numerous occasions to testify at such hearings that I know or believe that a par-
ticular offender is a danger. Predicting future behavior is difficult. It often comes 
down to the simple fact that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. 
In these situations prosecutors rarely need an "expert" to speculate about the 
future. What they need is a dear and organized presentation of the facts. As pre-
viously stated an offender's pornography and erotica collection is the single best 
indicator of what he wants to do. It is not necessarily the best indicator of what 
he did or will do. If such a collection has been recovered, it must be reviewed, 
analyzed, and synopsized. The prosecutor then needs to communicate to the judge 
or magistrate, community, and media what this and other evidence, not some 
expert's speculation, indicates the offender fantasizes about and wants to do. Pros-
ecutors should resist the temptation to embellish, exaggerate, or speculate. 
For example if the collection included 30 pairs of children's underpants, that 
does not necessarily mean the offender molested or murdered these 30 children. 
He may have molested them and taken their underpants, fantasized about 
molesting them and taken their underpants, stolen the underpants without know-
ing whose they were, or bought them. If you know or have evidence of how he 
obtained them, inform the judge of the facts. If you do not know, simply inform 
the judge of the facts such as that he had them, where he had them, and how 
many he had. The same would be true if the offender had narrative stories about 
having sex with children. If the offender has also demonstrated that he is clever, 
manipulative, and organized with specific sexual preferences, the judge needs to 
know the facts that support that. 
In essence inform the judge of the facts of the case. The judge then must 
decide if he or she is willing to release on bond a clever, manipulative individual 
who regularly fantasizes about having sex with and keeping the underpants of 
children in the community. The evaluation is based on evidence, not speculation. 
Some judges or magistrates, however, will not or cannot understand these facts. 
They have their minds made up and do not want to be confused by the facts. 
Many of these same dynamics also apply to sentencing hearings. 
In many ways acquaintance-sexual-exploitation cases, especially those involving 
preferential sex offenders, are "slam dunks" or "like shooting fish in a barrel." 
Defense attorneys may claim entrapment or outrageous government conduct and 
file motions to suppress evidence. Defendants will deny the charges and make 
bold, public statements about their innocence. If the case has been put together 
properly, however, when the dust settles, most of these offenders plead guilty. 
Confronted with overwhelming evidence, many child molesters prefer to plead 
guilty to charges with vague names (e.g., contributing to the delinquency of 
minors, lewd and lascivious conduct, indecent liberties) so that the public will 
not know what they really did. The last thing they want is all the details of their 
behavior to come out in open court. They work the best plea bargain they can, 
say they are guilty when the judge asks, and then tell everyone else why they are 
really not guilty.
