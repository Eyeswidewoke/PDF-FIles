of these factors, the performance of each of the Underlying Funds and any Other Account will 
diverge. 
"New Issue" Trading 
An Underlying Fund may trade in "new issues" (initial public offerings of equity 
securities). Certain Limited Partners will be limited, under applicable FINRA rules, from 
participating in the profits and losses generated by "new issues." In addition, the Partnership may 
limit the participation of certain Limited Partners in "new issues" to an extent not required by 
FINRA. Limited Partners who receive "new issue" allocations which is less than such Limited 
Partners' respective proportionate shares will not be compensated in any respect for any such 
disproportionate allocations. (See "Allocation of Gains and Losses; Incentive Allocation.") 
Valuation Risk; Use of Estimates 
The Underlying Funds' positions are valued using the methodologies described herein and 
the Administrator calculates the net asset value of the Partnership based on pricing information 
gathered. 
Such valuations will affect the Management Fees received by the Management 
Company and the Incentive Allocations received by the General Partner. 
The values of the Underlying Funds' positions are based, to the extent possible, on 
independent third-party pricing sources, which may include quotes provided by brokers and 
dealers and Valuation Agents. However, it is not unusual for the prices quoted by dealers for 
informational purposes to materially differ from the prices at which the same dealers are willing 
to actually enter into transactions. This discrepancy can cause unexpected net asset value declines 
if an Underlying Fund is required to sell a position which it had been valuing based upon dealers' 
marks. Moreover, certain valuations cannot be made on the basis of third-party pricing sources. 
The fair market value of those investments of an Underlying Fund for which a reliable third-party 
quote is not available is based on other relevant sources deemed reliable by a Valuation Agent and 
other third-party valuation agents as well as the General Partner, in their good faith judgment. To 
the extent that there is a pricing uncertainty beyond acceptable tolerances, the final authority 
ultimately rests with the General Partner to resolve such uncertainty. The General Partner will not 
bear any liability if a price, reasonably believed by it to be an accurate valuation of a particular 
direct or indirect investment of the Underlying Funds, is subsequently found to be inaccurate. 
The General Partner must depend on the valuations furnished to the General Partner by the 
Third-Party Ventures. In the case of the Underlying Funds' passive investments with certain 
Third-Party Ventures, the General Partner may have no means of verifying the valuations provided 
to the Partnership, and such valuations may be subject to material correction and/or restatement 
over time. 
Possibility of Qualified Audit Report 
If an Underlying Fund's illiquid investments substantially increase, there is the possibility, 
albeit remote, of the Underlying Fund not being able to determine the "fair value" of a material 
component of its portfolio. This could result in the auditors' report on the Partnership's financial 
statements being qualified with respect to their departure from the "fair value" requirements of
