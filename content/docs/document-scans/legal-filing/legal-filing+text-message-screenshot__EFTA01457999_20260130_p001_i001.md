Interview 
The big picture 
Crises create opportunities: Greece and Europe must take the next steps 
The chances of 
restructuring Greece 
have never been 
higher. 
Mr. Wohrmann, once more, we have to 
talk about Greece. Although Greece's 
influence on the world and even on the 
European economy is limited, the Greek 
crisis was still felt on U.S. and Asian stock 
exchanges. One reason for this sensitivity 
is that the functioning of monetary unions 
is of global interest. How do you assess 
the Brussels compromise? 
I think it is a good political solution in 
the present circumstances. Politics is 
the art of the possible, not necessarily 
the implementation of the economic 
optimum. However, what we are talking 
about here is a fragile, protracted process. 
As slowly as Greece was sliding towards 
"Grexit", it is now moving away from 
it. Greece will have to deliver reforms 
permanently with further aid only granted 
step by step. But this also offers a great 
opportunity to the Greek government The 
neceeetty of change serves as a protective 
shield against domestic attacks. Now 
the Tsipras government must articulate a 
viable domestic agenda. Neither turning 
back nor standing still is an option any 
longer. The chances of restructuring 
Greece have never been higher. 
Do you think that the Greek population 
shares this optimism? 
Greece will need a cross-party, societal 
and foreign-policy consensus in order to 
seize this opportunity. Capital controls -
as well as some elements of the rescue 
package which reduce demand - are 
hampering growth, which could be 
politically explosive. 
And could still lead to "Grexit" after all? 
The discussion of "Grexit" should be 
conducted in a non-dogmatic way. There 
are positive examples of the dissolution 
of currency unions (the former Soviet 
Union) and of economic recoveries 
after devaluations (Iceland). But leaving 
the euro would be a road paved with 
many unknowns, and the economy 
would be paralyzed again during the 
transition period. A "Grexit" would not 
be possible against the will of the Greek 
people anyway. The opposition to the 
re-introduction of the drachma even by 
the tourism industry, which might be one 
of the winners from devaluation, speaks 
volumes. By the way, Greece's export 
base may well not be broad enough to 
benefit from devaluation. 
The United Kingdom and the United 
States are very down on "Grexit" and the 
Brussels compromise. 
Surprising, isn't it? They have long 
identified Greece's membership as one 
of the Eurozone's biggest flaws so why 
should "Grexit" now suddenly pose a 
major threat? I am less surprised that 
these two countries now desire a more 
relaxed approach towards Greece. They 
have only a minor financial stake in the 
Greek rescue arid have themselves carried 
current-account deficits over many years. 
Are Greece's economic data proof of the 
failure of all programs so far? 
Over many years, the Greek economy has 
resembled a foundering ship with many 
Past performance is not indicative of future returns. It is not possible to invest directly

back the amount originally invested at any point in time.
