Syrian activists an= Western officials say the militants appear to be making little headway in=recruiting supporters 
within the ranks of the still largely secular protest movement= <http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/fears-of-
extremism-ta=ing-hold-in-syria-as-violence-continues/2012/04/22/gIOA8ClnaT_print.html> whose unifying goal is the 
ouster of the regime led by President Bashar al=Assad. 
But if the United N=tions' peace plan fails to end the government's bloody crackdown 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/scores-killed-in-syri=n-offensive/2011/07/31/gIOAaGuhll_gallery.html> and 
promises of Western and Ara= help for the rebel Free Syrian Army do not materialize, activists and ana=ysts say, there is 
a real risk that frustrated members of the opposition w=ll be driven toward extremism, adding a dangerous dimension 
to a revolt that is threatening to destabilize a wid= arc of territory across the Middle East. 
"The world doing =othing opens the door for jihadis," said Lt. Abdullah al-Awdi, a Free Sy=ian Army commander who 
defected from the regular army in the summer and wa= interviewed during a visit he made to Turkey. He says that he 
has rebuffed several offers of help from militant =roups in the form of arms and money and that he fears the extremists' 
in=luence will grow. 
"This is not a re=son for the international community to be silent about Syria. It should be=a reason for them to do 
something," Awdi said. 
Flow of jihadis rep=rted 
U.S. officials and =estern diplomats in the region, who spoke on the condition of anonymity be=ause of the sensitivity of 
the subject, say they have seen several indicat=ons that al•Qaeda-like groups are trying to inject themselves into the 
Syrian revolution, although they stress that=the Islamist radicals' impact has been limited. AI-Qaeda leader Ayman 
al=Zawahiri called on "mujaheddin" to head to Syria in support of the reb=ls earlier this year, and Western diplomats are 
convinced that operatives affiliated with al-Qaeda carried out a strin= of bombings in Damascus and Aleppo between 
December and March. 
The diplomats say d=zens of jihadis have been detected crossing the border from Iraq into Syri=, some of them Syrians 
who had previously volunteered to fight in Iraq and=others Iraqi. There may also be other foreign nationals among 
them, reversing the journey they took into Iraq ye=rs ago when jihadis flowed across the border to fight the now-
departed Ame=icans. 
The Syrian governme=t facilitated the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq for many years, and t=ere are widespread 
suspicions that it may be covertly reactivating some of=those networks to discredit the revolutionaries, deter 
international support for the opposition and create conditions under=which the harsh crackdown by authorities will 
appear justified. 
The regime portraye= the uprising as the work of radical Islamists in its earliest days, and t=e reports that extremists are 
surfacing in Syria only play into the offici=l narrative, said Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar. 
"This drip, drip,=drip of extremists across the border . <=pan style="font-size:18.0pr>.. there are signs the regime is 
aiding and abetting it," Shaikh said. "A=d it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy." 
It is also plausibl= that these groups, adherents of a radicalized form of Sunni Islam, have t=rned against their former 
benefactors and are making their way back to Syr=a motivated by religious and sectarian zeal. Although many Syrian 
opposition activists insist that their revoluti=n is not sectarian, a majority of Syrians are Sunnis, while Assad, along w=th 
most leading figures in the regime and in the security forces, belongs =o the Shiite-affiliated Alawite minority, lending a 
sectarian dimension to the populist revolt.
