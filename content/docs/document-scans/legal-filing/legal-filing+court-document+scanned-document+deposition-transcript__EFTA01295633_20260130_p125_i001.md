2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
v. Gerard, 90 Wn. App. 169, 949 P.2d 412, 417 (1998) ("Our courts have consistently held 
that an assignee's rights are coextensive with r14] those of the assignor at the time of 
assignment."). And to the extent Green Tree's actions subsequent to the assignment 
violate those modified terms, Green Tree is a proper defendant to a claim for breach of 
contract. 
Additionally, contrary to Green Tree's assertion, the fact that Freddie Mac owns the 
underlying loan does not mean "there is no contract of any kind between Green Tree and 
[Mr. Steadman]." (See Reply at 8.) Certain rights and obligations under that loan--most 
pertinently, the rights to collect Mr. Steadman's monthly payments and, in the event of 
default, to accelerate the loan and initiate foreclosure on Mr. Steadman's property, as—
have been assigned to Green Tree. (See Assignment; Box Decl. Ex. 2 (declaration by 
Green Tree under penalty of perjury that it holds the promissory note evidencing Mr. 
Steadman's loan).) As such, Mr. Steadman is contractually obligated to make monthly 
payments to Green Tree--and Green Tree is contractually obligated to collect those 
payments--in accordance with the terms of the Note and Deed of Trust. (See Note 116 
(requiring Mr. Steadman to remit monthly payments to the note holder and authorizing the 
note holder to accelerate the amount due if r15] a payment is missed), ¶ 8 (obligating Mr. 
Steadman to "keep all of the promises made in this Note"), ¶ 10; Deed of Trust 1122 
(permitting the lender to foreclose in the event of a default); (Ford Decl. Ex. 2 at 104-05 
(notice of default identifying Green Tree as the "creditor' and stating that, if Mr. Steadman 
failed to cure his default, the "creditor' could exercise remedies due under the loan 
agreement, including foreclosure).) Green Tree--not BoA or Freddie Mac--is the entity that 
allegedly foreclosed on Mr. Steadman's property in violation of the modified loan terms. 
Green Tree--not BoA or Freddie Mac--has allegedly violated the servicing obligations as 
set forth in the Note and Deed of Trust. Because Mr. Steadman is suing Green Tree for 
violations of Green Tree's servicing obligations as set forth under the Note and Deed of 
Trust, Green Tree is a proper defendant to Mr. Steadman's breach of contract and duty of 
good faith claims. 
C. Breach of Contract 
Mr. Steadman contends that he entered into a loan modification agreement with BoA 
before his loan was assigned to Green Tree, and that Green Tree's subsequent initiation of 
foreclosure proceedings violated the modified terms of his loan. ris] Green Tree raises 
two arguments in response: (1) no valid modification agreement exists because Mr. 
Steadman cannot prove that he accepted BoA's offer, and (2) the alleged modification 
agreement is barred by the Statute of Frauds. 
1. Acceptance 
A valid contract requires an offer, acceptance and consideration. See Yakima Cnty. Fire 
Protection Dist. No. 12 (West Valley) v. Yakima, 122 Wn.2d 371, 858 P.2d 245 (Wash. 
1993). Acceptance of an offer must be identical to the offer or no contract is formed. Sea-
Van lnvs. Assocs. v. Hamilton, 125 Wn.2d 120, 881 P.2d 1035 (Wash. 1994). Therefore, 
where the offeror specifies the manner of acceptance, no contract is formed if the 
specification is not followed. See Nw Props. Agency, Inc., v. McGhee, 1 Wn. App. 305, 462 
P.2d 249, 253 (1969); Corbit v. J. I. Case Co., 70 Wn.2d 522, 424 P.2d 290, 299 (Wash.
