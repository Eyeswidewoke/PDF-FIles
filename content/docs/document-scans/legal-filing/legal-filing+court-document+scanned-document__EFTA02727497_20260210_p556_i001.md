2. Ordering and Shipment of Replacement Components — To obtain a Replacement 
Component for a scheduled exchange requirement, Customer must issue a purchase order to 
Sikorsky a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the requested delivery date. 
Purchase orders received by Sikorsky within less than one hundred twenty (120) days of the 
requested delivery date may be subject to additional delays. Each purchase order shall state 
shipping instructions and a requested delivery date. 
Sikorsky will ship Replacement 
Components to Customer at Customer's expense, FCA Sikorsky's designated facility 
(Incotenns 2010). Sikorsky and Customer expressly agree that any additional terms and 
conditions set forth in Customer's purchase order shall have no effect and that the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement shall govern all purchase orders issued by Customer to Sikorsky 
hereunder. 
In the case of an unscheduled exchange requirement, Sikorsky shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Replacement Component as soon as possible. 
3. Exchange/Return of Non-Operational Component - Customer shall, at its own expense, 
return the Non-Operational Component to Sikorsky within thirty (30) days of Sikorsky's 
shipment of the Replacement Component and shall provide documentation to Sikorsky to 
confirm return shipment details. If Customer fails to provide documentation that the shipment 
of a Non-Operational Component has been initiated within such time period, Customer shall 
pay to Sikorsky a late return fee of one hundred sixty dollars ($160.00USD) per Component, 
per day in excess of the thirty (30) day return period. If Sikorsky has not received a Non-
Operational Component within six (6) months from the date of Sikorsky's shipment of the 
Replacement Component, then Customer shall pay to Sikorsky the price for the Replacement 
Component as listed in Sikorsky's CPL (the "Non-Return Fee"). Should Sikorsky subsequently 
receive the Non-Operational Component, Sikorsky shall credit to Customer's account an 
amount equal to ninety percent (90%) of the Non-Return Fee. The Non-Operational 
Component should be packed in the same container(s) (or Sikorsky-approved equivalent) in 
which the Replacement Component was received. Customer shall be responsible for any 
additional repair costs due to damage associated with an improperly packaged Non-
Operational Component and/or any damage caused by Customer at the time of removal of the 
Non-Operational Component. Customer shall provide Sikorsky with a copy of the Non-
Operational Component log card prior to shipment, and shall include the original log card in 
the return container with the Non-Operational Component. Customer shall also retain a copy 
of the Non-Operational Component log card. 
4. Title Transfer/Risk of Loss - Title and risk of loss for each Replacement Component supplied 
to Customer under this Agreement shall be deemed to have been transferred to Customer upon 
shipment from Sikorsky's facility. Title and risk of loss for each Non-Operational Component 
shall be deemed to have been transferred to Sikorsky upon delivery to Sikorsky's facility. 
Customer represents and warrants that, at the time title to any Non-Operational Component is 
transferred to Sikorsky (thereby constituting a sale), Customer will have full power, authority 
and legal right to sell such Non-Operational Component to Sikorsky, and such Non-
Operational Component will be free and clear of any liens, charges and encumbrances created 
by or against Customer or arising out of the ownership, possession, operation or use of such 
Non-Operational Component. Customer hereby indemnifies and holds Sikorsky harmless 
from any breach of the foregoing representation and warranty.
