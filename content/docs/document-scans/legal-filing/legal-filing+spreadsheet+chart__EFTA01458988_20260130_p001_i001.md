World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Commodities: Supply adjustment is well underway for oil. 
not so for the metals 
By next year, we expect that OPEC will have engineered one of the 
sharpest historical declines in US production. A modelled contraction of at 
least 650 kb/d would be comparable with the 600 kb/d fall in 1989 which 
occurred in the context of an extended supply slowdown beginning after 
prices fell in 1986. 
• 
Our modelling indicates that while the first half of next year will remain 
oversupplied and risks remain to the downside during this period, the 
steady contraction of US supply along with trend rates of demand growth 
will lead to a more normalised market balance in 2017. 
• 
We believe that the current recovery period in oil prices will be one of the 
slowest and most extended on record, owing partly to further growth in 
OPEC supply to 2017 when modelled OPEC production of 32.4 mmb/d 
matches our calculated call on OPEC (i.e., the volume required from OPEC 
to balance demand). 
• 
Oil at a Brent price of USD45/bbl is below the 2016 national budget 
breakeven level for all of the ten countries assessed by our EMEA macro 
team, and also below the breakevens for fourteen countries assessed by 
the IMF apart from Turkmenistan (with a breakeven of USD42.7/bbl). 
• 
However, budget breakevens may continue to fall as a result of coping 
strategies in the form of spending cuts and currency devaluation while 
government bond issuance and asset sales help to fund deficits, thus 
making another year of low prices survivable. 
• 
We maintain our bearish outlook for gold. We believe the first step in US 
policy normalisation will now more likely than not take place this month. 
Moreover, further tightening in 2016 is long overdue and a full pricing-in of 
this risk has yet to unfold. Additionally, further 6% strength in the trade-
weighted US dollar confirms the downside scenario for gold. 
• 
For industrial metals, the barriers to exit in many markets are high. These 
barriers range from the need to cover high fixed cost bases, take-or-pay 
supply contracts; pressure and incentives from governments to maintain 
employment and balance current accounts to a struggle for survival. 
• 
The metals industry still has to adjust to structurally lower Chinese demand 
while long gestation projects continue to add tonnes to the market. While 
we see supply cuts gathering momentum in 2016, we only expect price 
stabilisation in 2017 when the markets start to look more balanced. 
Oil fundamentals have bottomed; have prices? 
Our view is that market balances have seen their weakest period and that a 
slow and steady process of US supply curtailment is well underway. We have 
already seen a 440 kb/d decline in the US since July, although this was 
preceded and overshadowed by an OPEC increase of 1,400 kb/d between 
November 2014 and June 2015. 
Gradual improvement towards a more balanced market in 2017 is likely even 
with the onset of incremental Iranian exports next year. Further declines in the 
US will offset the Iranian ramp-up, while underlying demand growth of 1.2 
mmb/d will take up the slack of excess Saudi and Iraqi volumes. 
Even if it is true that balances have seen the worst, market balances should 
remain weak for virtually the entire next year. Surpluses are most evident in 
the first half with an excess of +830 kb/d. Inventories will likely build once 
again over this period while we model the second half surplus at +177 kb/d.
