AGP LP 519 Alpha Group Caudal Paul Barrett 
Trades among all accounts or among different funds that employ the same strategy may be 
allocated on other than a pro-rata basis if the number of shares executed at a given price is 
deemed too small to warrant allocation among all funds. In such cases, Alkeon may allocate the 
order to those client accounts that can receive their full allocations from the partial execution, 
rather than allocating such execution among all funds. Alkeon will enter the balance of the order 
with another broker and will allocate those trades to remaining funds. 
Generally when the portfolio manager determines it is an appropriate investment for a client or 
strategy, Alkeon will implement its initial public offering ("IPO") allocation procedures. These 
investments are allocated pro-rata to eligible investors within a strategy, which may cause 
performance variations among different funds in the same strategy. Certain funds or clients may 
not participate in IPO allocations due to restrictions, guidelines, suitability, client direction, cash 
availability, pending cash additions or withdrawals, portfolio market exposure, sector exposures, 
or position sizes, among others. 
It may not always be possible or consistent with the investment objectives of Alkeon's various 
funds for the same investment positions to be taken or liquidated at the same time. Accordingly, 
from time to time Alkeon may purchase a given security for one or more funds on the same day 
as Alkeon sells or sells short the same security for other funds. Certain positions and position 
sizes can vary between funds that employ different or the same strategy which may cause 
performance variations among different funds in the same strategy. 
In the course of trading for the funds that Alkeon manages, a number of potential situations 
could occur, including orders given at different times by different portfolio managers, two 
portfolio managers may want to buy or sell at the same time, one portfolio manager may begin a 
trade and a second portfolio manager may want to execute the same trade before the first trade is 
complete, one portfolio manager may want to buy while another portfolio manager may want to 
sell or sell short at the same time, one portfolio manager may want to sell long while another 
portfolio manager may want to sell short at the same time, one portfolio manager may want to 
buy or sell for more than one fund or strategy, a portfolio manager could buy or sell for one fund 
or strategy on a specific day and buy or sell the same security for another fund or strategy on 
subsequent days, among others. In each instance, Alkeon has outlined allocation procedures to 
deal with the different scenarios that may arise. Other scenarios that may occur are handled on 
an ad hoc basis by the CCO. 
From time to time, Alkeon may trade the same security on the same day for different funds 
within the same strategy at prices that are not identical. This will usually occur as a result of 
capital inflows or withdrawals. Any rebalancing of funds is done at the discretion of Alkeon and 
may result in performance variations among different funds in the same strategy. 
Item 13. 
Review of Accounts 
Each account (other than the Global Alpha funds) receives ongoing and continuous investment 
management and will be subject to supervisory review by Mr. Panayotis Sparaggis, Alkeon's 
Managing Member. Mr. Sparaggis and Steven M. Ahn are the co-portfolio managers for the 
Global Alpha funds. Matters generally reviewed include adherence to guidelines established by 
Alkeon relating to specific securities held and adherence to client-established guidelines.
