Except under the limited circumstances described below, purchasers of debentures will not be entitled to 
have debentures registered in their names and will not receive physical delivery of debentures. Accordingly, each 
beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of DTC and its participants to exercise any rights under the 
debentures and the indenture. 
The laws of some jurisdictions may require that some purchasers of securities take physical delivery of 
securities in definitive form. Those laws may impair the ability to transfer or pledge beneficial interests in 
debentures. 
Distributions on the debentures held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of its 
customers in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for 
Clearstream. Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the 
Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear 
System, and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the "Euroclear Terms and Conditions"). The Euroclear Terms 
and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash front 
Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on 
a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear 
Operator acts under the Euroclear Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants and has no 
record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants. 
Distributions on the debentures held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of 
its participants in accordance with the Euroclear Terms and Conditions, to the extent received by the U.S. 
depositary for Euroclear. 
Initial settlement for the debentures will be made in immediately available funds. Secondary market trading 
between DTC participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in 
immediately available funds. Secondary market trading between Clearstream customers and/or Euroclear 
participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of 
Clearstream and Euroclear and will be settled using the procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in 
immediately available funds. No assurances can be given as to the effect, if any, of settlement in immediately 
available funds on trading activity in the debentures. 
Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC. on the one hand, and 
directly or indirectly through Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, on the other, will be effected in 
DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by the U.S. 
depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European 
international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and 
within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will, if the 
transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the U.S. depositary to take action to effect 
final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving the debentures in DTC, and making or receiving payment 
in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream customers 
and Euroclear participants may not deliver instructions directly to their U.S. depositaries. 
Because of time-zone differences, credits of the debentures received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result 
of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and will 
be credited the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions in the 
debentures settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream customers or Euroclear 
participants on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales of the debentures 
by or through a Clearstream customer or a Euroclear participant to a DTC participant will be received with value 
on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of 
the business day following settlement in DTC.
