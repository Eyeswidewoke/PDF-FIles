GLOUSI 44 Glenn Warren 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV. LP 
Appendix 3 Anti-Money Laundering 
GENERAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING CONSIDERATIONS 
The Manager takes seriously its responsibility to prevent the Fund from being used for money laundering or other illicit 
purposes. To comply with anti-money laundering laws, the Manager or any designee thereof may require a detailed 
verification of the identity and residence of each Investor (and each person who holds a beneficial interest in each 
Investor) and the source of the payment of the investment. Each of the Manager or its designee reserves the right to 
request such information as it considers necessary to verify the identity of any Investor (and each person who holds a 
beneficial interest in each Investor) and may also independently obtain such information. In the event of delay or failure 
by any Investor to produce any information required for verification purposes, the Manager or its designee may refuse to 
accept such Investors subscription for an Interest, and any funds received will be retumed to the account from which 
such funds were sent (unless such return is, in the judgment of the Manager or its designee, contrary to applicable law. 
regulation or the instructions of law enforcement officials, in which case the funds may be blocked or retained). If the 
Manager or its designee has a suspicion obtained in the course of business that any person is engaged in money 
laundering or other illegal activity, the Manager must. notwithstanding any obligations of confidentiality that might 
otherwise apply. report such suspicion to the appropriate authorities pursuant to applicable law. 
ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION 
In order to comply with applicable anti-money laundering legislation, the Manager has an obligation to ask each Investor 
questions regarding its identity, address, source of funds and, if necessary, legal representatives, authorized signatories, 
beneficial owners or control structures and to collect requisite documentation to substantiate the information. Also, 
enhanced anti-money laundering regulations require that should any of the above personal or institutional information 
change. such clients must immediately notify the Manager of the change(s) and provide the Manager with relevant 
documentation to verify these changes. 
ECONOMIC SANCTION REGULATIONS 
Each Investor will be required to make representations and warranties to the Manager that, among other things, the 
Interests to be purchased by the Investor will not be held by, or for the benefit of. any person currently subject to UK 
sanctions, UN sanctions. EU sanctions, and/or U.S. sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the 
U.S. Treasury Department (collectively, the -Sanction Regulations"). The Manager and its designee may undertake 
their own efforts to verify the accuracy of any Investor's representations and warranties and, so long as an Investor holds 
an Interest, may seek to verify that neither the Investor nor any person holding a beneficial interest in the Investor is 
subject to any then-applicable Sanction Regulations. 
The Manager also may be required in the future to obtain 
additional disclosures from an Investor (and each of the beneficial owners of such Investor) to comply with the Sanction 
Regulations. If the Manager or its designee determines that an Investor or a person holding a beneficial interest in an 
Investor is subject to any of the Sanction Regulations. the Manager may be obligated by law to block and retain an 
Investor's investment.
