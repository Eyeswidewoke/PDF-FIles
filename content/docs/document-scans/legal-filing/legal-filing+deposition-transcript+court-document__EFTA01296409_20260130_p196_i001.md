2014-Ohio-2787, *; 2014 Ohio App. LEXIS 2729, te 
[`P1] Defendant-appellant, Baltazar J. Altunar, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin 
County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion to withdraw guilty plea. For the 
following reasons, we affirm that judgment. 
I. Factual and Procedural Background 
[' P2] On May 11, 2009, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted appellant with six counts 
of aggravated vehicular assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.08, and two counts of operating a 
vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, in violation of R.C. 4511.19. 
Appellant initially entered a not guilty plea. Subsequently, however, appellant withdrew that 
plea and entered a guilty plea to three counts of aggravated vehicular assault. The trial 
court accepted appellant's guilty plea, found him guilty, and sentenced him accordingly. 
Appellant did not appeal his conviction or sentence. 
[" P3] Two years later, appellant filed in the trial court, pursuant to R.C. 2943.031, a 
motion to [.2] withdraw his guilty plea. Appellant is a Mexican national who, at the time of 
the offense, was living in the United States. He argued that the trial court did not advise 
him of the consequences a guilty plea could have on his status in this country as required 
by R.C. 2943.031. The trial court denied appellant's motion, construing it as a motion to 
withdraw pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1 and concluding that he failed to demonstrate a manifest 
injustice to warrant withdrawal under that rule. 
II. The Appeal 
['IN] Appellant appeals and assigns the following errors': 
I. The trial court erred as a matter of law in applying the "manifest injustice" requirement of Ohio criminal rule 32.1 to a 
motion to withdraw gtilty plea filed pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 2943.031 
II. The trial coat erred as a matter of law in refusing to comply with the mandatory language set forth in Ohio Revised 
Code 2943.031. where appellant made the showing that he is not a U.S. citizen and he was never advised of the fact 
that deportation was a consequence of the guilty plea by the court or counsel. 
1 Appellant apparently obtained counsel in order to file a reply brief in this appeal. To the extent that counsel raises additional 
(**3] issues in that reply brief that had not been previously raised by either appellant or the state. we decline to address them. 
Hanlin-Rainaldi Constr. Corp. v. Jeopersf, Inc.. 10th Dist. No. 03AP-851. 2004-Ohio-6250, ¶ 22 Capital One Bank (USA). NA 
v. Gordon. 8th Dist. No. 98953. 2013-Ohio-2095.1 9. 
["P5] Because appellant's assignments of error both concern the trial court's denial of his 
motion to withdraw, we will address them together. 
A. Appellant Filed a Motion to Withdraw Pursuant to R.C. 2943.031 
[" P6] Appellant first contends that the trial court improperly analyzed his motion to 
withdraw as one filed under Crim.R. 32.1. We agree. 
[' P7] IHN1] Although they seek the same result, motions to withdraw under Crim.R. 32.1 
and R.C. 2943.031 are separate and distinct. A motion to withdraw a guilty plea filed under 
Crim.R. 32.1 requires a demonstration of manifest injustice in order to warrant withdrawal
