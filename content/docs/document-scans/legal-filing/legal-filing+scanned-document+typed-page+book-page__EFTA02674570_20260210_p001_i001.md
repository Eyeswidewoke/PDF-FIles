Iraq on the brink, again 
By Ryan Crocker 
Ryan Crocker was ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009. He is the Kissinger Senior Fellow at Yale 
University's Jackson institute. 
The situation in Iraq has taken a very dangerous turn. Events there in recent days are reminiscent of those 
that led to virtual civil war in 2006 and resulted in the need for a surge in U.S. troop levels, a new strategy 
and very heavy fighting. Indeed, the places where the violence has erupted are eerily familiar, as many 
were strongholds of al-Qaeda in Iraq at the outset of the surge, before the spread of the Awakening 
movement that fostered reconciliation between disaffected Sunni Arabs and the Shiite-led government in 
Baghdad. The recent events come on top of increasing incidents of horrific attacks by al-Qaeda in Iraq, 
with last month seeing the largest losses in years — and they take place against a backdrop of 
increasingly serious political discord. These developments clearly require the attention and support of the 
international community, led by the United States. 
Progress toward political accord and pluralism first came to Iraq in 2007 and 2008 when, as security 
spread during the surge. Sunni and Shiite leaders opted to resolve their differences through 
accommodation rather than through violence. Their commitment survived the difficult aftermath of the 
2010 parliamentary elections, in which no one party won a clear mandate. It survived last year's arrest of 
the bodyguards of Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi on charges of terrorism, as well as his 
subsequent trial in absentia and death sentence. 
And although domestic political issues galvanized Sunni areas of the country over the past four months, 
both the Iraqi Security Forces and the protesters exercised considerable restraint. Sunni leaders took 
concrete steps to keep demonstrations peaceful by searching protesters for weapons. Even after eight 
Sunni protesters were killed in Fallujah in January, both sides managed to de-escalate. 
That all changed last week. It began in the town of Hawija, near Kirkuk, where Iraqi Security Forces said 
Sunni protesters were harboring insurgents who had killed soldiers at a government checkpoint. The 
protesters denied there were any insurgents in their camp and failed to turn over any individuals. On April 
23, the security forces launched an action in the camp — and a violent clash ensued, leaving scores dead 
and injured. Now Sunni Arab sheikhs who had been urging restraint are calling for war. Some reports say 
that the tribes are gathering former insurgents and preparing to fight. Violent incidents have already taken 
place, with more than 40 people killed in one day in Mosul alone. 
This has the gravest implications for Iraq's security and stability. Al-Qaeda in Iraq has already begun to 
reestablish itself in areas that Iraqi and U.S. forces cleared at enormous cost over the past five years. And 
Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda in Iraq's front group in Syria. is attempting to hijack the secular resistance to 
Syrian President Bashar al•Assad. These developments threaten not only to unravel the gains made since
