Householding of Statements and Other Communications 
As a convenience to you, we may consolidate periodic communications for certain 
accounts with the same address. This practice, called "householding," applies to account 
statements, trade confirmations, personal and financial information required to be sent by 
regulation, preliminary and final prospectuses and Summary of Accounts statements, 
which provide consolidated information for all of the accounts in your household. 
Households are determined as follows: 
• 
Accounts that share the same name, address and Social Security or Tax ID 
Number are automatically placed in the same household. 
• 
Accounts that share only the same address will be placed in the same household 
only with the express consent of all the Account holders. 
We mail househeld communications in a single envelope (if you receive paper delivery) or, 
if you receive electronic delivery, we make them available through UBS Online Services or 
other electronic delivery method. Any member of your household who is enrolled in UBS 
Online Services can have access to view all Accounts in the household. 
The composition of a household will change as clients move away from the household 
mailing address, and the addressee for househeld mailings may also change over time. 
Where owners of joint accounts live at different addresses, househeld mailings will be sent 
to at least one account owner's address and may be included with mailings for other 
accounts at that address under the conditions described above. 
Periodically we are required by industry regulators to send records of certain 
personal and financial information to our clients. Because we deliver these records 
with your account statements, other members of your household may have access to these 
records unless you instruct us to send them to you separately. 
If you do not want your statements and other periodic communications from us to be 
bundled by household, please contact your Financial Advisor and ask to receive individual 
mailings in separate envelopes or delivered separately via electronic means. 
E-mail Communications 
We discourage clients from transmitting personal or confidential information through 
e-mail. If you choose to send personal and confidential information to us via e-mail, we 
cannot be responsible for any loss or damages that occur as a result, such as losses or 
damages arising from mistaken identity or unauthorized access and the use of the 
information (for any purpose) by others who may intercept or otherwise access the 
communications during and after transmission.
