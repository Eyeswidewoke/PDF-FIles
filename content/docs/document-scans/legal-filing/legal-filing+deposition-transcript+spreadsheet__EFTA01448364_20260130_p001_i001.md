Cash Flow: 3200-$300MWyear derived predominantly from Apollo distributions based on Black's ownership of 92.7MM 
units ($360MM on 2012 1040 as advised by Epstein). Here is a look at historical distributions, along with estimated 
distributions through 2015 for Black.

Risks/Mitigants: 
Assuming $2.58N in Total Liabilities and assuming a 3% all4n interest rate, MO DS would be $75MM. 
Distribution Estimates are based on Credit Suisse Research Report with all other research reports in line 
with those projections. 
Risks: 
• 
Black's ability to "top-up" in the event of margin calls. 
• 
Black's reliance on the sale of assets to repay the total $1.5BN in Bank debt. 
• 
Increased Debt level and encumbered assets. 
Mitigants:.
• 
Current Liquidity: Per our conversation with Epstein. Black currently has $150MM in cash (checking account at US 
Trust) and typically maintains no less than $100MM at any point in time. This cash could be used to "top-up" any margin 
calls. We would covenant to a certain level of unencumbered assets. Such covenants could include an unencumbered 
liquidity covenant (of $100MM) and/or an unencumbered asset covenant. 
• 
Debt Restriction: We would propose a covenant such that all other debt, including up to $1.0BN N/P to the Family Trust 
be subordinated to DB's debt 
• 
Strong Cash Flow: Assuming Black receives $250MWyr in distributions, and assuming 50% is for taxes/living expenses. 
this leaves him $125MM. With estimated I/O DS of $75MM, he would have an extra $50MWyear that could be applied to 
reduce debt. Quarterly recurring cash flow from his AGO interest is projected to remain strong. There is also the possibility 
of a large tax receivable payment by APO upon conversion of AGO units. 
• 
Uncorrelated Collateral: Black's two largest assets (Art 8 Apollo), and hence our collateral pool, is uncorrelated. 
Additionally, the mix between this collateral pool is governed by covenants that 1) the Art collateral will be limited to no 
more than 70% of the Borrowing Base, and 2) the Apollo collateral will be limited to no more than 50% of the Borrowing 
Base. 
• 
The Family Trusts may also be a source of liquidity should he need to borrow from them to repay bank debt.
