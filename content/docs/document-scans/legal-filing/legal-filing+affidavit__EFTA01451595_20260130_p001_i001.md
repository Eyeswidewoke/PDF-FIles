SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Section 7: Summary of Terms and Conditions 
Secondary Opportunities Fund III. LP 
Default 
A Limited Partner that defaults in respect of its obligation to make Advances or other 
contributions to the Fund will be subject to customary default provisions, including forfeiture of 
a substantial portion of its Interest, and payment of interest on the defaulted amount at a rate 
equal to the higher of (i) three-month USD LIBOR plus 2% and (ii) 8%. 
Term 
The term of the Fund will be 7 years from the Final Admission Date, subject to up to five 
consecutive additional one-year extensions as determined by the Manager. 
Currency 
The Fund will be denominated in US dollars. 
Tax Considerations 
The Manager intends that the Fund be treated as a partnership for US federal income tax 
purposes. As a partnership, the Fund generally will not be subject to US federal income tax. 
and each Partner subject to US tax will be required to include in computing its US federal 
income tax liability its allocable share of the items of income. gain, loss. deduction and credit 
of the Fund, regardless of whether and to what extent distributions are made by the Fund to 
such Partner. See Section 10: Certain Legal, ERISA and Tax Considerations — Certain Tax 
Considerations of this Memorandum. It is expected that annual US federal tax information 
from portfolio investments will not be received in sufficient time to permit the Fund to 
incorporate such information into its annual US federal tax information and to distribute such 
information to its investors prior to April 15 each year. As a result. investors will likely be 
required to obtain extensions for filing US federal, state and local income tax retums each 
year. 
The taxation of partners and partnerships is extremely complex. 
Investors, in 
particular non-US and US tax-exempt Investors, are strongly urged to consult their 
own tax advisers concerning the tax consequences of making an investment in the 
Fund, in light of their particular circumstances. 
IRS Circular 230 Disclosure: This summary was not intended or written to be used, and it 
cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed 
on the taxpayer under US federal tax law. 
This summary was written to support the 
promotion or marketing of the Fund. Each taxpayer should seek advice based on the 
taxpayer's particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor. 
ERISA Considerations 
Investment in the Fund is generally open to institutions, including pension plans, subject to 
the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). The 
General Partner will use its reasonable best efforts to conduct the affairs and operations of 
the Fund so as to limit investment in the Fund by 'benefit plan investors" (within the meaning 
of Department of Labor regulations as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA) to less than 25% 
of each class of equity interests in the Fund. See Section 10: Certain Legal, ERISA and Tax 
Considerations — Certain Tax Considerations of this Memorandum. 
Each prospective investor subject to ERISA is urged to consult its own advisers as to 
the provisions of ERISA applicable to an investment in the Fund.
