Egypt divided= a reading into a crisscrossed map 
Hani Shukrallah 
8 Nov 2012 -- Trium=hant revolutions tend to unite the majority of the population. Not so stal=ed revolutions. Nearly 
two years after the great 18-day popular uprising, =gypt is a deeply divided nation 
The Egyptian revolu=ion blew the top off a deeply divided society. It did much more, as its cr=ators recreated 
themselves, the few thousands became hundreds of thousands= and a nation in which political space had all but 
withered away, found itself politicized in ways and to such a =egree, unprecedented for generations, possibly since the 
birth of politics=on the banks of the Nile in themid-to-late 19th century. 
Yet, if anything, the revolution sharpened the schisms already extant in Eg=ptian society, which had been blunted, 
controlled, manipulated and hidden =way under the all encompassing lid of the Mubarak police state, held tight=y and 
seemingly incontrovertibly for 30 years via the twin instruments of unbridled repression and wide-ran=ing clientism. 
The revolution did so even as it gave birth to new, massive and profound cl=avages which not only created new battle 
lines, but redrew all of the old =nes. 
Revolutions, by definition, are never made by the whole people; rather by a=critical mass of the most aware, most 
courageous, and most socially and po=itically conscious members of the society. To succeed at all they need to =ecure 
the sympathy, and/or neutrality of a considerable majority of the people. 
The Egyptian revolution easily fulfilled these two conditions. An estimated=seven million out of Egypt's population of 
82.5 million (a critical mass=by any criteria) took an active part in the revolution, while, as Brooking= Institution scholar 
H.A. Hellyer indicated in an article on Ahram Online not long ago, Gallup polls taken m=ltiple times during 2011 showed 
8 out of 10 Egyptians supported the revolu=ion. 
The Egyptian revolution, nevertheless, was largely an urban phenomenon, not=so much different in this respect from 
the seminal revolution of modern hi=tory, the great French Revolution of 1789. Rural Egypt, which accounts for=some 
42% of the population, stood for the most part on the sidelines during the heroic 18 days of January/Fe=ruary 2011. 
Triumphant revolutions, by virtue of their seizure of state power, tend to =ull the stragglers along, which in turn enables 
them to offer the languid =easantry a share of the fruits of revolution, freeing them (to this or tha= extent) from the 
yoke of the big landowners, and giving them greater access to what peasants everywhere mos= desire, ownership, real 
or de facto, of the land they till. (The French R=volution gave them as well, revolutionary war, foreign conquest, 
including=not least, Egypt, and for a period, empire.) Not so, a revolution hijacked: First by the military, soon after by a 
milit=ry-Muslim Brotherhood alliance, briefly by the military on its own, and fi=ally by a Muslim Brotherhood-military 
alliance The results of the first round of presidential elections in post-revolution=Egypt are remarkably revealing of the 
urban-rural divide, as of many other=features of the nation's political map — in so far as they provided us=with our first 
sense of the real configuration of forces, leanings and inclinations in the country. 
Overall, the revolution won the great cities of the country while rural Egy=t was split — literally down the middle —
between the military's fol=ul (Mubarak regime remnant) candidate, Ahmed Shafiq, and the Muslim Brothe=hood's 
Mohamed Morsi. 
Non-Islamist revolutionary candidate Hamdeen Sabbahi easily won Cairo, Grea=er Cairo, Alexandria, and came well 
ahead in the combined vote of the nati=n's coastal cities. If we add his vote to that of the other main revolut=onary 
candidate, democratic Islamist Abdel-Monem Aboul-Fotouh, we are faced with a landslide victory for the re=olutionary 
vote in all these regions, accounting for over 40 percent of th= total national vote, compared to 25 percent for Morsi and 
23 for Shafiq. 
The countryside, including a great many provincial towns went the other way= So glaring was the urban-rural electoral 
divide that Palestinian politica= writer Azmi Bishara commented in a tweet at the time, describing the Egyp=ian elections 
as evidencing "classical political sociology", with the great urban centres going for the revolut=on, while the countryside 
continued to be held in the grip of both religio= and the state.
