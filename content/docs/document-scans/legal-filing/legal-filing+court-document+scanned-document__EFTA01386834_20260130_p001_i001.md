the intended Refinancing. The Co-Issuers have not issued securities prior to the date of this Memorandum and have not 
listed any securities on any exchange. The Issuer will not undertake any activities other than entering into the Initial Facility 
and the intended Refinancing, making payments or distributions on the Initial Facility and Preferred Shares, issuing any 
additional debt or Preferred Shares pursuant to the Transaction Agreements, performing its other obligations under the 
Transaction Agreements to which the Issuer is a party, executing a Refinancing and other activities incidental thereto,

entering into amendments to (or replacements of) the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and other activities 
incidental thereto. 
The Co-Issuer shall not engage in any business or activity other than executing a Refinancing and other activities 
incidental thereto, including entering into amendments to (or replacements of) the Initial Facility, the intended Refinancing 
and the other Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and other activities incidental thereto. Neither of the Co-Issuers

market conditions and the need (in the judgment of the Portfolio Advisor) to satisfy the Coverage Tests, the Concentration 
Limitations and the Collateral Quality Tests or to obtain funds for the redemption or payment of the Facilities, the Issuer will 
own its Assets and will receive payments of interest and principal on the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments as 
the principal source of its income. The ability to purchase additional Collateral Obligations and sell Collateral Obligations 
prior to maturity is subject to significant restrictions under the Initial Facility and will be subject to similar restrictions under 
the Refinancing. See Section 11, "Summary of Principal Terms". 
Administration 
MaplesFS Limited acts as the administrator of the Issuer (in such capacity, the 'issuer Administrator). The office of 
the Issuer Administrator serves as the general business office of the Issuer. Through such office, and pursuant to the terms 
of an Administration Agreement entered into between the Issuer and the Issuer Administrator (the "Issuer Administration 
Agreement"), the Issuer Administrator performs in the Cayman Islands, or such other jurisdiction as may be agreed by the 
parties from time to time, various management functions on behalf of the Issuer, and provides certain clerical, administrative 
and other services until termination of the Issuer Administration Agreement. The Issuer and the Issuer Administrator entered 
into a registered office agreement (the 'issuer Registered Office Agreement") for the provision of registered office facilities 
to the Issuer. In consideration of the foregoing, the Issuer Administrator will receive various fees payable by the Issuer at 
rates agreed upon from time to time, plus expenses. The terms of the Issuer Administration Agreement and the Issuer 
Registered Office Agreement provide that either the Issuer or the Issuer Administrator may terminate the applicable 
agreements upon the occurrence of certain stated events, including any breach by the other party of its obligations under 
such agreements. In addition, the Issuer Administration Agreement and the Issuer Registered Office Agreement provide that 
either party to the applicable agreement shall be entitled to terminate such agreement by giving at least three months' notice 
in writing to the other party thereto. 
The Issuer Administrator is subject to the overview of the Issuer's Board of Directors. 
The principal office of the Issuer Administrator is PO Box 1093, Boundary Hall, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman, KY1-
