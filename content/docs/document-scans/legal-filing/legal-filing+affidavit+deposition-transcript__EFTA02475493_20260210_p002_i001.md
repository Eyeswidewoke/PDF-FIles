step in or=er to check your financials. "sorry we never got one?" =AO though 9.8 million invested, no p&I, nothing!, a 
const=uction project run amok , no budget, the coo fired after only = months. , no clue . fyi artspace 
=AO As in your words probably your closest friend and in =rder to turn the page. I hope the following to be 
constructive 
=C2 Here is a list of things I think would be in your =nterest to get done asap .but definitely not by me . 
=AO 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use you= trading accounts as they remain a paramount 
requirement 16 mo=ths after i emailed you re their importance. THe =span>Phaidon transaction papered and 
structured as contemplat=d DOES NOT WORK , its as simple as that. DOES NOT !! =AO I suggest again that you re-do 
bank loans. no need t= pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now =o longer trustee. re- do will, 
make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up.=C2 pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid of Judy Black 
trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . revi=w amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more protections in for A=ex and 
Victoria. , distribute some m=ney to kids let them make decisions. , decide art division =AO with children in 
attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fil= out estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick 
bronstein said the only 1040 he ev=r filled out was his own. Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., A 
strategy of the =se of art should be implemented.. you have tax consultants it=consultants. plane operation 
consultant. . boat consultants. a=chitects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation , deal wit= TRA , BRH , r=tionalize 
investments. cash flow. reporting, gaming disclosures. for=ign, gift.. prepare tax projections for 15 and 16, . deal with 
neg basis = tufts gain, debt financed. art partnership, pledges. sell sto=k , art, deal with phaidon debt. athene4=pan>,? 
income , capital , foreign , exit, corporate, insurance regs,=out and inbound issues, basis, appropriate discoun= rates. ? 
terminations. control. , qualified dividends. corpor=te tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, =AO short swing and other sec 
disclosures, I still think you might co=sider a <=pan>Rothshcild bank transaction they have 150 = and a distribution 
network with no products , private bank =AO Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service. deal with UK visa issue soon=r 
rather than later, we can talk about Rowen request re Athene =, complex 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! 
=/div> 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then =gain Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon =payout., then only after weeks, when you delayed 
any detailed =iscussion of money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful resp=nse ( which I fully understand ) . you 
unilaterally changed changed =ur agreement.. Sm would be reserved for the future ? . and ou= of the remaining 15m ,? 
i would receive only a third. ( note = I'm confident that both the debt , and the artspace investment will also lead to a 
write off of another 30 =AO m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said=that i require most people to 
pay their advisory fee up front=C2 so that I am assured that I will be properly compensated for m= work when 
strategies are implemented . you may recall that you =AO appeared offended and said " are you suggesting=that i 
would go back on my word " I said no , of course not ! y=u are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when 
am=unts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for=them to pay 
I included in this letter the =mail i sent to you on April 15, the day i was exam=ning your returns It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation f=r a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just completed.=C2 
though the number was great it was clear. When it appeared tha= the details could now be worked out I was the first 
to say, it is =oo much money, however. 
From day zero I p=oposed to discount to 50 - 60 million the fair price of =he transaction just completed . including 
Phaidon.. though=C2 this amount was already substantially less than ou= agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that=this was out of range. in fact, alternative method= of payment . plane, or an -in-kind payment were 
discussed ( =span>ie including keeping the 30m portion of fee =utstanding till March ) ,I provided as you specifically 
requested =AO a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all do=uments that i was given access to. ( Phaidon 
was not forthcom=ng ) in order to make my many corrections . =1 was then told that Alans involvement warran=ed a 
discount . Even in the best of light , though it is=beyond question that not one time in the three years of his r=tainer 
has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including =AO any wayt to deal with the use issue on debras=death ,or even the 
most basic review of your largest asset by far , =he BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a con=ribution to the plan
