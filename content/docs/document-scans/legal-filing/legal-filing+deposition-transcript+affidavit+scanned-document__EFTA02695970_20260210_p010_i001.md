In terms of a positive reinforcing loop, imagine how good being able to easily pay taxe and fees could be. 
Today compliance is low, not because it is bad to pay, but simply because it is too hard to pay. If time is 
your only asset, then spending a day trekking to an office and waiting on line to pay a monthly 
occupation or business tax/fee is simply prohibitive. If more people pay, then services can improve. 
And if it costs less to pay (fewer offices and manual processes) then more money can go to services. 
What an awesome platform for the government. 
Competition. SomTel is already developing their competitive service. This is as expected. You can also 
expect the remittance firms to feel the pinch as well. So competition will heat up. And when 
competition heats up... 
Interoperability. Remember when ATMs used to not talk to each other. Remember when Cirrus and 
PLUS had to litigate in order to get to work across banks. It is interesting to think about how these 
systems work when two people have different carriers attached to their SIM. I bet cash becomes the 
short-term intermediary. But that starts to look a lot like a $3 ATM fee for a $20 withdrawal. Sigh, but 
the good news is folks are clearly aware of and up to the challenge. 
Regulation. M-Pesa exists in countries that have banks. And those banks are not happy. As you can 
imagine they are doing all the lobbying they can to get the operators to be regulated as though they 
were a bank. This is much more challenging than it appears. First and foremost, they don't really offer 
the key services of a bank which is to take the money deposited and loan it out (which is why, for 
example, micro finance institutions do get pulled into regulatory discussions). This means all the things 
regulations are there to protect, primarily reserves on hand, do not apply. You can bet that the TeleSom 
folks are on top of this. They are particularly sophisticated about this topic even though they have little 
regulatory experience. In our discussions it was clear that some folks have spent time abroad learning. 
For the time being, they are going to be able to avoid being called a bank since there are no banks to 
compete with them. 
One super interesting thing to keep in mind is that all transactions on Zaad happen on the books of 
TeleSom. It is simply moving existing money from one SIM owner to another. The risk is very low and 
the transaction costs effectively zero. That's nothing at all like a bank that takes your money and gives it 
to someone else outside the bank as a loan (or invests it). With no money leaving the system, this is a 
different type of bank. That's why interoperability becomes a challenge—it means companies need to 
trust each other and risk is increased. As long as TeleSom is solvent and does not attempt to profit from 
your "deposits" things are very safe and very cheap. 
Revenue. The other reason regulation is not going to be easy is because TeleSom does not currently 
charge for the service. To me this is the most interesting question. The TeleSom folks are quick to say 
they are all set up to charge and ready to go. This is, after all, what M-Pesa does (and why the service is 
10% of Safaricom's revenue). But this is not such a no-brainer to me. The service does not cost much to 
operate and essentially pays for itself based on the reduced costs of adding minutes (since you already 
have their cash on "deposit"). And it is certainly going to alienate people. It does feel like there is a 
Bank of America moment waiting to happen.
