509 F. Supp. 815, *; 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11119, **; 
1981-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P64,165 
nature of the defendants' business of providing hospital care and services. E. g. Wolfe, 
supra at 687-688. 
It is the Court's opinion that the ["16] proper standard to be used is that illustrated in the 
recent Supreme Court cases, McLain, supra; Rex Hospital, supra, that place the emphasis 
upon the interstate character of the defendants activities in general and not solely the 
alleged conspiratorial acts, thereby precluding dismissal of a complaint before the plaintiff 
has at least been accorded the opportunity of discovering facts in support of his claim. To 
the extent that the cases cited by the defendants apply a contrary standard, the Court 
declines to follow them. 
The Court will determine the substance of plaintiffs antitrust allegations after he has had 
an opportunity to conduct limited discovery into the issues and can prepare an adequate 
response to the other objections raised by the defendants. Defendants will then be 
allowed to renew their remaining objections to the Sherman Act claim in an appropriate 
manner. 
IV. CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS 
(a) § 1983 allegations 
Although 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is relatively simple and straightforward in its language, 
IFIN71 
in order to sustain his claim plaintiff must allege: (1) that the defendants deprived him of 
some right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States; and (2) rin that 
the defendants acted under color of state law. Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 14-4, 
90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); Fadjo v. Coon, 633 F.2d 1172 (5th Cir. 1981); 
Menchaca v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 613 F.2d 507 (5th Cir. 1980). [HN8] Both of these 
elements of a § 1983 action must be alleged and proven before relief can be forthcoming. 
An inspection of the Amended Complaint reveals that plaintiff can prove no set of facts that 
will permit the relief he seeks since he has been deprived of no federal or constitutional 
right. Nor have all of the defendants acted under color of state law. 
6. "Every person wito, under color of any statute, ordinance, regtiation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or 
causes to be subjected. any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any 
rights. privileges. or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liebte to the party injured in an action al law, suit 
in equity. or other proper proceeding for redress." 
[ *18] [822] The defendants' alleged willful and malicious exclusion of the plaintiff from 
the medical staff simply does not constitute a violation of a federal right. Plaintiff has cited 
the Court to no authority supporting the proposition that a podiatrist has a federal right to 
membership on a hospital staff. Nor has the Court independently found any authority to 
support plaintiffs civil rights claims. To the contrary, the Fifth Circuit recently held that a 
podiatrist's constitutional rights went untrammeled when he was denied staff membership 
at a public hospital. Shaw v. Hospital Authority of Cobb County, 614 F.2d 946 (5th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 449 U.S. 955, 101 S. Ct. 362, 66 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1980). 
7. Although this case arose as an action to remedy alleged due process and equal protection violations and was not brought 
pursuer* to the civil rights laws. the Shaw court nonetheless found that Dr. Shaw suffered no violation of a federal right on facts
