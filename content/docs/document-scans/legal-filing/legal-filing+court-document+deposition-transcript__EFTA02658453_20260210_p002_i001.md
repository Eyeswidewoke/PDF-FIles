That said, Noam's characterization of I-language and LOT at the =80 conceptual-intentional" interface, with an 
externalization th=ough generative mechanisms, is probably a useful basis, regardless of wher= individual researchers 
come from. 
> [i] Anatomically modern humans (AMH) appear about 200 thousand years a=o. 
> [ii] The faculty of language FL appears to be a true species property:=shared among human groups (with 
limited individual differences) and in all=essential respects, unique to humans. In particular, there is no mea=ingful 
evidence for existence of language prior to AMH. 
> [iiiJ Recent genomic studies indicate that some human groups (San peop=e) separated from other humans 
about 150kya. As far as we know, they=share FL with other human groups. 
> [iv] The San languages are all and only those that have the curious pr=perty of phonetic clicks, and there may 
be some articulatory adaptation to=producing them (See Huijbregts, forthcoming). 
Nguni languages have clicks, too, but they seem to have imported them from =hoisan. 
> [vi The first (very limited) indication of some form of symbolic behav=or appears at about 75kya. Not long 
after that, we have rich evidenc= of quite extraordinary creative achievements (Lascaux, etc.). 
This is consistent with another observation: Modern humans had a population=bottleneck of 2000-3000 
individuals ca 75000 years ago, which coincides wi=h the Tonga eruption. This does not necessarily mean that the 
volcano kill=d off almost all hominids, but it increased the evolutionary pressure, and=it is possible that our ancestors 
evolved a mutation that enabled them to =utcompete and kill most of the hominid competition (including 
Neanderthals=. What if that mutation is something that roughly translates into =9Csymbolic behavior"? 
I currently think that much of our civilization might be the result of a se=ies of quite specific mutations. Our 
ancestors went from 3000 individuals =o one million and remained there until they developed religions. Religion =nd 
other ideologies are based on a need for conformance to internalized no=ms, i.e. an innate desire to serve as part of a 
system that is larger than=the individual's reputation based group. They were also based on a sha=ed conceptual space. 
Challenge 1 seems mostly to amount to: verify that 1. all human groups have=language, and 2. there is no 
grammatical non-human language. One of the in=eresting questions might be if dolphins have grammatical language, 
another=one concerns the limits of learning in non-human primates. The challenge i= completely empirical. 
Challenge 2 seems very exciting to me; I read it as: has language intrinsic=lly linear order, or is that only imposed 
by the sequentialization of arti=ulation? Grammatical language has a tree structure, and the tree seems to =e created 
probabilistically in the listener, from a string of discrete sym=ols. Would natural language be learnable without the 
constraints of sequen=iality and discreteness? 
Challenge 3: do we need externalization to learn and process language? I wo=ld suspect that an individual can 
play a language game against itself unti= it converges on its own language, but it is not clear that humans are amo=g the 
class of individuals that can do that from scratch. Most research su=gests that there is a critical window in which we 
must pick up our first l=nguage for perfect fluency, and there seems to be no evidence of entirely =ndividualistic 
acquisition/formation of a first language. If that is true =is that a constraint of the way language learning is implemented 
in the hu=an brain, or a complexity constraint within language itself? 
It seems to be clear that learning a programming language changes the way w= think, i.e. it provides evidence 
for a weak version of the Sapir Whorf hy=othesis. But that is not so much a constraint of externalization, but of t=e 
semantic structures addressed by the language.
