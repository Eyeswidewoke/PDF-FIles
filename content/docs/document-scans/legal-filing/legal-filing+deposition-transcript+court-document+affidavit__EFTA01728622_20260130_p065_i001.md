and regulations. They may call themselves the "88 Club" or the "Winged 
Serpents." Some offenders have used religion, satanism, and the occult as a bond-
ing and controlling mechanism. 
Competition, sometimes focusing on sexual acts, is also an effective control 
technique. Victims may compete over who can do an act first or longest. A series 
of sexual acts may result in some special reward or recognition. The offender may 
use peer-pressure to control his victims, and the children will enforce the rules on 
each other. No victim wants to be the one to ruin it for anyone else, and each 
victim may think he or she is the offender's "favorite." All these techniques 
simply capitalize on the developmental needs of children of different ages. 
Violence, threats of violence, and blackmail are most likely used by the 
offender when pushing a victim out or attempting to hold onto a still-desirable 
victim who wants to leave. Sexually explicit notes, audiotapes, videotapes, and 
photographs are effective insurance for a victim's silence. Victims worried about 
disclosure of illegal acts such as substance abuse, joyriding, petty thefts, and van-
dalism are also subject to blackmail. Many victims, however, are most concerned 
over disclosure of and therefore more likely to deny engaging in sex for money, 
bizarre sex acts, homosexual acts in which they were the active participant, 
and sex with other child victims. In child sex rings not only does the offender 
have sex with the child but, in some cases, the children have sex with each other. 
While children may report that they were forced by the offender to perform cer-
tain acts with him, they find it hard to explain sexual experiences with other 
children; therefore, they frequently deny such. activity. One offender told me that 
if you select your victims and seduce them "properly" the secret takes care of 
itself. 
When trying to push a victim out the end of the pipeline, the offender may 
pass the child to another pedophile who prefers older children. The victim now 
enters a new pipeline as a "pre-seduced" victim. "Dumping". the child can also be 
made easier and safer if the child is promoted to another grade or school, moves 
onto another level of scouting or sports, or moves out of the neighborhood. 
Offender-Victim Bond 
Because victims of acquaintance exploitation usually have been carefully seduced 
and often do not realize they are victims, they repeatedly and voluntarily return 
to the offender. Society and the criminal-justice system have a difficult time 
understanding this. If a boy is molested by his neighbor, teacher, or clergy mem-
ber, why does he "allow" it to continue? Most likely he may not initially realize he 
is a victim. Some victims are simply willing to trade sex for attention, affection, 
and gifts and do not believe they are victims. The sex itself might even be enjoy-
able. The offender may be treating them better than anyone has ever treated 
them. They may come to realize they are victims when the offender pushes them 
out. Then they recognize that all the attention, affection, and gifts were just part 
of the master plan to use and exploit them. This may be the final blow for a 
troubled child who has had a difficult life. 
Most of these victims never disclose their victimization. Younger children may 
believe they did something "wrong" or "bad" and are afraid of getting into trouble. 
Older children may be more ashamed and embarrassed. Many victims not only 
do not disclose, but they strongly deny it happened when confronted. In one case 
several boys took the stand and testified concerning the high moral character of
