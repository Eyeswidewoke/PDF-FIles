Fair value measurement and financial Instruments 
The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or 
liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: 
Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 
Level 2: Other inputs. which are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. quoted prices 
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market 
data. The fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial assets are obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may 
not be actively traded. 
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its oven assumptions, based on the best 
information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants would use In pricing the assets or liabilities. 
Assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Changes in the observability of 
valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. 
The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, tune deposits, accounts receivable, prepaid and other current assets, accounts 
payable. and accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the 
immediate or short-term maturity of these instruments. 
Cash and cash equivalents are valued based on Level 1 inputs and time deposits are valued based on Level 2 inputs. There are no assets or liabilities that 
are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 Inputs. 
The Company's non-financial assets, such as property and equipment are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. Such fair 
value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs. 
Recent accounting pronouncement 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASUD No. 2014-09. Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers. which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common standard for all industries. The new guidance is effective for 
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or cumulative effect approach to adopt ASU 
No. 2014-09. In July 2015. the FASB decided to defer the effective date by one year. with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. The 
Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not yet determined whether the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on its 
consolidated financial statements or the method and timing of adoption. 
Note 2-Income taxes 
At the end of each interim period, the Company makes its best estimate of the annual expected effective income tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary 
year-to-date earnings or loss. The income tax provision or benefit related to significant, unusual, or extraordinary items. if applicable, that will be separately 
reported or reported net of their related tax effects are individually computed and recognized in the interim period in which they occur. In addition, the effect of 
changes in enacted tax laws or rates, tax

status. judgment on the realizability of a beginning-of-the-year deferred tax asset in future years or income tax contingencies is recognized in the interim 
period in which the change occurs. 
The computation of the annual expected effective income tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and assumptions including, but not limited 
to. the expected pre-tax income (or loss) for the year, permanent and temporary differences, and the likelihood of the realizability of deferred tax assets 
generated in the current year. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision or benefit for Income taxes may change as new events occur, more 
experience is acquired, additional information is obtained or our tax environment changes. To the extent that the expected annual effective income tax rate 
changes during a quarter. the effect of the change on prior quarters is included in income tax provision in the quarter in which the change occurs. 
For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $4.1 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 
26%. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded an Income tax provision of 37.2 million, which represents an effective income tax rate 
of 26%. The effective Income tax rates are higher than the Canadian federal statutory rate of 15% due primarily to provincial taxes.

assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns. Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid. if
