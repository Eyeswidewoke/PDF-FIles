Proprietary and Confidential 
Partnership Expenses and other similar items and (ii) distributions, to minimize the tax 
and other costs associated with the use of the Investment Subsidiary and to cause such 
costs to be borne directly or indirectly by the Limited Partner(s) for whose benefit the 
Investment Subsidiary was established. 
3.6 
PARALLEL ACCESS FUNDS OR FEEDER FUNDS. 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner may form one or more 
limited partnerships or other investment vehicles to invest in parallel with the Partnership (each, a 
"Parallel Access Fund") and/or Feeder Funds in order to comply with securities laws or to address tax, 
legal, regulatory or other issues of investors in such entity (including with respect to the structure of the 
Underlying Fund). In the event that a Parallel Access Fund or Feeder Fund is established, the General 
Partner may (i) require one or more Limited Partners to withdraw from the Partnership and to be admitted 
as a limited partner of a Parallel Access Fund or Feeder Fund and transfer a proportionate sham of the 
Partnership's assets and liabilities to such Parallel Access Fund or Feeder Fund, (ii) admit one or more 
limited partners of a Parallel Access Fund or Feeder Fund and acquire a proportionate share of such 
Parallel Access Fund's or Feeder Fund's assets and liabilities to the Partnership and (iii) admit any Feeder 
Fund as a limited partner of the Partnership; provided that no Limited Partner shall be required to 
participate in any Parallel Access Fund or Feeder Fund if such participation would result in material 
adverse consequences for such Limited Partner which would not have resulted from such Limited 
Partner's participation in the Partnership. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, 
the General Partner may apply 6.3 of this Agreement to the limited partners of a Feeder Fund on a look-
through basis, as if such limited partners had a direct interest in the Partnership. 
ARTICLE 4 - INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES 
4.1 
INVESTMENT GUIDELINES 
Except as set forth in the following sentence, the Partnership shall only make investments in the 
Underlying Fund. In addition, at such time any funds of the Partnership are not invested in the 
Underlying Fund, distributed to the Partners or applied towards expenses of the Partnership, the 
Partnership may invest such funds in Temporary Investments. 
4.2 
BORROWINGS 
The Partnership may enter into a credit facility with a third party (a "Credit Facility"), which may be 
secured by the Subscriptions of the Limited Partners pursuant to 6.3.4. Repayment of the principal 
amount and any interest, fees and expenses payable in respect of any Credit Facility will be made from 
Subscriptions. 
ERISA COMPLIANCE. 
The General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts so that (a) less than 25% of the total value 
of each class of equity interests in the Partnership is held by "benefit plan investors," defined in 
accordance with Section 3(42) of ERISA and the regulations thereunder, and therefore (b) the assets of 
the Partnership do not constitute plan assets subject to the fiduciary standards of Part 4 of Title I of 
ERISA. In the event that the General Partner were to be deemed a "fiduciary" of any ERISA Partner 
under Section 3(21) of ERISA, then, in addition to whatever action it may take or be required to take 
because it was such a fiduciary:, the General Partner will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the 
occurrence of any prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of 
the Code.
