For such reasons, Harry's proposal is, as=l said, too outrageous to discuss. 
2. 
As you know, Harry's attorney has=commenced a legal action that is intended to facilitate my resignation 
and=the appointment of a successor trustee to take my place. Since you've wanted me removed for some time and 
since I've said.(from the first time you and I met) that I only wanted to serve as trustee=if all the family members 
wanted me to serve, I'm looking forward =o resigning as soon as the court determines how I am to do so and how my 
successor is to be selected. =/u> 
3. 
Given that my replacement is impending, i= might be worth waiting until my successor is in place before 
responding t= my requests for financial disclosure, as it's possible that my successor won't share my views as to what 
the trustee of t=e trusts needs to know before making decisions about distributions. =ikewise, if my successor will be 
identified soon it might make sense for m= to hold off on any distributions and leave it to the new trustee to work with 
you on figuring all of this out. =n this regard I'm kind of a "lame duck" trustee, w=uldn't you say? 
4. 
To the extent that you want to push forwa=d while I remain the trustee, let me again state the basis for 
financial d=sclosure by you. It is that, as trustee, I owe a duty to you and I owe a duty to your children (as the remainder 
beneficiaries o= the trusts). For the present my primary duty is to you and it is to=distribute to you all income earned by 
the trusts, net of expenses,=u> 
Until=l asked about the matter recently, I am aware of no income distributed to me earned from the trusts. I 
cannot be sure, because I have no re=ord of having received any accounting of what is happening to the trusts, 
=ncluding distributions to others (or as required, to me►. Could you =hen please send me the records on these matters 
since 2009, when I appointed Harry to replace me as trustee.=/u> 
I provided reports on income, expenses =nd distributions to Deborah Pechet Quinan last October and I copied 
those reports to Richard (and updated them) in the last 60 days. I think i= might be easiest if Richard forwarded those 
reports to you, but if he can=E2 t for some reason then I will do so when I am back in my office.c/=pan> 
I would like to know more =bout this. Richard Kahn did forward reports to me, but all that I see is from the last 
few years, after I requested information. I don't =ave any records for the years since 2009, when I appointed Harry 
trustee, =either about the income that was supposed to be paid to me or about distri=utions from the Trust or any 
accounting of those years. So could you send them to both of=us, along with documentation about any distributions that 
were made. =In particular, I would like to know the reason why there is virtually no income from the trust •• whether it 
was paid to me from 2009 or not. =AO And about the instructions for any distributions that may have been mad= from 
the Trust. 
and to distribute to you =or pay on your behalf) additional monies as reasonably needed to the extent that your 
income from other sources is not sufficient to s=pport your reasonable expenses.
