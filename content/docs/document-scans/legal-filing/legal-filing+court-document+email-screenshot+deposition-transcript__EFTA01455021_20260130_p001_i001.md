Schedule of Realized Gains and Losses Current Period (continued) 
Adjustments to cost basis can be mace after year-end, in particular, for return of capital adjustments, but may also include adjustments for corporate action events. Therefore there may be differences in cost 
basis reflected on your monthly client brokerage statement at year end versus any subsequent reports, including your 1099-8 or online displays you may have available to you. 
When you report your cost basis on your tax return, it should be verified using all of your own records. In particular, there may be other adjustments which you need to make, but are not required to be made by 
Pershing as it relates to H.R. 1424. You should consult with your tax advisor in order to properly report your gain or loss for tax purposes. Pershing shall not be responsible for and makes no representations or 
warranties with respect to the accuracy of any information that you report to the IRS or other taxing authorities, and, accordingly, disclaims any and all liability that may arise with respect to your use and reliance 
on the information provided herein for such reporting. 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities is adjusted for amortization, accretion or principal paydowns. The method of calculation is based upon the type of fixed income security and certain attributes, obtained from 
sources believed to be rebable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there may be a temporary incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the portfolio system is amended to reflect this 
change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those involving continuously callable bonds, foreign bonds, variable rates, bonds in default, index-linked bonds, bonds sold 
short or bonds that have a negative yield. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns. 
Please refer to the Your Account Information Section in your brokerage account statement for your accounts existing tax-lot disposition method. The disposition method is the method which you have selected to 
use in the disposal of each tax lot of the securities held in your account. If you do not select a method, your account will be defaulted to First In, First Out (FIFO). Your accounts selected tax lot method will be 
used to determine the cost basis for calculating gain andior loss, unless another method was selected at the time of the security disposal, and this may be reported on the IRS F011111099-B.
