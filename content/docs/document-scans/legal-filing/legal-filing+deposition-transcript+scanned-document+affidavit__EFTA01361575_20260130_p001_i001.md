The Talented Mr. Epstein; Lately, Jeffrey Epstein's high-ying style has been drawing oohs 
and aahs: the bachelor nancier lives in New York's largest private residence, claims to 
take only billionaires as clients, and ies celebrities including Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey 
on his Boeing 727. But pierce his air of mystery and the picture changes. VICKY WARD 
explores Epstein's investment career, his ties to retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his 
complicated past Vanity Fair March 2003 
His current fan club extends to Cayne, Henry Rosovsky, the former dean of Harvard's 
Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Larry Summers, Harvard's current president. Harvard 
law professor Alan Dershowitz says, "I'm on my 20th book... The only person outside of my 
immediate family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey." Real-estate developer and philanthropist 
Marshall Rose, who has worked with Epstein on projects in New Albany, Ohio, for Wexner, 
says, "He digests and decodes the information very rapidly, which is to me terrific because 
we have shorter meetings." 
Also on the list of admirers are former senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of 
distinguished scientists, most of whom Epstein has helped fund in recent years. They 
include Nobel Prize winners Gerald Edelman and Murray Gell-Mann, and mathematical 
biologist Martin Nowak. When these men describe Epstein, they talk about "energy" and 
"curiosity," as well as a love for theoretical physics that they don't ordinarily find in laymen. 
Gell-Mann rather sweetly mentions that "there are always pretty ladies around" when he 
goes to dinner chez Epstein, and he's under the impression that Epstein's clients include 
the Queen of England. Both Nowak and Dershowitz were thrilled to find themselves 
shaking the hand of a man named "Andrew" in Epstein's house. "Andrew" turned out to be 
Prince Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit in the back of Dershowitz's law class. 
Epstein gets annoyed when anyone suggests that Wexner "made him." "I had really rich 
clients before," he has said. Yet he does not deny that he and Wexner have a special 
relationship. Epstein sees it as a partnership of equals. "People have said it's like we have 
one brain between two of us: each has a side." 
"I think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns," says Wexner. "But Jeffrey sees 
patterns in politics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends. 
My skills are not in investment strategy, and, as everyone who knows Jeffrey knows, his 
are not in fashion and design. We frequently discuss world trends as each of us sees 
them." 
By the time Epstein met Wexner, the latter was a retail legend who had built a $3 billion 
empire-one that now includes Victoria's Secret, Express, and Bath & Body Works-from 
$5,000 lent him by his aunt. 'Wexner saw in Jeffrey the type of person who had the 
potential to realize his (Jeffrey's) dreams," says someone who has worked closely with 
both men. "He gave Jeffrey the ball, and Jeffrey hit it out of the park." 
Wexner, through a trust, bought the town house in which Epstein now lives for a reported 
$13.2 million in 1989. In 1993, Wexner married Abigail Koppel, a 31-year-old lawyer, and 
the newlyweds relocated to Ohio; in 1996, Epstein moved into the town house. Public 
documents suggest that the house is still owned by the trust that bought it, but Epstein has 
said that he now owns the house. 
Wexner trusts Epstein so completely that he has assigned him the power of fiduciary over 
all of his private trusts and foundations, says a source close to Wexner. In 1992, Epstein 
even persuaded Wexner to put him on the board of the Wexner Foundation in place of
