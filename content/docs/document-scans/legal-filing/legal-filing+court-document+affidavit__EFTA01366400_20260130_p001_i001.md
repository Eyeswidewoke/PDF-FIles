offering price for the units was determined by negotiations between us and the reprtwentative. 
The determination of our per unit offering price was more arbitrary than would typically be the case if we 
were an operating company. Among the factors considered in determining initial public offering price were the 
higory and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies, prior offerings 
of those companies, our management, our capital structure, and currently prevailing general conditions in equity 
securities markets, including current market valuations of publicly traded companies considered comparable to 
our company. We cannot assure you. however, that the price at which the units, common stock or warrants will 
sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial public offering price or that an active 
trading market in our units, common stock or warrants will develop and continue after this offering. 
We expect our units to be listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "GPACU" and, once the common stock and 
warrants begin separate trading, to have our common stock and warrants listed on NASDAQ under the symbols 
"GPAC" and "GPACW". respectively. 
The following table shows the underwriting discounts and commissions that we are to pay to the underwriters 
in connection with this offering. These amounts arc shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the 
underwriters' over-allotment option.

aggregate payabk to the undenwiters for deferred underwriting commissions to be placed in a trust account located in the 
United States as described herein. The deferred commissions will be released to the underwriters only on completion of an 
initial business combination. in an amount equal to 50.30 multiplied by the number of shares of common stock sold as part of 
the units in this offaing. as described in this prospectus. 
In addition, we have agreed to pay for the FINRA -related fees and expenses of the underwriters' legal 
counsel, not to exceed $25,000. 
If we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from tlx: closing of this offering. the 
trustee and the underwriters have agreed that (i) they will forfeit any rights or claims to their deferred 
underwriting discounts and commissions, including any accrued interest thereon, then in the trust account, and (ii) 
that the defer-Jul underwriters' discounts and commissions will be distributed on a pro rata basis, together with 
any accrued interest thereon (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) to the public stockholders. 
In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell units in the open market. Purchases 
and sales in the open market may include short sales. purchases to cover short positions, which may include 
purchases pursuant to the over-allotment option, and stabilizing purchases.

• Short sales involve scamdary market sales by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they arc 
required to purchase in the offering. 
• "Covered" short sales are sales of units in an amount up to the number of units represented by the 
underwriters' over-allotment option. 
• "Naked" short sales arc sales of units in an amount in excess of the number of units represented by the 
underwriters' over-allotment option. 
• Covering transactions involve purchases of units either pursuant to the over-allotment option or in the open 
market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. 
• To close a naked shun position, the underwriters must purchase shares in the open market after the 
distribution has been completed. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters arc 
concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the units in the open market after pricing 
that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. 
• To close a covered short position, the underwriters must purchase units in the open market after the 
distribution has been completed or must exercise the over-allotment option. In determining the source of 
shares to close the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of 
units available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase units
