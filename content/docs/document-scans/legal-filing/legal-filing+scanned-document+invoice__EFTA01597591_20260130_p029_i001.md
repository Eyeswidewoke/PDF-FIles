E-mail Communications 
We discourage clients from transmitting personal or confidential information through e-mail as 
these may be sent via unsecure servers and/or facilities which are easily accessible by third 
parties (such as international public and private data transmission networks and internet service 
providers) and are typically routed via (multiple) foreign jurisdictions. If you choose to send 
personal and confidential information to us via e-mail, you understand and accept that e-mail 
transmissions may entail a considerable amount of danger and risk including: 
• 
lack of confidentiality (e-mails and their attachments can be read and/or monitored 
without detection); 
• 
manipulation or falsification of the senders address or of the e-mail's (or 
attachment's) content (e.g. changing the sender's address(es) or details); 
• 
system outages and other transmission errors, which can cause e-mails and. their 
attachments to be delayed, mutilated, misrouted and deleted; 
• 
viruses, worms, Trojan horses etc. may be spread undetected by third parties and 
may cause considerable damage; and 
• 
interception by third parties 
and agree that we cannot be responsible for any loss or damages that occur as a result, such 
as losses or damages arising from mistaken identity or unauthorized access and the use of the 
information (for any purpose) by others who may intercept or otherwise access the 
communications during and after transmission.
