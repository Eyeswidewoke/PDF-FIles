Interview 
The big picture 
Deutsche AWM's evolutionary path will be continued in a new guise. This will be 
underpinned by our experts' know-how and our investment process. 
Disappointments 
are best avoided 
by realistic return 
targets. 
Mr. Kreuzkamp, welcome to the CIO View 
and congratulations on your new job: 
you are taking over as Chief Investment 
Officer (CIO) of a platform which is about 
to be split up again, three years into its 
existence. Do you consider yourself as 
king of a lost empire? 
On the contrary. The amalgamation of 
several independent units under the 
roof of Deutsche AWM three years ago 
established the basis for aggregating our 
know-how, creating a uniform investment 
process and ensuring a coherent 
approach. We can still draw on these 
benefits after the incorporation of wealth 
management into Deutsche Bank's retail 
business. 
What are the consequences of this step 
for a wealth-management (WM) client? 
Not many. It is too early for a definitive 
statement because we are still 
considering the optimal distribution of 
some resources. Asset management 
will continue to actively support our WM 
colleagues in order to maintain the quality 
of investment decisions. This step will also 
allow us to improve our customer care. In 
the past, the dialog with WM clients, who 
may use a wide range of our services, was 
conducted from various divisions within 
the bank. This is to be replaced now by a 
coordinated, uniform customer contact. 
Back to Deutsche AWM, back to you. 
Like your predecessor, you started out 
in the fixed-income business. Is this a 
disadvantage in times when equities and 
multi asset are carrying the day? 
Weil, in my last position as CIO for E MEA 
and in fact well before then, I could 
hardly avoid the topics of equities and 
multi asset! By now, I feel completely 
at home with all asset classes. I em also 
delighted to be able to rely on all our 
excellent experts within Deutsche AWM. 
Nevenheless, I value my fixed-income 
experience. I am convinced that the fixed-
income perspective, even the analysis 
of individual bond issues, requires and 
encourages a holistic, global view of 
financial markets. The three major factors 
for every economy are interest rates, 
inflation and currency These are also 
the basis of everyday business in fixed 
income. As an equity specialist, you must 
focus more on corporate parameters, 
unless you are an equity strategist. 
Will you emphasize other features than 
your predecessor? 
Since he has left now and is no longer my 
boss, I can tell you that Asoka Wahrmann 
has left a very well-ordered business unit. 
For this reason, my objective is continuity. 
Most changes will be in line with what 
we have been doing so far. Take the 
continuing globalization (A our business. 
The Americas and Asia will be further 
strengthened by the establishment of CIO 
Offices in these regions and an increase 
in the number of locally-based investment 
Past performance is not indicative of future returns. It is not possible to invest directly 
in an index. No assurance can be given that any forecast or target will be reached. 
Forecasts are based on assumptions, estimates, opinions and hypothetical models or

investment can fall as well as rise and your capital may be at risk. You might not get 
back the amount originally invested at any point in time.
