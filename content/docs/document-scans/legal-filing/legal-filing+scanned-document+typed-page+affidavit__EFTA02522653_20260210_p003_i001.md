<tel 
> . However, I am unavailable tomorrow (Monday) because of prior commitments until 
approximately 7:45 PM. 
=ext, you should know that I'm not an employee of CFI nor do I have any authority to 
speak on behalf of CFI. I'm writing to you from my personal email account in part to underscore that point. I do retain a 
CFI email address in part as a courtesy to me and in part because it serves a business purpose (for example, I still receive 
occasional emails addressed to the president of the organization). 
=urning to the substance of your allegations, first you should be aware that I take the 
issue of sexual harassment very seriously. This is confirmed by the fact that after I was hired by CFI as its in-house lawyer 
(a position I held prior to becoming president and CEO) I insisted that the organization adopt a comprehensive zero-
tolerance harassment policy covering workplace harassment. Moreover, during the time I was president and CEO we 
had three separate state trainings for the entire staff on sexual harassment issues. In addition, where necessary, we did 
not hesitate to expend significant resources, including retaining outside investigators, to conduct serious, detailed 
inquiries into harassment claims. One such inquiry cost the organization over $40,000. Therefore, any suggestion that I 
do not personally take harassment claims seriously is amply disconfirmed by my record. 
=egarding the alleged incident on the 2011 cruise, the first I became aware of it was 
when Pat Beauchamp, CFI =99s business manager and the employee responsible for cruise logistics, wrote to me in 2013 
indicating she objected to inviting Lawrence Krauss on our upcoming Galapagos cruise. I found this strange, and I 
responded to her almost immediately asking the reasons for her objection. She gave two reasons. The first was that 
Krauss did not pay sufficient attention to the guests on the 2011 cruise. I had heard this concern from one guest myself; 
on the other hand, I also heard from several guests that they thought Krauss's presentations were= excellent and a 
highlight of the cruise. Accordingly, I did not give this concern much weight. 
=he second reason was that Krauss had allegedly asked a female guest on the cruise to 
join him and his partner, apparently for some sort of sexual activity (I cannot recall whether Krauss was engaged or 
married or just seriously involved with his female companion at the time, although they were clearly romantically 
involved and seemed very much in love). This is the first I had heard of this proposition. No complaint by the guest or 
anyone else had been made to me at the time of the cruise, although I was on the cruise and clearly visible throughout 
the cruise. 
= asked Ms. Beauchamp for contact information for this guest. I did call the guest and 
she substantially confirmed what Ms. Beauchamp had said. I apologized on behalf of the organization. The guest 
indicated although she was taken aback by Krauss's proposition=at the time, she did not want to pursue the matter 
further. I then got in contact with Krauss. Krauss denied the allegation. In light of the guest's reluctance to pursue the 
matter and Krauss's own denial and, importantly, because between the time of the 2011 cruise and the Galapagos cruise 
we had instituted a policy regarding harassment at any CFI event, which covers not just employees, but speakers and 
attendees, I decided to go ahead with my plan and have Krauss as a speaker on the Galapagos cruise. Krauss was fully 
aware of our harassment policy regarding CFI events because we had had a discussion about it. Therefore, I expected 
him to comply with that policy on the Galapagos cruise. As far as I know he did, because we received no complaints 
about his conduct. Nor have we received any complaints about his conduct at other events. 
=et me just take a moment to highlight the 2012 policy, which you can find in full here, 
http://www.centerforinquiry.n=wbr>et/blogs/entry/cfis_new_policy_on_hostile_conduct_harassment_=t_conferences/ 
along with the announcement I made explaining the rationale for the policy. This policy was, certainly at its time, 
arguably the strongest any nonprofit organization had regarding conduct at its events. Again, this policy shows that any 
suggestion that CFI, as an organization, or that I personally took a lax attitude regarding harassment is completely 
without factual foundation. 
=n your email you mentioned that one staffer resigned after I invited Krauss on the 
Galapagos cruise. I'm n=t aware of any staffer resigning because of that. If you give me a name I could comment on the
