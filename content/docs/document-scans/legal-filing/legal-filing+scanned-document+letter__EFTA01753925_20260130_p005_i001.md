This perspective is-seen most clearly, perhaps, when pollsters presented Americans in 1993 wit= the statement, 
"Nothing the U.S. could accomplish in Somalia is worth t=e death of even one more U.S. soldier." Fully 60 percent 
expressed agreement. This is not such an unusual position=for humanitarian ventures. If Red Cross or other workers are 
killed while =arrying out humanitarian missions, their organizations frequently threaten=to withdraw, no matter how 
much good they may be doing. 
Some commentators, =ncluding such unlikely soulmates as Andrew Bacevich, Robert Kagan, John Me=rsheimer, Rachel 
Maddow and Vladimir Putin, have variously maintained that=we have seen the rise of a new American militarism in the 
last decades or that Americans hail from Mars. 
But that perspectiv= extrapolates far too much from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In these=cases, opinion was 
impelled not by a propensity toward militarism, but, as=with entry into World War II, by the reaction to a direct attack 
on the United States. These ventures—the 9/1= wars—have proved to be aberrations from usual patterns, not portents 
of=the future. Although they demonstrate that Americans remain willing to str=ke back hard if attacked, they do not 
indicate a change in the public's reticence about becoming militarily in=olved in other kinds of missions, particularly 
humanitarian ones.</=> 
An examination of t=e trends in a poll question designed to tap "isolationism" does not su=gest a surge of militarism. 
Instead, it documents something of a rise in p=blic wariness regarding military intervention beginning with the Vietnam 
War and, thereafter, a fair amount of steadines= punctured by spike-like ups and downs in response to current events, 
incl=ding 9/11 and its ensuing wars. 
Since 1945, pollste=s have periodically asked, "Do you think it will be best for the future 4 this country if we take an 
active part in world affairs, or if we stayed=out of world affairs?" The question seems to have been framed to generate 
an "internationalist" response. In 194=, after all, the United States possessed something like half of the wealth=of the 
world and therefore scarcely had an option about "taking an activ= part in world affairs," as it was so blandly and 
unthreateningly presented. And, so queried, only 19 percent=span style="font-size:18.0pt"> [61 of poll respondents in 
1945 picked the "stay out" or "isolationist" o=tion. The authors of the poll question got the number they probably 
wanted= 
(Actually, to gener=te high levels of this quality, the query can be reformulated to "We sho=ldn't think so much in 
international terms but concentrate more on our own=national problems and building up our strength and prosperity 
here at home." In that rendering, measured "is=lationism" registers <http://www.gallup.com/poll/22489/little-change-
isolationi=t-sentiment-among-americans.aspx> 17130 to =0 percentage points higher.) 
In the post-war yea=s the "stay out" percentage rose <http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/public-
perspective/ppsca./43/43095.pdf> 161 a bit to around 25 percent, bu= it had descended to 16 percent in 1965 in the 
aftermath of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and as the war in Vietna= was about to begin. The experience of that war 
pushed it much higher—to=31 to 36 percent—as part of what has been called the "Vietnam syndrome=" 
It has stayed at ar=und that level ever since. There was a temporary downward dip during the G=lf War of 1991 and 
interesting spikes upward at the time of the Kosovo con=lict in 1999 even though no American troops were lost and 
even though it was deemed successful at the time. And= in this century, the "stay out" percentage dropped to 14, its 
lowest =ecorded level, in the aftermath of 9/11. It rose the next year, and then p=unged downward again in 2003 and 
2004, the first two years of the Iraq War. By 2006, however, it had risen again =o post-Vietnam levels where it has 
remained through 2012 
<http://www.thechicagocouncil.org/UserFiles/File/Task%20Fo=ce%20Reports/2012_CCS_Report.pdf> (8], th= last time 
the question was asked. 
Given the bland att=activeness of the "take an active part in world affairs" option, it is=impressive that around a third or 
more of the public since Vietnam has gen=rally rejected it to embrace the "stay our option. However, this is likely to be 
more nearly an expression of =ariness about costly and frustrating military entanglements than a serious=yearning for
