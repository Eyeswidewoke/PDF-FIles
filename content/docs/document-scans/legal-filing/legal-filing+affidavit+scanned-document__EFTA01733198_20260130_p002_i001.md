Another Palestinian sports tournament for children has been name= after terrorists. In keeping with PA policy of 
honoring terrorists and pr=moting them as heroes and role models, official PA school the School for Boys, held a tennis 
tournament n=med after terrorists Basel and Farouq Sidr who recently attempted to murde= Israelis. Several teams in 
the tournament were also named after terrorist= who either murdered or attempted to murder Israelis in the last two 
month=. 
Basel Sidr, 19, tried to stab Israeli border policemen near Dama=cus Gate in the Old City of Jerusalem on Oct. 14, 2015 
and was shot and ki=led by police while trying to escape. Farouq Sidr planned to stab Israeli =oldiers in Hebron on Oct. 
29, 2015, and soldiers saw him approaching with = knife in hand and shot and killed him. 
Palestinian Media Watch <http://www.palwatch.org> exposed last week that another Palestinian school honored 
ano=her terrorist stabber, naming a football tournamen= 
<http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?f==157&doc_id=16376> after him. 
The PA glorification of terrorist murderers as role models in PA=schools is an essential component of PA educational 
policy. PMW has docume=ted that the PA has named at least 25 schools

0210715.pdfilpage=11> afte= terrorists—fibril Rajoub, Head of the Supreme Council for Sport and Yout= Affairs recently 
suggested that PA schools teach one terrorist's "will," =hat he published on his Facebook page before attacking Israelis 
and being =illed. While expressing support for the current Palestinian terror attacks=against Israelis, which have 
included murderous stabbings and shootings, R=joub said: 
"These are individual operations (i=e., terror attacks), however, they comprise bravery and composure. They co=tain a 
range of values that obligate the political elite and political and=national Palestinian powers to see the will of that hero 
who wrote=a blog. It can be a document they could teach in schools, on the meaning o= Martyrdom-death... and the 
meaning of patriotism... These are individual =cts of bravery, and I am proud of them. I congratulate everyone who 
carrie= them out... the fighter, the prisoner, or the Martyr, they are assets to =he entire Palestinian people."

Rajoub was apparently referring to terrorist Baha Alyan who carr=ed out a shooting and stabbing attack on a Jerusalem 
bus, killing 3. Befor= his attack, Alyan wrote "10 commandments of every Martyr" on his Facebook=page, phrased as a 
"will," explaining how Palestinians should respond to h=s "Martyrdom." Fatah tweeted these instructions. (See below) 
PMW has reported on the continuous PA glorification of terrorist= <http://=ww.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=448> in 
general and in particular of every single terrorist wh= has attacked Israelis in the current terror=campaign 
<http://www.palwatch.org/ma=n.aspx?fi=157&doc_id=16124> 
Several teams in this PA school's tennis tournament were also na=ed after terrorists who either stabbed, shot, or 
rammed their cars into Is=aelis during the current terror wave, killing or attempting to kill them. =mong them murderer 
Ibrahim Samir Skafi, a 23-year-old Palestinian terroris= who rammed his car into 3 border policemen, killing one and 
wounding two,=near Hebron on Nov. 4, 2015. Skafi was shot and killed by soldiers. Anothe= terrorist who was also 
honored with having a team named after him was Ala= Al-Natsheh who in 2003 attempted to carry out a shooting attack 
in Kiryat=Arba.
