file maker memo 
Well =ile maker is a database program that is used in ever aspect of doing =usiness worldwide. Though they don't 
advertise as such it is owned and =un by Apple, but kept a separate company because it is a windows =olution as well 
and being non-apple branded helps in corporate =ales. 
I bring it up because the =urrent set up that was intended to give a small part of these services =t is not really being used 
by anyone and not even sure if it was ever =eally set up. But each dept has to generate paperwork for the company =ut 
there is currently no standard to generate this paperwork. The =tandard in place is using unsecured public email 
accounts in some cases =r basic programs like word or excel. The major problem with this =pproach is every job done for 
the company has great value in it to be =ined in the future, what vendor did we use on that job? Inventory of =rt work. 
Location management, think of it as the platform where when =ou need information about any aspect of your company, 
associates, =eetings, plans time sheets employee collaboration there it is in real =ime. You guys do all this stuff already 
its just on scraps of paper and =ften random email accounts that are no being tracked or archived in =nyway. As an 
experienced software professional I am almost shocked this =spect of the business does not have a platform. Everyone 
wants and =eeds one, they don't know what to call it, but is what they are asking =or, because filemaker can be 
programed to do almost anything. So when I =it it on a meeting with construction and they are talking to each other =ith 
scraps of paper and notebooks writing back and forth to each other =t looks like a game of telephone, that by its nature 
increases the =hances the details will be communicated unclearly and all we are left =ith is a he said she said argument. I 
think we can do better. The good =ews is that filemaker runs on both pc and mac so people for whatever =eason cant 
use a mac can still use this solution. 
It would directly help Lesley in a =ig way be more productive, as an example I asked for a contact list but =er current set 
up is so hard to use this basic request seemed hard for =er computer to do. I need to fix that for her, it will help you have 
a =ore organized and productive staff. 
I feel I could write =xample after example but let me just refer to some basic marketing =aterial : FileMaker. Pro 11 is 
powerful, easy-to-use =atabase software that helps you and your team get any task done faster =n Windows, Mac and 
the web. Also try the FileMaker Go for i Phone and =ileMaker Go for iPad apps to view, edit and search your data on the 
=o. 
Its what you =uys do every single day as a team its just this will give the team the =ools they need to manage any task on 
the fly and we can selectively use =he data they collect as we see fit. Or should I say as YOU see =it. 
I think once =e set up some very basic ones and you see it in action you will know =xactly what it is. It is the solution to 
running a business. What you =ave in place now is email, and quickbooks. Those are good tools but not =hat good. 
Quickbooks I think is the only thing set up at all for the =ompany. So think about it as the quickbooks for every other task 
anyone =ver does for you but unlike quickbooks we could get this information =ut to the team in anyway imaginable. 
Right now you are locked into =itrix and cisco switches. Well that sucks, that stuff is super =xpensive and once you are 
locked in you are stuck! it forces you to =ontinue to by more and more of them for every location and they are not =00% 
mac compatible. As your IT guy I need to get you off this train =ooner than later, it doesn't mean we throw the current 
system away but =ts my job to see how I can save you and your company millions of =ollars over the next 5-10 years as 
you will be forced to continue to =uy and support that more expensive solution that really is not giving =ou much bang 
for the buck at all. Sorry to break the news but it's =rue! facts are facts and I have been wanting to start this dialouge for
