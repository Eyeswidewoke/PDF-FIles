To the best knowledge of Purchaser and Intel. except for certain pre-existing agreements described in the 
Schedule 14D-9. no employment, equity contribution, or other agreement. arrangement or understanding between 
any executive officer or director of Mobileye, on the one hand. and Intel. Purchaser or Mobileye. on the other 
hand, existed as of the date of the Purchase Agreement, and the Offer is not conditioned upon any executive 
officer or director of Mobileye entering into any such agreement. arrangement or understanding. 
It is possible that, in addition to the Employment Agreement Addendum, certain members of Mobileye's 
current management team will enter into new employment arrangements with Mobileye after the completion of 
the Offer and the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. Such arrangements may include the 
right to purchase or participate in the equity of Intel or its affiliates. There can be no assurance that any parties 
will reach an agreement on any terms. or at all. 
13. Certain Effects of the Offer. 
Market for the Shares. The purchase of Shafts pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Mobileye 
shareholders and the number of Shares that might otherwise trade publicly, which could adversely affect the 
liquidity and market value of the remaining Shares. We cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of 
Shares that might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or 
marketability of, the Shares or whether such reduction would cause future market prices to be greater or less than 
the Offer Consideration. 
In addition, you should be aware that, after amendment of Mobileye's articles of association, effective as of 
the Offer axing, pursuant to the Conversion Resolutions proposed to be approved at the ECM. record 
ownership of Mobileye shares can only be transferred pursuant to a notarial deed executed before a Dutch notary. 
which will require compliance by the transferor and transferee of Shares with various administrative formalities 
under Dutch law and will also require shareholders to incur costs for Dutch notarial fees when they transfer 
Mobileye shares. Furthermore, you should be aware that after Amendment No. 2. any share acquired by a 
Mobileye shareholder after the date of Amendment No. 2 would not be transferable prior to March 1. 2019. 
unless the Mobileye Board has approved such transfer. 
NYSE Listing. Depending upon the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer, the Shares may no 
longer meet the standards for continued listing on the NYSE. According to the NYSE's published guidelines, the 
Shares would not meet the criteria for continued listing on the NYSE if. among other things, the total number of 
Mobileye shareholders is not at least 400. If, as a result of the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the 
Shares no longer meet these criteria, the listing of Shares on the NYSE would be discontinued and the market for 
the Shares will be adversely affected. Regardless of whether the Shares continue to meet the criteria for 
continued listing on the NYSE, after the Offer Closing, we intend to cause Mobileye to terminate the listing of 
the Shares on the NYSE. 
Margin Regulations. The Shares are currently "margin securities" under the Regulations of the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), which has the effect, among other 
things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of the Shares. Depending upon factors similar to 
those described above regarding the market for the Shares and listing, it is possible that, following the Offer, the 
Shares would no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the margin regulations of the Federal 
Reserve Board and, therefore, could no longer be used as collateral for loans made by brokers. 
Exchange Act Registration. The Shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act. Such registration 
may be terminated upon application by Mobileye to the SEC if the Shares are neither listed on a national 
securities exchange nor held by 300 or more holders of record. subject to fulfilling certain conditions. 
Termination of registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act would substantially reduce the information 
required to be furnished by Mobileye to its shareholders and to the SEC and would make certain provisions of the 
Exchange Act no longer applicable to Mobileye. Furthermore, the ability of "affiliates" of Mobileye and persons
