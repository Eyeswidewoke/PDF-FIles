Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa... Page 18 of 32 
Derek C. Bok could be reached for comment Monday. 
The New York Daily News has reported that New York State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, who is 
currently running for Governor, has returned an approximately $50,000 gift from Epstein. And Mark A. 
Green, who is running to replace Spitzer as attorney general, has returned a $10,000 donation, according 
to the Daily News. 
In April, Epstein lawyer Guy Fronstin accepted a plea deal that would have the billionaire plead guilty to 
one count of aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony, and would give him five years' probation 
but no criminal record, according to the Post. That deal was to only apply to one of the five alleged 
victims. 
Fronstin has since been fired, and a new defense attorney, Jack A. Goldberger, said that no such plea 
deal was made by any of Epstein's attorneys, according to the Post. 
Goldberger and Dershowitz could not be reached for comment Monday. 
According to a police report released last week, someone contacted a woman involved in the case and 
told her that she would be compensated for not cooperating with the police. The woman said she was 
told that those who did talk to the police "would be dealt with," according to the Post. 
Goldberger told the Post that while his client did host women at his house, at issue was whether Epstein 
knew how old they were. 
"He's never denied girls came to the house," Goldberger told the Post. 
According to the probable cause affidavit released by the Palm Beach Police Department, one of the 
girls Epstein solicited for sexual acts was a 16-year-old girl who performed sexual acts for him in his 
bedroom on several occasions over a span of two years. 
The woman, whose name was blotted from the affidavit, told the police that she would completely 
remove her clothes and begin massaging Epstein's back, while he lay on a massage table, wearing only a 
towel. She would then massage his chest, and Epstein would begin to masturbate both himself and the 
woman. 
The woman told the police that Epstein asked for her age and knew she was 16. She said that Epstein 
had asked her and another female to have intercourse in front of him, and that he also performed oral 
intercourse on both of them. 
On one occasion when the women were fondling each other, Epstein allegedly grabbed the 16-year old 
woman, turned her over on to her stomach on the massage table, and forcibly penetrated her vagina with 
his penis. 
"She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued to pump inside her," 
according to the affidavit. "She screamed 'No!' and Epstein stopped." Epstein apologized and paid the 
woman $1000 for that massage, according to the affidavit.

Epstein, who in 2003 was named one of New York's most eligible bachelors by the New York Post, 
achieved fame after he took then-President Clinton on an African AIDS awareness tour on his personal 
jet.
