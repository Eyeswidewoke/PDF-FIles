Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide 
§ 14 
documented to the appropriate case file(s), FBI employees are not required to complete a 
separate FD-999 to document the dissemination of information to the applicable agencies. 
14.8.8.2 
(U) NOTIFICATION To DIVISION HEAD 
(U//FOUO) In addition, FBI employees must notify their FO/FBIHQ division heads as soon 
as practicable, but no later than five calendar days, after learning of facts giving reason to 
suspect imminent or ongoing child abuse. The process for notification will vary if the 
information is obtained pursuant to assigned job duties or if it is obtained unrelated to 
assigned job duties, such as from an employee's personal life. Each FO/FBIHQ division head 
may designate a secondary official to receive child abuse notifications. For FOs, the designee 
must be no lower than an ASAC; for FBIHQ divisions or offices, the designee must be no 
lower than an SC. The appointment of an FO/FBIHQ division head's designee must be 
documented in an EC to the appropriate administrative file(s). 
(U//FOUO) If the notification related to information that is obtained unrelated to assigned job 
duties (e.g., notification pertains to an employee learning firsthand of facts giving reason to 
suspect child abuse in their personal life), employees must separately email or provide in an 
EC (or other applicable method) this notification to the FO/FBIHQ division head or 
designee; if the notification is completed via email, the employee must document the email 
notification, to include the date, in an EC or other applicable method and route it to the 
applicable division file. Employees can provide verbal notification to the FO/FBIHQ division 
head or designee in exigent circumstances, but as soon as practicable, the notifying employee 
must properly document the referral and must note in the EC (or other applicable method) the 
date and time of the verbal notification. 
(U//FOUO) In the instances that the notification is related to assigned job duties, such as 
serving as a duty agent and receiving a complaint, tip, or lead pertains to an FBI investigation 
that is pending or will be opened, an existing processes (such as a case opening EC) are the 
appropriate way to notify the division head as long as the information is ultimately received 
by the FO/FBIHQ head or designee. For example, a Guardian Type 1 & 2 Assessment 
briefing to the FO/FBIHQ head or designee is sufficient to satisfy notification requirement 
under DIOG subsection 14.8.8.2, but this briefing should be noted in the appropriate file. If 
there is not an established process that cause the information to reach the FO/FBIHQ head or 
designee, the appropriate individual in the supervisory team should notify the FO/FBIHQ 
head or designee via email and note this in the appropriate file. 
(U//FOUO) In the instances an existing process exists because the notification pertains to a 
complaint, tip, or lead or an FBI investigation that is pending or will be opened and an 
existing process would cause the information to be received by the division head or designee, 
the employee who first becomes aware of the suspected child abuse does not also have to be 
the same employee who notifies the division head or designee. Rather, the best situated 
employee in the supervisory chain may notify the division head or designee verbally or 
through the existing process. For example, when a SOS identifies facts giving reason to 
suspect child abuse in an ongoing criminal investigation, the SIA supervising the SOS or the 
SSIA over the squad may contact the FO head or designee to provide this notification and 
document this notification within the applicable case file. 
(U//FOUO) It is essential FO/FBIHQ division leaders are informed of suspected imminent or 
ongoing child abuse reports and a reliable written record of reporting is serialized in the 
14-19
