FBI Fires Agents as Republican Senators Denounce Jack Smith Over Jan. 6 Scrutiny of Phone Records 
Fox News (10/07, Wolf, Singman) reported that Director Patel announced the firing of multiple agents and the 
dismantling of the bureau's CR-15 public corruption squad after it was revealed that several Republican senators' 
private phone communications had been monitored during Special Counsel Jack Smith's Jan. 6 investigation. 
Director Patel said the actions were part of a broader effort to "clean up a diseased temple three decades in the 
making," adding that the FBI is "identifying the rot, removing those who weaponized law enforcement for political 
purposes and those who do not meet the standards of this mission while restoring integrity to the FBI." According 
to the article, Director Patel also wrote on X that "transparency is important, and accountability is critical;' 
emphasizing that the bureau had "terminated employees, abolished the weaponized CR-15 squad, and initiated an 
ongoing investigation with more accountability measures ahead; while Deputy Director Bongino echoed the same 
message of reform. The article noted that the CR-15 squad had been part of the FBI's Washington Field Office and 
helped Special Counsel Jack Smith investigate former President Donald Trump, and that Director Patel reiterated his 
commitment to ensuring the bureau "will never again be used as a political weapon against the American people." 
Analysis from CNN (10/07, Blake) reported that congressional Republicans accused the Biden administration and 
the FBI of "weaponization" after learning that Smith had obtained the phone records of nine GOP lawmakers as 
part of his January 6 investigation, with figures such as Sen. Chuck Grassley calling it "worse than Watergate" and 
Director Patel claiming it proved the records were "seized for political purposes?' The article explained that despite 
these claims, the FBI obtained court-approved call logs—not wiretaps or content recordings—and that such records 
are a standard part of investigations into events where lawmakers were central to key communications, particularly 
around Trump's pressure campaign to overturn the 2020 election. According to the article, the request for phone 
records covered the narrow period of January 4-8, 2021, and there is no indication that the lawmakers themselves 
were investigation targets, only that investigators sought to understand their interactions during that critical 
period. The article further contrasted this case with actions taken by the Trump Justice Department, which had 
secretly subpoenaed the phone records of Democratic lawmakers—including Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell—
as part of leak investigations into the Russia probe, a move later criticized by Trump's own attorney general, Bill 
Barr. The article noted that Inspector General Michael Horowitz previously warned that such subpoenas risk 
"chilling" congressional oversight but emphasized that without evidence of political intent, the available facts 
suggest Smith's request was a legitimate—if constitutionally sensitive—part of a criminal investigation rather than 
partisan targeting. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Axios (10/07, Bragg), The Center Square

Multiple People Arrested After FBI, LAPD Executed Search Warrants in Los Angeles 
KCAL (CBS-2) (10/07, Hylton) reported that the FBI and LAPD executed search warrants in the LA Harbor area, 
arresting 13 individuals alleged to be members of the "Rancho San Pedro" (RSP) gang. According to the article, the 
arrests were made after a multi-year investigation involving the LAPD, FBI, and U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security Investigations, targeting the gang's alleged involvement in various criminal activities and acts of
