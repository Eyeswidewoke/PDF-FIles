Definitions 
In the last chapter a variety of terms were used and deliberately left undefined in 
order to make a point. Many of these terms are thought to be basic and are, 
therefore, frequently not defined. Both nonprofessionals and professionals use 
them regularly. 
Seeming disagreements and differences of opinion are often the result of con-
fusion over definition. Some say that pedophiles can be treated, and others claim 
that they cannot. Some say there is a connection between missing children and 
child pornography, and others say there is not. Some people say that communi-
ties should be notified when sex offenders move into a neighborhood, others say 
it is an unproductive violation of privacy. This is not simply a matter of a differ-
ence of opinion. 
Referring to the same thing by different names and 
different things by the same name frequently creates con-
fusion. For example the same 15-year-old individual can be 
referred to as a(n) "baby," "child," "youth," "juvenile," 
"minor," "adolescent," "adult," or (as in one forensic 
psychological evaluation) "underage adult." A father who 
coerces, a violent abductor, an acquaintance who seduces, 
a child-pornography collector, or an older boyfriend can all 
be referred to as a "child molester" or "pedophile." 
In written and spoken communication definitions are crucial to understand-
ing. The problem is that when we use basic or common terms, we rarely define 
them. What is the difference between the sexual.abuse of children and sexual 
exploitation of children? What is the difference between child molestation and 
child rape? What does it mean to someone who reads in the newspaper that a 
child was the victim of "indecent assault," a child was "sodomized," or an 
offender was convicted of "indecent liberties" with a child? 
Terms such as "sexual exploitation of children and youth" or "sexual exploita-
tion of children and adolescents" imply that a youth or an adolescent is not a 
child. At what age does a child become a youth or adolescent? If such a person is 
sexually victimized, is that considered youth molestation or sexual abuse of 
adolescents? 
Although many recognize the importance of definitions, a major problem is 
the fact that many terms do not have one universally accepted definition. They 
have different meanings on different levels to different disciplines. For example 
the dictionary or lay person's definition of a "pedophile" is not the same as the 
psychiatric definition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
4th edition, Text Revision, commonly referred to as the DSM-IV-TR (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2000). Legal definitions may not be the same as societal 
attitudes. The definition problem is most acute when professionals from different 
disciplines come together to work or communicate abOut the sexual vic-
timization of children. Definition are less important when investigating 
and prosecuting cases and more important when discussing, researching, and 
writing about the nature and scope of a problem. This publication is an example 
of the latter. 
Referring to the same thing 
by different names and 
different things by the 
same name frequently 
creates confusion.
