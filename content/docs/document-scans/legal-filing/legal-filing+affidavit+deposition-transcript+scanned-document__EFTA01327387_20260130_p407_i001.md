"Tax" as defined in Section 4.3 hereto. 
"UCC" means the Uniform Commercial Code as the same may, from time to time be in 
effect in the State of New York; provided, that in the event that, by reason of mandatory 
provisions of law, any or all of the attachment, perfection or priority of, or remedies with respect 
to, Mortgagee's Lien on any Mortgage Collateral is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code 
as in effect in a jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the term "UCC" shall mean the 
Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in such other jurisdiction for purposes of the provisions 
of this Mortgage relating to such attachment, perfection, priority or remedies and for purposes of 
definitions related to such provisions; provided further, that to the extent that the term "UCC" is 
used to define any term herein and such term is defined differently in different Articles of the 
UCC, the definition of such term contained in Article 9 shall govern.
