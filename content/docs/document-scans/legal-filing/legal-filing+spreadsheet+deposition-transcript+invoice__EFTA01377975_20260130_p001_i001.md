Our historical combined financial statements have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and 
accounting records of IAC. The combined financial statements reflect the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the businesses

our historical combined financial statements. including the basis on which the expenses have been allocated from IAC, are reasonable. However, the 
allocations may not reflect the expenses that we may have incurred as an independent, stand-alone company for the periods presented. Our historical 
combined financial statements may not reflect what our actual financial position, results of operation and cash flows would have been if we had been an 
independent, stand-alone company for the periods presented. For the purposes of our financial statements, our income taxes have been computed on an as-if 
standalone, separate tax return basis.
