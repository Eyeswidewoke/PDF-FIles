burden—unless some deus ex machina, such as a technological breakthrough, can boost growth. As Roland 
Nash, head of research at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank, puts it: "Can the West, with its regulated 
industry, uncompetitive labour and large government, afford its borrowing-funded living standards and 
increasingly expensive public sectors?" 
Sovereign default is far from inconceivable. Many people are forecasting that Greece, despite its bail-out package 
from the EU and the IMF, will be unable to repay its debts in full and on time. Faced with the choice between 
punishing their populations with austerity programmes and letting down foreign creditors, countries may find it 
easier to disappoint the foreigners. Defaults have been common in the past, as Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff 
showed in their book, "This Time is Different". Adam Smith, a founding father of economics, noted in "The Wealth 
of Nations" that "when national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree, there is scarce, I believe, 
a single instance of their having being fairly and completely paid." 
Governments now face a tricky period when they have to deal with the debt overhang, decide how quickly to cut 
their deficits (and risk undermining growth), and try to distribute the pain of doing so as equitably as possible. 
Debt is often treated as a moral issue as well as an economic one. Margaret Atwood, in her book of essays, 
"Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth", notes that the Aramaic words for debt and sin are the same. And 
some versions of the Lord's Prayer say "Forgive us our debts" rather than "Forgive us our trespasses". 
The Live 8 campaign in 2005 tried to shame developed nations into forgiving the debts of poor countries, 
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Economists have developed the concept of "odious debt" in which citizens 
should not be forced to repay money borrowed by tyrannical or kleptocratic rulers. Interest payments on debt are 
often regarded as an onerous burden placed on the poor; interest is seen as an unjustified reward for capital, a 
concept that goes back to Aristotle and is implicit in the Christian idea of usury. Islam forbids it altogether. The 
book of Deuteronomy suggested a debt amnesty every seven years, which survived into later Jewish custom. 
But conventional morality has not always been on the side of the borrowers. Some regard debt as the road to ruin 
and the failure to repay as a breach of trust. In the 18th and 19th century debtors in Britain were often thrown 
into jail (as in Charles Dickens's "Little Dorrit"), though Samuel Johnson spotted the flaws of the practice: "We 
have now imprisoned one generation of debtors after another, but we do not find that their numbers lessen. We 
have now learned that rashness and imprudence will not be deterred from taking credit; let us try whether fraud 
and avarice may be more easily restrained from giving it." 
Movable morals 
In the past 100 years the moral battle has moved in favour of the debtors. Bankruptcy is no longer stigmatised 
but simply regarded as bad luck. When consumers borrow beyond their means, the blame is laid on lax lending 
practices rather than irresponsible borrowing. Governments have encouraged more people to become homeowners 
and thus to take on debt. And defaulting on one's debts has become much less cumbersome; in the current 
housing slump many American homeowners have resorted to "jingle mail", dropping their keys through the 
lender's letterbox and walking away from their property. 
In business, a few failed directorships are a sign of entrepreneurship rather than incompetence. America's Chapter 
11 process allows the managers of companies to remain in place and the business to be protected from its 
creditors. The number of companies with safe AAA credit ratings has collapsed as more have acted on the theory 
that a debt-laden balance-sheet is more efficient (because interest payments are tax-deductible in most 
countries). 
The recent crisis has also diminished belief in the judgment of the financial markets. The role of banks in the 
credit crunch and the cost of the financial sector bail-out has undermined the idea that the markets assess risk 
fairly and rationally. Instead, higher borrowing costs are seen as the result of unscrupulous speculation. 
The role of sovereign credit-default swaps (CDS), a way of betting on the likelihood of a country's failure to repay 
the money it has borrowed, has proved particularly controversial. Southern European nations, which have been at
