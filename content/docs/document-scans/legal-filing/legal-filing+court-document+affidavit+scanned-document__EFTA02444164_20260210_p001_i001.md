Appendix i 
STATEMENT OF RISK FACTORS 
An investment in the Units (and the Constituent Securities) is speculative and involves a high 
degree of risk. 
The Subscriber must carefully consider such risks, including, without 
limitation, the risks described below. The following risks, if they occur, could materially harm 
the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The risks 
and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks 
and uncertainties may also adversely impair its plans and business operations. If any of the 
risks actually occur, the Company may not be able to commence operation or, if it commences 
operating, the Company's financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
significantly. Further, the value of the Company's securities would likely decline and the 
Subscriber could lose all or part of his, her or its investment. 
The Company has no operating history or financial statements and is a start-up company. 
While the principals of the Company have been formulating plans for the operation of the 
Company prior to its incorporation, the Company was only formed on March 31, 2009. The 
Company is a start-up entity, has no prior business history, has only nominal assets and does not 
yet have any material operations. Therefore, the Company will face all the risks inherent in a new 
venture. To date, the Company has been devoting its efforts to various organizational and start-
up activities. As a result, the Company has no operating history that can be used to evaluate it. 
The Company and its proposed business need to be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and 
problems frequently encountered by companies in the initial stage of development. The Company 
plans to use the proceeds of the Offering to purchase the business and assets of an affiliated entity, 
to develop its infrastructure, to hire personnel and to implement its business plans. Most probably 
it will be required to raise additional funds to enable it to implement its business plans unless it is 
able to generate sufficient net revenues from its early operations to provide the necessary funds 
for such purpose. Even if the Company commences operations, there is no assurance that any 
profitability will be achieved by the Company, or if achieved, will be sustained or that any return 
will be provided to the Subscriber or other investors. 
The Company plans to develop a business that has not yet been attempted and that has not 
been demonstrated to have any commercial viability. 
The Company's basic business model as follows: 
• 
to establish a geographically broad-based source of qualified physicians who will provide 
patients with laser assisted lipoysis, who will subscribe to become members of the 
Company's list of physicians to whom the Company will refer and recommend prospective 
patients and who will pay the Company a licensing fee or other fee for such membership 
(physicians who become members of the Company's list of physicians to whom the 
Company will refer and recommend prospective patients are hereinafter sometimes 
referred to as "Physician Members") 
• 
through the use of infomercials and other marketing plans, to generate interest in laser 
assisted lipoysis provided by such member physicians and thereby attract prospective
