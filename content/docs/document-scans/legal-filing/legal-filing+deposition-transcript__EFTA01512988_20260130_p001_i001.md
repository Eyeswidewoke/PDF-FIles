For the Period 2/1/11 to 2/28/11 
Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are indicative values as of the 
close of business of the date of this statement and, except as otherwise agreed in writing, these valuations do not represent the actual terms at which transactions or securities could be bought or sold or 
new transactions could be entered into, or the actual terms on which existing transactions or securities could be liquidated as of the date of this statement. We do not warrant their completeness or 
accuracy. These valuations are derived from proprietary models based upon well-recognized financial principles and we have, when necessary to calculate the present value of future cash flows, made 
reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions. Valuations based on other models or different assumptions may yield different results. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility 
for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the valuations. (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. 
Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended solely for your own use. Please refer to the trade confirmation for details of each transaction. 
Important Information Regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily, 
weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the 
event of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements and online.Accordingly, investors 
should not rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with respect to ARS. Where J.P. Morgan was unable to obtain a price from an outside service for a particular ARS. the price 
column on your statement and online will indicate "$0.0O" which however should not be relied on as the price at which ARS would trade. 
Please review your statements promptty and report any discrepancies immediately to an account officer whose name appears on the contact page of these statements.
