be redeemed. 
We will comply with the tender offer rules or proxy rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in 
connection with our business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to 
receive our tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, such stockholder may not become aware of the 
opportunity to redeem its shares, In addition, the tender offer documents or proxy materials, as applicable, that we 
will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the 
various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem public shares. In the event

NASDAQ may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors' ability to 
make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 
We intend to apply to have our units listed on NASDAQ on or promptly after the date of this prospectus and 
our common stock and warrants listed on or promptly after their date of separation. Although after giving effect to 
this offering we expect to meet, on a pro forma basis, the minimum initial listing standards set forth in the 
NASDAQ listing standards, we cannot assure you that our securities will be, or will continue to be, listed on 
NASDAQ in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on 
NASDAQ prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain fmancial, distribution and stock 
price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders' equity (generally $2,500,000) and a 
minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 round-lot holders). Additionally, in connection with 
our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with NASDAQ's initial listing 
requirements, which are more rigorous than NASDAQ's continued listing requirements, in order to continue to 
maintain the listing of our securities on NASDAQ. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be 
at least $4 per sham and our stockholders' equity would generally be required to be at least $5 million. We cannot 
assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time. 
If NASDAQ delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on 
another national securities exchange. we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If 
this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences. including: 
• a limited availability of market quotations for our securities: 
• reduced liquidity for our securities: 
• a determination that our common stock is a "penny stock" which will requite brokers trading in our 
common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in 
the secondary trading market for our securities: 
• a limited amount of news and analyst coverage: and 
• a decreased ability to inure additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 
The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts 
the states from regulating the sale of certain securities which arc referred to as "covered securities." Because we 
expect that our units and eventually our common stock and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ. our units, 
common stock and warrants will be covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale 
of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud,
