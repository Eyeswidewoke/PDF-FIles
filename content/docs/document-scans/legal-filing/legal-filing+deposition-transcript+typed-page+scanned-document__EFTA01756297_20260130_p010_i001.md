The existence of substantial Western military bases on the Arabian Peninsul= has always been problematic for the Gulf 
monarchies. To their critics, th= hosting of non-Arab, non-Muslim armies is an affront to Islam and to nati=nal 
sovereignty. Their proliferation will likely draw further criticism, a=d perhaps serve as yet another flashpoint for the 
region's opposition mo=ements. 
Among the largest Western installations in the Gulf is al-Udeid Air Base in=Qatar, which owes its existence to the 
country's former ruler, Sheikh Ha=ad bin Khalifa al-Thani. In 1999, al-Thani told the United States that he =ould like to 
see 10,000 American servicemen permanently based in the emira=e, and over the next few years, the United States duly 
began shifting pers=nnel there from Saudi Arabia. Today, al-Udeid houses several thousand U.S.=servicemen at a time 
and has also served as a forward headquarters of U.S.=Central Command (CENTCOM), a U.S. Air Force expeditionary air 
wing, a CIA =ase, and an array of U.S. Special Forces teams. Nearby Bahrain 
hosts<http:=/www.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/world/middleeast/18fleet.html?_r=0> [2] the =.S. Naval Forces Central 
Command and the entire U.S. Fifth Fleet, which in=ludes some 6,000 U.S. personnel. The United States recently 
downsized its =orce in Kuwait, but four U.S. infantry bases remain, including Camp Patrio=, which is believed to house 
about 3,000 U.S. soldiers and two air bases. 
The United States plans to further expand its regional military presence in=the near future. As CENTCOM recently 
announced, the country will be sendin= the latest U.S. antimissile systems to at least four Gulf states. These a=e new 
versions of the Patriot anti-missile batteries that the United State= already sent to the region and are meant to assuage 
the Gulf rulers' fe=rs of Iranian missile attacks. Tellingly, the announcement did not reveal =xactly which states had 
agreed to take the U.S. weapons. Yet analysts wide=y assume that the unnamed states are Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and 
the UAE. 
Equally, if not more, problematic than hosting so many foreign military bas=s has been the Gulf monarchies' ever-rising 
spending on Western arms. Al=hough much of the equipment is inappropriate for bolstering defensive capa=ilities or is 
superfluous to peacekeeping operations -- the kinds of missi=ns Gulf soldiers are likely to find themselves undertaking --
Gulf leaders=regarded the trade as necessary for their protection. 
By most measures, such spending has gotten out of hand. As a proportion of =DP, the Gulf monarchies' purchases make 
them the biggest arms buyers in =he world. Even the poorer Gulf states, which are grappling with declining =esources 
and serious socioeconomic pressures, spend far beyond their means= 
Of all of the monarchies' purchases, Saudi and UAE procurements have attr=cted the most attention. In 2009 alone, the 
UAE purchased nearly $8 billio= in U.S. military equipment, making it the United States' biggest arms c=stomer that year. 
Saudi Arabia, for its part, purchased about $3.3 billion=in hardware. In December 2011, the United States announced 
that it had fin=lized a $30 billion sale of Boeing-manufactured F-15 fighter jets to the S=udi Royal Air Force. And a UAE 
firm has reportedly partnered with a U.S. c=mpany, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, to bring predator drones to 
t=e UAE. This venture makes the UAE the first foreign buyer to acquire U.S. =rone technology. 
In the West, the sales have not been without criticism. The pro-Israel lobb=, for example, has repeatedly argued that the 
sale of such high-grade equi=ment to the Gulf monarchies will erode Israel's "qualitative edge" i= the region. The 
programs will also prove troublesome inside the Arab king=oms, as the region's ruling families will find it increasingly 
difficult=to justify such massive transactions to their beleaguered national populat=ons. Given existing regional tensions, 
they are likely to continue increas=ng spending anyway -- be it on tanks, warplanes, or naval vessels. 
COMMON CAUSE 
The monarchies are also under pressure to deal with Iran, and some of them =ee posturing against Tehran as a 
convenient mechanism for containing domes=ic opposition, distracting from growing socio-economic pressures, and 
mani=ulating sectarian tensions. Since the beginning of the Arab Spring, the Gu=f monarchs have gone to great lengths 
to highlight Shia membership in oppo=ition movements, a tactic that has allowed them to delegitimize critics --=falsely --
as Iranian agents. 
Thus far, the strategy has enjoyed some limited success; members of the Gul='s Sunni populations have been quick to 
accuse Shia activists of being tra=tors. Many Western authorities continue to lend support to the monarchies =n the 
grounds that the alternative would be Iran-style theocratic, revolut=onary, and anti-Western governments. 
Still, the risks of such rabid anti-Iran sentiments are serious and possibl= existential. By acting on such attitudes, Gulf 
monarchs have undermined t=eir longstanding position as neutral peace brokers and distributors of reg=onal 
development aid, and made themselves into legitimate targets in any c=nflict in the Persian Gulf. It is unlikely that the 
fathers of today's G=lf rulers would have allowed that to happen, no matter how deeply they dis=rusted their neighbor 
across the Gulf. This previous generation sidelined =ost confrontations with Iran -- including even the 1971 seizure of
