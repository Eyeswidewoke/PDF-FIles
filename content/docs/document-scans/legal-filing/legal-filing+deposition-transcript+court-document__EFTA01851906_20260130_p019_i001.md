Role of Advisors 
Donors establishing an advised fund may designate any 
person over 18 years of age to be an advisor on the fund. A 
fund can have more than one fund advisor but preferably no 
more than three. If a fund is advised jointly, upon the death 
of one fund advisor, the remaining fund advisor(s) retains the 
privileges associated with the fund. 
Successor Advisors 
The donor and any fund advisor may designate any person 
within one generation to be a successor advisor to exercise 
the privileges and duties of a fund advisor. Successor 
advisors may assume the privilege to advise the fund only 
after the deaths or resignations of all initial fund advisors 
named on the fund. The successor advisor(s) may be 
required to provide written notification and sufficient proof 
of the donor's or fund advisor's death prior to assuming the 
privileges and duties of a fund advisor. Successor advisors 
may not appoint further successors but may appoint 
additional fund advisors as long as they are in the same 
generation as the successor advisor. If the successor advisor 
is a minor, the community foundation's board of directors 
reserves the right to require that grant recommendations be 
made by the minor's legal guardian.
