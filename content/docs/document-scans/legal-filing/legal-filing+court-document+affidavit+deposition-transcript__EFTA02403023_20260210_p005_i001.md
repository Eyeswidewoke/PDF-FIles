4. A third strategy or resolving the paradoxes is discussed in another paper, which is that the 
apparent non-localities are a coordinate artifact associated with an ambiguity in extending 
Einstein's procedure for synchronizing clocks to clocks with a finite frequency far from the 
origin of coordinates of a reference frame[251. 
The results are tentative, in that we find evidence that both effects may play a role, but we 
are not able to definitively show the problem is solved. It must also be emphasized that because 
of the strategy we choose we cannot address directly the paradoxes of Schatzhold and Unruh[51 
and Hossenfelder[613. We can here only address similar issues which appear in n-Minkowski 
spacetime; whether the same insights apply to the cases discussed in [5, 61 can only be resolved 
by further work. 
1.2 Outline of the argument 
This having been said, let us introduce the basic ideas and results that are discussed below. 
It is easy to see how an issue with locality arises in K-Minkowski spacetime. The details are in 
the sections below but for the sake of clarity of argument we can now sketch the key points of the 
argument. 
If momentum space is curved then translations on momentum space don't commute with 
each other. But if the spacetime coordinates are constructed to be complementary to momentum 
space in the usual way, they are the generators of translations on momentum space, which means 
that they don't commute. So we have a non-commutative spacetime geometry We have then 
to investigate whether this non-commutative spacetime can support a consistent framework for 
physics, which agrees with experiment. 
The new commutation relations have to be consistent with a ten parameter algebra of symme-
tries, inherited from the symmetries of the deSitter geometry of momentum space. It turns out this 
can be achieved if we take it that the space coordinates do not commute with the time coordinate 
[t, 
= itpx. 
(4) 
where to = VrIG is the Planck time. This certainly gives rise to some general problems of interpre-
tation because the notion of an event, which requires localizing two or more particles at the same 
point of space and time, appears to be compromised by the inability to make both space and time 
measurements simultaneously sharp4. 
The next step is that, in order to preserve the commutation relations (4), the Lorentz transfor-
mations of the position and time coordinates of a relativistic particle turn out to depend on its 
energy and momenturn[3]. (These transformations are reviewed in (37,38) below.) 
This energy and momentum dependence of the Lorentz transformations leads directly to prob-
lems with locality. To see why, consider a scattering event defined by the coincidence of four 
worldlines of particles of different energy and momentum-two worldines for the incoming parti-
cles and two worldlines for the outgoing particles. Suppose that one inertial observer sees them 
31t should also be mentioned that Hossenfelderl6l does consider the possibility that quantum effects resolve the 
problem, but comes to a different conclusion then we do here. Whether that is because the models are different or for 
other reasons remains unclear. 
' Alternative formulations of DSR which involve instead of (4) an energy dependent metric also give rise to similar 
confusions, but these will not be discussed here.
