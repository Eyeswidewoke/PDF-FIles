509 F. Supp. 815, *; 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11119, **; 
1981-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P64,165 
nearly identical to those sib judge. The Court ruled that in the absence of a showing that the denial of staff privileges was not 
rationally based, or that it was precipitated by invidious racial discrimination. It is not the province of this court to legislate the 
final resolution of a problem indigenous to the medical profession.' Id. at 952. 
There was also some indication given by plaintiff at his deposition that his cause of action really involved a due process and 
equal protection claim. See plaintiff's deposition at 52. 
[`*19] By adopting the memorandum decision of the district court, the Fifth Circuit found 
no constitutional defect in excluding Dr. Shaw from membership on a hospital medical staff 
by reason of his status as a podiatrist. The Court declined to interfere in an area that 
traditionally has been the province of the medical profession and not ordinarily subject to 
governmental regulation. In light of Shaw, the Court must reject plaintiff's invitation to find 
that he has been deprived of a federal right in this instance. 
The Court agrees with the private hospital and physician defendants that they are not 
liable under § 1983 even if plaintiff had been deprived of some federal right. It is 
established that (HN9] private entities are subject to the Civil Rights laws only if their 
activities are significantly affected with state involvement: 
The district court correctly held that (1-114101 a private hospital is subject to the provisions of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the 
Fourteenth Amendment oNy if its activities are significantly affected with state involvement. [HN11) Section 1983 and 
the Fourteenth Amendrnert do not preclude invidious discrimination by private parties. Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3.

Greco v. Orange Memorial Hospital Corporation, 513 F.2d 873, 877-878 (5th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 423 U.S. 1000, 96 S. Ct. 433, 46 L. Ed. 2d 376 (1975). 
[FIN12) The mere existence of some government tie to a private organization is not 
sufficient to support a finding of state action where the state has not sufficiently involved 
itself in the invidious discrimination. Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 92 S. Ct. 
1965, 32 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1972). Moreover, the state must be involved in more than some 
activity of the offending institution itself, it must have been involved with the activity that 
caused the injury to plaintiff. Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 95 S. Ct. 
449, 42 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1979) ("(T)he inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close 
nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the 
action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself." 8); New York Jaycees v. 
United States Jaycees, 512 F.2d 856 (2d Cir. 1975). Accord, Sims v. Jefferson Downs, 
611 F.2d 609 (5th Cir. 1980). 
8. Id 419 U.S. at 351. 95 S. Cl. at 453. also quoted in Sims v. Jefferson Down. infra at 611. 
r21] Plaintiffs only reference to the state action nexus by the private hospital 
defendants is that these hospitals are licensed by state law. 
[FIN13] "The mere fact that a 
business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the 
State for purposes of the Fourteenth [1323] Amendment." Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison 
Co., supra at 350, 95 S. Ct. at 453. 
9. Paragraph 49 C of the Amended Complaint refers to FIa.Stat. Chap. 395 concerning Hospital Licensing and Regulation 
procedures for hospitals situated in this state.
