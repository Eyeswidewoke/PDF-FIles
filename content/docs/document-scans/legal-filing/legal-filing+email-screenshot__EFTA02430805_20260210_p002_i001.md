for past terror attacks and current weapons smuggling encourage those who 
approve and carry out such actions to waive some of the rules of caution? 
Second, in a tense period in which Israel is trading threats of war with Iran and its 
allies in the region, should Israel be goading the enemy instead of maintaining 
restraint? 
Ptdvenosement 
Third, is it right, because of this hit, to embarrass the authorities in the United 
Arab Emirates, who share with Israel the fear of the Iranian threat? Fourth, in 
preparation for the operation, were the risks of exposure and restrictions on 
similar future actions taken into account? 
Fifth, is there justification in damaging relations with friendly European countries 
whose passports were used by Mabhouh's assassins? 
Sixth, is it proper to place in harm's way the Israelis whose identities were 
ostensibly stolen and used by the assassins? The fear of identity theft recalls dark 
regimes, and such an action seems to do disproportionate damage. 
Should all Jews considering coming to live in Israel from the West be concerned 
that their names might be linked with espionage and terror incidents throughout 
the world? Stricter security rules at airports and border crossings make things 
harder on the intelligence services. But does the response require endangering 
the liberty, and perhaps even the lives, of civilians whose identities were used 
without their knowledge in a secret operation? 
All these questions, particularly the claims of identity theft, need to be closely 
scrutinized. Lessons must be learned for the future, and the findings must be 
exposed to the light of day.
