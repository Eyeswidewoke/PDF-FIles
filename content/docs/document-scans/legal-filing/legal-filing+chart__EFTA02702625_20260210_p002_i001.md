09 November 2012 
• 
As a result, we stay underweight US equities and have moved risk from our 
US credit longs into Europe. Our initial US equity underweight was against 
Europe and EM Asia. Our recent downgrade of Q I growth in the Euro area 
and better activity data in China made us move the lion's share of the 
overweight versus the US into EM Asia (see Wednesday's Global Market 
Outlook and Strategy). 
• 
Chinese activity data continue to surprise on the upside. October data for 
IP, retail sales and fixed investment each came above our expectations. This 
creates upside risk, but no change yet, to our forecasts which already assume a 
gentle rise in quarterly growth rates from under 7% early this year to just 
above 8% in Ql. Better data reduce the need for renewed fiscal and monetary 
stimulus. The 18th Party Congress started yesterday, will last a week, and will 
be followed by the announcement of the next leadership. More important for 
the economic outlook will be the Annual Central Economic Working 
Conference that will be held in December. We expect it to support continued 
moderate fiscal policy, a neutral monetary policy, and further economic 
rebalancing towards domestic consumption. It may also lower the 2013 
growth target to 7%. For more details, see Haibin Zhu in today's GDW. 
Fixed Income 
• 
Bonds rallied strongly, in the slipstream of the tumbling equity market. 
President Obama's re-election perhaps also diminishes expectations of a 
change in course at the Fed. 
• 
The ECB and the Bank of England stood pat at their policy meetings this 
week, but the latter delivered a curveball today, announcing that its net 
coupon income from QE would be transferred to the UK Treasury from next 
year on. The near-term effect is a slight monetary easing. as the money will 
be used to reduce the amount of gilts in issue, similar to QE itself. 
• 
Beyond that, this is another small step towards perceptions that monetary• 
policy is no longer independent from fiscal policy, like the Bank ofJapan's 
joint statement with two government ministers last month. Nobody knows the 
tipping point at which these perceptions feed into much higher inflation 
expectations, just that we'll know it when we see it. 
• 
Core euro bond yields arc towards the low end of the range, and we expect 
them to head higher. But we focus more risk on spread compression trades, 
via ovenvcighis in Euro area peripherals, US MBS, and EM local bonds vs 
DM. 
Equities 
• Equity markets fell sharply post US elections, but we are not changing our 
strategy. 
• From a month ago, we avoided directional longs in our GMOS model equity 
portfolio due to elevated positions by spec investors (see Charts A 10 and Al2 
in today's Flows & Liquidity). We preferred to focus instead on regional and 
sectoral trades. We stay with the same strategy focusing our 
recommendations on EM Asia across regions, and Cyclical stocks and US 
Home builders across sectors. 
• 
The rebound in the October global manufacturing PMI is what keeps us long 
Cyclical vs. Defensive equity sectors. Is this a high-beta trade? Not
