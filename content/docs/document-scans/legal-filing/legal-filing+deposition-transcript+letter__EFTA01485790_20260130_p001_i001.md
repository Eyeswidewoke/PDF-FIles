For the Period 10f Ift I to 10/31/11 
Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are derived from proprietary 
models based upon well-recognized financial principles and we have, when necessary to calculate the present value of future cash flows, made reasonable estimates about relevant future market 
conditions. Valuations based on other models or different assumptions may yield different results. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates 
used in deriving the valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information 
purposes only and are intended solely for your own use. Please refer to the trade confirmation for details of each transaction. 
These statements are not official documents for income tax reporting purposes and should not be relied upon for such purposes, including determination of income, cost basis, amortization or accretion, 
or gainloss. Such information, which may be inaccurate, incomplete or subject to updating, should be confirmed with your records and your tax advisor. 
Important Information Regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily. 
weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the 
event of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements and online.Accordingly, investors 
should not rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with respect to ARS. Where J.P. Morgan was unable to obtain a price from an outside service for a particular ARS. the price 
column on your statement and online will indicate "50.00" which should not be relied on as the price at which ARS would trade.
