Options 
The Underlying Funds write i.e., sell) and purchase put and call options. Sales of options 
where an Underlying Fund does not own the underlying asset to which the option is referenced can 
involve theoretically unlimited risk. 
The seller (writer) of a call option which is covered (tg,, the writer holds the underlying 
security) may hedge its long position in the underlying security by earning premium upon the sale 
of the option. In exchange for the premium, the seller assumes the risk of a decline in the market 
price of the underlying security below the purchase price of the underlying security (to the extent the 
decline exceeds the premium received), and gives up the opportunity for gain on the underlying 
security above the exercise price of the option. The seller of an uncovered call option assumes the 
risk of a theoretically unlimited increase in the market price of the underlying security above the 
exercise price of the option. The Securities necessary to satisfy the exercise of an uncovered call 
option may be unavailable for purchase, except at much higher prices, thereby reducing or 
eliminating the value of the premium. Purchasing Securities to cover the exercise of an uncovered 
call option can cause the price of the Securities to increase, thereby exacerbating the loss. The buyer 
of a call option assumes the risk of losing its entire premium investment in the call option. 
The seller (writer) of a put option which is covered (e.g., the writer has a short position in 
the underlying security) may hedge its short position in the underlying security by earning 
premium upon the sale of the option. In exchange for the premium, the seller assumes the risk of 
an increase in the market price of the underlying security above the sales price (in establishing the 
short position) of the underlying security (to the extent the increase exceeds the premium received), 
and gives up the opportunity for gain on the underlying security if the market price falls below the 
exercise price of the option. The seller of an uncovered put option assumes the risk of a decline 
in the market price of the underlying security below the exercise price of the option. The buyer of 
a put option assumes the risk of losing its entire investment in the put option. 
Volatility is a principal component of options pricing. If the volatility in the market for the 
asset underlying the options held or sold by an Underlying Fund changes materially, the 
Underlying Fund directly could incur substantial losses even if the options in question would have 
generated substantial profits if the current price levels had been in effect at expiration. 
Credit Default Swaps 
The Underlying Funds purchase and sell credit derivatives contracts (primarily credit 
default swaps). Credit default swaps can be used to implement the Management Company's view 
that a particular credit, or group of credits, will experience credit improvement or deterioration. In 
the case of expected credit improvement, an Underlying Fund may sell credit default protection in 
which it receives a premium to take on the risk. In such an instance, the obligation of an 
Underlying Fund to make payments upon the occurrence of a credit event creates leveraged 
exposure to the credit risk of the referenced entity. An Underlying Fund may also buy credit 
default protection with respect to a referenced entity if, in the judgment of the Management 
Company, there is a likelihood of credit deterioration. In such instance, the Underlying Fund will 
pay a premium regardless of whether there is a credit event.
