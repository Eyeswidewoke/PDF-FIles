American observers =ho doubt that Gulf states would make such calculations should recall how K=wait responded in the 
lead-up to Iraq's invasion in 1990. When faced with = build-up of Iraqi forces along its border, Kuwait decided not to 
mobilize its military out of fear that the m=ve would provoke Saddam Hussein. The incentives for Gulf states to make 
si=ilar strategic calculations in the future will be greater when Iran has an=inventory of nuclear weapons to match its 
growing ballistic missile capabilities. 
The Gulf states, mo=eover, will likely reason that the U.S. capability to threaten or use fore= against a nuclear Iran will be 
significantly diminished. Even without nuc=ear weapons, Gulf states have seen, in their view, a long history of American 
reluctance to threaten or use fo=ce against Iran. For example, the United States took no direct military ac=ion against 
Iran after it aided and abetted Hezbollah bombings against Ame=icans in Lebanon in the 1980s, after Iran supported the 
bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996,=or even after Iran supported the deadly campaign of improvised 
explosive d=vices (IEDs) against U.S. troops in Iraq. Gulf states will no doubt judge =hat if the United States was unable 
and unwilling to attack Tehran under these circumstances, then it is certa=nly not going to attack Iran in the future, 
when it will be able to retali=te with nuclear weapons. 
American policymake=s may counter that Iran would never be foolish enough to threaten or use n=clear weapons 
against the United States, given its robust nuclear deterren=e posture. But the threat or use of nuclear weapons might 
not look so foolish from Iran's perspective. One of =he great strategic lessons drawn from the long history of conflict in 
the =iddle East is this: Do not go to war without nuclear weapons, as Saddam Hu=sein did when he invaded Kuwait. The 
corollary is: Do not allow the United States to methodically build-up =orces in the Gulf prior to invading, as Saddam did 
both in the run-up to t=e 1991 re-conquest of Kuwait and in 2003, before the drive to topple the r=gime in Baghdad. 
Drawing upon these =essons, Iran will likely do everything in its power to deny the United Sta=es the ability to surge 
conventional forces into the region -- and that mi=ht include threatening to target U.S. forces with nuclear weapons. 
Iran might accept the risk that preemptive us= of nuclear weapons could bring on American nuclear retaliation, because 
f=ilure to do so would mean certain destruction for the regime. The United S=ates would be able to build-up 
conventional forces in the region and oust Iran's leaders just as it did i= Baghdad. 
This line of strate=ic reasoning runs counter to conventional wisdom in the West, but we actua=ly know little or nothing 
about what Iranian decision-makers think about n=clear weapons or deterrence theory. Since the Iranian revolution in 
1979, opportunities for the exchange of pr=fessional views between Western and Iranian scholars, policymakers, and 
mi=itary leaders on these critically important issues have been extremely lim=ted. Therefore, it's not unreasonable to 
assume that the Iranians, like American policymakers in the early stage= of developing their nuclear triad doctrine, will 
think of nuclear weapons=as merely "big artillery." Unfortunately, the United States and =ts security partners lack 
formal and informal exchanges with the Iranians akin to the Cold War discussions and arms cont=ol negotiations 
between the Americans and Soviets, which allowed both part=es to develop mutual understandings of the other's 
perception of nuclear w=apons. These understandings were essential for crisis management in the Cold War strategic 
relationship aft=r the Cuban missile crisis. 
Meanwhile, the Gulf=states, led by Saudi Arabia, are likely to look for their own nuclear dete=rents. Much like France 
wanted its own nuclear force de frappe during the =old War, the Gulf states will want their own nuclear weapons to 
deter Iran. Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf=states will worry that the United States would be deterred from coming to 
=heir defense in future regional crises by Iran's nuclear weapons. 
Saudi Arabia and ot=er Arab states are likely to see nuclear weapons as a quick fix for all of=their security woes. 
Although they have been on a shopping spree in the pa=t decade, buying expensive and sophisticated Western military 
technology, they have had a tough time absorbing the new =echnology and fully utilizing and integrating weapons 
systems. To be sure =in a rough net assessment <http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/images/jfq-55/6.pdf> , Saudi Arabia and 
its allies in the Gulf=have significantly greater conventional capabilities than Iran. But if Iran goes nuclear, they will want 
to follow=suit.
