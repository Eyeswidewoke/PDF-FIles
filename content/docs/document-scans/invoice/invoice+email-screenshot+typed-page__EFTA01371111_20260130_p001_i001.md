Shifting Gears, Initiate Buy/$209 price 
target 
Following its multi-year implementation of Precision Railroading, CP is shifting 
gears from cost take-out to top-line growth. As such, we see at least 15% 
upside in shares as CP leverages its reduced cost base, improved service levels, 
and recent capacity investments to retake market share. We expect this to 
translate to 30% cumulative EPS growth over the next two years, reflecting mid-
single digit revenue growth, significant operating leverage, and accelerated share 
repurchase. Against this backdrop we see CP's relative valuation discount as 
unsustainable, which underpins our positive stance to shares. Initiate Buy. 
CP is putting the pieces together to leverage a better network 
After bringing its cost base closer in-line with CNI, CP has undertaken a number 
of initiatives aimed at growing its top-line and taking market share. Further, it has 
made a number of capacity investments in order to improve service levels and 
more profitably handle volume growth across its network and reinvigorated its 
sales/marketing efforts to expand existing relationships and win new business. At 
the end of the day, we believe CP is poised to drive best in class volume growth 
and increase operating leverage as it targets higher margin business. To this point, 
we forecast volume growth (measured by revenue ton-miles [RTM's]) to increase 
at a 3.1% CAGR over the next two years compared to 2.4% CAGR at CM. In 
addition to CP's company-specific initiatives, we see outsized tailwinds for CP's 
domestic intermodal, crude by rail, and potash businesses which support our view 
of best-in-class volume growth. 
CP's discounted valuation does not reflect earnings potential 
CP currently trades at 17.5x NTM EPS estimates, which is about 3% below its 5-
year avg. and nearly 10% below CNI's current multiple. CP's de-rating (both on 
an absolute and relative basis) has coincided with a 20% decline in merchandise 
volumes from 2014 to 2017E while CNI's merchandise ATM's are now back in-
line with 2014 levels. Given our expectation for CP to generate best-in-class RTM 
growth over the next several years, we see potential for shares to re-rate higher 
as improved operating leverage translates to higher earnings growth. 
Valuation and risks 
Our $209 price target is based on 17.5x our 2019 EPS estimate, which is 
supported by our DCF framework (3.75% terminal growth and 7.9% WACC). 
Downside risks include a sharp decline in commodity prices, lower pricing, 
NAFTA, and recession.
