warranties with respect to the accuracy of any information that you report to the IRS or other taxing authorities, and, accordingly, disclaims any and all liability that may arise with respect to your use and reliance

Cost Basis on fixed income securities is adjusted for amortization, accretion or principal paydowns. The method of calculation is based upon the type of fixed income security and certain attributes, obtained from 
sources believed to be reliable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there may be a temporary incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the portfolio system is amended to reflect this 
change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those involving continuously callable bonds• foreign bonds• variable rates, bonds in default, index4inked bonds, bonds sold 
short or bonds that have a negative yield. This intonation is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns.

used to determine the cost basis for calculating gain and/or loss, unless another method was selected at the time of the security disposal, and this may be reported on the IRS Form 1099-8.
