• Noncovered under the cost basis rules as defined below. 
Securities acquired before 2011 or in retirement accounts are generally not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (1RC") (incorporating 
amendments enacted by P.L 110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are. therefore, considered "noncovered.' under the new cost basis reporting rules, and marked or denoted as such. 
Al other securities in this section are securities %filch are 'covered under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are "covered" under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as non-reteement, 
US taxpayers securities which have been acquired on or after their 'applicable date(sr at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis will be reported to the IRS on form 1999-6 
for the applicable tax year in which the security is disposed. 
Reporting requirements generally will be phased in over a three-year period, as follows: 
• 
Stock in a corporation acquired on or after January 1, 2011 
• 
Mutual funds and dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012 
• 
Options and any Debt Instruments that provide a simple feted payment schedule for which a yield to maturity can be easily determined acquired on or after January 1, 2014. 
Cost Basis on feted income securities may be adjusted for amortization, accretion, original issue discount adjustments, or principal paydowns. The calculation is based upon the taxpayer election, type of fixed 
income security, and certain attributes, obtained from sources believed to be reliable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there may be a temporary incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until 
the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those invoMng foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with less 
than one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns.
