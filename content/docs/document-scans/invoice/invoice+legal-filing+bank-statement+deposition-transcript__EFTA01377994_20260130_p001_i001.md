We are not obligated to pay dividends on our common stock, our Class B common stock or our Class C common stock. 
As a Delaware corporation, we will be subject to certain restrictions on dividends under the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL. Generally. a 
Delaware corporation may only pay dividends either out of "surplus" or out of the current or the immediately preceding years net profits. Surplus is defined as 
the excess, if any, at any given time, of the total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory capital. The value of a corporation's assets can 
be measured in a number of ways and may not necessarily equal their book value.
