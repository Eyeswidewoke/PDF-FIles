' Noncovered under the cost basis rules as defined below. 
Securities acquired before 2011 are generally not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ('IRC') (incorporating amendments enacted by 
P.L.110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are, therefore, considered" noncovered,' under the new cost basis reporting rules, and marked or denoted as such. All other securities in 
this section are securities which are 'covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are "covered" under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as securities which have been acquired 
on or after their 'applicable date(s)' at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis bill be reported to the IRS on form 109943 for the applicable tax year in which the security is 
disposed. 
Reporting requirements generally will be phased in over a three-year period, as folows: 
• 
Stock in a corporation acquired on or after January 1, 2011 
• 
Mutual funds and dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012 
• 
Cher securities, principally debt securities and options, acquied on or after January 1, 2014, or later, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities is adjusted for amortization, accretion or principal paydowns. The method of calculation is based upon the type of fixed income security and certain attributes, obtained from 
sources believed to be reliable. In the event, one or more of these attrbutes is changed, there may be a temporary incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the portfolio system is amended to reflect this 
change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those involving continuously callable bonds, foreign bonds, variable rates, bonds in default, index-linked bonds, bonds sold 
shod or bonds that have a negative yield. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns.

6 The Current Face value represents the outstanding principal balance of the underlying security. The Current Face value is determined by multiplying the current factor times the original face amount of the 
security. Factors may change over time and are obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. 
12 Pershing has received updated cost basis information, therefore cost basis provided on previous client brokerage statements may differ from the new cost basis reported in this section.
