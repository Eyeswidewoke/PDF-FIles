Lowering 1Q divi estimate by 38% to 30c; we're now 38% below 
consensus. Risk is that dividends may skew towards our bear case in 
2015-16 with APO largely through its harvesting mode. 
Near-term we see downside risk to APO shares with our 30c dividend 
estimate in 1Q that is 38% below consensus and 64% lower than 1Q14's 
84c div. Our 2015 dividend of 1.96c is 6% below consensus and we see 
downside risk of —36c if the cash performance fees held in Fund VI escrow are 
not released this year (we expect this is released in 4Q15, but if timing is 
pushed out then our 2015 divi declines to 1.60c which is 23% below 
consensus). While we see long-term value in APO, given the firm's strong track 
record of above average market returns, we think the stock will likely 
underperform peers over the next 12 months due to a declining cash earnings 
and dividend trajectory. Also see our 1Q Alts preview here: US Asset 
Managers: Summer of Realizations: Buy BX and CG into 1Q Earnings (01 
Apr 2015). 
34 divi expected to be the lowest since 2Q12. If this trend persists, there 
could be a disconnect between near-term share-price performance and 
longer-term fundamentals. APO's high dividend yield (9.6% currently on cons 
2015 divi) is a core part of the APO investment appeal in the short-term, until 
the outlook for cash earnings improves after another deployment cycle or 
incremental scaling of the credit business. We see downside risk to consensus 
dividend estimates and we're 6% below in 2015 (with downside bias to our 
estimate) and 13% below in 2016. 
No PE Monetizations Announced in 1Q: APO did not announce any PE exits 
in 1Q in which they can take cash carry. Yes APO exited Sprouts but that's held 
in the Fund VI escrow which is not released until the portfolio value exceeds 
115% of cost (last at 104% in 4Q and likely declines further in 1Q with the 
Sprouts exit). We're estimating 3c in cash carry for PE in 1Q as we bake in 
potential dividend recaps in portfolio companies. APO announced sales of Brit 
Insurance and Great Wolf in 1Q which we estimate could generate 21c of cash 
carry but we do not expect these to close until 2Q or 3Q. 
CNS Monitoring fee expired in 4Q, drops to zero in 1Q: this drives a 29% 
decline in credit mgmt fee revenues in 1Q15, worth 8c to EPS. We're relatively 
less concerned about this as it's been expected for some time now and does 
not impact cash earnings or the dividend... but presents headline risk to 
reported EPS.
