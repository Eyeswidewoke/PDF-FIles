Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual fund. Shares of a money 
market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds credited to your brokerage account. Please see the 
money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional information. Pursuant to SEC Rule 10b-10(b)(1) confirmations are 
not sent for purchases into money market mutual funds processed on the sweep platform. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-Insured Bank Deposits are not protected by Securities Investor Protection Cori>orahon(SIPC). 
For disclosure of rates for DWS money market funds, please visit the DWS Investments website at httpslAwnv.thers-investments.comEN/products/money-market-fundslields.jsp Please note that al money 
market funds listed on the website may not be offered through us. 
Please be advised that Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. will be aqui:toting the NY Tax Free Money Fund and Tax Free Money Fund Investment (the 'NY Tax Free Funds') and the Tax-Exempt 
California Money Markel Fund on or about April 8, 2016 and as such the NY Tax Free Funds and the Tax-Exempt Canfornia Money Market Fund will no longer be available as money market funds in the DBSI 
cash sweep program (the 'Sweep Program') 
What this means for you: 
If you are currently invested in the NY Tax Free Funds or the Tax-Exempt California Money Market Fund. your entire position in the applicable NY Tax Free Funds and Tax-Exempt California Money Markel Fund 
will be automatically redeemed and the proceeds will remain as cash balances in your brokerage account. For more information about your available cash sweep options and to select a new cash sweep option 
you must contact your Client Advisor. 
If you are not currently invested in the NY Tax Free Funds or the Tax-Exempt California Money Market Fund, then this change will not affect the existing sweep for your cash balances and you do not need to 
contact your Client Advisor.
