Securities acquired before 2011 are generally not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ('IRC') (incorporating amendments enacted by 
P.1.110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are, therefore, considered " noncovered,' under the new cost basis reporting rules, and marked or denoted as such. All other securities in 
this section are securities vitich are 'covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are "covered" under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as securities which have been acquired 
on or after their *appticable date(s)' at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis vii be reported to the IRS on form 1099.8 for the applicable tax year in which the security is

Messages 
Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at 51 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual fund. Shares of a money 
market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds credited to your brokerage account. Please see the 
money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional information.
