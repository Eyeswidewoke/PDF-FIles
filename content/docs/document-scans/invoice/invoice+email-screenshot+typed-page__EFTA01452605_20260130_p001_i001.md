A battleground valuation stock; 
initiating at Hold on higher risk profile 
Initiating coverage of KKR with a Hold rating and $25 PT 
We see KKR units trading in a range near current levels over the next 12 
months for the following reasons: 1) market debate around the merits of KKR's 
differentiated balance sheet strategy should remain intense, but should the 
equity markets be choppier in 2014 vs. 2013 (as is the case so far), we think 
KKR units will struggle to advance as investors avoid stocks with more volatile 
& market-dependent earnings, and 2) KKR's distributable earnings (DE) profile 
through 2015 looks okay to us, and in fact could be less volatile than peers, 
but we also do not see a major growth catalyst in DE, thus investors may 
focus more on downside risks, & 3) KKR units look attractive on a sum-of-
parts basis, but we see the heavier business mix toward principal income & 
capital markets as a weight on the PIE. Positively, KKR is executing well across 
each of its businesses, including generating strong organic growth, while 
using the balance sheet to both leverage its investing acumen and generating 
a higher recurring distributable earnings base (to be helped by KFN in '14). 
Ea, nings outlook 
We believe DE, from which cash distributions are paid to unit holders, is the 
most important earnings metric to value the Alts, rather than economic net 
income (ENI) that forms Consensus estimates. We forecast KKR's DE per unit 
to remain steady, from $2.01 in 2013 to $1.99 in 2014E and $2.09 in 2015E. 
Drivers are: 1) steady growth in realizations & 2) good AuM organic growth. 
Valuation 
s 
We think KKR units partially realize the benefit of the sum-of-parts debate and 
revalue up from 9.7x 2014E ENI to nearly 12x 2015E DE 12 months from now, 
narrowing its discount to the S&P 500 P/E from -40% to -.20%. This drives a 
$25 PT, near current levels, which implies a total return of 8% over the next 12 
months, inclusive of a 6.5% forecast distribution yield for 2014. Downside 
risks for KKR are: 1) a slowdown in US/global economy, 2) a prolonged equity 
market correction. & 3) failure for investors to embrace the balance sheet 
strategy & award KKR a higher P/E from its current discount vs. peers, and 4) 
substantial negative marks on the balance sheet if values of its holdings drops 
sharply. Upside risks are 1) much stronger DE than expected if KKR leverages 
its investment ideas effectively in balance sheet investments and 2) investors 
awarding KKR a much higher PE if balance sheet risks are perceived as low.
