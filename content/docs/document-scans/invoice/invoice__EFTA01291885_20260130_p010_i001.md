amendments enacted by P.L.110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are, therefore, considered "noncovered," under the new cost basis reporting rules, and marked or denoted as such. 
All other securities in this section are securities which are "covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are 'covered" under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as non-retiement, 
US taxpayers securities which have been acquired on or after their "applicable date(s)' at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis will be reported to the IRS on form 109943 
for the applicable tax year in which the security is disposed.

•

•

• 
Options and any Debt Instruments that provide a simple feted payment schedule for which a yield to maturity can be easily determined acquired on or alter January 1, 2014.
