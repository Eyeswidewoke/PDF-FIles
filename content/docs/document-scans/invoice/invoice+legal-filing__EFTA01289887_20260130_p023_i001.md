Schedule of Realized Gains and Losses Current Period (continued) 
Reporting requirements generally will be phased in over a three•year period, as follows: 
• 
Stock in a corporation acquired on or after January 1, 2011 
• 
Mutual funds and dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012 
• 
Options and any Debt Instruments that provide a simple fixed payment schedule for which a yield to maturity can be easily determined acquired on or after January 1, 2014. 
This Schedule may not reflect all cost basis adjustments necessary for tax reporting purposes, especially for noncovered securities. Adjustments to cost basis may have been made for prior income received and 
subsequently reclassified by the issuer as a return of capital. In addition, corporate action events may require adjustments to your original cost basis. Return of capital information and cost basis information, as 
it relates to corporate actions, has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. 
Adjustments to cost basis can be made after year-end, in particular, for return of capital adjustments, but may also include adjustments for corporate action events. Therefore there may be differences in cost 
basis reflected on your monthly client brokerage statement at year end versus any subsequent reports, including your 1099.8 or online displays you may have available to you. 
When you report your cost basis on your tax return, it should be verified using all of your own records. In particular, there may be other adjustments which you need to make, but are not required to be made by 
Pershing as it relates to N.R. 1424. You should consul with your tax advisor in order to properly report your gain or loss for tax purposes. Pershing shall not be responsible for and makes no representations or 
warranties with respect to the accuracy of any information that you report to the IRS or other taxing authormes, and, accordingly, disclaims any and all liability that may arise with respect to your use and rebance 
on the information provided herein for such reporting. 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities may be adjusted for amortation, accretion, original issue discount adjustments, or principal paydowns. The calculation is based upon the taxpayer election, type of fired 
income security, and certain attributes, obtained from sources believed to be relable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there may be a temporary Snorted adjusted cost basis reflected 
until the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These calculations wit not be performed under certain circumstances, including those involving foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with 
less than one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consul your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns. 
Please refer to the Your Account Information Section in your brokerage account statement for your accounts existing tax-lot disposition method. The disposition method is the method which you have selected to 
use in the disposal of each tax lot of the securities held in your account. If you do not select a method, your account will be defaulted to First In, Fist Out (FIFO). Your accounts selected tax lot method will be 
used to determine the cost basis for calculating gain andicir loss, unless another method was selected at the tine of the security disposal, and this may be reported on the IRS Form 1099-8.
