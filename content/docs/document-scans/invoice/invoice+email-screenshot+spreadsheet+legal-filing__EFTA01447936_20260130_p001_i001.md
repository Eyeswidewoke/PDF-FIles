Since the start of the quarter, revenue trends have been stronger-than- 
michaellinenbergedb.com 
expected. In May, Delta unit revenues increased 7%, at the high end of the 
company's +6% to 7% range (tightened higher from +5% to 7% in the 
Perna TO.-.&
beginning of May). That PRASM came in at the high end of the tightened 
Research Associate 
range could reflect better close in (i.e. business) bookings, in our view. Given 
0112122SO-9469 
that we are seeing similar trends across our US airline coverage universe, we 
richttalwarCeiThcom 
believe that we are not only seeing the benefits of consolidation, but that the 
macroeconomic backdrop is also improving. As such we are raising our June

Jet fuel should also proxrde a tailwind

In addition to the aforementioned strength in revenue trends, we have also 
catherine-m.o-brienedb.com 
seen jet fuel crack spreads narrow markedly over the past month and a half, 
providing a further boost to June Q earnings. Jet fuel spreads to Brent and 
Fixed Income 
WTI have decreased 34% and 2055 since mid-April, so while Brent and WTI are

trading at similar levels the price of jet fuel per gallon has fallen 4%. 
Raising June Ca, 2014, and 2015 oarninott 
We are raising our June O 2014 EPS estimate to $1.05 (vs. consensus of $1.02) 
from $1.00 as strong revenue and lower fuel prices are better-than-expected. 
We expect the revenue strength seen in the June Q to continue in the second 
half of 2014 and into 2015 as the benefits of the last round of consolidation 
provide better pricing power and the macro backdrop improves. As such, we 
are raising our 2014 and 2015 EPS estimate to $3.05 (vs. consensus of $3.04) 
from $2.85 and $3.55 (vs. consensus of $3.51) from $3.10, respectively. 
Valuation and f 
Given our improved earnings outlook and our belief that Delta merits a multiple 
Sane Dartach• &ant
slightly above the group's historical range given its continued efforts to de-risk 
the business and reward shareholders (plans to pay down an additional $2 
billion in net debt, increased dividend by 50%, and announced new $2 billion 
so 
share repurchase program during the June O), we are raising our price target 
40 
to $48 from S40. Our price target is derived by the application of a 13.5 PIE 
30 
multiple to our 2015 forecast, slightly above the group's historical 10x - 12x 
20 
range. Turning to risks, fuel price volatility is a key risk for Delta —we estimate 
to 
every 100/0 move in jet fuel (ceteris paribus) impacts our 2014 EPS forecast of 
$3.05 by $0.70. Other risks include economic weakness, government 
6113
regulation, labor issues, the threat of terrorism and war, and the revaluation of 
the stock market resulting in higher equity risk premiums for airline stocks.
