Noncovered under the cost basis rules as defined below. 
Securities acquired ',elm 2011 are generally not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ('IRC')(ncommating amendments enacted by 
P.L.110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2006) and are, therefore, considered " noncovered,' under the new cost basis reporting rules, and marked or denoted as such. All other securities in 
this section are securities which are 'covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are "covered" under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as securities which have been acquired 
on or after their 'applicable date(s)' at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis will be repotted to the IRS on form 1099-B for the applicable tax year in which the security is 
disposed. 
Reporting requirements generally will be phased in over a three-year period, as folows: 
• 
Stock in a corporation acquired on or after January 1, 2011 
• 
Mutual funds and dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012 
• 
Other securities. principally debt securities and options, acquired on or after January 1, 2014, or later, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities is adjusted for amortization, accretion or principal paydowns. The method of calculation is based upon the type of fixed income security and cerise, attributes, obtained from 
sources believed to be reliable. In the event, one or more of these attrioutes is changed, there may be a temporary incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the portfolio system is amended to reflect this
