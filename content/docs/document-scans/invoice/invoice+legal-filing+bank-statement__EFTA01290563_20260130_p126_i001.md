• Noncovered under the cost basis rules as defined below. 
Securities acquired before 2011 are generally not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ('IRC') (incorporating amendments enacted by 
P.L.110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are, therefore, considered "noncovered," under the new cost basis reporting ivies, and marked or denoted as such. Al other securities in this 
section are securities which are 'covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are "covered" under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as securities which have been acquired on 
or after their 'applicable date(s)' at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis will be reported to the IRS on form 1099.8 for the applicable tax year in which the security is 
disposed. 
Reporting requirements generally will be phased in over a three-year period, as follows: 
• 
Stock in a corporation acquired on or after January 1. 2011 
• 
Mutual funds and dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012 
• 
Other securities, principally debt securities and options, acquired on or after January 1, 2014, or later, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
This Schedule may not reflect all cost basis adjustments necessary for tax reporting purposes, especially for noncovered securities. Adjustments to cost basis may have been made for prior income received and 
subsequently reclassified by the issuer as a return of capital. In addition, corporate action events may require adjustments to your original cost basis. Return of capital information and cost basis information, as 
it relates to corporate actions. has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. 
Adjustments to cost basis can be made after year-end, in particular, for return of capital adjustments, but may also include adjustments for corporate action events. Therefore there may be differences in cost 
basis reflected on your monthly client brokerage statement at year end versus any subsequent reports, including your 1099-8 or online displays you may have availaWe to you.
