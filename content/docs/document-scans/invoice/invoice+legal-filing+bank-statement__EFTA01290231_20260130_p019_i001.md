Portfolio Holdings (continued) 
Securities acquired before 2011 or in retirement accounts are generally not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("IRC") (incorporating 
amendments enacted by P.L 110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are, therefore, considered snoncovered," under the new cost basis reporting rules, and marked or denoted as such. 
All other securities in this section are securities which are "covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are 'covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as non-retirement, 
US taxpayers securities which have been acquired on or after their "applicable date(s)' at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis will be reported to the IRS on form 109943 
for the applicable tax year in which the security is disposed. 
Reporting requirements generally will be phased in over a three-year period, as follows: 
• 
Stock M a corporation acquired on or after January 1, 2911 
• 
Mutual funds and dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012 
• 
Options and any Debt Instruments that provide a simple fixed payment schedule for which a yield to maturity can be easily determined acquired on or after January 1, 2014.
