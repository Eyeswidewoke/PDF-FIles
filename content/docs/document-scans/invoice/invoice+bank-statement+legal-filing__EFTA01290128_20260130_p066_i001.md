Securities acquired before 2011 are generally not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ('IRC') (incorporating amendments enacted by 
P.L.110-343. the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are, therefore, considered " noncovered." under the new cost basis reporting rules, and marked or denoted as such. All other securities in 
this section are securities which are 'covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are "covered" under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as securnies which have been acquired 
on or after their 'applicable datersr at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis vAl be reported to the IRS on form 1099-8 for the applicable tax year in which the security is 
disposed.

•
