change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those involving continuously callable bonds. foreign bonds. variable rates, bonds in default, index-linked bonds, bonds sold 
shod or bonds that have a negative yield. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns.
