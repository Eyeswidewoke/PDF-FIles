Receive a $50 TayiorMade Gift Card with 
Redemption! 
TaylorMade's most forgiving iron ever is engineered to help 
slower swingers launch the ball higher and carry it longer. 
The iron is ultra-forgiving on every type of ott-center hit and 
the wide beveled sole offers great playability while 
establishing a low CG. The generous offset helps straighten 
a slide and promote a distance-enhancing draw, and the 
low-profile long-iron design makes it easy to launch on a 
high, long, soft-landing flight. Redeem now and receive a 
$50 TaylorMade gift card!
