In brief, the allocation process Solves the following steps: 
> The number of trading units held in each account is identified. 
> A sequential number is assigned to each trading unit (e.g.. account EDR-567433 would be assigned six numbers). 
> A random number is generated that will result in one of these trading units being the first unit in the selection process. 
> Thereafter, the trading units participating in the allocation are based on an incremental random number technique until the number of trading units allocated to Pershing is exhausted. 
Additional Information 
The allocation of called securities is not made on a pro-rata basis. Therefore, it is possible that a client may receive a full or partial redemption of shares held. Conversely, it is also possible that a client may not 
have any secunties selected for redemption at all. 
ripen a partial call is deemed favorable to the holders of the called security, Pershing will exclude certain accounts from the lottery. Excluded accounts wil include Pershing's proprietary and employee accounts, 
as wel as proprietary and employee accounts of introducing broker-dealers (if Pershing carries and clears those accounts) No allocation will be made to these proprietary and employee accounts until all other 
client positions at Pershing in such securities have been called. When a partial cal is deemed unfavorable to holders of the called security, Pershing will not exclude any accounts from the lottery. 
If the partial cal is made at a price above the current market price as captured in Pershing's price reporting system, Pershing will generally categorize the partial call as one that is favorable to the holders of such 
security. If the partial cal is made at a price that is equal to or below the current market price of the security as captured n Pershing's price reporting system, Pershing will generally categorize that cal as one 
that is unfavorable to holders of the secunty. 
Clients have the right to withdraw uncalled, fully paid securities from Pershing at any time prior to the cutoff date and time established by the issuer, transfer agent and/or depository with respect to the partial cal. 
Clients also have the right to withdraw excess margin securities, provided that the client account is not subject to restriction under Regulation T or that such withdrawal will not cause an under-margined condition.
