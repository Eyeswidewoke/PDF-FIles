ED Deutsche Lufthansa — Anand Date, BUY, close €30.7, €36.2 tgt, 18% upside 
■ The Air Berlin acquisition is an excellent deal. >50% of Air Berlin flown 
capacity on routes where Lufthansa + Air Berlin would have combined 80-
100% market share, creating capacity and revenue management 
opportunities. 
- The combined group would have a number of strong positions at 
severely and slightly constrained airports. Our August 2017 note 
("Finding a sweet slot") highlighted the benefits of such positions, in 
terms of network flexibility, better pricing power and tangible slot value. 
■ Airline M&A has historically been highly accretive, generally yielding 
synergies of 3-7% of combined revenues (3/4 revenue, 1/4 cost). 
■ Lufthansa is not inheriting legacy costs, only purchasing assets at 
market rates. It has guided that the deal should reduce unit costs. 
■ We see a ROCE of 25-35% on a three year view based on a E1.5bn 
investment in the deal. 
■ The market is not reflecting this in forecasts. We forecast incremental 
EBIT of €470m by 2019, leaving us 22% ahead of consensus. 
■ Antitrust risk is limited: 1) Lufthansa is providing much of Air Berlin bridge
