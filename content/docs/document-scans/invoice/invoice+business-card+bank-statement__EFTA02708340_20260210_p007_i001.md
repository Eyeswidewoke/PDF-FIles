Management 
ood management of the property is essential and 
pi
we have a first class team who keep you updated 
on a daily basis. Its remit is as follows: 
• Make regular external inspections to ensure the property 
and its grounds are in good condition 
• Ensure that the tenants are still in residence and report 
any irregularities 
• Make regular internal inspections to ensure the fabric 
of the buildings remain in good condition 
• Respond to emergency call outs from the tenants 
• Attend to any repairs and/or replacements necessary. 
If there is a change in tenant, an immediate search for a new 
tenant will be initiated. The loss of rent and the costs of finding 
a new tenant are protected by our guarantee. The cost of repairs 
and dilapidations are, as specified earlier, not covered. 
Collection of rent 
ur administrative team will be responsible for the 
LI
0 
monthly rent collection and the bookkeeping. Your 
secure on-line portal will keep you up to date. 
Changes of tenancy, defaulting tenants and other problems will 
be dealt with immediately to ensure that any income disruption 
is minimized. The 12% guarantee protects you from these 
eventualities for the first two years. US law is also firmly on the 
side of the owner in the case of tenants defaulting on payments. 
Personal tax 
he personal tax position will vary 
depending on your status and country 
of residence. For example, if you are 
investing as an individual or as a corporate 
entity. The US has reciprocal tax agreements 
with most countries so that the tax taken 
by the US is credited against your personal 
tax liability in your country of residence. 
As a foreign investor you only get taxed on your 
income earned and assets held in the USA. It does 
not apply to any income earned or assets held 
outside the USA unless you are a US citizen. 
We can provide general advice and introduce 
you to specialists who can help. 
Escrow account 
hen we create a portfolio for a 
ka
client an Escrow account is opened 
for that portfolio in the name of 
the investor and a sum deposited by Real 
Time Investments to the value of 12% of 
the purchase price of each property. Your 
account is reviewed after 12 months and any 
shortfall in the actual net rental income is 
made up to 12% from the Escrow account.

REDFORD 
Wayne County 
Redford (pop. 51,622) is the 
arguably the prettiest suburb 
of Metro Detroit. The Rouge 
River meanders through 
it fringed by parkland, a 
stunning display of colour 
in the fall. It is said Redford 
reflects the face of America: 
a population of all ages, races 
and religious backgrounds. 
It is a residential area 
providing a workforce for 
the surrounding commercial 
and industrial enterprises.
