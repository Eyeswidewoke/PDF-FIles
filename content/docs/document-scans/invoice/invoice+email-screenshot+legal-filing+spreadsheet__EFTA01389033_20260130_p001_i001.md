Demand in not dead, in fact it is very 
much alive 
CEO transition mars an otherwise perfectly fine quarier 
With sentiment turning negative, the market appears to be searching for 
reasons to sell and CONE's unexpected CFO transition provided a reason in 30. 
While the prior CFO's short tenure raises questions, we think liquidity is in 
great shape with no need to raise equity any time soon, which should help in a 
smooth transition. Op results in the la were also a positive. While the $27MM 
of 30 bookings fell short of the last 3 Os, it was CONE's 4th best ever and the 
outlook was about as positive as we've heard (sales funnel 2x the 20 level). 
Also, though churn will be above trend in '16, the '17 outlook calls for 
improvement to the low end of the historical guidance range. Reiterate Buy. 
Leasing activity and pipeline reflective of strong demand 
CONE signed a respectable $27MM of annualized GAAP revenue (inc. $14MM 
reported with 20 results). While this was below the level achieved in the last 3 
quarters it was the 4th best print on record and does not include another 
25kcsf in early 40 which we estimate will add -$4MM annually. New lease 
rent/KW came in at $126 vs. the prior 4 0 avg of $147, given the previously-
announced wholesale pre-leasing activity announced in NoVA. Excluding this 
activity• bookings over the balance of 30 averaged $197/KW. Total utilization 
was 85%, while the stabilized rate was 93%, both 100bps higher than 20. 
Churn of 3.8% was higher than recent quarters, and included 1.4% proactively 
taken back by CONE, although it was in-line with the 2H outlook. Initial 2017 
commentary suggests a reversion back to about 6% churn. 
Updating etaintares folk/vying s() earnings 
We have updated our model to reflect 30 results, revised guidance, and our 
updated outlook. Our 2016 normalized FFO/sh estimate moves to $2.60 from 
$2.56, FAD/sh moves to $2.22 from $2.44, and adjusted EBITDA moves to 
$274.9MM from $275.3MM. For 2017, normalized FFO/sh moves to $2.96 
from $2.95, FAD/sh moves to $2.80 from $2.90, and adjusted EBITDA moves 
to $339.2MM from $337.7MM. Our FFO estimates increase to reflect updated 
run-rates and one-time items, while FAD falls on higher straight line rent. 
Valuation cox( risks 
We are lowering our TP to $57 from $59. Our TP is based on a 50:50 blend of 
our FAD-based target and our EBITDA-based target. Risks include the success 
of CONE's dev efforts, heightened operating risk vs. peers in light of higher 
tenant and geo concentration, and higher SG&A business model.
