Long-term hospital opportunity and 
attractive relative value: Initiate at Buy

We believe MPW represents an attractive long-term consolidation play in the 
hospital space, given its industry expertise, discounted relative value and 
healthy 6% dividend. We think the institutionalization of the hospital real estate 
market is poised to accelerate, driven by positive industry trends, increased 
comfort with the sale/leaseback model, not-for-profit to for-profit conversions, 
and managed care consolidation that could spur additional hospital 
consolidation activity. As the only pure play in the hospital space, we believe 
MPW stands to benefit the most from these positive trends. With a 15% total 
expected return, including a 6% dividend yield, we are initiating with a Buy. 
Long-term tailwinds and atti active relative value 
Our positive long-term bias is based on 1) the attractive long-term roll-up 
opportunity. 2) potential acceleration of acquisition activity, 3) highly stable 
and visible cash flows, 4) solid hospital industry trends, and 5) the potential for 
a re-rating of the shares as investors become more comfortable with the 
hospital sector overall. We fully recognize that the path to realizing MPW's 
embedded value will be difficult to measure quarter-to-quarter as acquisitions 
are difficult to project and lumpy by nature, but we see the potential for 
significant value creation overtime. 
Normalization of relative value drives our TP; dividend protects the downside 
MPW currently trades at wider-than-historical FFO and AFFO multiple 
discounts versus its smaller-cap Healthcare REIT peers. However, we think 
there are several reasons why MPW should, at a minimum, trade in line with 
historical relative valuations including: 1) prospective earnings upside from 
accretive acquisitions; 2) VTR's entry into the hospital space, which should 
drive greater price transparency and awareness; and 3) substantial improve-
ments in the scale/diversification of MPW's business versus history. We see 
downside protection stemming from MPW's well-covered 6% dividend yield. 
Valuation and eisl:s 
Our TP of $17 per share equates to a 15% expected return including the 6% 
dividend yield. Our TP is based on a 14.3x our 2017 FAD estimate of $1.19. Our 
multiple assumption is rich by historical standards, but not relative to the 
record low rate environment, and is a 3.5x discount to peers, which is roughly 
in line with the five-year average. Key risks include: 1) interest rate sensitivity, 
2) above-average government reimbursement risk, 3) above-average tenant 
concentration risk, 4) FX and geographic risk given MPW's European exposure, 
5) less-robust disclosures vs peers, and 6) healthcare regulatory risks.
