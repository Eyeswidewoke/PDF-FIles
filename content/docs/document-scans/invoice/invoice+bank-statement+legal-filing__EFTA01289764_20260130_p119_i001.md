Securities acquired before 2011 are generally not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ('IRO (incorporating amendments enacted by 
P.L.110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are, therefore, considered " noncovered,' under the new cost basis reporting rules, and marked or denoted as such. All other securities in 
this section are securities which are 'covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are 'covered" under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as securities which have been acquired

disposed.

sources believed to be reliable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there may be a temporary incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the portfolio system is amended to reflect this 
change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances. including those involving continuously callable bonds, foreign bonds, variable rates, bonds in default, index-inked bonds, bonds sold 
short or bonds that have a negative yield. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns.
