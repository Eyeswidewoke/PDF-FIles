Alternatives 
Our view of non-traditional asset classes 
Alternatives portfolios 
Due to their distinct characteristics, we take a 
differentiated look at selected liquid and illiquid 
alternative investments. 
Liquid alternatives 
a Equity long/short 
The performance of equity-long/short strategies year-to-date has 
reflected two market dynamics over this period. Firstly, value 
has underperformed momentum for the majority of the year 
which has hindered the performance of managers' long book. 
Secondly, small caps have marginally underperformed large caps 
ahead of the turning of the rate cycle in the United States and 
equity-long/short managers generically operating with net long 
exposure tend to fish in mid and small caps where they believe 
alpha can be more easily captured. Looking forward we believe 
that exposure to low-net-exposure equity strategies particularly 
in the United States will allow investors to generate uncorrelated 
returns with less volatility and better downside protection. From 
a macro perspective we believe that expansionary ECG monetary 
policy coupled with continued weakness in the euro should 
provide support for profit growth within Europe. 
Event-driven 
Event-driven strategies have underperformed year-to-date 
particularly soft-catalyst approaches where popular long names 
sold off over the summer. In addition the underperformance of 
value in markets has hurt the performance of activist strategies. 
On the positive side strong corporate balance sheets in the 
United States which are flush with cash and the search for 
growth through acquisition are two of a number of driving 
elements behind the near-record U.S.-dollar volume in mergers-
and-acquisitions (M&A) activity recorded year-to-date. In light 
of that, we continue to favor small and agile funds with an M&A 
focus and tight risk-management frameworks.

a Private equity 
U.S. private-equity markets remain active, with valuations at or 
near 2007 levels, bolstered by continued interest from strategic 
buyers as well as financial buyers sitting on large amounts of 
"dry powder' (capital available for investments). Debt availability 
is still strong. Total U.S. investment however dropped slightly 
in the third quarter from second-quarter levels. Private-equity 
markets in Europe have also continued to perform well, with 
fundraising for the first three quarters already surpassing the 
2014 total. Price and leverage levels have moved close to their 
2007 peaks. European exit markets have also been very buoyant 
with 2015 on track to be a record year. By contrast, economic 
uncertainty in Asia is expected to significantly slow down 
private-equity activity in this region although recent corrections 
in the public equity market may offer some interesting 
investment opportunities.
