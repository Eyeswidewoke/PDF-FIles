Estimated Annual Figures 
The estimated annual income (EAI) and estimated annual yield (MY) figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. These figures are not considered to be a forecast or 
guarantee of future results. These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable; however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest 
and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making 
investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant. A capital gain or return of principal 
may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to www.pershing.com/ disclosuresfor specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. 
Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received.

have been reinvested. You will not receive confirmation of these reinvestments. Upon written request to your financial institution, information pertaining to these transactions, 
including the time of execution and the name of the person from whom your security was purchased, may be obtained. In dividend reinvestment transactions, Pershing acts as your 
agent and receives payment for order flow.

Information with respect to commissions and other charges incurred in connection with the execution of option transactions has been included in confirmations previously furnished 
to you. A summary of this information is available to you promptly upon your written request directed to your introducing firm. In order to assist your introducing firm in maintaining 
current background and financial information concerning your option accounts, please promptly advise them in writing of any material change in your investment objectives or

organization may also increase the currency conversion rate. This conversion rate may differ from rates in effect on the date you executed a transaction, incurred a charge, or
