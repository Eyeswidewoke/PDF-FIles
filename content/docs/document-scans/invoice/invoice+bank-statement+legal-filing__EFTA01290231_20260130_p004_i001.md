Portfolio Holdings (continued) 
Securities acquired before 2011 or in retirement accounts are generally not subject to the new cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("IRC") (incorporating 
amendments enacted by P.L 110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and are, therefore, considered 'noncovered," under the new cost basis reporting rules, and marked or denoted as such. 
All other securities in this section are securities which are "covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules. Securities which are 'covered' under the new cost basis reporting rules are defined as non-retirement, 
US taxpayers securities which have been acquired on or after their "applicable date(s)' at which they are subject to the cost basis reporting rules and the adjusted basis will be reported to the IRS on form 1099-6 
for the applicable tax year in which the security is disposed. 
Reporting requirements generally will be phased in over a three-year period, as follows: 
• 
Stock in a corporation acquired on or after January 1, 2011 
• 
Mutual funds and dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) shares acquied on or after January 1, 2012 
• 
Options and any Debt Instruments that provide a simple fixed payment schedule for which a yield to maturity can be easily determined acquired on or after January 1, 2014. 
13 The cost basis of this security has been provided to us by the delivering firm or transferring agent and Pershing makes no representation as to the accuracy of this information. 
Messages 
Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual fund. Shares of a money 
market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds credited to your brokerage account Please see the 
money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional information. Pursuant to SEC Rule 10b-10(b)(1) confirmations are 
not sent for purchases into money market mutual funds processed on the sweep platform. 
The U.S. will adopt a shortened settlement timeframe beginning with trade date September 6 2017. for equities, corporate and municipal bonds, and unit investment trusts. Moving from a T+3 to ail-2 settlement 
cycle will provide faster access to sale proceeds, but it also means that funds wil be due on purchase transactions earlier. This may be a good time to consider e-delivery of your account documents-including 
trade confirmations, account statements and more. Ask your advisor about how you can set up e-delivery.
