without the adverse U.S. tax consequences typical of 
offshore investments. Moreover, the client's portfolio 
should be sheltered from U.S. taxation during his stay in

Retirement Planning 
Many clients, especially business owners, are subject 
to qualified plan limitations and can't put as much as 
they would like into tax-deferred retirement vehicles. 
These clients could use a PPVA investment account as 
a simple, yet effective, tax-deferred savings vehicle. The 
tax-deferred accumulation allows the PPVA account

to generate substantial incremental retirement income 
relative to a taxable investment account. 
"Optimizing Retirement Income," this page, shows 
how much more can be withdrawn each year from a 
retirement account allowed to accumulate for different 
periods. When allowed to accumulate for 20 years, a 
PPVA investment account allows a client to withdraw 
almost 50 percent more per year for 20 years than a tax-
able account. 
Practice tip: Consider allocating the most tax-ineffi-
cient segment of a client's portfolio to the PPVA invest-
ment account. This will optimize the leverage derived 
from deferring the investment gains from current period 
taxation. The PPVA provides significant flexibility in 
managing a client's retirement income, because sched-
uled withdrawals can be postponed or accelerated as 
needed. If the PPVA investment account values arc 
allocated to alternative asset class investment vehicles, 
careful planning is necessary to assure that the required

Foundations with UBT Investments

classes that are deemed to be active business interests, 
rather than passive investments. These asset classes gen-
erally generate UBTI; for example. timber, certain types 
of real estate, energy transportation and master limited 
partnerships, which can create current tax liabilities and 
even endanger the charitable entities tax-exempt status.
