dbAccess Asia Conference 2015 
Highlights 
More on the O2O foray 
Baidu mgmt covered a series of topics at dbAccess Asia 2015, ranging from 
the competitive landscape to its ongoing O2O thrust. The co seems committed 
to broadening its beachhead in O2O, viewing it as a largely under-penetrated 
and highly fragmented market with enormous opportunity. We expect Baidu to 
leverage subsidies aggressively to acquire and retain customers. We believe 
the co has slated RMB5bn in O2O related investments in FY15. Investment 
scale next year will depend on "market dynamics." 
Search business update: confident in mobile dominance despite verticals 
We believe that Baidu continues to command a 70% search market share in 
terms of traffic. While the PC-to-mobile transition has posed challenges, it also 
presents unprecedented opportunities, demanding aggressive advances in 
technology. Looking forward to next 3-5 years, both voice search and image 
search should contribute 50% of queries, likely explaining why Baidu is 
burrowing further into cutting-edge R&D to maintain its leading position. 
Margin outlook. committed to further gains in O2O; SG&A to rise sharply 
In addition to RMB5b in O2O related investment in FY15, content cost should 
grow at a similar pace as last year and TAC cost as % of rev should also be in 
line with last year. With many peers paying for app preinstall this year, Baidu is 
likely to continue to invest in pre-installs to stay competitive.

Maintain TP and Buy

expected product development and branding investments.
