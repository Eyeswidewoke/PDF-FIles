This Schedule may not reflect all cost basis adjustments necessary for tax reporting p.rposes. especially for noncovered securities. Adjustments to cost basis may have been mane for prior income received and 
subsequently reclassified by the issuer as a return of capital. In addition, corporate action events may require adjustments to your original cost basis. Return of capital information and cost basis information, as 
it relates to corporate actions, has been obtained from sources we beieve to be reliable. 
Adjustments to cost basis can be made after year-end, in particular, for return of capital adjustments. but may also include adjustments for corporate action events. Therefore there may be differences in cost 
basis reflected on your monthly client brokerage statement at year end versus any subsequent reports, including your 1099-B or online displays you may have available to you. 
When you report your cost basis on your tax return, it should be verified using all of your own records. In particular, there may be other adjustments which you need to make. but are not required to be made by 
Pershing as it relates to H.R. 1424. You should consult with your tax advisor in order to properly report your gain or loss for tax purposes. Pershing shall not be responsible for and makes no representations or 
warranties with respect to the accuracy of any information that you report to the IRS or other taxing authorities, and, accordingly, disclaims any and all liability that may arise with respect to your use and reliance 
on the information provided herein for such reporting.

change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances. including those invoking continuously callable bonds, foreign bonds, variable rates, bonds in default. index4inked bonds. bonds sold 
shod or bonds that have a negative yield. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns.
