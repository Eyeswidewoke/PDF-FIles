change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those involving continuously callable bonds, foreign bonds, variable rates, bonds in default, index-inked bonds, bonds sold 
short or bonds that have a negative yield. This intonation is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns.
