Manager Initiation 
Strong Cyclical and Secular Trends 
Should Drive More Outperformance 
lu nit ilia Cover 3ge of the Alzeinative Asset Managers, BX i:, top pick 
We initiate coverage of 5 alternative asset managers (the "Alts") with Buys on 
Blackstone (BX), Carlyle Group (CG), & Oaktree Capital (OAK) & Hold ratings on 
Apollo Global Mgmt (APO) & KKR & Co (KKR). Overall, these Alts are well-
positioned amid favorable cyclical tailwinds & strong secular dynamics, while 
valuations remain attractive. We favor the more-diversified Alts possessing less 
earnings variability & good distributable earnings (DE) growth profiles for 2014-
2015; this dynamic favors BX & CG over APO & KKR for now, in our view, & we 
see 4Q earnings as a positive catalyst upon a better DE outlook for next 1-2 
years. We also like OAK's more-traditional asset manager business profile. 
Valuations still attracti -e as debate on valuing the Alts continues 
With volatile and less predictable earnings, the market has been reluctant to 
assign a comparable traditional asset manager P/E on the Alts' carried interest 
income stream, which accounted for over half of Alt's pretax income over the 
past 2 years. However, we see limitations in this legacy sum-of-parts valuation 
approach (valuing fee-earnings at much higher multiples than carried interest) 
primarily because of the longer-term reliability of carried interest converting 
into cash distributions for public unit holders. Thus, we prefer to value the Alts 
on longer-term 'distributable earnings' (DE), which is a proxy for cash flow and 
the basis for cash distributions to unit holders. On this approach, we think 
these 5 Alt managers can trade at a median 12-13x P/E on our 2015 DE 
forecasts, a year from now, which implies about 2 points of multiple expansion 
and over 15% price appreciation, and about 22% total return inclusive of 
median 6-7% distribution yields at current price levels. 
Both cyciEf.ili and 
themee-, are .ter? posit :,e 
In the current economic/capital markets cycle, the Alts are likely to increasingly 
benefit from realizing the value of their long-term investments (from sales via 
M&A, IP0s, etc.) and distributing more cash to unit holders over 2014-15. 
Thus, we see a greater convergence of DE and the more volatile mark-to-
market-driven economic net income (ENI), as the realization cycle gains 
momentum in 2014. Asset organic growth rates should remain healthy as 
strong investment performance track records enable fundraising to outpace 
outflows from realized distribution to LPs. Key secular trends favoring Alts are 
1) rising allocations globally to alternative assets by institutions, and 
increasingly, individuals, 2) a major competitive advantage in ability to 
generate patient capital and invest long-term and influence investment 
outcomes, 3) a greater role for Alts in financing, creating more capital 
deployment opportunities globally, & 4) increasing concentration of asset flows 
to the largest Alts, which favors these 5 stocks. 
These stocks have above-average risk profiles 
With greater leverage to economy & capital markets, the stocks should 
maintain higher betas vs. traditional asset managers. Key risks are: 1) a 
downturn in the US & global economy and market prices, 2) a major slowdown 
in capital deployment that could cause 2015 earnings to peak out, 3) an 
inability to narrow P/E gap vs. traditional managers given inherent earnings 
volatility and complicated financial structures & modeling, and 4) speculation 
of greater regulatory scrutiny and/or higher taxation on carried interest and/or 
the Alts' income within their partnership structures.
