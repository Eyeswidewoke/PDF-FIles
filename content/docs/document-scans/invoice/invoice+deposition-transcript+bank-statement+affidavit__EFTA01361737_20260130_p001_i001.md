Pershing's Impartial Lottery Process: Partial Calls 
Information about Pershing's impartial lottery process can be found on pershing.corrilbusiness_continuity. You may also request a printed copy of this information by calling (888) 367-2563. option 3 then option 5. 
When a security is subject to a partial redemption, pursuant to FINRA Rule 4340, Pershing must have procedures in place that are designed to treat clients fairly in accordance with an impartial lottery process. 
When an issuer initiates a partial call of securities, the depository holding such securities (typically, the Depository Trust Clearing and Corporation, or DTCC) conducts an impartial, computerized lottery using an 
incremental random number technique to determine the allocation of called securities to participants for which it holds securities on deposit (including Pershing). Because DTC's lottery is random and impartial, 
participants may or may not receive an allocation of securities selected for redemption.
