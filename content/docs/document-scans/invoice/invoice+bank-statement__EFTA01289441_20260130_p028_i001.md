Noncovered under the cost basis rules as defined below. 
Generally, securities acquired before 2011, in retirement accounts or held by Non-US. entities are not subject to the cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and are marked as 'noncovered". Securities marked as "covered', were identified as securities potentially 
subject to the cost basis reporting rules and may be reported to the IRS on form 1399-8 for the applicable tax year in which the securities are disposed. 
Note: In the event where we cannot easily determine the taxability of an account, we may mark the account as noncovered. However, if the account does not receive a 10998, the cost 
basis will not be reported to the IRS. 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities may be adjusted for amortization, accretion, original issue discount adjustments, or principal paydowns. The calculation is based upon the 
taxpayer election, type of fixed income security, and certain attributes, obtained from sources believed to be reliable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there may 
be a temporary incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These calculations will not be performed under certain 
circumstances, including those involving foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with less than one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and you 
should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns. 
3 The cost basis of this security has been provided fo us by you or your introducing firm and Pershing makes no representation as fo the accuracy of this information. 
12 Pershing has received updated cost basis information, therefore cost basis provided on previous client brokerage statements may differ from the new cost basis reported in this section. 
The cost basis of this security has been provided fo us by the delivering firm or transferring agent and Pershing makes no representation as to the accuracy of this information.
