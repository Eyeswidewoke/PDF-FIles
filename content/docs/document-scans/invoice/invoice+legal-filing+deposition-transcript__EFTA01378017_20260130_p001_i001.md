effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to non-taxable contingent consideration fair value adjustments and non-
taxable foreign currency exchange gains. 
At December 31. 2013 and 2014. we had unrecognized tax benefits, including interest. of $12.4 million and $12.1 milkm, respectively. Included in 
unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013 and 2014, is approximately $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for tax positions included in MC's 
consolidated tax return filings. Unrecognized tax benefits. including interest. for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $0.3 million due principally 
to foreign statute expirations. If unrecognized tax benefits at December 31. 2014 are subsequently recognized. $11.8 million, net of related deferred tax assets 
and interest, would reduce income tax expense. The comparable amount as of December 31, 20131s $12.0 million. We believe that it is reasonably possible 
that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $1.2 million by December 31, 2015, primarily due to expirations of statutes of limitations.
