ing, varying, reducing or otherwise affecting or purporting to amend, vary, reduce or otherwise affe 
et, any of the obligations of the Obligor under the Master Agreement or of the Guarantor under this 
Guaranty or by any other circumstance (other than complete, irrevocable payment) that might otherwis 
e constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or a guarantor. This Guaranty sha 
11 be reinstated if at any time (including any time after its termination or expiration) any payment 
by the Obligor, in whole or in part, is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Bank upon th 
e insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Obligor or otherwise, all as though that payment h 
ad not been made. 
(f) 
This is a continuing Guaranty and all obligations to which it applies or may apply u 
nder the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. If th 
e Guarantor gives the Bank written notice of its intention to terminate its obligations under this G 
uaranty, the notice shall operate to terminate those obligations in respect of all Transactions whos 
e Trade Dates occur on or after the termination date specified in the notice; provided however that 
no such notice shall have any effect unless the termination date stated in it occurs at least ten Bu 
siness Days after the date the notice is effective. A notice given in accordance with this provision 
shall not affect the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty in respect of Transactions wh 
ose Trade Date occurs before the termination date stated in the notice. 
(g) 
If any amount payable by the Guarantor hereunder is not paid as and when due, the Gu 
arantor authorizes the Bank to proceed, without prior notice, by right of set-off, counterclaim or o 
therwise, against any assets of the Guarantor that may at the time be in the possession of the Bank 
at any branch or office, to the full extent of all amounts payable to the Bank hereunder. 
(h) Except as otherwise required by law, each payment required to be made by the Guarantor t 
o the Bank hereunder shall be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of Taxes. If 
such deduction or withholding is so required, the Guarantor shall (i) pay the amount required to be 
deducted or withheld to the appropriate authorities before penalties attach thereto or interest accr 
ues thereon, (ii) promptly forward to the Bank an official receipt evidencing such payment (or a cer 
tified copy thereof), and (iii) in the case of any such deduction or withholding, forthwith pay to t 
he Bank such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received b 
y the Bank free and clear of such Taxes, including any Taxes on such additional amount, is equal to 
the amount that the Bank would have received had there been no such deduction or withholding. 
(1) 
The provisions of Section 8 of the Master Agreement shall apply to amounts payable u 
nder this Guaranty as fully as if they were set forth in and referred to this Guaranty. 
2. 
Representations and Warranties. The Guarantor makes the representations and warrant 
ies set forth in subsections (a) through (c) and (e) of Section 3 of the Master Agreement to the Ban 
k on such basis and as if the references therein to the Master Agreement were references to this Gua 
ranty. The Guarantor also represents and warrants to the Bank that any certificates relating to the 
Guarantor to be delivered pursuant to Section 4 of the Agreement are true, accurate and complete in 
every material respect as of the dates of the certificates, and that any financial information to be 
provided pursuant to that Section fairly presents the financial condition of the Guarantor as at th 
e dates at which the financial information is stated to apply and the results of the operations of t 
he Guarantor for the applicable periods. The immediately preceding representation shall be deemed re 
peated each time such financial information is delivered pursuant to the Master Agreement. 
3. 
Covenants. (a) On or prior to the date hereof, the Guarantor shall deliver to the 
Bank an opinion letter substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto. 
(b) So long as the Obligor has any obligation to the Bank of a kind described in Section 1 
of this Guaranty, the Guarantor agrees that: 
(i) 
It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect all consents 
of any governmental or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this 
Agreement and will use all reasonable efforts to obtain any that may become necessary in the future; 
(ii) 
It will comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and orders to which 
it may be subject if failure so to comply would materially impair its ability to perform its oblige 
tions under this Agreement and; 
(iii) 
It will perform any agreements set forth in Section 4 of the Master Agreement with r 
espect to the Guarantor for the benefit of the Bank as if the Guarantor were a party to the Master A 
greement and references therein to the Master Agreement were references to this Guaranty. 
4. 
Subrogation. 
So long as any amount payable by the Obligor under the Master Agreeme 
nt is overdue and unpaid, the Guarantor shall not (i) exercise any right of subrogation or indemnity 
, or similar right or remedy, against the Obligor or any of its assets or property in respect of any 
amount paid by the Guarantor under this Guaranty or (ii) file a proof of claim in competition with 
the Bank for any amount owing to the insolvency or liquidation of the Obligor. If at any time when a 
ny such amount is overdue and unpaid the Guarantor receives any amount as a result of any action aga 
inst the Obligor or any of its property or assets or otherwise for or on account of any payment made 
by the Guarantor under this Guaranty, the Guarantor shall forthwith pay that amount received by it 
to the Bank, to be credited and applied against the amount so payable by the Obligor 
5. 
Successions or Assignments. 
(a) This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of the s 
uccessors or assigns of the Bank who shall have, to the extent of their interest, the rights of the 
Bank hereunder; provided, however, that the rights of the Bank hereunder, if any be retained by it,
