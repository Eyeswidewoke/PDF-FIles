This=is a draft of the certified letter to Mr. Diaz that Darren wrote with my m=nor edits. Please let me know if this is 
fine to send to him. 
<=iv id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466521480377_38770"> 
Dear Mr. D=az: 
=nbsp; 
&nb=p; As I emailed you on Friday, April 8, 2016, I repeatedly called you all last we=k, leaving you 
numerous voice mail messages, as well as messages with your administrative assistant. Failing to receive any response, I 
also left a message for Mr. Jeffers and requested t=at that he forward that message to you. Mr. Jeffers has subsequently 
confirmed that he passed on the message however, you have yet to respond.Consequently, I am writing this letter to 
formally demand the immediate return to LSJE, LLC of $114,540.53 previou=ly paid to and unlawfully retained by Better 
Roads for work that has never bee= performed by Better Roads on Little St. James. 
=nbsp; 
&nb=p; No representative of LSJE, LLC or Little St. James has ever signed any written agreement entitling 
Better Roads to charge any cancellation fee for work th=t has not been performed on Little St. James; nor has Better 
Roads at any tim= ever presented any representative of LSJE, LLC or Little St. James with a proposed contract that 
provides for the payment to Better Roads of such a cancellation fee. Moreover, no Better Roads representative has ever 
previously advised any representative of LSJE= LLC or Little St. James, either verbally or in writing, of any such 
cancellation fee, and there is simply no applicable statute or rule of law =hat authorizes Better Roads to charge or retain 
any such a cancellation fee.=nbsp; Better Roads' attempts to retain $76,875 as a cancellation fee, in addition to the 
$56,292.80 which it asserts as its cos=s on a project that it barely commenced and never completed, are therefore 
completely unlawful and entirely improper. 
=nbsp; 
&nb=p; In the hopes of amicably resolving any disagreements between Better Roads and LSJE, LLC, the 
assertion by Better Roads that it has expended $56,292.80 on work performed on Little St. James to date has not as yet 
been challenged b= WE, LLC. However, should Better Roads refuse to return the remaining $114,540.53 of the total 
$170,833.33 which L=JE, LLC previously paid it, then LSJE, LLC shall have no choice but to pursue Better Roads legally for 
all moneys previously paid to Better Roads.&nbsr; In that event, Better Roads will surely expend will in excess of 
$76,875 and face the loss of the additional $56,292.80 it=has retained in a futile effort to hold onto a cancellation fee for 
which there=is absolutely no contractual or legal support whatsoever. 
=nbsp; 
&nb=p; As I stated in my email to you, we are very disappointed with how this transac=ion has been 
handled to date, but are providing you with a last effort to see r=ason and settle this matter amicably. Please respond 
immediately confirming that you will promptly refund $114,540.53 of=the $160,833.33 deposit which LSJE, LLC 
previously paid to you, or I will have =o choice but to turn this matter over to LSJE, LLC's.
