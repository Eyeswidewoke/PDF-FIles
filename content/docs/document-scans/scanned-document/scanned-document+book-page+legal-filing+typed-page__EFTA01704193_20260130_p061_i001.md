Enjoy Fine Dining Around the World 
For dinner reservations across town, across the country, or across 
the ocean, look to the Fine Dining program available to you as a 
Platinum Carde member. Every day, a reservation is held at more 
than 1,000 of the most highly acclaimed restaurants in the U.S., 
Canada and abroad. So when the need arises for a reservation at a 
hometown favorite or an outstanding restaurant in another city, Fine 
Dining can help. 
Reservations are provided on a first-come, first-served basis, so please call as early as 
possible. All cancellations must be made by calling Platinum Card Concierge at least 24 
hours in advance of the reservation, otherwise a $15-per-person cancellation fee ($60 
minimum, $120 maximum) will apply. 
To make a Fine Dining 
reservation, please call 
1.800345.2639, option 2.
