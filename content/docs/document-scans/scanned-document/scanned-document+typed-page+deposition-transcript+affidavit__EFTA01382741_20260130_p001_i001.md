S-1/A 
Table of Contrail 
stock withheld in payment of the exercise price or taxes relating to an award and shares equal to the number of shares surrendered in payment of 
any exercise price or taxes relating to an award are deemed to constitute shares not issued to the participant and are deemed to again be available 
for awards under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, unless the shares arc withheld or surrendered after the termination of the plan. or at the time 
the shares arc withheld or suntridered, it would constitute a material revision of the plan subject to stockholder approval under any then-applicable 
rules of the exchange on which the shares of Claw A common stock arc listed. Awards may. in the sole discretion of the Committee, be granted in 
assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by an entity directly or indirectly acquired by us or with which we 
combine (referred to as "substitute awards"), and such substitute awards will not be counted against the Absolute Share Limit, except that substitute 
awards intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" will count against the limit on incentive stock options described above. No award may be 
granted under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan after the tenth anniversary of the effective date (as defined therein), but awards granted before then 
may extend beyond that date. Following the effective date of the plan. no further awards will be granted under the 2007 Equity Plan. 
Options. The Committee may grant non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options. under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
with terms and conditions determined by the Committee that arc not inconsistent with our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan; provided, that all stock 
options granted under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan arc required to have a per share exercise price that is not less than 100% of the fair market 
value of our Class A common stock underlying such stock options on the date such stock options arc granted (other than in die case of options that 
are substitute awards), and all stock options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options must be granted pursuant to an award agreement 
expressly stating that the options arc intended to qualify as an incentive stock options, and will be subject to the terms and conditions that comply 
with the rules as may be prescribed by Section 422 of the Code. The maximum term for stock options granted under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive 
Plan will be ten years from the initial date of grant. or with respect to any stock options intended to qualify as incentive stock options, such shorter 
period as prescribed by Section 422 of the Code. However, if a non-qualified stock option would expire at a time when trading of shares of our 
Class A common stock is prohibited by our insider trading policy (or "blackout period" imposed by us), the term will automatically be extended to 
the 30th day following the end of such period. The purchase price for the Class A shares as to which a stock option is exercised may be paid to us, 
to the extent permitted by law (1) in cash or its equivalent at the time the stock option is exercised. (2) in Class A shares having a fair market value 
equal to the aggregate exercise price for the shares being purchased and satisfying any requirements that may be imposed by the Committee 
(provided that such shares have been held by the participant for at least six months or such other period established by the Committee to avoid 
adverse accounting treatment). or (3) unless otherwise provided by the committee, whether in an award agreement or otherwise: (A) in other 
property having a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the purchase price. (B) if there is a public market for the shares at such time. 
through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell the shares being acquired upon the exercise of the stock option and to deliver to 
us tlx: amount of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate exercise price for the shams being purchased, (C) through a "net exercise" 
procedure effected by withholding the minimum number of shares needed to pay the exercise price or (D) by such other method as the committee 
may permit, in its sole discretion. Any fractional shares of Class A common stock will be settled in cash. 
Stock Appreciation Rights. The Committee may grant stock appreciation rights, under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, with terms and 
conditions determixxxl by the Committee that arc not inconsistent with our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Committee also may award stock 
appreciation rights independent of any option. Generally, each stock appreciation right will entitle the participant upon exercise to an amount (in 
cash, shares or a combination of cash and shares, as determined by the Committee) equal to the product of (I) the excess of (A) the fair market 
value on the exercise date of one share of Class A common mock, over (B) the strike price per share, times (2) the number of shares of Class A 
common stock covered by the stock appreciation right. The strike price per share of a stock appreciation right will be determined by the Committee 
at the time of grant but in no event may such amount be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the date the 
stock appreciation right is granted (other than in the case of stock appreciation rights granted in substitution of previously granted awards).
