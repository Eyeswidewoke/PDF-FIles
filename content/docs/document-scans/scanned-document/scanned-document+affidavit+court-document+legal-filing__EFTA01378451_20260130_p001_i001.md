that would require directors of publicly traded firms to act as fiduciaries to multiple 
stakeholders, and conform their discourse to fiduciary standards in all corporate speech 
about or to such constituents. Shareholders are not entitled to the default terms of 
shareholder primacy in corporate charters. We should give the support of our public 
institutions, including our corporate law, securities laws, tax laws, and other public 
advantage, to such stakeholder equality corporations. 
Nevertheless, even if one were to take the view that the First Amendment would forbid 
the imposition of fiduciary discourse standards on corporate speech to multiple 
stakeholders, given the latitude that the Supreme Court has required for corporate 
commercial and political speech, 
it would seem much more difficult to argue that 
government cannot prescribe corporate default terms that call for multi-stakeholder 
governance and concomitant fiduciary-based internal corporate speech about 
shareholders, employers and consumers. These permissible changes to internal corporate 
discourse would likely be sufficient to spur significant changes over present patterns in the 
way that corporations speak to non-shareholders, without requiring formal, heavy-hand 
government enforcement of external corporate speech. 
CONCLUSION 
Corporate speech contributes to many public policy problems, perhaps most obviously 
in the area of public health. Through advertising and other commercial speech, firms 
manipulate consumer perceptions of the risks or other consequences associated with the 
consumption of their products. Through lobbying and other political speech corporations 
undermine the development of government regulations which might otherwise curb 
exploitative corporate conduct in the commercial arena. The shareholder primacy norm in 
corporate governance is the real culprit behind this dynamic. Corporate law tells directors 
to run their firms in the interests of shareholders alone, while other stakeholders are left to 
fend for themselves or else rely on ineffectual external governmental regulation. r 228] 
These corporate speech problems can be solved through the reform of corporate law. 
In particular, this Article has argued that the pernicious effects of corporate speech can be 
ameliorated by extending the fiduciary obligations of corporate directors to include non-
shareholding stakeholders that are otherwise targets of corporate misconduct, including 
employees and consumers. A multi-stakeholder corporate governance regime could be 
institutionalized by altering the discourse norms that underlie and give shape to corporate 
speech. Such a reform would change the way that corporate directors speak about various 
stakeholders in their internal deliberations and decision-making, and it would change the 
way that firms speak to their various stakeholders through advertising and other externally 
directed speech. This Article has also examined a sampling of discourse norms which 
scholars, policymakers, and businesspeople might look to when institutionalizing multi-
stakeholder corporate governance, including familiar norms that govern personal or 
fiduciary engagements, as well as fully artificial ones, such as "expressive 
overdetermination," 
or "integrity." 
Future work in this area may reveal other discourse 
norms that could improve the social utility of corporate speech by getting corporations to 
speak about and for the interests of all of their stakeholders, rather than for shareholders 
alone.
