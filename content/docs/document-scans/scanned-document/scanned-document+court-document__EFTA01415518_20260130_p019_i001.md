upon the failure of certain financial coverage tests to be satisfied). Any 
such redemption may cause the economic return from an investment in the 
Notes to vary from the expected economic return. A majority of the 
Subordinated Notes may direct that the Notes be redeemed as described 
herein, and in determining to direct such redemption, any holder of Notes is 
under no obligation to consider an investor or any other party's interests. 
If the product is redeemed before its scheduled maturity date, an investor 
may receive back less than their original investment, or even zero; and 
investors will not receive any interest payments which would have been due 
if the product had redeemed at its scheduled maturity. In addition, the 
failure to satisfy certain financial coverage tests could result in an 
elimination, deferral or reduction in the payments to be made to holders of 
one or more classes of Notes, which could adversely impact the economic 
return realized by such holders. 
Average Life of the Notes. The average life of each class of Notes is 
expected to be shorter than the number of years until their stated maturity. 
Such average lives will be affected by numerous factors described in the 
transaction documentation. 
Limited-Recourse Obligations. The Notes will be limited-recourse 
obligations, payable solely from the Portfolio. No recourse may be had to 
any person or entity other than to the Issuer in respect of such collateral 
in respect of payments or distributions on the Notes. 
Volatility due to Leverage. Any investment in Subordinated Notes will 
represent a leveraged investment. Utilization of leverage is a speculative 
investment technique and involves certain risks to investors, particularly 
to investors that bear the first risk of loss. The use of leverage generally 
magnifies opportunities for gain and risk of loss. 
Potential for Interruption and Deferral of Cash Flow. If certain minimum 
collateral par value ratios or interest coverage ratios are not met (e.g., 
due to collateral defaults), then cash flow that otherwise would have been 
available to pay to holders of Subordinated Notes would instead be used to 
redeem the Notes until the ratios again exceed the minimum required levels 
or such Notes are paid in full. This could result in an elimination, 
deferral or reduction in the cashflow to the Notes, which may adversely 
impact the pre-tax and after-tax returns. 
Ratings Not Necessarily Indicative of Asset Quality. The ratings assigned 
to the Notes or any Collateral Obligation by the rating agencies are not 
necessarily indicative of the quality of the Notes or such Collateral 
Obligation, as applicable. Credit ratings only represent the rating 
agencies' opinions of credit quality and are not a recommendation to buy, 
sell or hold assets. They do not purport to assess market, regulatory or 
other risks that are relevant to the assessment of the quality of an asset. 
Credit ratings may not accurately assess credit risk and may be reduced or 
withdrawn at any time. The rating agencies may modify their ratings 
criteria at any time and the ratings of the Notes or
