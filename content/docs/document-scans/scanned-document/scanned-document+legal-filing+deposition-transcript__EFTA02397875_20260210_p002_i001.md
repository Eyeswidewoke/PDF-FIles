were just the latest in a seri=s of annual ruminations here on the troubles of the globalization movement=the 
conference symbolizes. 
It's hard to be a convincing S=englerian amid so much good food and drink, not to mention money. But let=92s ponder 
one aspect of what might be called the "Davos Dystopia" — namely, the way in which the elite networking=it represents 
has unintentionally worked to undermine social cohesion in t=e larger world. Even as the elites have become better 
connected, resentmen= toward them has seemed to grow back home — fueling discontent. 
The gloomy Davos sessions were a=recognition that 2011 was the year of the protester — from Occupy Wall S=reet and 
the Tea Party to the Arab Spring <http://www.washingtonpost.com/arabupheaval> to riots in London and Greece. 
So how does it work, this cycle =f simultaneous globalization and disconnect? What you see here are some of=the 
smartest business and political leaders in the world gathering to discuss common problems. It's a heady feeling,=to see 
so much global talent in one place. And increasingly, this elite shrres connections with great global institutions —
universities such as Ha=vard and Stanford, companies like Google and Microsoft, global financial giants like Goldman 
Sachs. <=p> 
It's an inclusive elitism: The=magnet draws the rising tycoons from developing countries and fuses them w=th the once-
dominant Americans, British, Germans and French. That's the most likable feature of the forum, the wa= you see 
Chinese and Indians and Egyptians and Pakistanis shuffling down t=e streets in their snow boots, along with the Swiss 
hosts. They are part o= the connected world, just as much as the old-line bankers and CEOs from the West. 
But let's think for a moment a=out the flip side of this process. As the "best and brightest" from th= developing world 
plug into the global grid, they inevitably unplug from their local political, business and cultural n=tworks. It's a subtler 
version of what used to be called the "brain dr=in." The entrepreneurs keep their businesses at home, where they are 
mak=ng their money, but they and their children join the global elite in a web of Four Seasons hotels and Ivy League 
tuiti=n bills. 
And back home? The anger begins =o boil. Rage against the elites is a global phenomenon these days — as p=werful in 
America as it is in Egypt. People resent a system that offers increasing returns to power and privilege, and=they take to 
the streets in protest. In regions such as the Arab world, wh=re the elites have been especially disconnected from the 
masses, the rage =an explode into revolution. 
Why do you think Chinese leaders=are so nervous? They know that a billion people out in the hinterlands are=watching 
elite Chinese on television and envying the newly rich from Shanghai and Guangzhou who buy Louis Vuitton l=ggage for 
their trips abroad. That's why the Chinese talk so much about =93balanced growth" — to spread some of the new 
wealth and ease resentm=nts against the rich in the coastal cities. 
The people filling the power vac=um, as the corrupt local elites fall in Egypt and Tunisia, are the ones wh= would never 
have been invited to Davos before. They are from excluded organizations, such as the Muslim Brotherho=d. But their 
very separation from the global elite was one reason the insu=gents could ally so effectively with the public: They never 
disconnected f=om the local grid; they remained in the mosques and souks among the masses. 
But here's the most interestin= part — and the reason why the globalization process retains its dynamis=. It happens 
that some of the leading revolutionaries of 2011 were at Davos last week, too, as if to claim their seats. Among th= most 
interesting discussions here was one that included Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh
