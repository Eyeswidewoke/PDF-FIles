I previoudly sent you the note that I wr=te over a year ago. to lay out what i would and wouldn't d=.my resposniblites. 
and those that were not. things I thought were n=eded so that you wouldnt find yourself in the place where you 
curren=ly find yourself. 
With regard the more pressing issue=l am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong inclination is 
not to be=20 involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught w=th many pitfall many that will make 
you very upset and a major pain in the ass. =AO I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people involved need to 
=e upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the begi=ning of my involvement ) I am also aware 
however of my overar=hing friendship obligations of ok, -given all the complexities =who else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. child=en with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking with little 
direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyo=e would report to him. 
eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long=shot my first choice as I prefer only being 
responsible and standing behind =y own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be transmi=ted to reflect 
status stated by others ) 
With =o commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to think 
through the problem creatively=. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you might find very 
costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk scaring, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my to=ms 
doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator. not sure what role you prefer for=Eileen as 
you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Ric= your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom 
report to a =ew person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy gregory, I wo=ld suggest limiting to one person. The 
increasing public profile needs to be tak=n into consideration. 
talk later..c 
eileen did not r=port to delson, she continued to provide bad info to you ( cash flows Etc)=C2 and me no one was hired 
to run YOUR office until two months ago =AO eileen followed your instructions. not mine. in fact she continued to 
ignore=mine saying " but leon " . You would become frustrat=d when i pointed out each instance. my team was not 
hired to do the=20 contracting as opposed to architecture, you kept your own team. with eileen at the head. 
instructions were given , detailed but igno=ed by your people. ,ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? in your calculation 
from where you were to where you are . you made a h=ll of a deal. -- negotiating down the original amount requested 
, base= on our friendship and suggesting carlyn was partially my fault. ( though I had never been asked to follow u=, 
just provide you the name of the most highly recommended ). suggesting that Tom was now that last word on tax 
characterization frnakly =s a bit much. however that is in the past. In order to move f=rward 
I only have my time to sell. alllocate, enjoy,=C2 , I have answered every call brad , joslin, ada or you have ma=e since 
dec.. reviewed docs over and over/ inserted myself strongly=when i thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar 
and time c=ncessions last year. I am wiling to continue to do so , but not will=ng to work for free. I did not press though 
you found yourself in di=e circumstances and in fact due to the seriousness. of those very ci=cumstances took extra care 
not to.
