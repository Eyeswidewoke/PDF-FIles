AGP LP 519 Alpha Group Capital Paul Barrett 
(b) 
there exists any state of affairs as a result of which (i) disposal of investments of the 
Partnership would not be reasonably practicable or cannot be completed in a timely fashion to meet 
withdrawal requirements and might seriously prejudice the Limited Partners or (ii) it is not reasonably 
practicable for the Partnership to determine fairly the value of its net assets; 
(c) 
none of the requests for withdrawals which have been made may be lawfully satisfied by 
the Partnership in U.S. dollars; or 
(d) 
there is a breakdown in the means of communication normally employed in determining the 
prices of a substantial part of the investments of the Partnership. 
Distributions in Cash or in Kind 
All distributions to a Partner on withdrawal or retirement will be made in cash or. in the discretion of 
the General Partner, in securities (which may include short positions as well as long positions) selected by 
the General Partner, or partly in cash and partly in securities (which may include short positions as well as 
long positions) selected by the General Partner. In-kind distributions may be made directly to the 
withdrawing Partner or, alternatively: 
(a) 
may comprise interests in special purpose vehicles established by the Partnership for the 
purpose of liquidating the securities which are being transferred (either outright or by a participation 
interest) by the Partnership; or 
(b) 
may be distributed into a liquidating trust or liquidating account and sold by the Partnership 
for the benefit of the withdrawing Partner. 
In the event of (a) or (b) above, (i) payment to such Partner of that portion of its withdrawal 
attributable to such securities will be delayed until such time as such securities can be liquidated and (ii) the 
amount otherwise due such Partner will be increased or decreased to reflect the performance of such 
securities through the date on which the liquidation of such securities is effected, and any applicable 
expenses. Management Fee and Incentive Allocation. 
11. BROKERAGE AND CUSTODY 
The Investment Manager is authorized to determine the broker or dealer to be used for each 
securities transaction for the Partnership. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions, the 
Investment Manager need not solicit competitive bids and does not have an obligation to seek the lowest 
available commission cost. It is not the Investment Managers practice to negotiate -execution only' 
commission rates, thus the Partnership may be deemed to be paying for research, brokerage or other 
services provided by the broker which are included in the commission rate. 
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is a -safe harbor" that permits 
an investment manager to use commissions or "soft dollars" to obtain research and brokerage services that 
provide lawful and appropriate assistance in the investment decision-making process. The Investment 
Manager will limit the use of "soft dollars" to obtain research and brokerage services to services which 
constitute research and brokerage within the meaning of Section 28(e). Research services within Section 
28(e) may include, but are not limited to, research reports (including market research); certain financial 
newsletters and trade journals; software providing analysis of securities portfolios; corporate governance 
research and rating services; attendance at certain seminars and conferences; discussions with research 
analysts; meetings with corporate executives; consultants' advice on portfolio strategy; data services 
(including services providing market data, company financial data and economic data); advice from brokers 
on order execution; and certain proxy services. Brokerage services within Section 28(e) may include, but 
are not limited to, services related to the execution, clearing and settlement of securities transactions and 
functions incidental thereto (i.e., connectivity services between an investment manager and a broker-dealer 
and other relevant parties such as custodians); trading software operated by a broker-dealer to route
