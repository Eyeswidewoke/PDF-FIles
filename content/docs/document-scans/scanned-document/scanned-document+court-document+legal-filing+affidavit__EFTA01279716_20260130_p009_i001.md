the owners of the capital stock or other units of ownership on the date of this Agreement entitled to vote

(b) 
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may, (i) at its option, declare 
all of the Obligations, including the entire unpaid principal of all Notes, all of the unpaid interest accrued 
therein, and all of the other sums (if any) payable by Borrower under this Agreement, any Notes, or any of 
the other Loan Documents, to be immediately due and payable, plus three percent (3%) of the unpaid 
principal of all Notes declared due by Lender (as compensation for reinvestment costs and not as a 
penalty), and (ii) proceed to exercise any one or more of the following remedies and any additional rights 
and remedies permitted by law (none of which shall be exclusive), all of which are hereby authorized by 
Borrower: 
(i) 
Borrower shall upon demand assemble or cause to be assembled any or 
all of the Equipment at a location designated by Lender; andfor to return promptly, at 
Borrower's expense, any or all of the Equipment to Lender at such location; 
Lender may itself or by its agents enter upon the premises of Borrower or 
any other location where the Equipment is located and take possession of and render 
unusable by Borrower any or all of the Equipment, wherever it may be located, without 
any court order or other process of law and without liability for any damages occasioned 
by such taking of possession; 
Sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any or all of the Equipment, whether 
or not in Lender's possession, at public or private sale with or without notice to Borrower, 
with the right of Lender to purchase and apply the net proceeds of such disposition, after 
deducting all costs of such disposition (including but not limited to costs of transportation, 
possession, storage, refurbishing, advertising and brokers' fees), to the obligations of 
Borrower under the Notes and the other Loan Documents, with Borrower remaining liable 
for any deficiency, or retain any and all of the Equipment; 
(w) 
Proceed by appropriate court action, either at law or in equity (including 
an action for specific performance), to enforce performance by Borrower or to recover 
damages associated with such Event of Default; or exercise any other right or remedy 
available to Lender at law or in equity; and 
(v) 
By offset, recoupment or other manner of application, apply any security 
deposit, monies held in deposit or other sums then held by Lender or any affiliate of 
Lender, and with respect to which Borrower has an interest, against any obligations of 
Borrower arising under this Agreement, any Notes or any other Loan Document, whether 
or not Borrower has pledged, assigned or granted a security interest to Lender in any or 
all such sums as collateral for said obligations. 
(c) 
Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless for any loss, 
personal injury (including death), or damage to property, suffered by Lender, its employees or any of its 
agents in connection with its entry onto the premises of Borrower or any third party hereunder. Each of 
the rights and remedies of Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents is in addition to all of 
its other rights and remedies hereunder, under the other Loan Documents and under applicable law and 
nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be construed as limiting any such right or 
remedy. Lender's failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right, power or remedy available to Lender 
shalt not constitute a waiver or otherwise affect or impair its rights to the future exercise of any such right, 
power or remedy. Waiver by Lender of any Event of Default shall not be a waiver by Lender of any other 
or subsequent Events of Default.
