If any of our raw materials or supplies are alleged or proven to include 
contaminants affecting the safety or quality of our products 
(including, for example, bacteria, mold or as a result of animal or human-
related pandemics, such as outbreaks of bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy, foot-and-mouth disease, avian influenza, or any other 
disease), we may need to find alternate materials or supplies, delay 
production of our products, discard or otherwise dispose of our products, or 
engage in a product recall, all of which may have a materially adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We may be unable to detect or prevent the use of ingredients which do not 
meet our quality standards if our ingredient suppliers engage 
in fraud or attempt to cover up or obscure deviations from our guidelines 
and procedures. For example, we recently discovered that a facility owned 
by a major supplier of ingredients to the pet food industry, including Blue 
Buffalo, for a period of time, had mislabeled as "chicken meal" or 
"turkey meal" ingredients that contained other poultry-based ingredients 
that were inappropriate for inclusion in "chicken meal" or "turkey meal" 
under industry standards, and it appears that this mislabeling was 
deliberate. This supplier was one of our primary sources of chicken meal and 
turkey meal. Any such conduct by any of our suppliers may result in a loss 
of consumer confidence in our brand and products and a reduction in 
our sales if consumers perceive us as being untruthful in our marketing and 
advertising and may materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, 
business, financial condition and results of operations. 
If our sources of raw materials and supplies are terminated or affected by 
adverse prices, weather conditions or quality concerns, we may 
not be able to identify alternate sources of raw materials or other supplies 
that meet our quality controls and standards to sustain our sales volumes 
or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
We are involved in litigation with Nestle Purina PetCare Company and related 
class action lawsuits that include allegations of false advertising 
relating to the ingredients contained in our pet food. Regardless of whether 
we are successful in our defense of these claims or in our counter 
claims, this litigation may adversely affect our brand, reputation, 
business, financial condition and results of operations. 
On May 6, 2014, Nestle Purina PetCare Company, or Nestle Purina, filed a 
lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Missouri, alleging that we have engaged in false 
advertising, commercial disparagement and unjust enrichment. Nestle Purina 
asserts that, contrary to our advertising claims, certain BLUE products 
contain chicken or poultry by-product meals, artificial preservatives and/or 
corn and that certain products in the BLUE grain-free lines contain grains. 
Nestle Purina also alleges that we have made false claims that our 
products (including LifeSource Bits) provide superior nutrition and health 
benefits compared to our competitors' products. In addition, Nestle 
Purina contends that we have been unjustly enriched as consumers have paid a 
premium for BLUE products in reliance on these alleged false and 
misleading statements, at the expense of our competitors. Nestle Purina 
seeks an injunction prohibiting us from making these alleged false and
