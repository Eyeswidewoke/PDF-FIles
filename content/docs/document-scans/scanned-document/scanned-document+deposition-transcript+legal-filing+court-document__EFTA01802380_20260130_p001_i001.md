Daily Mail: His Buffoon Highness strikes again 
His Buffoon Highness strikes again: Prince Andrew parties with sex =ffender pal 7th December 2010 Daily Mail 
After the battering his public image has taken, you might have expected =rince Andrew to be keeping his head down. 
But astonishingly, instead of =ying low, he has been partying in New York at the home of a man who was =n prison last 
year for serious sex offences. 
Hedge-fund tycoon Jeffrey Epstein, 57 — whose crimes included =oliciting a minor for prostitution — invited the Prince 
to join a =igh-powered dinner party at his Manhattan townhouse. 
Living it up: Prince Andrew 
When he got there, Andrew was relieved that no one was brave enough to =sk him about his WikiLeaks gaffes. All they 
were interested in was the =oyal wedding of his nephew, Prince William, to Kate Middleton. 
Andrew was in jolly mood, I am told, especially when other guests, =ncluding Hollywood star Woody Allen, asked him for 
an invite to April's=wedding. 
Another guest, CBS anchor Katie Couric, told him she would be =roadcasting live from outside Westminster Abbey, and 
asked: 'If I =ail your BlackBerry, will you give me the details on what is happening =nside?' 
Andrew apparently loved being the centre of attention. As for Epstein, =e was preening among this powerful group that 
he'd got his longtime =oyal friend to come. 
But then, Andrew loves a party. And Epstein has always been good at =hrowing them. It has brought them close enough 
for the Prince to have =nvited the former Wall Street trader to stay not only at Sandringham, =ut also at Buckingham 
Palace, in the past. 
The two have also holidayed together in Thailand. But since his 13-month =rison sentence in Florida, Epstein is unlikely 
to be a guest in the =ueen's house again. 
Coming so soon after the disclosures by an American ambassador that the =rince was 'cocky' and 'rude', Andrew's 
decision to live it up =n New York — especially with Epstein — calls into question yet =gain the judgment of the man 
entrusted with the role of being a trade =nvoy for Britain. 
Now it is lamentably clear that the man referred to by some of the =iplomats he has come into contact with as HBH —
His Buffoon Highness =97 does not do his homework. 
For when he chose to insult the French by repeatedly labelling their =ountry corrupt, he was unaware that the U.S. 
ambassador to Kyrgyzstan =e was talking to, Tatiana Gfoeller, is French. 
Born in France, Ms Gfoeller is the daughter of celebrated former French =ecret intelligence agent turned Cold War spy 
novelist Vladimir Volkoff. 
Back in New York, Andrew was in his element. Jokingly comparing himself =o Prince Harry, he said: 'Like Harry, I'm just 
the younger =rother.' And when asked by Woody Allen how his ex-wife Fergie was, he =eplied: 'She's very well — we live 
together.'
