that for TMS studies, positioning the more focal figure-of-eight 
TMS coil according to the 10-20 EEG system Ls reliable when 
dealing with larger scale conical areas, Thus, for stimulating 
a relatively large and well-defined conical region u the aPFC 
stereotaxic neuronavigation systems are certainly not neces-
sary. In a PET study, Lang et al. (2005) have placed the tDCS 
electrodes over the primary motor cortex (identified by 
inducing motor evoked potentials with TMS) and over the 
right fronto-polar cortex (directly above the right eyebrow) 
and found the highest increase in regional cerebral blood flow 
below the stimulating electrodes in the primary motor cortex 
and the aPFC. Moreover, Okamoto et at (2004) established 
recently for transcranial stimulation studies a correspondence 
between the 10-20 EEG system and magnetic resonance 
imaging based stereotaxic space (Talairach coordinates and 
the standard template of the Montreal Neurological Institute) 
and expressed the anatomical structures for the 10-20 conical 
projection points probabilistically. Their findings show that 
despite interindividual variance in the structure of the pre-
frontal cortex, the electrode position over 172 is with a 100% 
probability in BA 10. Taking these findings into account. 
positioning the tf/CS electrode over FP2 stimulates mainly BA 
10. hlowever, due to the use of relatively large electrodes (4 x 6 
cm) to prevent heating artifacts, stimulation of the junction to 
BA9 has to be considered as well. 
Nitsche and Paulus (2000) have shown that a minimum 
current density of 0.017 mA/cm2 is necessary to modify 
cortical excitability by tDCS in humans. The applied current 
density of 0.04 mA/cm2 in this study is in accordance with 
several tDCS studies demonstrating functionally relevant 
modulating effects on cortical excitability (cf. Hummel ct al. 
2005; Nitsche et al. 2007). One might further suspect that the 
3D pattern of brain sulci and gyri might create an overall 
change in current polarity in the targeted brain areas. However, 
current density calculations from our laboratory (Rockstroh 
et al. 1989) and from other research groups (Rush and Driscoll 
1968; Miranda et al 2006) as well as direct intracellular 
measurements of DC stimulation (Purpura and McMurtry 1965) 
revealed an average current flow in the expected direction 
independent of single sold and gyri. 
The findings of the present study are also particularly 
interesting in the light of clinical evidence suggesting that 
psychopaths, who arc classified as pathological liars, have 
significantly less gray matter in their PFC (Yang et al. 2005) and. 
remarkably, do not show higher SCR when telling lies 
(Verschuerc ct al. 2005). We have previously demonstrated 
that in psychopaths limbic-prefrontal regions (amygdala, 
orbitofrontal cortex, insula, and the anterior cingulate), and 
SCR during anticipation of aversive events Ls pathologically 
reduced (Veit et al. 2002; Birbaumer et al. 2005). In a social 
reactive aggression paradigm. Lour: et al. (2007) have shown 
that during retaliation, subjects with high psychopathic scores 
had less BA 9/10 activation in comparison to subjects with low 
psychopathic scores. These findings are in accordance with the 
results of other research groups reporting decreased prefrontal 
blood flow (for a review, see Blair 2007) and deficient 
autonomic responses, for example, SCR, in anticipation of 
threatening events (Blair et at 1997; Hare et al. 1978). 
Moreover, several studies (Anderson et at 1999: Moll et al. 
2005) have also shown that in psychopaths and patients with 
aPFC lesions, moral cognition is impaired. Thus, our findings 
support the hypotheses that a dysfunction of the aPFC and its 
specific connections may underlie certain psychopathological 
conditions that are characterized by the absence of sympa-
thetic arousal while performing a wrongful act such as 
deceiving in a criminal interrogation. 
Finally, concerning the current debate on emerging ethical 
issues in neuroscience (cf. Farah 2002), interdisciplinary 
research and communication are needed to address the 
following question: If neuroscientific research can demonstrate 
that deceptive behavior and moral cognition are not only 
associated with the activation of specific brain areas, but may 
even be modulated by noninvasive stimulation of these areas, 
what implications will such findings have on our concept of 
personal responsibility and neurocthical applications?
