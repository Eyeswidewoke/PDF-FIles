identity of the whistle-blower have been watched by hundreds 
of thousands of people on YouTube. And images professing 
to be of the person have circulated on Instagram...under 
dozens of different hashtags." All told, the name has been 
shared by more than about half a million users of Facebook, 
according to an estimate from CrowdTangle. 
Morel! 
Urges 
"Full-Throated" 
Support 
For 
WhisUeblower. 
In a commentary in The Cipher Brief 
(11/14), former CIA director Michael Morell writes, 'The many 
directors with whom I worked at CIA regularly sent messages 
to the workforce. I did so when I served as Acting Director. ... 
I do not know whether or not the current Director of National 
Intelligence Joe McGuire has sent a message to the IC 
workforce on the whistleblower, but I sure hope so because 
the whistleblower deserves his full-throated support." Morell 
added, '1 wanted to write my own note to the IC workforce 
and, indeed, to the American people. On Monday, a former 
US Attorney equated the whistleblower to John Wilkes Booth, 
the assassin of President Lincoln. I was appalled and 
angered by such an outrageous and despicable comment. I 
believe that the former US Attorney, Joe diGenova, should 
apologize and that all members of Congress...should 
denounce the comment in the strongest possible terms." 
Assange's Attorney Tells Court He Has 
Unsuitable Computer In Jail. Reuters (11/18) reports 
from London, 'WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is 
struggling to prepare for his case fighting extradition to the 
United States because he has been given an unsuitable 
computer in prison, his lawyer told a British court on Monday." 
Assange, 48, 'who spent seven years holed up in Ecuador's 
embassy before he was dragged out in April, is wanted in the 
United States to face 18 counts including conspiring to hack 
government computers and violating an espionage law. He 
could spend decades in prison if convicted." According to 
Reuters, 'Appearing at London's Westminster Magistrates' 
Court via video link, Assange spoke only to confirm his name 
and date of birth in a hearing that lasted just a few minutes." 
His attorney, Gareth Peirce, 'told the court that her client was 
unable to adequately prepare for his 'very challenging case' 
as the computer he had been given was not suitable. 'After 
months of battle he was provided with a computer but it is not 
the sort of computer needed to work on the case,' Peirce 
said." Judge Vanessa Baraitser "said she had no jurisdiction 
over his conditions in prison." 
Swedish Prosecutor Drops Rape Investigation 
Against Assange. 
Reuters (11/19, Ahlander, Johnson) 
reports that a Swedish prosecutor yesterday 'dropped a rape 
investigation against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, 
ending the near decade-old case that had sent the anti-
secrecy campaigner into hiding in London's Ecuadorian 
embassy to avoid extradition." Assange "skipped bail in 
Britain to avoid possible extradition and took refuge in the 
embassy in 2012. He was dragged out by police in April this 
year, and is now in jail fighting extradition to the United States 
on computer hacking and espionage charges unveiled after 
he left the embassy." 
ICIG IN THE NEWS: 
Trump Criticizes Intelligence Inspector General 
For Seeking "Publicity For Himself." 
The 
Washington Examiner (11/15, Chaitin, 448K) reports 
President Trump accused IC Inspector General Michael 
Atkinson of seeking 'publicity for himself in his handling of a 
whistleblower 
complaint 
that 
spurred 
impeachment 
proceedings." The public rebuke of Atkinson "comes days 
after it was reported the president discussed firing the 
government watchdog due to concerns about loyalty." Trump 
said during an appearance Friday on the new Dan Bongino 
Show, "The IG brought it directly to Congress. Let's get some 
publicity for himself." Trump "argued that if Atkinson had seen 
the transcript of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian 
President Zelensky he would have had second thoughts 
about the complaint focused on that conversation." Trump 
said, "When he sees the call he would have been — he should 
have said, 'Well, there's no case here." 
Graham Says Horowitz Will Testify About FISA 
Abuse Probe On Dec. 11. Axios (11/18, Basu, 521K) 
reports Senate Judiciary Chairman Graham announced 
Monday that Justice Department Inspector General Michael 
Horowitz will testify before his committee Dec. 11 'about his 
investigation into alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act (FISA) during the Russia probe." The 
Washington Examiner (11/18, Chaitin, 448K) says the 
announcement, which came "after what appeared to be 
multiple delays," is 'a clear sign the report on FBI intelligence-
gathering activities related to the 2016 presidential election is 
slated to be released to the public in the coming weeks." 
Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said on Fox 
News' Special Report (11/18, 1.53M), "It is kind of hard to 
believe that this investigation by the inspector general would 
have gone on all this time if he did not find any wrongdoing 
on the part of those that were involved in the investigation into 
President trump and the way they handled the warrants and 
so on. So I think we can probably fairly anticipate that this 
information will say that. It has no direct effect perhaps, on 
the charges against the President in his current impeachment 
hearing, but it does damage his critics and it does call their 
motives and their behavior into question. And it affects the 
political atmosphere, and I think that the likely outcome of this 
is that it makes it easier still, easier than it already is, for 
Republicans both in the House and the Senate to continue to 
support the President.'
