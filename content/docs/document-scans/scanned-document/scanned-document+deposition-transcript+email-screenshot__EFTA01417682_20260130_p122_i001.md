Risk Factorsl (continued) 
An investment in Preferred Shares involves a high degree of risk, including 
possible loss of Preferred Shares holder's investment, and is suitable only 
for sophisticated investors who can bear such 
losses. The value of the Preferred Shares and their derived income may fall 
or rise. Any forecasts provided herein are based upon the Issuer's and the 
Portfolio Advisor's opinion of the market at this 
date and are subject to change dependent on the market. Past performance or 
any prediction, projection or forecast on the economy or markets is not 
indicative of future performance. The Portfolio 
Advisor's team develops target performance range information by reference to 
the historical performance of assets suitable for an investment by the 
Issuer, analyzed in the context of the investment 
environment(s) that the Portfolio Advisor expects may be relevant to the 
investment program of the Issuer. It is also assumed that the Portfolio 
Advisor will be in a position to continue to identify and 
analyze target investments in view of information available to it at the 
time of the investment decision pertaining to, amongst other things, asset 
quality, sponsor credit, term of loan, interest rate, 
security, debt service coverage ratio, loan-to-value ratio, cash flow 
analysis, loan structure and other related information that the Portfolio 
Advisor deems relevant. In developing target performance 
information, the Portfolio Advisor uses historical information related to 
the performance of investments that would meet the specified criteria for an 
investment by the Portfolio Advisor, adjusted to reflect 
any modified assumptions, such as capital markets conditions, capital flows 
and liquidity, relating to the investment environment that the Portfolio 
Advisor expects for the Issuer. 
Any forecasts or opinions provided are based upon the Portfolio Advisor's 
opinion of the market as at this date and are subject to change, dependent 
on future changes in the market. Any prediction, 
projection or forecast on the economy, stock market, bond market or the 
economic trends of the markets is not necessarily indicative of the future 
or likely performance. Information herein is subject to 
significant uncertainty. Market conditions are unprecedented, which 
exacerbates the uncertainty that is inherent in any discussion of future 
events. Although the Portfolio Advisor believes that the 
assumptions made in connection with the preparation of the analysis herein 
have been made in good faith and are reasonable, no representation or 
warranty is made as to whether any of the events 
set forth herein will occur. Any target returns provided herein are an 
objective only and are not a forecast, projection or prediction of the 
Preferred Shares, future performance or actual profit or cash 
available for distribution. Neither the Portfolio Advisor nor the Issuer can 
provide no assurance that any target returns will be achieved. Prospective 
investors in the Preferred Shares should not place 
any reliance on the target returns in deciding whether to invest in the 
Preferred Shares. 
As noted in some of the charts and tables provided herein, performance 
figures do not reflect the deduction of fees and expenses charged or 
incurred by the strategy; such figures would be lower had
