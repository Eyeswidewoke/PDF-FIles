By Roger Runningen and James G. Neuger 
March 20 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama expanded 
u.s. financial sanctions to 20 more Russian officials, 
businessmen and a bank and authorized potential future penalties 
that would directly target sectors of the Russian economy. 
"we're imposing sanctions on more senior officials of the 
Russian government," Obama said on the South Lawn of the white 
House. "In addition, we are today sanctioning a number of other 
individuals with substantial resources and influence who provide 
material support to the Russian leadership, as well as a bank 
that provides material support to these individuals." 
with Russia poised to annex Crimea and its troops massing 
near Ukraine's border to the east and south, the U.S. and the 
European Union are moving to coordinate ramped up economic 
pressure on Russian President vladimir Putin and his allies. 
Obama is set to travel next week to Europe to consult with EU 
leaders, who were meeting today to work on a unified position. 
Today's action is against 20 individuals, members of the 
Russian government and business leaders who the u.s. says have

also includes Bank Rossiya in St. Petersburg, which U.S. 
officials said has 410 billion in assets and is the 17th largest 
bank in Russia. 
sanctions Targets

the Russian Federation; Andrei Fursenko, an aide to Putin; 
Vladimir Yakunin, chief executive officer of 0444 Russian 
Railways; billionaire Gennady Timchenko, a co-founder of oil 
trader Gunvor Group Ltd; businessman Arkady Rotenberg, a former 
judo partner of Putin whose companies won more than S7 billion 
of contracts for the 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi, and his 
brother, Boris, and Vuri Kovalchuk, a partner at Bank Rossiya, 
according to a list released by the Treasury Department. 
Eight of the 20 were previously designated by the EU. 
The sanctions, based on an executive order issued March 17, 
ban the individuals' entry, freeze any personal assets they may 
have in the U.S. and bar them from doing business with any U.S. 
company or financial institution. 
A V.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity to discuss the details, said the individuals won't 
have access to any u.S. financial services and will have
