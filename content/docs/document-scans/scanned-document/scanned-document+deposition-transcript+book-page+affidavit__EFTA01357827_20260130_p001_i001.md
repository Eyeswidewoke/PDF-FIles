Samson Resources 
Relative Value 
Samson had a vulnerable credit profile even before the current weakness in the 
commodities market given its high leverage levels and the modest quality of its 
asset base. Nevertheless, we had a constructive view on the company for two 
reasons, the company had a good proved asset (or PV-10) coverage (relative to 
its yield levels) and we expected an equity infusion by the sponsors as part of 
the restructuring of its business. 
With the sharp downward shift in the 
commodity market, the first contention is not valid given the substantial 
erosion in PV-10 value. As regards the second, the sharp depletion in the value 
of its net assets largely rules out the possibility of an equity infusion. The 
$2.25 billion Senior Notes '20 currently trade in the 30s, which implies the 
equity value of the business is negative -$1.5 billion. Given this it does not 
make economic sense for the sponsors to invest equity into the business. 
Therefore, the credit is now basically driven by the outlook for fundamentals, 
which is clearly precarious. Leverage levels are already at 5.5x and this is set to 
worsen further over the next two years to 9.4x on earnings weakness. We see 
EBITDA deteriorating meaningfully from FY 14E levels of $622 million to $496 
million in FY 16E - based on flat production levels and weaker realization. The 
lower EBITDA levels are not sufficient to meet its maintenance levels capex 
(excluding capitalized interest) of $630-$700 million. Moreover, the company 
also has a high annual interest burden of -$290 million. Overall, we are seeing 
a FCF burn of close to $950 million over the next two years - i.e. a business 
which cannot even sustain maintenance level capex. Also worrying, current 
liquidity is just $434 million - the company will run out of cash by 1H 16 unless 
there is an expansion in the borrowing base (we are assuming a $500 million 
addition to its credit facilities in 2016, likely from a second lien loan). Further 
aggravating the weak outlook, Samson, which has generally been a 
conservative hedger and protector of cash flow, has fairly modest hedges for 
FY 15 (40%) and FY 16 (25%) driving further downside risk to our estimates; for 
example, at $60/$3, net leverage could be close to 12x levels by FYE 16 and 
cumulative FCF burn through FY 16 would be $1 billion. 
Even in our base 
case, we see the company breaching, by a wide margin, the net leverage 
covenant limit of 4.5x in CO 16 (the covenant has been relaxed through FYE 15). 
Overall, many of the positive ideas we discussed in our 2014 initiation of the 
credit are being turned on their head given the commodity backdrop especially 
the deteriorating PV-10 and equity infusion in addition to the difficulty of 
selling assets in this market. Our initial call was very catalyst driven - positive 
ones. Further, given that a structure has already been set up to layer in 
additional second lien debt ($500 million), we see future layering as highly 
probable outcome. So, while SAIVST 9.75% Notes '20 bonds are trading in the 
36/38 context, we do see further downside. We therefore move to a SELL 
from a BUY rating on those notes. Upside risks include an equity infusion from 
the sponsor, assets divestitures and/or distressed debt exchanges.
