Thanks for breakfast yesterday. I w=ite this in order to memorialize our conversation. 1. Yo= agree that a committee 
should be set up to manage your financial. affairs= . your statement that you realize you are no longer capable of doin= 
so . You suggested that Terje larson be in charge as you fully trus= his judgement. A lawyer , either joel klein , his wife? 
and o= ALan haperrin, should over see the legal aspect. You said that you =oped that if possible rene abd abilgail could 
each be left with approx 100=million dollars in trust each. the balance sholud be structured so t=at you may give it away 
and enjoy the process. you said that 50 mlii=n should go the israeli equivablent of a rhodes scholarship program that 
i=amar would help structure. 50 million to columbia to pay salar=es of the brain researchers. all houses planes shoudl 
be sold =nd only the new york apt kept as rene was comfortable there. . =You suggested the Daily news and us news 
should be sold. , the print=ng press should be closed. and sold. ( if possible without a bankriutpcy.=C2 ►. you will most 
lilely leave bxp in december . and thought th=t Rand R would be more valuable in the future. . We agreed gthat giv=ng 
such large suns away should and would be your main focus, Seperat= and aprt form the recent will change. that was 
done by ellen harrison , t=rms of which you were fuzzy on, you wanted alan duglash to get into =he nitty gritty of the 
tax returns. you thought that in the in=erim media was well magened by holliber, . and real esate by 
=C2 You 
wanted jamie to be involved in the distribution of funds b=t suggested he was not capable of fully understanding the 
issues and the c=mplexity. You told me that you recognized that your capability to de=I with this was only decreasing, 
and wanted a team to be fully respo=sbilte and that you acknowledgged that you were not able to truly fo=low its 
progression so that you prefered to delegate with as much protecti=n as possible the people involved. so that they could 
operate with a free =ut watched hand. I told you that I prefer not to be involved but =AO if you again chose to bite the 
bullet, I would sell all the investments=C2 . all. restructure all the trusts. all. and direct the m=nentization of the bxp 
position. Im not sure if you will again chang= your mind, but must protect myself and the people you have asked me to 
ge= involved. Your foundation will have to be staffed as well. =AO Again I reiterated that 40 million up front paid by 
tranfereing bxp sto=k or assigning part of your investemnt portfoliol would be ok, as lo=g as we could secure it. I 
recognzied that cash flow was your concer= and said we would find a way, but would only do so with other peopl=s 
involvement so as to confirm your desires. 
I am a friend , I would like to do as you ask, but as you have change= your mind more than once , I remain available. . 
Recogz=ig yesterday , that you were no longer able to deal with these issues, =AO and wanted help, and as i suggested 
we might need to get a judge =r other legal sign off, to validate any arrangement as you might tend to f=rget in the 
future , I wish you will.
