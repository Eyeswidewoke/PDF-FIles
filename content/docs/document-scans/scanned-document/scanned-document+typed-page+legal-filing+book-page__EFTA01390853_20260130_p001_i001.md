Section 7 Risk Factors 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV, LP 
GP or the Manager is required to take such action, the relevant Investor must indemnity the Fund against any loss 
suffered 
Risks related to electronic communications 
The Manager, the General Partner and the Fund's service providers may provide to each Investor statements. reports 
and other communications relating to the Fund and/or each such Investor's Interest in electronic form, such as email or 
via a password protected website (*Electronic Communications"). Electronic Communications may be modified, 
corrupted or contain viruses or malicious code, and may not be compatible with an Investor's electronic systems. In 
addition, reliance on Electronic Communications involves the risk of inaccessibility, power outages or slowdowns for a 
variety of reasons. These periods of inaccessibility may delay or prevent receipt of reports or other information by one or 
more of the Investors. 
Cybersecurity 
The Manager, the U.S. Adviser, the General Partner and the Fund's service providers and other market participants 
increasingly depend on complex information technology and communications systems to conduct business functions.
These systems are subject to a number of different threats or risks that could adversely affect the Fund and/or the 
Investors, despite the efforts of the Manager, the U.S. Adviser, the General Partner and the service providers to adopt 
technologies, processes and practices intended to mitigate these risks and protect the security of their computer 
systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of 
information belonging to the Fund and the Investors. For example, unauthorized third parties may attempt to improperly 
access, modify, disrupt the operations of, or prevent access to, these systems of the Manager, the U.S. Adviser, the 
General Partner, the Fund's service providers, counterparties or data within these systems. Third parties may also 
attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers. third-party service providers or other users of the Manager's 
systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Manager's data or that of the Investors. A 
successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Manager's systems could result in the loss or theft of an 
Investor's data or funds, the inability to access electronic systems, loss or theft of proprietary information or corporate 
data, physical damage to a computer or network system or costs associated with system repairs. Such incidents could 
cause the Manager, the U.S. Adviser, the General Partner, the Fund or their respective service providers to incur 
regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs or financial loss. 
Pay-to-play laws, regulations and policies 
A number of U.S., state and municipal pension plans have adopted socalled -pay-to-play' laws, regulations or policies 
that prohibit, restrict or require disclosure of payments to (and/or certain contacts with) state officials by individuals and 
entities seeking to do business with state entities, including investments by public retirement plans. The SEC has also 
adopted rules that, among other things. prohibit an investment adviser from providing advisory services for compensation 
with respect to a government plan investor for two years after such investment adviser or certain of its executives or 
employees make a contribution to certain elected officials or candidates. If the Manager, the U.S. Adviser, Credit Suisse 
Asset Management Limited (in its capacity as the placement agent) or their respective affiliates fail to comply with such 
pay-to-play laws, regulations or policies, such non-compliance could have an adverse effect on the Fund.
