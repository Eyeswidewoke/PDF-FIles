Authorisation of the Manager 
The following sections of this Section 10: Certain Legal, ERISA and Tax Considerations of this Memorandum make 
reference to the Manager being authorised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority to the extent required by the EU 
Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and its implementing legislation in the UK (the 'AIFM Authorisation') 
and its steps to comply with obligations arising therefrom. Although the Manager has applied for the AIFM Authonsation, 
as of the date of this Memorandum, the Manager has not yet received the AIFM Authorisation. 
Valuation 
The Fund's valuations will be prepared in accordance with The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulations 2013 
on a fair value principle, based on US GAAP and Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820 Fair Value 
Measurement. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritises sources and valuation techniques. Accordingly 
the Fund will be valued at an 'exit price' which is the value that would be received on selling the investment in an orderly 
transaction, between market participants at the measurement date. The Manager will establish a Valuation Committee to 
perform an assessment of valuations provided by the relevant investment specialists, together with acquisition 
information that has been gathered to understand each individual Investment. The Valuation Committee comprises of 
individuals not directly associated with the Fund, such as the responsible finance manager, the DB PE Chief Financial 
Officer and the DB PE Chief Operating Officer. Given the inherent challenges of establishing valuations for illiquid 
investments, periodic reviews and detailed assessments of the underlying investments will be undertaken to ensure the 
Valuation Committee has a sufficient understanding to reasonably assess and ensure the information they are provided 
with is fair and accurate. The Valuation Committee members, its terms of reference and the Manager's valuation policy 
will be periodically assessed and internally audited to ensure compliance with the principles of the AIFMD.

among the Investment Platforms on an equitable basis in its good faith discretion and in accordance with its internal 
investment allocation guidelines. These are based on the applicable investment guidelines of such Investment Platforms. 
portfolio diversification requirements and other appropriate factors. 
In addition, as described more fully in Section 7: Summary of Terms and Conditions, the Manager has a clear and 
defined approach to side letter arrangements. Further, amendments to the Fund Partnership Agreement which would 
materially and adversely affect a Limited Partner in a way which discriminates against such Limited Partner vis-à-vis the 
other Limited Partners or increase the Commitment of a Limited Partner will require the consent of the affected Limited 
Partner. 
Liquidity management 
The investment strategy of the Fund is aligned to the liquidity profile of the Fund and the redemption parameters. Except 
in extraordinary and very limited circumstances, Limited Partners will not have the ability to withdraw from the Fund or 
redeem their Interests. As such, the Manager does not propose to adopt a liquidity management system and procedures 
as described in the AIFMD given that the liquidity is naturally aligned to that of the Investors due to the Fund being
