Leon, 
I hate having to write this. however . I wanted you to understand the seriousness of your dysfunctional family office. 
and have a record of my telling you so. I spent the greater =art of last week reviewing your office. . The office has 
suffe=ed greatly from lack of control clear direction. and the disasterous delay=in removing Eileen. Eileen has been a 
nightmare for you . she has hammered together the office in a willy nilly fashion either trying to hire c quality people, 
buying c=eap equipment, looking to save small dollars, hiding all bad facts. even =fter hiring people . giving them no 
clearly defined roles , or nonse=sical direction. . she and ada protecting what they see as their turf, errors upon errors 
upon error=. ( only this thurs forming a new Ilc for alex with no imput from finance.=C2. ) millions of dollars 
unaccounted for. 500k again found in a drawer=20 last week In early sept I notified you that I thought that joslin 
was=unable to deal with both ada and eileen . I sent delson in to referee.. at my expens= . i again notifed you in early 
oct that she needed to go asap as close to oct 15 as possible . and ada till march. I pointed out the risk of keepin= the 
dynamic duo was their effect on joslin and future mistakes.. . in nov I sent you a email telling=you i thought he could 
not take more of their interefernce. obfuscation and scheming. and sugg=sted getting rid of both immediatly, again in 
writing.. this=week, in the first face to face I had withloslin since dec he could not respond to simple questions , 
spoke finnacial gibberish, had misleading answers. bad answers wild elliptical statements , and =on sensical plans . 
therefore . As you asked i immediatley confronted Brad with my findings , and to my amazement=C24 and frankly 
dismay Brad said that his take was exactly the same as mine but this is how he found Joslin in early jan and thought it 
was just his normal behavior. Since brad has little financial expertise he asuumed the gibberish was just his ,brads, lack 
of understanding , In mid nov you suggested that he was your choice to run the office .and he would replace eileen. 
from mid dec he audited until early jan, when he assumed the job th=t im told now is only 75% of his time. HE might. , 
might? be c=pable of running your office but i have yet to see any indication that that is true. He is certai=ly a loyal 
friend. ON thurs I handed the same spread sheet that I had sent to brad, to four*=A0 financial execs. (only to mine 
with actual numbers), to a person each=20 within minutes said this makes no sense. no sense whatsoe=er, bad 
numbers bad cagtegories. bad inputs outputs numbers that dont add. if=20 it was an mri , of joslin i woudl say serious 
breakdown. 4P=A0I had him overin an attempt to explain to my team what had happened, and then s=nt my do to 
speak for hours to him and others at elysium. I pointed out to you that joslin could not make the first pass at hiring a 
finance person . I was right. HE is a great tax person, period. no social skills reporting skills or mgmt skills. ITS a mess 
and a larger one than I thought. sorry, I have begun to interview some cfo.s.=A0 for you and have put out more 
feelers. if you feel comfortable i think you should ask at apollo for=20 help.. It is now too late to remove eileen entirely 
as i had beentA0 urgently requesting. I have not spoken to her in months . but during this craz= delay in doing so, 
she is now significantly more entrenched. the office more intricantly entwined and a danger to you. A re-do is necessary 
. top down. 
you have repeatedly pointed out and I know you believe ,that you have pa=d me what you consider a great deal of 
money. you are one of my best friends. in my=mind to say you had made a good deal would be an gross understatment. 
I have spe=t the majority of the last year restructuring your things. as you are aware=C2* I canceled my europe trips 
for the last six months of last year. money, friends and clients have suffered as a result of the tim= it took to clean up 5 
years of silliness.. however I take our frie=dhsip very serioulsy and feel not one iota of regret . I made a bad deal ,lived 
up to=20 it. and exceeded the predictions made on your behlaf. 
=C24> that being said, you will need to bring in a few people to start from the top down. apollo review, coordination, 
ta0bill pay, book keeping, legal reporting,filings, sec gaming foreign, pfic=20 fbar gift gtax use tax, corporate admin,
