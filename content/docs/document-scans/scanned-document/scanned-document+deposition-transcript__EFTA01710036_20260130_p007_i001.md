EXPLANATION OF YOUR 
ASVAB STANDARD SCORES 
Your ASVAB results aremported asstandardscores 
in the above graph. Your score on each test Is 
identified by the '1r in the corresponding bar 
graph.You should view thesescores as intimate-sof 
your true skill level in that area. If you took the test 
again, you probably would receive a somewhat 
different score. Many thino., such as how you were 
feeling during testing,tontribute to this difference. 
This difference is shown with gray score bands in 
the graph of your results. Your standard scores are 
based on the ASVAB tests and composites based on 
your grade level. 
The score bands provide a way to identify some of 
your strengths. Overlapping score bands mean 
your true skill level is similar in both areas, so the 
real difference between specific scores might not be 
meaningful. If the score bands do not overlap, you 
probably are stronger in the area that has the higher 
score band. 
YOUR ASVAB PERCENTILE SCORES 
Your ASVAB results are reported as percentile 
scores in the three columns to the right of the graph. 
Percentile scores show how you compare to other 
students - males and females, and for all students - 
in your grade. For example, a percentile score of CS 
for an 11th grade female would mean she scored 
the same or better than OS outof every100 females 
in the 11th grade. 
For purposes of career planning, knowing your 
relative standing in these comparison groups is 
important. Being male or female does not limit 
your career or educational choices. There are 
noticeable differences in how men and women 
score in some areas. Viewing your scores in light 
of your relative standing both to men and women 
may encourage you to explore areas that you 
might otherwise overlook. 
You can use the Career Exploration Scores to 
evaluate your knowledge and skills in three gert 
eral areas (Verbal, Math, and Science and Techni-
cal Skills). You can use the ASVAB Test Scores to 
gather information on specific skill areas. To-
gether, these scores provide a snapshot of pray 
cunent knowledge and skills. This information 
will help you develop and review your career 
goals and plans. 
The ASVAB is an aptitude test. It is neither an 
absolute measure of your skills and abilities nor a 
perfect predictor of your success or failure. A 
high score does not guarantee success, and a low 
score does not guarantee failure, in a future edu-
cational program or occupation. For example, if 
you have never worked with shop equipment or 
cars, you may not be familiar with the terms and 
concepts assessed by the Auto and Shop Henna-
don test. Taking a course or obtaining a part-
time job in this area would increase your knowl-
edge and improve your score if you were to 
take it again. 
USING ASVAB RESULTS IN 
CAREER EXPLORATION 
Your career and educational plans may change 
over time as you gain more experience and 
learn more about your interests. &Florin:Ca-
reers: The ASVAB Career Exploration Guide 
can help you learn more about yourself and the 
world of work, to identifyand explore potential 
goals, and develop an effective strategy to real-
ize yourgoals.The Guidewill help you identify 
occupations in line with your interests and 
skills. As you explore potentially satisfying 
careera,you will develop your career explora-
tion and planning skills. 
Meanwhile, your ASVAB results can help you 
in making well-informed choices about future 
high school courses. 
We encourage you to discuss your ASVAB 
results with a teacher, counselor, parent, family 
member or other interested adult. These indi-
viduals can help you to view your ASVAB 
results in light of other important inforntation, 
such as your interests, school grades,.motiva-
tion, and personal goals. 
MILITARY CAREERS 
AND 
ENTRANCE SCORES 
Two more scores can be especially use-
ful to you. The Military Careers Score is 
a composite of the ASVAB verbal, math, 
mechanical, and electronics tests. The 
Military Careers Score provides a link 
to occupations described in Military 
Careers:You will be able to see how well 
your skills, abilities, and career interests 
match those of Service personnel cur-
rently working in military occupations. 
Military Careers provides you with a 
clear image of whit workers do in these 
occupations, as well as other useful in-
formation about the occupations. 
The Military Entrance Score (also called 
, wWit stands fr the Arm 
Forces
AFQT Qualification Test is the score 
used to determine your qualifications 
for entry into any branch of the United 
States Armed Forces or the CoastGuard.

a general way how wellyou might do in 
training and on the job in military occu-
pations. Your score reflects your stand-
ing compared to American men and 
women Ili to 23 years of age.
