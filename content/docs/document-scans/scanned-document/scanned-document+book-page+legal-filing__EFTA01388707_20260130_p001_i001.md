remedies by Lender. 
6. 
Upon the occurrence of any of the 
following (each an "Event of Default") with respect 
to Debtor or any endorser, guarantor or other 
person liable for any of the Obligations: (i) failure 
to pay any Obligation when due, (ii) death (in the 
case of an individual) or dissolution, liquidation or 
suspension of its business, (iii) default in the 
payment of any indebtedness in excess of $50,000, 
(iv) failure to furnish financial information to 
Lender following demand, (v) any representation 
made to Lender shall be false or misleading in any 
material respect when made or deemed made, (vi) a 
material adverse change in its business or condition 
(financial or otherwise) as determined by Lender in 
its discretion, (vii) default in the performance or 
observance of any covenant, agreement or 
obligation under this Agreement (including, 
without limitation, Paragraph 4 hereof), or any 
other contract, instrument or agreement relating to 
the Obligations, (viii) insolvency (howsoever 
determined), or (ix) the commencement of any 
proceedings by or against any of them under any 
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement of debt, 
insolvency, receivership, liquidation, dissolution or 
similar laws relating to the relief of debtors, or the 
making of an assignment for the benefit of 
creditors; 
then and in any such event: (a) Lender may declare 
all of the Obligations to be immediately due and 
payable, 
whereupon 
same 
shall 
become 
immediately due and payable, without demand, 
provided, that if an event set forth in clause (ix) 
occurs, the Obligations shall automatically become 
due and payable without declaration by Lender, (b) 
Lender's obligation, if any, to give or continue 
credit facilities to Debtor shall automatically 
terminate; (c) Lender shall have the right from time 
to time to take possession of, and sell, redeem, 
assign, liquidate, transfer and deliver all or any part 
of the Collateral, at any brokers' board or exchange, 
or at public or private sale or otherwise, at the 
option of Lender, for cash or on credit for future 
delivery, in such parcel or parcels and at such times 
46178v12 
and places, and upon such terms and conditions as 
Lender may deem proper, and in connection 
therewith may grant options and impose reasonable 
conditions, all without (except as same are required 
by applicable law and cannot be waived) 
advertisement or demand upon or notice to Debtor 
or any other person entitled to notice or right of 
stay, 
extension, 
moratorium, 
appraisal 
or 
redemption of Debtor, all of which are hereby 
expressly waived to the fullest extent permitted by 
applicable law; (d) upon each such sale, Lender, to 
the extent permitted by law, may purchase all or 
any of the Collateral, free and clear of all claims, 
rights of redemption and equities of Debtor; and (e) 
in addition, Lender shall have all of the rights and 
remedies of a secured party under the UCC and any 
other applicable law. 
7. To the extent required by applicable law 
which cannot be waived, Lender will give Debtor 
notice of the time and place of any public sale or of 
the time after which any private sale or other 
disposition of Collateral is to be made, by sending 
notice at least 5 days before the time of sale or 
disposition, which Debtor agrees is reasonable. 
Lender need not give such notice if not required by 
the UCC or other applicable law. Debtor agrees 
that at any private sale Collateral may be sold at a 
price that is less than the price which might have 
been obtained at a public sale or that is less than the 
aggregate outstanding amount of the Obligations. 
Lender may accept the first offer received and need 
not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree. 
Lender may comply with any applicable state or 
federal law requirements in connection with a 
disposition of the Collateral and such compliance 
will not be considered adversely to affect the 
commercial reasonableness of any sale of the 
Collateral. Lender may convert any proceeds in 
foreign currency to U.S. dollars at the average of 
the buying spot rates of exchange for freely 
transferable U.S. dollars in effect at the lending 
office selected by Lender as at the close of business 
on the date of payment of the sales price for such 
Collateral. After deducting its costs and expenses 
from the proceeds of sale, Lender may apply any
