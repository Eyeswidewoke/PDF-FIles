Selected Purchase Considerations 
• APPRECIATION POTENTIAL — The Notes provide the opportunity to participate 
in the appreciation of the Reference Asset at maturity up to the 
Maximum Return on the Notes of 17%, or a maximum Payment at Maturity of 
$1,170 for every $1,000 Principal Amount of Notes. If a Knock-Out Event 
has not occurred, in addition to the Principal Amount, you will receive at 
maturity at least the Contingent Minimum Return of 4% on the Notes, or a 
minimum Payment at Maturity of $1,040.00 for every $1,000 Principal Amount 
of the Notes. Because the Notes are our senior unsecured debt obligations, 
payment of any amount at maturity is subject to our ability to pay our 
obligations as they become due. 
• THE CONTINGENT MINIMUM RETURN APPLIES ONLY IF A KNOCK-OUT EVENT HAS NOT 
OCCURRED - If a Knock-Out Event has not 
occurred, you will receive at least the Principal Amount at maturity, even 
if the Final Level is below the Initial Level. If a Knock-Out Event has 
occurred 
and the Final Level is less than the Initial Level, you will lose 1% of your 
Principal Amount for every 1% that the Final Level is less than the Initial 
Level. If a Knock-Out Event has occurred and the Reference Return is -100%, 
you will lose your entire investment. 
• DIVERSIFICATION OF THE EURO STOXX 500 INDEX — The return on the Notes is 
linked to the EURO STOXX 500 Index. The EURO STOXX 500 
Index is composed of 50 stocks from the Eurozone (Austria, Belgium, Finland, 
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, 
Portugal and Spain) portion of the STOXX Europe 600 Supersector indices. For 
additional information about the Reference Asset, see the information set 
forth under "The EURO STOXX 500 Index" in the Equity Index Underlying 
Supplement. 
• TAX TREATMENT — There is no direct legal authority as to the proper tax 
treatment of the Notes, and therefore significant aspects of the tax 
treatment 
of the Notes are uncertain as to both the timing and character of any 
inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. Under one approach, the Notes 
should 
be treated as pre-paid executory contracts with respect to the Reference 
Asset. We intend to treat the Notes consistent with this approach. Pursuant 
to 
the terms of the Notes, you agree to treat the Notes under this approach for 
all U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the limitations described 
therein, and based on certain factual representations received from us, in 
the opinion of our special U.S. tax counsel, Morrison & Foerster LLP, it is 
reasonable to treat the Notes as pre-paid executory contracts with respect 
to the Reference Asset. Pursuant to this approach, we do not intend to report 
any income or gain with respect to the Notes prior to their maturity or an 
earlier sale or exchange and we generally intend to treat any gain or loss 
upon 
maturity or an earlier sale or exchange as long-term capital gain or loss, 
provided that you have held the Note for more than one year at such time for 
U S. 
federal income tax purposes. 
We will not attempt to ascertain whether any of the entities whose stock is
