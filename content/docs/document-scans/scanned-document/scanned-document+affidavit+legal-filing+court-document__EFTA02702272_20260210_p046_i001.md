DESCRIPTION OF THE DEBT SECURITIES 
The following description of our debt securities sets forth the material terms and provisions of the debt 
securities to which any prospectus supplement may relate. Our senior debt securities are to be issued under an 
indenture between us and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, the form of which is incorporated by 
reference as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. We refer to this 
indenture in this prospectus as the "senior indenture." Our subordinated debt securities are to be issued under two 
separate indentures. Our subordinated debt securities which are issued to the trust in connection with the issuance 
of preferred securities and common securities by that trust are to be issued under an indenture which we 
sometimes refer to in this prospectus as the "trust-issued subordinated indenture." Our other subordinated debt 
securities are to be issued under an indenture which we sometimes refer to in this prospectus as the "subordinated 
indenture." Each of the trust-issued subordinated indenture and the subordinated indenture are between us and a 
trustee and the form of each is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a 
part. The trust-issued subordinated indenture and the subordinated indenture are sometimes referred to herein 
collectively as the "subordinated indentures." The senior indenture, the trust-issued subordinated indenture and 
the subordinated indenture are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "W. R. Berkley indentures" and 
each individually as a "W. R. Berkley indenture." The particular terms of the debt securities offered by any 
prospectus supplement, and the extent to which the general provisions described below may apply to the offered 
debt securities, will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
The following are summaries of the material terms and provisions of the W. R. Berkley indentures and the 
related debt securities. You should refer to the forms of the W. R. Berkley indentures and the debt securities for 
complete information regarding the terms and provisions of the W. R. Berkley indentures, including the 
definitions of some of the terms used below, and the debt securities. Wherever particular articles, sections or 
defined terms of a W. R. Berkley indenture are referred to, those articles. sections or defined terms are 
incorporated herein by reference, and the statement in connection with which such reference is made is qualified 
in its entirety by such reference. Wherever particular articles, sections or defined terms of a W. R. Berkley 
indenture, without specific reference to a particular W. R. Berkley indenture, are referred to, those articles. 
sections or defined terms are contained in all W. R. Berkley indentures. The senior indenture and the 
subordinated indenture are substantially identical, except for certain covenants of ours and provisions relating to 
subordination. The subordinated indenture and the trust-issued subordinated indenture are substantially identical, 
except for certain rights and covenants of ours and provisions relating to the issuance of securities to a trust. 
General 
The W. R. Berkley indentures do not limit the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities which we 
may issue thereunder and provide that we may issue the debt securities thereunder from time to time in one or 
more series. (Section 3.1) The W. R. Berkley indentures do not limit the amount of other Indebtedness or the debt 
securities, other than certain secured Indebtedness as described below, which we or our Subsidiaries may issue. 
Unless otherwise provided in a prospectus supplement, the senior debt securities will be unsecured 
obligations of ours and will rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The 
subordinated debt securities will be unsecured obligations of ours, subordinated in right of payment to the prior 
payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of ours as described below under "— Subordination of the 
Subordinated Debt Securities" and in the applicable prospectus supplement. The W. R. Berkley indentures do not 
limit the amount of senior. pari passu and junior Indebtedness that we may issue. 
As of September 30, 2014. we had outstanding approximately $2,488 million face value of senior notes and 
other debt, including $350 million face value of subordinated debentures. See Notes 16 and 17 to our 
consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2013, which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus.
