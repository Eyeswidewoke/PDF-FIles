S-I/A 
Table of Contrail 
publicly traded common Mock. In addition, while we are currently in compliance with portions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-
Oxley Act"), we will be required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and the NYSE, to implement specified 
corporate governance practices that currently do not apply to us as a private company. 
We arc currently a voluntary• filer and not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Upon completion of this offering, 
we will become obligated to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports. We will also be required to ensure that we have 
the ability to prepare financial statements on a timely basis that fully comply with all SEC reporting requirements and maintain effective internal 
controls over financial reporting. 
The additional demands associated with being a public company may disrupt regular operations of our business by diverting the 
attention of some of our senior management team away from revenue producing activities to management and administrative oversight, adversely 
affecting our ability to attract and complete business opportunities and increasing the difficult• in both retaining professionals and managing and 
growing our businesses. In addition, failure to comply with any laws or regulations applicable to us as a public company may result in legal 
proceedings and/or regulatory• investigations, and may cause reputational damage. Any of these effects could harm our business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
Future sales, or the perception offuture sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market following this offering could cause the 
market price for our Class A common stock to decline. 
After this offering, the sale of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, 
could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also 
might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 
Upon consummation of this offering, we will have outstanding a total of 160,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 719,030,067 
shares of Class B common stock that are convertible by the holders thereof into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock automatically 
upon transfer, subject to certain exceptions. Of the outstanding shares, the 160,000,000 shares sold in this offering (or 184,000,000 shares if the 
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares) will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), except that any shares held by our affiliates, as that term is defined under Rule 144 of 
the Securities Act ("Rule 144"), including our directors, executive officers and other affiliates (including KKR) may be sold only in compliance 
with the limitations described in "Shares Eligible for Future Sal6" 
The remaining 719,030,067 shares of Class B common stock, representing 82% of our total outstanding shares of common stock 
following this offering, will be "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 and subject to certain restrictions on resale following the 
consummation of this offering. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold 
pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144, as described in "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." 
In connection with this offering, we, our directors and executive officers, and holders of substantially all of our common stock prior to 
this offering have each agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of our or their common stock or 
securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock during the period from the date of this prospectus continuing through the 
date 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of both Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & 
Co. LLC. See "Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest)" for a description of these lock-up agreements.
