receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client 
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for 
different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of 
profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related 
to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be 
considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments to macroeconomic 
shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, 
to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates — these 
are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index 
fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the 
underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of 
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, 
where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-
dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed 
coupons. It is also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that 
differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. 
Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the 
risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements. 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, 
market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The appropriateness or 
otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent 
on the investors' own circumstances including their tax position, their 
regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, 
and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial 
advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the 
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and 
options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the high 
degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. 
Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all 
investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the 
"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at http://-
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you 
are unable to access the website please contact your Deutsche Bank 
representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from 
several factors, including the following: ( i) exchange rates can be 
volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of 
currencies may be affected by numerous market factors, including world and 
national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) 
currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed exchange 
controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in 
securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the 
currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed 
through the Deutsche Bank entity in the investor's home jurisdiction.
