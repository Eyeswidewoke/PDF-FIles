Erie County Dist. Attys. (Kevin Dillon, Erie 
County Dist. Any., of counsel). Buffalo, NY.

DECISION AND ORDER 
ARCARA, District Judge. 
Presently before the Court is a motion to quash a 
subpoena duces recum, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 
17, filed by Kevin M. Dillon, District Attorney for 
Erie County, New York. 
The District Attorney's 
motion seeks an order from this Court quashing a 
federal grand jury subpoena for state grand jury 
records. The panics were given an opportunity to 
brief and argue their respective positions. 
After 
reviewing the submissions of the parties and hearing 
argument from counsel, the Court denies the 
District Attorney's motion to quash the subpoena. 
BACKGROUND 
A federal grand jury investigation is currently 
being conducted regarding an incident which 
occurred on March S, 1990 in the Main Place Mall, 
Buffalo. New York, involving the arrest of Mark 
Aiken and Steven Johnson by officers of the Buffalo 
Police Department. 
Specifically, a federal grand 
jury is investigating allegations that certain officers 
of the Buffalo Police Department violated federal 
criminal civil rights laws during and after the arrest 
of Mr. Aiken and Mr. Johnson. (F141) 
FNI. The background and focus of the federal 
grand jury investigation is set forth in greater detail 
in an in camera submission of facts surrounding 
the federal grand jury investigation submitted by 
the United States. 
The District Attorney's Office prosecuted Mr. 
Arleen and Mr. Johnson on numerous state 
misdemeanor charges arising from this incident 
During the state trial, only two of the six or more 
officers who were either involved in or witnessed 
the 
incident 
in 
question 
actually 
testified. 
Consequently, the state trial shed little light on the 
officers' versions of the allegations that are the 
focus 
of 
the 
federal 
criminal 
civil 
rights 
investigation.

Following the conclusion of the state trial, the 
District Attorney's Office...presented the case to an 
Erie County grand jury that considered whether the 
officers' actions-Cu—ring and after the arrest of Mr. 
Aiken and Mr. Johnson constituted violations of 
state law. 
The United States, which was then 
conducting *332 its own investigation, delayed 
taking any action in the matter in order to prevent 
interference with the state investigation.

As a 
result, the-state investigation into the police officers' 
conduct concluded in approximately November, 
1990. 
When the District Attorney's Office concluded its 
investigation, the United States conducted an 
independent review of the matter and concluded that

After further investigation, evidence was presented 
to a federal grand jury in October, 1991. 
The United States claims that the federal grand jury 
investigation has reached a logjam because of the 
refusal of the police officers to cooperate with the 
Federal 
Bureau 
of 
Investigation 
("FBI"). 
Moreover, none of the officers who are most 
seriously implicated in the investigation submitted 
any written reports regarding the alleged incident, 
nor did most of the officers who were present and 
should have witnessed the incident. 
Thus, the 
United States argues that reviewing the transcripts 
and tapes of the state grand jury testimony of the 
police officers is the only way that it will be able to 
learn the officers' versions of what happened. 
The United States initially attempted to obtain the 
state grand jury material through informal means. 
When these efforts

October.2.), 1991 for the production of the grand 
jury transcripts or tapes of all witnesses who 
testified in this matter before the Erie County grand 
jury. 
At the request of the District Attorney's 
Office, the return date was delayed until January 8, 
1992, in an effort to facilitate the resolution of this 
matter. 
When further efforts to resolve the matter failed, 
the District Attorney filed the present motion to 
quash, raising four objections to the production of 
the state grand jury material.

Attorney argues
