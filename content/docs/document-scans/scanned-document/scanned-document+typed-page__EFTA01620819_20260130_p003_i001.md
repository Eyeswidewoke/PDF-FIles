sampled associated exclusively with Glomeromycota, with the 
exception of the derived gen US Anogramma where dual partnerships 
were detected. Our discovery finally provides an explanation for the 
unusual colonization patterns reported before in some lycopods 
(Duckett & Ligrone, 1992; Schmid & Obenvinkler, 1993), 
consisting of an intracellular phase and extensive fungal prolifer-
ation in gametophytic mucilage-filled intercellular spaces, as also 
reported in other Mucoromycotina-associated groups: the Haplo-
miotriopsida liverwort genus Treubia (Duckett a al., 2006), several 
hornwort genera (Desire eta!, 2013), and the Devonian fossil 
plant Horneoplryton hstneri (Strullu-Derrien etnl., 2014). We 
hypothesize that the associations between Mucoromycotina fungi 
and vascular plants are mutualistic. Beyond microscopy, our main 
line of evidence is the recent demonstration of mutualism between 
Haplomitriopsida liverworts and Mucoromycotina fungi (Field 
a al., 2014) closely related to those now detected in vascular plants. 
Our observations demonstrate that intercellular fungal prolif-
eration is a signature of Mucoromycotina colonization, and lend 
further support to the hypothesis that the early Devonian vascular 
plant Nothia, which also harboured inter- and intracellular fungi

largely confined to a zone where the tubers 
join the main root system and the lipid-filled

(Berbee & Taylor, 2007; Krings ttat, 2007a,b), formed associa-
tions with Mucoromycotina fungi (Pressel etal., 2010; Strullu-
Derrien et al, 2014). Nonetheless, where the fungi are exclusively 
intracellular (e.g. Anogramma), it is impossible to ascertain from 
cytology alone to which fungal group they belong, as both 
Glomeromycota and Mucoromycotina produce vesicles and 
hyphal coils. The short-lived fungal swellings or lumps typical of 
Mucoromycotina colonization in the Haplomitriopsida (Carafa 
et al, 2003; Duckett et al, 2006) are unique to this group, the only 
land plant lineage to date known to associate exclusively with 
Mucoromycotina fungi (Field cal, 2014). Arbuscules, the 
signature of Glomeromycota colonization in angiosperms, are 
produced in some lycopod and fern—Glomeromycota associations 
(e.g. Ptisana, Angioptens, °mune& — Ogura-Tsujita et A, 2013) 
but are lacking in others (see Strullu-Derrien cal, 2014 and 
references therein), as is also often the case in liverworts and 
hornworts. 
The presence of Glomeromycota and Mucoromycotina fungi in 
lycopods and the predominance of Glomeromycota in the later 
diverging ferns fit the phylogenetic distribution of these fungi in
