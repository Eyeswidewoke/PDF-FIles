8.1 degrees Fahrenheit) is no different, and no more certain, than it was 30 years ago. And this is despite an heroic 
research effort costing billions of dollars. 
These and many other open questions are in fact described in the IPCC research reports, although a detailed and 
knowledgeable reading is sometimes required to discern them. They are not "minor" issues to be "cleaned up" by 
further research. Rather, they are deficiencies that erode confidence in the computer projections. Work to resolve these 
shortcomings in climate models should be among the top priorities for climate research. 
Yet a public official reading only the IPCC's "Summary for Policy Makers" would gain little sense of the extent or 
implications of these deficiencies. These are fundamental challenges to our understanding of human impacts on the 
climate, and they should not be dismissed with the mantra that "climate science is settled." 
While the past two decades have seen progress in climate science, the field is not yet mature enough to usefully answer 
the difficult and important questions being asked of it. This decidedly unsettled state highlights what should be obvious: 
Understanding climate, at the level of detail relevant to human influences, is a very, very difficult problem. 
We can and should take steps to make climate projections more useful over time. An international commitment to a 
sustained global climate observation system would generate an ever-lengthening record of more precise observations. 
And increasingly powerful computers can allow a better understanding of the uncertainties in our models, finer model 
grids and more sophisticated descriptions of the processes that occur within them. The science is urgent, since we could 
be caught flat-footed if our understanding does not improve more rapidly than the climate itself changes. 
A transparent rigor would also be a welcome development, especially given the momentous political and policy 
decisions at stake. That could be supported by regular, independent, "red team" reviews to stress-test and challenge the 
projections by focusing on their deficiencies and uncertainties; that would certainly be the best practice of the scientific 
method. But because the natural climate changes over decades, it will take many years to get the data needed to 
confidently isolate and quantify the effects of human influences. 
Policy makers and the public may wish for the comfort of certainty in their climate science. But I fear that rigidly 
promulgating the idea that climate science is "settled" (or is a "hoax") demeans and chills the scientific enterprise, 
retarding its progress in these important matters. Uncertainty is a prime mover and motivator of science and must be 
faced head-on. It should not be confined to hushed sidebar conversations at academic conferences. 
Society's choices in the years ahead will necessarily be based on uncertain knowledge of future climates. That 
uncertainty need not be an excuse for inaction. There is well-justified prudence in accelerating the development of low-
emissions technologies and in cost-effective energy-efficiency measures. 
But climate strategies beyond such "no regrets" efforts carry costs, risks and questions of effectiveness, so nonscientific 
factors inevitably enter the decision. These include our tolerance for risk and the priorities that we assign to economic 
development, poverty reduction, environmental quality, and intergenerational and geographical equity. 
Individuals and countries can legitimately disagree about these matters, so the discussion should not be about 
"believing" or "denying" the science. Despite the statements of numerous scientific societies, the scientific community 
cannot claim any special expertise in addressing issues related to humanity's deepest goals and values. The political and 
diplomatic spheres are best suited to debating and resolving such questions, and misrepresenting the current state of 
climate science does nothing to advance that effort. 
Any serious discussion of the changing climate must begin by acknowledging not only the scientific certainties but also 
the uncertainties, especially in projecting the future. Recognizing those limits, rather than ignoring them, will lead to a 
more sober and ultimately more productive discussion of climate change and climate policies. To do otherwise is a great 
disservice to climate science itself.
