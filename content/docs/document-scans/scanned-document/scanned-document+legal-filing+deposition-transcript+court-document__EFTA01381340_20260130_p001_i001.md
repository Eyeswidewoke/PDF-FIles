guarantee! by its parent BPP. The term loan facility expires on August 8.2019 and the revolving credit facility expires on August 8. 2017. 
As of December 31, 2012, the term loan is presented net of the related unamortized original issue discount ("O113"), which was $7.0 million at 
issuance. Accretion of OID is included in interest expense and was approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In

issuance costs are being amortized over the weighted-average term of the Facility (approximately 7 years) using the effective interest method. The 
proceeds from the term loan were used to fund a special dividend of $350 million to shareholders. 
On December 6, 2012, the Company and its lenders amended the Facility to, among other things, provide additional tern loan borrowings of $50 
million and allow for the distribution of dividends of $50 million. The proceeds from the additional term loan borrowings were used to fund a
