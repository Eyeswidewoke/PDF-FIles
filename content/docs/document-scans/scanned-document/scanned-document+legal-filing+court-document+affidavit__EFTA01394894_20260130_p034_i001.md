of an Interest hereunder, the Fund and the Manager may rely on the Fund records as to the identity of the 
Members and the permitted Transferees and other recipients of Interests, and all Members, Transferees 
and other recipients of Interests agree that the Fund and the Manager, in determining such rights, shall 
rely on such records and that Members, Transferees and other recipients of Interests shall be bound by 
such determinations. 
17.7 
Legends. If certificates are issued evidencing a Member's Interest, each such certificate

Third Party Rights. Any Manager Parties specified in Section 7.6.1 that is not a party 
to this Agreement may enforce any rights granted to it pursuant to this Agreement in its own right as if it 
was a party to this Agreement. Except as expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, a 
Person who is not a party to this Agreement shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third 
Parties) Law, 2014 (as amended) of the Cayman Islands to enforce any term of this Agreement. 
Notwithstanding any term of this Agreement, the consent of or notice to any person who is not a party to

assignment, novation, release or settlement under this Agreement at any time.

agents may require from time to time in connection with the Fund's obligations under, and compliance 
with, applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to AEOI. By executing this Agreement,

acknowledges that the Fund and the Manager may take such action as each of them considers necessary in 
relation to such Member's holding and/or distribution proceeds to ensure that any withholding tax 
payable by the Fund, and any related costs, interest, penalties and other losses and liabilities suffered by 
the Fund or the Manager, any other investor, or any agent, delegate, employee, director, officer, member, 
manager or affiliate of any of the foregoing persons, arising from such Member's failure to provide any 
requested documentation or other information to the Fund or the Manager, is economically borne by such

or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the 
other provisions of this Agreement, it being hereby agreed that such provisions are severable and that this 
Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted.
