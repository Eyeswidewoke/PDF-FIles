Holder a convertible debenture of like tenor to this Debenture, but in an amount equal to the 
remaining unpaid Principal Amount (after making appropriate adjustments for the Principal 
Amount that has been prepaid and any amount that has been converted into shares of Common 
Stock). 
Section 2. 
CONVERSION. 
2.1. 
Right of Conversion. This Debenture shall be convertible, in whole or in part, 
without the payment of additional consideration, at the option of the Holder, at any time and from 
time to time after the date hereof, into (i) the number of shares of the Payor's common stock 
("Common Stock"), par value $0.0001 per share, determined by dividing (a) the sum of (i) the 
then unpaid Principal Amount (or the portion thereof the Holder has designated for conversion) 
plus (ii) the amount of interest that has accrued but remains unpaid under this Debenture as of the 
date of such conversion by (b) the Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined). As used herein, 
"Conversion Price" means one dollar ($1.00), subject, however to adjustment as provided in 
Section 2.5. Any shares of Common Stock that are issued upon the conversion of the Debenture 
as contemplated hereby are hereinafter sometimes referred to as "Conversion Shares." 
2.2. 
Mechanics of Conversion. As a condition to the right of the Holder to be entitled 
to convert all or any part of this Debenture into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, 
the Holder (i) shall surrender this Debenture duly endorsed to the Payor or in blank at the office 
of the Payor or of any transfer agent for the shares of Common Stock, (ii) shall give written 
notice (in the form or substantially in the form of the Conversion Notice attached hereto) to the 
Payor at its principal corporate office of the election to convert the same and shall state therein 
the name or names in which the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of any 
part of this Debenture are to be issued and (iii) shall provide to the Payor such written and signed 
representations and warranties as the Payor may reasonably request so as to assure to the Payor 
that the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon such conversion will (when so issued) be 
exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 
"Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and other applicable 
securities laws (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Securities Regulations"). (such 
representations and warranties, collectively, the "Holder's Representations"). The Payor shall, 
as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to the Holder or to its nominee or 
nominees, at such location as the Holder may have designated in writing to the Payor (or in the 
absence of such designation, at such office) one or more certificates for the aggregate number of 
shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled as provided for herein. Such 
conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the 
date of the later to occur of such surrender of this Debenture and the Payor's receipt of the 
Holder's Representations, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common 
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or 
holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. Upon the issuance of shares of 
Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2 such shares of Common Stock shall be deemed 
to be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 
2.3. 
Partial Conversion. Upon conversion of this Debenture in part only, the Payor 
shall execute and deliver to the Holder, at the expense of the Payor, a new Debenture or
