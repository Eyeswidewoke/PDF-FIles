of its products are vegan. The challenge will be 
staying loyal to its sustainable roots as it rapidly 
grows. Executive Chairman Roberto de Oliveira 
Marques says the "value propositions that are the 
very essence of Natura" are appealing to consumers, 
particularly millennials, who look for "authenticity" 
in products and the companies that make them. 
Purpose-driven brands resonate more with young 
consumers, according to researcher Euromonitor 
International. About 60% of millennials responding 
to a lifestyle survey said they felt they could make 
a difference in the world through their choices and 
actions, compared with about 45% of baby boomers. 
Founded in 1969 as a store in Sao Paulo, Natura 
soon moved to direct sales, adding 2,000 consul-
tants over the next decade. Novelties, such as offer-
ing product refills in the 1980s and a line of soaps 
and creams that could be used by both new moms 
and babies in the 1990s, fed steady sales growth in 
a country obsessed with good looks. But though 
Brazilians are leaders in plastic surgery and popu-
larized the infamous Brazilian wax, the national con-
cept of beauty is more natural—think of model Gisele 
Bfindchen, with her signature loose hair. 
"Natura's broader portfolio, more focused 
on wellness as opposed to only beauty, puts it in 
a unique position to expand abroad;' says David 
Marcotte, a retail analyst with Rantar Consulting. 
"In other markets, you see the movement of beauty 
going into wellness. In Brazil it started the other way 
around. That's the grounding for their success!' 
Natura gets 30% of its revenue outside Brazil. 
The company began widening its scope in the past 
decade, buying a controlling stake in Australian lux-
ury skin-care brand Aesop in 2013 and British soap 
maker the Body Shop in 2017. It's taken steps to bring 
its sustainable ethos to those brands. Natura brought 
the Body Shop's marketing back to the cruelty-free 
cause that jump-started the brand in the 19705. It's 
also taken the fair-trade model it uses to procure its 
ingredients from the Amazon and expanded it to the 
African communities that provide moringa oil to the 
Body Shop. At Aesop, packaging changes will reduce 
plastic consumption by 124 tons per year. 
It's unclear how much Natura will transform 
Avon, whose sales plunged by half over the past 
to years, to $5.25 billion, in fiscal 2018 amid com-
petition from trendier brands. The company had 
given up on the U.S., selling the last of its stake in 
the American operations earlier this year, to focus 
on international markets. But it's still struggled to 
adapt to changing consumer tastes. 
The Avon acquisition will give the Brazilian com-
pany access to 27 new markets—including in China 
and Eastern Europe—as well as greatly expand 
the direct-sales model, which Natura says it can 
modernize and diversify. Marques plans to turn the 
combined companies' army of 6 million direct sell-
ers into social media sellers and influencers—who 
increasingly drive millennials' cosmetics purchases. 
Natura is also giving door-to-door associates pay-
ment machines and helping them open web stores. 
"This powerful sales network that gets into consum-
ers' homes already existed of line, and now it's con-
verting itself into an online network," Marques says. 
That's in line with industry trends. Elton 
Morimitsu, a Euromonitor analyst, says several 
brands are "abandoning the use of influencers with 
millions of followers;' he says. "They're betting 
• Number of direct-
sales associates Nature 
will have after Its 
purchase of Avon 
instead on microinfluencers with several thousands 
of followers, because the conversion rate into sales 
that the brand will have will be much higher!' 
Natura doesn't sell only through its consultants; 
it's made several brands available in drugstores, 
cut deals to sell others at big retailers, and opened 
52 proprietary stores, mostly in Brazil, to showcase 
its goods. It also has its own virtual store and is using 
the network of Body Shop franchisees in Southeast 
Asia to open Natura locations there. It has opened 
two stores in the New York area, but has no plans 
to expand quickly in the U.S., Marques says. Until 
that changes, American consumers need to rely on 
online shopping and influencers such as Ana Kcira, 
whose @fashionstylefoodie on Instagram has about 
45,000 followers. She posted a photo of herself 
spraying Natura's pataua oil, a hair strengthener, 
on a friend's braid in Central Park—which generated 
almost 700 likes. —Fabiola Mourn, with riffanyKary
