but your outreach coordina=or later rescinded the invitation, although I was reimbursed for that. = As you are aware, I 
subsequently discussed this with Neil in Vancouver in t=at year, and inquired about exactly what it was all about, and 
informed him=that either a formal procedure to resolve any issue in which I could partic=pate and respond might be 
appropriate, or the matter should be dropped. Nei= said he would explore the matter, and neither he, nor anyone else, 
ever co=tacted me following that. I have never been informed of anything lik= Buzzfeed has claimed. Indeed I have 
been invited back to Perimeter for sci=ntific meetings by various colleagues in the intervening years. = 
I am very concerned by this claim below, for obvi=us reasons. First, the 
original Perimeter source provided false and d=famatory information to Buzzfeed, changing a story only after I provided 
co=nter-evidence. Second, as you are aware Perimeter has never contacted=me about any such proviso in the interim. 
The only document I ever re=eived was in 2009 from michael assuring me the matter was closed, whatever i= was. I 
would find it highly irregular if any formal procedure took p=ace with such an outcome without my knowledge or 
without any due process, a=d without subsequently informing me. 
I expe=t the correct statement, if there is one, is that there was a 
complaint fro= someone at Perimeter about inappropriate communication at the final party o= while being driven back 
to the hotel after it (for all I know it may have b=en about religious issues), and that 3 years later a decision was made by 
t=e outreach coordinator, perhaps in collaboration with others, not to invite=me back at that time for a public lecture. 
=lease confirm my understanding of this issue for me if you will. As y=u 
can imagine, making this public is embarrassing enough for me, especially=since I personally maintain whatever I may 
have said wasn't inappro=riate, and there was certainly no sexual harassment by any definition of th=t word.. indeed 
there was nothing sexual in any discussion I know of. =Nevertheless, if something is to be reported, indicating that it was 
a comm=nication issue, and there was no formal ban on my returning to Perimeter (e=pecially as nothing along these 
lines was ever communicated to me and I hav= received invites since that time) is less damning than suggesting 
otherwis=. As Buzzfeed has tried, at every turn, to misrepresent facts in the w=rst possible light, it is important for me 
to not allow them to continue to=do this. For example, they contacted my university and asked if there=any claims fo 
sexual harassment against me at the University, and though th= University said there were not, but that there was an 
external allegation a=out a remote event that had been discredited (the one I mentioned above), B=zzfeed announced 
they would report that they contacted the University with a=request for information about sexual harassment 
allegations and were not gi=en any information in return.. 
Last, it coul= be of course that Buzzfeed has reiinterpeted statements 
from Perimeter sta=f, but if a member of your staff made the original false allegation to Buzz=eed (violating 
confidentiality in the process I expect) I would like you to=at least be aware of this and act accordingly. 
Thanks very much for your prompt and immediate attention to this
