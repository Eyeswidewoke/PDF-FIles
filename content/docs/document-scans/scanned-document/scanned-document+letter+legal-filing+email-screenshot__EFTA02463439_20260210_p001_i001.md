Antidisciplinary Science Fellows Proposal 
Replace Antidiscipinary with whatever =ord... 
Proposal: Antidisciplinary Science Fellows =rogram MIT Media =ab April =016 
The MIT Media Lab seeks support for a fellowship =rogram in Antidisciplinary Science. The Lab is a leader in this area, 
=hich promises to fundamentally rethink research and practice around =cientific inquiry. We seek $12 million to fund 
and operate the first =hree years of this fellowship program. 
Today, we face a crisis in science. Academic =cience is not leading to breakthrough innovations, and the disciplinary 
=tructures of the academy are largely to blame. Certain types of =esearch are recognized and rewarded, and become 
defined as disciplines. =s this happens, people begin talking only to a very small peer group, =ften by publishing in a 
small number of very specific journals. =eanwhile, we believe the most important scientific questions today =elide in the 
spaces between disciplines. 
In contrast to interdisciplinary work where people =rom different disciplines work together, the Media Lab is driven by 
=/span>antidisciplinary work. =nbsp;An antidisciplinary project isn't a sum of many =isciplines but something entirely 
new—the word defies easy =efinition. But what it means to the Media Lab is someone or something =hat doesn't fit 
within a traditional academic discipline—a =ield of study with its own particular words, frameworks, and methods. =ost 
academics are judged by how many times they have published in =restigious, peer-reviewed journals. This system often 
leads researchers =o align their work to the dictates of peer review rather than risking =he potential repercussions of an 
unconventional approach. Indeed, the =urrent peer review system causes hyper-specialization where people in =ifferent 
fields have a very difficult time collaborating—or =ven communicating—with people in other fields. 
When Joi thinks about the "space" =he Lab has created, he likes to imagine a huge piece of paper that =epresents "all 
science." The disciplines, such as =E2 chemistry," "genetics" or "design=E2 are small black dots on this paper. The 
massive amounts of =hite space between the dots represent antidisciplinary space. Many =eople would like to play in 
this white space, but there is very little =unding available, and it's even harder to get a tenured =osition without some 
sort of disciplinary anchor in one of the black =ots. 
Additionally, it appears increasingly difficult to =ackle many of the interesting problems—as well as the "wi=ked 
problems"—through a traditional disciplinary =pproach. Unraveling the complexities of the human body is the perfect 
=xample. Our best chance for rapid breakthroughs should come through a =ollaborative "One Science." But instead, we 
seem unable =o move beyond "many sciences"—a complex mosaic =f so many different disciplines that often we don't 
recognize =hen we are looking at the same problem because our language is so =ifferent and our microscopes are set so 
differently. 
So how do we find talent in as yet un-named =ields? We hypothesize that the regular academic processes of hiring and 
=eer review will not find these people. And current programs to find =xceptional individuals are either too organized or 
not organized =nough. There is a limit to how much the search for geniuses can and =hould be centrally planned and 
organized, as the best people tend to =ave their discussions outside of institutions. Events like ='Reilly's FOO Camp are a 
wonderful example of =uccessful models of unstructured ways of discovering and engaging such =alent. However, we 
are interested in exploring a different way that =etter integrates with the academic research structure. Therefore the
