elements of this new surveillance regime, including CCTV cameras, cell phone ISPs, credit card 
charges, radio police logs. and the hotel's electronic key swipe records. After DSK was arrested 
on charges of sexual assault, the Manhattan District Attorney's office subpoenaed that material. 
In August, however, the District Attorney came to the conclusion that the only witness in the case, 
the maid, could not be believed beyond a reasonable doubt, and moved on August 22, 2011 to 
drop the case, After the charges were dismissed, I obtained a significant part of this evidence 
from sources that prefer to remain anonymous for an article I was writing for the New York 
Review of Book. After the article, "What Really Happened to Strauss-Kahn," was published in 
November 2011, a great deal more of the court-protected documents became available to me. 
This time-stamped material, much of which is included in this book, allowed me to reconstruct 
the reality behind the mystery in a way that I could not have been done otherwise. 
FRIDAY MAY 13 
Chapter I 
From The W to the Sofitel 
At 5 pm on Friday May 13* 2011, Dominque Strauss-Khan, better known in France by his 
initials "DSK," boarded US Airways Flight 2180 at Reagan National Airport. 
The 62-year old 
French-born economist had a busy schedule. He planned to be in New York only overnight to 
see his daughter. He would to fly back to Paris on Sunday to see his American-born wife, Anne 
Sinclair, and then go that night to Berlin, where he had scheduled a meeting with Angela Merkel, 
the German Prime Minister. Since September 2007, he had been head of one of the world's most 
powerful financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund, an organization of sovereign 
states with the job of providing loans to any nation in financial trouble. For the past 6 months, he 
had to deal with a crisis of unprecedented proportions. Greece, one of the weakest economies in 
the European Union, was running out of money. It now had to refinance its massive debt but 
lacked the credit tor borrow money at rates it could afford. If it did not get the money in the next 
few months, it would have to default on its bonds. Such a bankruptcy would threaten the largest 
banks in France and Germany setting off a cascade of falling dominoes that could not only destroy 
the Euro but plunge Europe and America into financial chaos. Since the IMF was the largest 
holder of Greek debt, and could draw upon the resources of the 187 nation-states that constituted 
its membership, DSK expected to play a major role in preventing this impending disaster. DSK 
had qualification in this regard. After obtaining a law degree and PhD in economics at the 
Universitie Paris at Nanterre in 1977, he was appointed to head the finance department of the Plan 
Commission in 1982, Minister of Industry and Foreign Trade from 1991 to 1993, and Minister of 
Economy, Finance and Industry from 1997-1999. He had also played a major role in the French 
Socialist Party (PSI), having first been elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1986, and was now 
in line to be its Presidential candidate. Even though French President Nicolas Sarkozy had backed 
his appointment at the IMF four years earlier, he was now emerging as his leading rival for the 
presidency, and now he was well ahead of Sarkozy in all the national polls. If elected, he would 
be France's first Jewish president. 
DSK had come to Washington DC from Paris just three days earlier for a meeting of the IMF 
board. But IMF business, as crucial as it was, had occupied only part of his time that week. The 
night before he also had went to a libertine event at a suite in the W Hotel. The other guests,
