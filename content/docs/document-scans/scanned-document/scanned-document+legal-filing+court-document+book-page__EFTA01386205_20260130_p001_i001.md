15. OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT 
Term of the Partnership 
The Partnership will continue until December 31, 2035 and thereafter from year to year unless 
dissolved as provided in Section 9.02 of the Partnership Agreement. 
Liability of Partners and Indemnification of General Partner and Others 
The General Partner is liable to creditors for the debts of the Partnership. However, none of the 
General Partner, the Investment Manager, their respective members, officers, employees or affiliates, nor 
any person designated to wind up the affairs of the Partnership pursuant to the Partnership Agreement will 
be liable for any loss (including losses due to trade errors caused by such persons) or costs arising out of or 
in connection with any act or activity undertaken (or omitted to be undertaken) in fulfillment of any obligation 
or responsibility under this Agreement, including any such loss sustained by reason of any investment or 
the sale or retention of any security or other asset of the Partnership, except for any person exculpated from 
liability shall not be exculpated from any liability arising from losses caused by his, her or its gross 
negligence, willful misconduct or violations of applicable law. 
The Partnership will, to the fullest extent legally permissible under the laws of the State of 
Delaware, indemnify the General Partner, the Investment Manager, their respective members, officers, 
employees and affiliates and any persons designated to wind up the affairs of the Partnership pursuant to 
the Partnership Agreement (each, an "Indemnitee") from and against any and all loss, liability or expense 
(including without limitation judgments, fines, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and reasonable 
attorney's fees) incurred or suffered in connection with the good faith performance by the Indemnitee of 
their responsibilities to the Partnership; provided, however, that an Indemnitee will not be indemnified for 
losses resulting from his, her or its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or violation of applicable laws. 
To the extent legally permissible, the Partnership will, at the request of the General Partner, advance 
amounts and/or pay expenses as incurred in connection with its indemnification obligation. 
A Limited Partner who does not take part in the management or control of the business of the 
Partnership will not be personally liable for any debt or obligation of the Partnership in excess of such 
Partner's capital account. Under certain circumstances, a Limited Partner may, under Delaware law, be 
required to return for the benefit of creditors amounts previously distributed to him or her. 
Amendment of the Partnership Agreement 
The Partnership Agreement may be amended by the General Partner, at its sole discretion, in any 
manner that does not adversely affect any Limited Partner or to effect any changes required by applicable 
laws or regulations. The Partnership Agreement may also be amended by action of both the General 
Partner and Limited Partners (which consent may be negative) owning a majority-in-interest of the capital 
accounts of all the Limited Partners in any manner that does not discriminate among the Limited Partners. 
Dissolution of the Partnership 
The Partnership may be dissolved at any time by the General Partner, whereupon its affairs will be 
wound up by the General Partner. The retirement, dissolution or bankruptcy of the General Partner will 
dissolve the Partnership unless () at such time there is another general partner who agrees to continue the 
business of the Partnership, or (ii) an entity controlled by Mr. Sparaggis is substituted as general partner to 
continue the business of the Partnership. If there is no remaining general partner who agrees to continue 
the business of the Partnership or an entity controlled by the General Partner is not substituted as general 
partner, the affairs of the Partnership will be promptly wound up by the General Partner, or if the General 
Partner is unavailable, by the person previously designated by the General Partner, or if the General 
Partner has made no such designation, the person selected by a majority in interest of the capital accounts 
of the Limited Partners. Such person will take all steps necessary or appropriate to wind up the affairs of the 
Partnership as promptly as practicable.
