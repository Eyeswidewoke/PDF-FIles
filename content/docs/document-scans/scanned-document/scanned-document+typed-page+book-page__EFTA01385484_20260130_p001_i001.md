Cable / Pay-TV: Market Weight Relative to the DB Index 
The alarm bells around the maturation of the Pay-TV industry have been going 
off for years. Despite clear headwinds that have undoubtedly had negative 
impacts on cash generation, management throughout the industry has done 
well in not only weathering the storm, but positioning their respective 
companies for the future. For the wired cable companies, the natural business 
pivot has been focusing on generating a higher mix of revenue from 
broadband and venturing into commercial, which just so happens to have a 
materially better margin and cash flow profile than the historical linear TV 
business. For DBS, the challenge of reinventing itself has been much more 
difficult considering it doesn't have an HSD offering into the household. While 
DTV got acquired and integrated into a large platform at AT&T that has 
inevitably helped its relevance and extended its lifespan, both DTV and DISH 
saw the writing on the wall early and instead of trying to exclusively protect its 
legacy subscriber base, which is a given, they created two of the industry's 
best OTT products. 
In addition to fighting top-line difficulties, margins have also been under 
pressure as content and programming costs have been increasing at high-
single digit I low-double digit rates for the better part of a decade. The 
response from operators has varied, but recent approaches can all be filed as 
incrementally emboldened compared to even just five years ago prior to the 
Pay-TV market cracking. Certain operators have resorted to going dark on 
channels during negotiations. Others have completely eliminated certain 
programming altogether and substituted with more attractively priced 
alternatives. Then there are those providers like WaveDivision who simply pass 
the cost of programming through to customers. The integration of OTT 
products into the platform is more prevalent and actually lowers churn as the 
complementary features and all-in-one place for access produces a more 
seamless, enjoyable experience particularly via a cross-catalog guide. While 
the OTT marketplace has gained market share and inspired certain 
demographics to cut the cord and will continue to do so over time, we believe 
the worries over linear TV trends are a bit too draconian. For example, in its 
3Q17 Video Trends Report, TiVo points out that the number of respondents in 
its survey that have cut cable within the previous 12 months declined for the 
first quarter since 3Q16. It could just be an outlier, but after trending up 3% y/y 
for the past year, it could also present a data point that supports the notion 
that the biggest wave of cord cutting are the first movers, which is now 
entering its own maturity stage. Should that trend continue declining, that 
presents an even longer tail for linear TV which we believe would help the DBS 
business most given they're more levered to that segment.

We still expect

decreasing at • modenste rate 
with some carders such as DISH 
and ATT offsetting some of these 
losses with lower-ARPU OTT

In terms of cord shaving/cutting,

might be able to oiler some

The
