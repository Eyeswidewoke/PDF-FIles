Our Intellectual Property 
We own a global portfolio of many trademarks. trade names, patents. and other intellectual property that are important to our future 
success. The only intellectual property rights that are individually material to us are the First Data trademark and trade name, and the STAR 
trademark and trade name. The STAR trademark and trade name are used in the Network & Security Solutions segment. The First Data trademark 
and trade name are associated with quality and reliable electronic commerce and payments solutions. Financial institutions and merchants associate 
the STAR trademark and trade name with quality and reliable debit network services and processing services. Loss of the proprietary use of the 
First Data or STAR trademarks and trade names or a diminution in the perceived quality associated with these names could harm the growth of our 
businesses. 
Our Employees 
As of December 31, 2014. we employed approximately 23.000 persons, approximately 97% of which were full-time employees. The 
majority of the employees of our subsidiaries outside of the United States are subject to the terms of individual employment agreements. One of our 
wholly owned subsidiaries has approximately 1,600 employees in the United Kingdom. a portion of whom are members of the Unite trade union. 
Employees of our subsidiaries in Vienna, Austria; Frankfurt Germany; and Nurnberg. Germany are also represented by local works councils. The 
Vienna workforce and a portion of the Frankfurt workforce are also covered by a union contract. Certain employees of our Korean subsidiary are 
represented by a Labor-Management council. In Brazil. every single employee is unionized and covered by the terms of industry-specific collective 
agreements. Employees in certain other countries are also covered by the terms of industry-specific national collective agreements. None of our 
employees are otherwise represented by any labor organization in the United States. We believe that our relations with our employees and the labor 
organizations identified above are in good standing.
