ment which induce one organism to be-
have in a given way will often affect 
another organism when it behaves in the 
same way. An imitative repertoire which 
brings the imitator under the control of 
new contingencies is therefore acquired. 
The human species presumably be-
came much more social when its vocal 
musculature came under operant con-
trol. Cries of alarm, mating calls, aggres-
sive threats, and other kinds of vocal 
behavior can be modified through oper-
ant conditioning, but apparently only 
with respect to the occasions upon which 
they occur or their rate of occurrence 
(2). The ability of the human species to 
acquire new forms through selection by 
consequences presumably resulted from 
the evolution of a special innervation of 
the vocal musculature, together with a 
supply of vocal behavior not strongly 
under the control of stimuli or releas-
ers—the babbling of children from which 
verbal operants are selected. No new 
susceptibility to reinforcement was 
needed because the consequences of 
verbal behavior are distinguished only 
by the fact that they are mediated by 
other people (3). 
The development of environmental 
control over the vocal musculature 
greatly extended the help one person 
receives from others. By behaving ver-
bally people cooperate more successful-
ly in common ventures. By taking ad-
vice, heeding warnings, following in-
structions, and observing rules, they 
profit from what others have already 
learned. Ethical practices are strength-
ened by codifying them in laws, and 
special techniques of ethical and intellec-
tual self-management are devised and 
taught. Self-knowledge or awareness 
emerges when one person asks another 
such a question as "What are you going 
to do?" or "Why did you do that?" The 
invention of the alphabet spread these 
advantages over great distances and pe-
riods of time. They have long been said 
to give the human species its unique 
position, although it is possible that what 
is unique is simply the extension of oper-
ant control to the vocal musculature. 
A Third Kind of Selection 
Verbal behavior greatly increased the 
importance of a third kind of selection by 
consequences, the evolution of social 
environments or cultures. The process 
presumably begins at the level of the 
individual. A better way of making a 
tool, growing food, or teaching a child is 
reinforced by its consequence—the tool, 
the food. or a useful helper, respectively.

A culture evolves when practices origi-
nating in this way contribute to the suc-
cess of the practicing group in solving its 
problems. It is the effect on the group, 
not the reinforcing consequences for in-
dividual members, which is responsible 
for the evolution of the culture. 
In summary, then, human behavior is 
the joint product of (i) the contingencies 
of survival responsible for the natural 
selection of the species and (ii) the con-
tingencies of reinforcement responsible 
for the repertoires acquired by its mem-
ben, including (iii) the special contingen-
cies maintained by an evolved social 
environment. (Ultimately, of course, it is 
all a matter of natural selection, since 
operant conditioning is an evolved pro-
cess, of which cultural practices are spe-
cial applications.) 
Similarities and Differences 
Each of the three levels of variation 
and selection has its own discipline—the 
first, biology; the second, psychology; 
and the third, anthropology. Only the 
second, operant conditioning, occurs at 
a speed at which it can be observed from 
moment to moment. Biologists and 
anthropologists study the processes 
through which variations arise and are 
selected, but they merely reconstruct the 
evolution of a species or culture. Oper-
ant conditioning is selection in progress. 
It resembles a hundred million years of 
natural selection or a thousand years of 
the evolution of a culture compressed 
into a very short period of time. 
The immediacy of operant condition-
ing has certain practical advantages. For 
example, when a currently adaptive fea-
ture is presumably too complex to have 
occurred in its present form as a single 
variation, it is usually explained as the 
product of a sequence of simpler varia-
tions, each with its own survival value. It 
is standard practice in evolutionary the-
ory to look for such sequences, and 
anthropologists and historians have re-
constructed the stages through which 
moral and ethical codes, art, music, liter-
ature, science, technology, and so on, 
have presumably evolved. A complex 
operant, however, can actually be 
"shaped through successive approxima-
tion" by arranging a graded series of 
contingencies of reinforcement (4). 
A current question at level i has paral-
lels at levels ii and iii. If natural selection 
is a valid principle, why do many species 
remain unchanged for thousands or even 
millions of years? Presumably the an-
swer is either that no variations have 
occurred or that those which occurred 
were not selected by the prevailing con-
tingencies. Similar questions may be 
asked at levels ii and iii. Why do people 
continue to do things in the same way for 
many years, and why do groups of peo-
ple continue to observe old practices for 
centuries? The answers are presumably 
the same: either new variations (new 
forms of behavior or new practices) have 
not appeared or those which have ap-
peared have not been selected by the 
prevailing contingencies (of reinforce-
ment or of the survival of the group). At 
all three levels a sudden, possibly exten-
sive, change is explained as due to new 
variations selected by prevailing contin-
gencies or to new contingencies. Compe-
tition with other species, persons, or 
cultures may or may not be involved. 
Structural constraints may also play a 
part at all three levels. 
Another issue is the definition or iden-
tity of a species, person, or culture. 
Traits in a species and practices in a 
culture are transmitted from generation 
to generation, but reinforced behavior is 
"transmitted" only in the sense of re-
maining part of the repertoire of the 
individual. Where species and cultures 
are defined by restrictions imposed upon 
transmission—by genes and chromo-
somes and, say, geographical isolation. 
respectively—a problem of definition (or 
identity) arises at level ii only when 
different contingencies of reinforcement 
create different repertoires. as selves or 
persons. 
Traditional Explanatory Schemes 
As a causal mode, selection by conse-
quences was discovered very late in the 
history of science—indeed, less than a 
century and a half ago—and it is still not 
fully recognized or understood, especial-
ly at levels ii and iii. The facts for which 
it is responsible have been forced into 
the causal pattern of classical mechan-
ics. and many of the explanatory 
schemes elaborated in the process must 
now be discarded. Some of them have 
great prestige and are strongly defended 
at all three levels. Here are four exam-
ples: 
A prior act of creation. (ii Natural 
selection replaces a very special creator 
and is still challenged because it does so. 
(ii) Operant conditioning provides a simi-
larly controversial account of the ("vol-
untary") behavior traditionally attribut-
ed to a creative mind. (iii) The evolution 
of a social environment replaces the sup-
posed origin of a culture as a social 
contract or of social practices as com-
mandments.
