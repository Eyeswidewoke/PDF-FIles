Q: Mr. Epstein, did anyone at Bear Stearns

the staff of the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission? 
A: No. 
Q: Has anyone indicated to you in any way. 
either directly or indirectly. :n words or sub-
stance. that your compensation for this past 
year or any (MIN monies coming to you from 
Bear Stearns will be contingent upon your not 
divulging information to the Securities and 
Exchanee Commission? 
A: No. 
Despite the circumstances of Epstein's 
leaving. Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his 
annual bonus—which he anticipated as be-
ing approximately 5100.000. 
Thi S.E.C. never brought any charges 
against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider 
trading in St. Joe. but its questioning seems 
to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein's 
answers. Some sources have wondered 
why. if he was such a big producer at Bear 
Stearns. he would have given it up over a 
mere 52.500 rine. 
Certainly the years after Epstein left the 
firm were not obviously prosperous ones. 
His luck didn't seem to change until he met 
Hoffenbere. 
rirte of Epstein's first assignments for Hof-
fenberg was to mastermind doomed bids 
to take over Pan American World Airways in 
1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. 
Hoffenberg claimed in a 1993 hearing before 
a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up 
with the :dea of financing these bids through 
Towers's acquisition of two ailing Illinois 
insurance companies. Associated Life and 
United Fire. "He was hired by us to work on 
the securities side of the insurance companies 
and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a 
profit for us and for the companies.' Hoffcn-
berg reportedly told the grand jury. He also 
alleged !hat Epstein aas the "technician." ex-
ecuting the schemes, although. having no 
broker's license, he had to rely on others to 
make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg's sub 
sequent testimony in his criminal case has 
proven to be false, and Epstein has claimed 
he was merely asked how the bids could be 
accomplished and has said he had nothing 
to do with the financing of them. Yet Rich-
ard Allen. the former treasurer of United 
Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three 
times at the company. He and another ex-
ecutive say they had direct dealing with Ep-
stein over the finances. And in his deposition 
of 1989. Epstein stated that he was the one 
who executed "all" Hoffenberg's instructions 
to buy and sell the stock. He called it "mak-
ing the orders." He could not recall whether 
he had chosen the brokers used. 
To win approval from the Illinois insur-
ance regulators for Towers's acquisition of 
the companies. Hoffenberg promised to in-
ject 53 million of new capital into them. In 
fact. in his grand-jury testimony Hoffenberg 
claimed that he, his chief operating officer. 
Mitchell Brater, and Epstein came up with a 
scheme to steal S3 million of the insurance 
companies' bonds to buy Pan Am and Em-
ery stock. - Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Brater 
arranged the various brokerage accounts for 
the bonds to be placed with in New York. 
and I think one in Chicago. Rodman & Ren-
shaw.- Hoffenberg reportedly said. Then. 
said Hoffenberg. while making it appear as 
though they were investing the bonds in 
much safer financial instruments. they used 
them as collateral to buy the stock. "Ep-
stein was the person in charge of the trans-
actions. and Mitchell Brater was assisting 
hint with it in coordination on behalf of the 
insurance companies' money.- Holmberg 
claimed at the time. 
At one point. according to Holmberg. a 
broker forged the documents necessary for a 
SI.8 million check to be written on insurance-
company funds. The check was used to buy 
more stock in the takeover targets. Mean-
while. in order to throw the insurance regula-
tors off the S1.8 million was reported as being 
safely invested in a money-market account. 
United Fire's former chief financial officer 
Daniel Payton confirms part of Hoffenberg's 
account. He says he recalls making one or 
two telephone calls to Epstein tat Holten-
berg's direction) about the missing bonds. 
-He said. 'Oh. yeah. they still exist.' But we 
found out later that he had sold those assets 
... leveraged them .. . [and) used some mar-
gin account to take some positions in .. . 
Emery and Pan Am." says Payton. 
Epstein's extraordinary creativity was. ac-
cording to HotTenberg. responsible for the 
purchase by the insurance companies of a 
$500.000 bond, with no money down. - Ep-
stein created a great scheme to purchase a 
5500.000 treasury bond that would not be 
shown .. . Iasi margined or collateralized." 
he reportedly told the grand jury. "It looked 
like it was free and clear but it actually 
wasn't," he said. 
Epstein has denied he ever had any deal-
ings with anyone from the insurance com-
panies. But Richard Allen says he recalls 
talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg's direction 
and telling him it was urgent they retrieve 
the missing bonds for a state examination. 
According to Allen. Epstein said. "Wet get 
them back.- He had "kind of a flippant atti-
tude: says Allen. "They never came back." 
E
pstein. according to HotTenberg. also 
came up with a scheme to manipulate 
the price of Emery Freight stock in an at-
tempt to minimize the losses that occurred 
when HotTenberg's bid went wrong and the 
share price began to fall. This was alleged to 
have involved multiple clients' accounts con-
trolled by Epstein. 
Eventually. in 1991. insurance regulators in 
Illinois sued Holmberg. He settled the case. 
and Epstein. who was only a paid consul-
tant. was never deposed or accused of any 
wrongdoing. Barry Gross. the attorney who 
was handling the suit for the regulators. says 
of Epstein. "He was very elusive. ... It was 
hard to really track him down. There were a 
substantial number of checks for significant 
dollars that 'sere paid to him. I remem-
ber.... He was this character we never got a 
handle on. Again we presumed that he was 
imohed with the Pan- Am and Emery run 
that Hottenberg made. but we never got a 
chance to depose him." 
"From the government's discovery in the 
main sentencing against HotTenberg it would 
seem the government was perhaps a bit lazy: 
says David Lewis. who represented Mitchell 
Brater. -They went for what they knew they 
could get .. . and that was the fraudulent 
promissory notes 
the much larger and 
unrelated part of Hoffenberg's fraud. based 
in New York State].... What they couldn't 
get. they didn't bother with." 
Another lawyer involved in the criminal 
prosecution of Hoffenberg says. "In a crim-
inal investigation like that. when there is a 
guilty plea. to be quick and dirty about it. 
discovery is always incomplete. ... They 
don't have to line up witnesses: they don't 
have to learn every fact that might come out 
on cross-examination." 
E
pstein was involved with Hotlenberg in 
other questionable transactions. Finan-
cial records show that in 1988 Epstein in-
vested 51.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc.. a 
company that manufactures football helmets. 
.Among his co-investors were the theater 
mogul Robert Nederlander and attorney 
Leonard Toboroft A source close to this 
transaction claims that Epstein told Neder-
lander and ToborotT that he had raised his 
share of the money from a Swiss banker.
