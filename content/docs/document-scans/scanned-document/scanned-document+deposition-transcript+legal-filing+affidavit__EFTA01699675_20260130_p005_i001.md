I have attached. and provided a USB containing 11 files and a report. The 11th file contains 
documented evidence of the motive and source of the targeting and the reason it began and 
continued for over a 30 year period involving Attorney General of SA Vickie Chapman. 
The provided evidence in this file is the final explanation of how and why the targeting began and the 
motive as to why I inperticular had become this target. 
I am contacting you to submit documented evidence to support the reported documented evidence of the 
event that occurred in 2017 while residing in the area of Port Pine, and involved alleged Conspired Police 
targeting involvement , which was confirmed in 2016 and 2020 by two sources confirming that I, the 
targeted victim was in fact a targeted victim of police targeting, which occurred in the periods of 2014-2016 
involving the Port Pine and Crystal Brook (SAPOL) Police Departments, which have been confirmed as 
being connected to Queensland Police Targeting and the individuals connected and involved in Criminal 
Network Targeting of an Individual. The reported event in 2017 involved Conspired Attempted Murder of 
the targeted victim due to her awareness by lethal injection to appear as suicide, which was unsuccessful, 
and then continued Conspired Attempted murder cases following this event occurring in 2018-2020 
involving Australian Government sources involved and an individual connected and involved in Criminal 
network Targeting of an individual, which were also unsuccessful. 
Involved in the 2017 Conspired attack of Conspired Attempted murder of the targeted victim due to her 
awareness by lethal injection to appear as suicide a Government Department, SACAT was involved in the 
Glenside Release from imprisonment / detainment of the mental Health Institution appeal, appeal 
submitted for my release by the targeted victim, myself in January 2017, hearing held involving SACAT 
14th February 2017. The outcome of this hearing involving SACAT was a Conspired Falsified diagnosis of 
Schizophrenia and ordered lethal injections that had suicidal tendencies for a Oeriod of 16 months, and a 
Community Treatment order for 12 months following my release from Glenside, which followed 2 weeks 
following this denied appeal for my release. Prior to this hearing involving SACAT 2 doctors of Glenside, 
Dr Michael Lee and Dr Susan Cosoff, Psychiatrist were involved in Conspired Falsified diagnosis and ille-
gally ordered medications, which commenced the process of the Conspired Attempted murder of the tar-
geted victim due to her awareness by lethal medication / injection to appear as suicide, of which prior to 
this contact I did not have documented evidence to prove. I also prior to this contact could not prove that 
the Australian Government Department SACAT had in fact been involved in the Conspired Attack, but 
were only involved. 
I am now contacting you to submit documented evidence to support the reported illegal Criminally 
Conspired attack of 2017 involving Australian Government sources, Australian Law Enforcement sources, 
and a Criminal Network involving involved individuals and the Government Department SACAT, and in-
cluding Dr Michael Lee and Dr Susan Cosoff and Glenside Mental Health Institute, which concludes the 
reported criminal case and substantiates my report and submitted evidence, Constructed legal Case files, 
previously submitted, and the reported allegation of Multiple Conspired attempted murder reports, which 
has continuously been denied by Multiple Australian Government Departments and Law enforcement in 
Australia and the Australian Government System in the years of involving reporting 2016-2023. 
I have in the year of 2023 contacted the Australian Government Department SACAT and requested ac-
cess to the Freedom of Information Act involving and pertaining to their involvement in 2017 Glenside
