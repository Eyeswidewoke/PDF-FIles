Article VI 
Provisions Concerning Trustees 
Section 6.1. - Successor Trustees 
In the event a Trustee of the Trust resigns, is removed, becomes incapacitated or is unwilling or 
is unable to serve, a successor Trustee shall be appointed to fill the vacancy thereby created, such 
that the total number of Trustees acting on behalf of the Trust at all times shall be two. BORIS 
NIKOLIC shall be appointed to fill any such vacancy, and if he is unwilling or unable to serve, 
BARNABY MARSH shall be appointed to fill any such vacancy. If BARNABY MARSH is 
unwilling or unable to serve, then ANTHONY BARRETT shall be appointed to fill such 
vacancy. If ANTHONY BARRETT is unwilling or unable to serve, then KATHY REUMMLER 
shall be appointed to fill such vacancy. If KATHY REUMMLER is unwilling or unable to serve, 
then DAVID MITCHELL shall be appointed to fill such vacancy. If DAVID MITCHELL is 
unwilling or unable to serve, then STEVE HANSON shall be appointed to fill such vacancy. If 
STEVE HANSON is unwilling or unable to serve, then EVA DUBIN shall be appointed to fill 
such vacancy and thereafter the successor Trustee appointed to fill any such vacancy shall be 
appointed by the Trustees then acting, or, if as a result of said vacancy, only one Trustee is then 
acting, by the sole remaining Trustee then acting. 
Section 6.2. - Appointment of Trustee 
The appointment of a successor Trustee hereunder shall become effective when such successor 
Trustee signs an acceptance of the trust. 
Section 6.3. - Resignation of Trustees 
Any Trustee may resign at any time, without the approval of any court, by an instrument in writing 
fled with the trust records. In addition, if there is filed with the trust records a written certification 
from any attending physician of any individual Trustee of a trust that he or she is no longer able to 
make decisions with respect to such trust, then from the date of filing of such certification, such 
individual 'frustee shall be deemed to have resigned for all purposes of this Agreement. 
Section 6.4. - Vacancy in Office 
If there is a vacancy in the Trustees and no successor Trustee is designated pursuant to Section 7.1 
who is willing to act, the legally competent adult Beneficiary (or a majority in beneficial interest of the 
legally competent adult Beneficiaries if there are multiple Beneficiaries) then entitled or permitted to 
receive income from such trust shall designate a successor Trustee by an instrument in writing 
delivered to the designated Trustee. If the legally competent adult Beneficiaries do not designate a 
successor Trustee within sixty days after receipt of notice of such vacancy or if there is no legally 
competent adult Beneficiary of such trust, then a successor Trustee shall be named by order of a court 
of competent jurisdiction. All of the fees and expenses of the Trustees (including attorneys' fees) 
attributable to the appointment of a successor Trustee of a trust shall be paid from the assets of such 
trust.
