MG. 3. HSV.1 immunostaining of the ganroduodenal jund ion. (A and II) Whole mount,. of the pyloric region from a BAlikc mouse at 7 day, pr. with strain I7-. 
In panel A, the stomach is to the right of the pylorus and the duodenum is to the left. HSV-l-infected myenteric and submucosal ganglia and fibers (staining black) 
art shown. Also shown arc infected penetrating nerves (while arrow) cartied along the mesentery and infected nerves penetrating the pyloric sphincter of the stomach. 
In panel %which is the area enclosed in the box in panel A enlarged, infected submuetsal ganglia (arrowheads) and infected nerve fibers penetrating into the duodenal 
mucosa (mums) are shown. Magnification. x40 (A) and x2CO (R). (C) A section (25 om thick) of proximal duodenum from a BALER mouse at 5 days p.i. with strain 
F showing IISV-I•infected ganglia and nerve fibers in the area of duodenal Brunner'sglands. Magnification, x2fXl. (O) A section (7 pm thick) showing IISV.I.infected 
myenteric and iubmucosal ganglia in the duodenum. Magnification. x MA (E) A section (25 Am thick) showing an infected neuron adjacent to Brumes glands in the 
submucosa. Magnification. x IOW. 
towards the lumina! epithelial layer. In the proximal duode-
num, single and occasionally multiple infected nerve fibers 
were seen spreading towards the tip of an individual duodenal 
villus (Fig. 4). Often these fibers terminated on a single in-
fected mucosal epithelial cell; less often, clusters of infected 
epithelial cells were seen around terminal nerve fibers. Within 
the villus lamina propria, labeled nerve fibers were found in 
contact with virus-infected spindle-shaped cells. These spindle 
cells, characterized by an oval nucleus and several slender 
dendritic-like processes, were identical to cells that Berthoud 
et al. (4) described as being associated with vagus nerve sen-
sory receptors originating from neurons in the nodose ganglia. 
Thus, it is likely that the infected nerve terminals we arc de-
scribing are sensory and also have their origins in the nodose 
ganglia. 
Vagal sensory receptors are known to respond to intralumi-
nal changes, transmitting information throughout the enteric 
and parasympathetic nervous system; they may also be in-
volved in the uptake and dissemination of orally acquired neu-
rotropic herpesviruses. We describe here how after intraesoph-
agcal inoculation, HSV-I spreads to infect multiple layers of 
the intrinsic enteric nervous system and to infect mucosal 
nerve fibers believed to be vagal sensory receptors. Peripheral 
sensory receptors in the gut consist of free nerve endings rather 
than specialized receptors, as found elsewhere in the body (5, 
16, 22. 23, 27). It has long been questioned whether these 
mucosal afferent fibers interact directly with lumina! epithelial 
cells and whether sensory nerve endings can directly sample 
the intraluminal contents. Recently, Berthoud et al. have 
shown vagus nerve sensory endings in the rat duodenal mucosa 
by injecting the neurotracer Dil directly into the nodose gan-
glia (4). These vagal afferent terminal fibers, originating from 
sensory neurons in the nodose ganglia, were found to connect 
with enteric ganglia in both the myenteric and submucous 
plexuses and to arborize terminally within the villus lamina 
propria in close contact with surface epithelial cells. It has been 
suggested that these terminal nerve endings, positioned as they 
are, may be able to directly sample the lumen or relay infor-
mation from surface epithelial cells and essentially function 
like taste cells of the luminal contents. Similarly, peripheral 
vagal afferent receptors have also been identified in the gastric 
mucosa. concentrated around the prepyloric region (22, 27). 
We previously showed in immunodeficient (SOD) animals 
that HSV-I spread in the nervous system is determined by the 
innervation of the initial inoculation site and that the virus 
dots not spread indiscriminately, for example. by the circula-
tion (18). It is highly likely that virus inoculated in the esoph-
ageal lumen also reaches the mucosa of the stomach and small 
intestine, where it can apparently access the enteric nerve 
network; in immunocompetent mice, we have seen significant 
viral infection in the pyloric region without any apparent in-
fection of the esophageal enteric nerves. The finding of Bud-
