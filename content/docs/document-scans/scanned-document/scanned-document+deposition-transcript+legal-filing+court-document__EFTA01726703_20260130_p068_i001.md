Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC):We use the Average 
Daily Balance method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by aPPleg 
the daily periodicrate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for each feature (such as Purchase, Cash 
Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (including current transactions). To get the Average Daily 
Balance for each feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid FC from previous 
billing periods), (2) add any now transactions, 
or foes, (3) subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any 
appropriate adustrnents. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also add an amount of 
interest equal to the previous clay's daily balance multiplied by the daily periodic rate lot the feature. 
This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for the next day. If
balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the feature for the billing period 
and divide the total by the number of days in the biting period. This gives us the Average Daily Balance for the feature. For 
all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance will be considered to be zero if You 
paid the New Balance if any, shown on your previous month'sstatement by the Payment Due Date shown on that 
statement. If you rarity the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number of days in the biting period and the 
daily periodic rate for at feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that feature, except for variations caused
pouncing. The total FC for the billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all features of the Account. This 
method of calculteing the Average Daily Belem* end FC results in daily compounding of FC. The minimum 
FC for any billing period in which FC are imposed is $0.50.
