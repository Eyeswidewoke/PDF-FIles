(the "Contractual Currency") save as provided in paragraph 1O(c)(ii). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the payee of any money may, at its option, 
accept tender thereof in any other currency, provided, however, that, to the 
extent permitted by applicable law, the obligation of the payer to pay such 
money will be discharged only to the extent of the amount of the Contractual 
Currency that such payee may, consistent with normal banking procedures, 
purchase with such other currency (after deduction of any premium and costs 
of exchange) for delivery within the customary delivery period for spot 
transactions in respect of the relevant currency. 
If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency received by a 
party, including amounts received after conversion of any recovery under any 
judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual 
Currency, falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency due and 
payable, the party required to make the payment will, as a separate and 
independent obligation, to the extent permitted by applicable law, 
immediately transfer such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as 
may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. 
If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency received by a party 
exceeds the amount of the Contractual Currency due and payable, the party 
receiving the transfer will refund promptly the amount of such excess. 
8. 
Substitution 
A Transaction may at any time between the Purchase Date and Repurchase Date, 
if Seller so requests and Buyer so agrees, be varied by the transfer by 
Buyer to Seller of Securities equivalent to the Purchased Securities, or to 
such of the Purchased Securities as shall be agreed, in exchange for the 
transfer by Seller to Buyer of other Securities of such amount and 
description as shall be agreed ("New Purchased Securities") (being 
Securities having a Market Value at the date of the variation at least equal 
to the Market Value of the Equivalent Securities transferred to Seller). 
Any variation under subparagraph (a) above shall be effected, subject to 
paragraph 6(d), by the simultaneous transfer of the Equivalent Securities 
and New Purchased Securities concerned. 
A Transaction which is varied under subparagraph (a) above shall thereafter 
continue in effect as though the Purchased Securities under that Transaction 
consisted of or included the New Purchased Securities instead of the 
Securities in respect of which Equivalent Securities have been transferred 
to Seller. 
Where either party has transferred Margin Securities to the other party it 
may at any time before Equivalent Margin Securities are transferred to it 
under paragraph 4 request the other party to transfer Equivalent Margin 
Securities to it in exchange for the transfer to the other party of new 
Margin Securities having a Market Value at the time of transfer at least 
equal to that of such Equivalent Margin Securities. If the other party 
agrees to the request, the exchange shall be effected, subject to paragraph 
6(d), by the simultaneous transfer of the Equivalent Margin Securities and 
new Margin Securities concerned. Where either or both of such transfers is 
or are effected through a settlement system in circumstances which under the 
rules and procedures of that settlement system give rise to a payment by or 
for the account of one party to or for the account of the other party, the
