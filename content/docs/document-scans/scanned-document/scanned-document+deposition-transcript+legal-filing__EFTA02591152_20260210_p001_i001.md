Let's be honest, Islam has a problem right now 
Please scroll down or Fareed Zakaria's latest Washington post Let's be honest, Islam has a problem right now By Fareed 
Zakaria, Thursday, October 9, 2014 The Washington Post 
When television host Bill Maher declares on his weekly show that "th= Muslim world ... has too much in common with 
ISIS =9D and guest Sam Harris says that Islam is "the mother lode of bad i=eas," I understand why people are upset. 
Maher and Harris, an autho=, made crude simplifications and exaggerations. And yet, they were also tal=ing about 
something real. 
I know the arguments against speaking of Islam as violent and reactionary. 1= has a following of 1.6 billion people. Places 
such as Indonesia and India h=ve hundreds of millions of Muslims who don't fit these caricatures.=That's why Maher and 
Harris are guilty of gross generalizations. Bu= let's be honest. Islam has a problem today. The places that have t=ouble 
accommodating themselves to the modern world are disproportionately M=slim. 
In 2013, of the top 10 groups that perpetrated terrorist attacks, seven were=Muslim. Of the top 10 countries where 
terrorist attacks took place, seven w=re Muslim-majority. The Pew Research Center rates countries on the level 
of-restrictions that governments impose on the free exercise of religion. Of t=e 24 most restrictive countries, 19 are 
Muslim-majority. Of the 21 countrie= that have laws against apostasy, all have Muslim majorities. 
There is a cancer of extremism within Islam today. A small minority of Musli=s celebrates violence and intolerance and 
harbors deeply reactionary attitu=es toward women and minorities. While some confront these extremists, not e=ough 
do so, and the protests are not loud enough. How many mass rallies hav= been held against the Islamic State (also 
known as ISIS) in the Arab world=today? 
The caveat, "Islam today," is important. The central problem=with Maher's and Harris's analyses are that they take a 
rea=ity — extremism in Islam — and describe it in ways that sug=est it is inherent in Islam. Maher says Islam is "the only 
religion=that acts like the Mafia, that will [expletive] kill you if you say the wro=g thing, draw the wrong picture or write 
the wrong book." He'= right about the viciousness but wrong to link it to "Islam"=— instead of "some Muslims." 
Harris prides himself on being highly analytical — with a PhD, no le=s. I learned in graduate school that you can never 
explain a variable pheno=enon with a fixed cause. So, if you are asserting that Islam is inherently v=olent and intolerant 
— "the mother lode of bad ideas"=— then, since Islam has been around for 14 centuries, we should hav= seen 14 
centuries of this behavior. 
Harris should read Zachary Karabell's book "Peace Be Upon Yo=: Fourteen Centuries of Muslim, Christian and Jewish 
Conflict and Cooperati=n." What he would discover is that there have been wars but also ma=y centuries of peace. Islam 
has at times been at the cutting edge of modern=ty, but like today, it has also been the great laggard. As Karabell 
explain=d to me, "If you exclude the last 70 years or so, in general the Is=amic world was more tolerant of minorities 
than the Christian world. That =80 s why there were more than a million Jews living in the Arab world unt=1 the early 
1950s — nearly 200,000 in Iraq alone." 
If there were periods when the Islamic world was open, modern, tolerant and p=aceful, this suggests that the problem is 
not in the religion's ess=nce and that things can change once more. So why is Maher making these comm=nts? I 
understand that as a public intellectual he feels the need to speak w=at he sees as the unvarnished truth (though his
