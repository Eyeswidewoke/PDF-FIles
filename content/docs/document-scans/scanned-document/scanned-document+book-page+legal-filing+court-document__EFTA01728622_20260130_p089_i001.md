parades, rock concerts, and other events open to the public. These photographs 
are usually of children of a certain age and gender. 
Pedophiles are also more likely to take and possess photographs that focus on 
certain parts of a child's anatomy of particular sexual interest to a certain offender. 
In some photographs the children may be involved in stiange or bizarre behav-
ior, such as pretending to be dead or simulating unusual sex acts. In one case a 
pedophile photographed young boys with painted bondage-like markings on their 
bodies. 
Investigators should make every effort to determine the circumstances under 
which recovered photographs were taken in order.to evaluate their investigative 
significance as child pornography. Any photograph that can be linked to abuse or 
exploitation has a greater chance of being found sexually explicit by the courts. 
The sequence in which the photographs were taken, which can sometimes be 
determined from the negatives, can be an important part of the evaluation. 
Recovered videotapes must be listened to as well as observed to evaluate their 
significance. 
As previously stated many offenders did not "produce" any or many of the 
photographs in their collections. For these recipient/collectors how, when, where, 
why, and with what they obtained their photographs is important. The fact that 
the offender knowingly purchased, traded, exchanged, or downloaded the pho-
tographs in a sexually explicit context or setting is significant. This is most easily 
determined in online-computer cases. The fact that the offender used false pre-
tenses or theft to obtain the photographs could also be significant. 
How They Were Saved Investigators should consider factors such as the location 
where the images were found, labels on the images, package markings, modifica-
tions, and computer file names. Volume is also a significant factor here. Pedophiles 
are more likely to have large numbers of photographs of children. One pedophile 
had 27 large photo albums filled with pictures of children partially or fully dressed. 
They are more likely to have their photographs carefully organized, cataloged, 
and mounted in binders or albums. These may be photographs they cut out of 
magazines, catalogs, or newspapers. Sometimes sexually explicit captions are 
written above, below, or on the pictures. 
Photographs are frequently marked with the children's names and ages and 
the dates taken. Sometimes they are also marked with the children's addresses, 
physical descriptions, and even the sexual acts they performed. Most people who 
have photographs of their naked children or grandchildren save them as a small 
part of a wide collection. The pedophile who collects photographs of children is 
more likely to have hundreds of such photographs together, and all the children 
portrayed will be of the same general age. There will be few, if any, photographs 
of these same children when they are older. The pedophile offender is also more 
likely to have enlargements or carefully arranged groupings of these photographs—
even arranged on the wall as a kind of shrine to children. Some material may be 
placed where child victims will have easy access to it. 
Because this context is potentially so important, investigators should carefully 
observe and meticulously document for future testimony how the offender saved 
such photographs and where they recovered them. Prosecutors must ensure that 
jurors understand the pedophile's collection of photographs of naked children is 
not the same as those saved by some normal parents and relatives.
