Susana Duncan blog on opiate epidemic 
Hi Jeff 
Thanks for a great meeting. If you need any help to find a geisha =o train a robot, I have just the person in Tokyo. 
Below is Susana =uncan blog on how doctors, responding to the incentives in health =ystem, accelerate the opiate 
epidemic.

Is Managed Care Pushing Addiction 
By Dr.Susana Duncan 
America's new addiction, which I wrote about in June in the Huffington =ost, is the epidemic of opiate pain killers, which, 
aptly named, last =ear resulted in over 16,000 overdose deaths. This is not the =tereotyped drug problem that can be 
solved by Miami Vice style drug =usts of traffickers and periodic round-up of street-addicts and =ushers. In this 
epidemic, the traffickers are our respected =harmaceutical companies acting entirely within the law seeking only to 
=ring legitimate pain relief to sufferers; the addicts are, for the =ost part, upstanding citizens seeking a medical solution 
to their =ain, and the "pushers" are, with few exceptions, dedicated doctors =ttempting to alleviate the suffering of their 
patients. So how can the =nteraction of decent people, pursuing well intentioned and legitimate =nds, result in a truly 
disastrous narcotics epidemic? 
The answer, as counter-intuitive as it may seems, is that in large part =he epidemic is an unanticipated consequence of 
"managed are"; which =wept the country in the 1980's to contain rising medical costs. 
Almost every week, I have received more calls from new patients =earching for a pain specialist willing to take on the 
prescribing of =heir drug. In each case the reason given for the need for a new doctor =as their previous doctor's retiring 
or otherwise no longer being =vailable for the task. In each case a brief interview revealed the =ature of the injury or 
physical problem to be either minor or at best =artially diagnosed. Further, there is a turn of phrase, an urgency, a =orn 
thin quality to their stories, which informs the practiced =istener that driving the call is addiction. The previous 
prescriber =ad created a demon and had withdrawn. 
As I reflect on why this wave of opiate addiction is so rapidly gaining =old in America, I realize that the answer lies in the 
new realities of =ow doctors must practice to earn their livelihood. Listening to Bill =linton, the only campaign speaker to 
try to get across the mechanics =f Obamacare, I learned for the first time where the funding ($617 =illion) for the 
proposed expansion of medical insurance coverage was =o come from: Hospitals, private insurers and doctors. 
A proposed 27% cut in Medicare payments to physicians, already so low =s to drive many physicians to refuse to see 
Medicare patients, is part =f the agreed legislation. It is not clear that private medical =ractice as we know it will survive 
at all under these cuts. In the =ast five years physicians have annually fought off a pending far =mailer cut, as the austere 
economics of managed care compels them to =ompromise and see increasing numbers of patients each hour. This 
=equisite for what government administrators might call =93efficiency", cuts deeply into a commodity precious to 
diagnosis =nd patient care, especially precious in pain management; adequate time =or listening, for which, under 
managed care, there is no commensurate =eimbursement. Pain has its own special, unfortunate place in this new =ut-
costs at all cost system. Back and neck problems, vague complaints =f limb pain can be challenging at the best of times 
and may take long =nd repeated visits, interviewing and examining to fathom and correctly =reat. It takes not so much 
diligence as time to apply skill in getting =o the bottom of some of these complaints. And time is what is rationed =nder 
this new system. In this time-is-at-a-premium climate one =nderstands how for a harried physician, prescribing a pain 
killer =ecomes an expedient substitute for a lengthy diagnostic encounter. =ndeed, in the last decade, the use of opiates 
in general practice pain =anagement has become increasingly the norm. The sad truth is that =nder economic exigency 
prescribing in all fields, whether it be drugs =r expensive laboratory or imaging testing, is dramatically escalating; =oo
