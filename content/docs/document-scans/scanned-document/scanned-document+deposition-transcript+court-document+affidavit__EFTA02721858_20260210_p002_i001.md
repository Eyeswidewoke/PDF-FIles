We do it in NYC or London, depending on the draft list 
I front the initiative, as above 
You fund up to 15 people's travel 
ones (if they wish to bring them; 
stipend of 400 USD a day for each 
can claim personally or ask to be 
(delegates), and also their plus 
not to the seminar though), and also a 
participant who requests it, which they 
donated to an organisation. 
You agree that you will provide at least XXXX USD for each of 2 
specific project proposals to be agreed by the end of the 3 days (proposals 
that meet the stated ambition - i.e. activities which practically 
contribute towards a fundamental transformation of monetary systems - and 
that involve a number of the participants, and can be managed by a 501c3). 
I could manage the follow up liaison with the proposal leads, in order to 
ensure they meet your expectations and the spirit of the meeting. 
I commit that the insights from the event will a) shape the 
introduction and conclusion to the book Im finishing in December, called 
"Healing Capitalism" (but with Chatham House rules, so complete 
confidentiality for the individuals involved) and b) inform the programme 
of research, dialogue and training that I will develop at the new Institute 
Im setting up at the Uni of Cumbria. 
We hire a professional facilitator to ensure the meeting moves in a 
dynamic way to achieve specific insights and proposals (Id work with the 
facilitator in designing the day and in hosting the discussions on the day) 
We organise a good party and let them invite some friends (e.g. I have 
about 6 friends in NYC including a pop star and a model, and about 10 
friends in London including some really interesting people). 
Is that OK? In which case, the key question is: what range of 
investment/donation would you be willing to consider for a couple of 
specific projects or programmes of work coming out of this day? What we are 
doing could be unique, and stating a figure would help people get a sense 
of how ambitious they can be in their thinking in the lead up and during 
this meeting. Sadly, at present, the big money is for cautious work. For 
instance, New Economics Foundation are in a consortium who have been 
awarded 5 million Euros from the EU to develop and study 6 local 
currencies, where the currency systems we believe are fundamentally 
flawed/limited. 
I have drafted a letter that could be the one Id send to invitees, so you 
see how I think it could be framed/pitched. Once you give me the green 
light to these ideas, Ill 
a) draft an initial delegate list for you to add to, 
b) prepare an MoU so we are clear on the agreement and eventual costs e.g. 
I would then start to record and bill for my time in the process of project 
development and delivery (I presume phone calls with some potential 
participant will be necessary to explain and then ensure their commitment).
