Erin Burnett: Or he'll go, if he doesn't change? 
Shaikh Mohammed: Yeah. 
Erin Burnett: The idea about the Emirates is different, you have accomplished 
things that other countries have not, but it is not a democracy either, so 
explain how it works. 
Shaikh Mohammed: We are, you know, tribes, we must save our people, we must get 
the education, the universities, the hospitals, housing and no tax here and the 
government has the wealth to spend on the people. 
Erin Burnett: No tax! A lot of people on the street love that, "So what do you 
like about Dubai?" "No tax, no tax!" 
Shaikh Mohammed: Yeah, no tax and the government is working, like today in the 
cabinet, we made the program, we have our vision and we're going through it. We 
are achieving that vision, you know, the dream. We are getting there. Here, it is 
different. Here, where everybody can come to the ruler and say, well I didn't get 
this or that, or this department or this ministry didn't give me my right. 
Erin Burnett: They come to you? 
Shaikh Mohammed: They come to me. 
Erin Burnett: And they directly ask you, you didn't do this or I want that and 
then you have to answer to individual person. 
Shaikh Mohammed: Yes, and he will complain about one ministry, so I will get hold 
of the minister and ask him why you didn't do your job. So, transparency here is 
more. 
Erin Burnett: There were five activists recently here in the UAE, some of them 
dissidents, a blogger; they were sentenced to two or three years in jail, they 
were pardoned on National Day. Amnesty international is calling them the UAE 5, 
how did that happen? Because in my understanding is that one of them was saying 
that all of the free things in UAE, the free health care, the free education, no 
taxes, he said it was "buying off the people" trying to give them money so 
they're happy, so they don't demand change like in Egypt or like in Syria. So 
what's your view of what happened and whether it is ok to say something like that 
here? 
Shaikh Mohammed: If you are a criminal, you'll go to court, you know. Not 
everybody is really perfect, and we are not perfect, you know. We are doing a lot 
for our people with still more to do. So, we hope all these five also will become 
better citizens for their own good and for their people. 
Erin Burnett: This just leads to the question of one thing over the year that 
covering the UAE, people would say the press isn't totally free, people can't 
really say everything that they think. Do you think that that's part of how, in 
this society, you need to govern? 
Shaikh Mohammed:As long as they don't say something wrong about a person or 
whatever it is they can say anything they want. As I told you, we are not perfect 
we are still learning, we are trying to do our job right, and we are trying to 
help our people. We have our own democracy; you can't transfer your democracy to 
us. We differ, for example, our democracy is coming from the Qura'an and as long 
as you don't step on somebody else, you are free to do what you like.
