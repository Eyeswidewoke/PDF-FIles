Here is Alan Stopck's response to my email yesterday: 
Story, 
These photos represent two general principles: 
1. The overwhelming majority of photos represent plants in the pool area suffering from sun burn and 
heat damage. Beginning in the last week of September and thru the first 2.5 weeks in October, 
south Florida experienced record breaking temperatures on a daily level. Heat indexes were pushed to 
100-106 degrees consistently during this window. The `brown 
leafed- Cordylines and Neoregelia Bromeliads are the prime examples of this environmental 
condition. Landscape maintenance cannot prevent those damages. And, very honestly, those 
particular plant species are normally acclimated to full sun conditions. Both are often produced in full 
sun conditions however the unusual weather pattern altered their tolerance levels. 
This problem is 
being experienced throughout south Florida and with a large variety of plant species. We are now 
seeing clear changes to plant tolerances regularly because of the new weather patterns. We are even 
witnessing bloom cycles change because of the new weather conditions. The overwhelming majority 
of the sun burn and heat damage to these and some other plant species around the grounds occurred 
during this period of unusually high temperatures. 
The purple Pentas found in 3 pool locations are in poor condition now. Mr. Epstein, as you clearly 
know, requested for a change of plant specie there. Efflorescence accommodated that request by 
presenting numerous plant alternatives, all of which were turned down. I was informed by you that I 
should maintain the existing Pentas in 2 our of 3 of the locations. I was asked to install aggregate 
where the Pentas reside under the Coconut palm. We did that immediately after the instruction. 
3. There are "blanks" in the landscape (spaces with no plants), even though they are quite minor in 
square footage and space. Landscape Maintenance does not add new plants to those blank 
areas. The client requests those areas to be filled with additional or new plants. That request never 
was presented to Efflorescence at any time and by anyone on the grounds or office. 
These two points cover the general thrust of your photos. Are there day to day problems with specific 
plants? Of course, this happens in every landscape on every property. Plants are constructed of live 
tissues and cells. They are sensitive to every environmental and cultural condition thrust 
upon them. Temperatures, precipitation or lack of, insects and diseases and even the age of individual 
plants influence and impact their health, growth and overall appearance. There is not such a thing as 
perfection in the plant world or the man make landscape. 
Efflorescence and the site's gardener worked hard in each visit trying to make the grounds look as good 
as it can. The bulk of your photos indicate environmental consequences to a small minority of plants 
that were exposed directly to the unusual weather pattern experience recently. When Mr. Epstein 
informed me of a probation period, he pointed to particular areas of concern. Those 
included the purple Pentas, the exposed irrigation drip lines and the need to maintain clean lines 
in the Ficus hedge rows (in the pool area) and the general sanitation of the grounds. I have already 
addressed the Pentas issue. The other areas of contention were handles regularly. The Ficus hedge 
has been maintained in a neat and clean trim, mulch was added immediately to cover any exposed 
irrigation lines and all weed populations, no matter how minor, were eliminated. We listened to his 
concerns and followed through. However, I cannot control some plant damages from natural 
occurrences and that really is what your photos reveal. 
I have been on Mr. Epstein's property for many years. I have always conducted my business in a 
thoughtful and professional manner. My gardeners have done a very good job in
