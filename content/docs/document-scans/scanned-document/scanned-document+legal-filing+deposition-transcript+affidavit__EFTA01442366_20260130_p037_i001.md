GLDUS139 Third Lake Capital 
Underlying Fund Carried 
Interest 
As described in detail in Section 6 — "Distributions" in the Underlying 
Fund PPM (attached hereto in Appendix A), the Glendower GP is 
entitled to receive "carried interest" distributions equal to 12.5% of the 
Underlying Fund's net profits subject to an eight percent (8%) preferred 
return with a full catch up provision for the Glendower GP. The actual 
amount of any such carried interest payment is based in part upon the 
Underlying Fund's achievement of certain returns. The foregoing 
description is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the 
Underlying Fund LPA, and prospective investors must review the 
Underlying Fund documents for a detailed description of the manner in 
which the Underlying Fund intends to make carried interest 
distributions. 
Indemnification 
The Investment Manager, the General Partner, any affiliate thereof and, 
the respective partners, members, stockholders, officers, directors, 
managers, employees, or agents of any of the foregoing and the 
Administrator, will be indemnified by the Access Fund out of the assets 
of the Access Fund, including the capital calls from the Limited Partners 
(which capital calls for indemnification expenses are outside of a 
Limited Partner's Subscription), and from the proceeds of liability 
insurance and any assets from any recalled Distributions (see "— Capital 
Calls"), against certain expenses or losses. In addition, as an investor in 
the Underlying Fund, the Access Fund (and indirectly the Limited 
Partners (including any Feeder Funds)) will be obligated to fund certain 
indemnification obligations of the Underlying Fund, and such amounts 
will be callable from Limited Partners of the Access Fund to the full 
extent of the Access Fund's obligations to the Underlying Fund, 
including through the recall of distributions. 
Withdrawal and Transfer 
Limited Partners may not withdraw from the Access Fund prior to its 
dissolution, provided that a Limited Partner may, with the consent of the 
General Partner in accordance with the terms of the Partnership 
Agreement, transfer its Interests to a Feeder Fund. In addition, Limited 
Partners may not sell, assign or transfer any of their Interests, rights or 
obligations in the Access Fund except with the consent of the General 
Partner, and such consent may be withheld or delayed in the sole and 
absolute discretion of the General Partner. Should the General Partner 
consent to a sale, transfer, assignment or other disposition of a Limited 
Partner's Interest, the transferring Limited Partner or its transferee will 
be required to pay Transfer Expenses (as defined in the Partnership 
Agreement), which shall be at least $5,008 and shall be sufficient to pay 
all costs incurred in connection with any such transfer. Any transferring 
Limited Partner and such Limited Partner's transferee shall, jointly and 
severally, be required to reimburse the Partnership, at the request of the 
General Partner, for any expenses reasonably incurred by the Partnership 
in connection with such Transfer. The General Partner may require the 
complete or partial withdrawal of a Limited Partner in certain limited 
instances (as described in the Partnership Agreement). Transfer
