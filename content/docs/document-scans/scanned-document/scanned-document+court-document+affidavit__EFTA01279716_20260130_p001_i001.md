to Borrower; 
WHEREAS, Lender and Borrower desire to set forth the general requirements and conditions for

as it deems necessary for the approval of the credit, terms, the documentation of the associated 
Advance, and the perfection of Lender's security interests; 
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree that it is appropriate to enter into this Master Loan and 
Security Agreement in order to set forth general terms and conditions that shall be applicable to each 
Advance and the Loan and to establish the framework for the making of future Advances and the

processes and any such Commitment at the time of an Advance shall only be made upon and evidenced 
by the completion and execution of written documentation satisfactory to Lender in all respects and in its 
sole discretion.
