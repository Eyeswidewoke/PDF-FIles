the president's accusations are wrong. They also are 
dangerous." She concludes, "America's institutions are 
robust, but the administration's response to the whistleblower 
poses significant risks. Americans cannot afford to take the 
resilience of our national security process or U.S. democracy 
for granted. And that means we must recognize the 
professionalism of the whistleblower and others who have 
come forward and not let the President's attack distract from 
the damage being done to our democracy.* 
Opinion: All CIA Analysts Are Whistle-blowers, 
Committed To Absolute Objectivity. In an op-ed in the 
Livingston County (MI) Daily Press & Argus (11114), former 
CIA officer Jay Grusin writes, "After a 29-year career with the 
CIA...I can state unequivocally that attempts to discredit the 
whistleblower with these charges are inconsistent with why 
and how analysts do their work and conduct themselves. I 
believe these qualities made the memo so credible." He 
contends, "I know the whistle-blower is passionately 
committed to that oath, to telling truth to power, and to 
absolute objectivity in providing decision-making support to 
the president and his team 2417 regardless of who is in the 
White House." He concludes, "The whistle-blower's memo 
holds to the highest analytic standards. Note upfront the clear 
explanation of why it was written and the careful description 
of sources and the forthright acknowledgment of the absence 
of direct access to events. Most important, rather than coming 
to any judgment, the memo clearly explains what is known 
and calls for further investigation." 
WPost Al Examines How CIA Analyst Led To 
Impeachment Inquiry. In a more than 5,300-word front-
page article headlined 'How A CIA Analyst, Alarmed By 
Trump's Shadow Foreign Policy, Triggered An Impeachment 
Inquiry: the Washington Post (11/15, Miller, Jaffe, Sonne, 
14.2M) reflects on how the "relatively junior CIA employee" in 
August spent two weeks looking at 'notes of alarming 
conversations with White House officials, reviewed details 
from interagency memos on the U.S. relationship with 
Ukraine and scanned public statements by President Trump. 
He wove this material into a nine-page memo outlining 
evidence that Trump had abused the powers of his office to 
try to coerce Ukraine into helping him get reelected. Then, on 
Aug. 12, the analyst hit 'send.- The Post bases its article "on 
interviews with dozens of U.S. and Ukrainian officials, the 
whistleblower report, the White House call record and 
thousands of pages of impeachment hearing transcripts. 
Many officials and others spoke on the condition of 
anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the issue and fear of 
retaliation.-
Conway: Trump Is Being Deprived Of Due Process. 
Appearing on CNN (11/14, 802K) Thursday, White House 
Counselor Kellyanne Conway described President Trump as 
"very placid" after Wednesday's testimony. Conway 
continued, 'I'll tell you why. There was nothing new 
yesterday. ... In a real court of law we'd not be referring to 
something as evidence that is, 'Oh, someone on my staff 
recalled overhearing a conversation between someone else 
and the President where they think they heard the President 
use the word 'investigations.' This is not what due process 
and the rule of law in our great democracy allows. And we 
can't have a lower standard for the President of the United 
States. We certainly shouldn't have a lower standard for the 
impeachment and removal of a democratically elected 
President." According to Conway, Taylor "admitted he had no 
idea what the President was thinking about Ukraine." Conway 
added, He wasn't on the original call and he has never been 
in a meeting with the President. He's never met the 
President. That's important." 
On Fox News' Fox & Friends (11/14, 831K), Conway 
said as a result of Wednesday's hearing, 'We learned 
Democrats have really no case against the President. If this 
was a real court of law and not Adam Schiffs kangaroo court, 
objections would have been flying from any reasonable 
attorney to saying, 'hey, we just discovered that a staffer of 
mine overheard a conversation somebody else was having 
with the President in a restaurant.' This is not admissible in a 
court of law. I think that is why the President and people like 
Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
have said, 'we want to know what the whistleblower said in 
the first place because we need to confront our accuser."' 
Conway added, 'The President is being treated unfairly. I 
think those 31 Democrats who won in 2018 in districts Trump 
and Pence carried in 2016 are watching this most closely, 
much more closely than the country is." 
Franklin Graham: Impeachment Hearing "Day Of 
Shame For America." 
The Washington Times (11/13, 
Harper, 492K) reports "evangelist Franklin Graham has not 
been shy about rallying the faithful to support President 
Trump and his administration," and now "has issued both a 
judgment call on the events and another plea for prayer." 
Graham said in a statement, 'It's a day of shame for America. 
The media is calling the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry 
'historic' and it is — historically shameful. That our politicians 
would bring this kind of harm to our country over a phone call, 
with the world watching, is unbelievable. ... As Christians, as 
those who follow and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, let us 
pray throughout the day and all of these proceedings. Pray 
for our nation, pray for our leaders, and pray for President 
Donald J. Trump.' The President took to Twitter to write, 
"Thank you @FranklinGraham. It is a time of 'shame' for our 
Country. The Democrats know what they are doing is wrong!' 
Social Platforms Prove To Be No Place To Shield A 
Whistle-Blower's Name. 
The New York Times (11/14, 
Frenkel, 18.61M) reports that social media platforms are 
adding a degree of difficulty to shielding the name of a 
government whistle-blower whose complaint set the US 
House on the road to an impeachment inquiry. In the past 
week, a possible name for that person 'has been shared 
thousands of times on Facebook. Videos discussing the
