Portfolio Manager. The term "Portfolio Manager" shall mean a third-
party manager engaged by the Investment Manager on behalf of the Partnership to perform 
investment and/or trading services for the Partnership. 
(I) 
Securities. The term "Securities" shall have the meaning provided in 
Section 2.1(a) below, except where the context indicates otherwise. 
(m) 
Valuation of Securities and Other Property. For purposes of determining 
the value of Securities and other property, as determined by the General Partner, the Partnership, 
in general, values portfolio securities at their last available public sale price in the case of 
securities or contracts listed on any established securities exchange or contract market or any 
comparable over-the-counter securities or contracts, unless not available, in which case it shall 
be at the average of the last reported bid and asked price. In special circumstances in which the 
General Partner determines that market prices or quotations do not fairly represent the value of 
particular assets, the General Partner is authorized to assign a value to such assets which differs 
from the market prices or quotations. The value of assets which are not publicly traded are 
recorded at their fair value as determined by the General Partner. In these circumstances, the 
General Partner shall attempt to use consistent and fair valuation criteria and may (but is not 
required to) obtain independent appraisals of such assets at the expense of the Partnership. All 
valuations determined by the General Partner shall be final and conclusive as to all parties.

invested in the Partnership shall mean the last day of each calendar quarter, or any other date 
upon which the General Partner, in its discretion, permits the withdrawal of capital.

with risk management and due diligence of existing and prospective investments and Portfolio
