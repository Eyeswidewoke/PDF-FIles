A F o i mai control points 
As referred to elsewhere in this presentation, the Team expects to contract with various third parties for purposes of providing sourcing. audit. engineering, design. commissioning. construction. 
installation, energy usage measurement and monitoring. and invoicing services to projects. Although the Partnership has identified likely thad.party service providers it intends to retain to provide 
these services. there can be no assurance that these serace providers will be available to the Partnership at a reasonable cost and/or for the team of the Partnership or that, if a particular service 
provider is not available for a particular project or is deemed not to be qualified for a particular project, adequate alternative service providers will be available at a reasonable cost 
Although the Partnership expects to apply these processes with respect to each of its projects, it may adjust. simplify, tailor or eliminate certain aspects of these processes in the context of particular 
projects based on project risk. complexity and cumulative Team experience.
