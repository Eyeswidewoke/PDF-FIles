aircraft by Borrower or thereafter acquired by Borrower, and all substitutions, additions, replacements, 
and returns of the Parts attached to, installed on, or incorporated into such aircraft or the Equipment; and 
(C) any and all manuals, logbooks, flight records, maintenance records, and other historical records or 
information of Borrower relating to the aircraft, the Equipment, or the Parts, whether owned on the date 
of acquisition of the aircraft by Borrower or thereafter acquired by Borrower (collectively all of the 
foregoing, the "Aircraft"), which Aircraft shall also include Parts and Equipment temporarily uninstalled 
from, de-installed from, or unattached to, the aircraft (or other Equipment), (Y) where such Parts and 
Equipment were previously attached to, installed on, or incorporated into, the aircraft (or other 
Equipment) or (Z) where such Pans and Equipment were purchased specifically for attachment on, 
installation in, or incorporation into, the aircraft and which Aircraft constitutes part of the Inventory (as 
defined in Floor Plan); (ii) All leases, accounts, contracts rights, chattel paper and rental instruments with 
respect to the Aircraft, now owned or hereafter existing in favor of, or acquired by, Borrower as to which 
the granting of a lien does not violate any agreement between Borrower and any parent, subsidiary, or 
Affiliate of Lender (other than Borrower) (collectively, all of the foregoing in which a lien is granted, the 
"Contracts"); (iii) All reserves or credits, however created, and any other property of, or belonging to, 
Borrower now or hereafter in the possession or control of Lender and all of Borrower's rights to any 
rebates, discounts, prepayments, credits, factory holdbacks and incentive payments which may become 
due to Borrower by any supplier, distributor or manufacturer of the Aircraft with respect to the Aircraft or 
any part thereof (collectively, "Credits"); (iv) and all cash, rents and non-cash proceeds of the above 
described Aircraft, Contracts or Credits, including but not limited to insurance payable by reason of loss 
or damage to any of the Aircraft. The security interest in the above-described Collateral is a purchase 
money security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code. The proceeds of the Extension of Credit 
will be used for a "Proper Purpose" as defined in Section 2 of the Floor Plan. 
4. 
Power of Attorney: Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to file any and all financing statements 
necessary to perfect Lender's security interest in the Collateral. Borrower hereby appoints Lender as 
Borrower's Attorney-in-Fact to sign in Borrower's name and on Borrower's behalf all FAA bills of sale 
and registration documents and any and all other papers and documents necessary or appropriate to assist 
Lender in establishing and maintaining a valid security interest in the Collateral to the extent consistent 
with this Agreement and the Floor Plan, and to assure that the aircraft described above is titled, registered 
and the security interest perfected to Lender's reasonable satisfaction, and to do all other things and take 
all other actions reasonably necessary to give effect to such security interest. Borrower agrees to take all 
actions reasonably necessary to give effect to such security interest and to perfect it. 
5. 
Remedies and Default: This Agreement is governed by the terms of the Floor Plan, including 
without limitation its remedial provisions and provisions relating to and describing Events of Default, and 
the terms and provisions of the Floor Plan are incorporated herein as if fully set forth herein. 
6. 
Confirmation. The parties agree and acknowledge that although this Agreement differs (to 
account for multiple aircraft) from the form security agreement attached to the Floor Plan, it constitutes 
one of the Security Agreements contemplated under the Floor Plan and that it secures the Notes (as 
defined therein) and the Obligations (as defined therein). This Agreement is supplemental to and 
incorporates the terms of the Floor Plan, and is a Supplemental Aircraft Inventory Security Agreement as 
contemplated under the Floor Plan. 
7. 
Counterpart: Terms. 
This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in separate 
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts 
shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein 
shall have the meaning set forth in the Floor Plan.
