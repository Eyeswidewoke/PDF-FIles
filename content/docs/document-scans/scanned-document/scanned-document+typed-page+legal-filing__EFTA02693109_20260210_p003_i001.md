rhythms, to move a cursor to acquire targets (Wolpaw 
and McFarland 2004). 
These types of studies based on 
sensorimotor rhythms require weeks to months of training 
before satisfactory levels of performance are attained. Relative 
to EEG signals, the increased signal-to-noise ratio and 
bandwidth of invasively acquired neural data are commonly 
thought to be factors that reduce the training time required by 
users of invasive BCI systems (Schalk a al 2(08). In addition. 
studies of tetraplegic humans with implanted microelectrode 
arrays have exclusively demonstrated 213 control of a cursor 
through imagined natural movement (Hochberg et al 2006. 
Kim et al 2008). This decoding of imagined natural movement 
is also a likely factor in reduced training time since neural 
signals directly correlate with intended actions. 
However, recently several off-line decoding studies 
have demonstrated the reconstruction of cursor and 
hand kinematics from noninvasive magnetoencephalography 
(MEG) (Bradbeny et al 2009) and EEG (Bradberry et al 2010). 
The noise and bandwidth limitations of the noninvasively 
acquired signals did not impede decoding kinematics of 
natural movement. This finding implies that a noninvasive 
BCI system based on the decoding method reported in those 
studies may require little training time. 
In this study, we sought to investigate the use of the 
decoding method reported in those off-line studies in an EEG-
based BCI system during a single session lasting less than 
2 h that required only brief training. We hypothesized that the 
putative human mirror neuron system (MNS), which predicts 
and interprets one's own actions and the actions of others 
(Tkach et al 2008), could be exploited during training by 
asking subjects to combine motor imagery with observation 
of a video of cursor movement. 
In fact., several of the 
aforementioned invasive studies (Hochberg a al 2006, Kim 
et al 2(08) successfully demonstrated a similar approach 
to training. We further hypothesized that a neural decoder 
could subsequently be built off-line that would predict cursor 
movement from neural activity, and the decoder could then be
used on-line for real-time brain-control of cursor movement 
with little training time. Furthermore, to provide additional 
validation of our hypotheses, we sought to examine the 
involvement of neural regions in encoding cursor velocity 
during observation of the cursor movement and during tasks 
requiring a brain-controlled cursor to acquire targets in 213 
space. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Experimental tasks 
The Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland 
at College Park approved the experimental procedure. After 
giving informed consent, five healthy. right-handed, male 
subjects performed a three-phase task: calibration, practice 
and target acquisition. None of the subjects had previously 
participated in a BO study. In all phases. their EEG signals 
were acquired while they sat upright in a chair with hands 
resting in their laps at arm's length away from a computer 
monitor that displayed a workspace of dimensions 30 cm x 
2 
Figure 1. Setup of EEG-based BCI experiment. Subjects EEG 
signals were acquired while sitting in a chair facing a monitor that 
displayed a cursor and targets (only target acquisition phase). 
During the calibration phase, subjects observed a computer-
controlled cursor to collect data for subsequent initialization of the 
decoder. In the target acquisition phase (shown in the photo). 
subjects moved the brain-controlled cursor to acquire targets that 
appeared at the left, top, right, or bottom of the computer screen.

30 cm and a cursor of diameter 1.5 cm (0.20% of workspace) 
(figure O. Subjects were instructed to remain still and relax 
their muscles to reduce the introduction of artifacts into the 
EEG recordings. 
2.1.1. 
Calibration phase. 
During the calibration phase, 
subjects were instructed to imagine moving their right 
arm/finger to track a computer-controlled cursor that moved 
in two dimensions on the computer screen. The movements of 
the computer-controlled cursor were generated by replaying 
a 10 min recording of a pilot subject's brain-controlled 
cursor movements from one of his practice runs (this pilot 
subject did not participate as one of the five subjects in 
this study). 
Histograms of the horizontal and vertical 
positions and velocities of the computer-controlled movements 
indicated approximately uniform coverage of the workspace 
and biological motion respectively (figure 2). The decoding 
procedure described in section 2.3 below was subsequently 
executed (^-10 min of computation time) to calibrate the 
decoder so that it best mapped the EEG signals to observed 
horizontal and vertical cursor velocities. During pilot testing, 
we discovered that asking subjects to visually fixate the center 
of the workspace while simultaneously tracking the cursor 
added attentional demands that burdened the subjects and 
likely compromised the decoding; therefore, we told subjects 
they were free to move their eyes but to always maintain eye 
contact and spatial attention with the moving cursor. 
2.1.2. 
Practice phase. 
During the practice phase. the 
subjects used the calibrated decoder to attempt to move 
the cursor with their thoughts in two dimensions as desired
