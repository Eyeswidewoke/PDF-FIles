General Economic and Market Conditions and Issuer Risk. Any investment in securities carries 
certain market risks. In addition to the factors discussed in the applicable Fund's PPM, 
investments by a Fund may decline in value for any number of reasons over which the Fund 
may have no control, including changes in the overall market for equity or equity-like securities 
and other general economic and market conditions, such as interest rates, availability of credit, 
inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws, currency exchange rates and controls 
and national and international political circumstances (including wars and security operations). 
The value of a Fund may also decline as a result of factors pertaining to particular portfolio 
securities held by such Fund, such as perception or changes in the issuer's management, the 
market for the issuer's products or services, sources of supply. technological changes within 
the issuer's industry, the availability of additional capital and labor, general economic 
conditions, political conditions, and other similar conditions. All of these factors may affect the 
level and volatility of security prices and the liquidity and the value of the securities held by a 
Fund. Unexpected volatility or illiquidity could impair a Fund's profitability or result in it

increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry. 
Investments in Non-U.S. Issuers. Certain Funds invest in equity and equity related securities of 
foreign issuers, depository receipts and other securities or instruments that represent an 
indirect interest in securities of foreign issuers, collective vehicles that invest in foreign 
securities and other securities, derivatives or instruments whose performance is linked to the 
performance of foreign securities or baskets of foreign securities. Investments in foreign 
securities are affected by risk factors generally not thought to be present in the United States. 
These risks may be increased to the extent that a Fund invests in issuers in emerging markets. 
Such factors include, but are not limited to. the following: varying custody, brokerage and 
settlement practices; difficulty in valuation and pricing; less public information about issuers of 
foreign securities; less governmental regulation and supervision over the issuance and trading 
of securities; the unavailability of financial information regarding the foreign issuer or the 
difficulty of interpreting financial information prepared under foreign accounting standards; less 
liquidity and more volatility in foreign security markets; the possibility of expropriation or 
nationalization; the imposition of withholding and other taxes: adverse political, social or 
diplomatic developments: limitations on the movement of funds or other assets of a Fund 
between different countries; difficulties in invoking the legal process outside of the U.S. and

be renegotiated. Investment in foreign countries also involves higher brokerage and custodian
