Choose Which 
Which Charges to Pay Now and Which to Pay Later 
Did you know your Card has a special feature that allows you to 
choose just about any purchase from your statement to pay for over 
time? There's no enrollment required and with the flexibility to extend 
payment on charges of your choice, you can take advantage of 
unexpected opportunities--while you're on vacation, shopping or 
enjoying a big night out. And best of all, whether you pay in full or 
select charges to pay over time, you'll enjoy the benefits and security 
your Card provides. 
Not all Cardmembers are eligible. Requests to pay over time are approved based on 
several factors including account history, current account status and credit record at time of 
request. 
To choose virtually any 
charges to pay over 
time, go to 
www.americanexpress. 
com/selectandpay, 
select the ''Get Started" 
button, log on and dick on 
charges you want to take 
more time to pay. Or call 
the number on the back of 
your Card and press 0.
