Even If your Account is not enroled in a Feature, you may request to transfer the payarnfull balance, or a portion thereof, to a Feature, and 
extend payment of those amounts over time. We may approve or decline your transfer request in whole or in part at our sole discretion. 
Any portion of the parinfull balance not authorized by us for transfer to a Feature must be paid in full upon your receipt of your biting 
statement.' 
We are replacing the entire Billing Statements section of the Agreement with the following new section entitled Billing Statements/Amount Duo: 
*Billing Statements/Amount Due 
You must notify us immediately of any change in the mailing or email address to which we send biting statements or notices that a biting 
statement has been posted Milling Address'). If you wish a Billing Address charge to apply to more than one account you maintain with 
us, you must tell us. You agree that we may also update your Billing Address if we receive information that your Billing Address has 
changed or is incorrect. We apply those terms of this Agreement that vary by state according to your Billing Address. When we receive 
information that you have changed your Billing Address, those terms of this Agreement that vary depending on the state of your Billing 
Address will apply to the entire balance of your Account, including existing balances. 
Each billing statement will reflect a New Balance and, if your balance includes Charges incurred on any Feature, a Minimum Amount Due. 
The "Amount Due' is the total of (i) all Charges on your Account other than those associated with Features, plus (ii) the Minimum Amount 
Due (described below) for any Charges associated with Features, plus (iii) any portion of any previously baled Amount Due that remains 
unpaid. The Amount Duo is duo and payable once you receive the billing statement. You may pay more than the Amount Due, up to the 
total balance on your Account, at any time. 
The Amount Due for any Charges associated with Features will be the greatest of: 
• 
1/50th of the New Balance of all Features on the Closing Date of the billing statement (the calor/Laden of which is rounded to the 
nearest whole dollar), 
• 
the current billed Finance Charges, or 
• 
$20 (or the total outstandng balance of all Features if it is less than $20). 
If the greatest of the three calculations Immediately above Is the current billed Finance Charges, then we will add 815 to the calculation of the 
Minimum Amount Due for Charges associated with the Features' 
We are replacing the last paragraph of the Payments section of your Agreement with the following: 
'Sub/eel to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and 
manner determined by us in our sole discretion. In most cases, we will apply and allocate payments to the Minimum Amount Due on 
Feature balances first, then to amounts due in full. The remainder of your payment will be applied to any outstanding Feature balances. 
Amounts applied to Feature balances veil be applied first to Feature balances at lower Annual Percentage Rates ("APRs") and then to 
higher APR Feature balances. In most cases, we will apply purchase credits first to the balance from which the corresponding debit 
originated. However, for servicing, administrative, systems or other business reasons, we may apply and allocate payments and credits 
among Features and to Charges on your Account in some other order or manner that we may determine in our sole discretion. You agree 
that we have.the unconditional right to exercise this discretion in away that is most favorable or convenient to us."
We are adding a new section entitled Finance Charges on Features to the Agreement, reading In its entirety as follows: 
'Finance Charges on Features 
A. Finance Charges begin to accrue foe each Charge as of the date it is added to the daily balance for a Feature, as described below. 
However, for Charges (other than Finance Charges) that are added to a balance automatically, no Finance Charges will accrue in any billing 
period in which the total Account balance on the Closing Date for the previous billing period is zero or a credit balance. In addition, Finance 
Charges will not accrue during a biding period on any Feature balance if, by the Closing Date of that billing period, payment In full of the New 
Balance shown on the statement for the previous billing period is credited to your Account; provided, however, that Finance Charges will 
accrue on transactions added at your request to a Feature balance during the billing period. 
B. Each Feature is subject to the same Daily Periodic Rate ("DPR"), unless we notify you otherwise. Except as provided below, the DPR 
for each Feature is based on an APR, which may vary. The APR is the Prime Rate (described below) plus 9.99%. A DPR is 1/365th of the 
APR. Your DPRs and APRs appear on the accompanying supplement(s). When an APR changes, we apply it to any existing balance 
subject to that rate. 
C. The "Prime Rate' is determined once with respect to each billing period. The Prime Rate for each billing period is the Prime Rate 
published in the Money Rates section (or successor section) of The Wall Street Journal on (a) the first day of that billing period or (b) the day 
that is two days prior to the Closing Date of that billing period, whichever is higher. In each case, if such day is not a customary publication 
day for The Wall Street Journal, we wiil substitute the closest preceding day that is a customary publication day. If The Wall Street Journal 
ceases or suspends publication, we may refer to the Prime Rale published in any other newspaper of general circulation in New York, New 
York, or we may substitute a similar reference rate at our sole discretion. Any increase or decrease to an APR resulting from a change in 
the Prime Rate takes effect as of the first day of the billing period. An increase in the Prime Rate means that the variable APRs (and 
corresponding DPRs) applicable to your Account will increase and you may Incur higher Finance Charges and may have a higher Minimum 
Amount Duo. 
D. The DPR (and corresponding APR) on all Features may increase to the Default Rate If during the Review Period (i) your Account is 
delinquent on the Closing Date of any two consecutive bitting periods; or (i) on two or more occasions a payment submitted on your Account 
is not honored on first presentment. Your Account will be considered delinquent if payment of the Amount Due from a billing period is not 
credited to your Account by the Closing Date of the next billing period. The "Review Period" is the period, constituting approximately one 
year, of twelve consecutive billing periods ending with the Closing Date of the current billing period, whether or not you received a statement 
for each such billing period. If the Default Rate is applied, It will apply to your Account for twelve consecutive biting periods, beginning with 
the current billing period. The Default Rate will not apply to any balance for Features unless it is higher than the rate that would otherwise 
apply to that balance. The Default Rate is a DPR which corresponds to an APR equal to the Prime Rate plus 21.99%." 
We are adding a new section entitled Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges to the Agreement. reading in its 
entirety as follows:
