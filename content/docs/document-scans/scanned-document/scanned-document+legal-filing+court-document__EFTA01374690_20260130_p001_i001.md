is the Equity Amount Payer, the Dividend Amount shall be 
determined by the Calculation Agent with respect to the 
Shares. The Calculation Agent shall notify Party B of such 
determination at least three (3) Scheduled Trading Days prior 
to the last date the election may be made. 
In the event that the Calculation Agent reasonably 
determines that there has been any Change in Tax Law (as 
defined in the Agreement) which would have the effect of 
reducing or increasing the amount of either the cash 
receivable or tax credit attributable to the Dividend Amount 
that would be paid by an Issuer to a holder of such Shares 
that had either (i) a tax residence in the UK, Germany, or in 
the jurisdiction of any Lender (where the Transaction is 
entered into by Party A through its office located in the UK); 
or (ii) a taxable presence in the U.S. or a tax residence in 
Germany or in the jurisdiction of any Lender (where the 
Transaction is entered into by Party A through an affiliate as 
its agent in the U.S.) (a "Dividend Disruption Event"), the 
Calculation Agent may adjust the Dividend Amount with 
immediate effect by notice in writing to the parties, or, in the 
event that any such change is expressed to take effect prior 
to the date upon which Calculation Agent gives such notice, 
the Calculation Agent may make such adjustments to the 
payment obligations of the parties in respect of the 
Transaction, as it deems appropriate. In the event that the 
Transaction shall have been previously closed (including by 
reason of a Change in Law Additional Disruption Event), but 
the amount of any payment previously made or subsequently 
to be made thereunder is affected by such Change in Tax 
Law, the relevant party shall indemnify the other in respect of 
any such change on a full indemnity basis. "Lender means 
any third party entity resident for tax purposes in the 
jurisdiction of the Issuer of the Shares who may be engaged 
in securities lending transactions with Party A in connection 
with the Transaction involving securities identical or 
equivalent to (or involving securities of the same issuer in 
respect of) the Shares. 
Calculation Agent Adjustment 
As determined by the Calculation Agent, (x) any cash 
dividend or distribution declared on the Shares at a time when 
the Issuer has not previously declared or paid dividends or 
distributions on such Shares for the prior four quarterly 
periods; or (y) any increase in the dividends or distributions 
paid on the Shares; or (z) any other "special" cash or non-
cash dividend on, or distribution with respect to, the Shares 
which is, by its terms or declared intent, declared and paid 
outside the normal operations or normal dividend procedures 
of the Issuer; provided that, in all cases, the related Record 
Date occurs during the Dividend Period. 
For the avoidance of doubt, the Calculation Agent shall make 
the relevant adjustment to this Transaction in respect of any 
Extraordinary Dividend in accordance with Section 11.2(c)(C) 
of the Equity Definitions. 
Party A and Party B each acknowledges that, if during the 
term of this Transaction, 0) the Shares hereunder are, or

agree that, as a consequence of the Tender Offer, the
