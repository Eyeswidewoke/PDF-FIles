Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings. 
Commencement of foreclosure or 
forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or 
any other method, by any creditor of Grantor or by any governmental agency 
against any collateral securing the loan. This includes a garnishment of any of 
Grantor's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event 
of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Grantor as to the 
validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or 
forfeiture proceeding and if Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or 
forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the 
creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its 
reasonable discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute. 
34.7 
Events Affecting Guarantor. If a Guarantor(s) exists: Any of the preceding 
events occurs with respect to any Guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation 
party of any of the Indebtedness or any Guarantor, endorser, surety, or 
accommodation party dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the 
validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness. 
30.8 
Change in Ownership or Management. If the Grantor is an entity (including 
without limitation, a partnership, a limited partnership, a limited liability 
company, or a corporation), any change in ownership or control of twenty-five 
percent (25%) or more of the equity interests of Grantor or any change in the 
management of Grantor, whether voluntary or involuntary or resulting from the 
death of an owner or manager of the Grantor. 
35. 
RIGHT TO CURE. If any Event of Default, other than a default on 
Indebtedness, is curable and if Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, has not been given a 
notice of a similar Event of Default within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if 
Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, after Lender sends written notice to Borrower or 
Grantor, as the case may be, demanding cure of such Event of Default: (I) cure the Event of 
Default within fifteen (IS) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than fifteen (IS) days, 
immediately initiate steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient to cure 
the Event of Default and thereafter continue and complete all reasonable and necessary steps 
sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical. 
36. 
RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT. If an Event of Default occurs 
under this Agreement, at any time thereafter, Lender shall have all the rights of a secured party 
under the Uniform Commercial Code and a creditor under the Convention, and Lender shall have 
and may exercise any or all other rights and remedies it may have available at law, in equity, or 
otherwise. In addition and without limitation, Lender may exercise any one or more of the 
following rights and remedies: 
36.1 
Accelerate Indebtedness. Lender may declare the entire Indebtedness, including 
any prepayment premium which Grantor would be required to pay, immediately 
due and payable, without notice of any kind to Grantor.
