CRS-4 
Immigration Act of 1990 
By 1986, the number of aliens receiving asylum annually was growing, and a 
backlog in obtaining LPR status developed due to the 5,000 ceiling. Compounding 
the frustration with the backlog was the worry of many of those asylees from Eastern 
Europe that — as a result of the improved political and human rights conditions in 
their native countries — they no longer would qualify as refugees under the law. 
Meanwhile, the number of aliens filing asylum claims surpassed 100,000 in 1989. 
The Immigration Act of 1990 sought, among other major immigration reforms, 
to address the backlogs in asylee adjustments to LPR status. Foremost, it doubled the 
annual limit from 5,000 to 10,000 LPR adjustments. It also allowed those asylees 
who had filed for LPR adjustments before June 1, 1990, to do so outside of the 
numerical limits, effectively clearing out the existing backlog. The Immigration Act 
of 1990 further granted LPR status to those asylees who had qualified for LPR status 
as of November 29, 1990, but were unable to obtain it because of the prior numerical 
limits and improved country conditions. The crumbling of communism in Eastern 
Europe and the Arias Peace talks in Central America gave optimism to many that the 
number of asylum seekers would lessen in the future." 
1996 Revisions to Asylum Policy 
Prior to 1996, aliens arriving at a port of entry to the United States without 
proper immigration documents were eligible for a hearing before an immigration 
judge to determine whether the aliens were admissible. Aliens lacking proper 
documents could request asylum in the United States at that time. If the alien 
received an unfavorable decision from the immigration judge, he or she also could 
seek administrative and judicial review of the case. 
Critics of this policy argued that illegal aliens were arriving without proper 
documents, filing frivolous asylum claims, and obtaining work authorizations while 
their asylum cases stalled in lengthy backlogs. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the 
mass exodus of thousands of asylum seekers from Central America, Cuba, and Haiti 
prompted further concerns that the then-current policy was unwieldy and prone to 
abuses because it provided for multiple levels of hearings, reviews, and appeals. The 
1993 bombing of the World Trade Center heightened fears that international 
terrorists might enter the United States with false documents, file bogus asylum 
claims, and disappear into the population. 
Supporters of thc then-current system asserted that the regulatory reforms begun 
by the first Bush Administration and expanded by the Clinton Administration had 
already corrected the bureaucratic problems that had plagued the asylum process. 
They emphasized that the United States was a signatory to the UN Refugee Protocol 
and that INA codified the internationally-held legal principle of nonrefoulement (i.e., 
that an alien would not be forced to return to a country where his life or freedom 
" In Feb. 1987, the Presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala signed a I 0-point 
peace plan for Central America that was first offered by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. 
Nicaragua joined the peace process later that same year.
