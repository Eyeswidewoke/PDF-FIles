case may be, it wishes to receive Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin 
Securities in such form as will arise if the right is exercised or, in the 
case of a right which may be exercised in more than one manner, is exercised 
as is specified in such written notice; provided that if any sum is required 
to be paid by a holder of the securities to the issuer or any other person 
in order to exercise such rights, the other party shall pay to the first 
party an amount equal to such sum. 
(b) 
Where any voting rights fall to be exercised in relation to any 
Purchased Securities or Margin Securities which are equities and in respect 
of which Equivalent Securities or, as the case may be, Equivalent Margin 
Securities have not been transferred, neither Buyer, in the case of 
Purchased Securities, nor the transferee, in the case of Margin Securities, 
shall have any obligation to arrange for voting rights of that kind to be 
exercised in accordance with the instructions of the other party in relation 
to such Purchased Securities or Margin Securities, unless otherwise agreed 
between the parties.

Transfer 
(a) 
Seller shall promptly pay and account for any transfer or similar 
duties or taxes chargeable in connection with the transfer of Purchased 
Securities which are equities and any Equivalent Securities in respect 
thereof and shall reimburse to Buyer the amount of any liability incurred by 
it as a result of Seller's failure to do so. 
(b) 
Where Margin Securities which are equities are transferred by one 
party to the other, the transferor (the first party) shall promptly pay and 
account for any transfer or similar duties or taxes chargeable in connection 
with such transfer as well as in connection with any subsequent transfer by 
the transferee (the second party) of Equivalent Margin Securities in respect 
thereof to the first party and shall reimburse to the second party the 
amount of any liability incurred by the second party as a result of the 
first party's failure to do so. 
(c) 
In relation to Transactions to which this Annex applies and unless 
otherwise agreed, where any Purchased Securities, Equivalent Securities, 
Margin Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities are transferred through a 
settlement system which automatically generates a mandatory payment or 
delivery, or a mandatory obligation to pay or deliver, against the transfer 
of such Securities, then eM 
(i) 
such automatically generated payment, delivery or obligation shall 
be treated as a payment or delivery by the transferee to the transferor, and 
except to the extent that it is applied to discharge an obligation of the 
transferee to effect a payment or delivery, such payment or delivery, or 
obligation to pay or deliver, shall be deemed to be a Margin Transfer made 
by the transferee; and 
(ii) 
unless the parties shall have agreed otherwise, the party receiving 
such Margin Transfer shall cause to be made to the other party for value the 
same day either, where such Margin Transfer is a payment, an irrevocable 
payment in the amount of such Margin Transfer or, where such Margin Transfer 
is a delivery, an irrevocable delivery of Securities (or other property, as 
the case may be) equivalent thereto.
