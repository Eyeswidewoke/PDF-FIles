Defense in Paris, the Henri Matisse Park in Lille, gardens of the Chateau de Blois and 
the Mediterranean Gardens (Le Jardin des Mediterranees) of the Domaine du Rayol. His 
most influential work internationally has perhaps been his part of the Parc Andre-
Citroen. It includes a Moving Garden managed by the park staff: It is they who decide 
where the paths will be mown from year to year, to respect self-sown plants. Nearby, his 
color-themed gardens have a complex symbolism, which visitors might sense even if 
uninformed. Mothers report that when they enter the Green Garden, linked to the 
theme of silence, their children often stop talking. 
In 1997, Piet Oudolf, I-Ienk Gerritsen and Michael King commented on these gardens 
(in Nienwe Women, nieume tuthen): "Gilles Clement's triumph at Parc Andre-Citroen 
demonstrates the range of possibilities the art of gardening offers for both self-
expression and communication. He has shown how ideas may be presented both on the 
grand scale and in the tiniest detail, making his approach as relevant to the private 
gardener as it should be to the broader world of the landscape architect." 
Clement refuses the romantic idea of an artist's signature, but his public projects have 
common elements: He often links separate spaces - 
formally, as at Citroen or 
informally, like clearings in a forest — each with its own character. Connecting paths are 
meandering and multidirectional. Where he includes a single long axis (at Le Grande 
Arche de la Defense in the Domaine du Rayon, it never dominates in the sense of 
imposing a hierarchy and reveals little of the mysteries on either side, easily accessed 
from the long line but invisible until you happen right upon it. He sometimes uses 
geometric shapes, especially around historic monuments or where symbolism is 
suggested, but this formality is open-ended, almost subversive in its unpredictability. His 
rejection of hierarchy, in garden design as in life, is almost obsessive. For several years 
running, Clement refused the French national prize for landscape architecture, insisting 
it should be given to the anonymous farmers, engineers and foresters who are the real 
architects of the landscape. In 1999, the prize was bestowed on him without his consent. 
Clement calls the Moving Garden a conceptual tool. His second one, the Planetary 
Garden, emerged after he had seen the first photographs of Earth from space. He 
imagined extending the confines — and care — lavished on home gardens to the whole 
globe. In 2000, Clement directed a major science exhibit in Paris to explain and provide 
positive examples of this theme. He also took a stance on species migrations similar to 
that of American writer Michael Pollan, which has not always made him popular in the 
scientific community. "The main objective," writes Clement, "is to encourage biological 
diversity, a source of wonder and our guarantee for the future." 
For the past few years, Clement has been developing another concept, which he calls 
"landscapes of the Third Kind." A study of highly managed farm and forest land south 
of Paris led him to seek out hidden spaces that escape monoculture and are forgotten by 
human industry, in-between spaces often abandoned after misuse, still capable of
