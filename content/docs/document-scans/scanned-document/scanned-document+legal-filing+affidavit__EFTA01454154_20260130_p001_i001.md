On May 9, the State Council of China issued the "Guiding Principles for the Healthy Development of 
Capital Markets", which layouts the detailed roadmaps of China's future capital market development 
in nine major areas, including overall requirements, stock market, bond market, private equity, futures 
market, the competitiveness of the securities and futures sector, capital market openness, financial 
risks and market regulation. The policy is also referred as the "New National Nine Rules", in contrast 
to the earlier "National Nine Rules" issued in 2004. Under the nine broad guidelines, details on the 
directions and goals of reforms for thirty-three areas are specified, signaling the unprecedented 
resolution of Chinese government to push forward the comprehensive capital market reforms. It is 
government's aim to establish multi-layer capital markets, enlarge corporate and household 
investment channel, encourage efficient capital allocation as well as promote the economic 
restructuring. From macroeconomic perspective, we highlight the below reforms: 
Further opening up China's capital markets 
Following the recent announcement of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect Scheme on Apr 10, the 
Guideline again emphasizes on opening up the capital markets, with an aim to facilitate the cross-
border investment and financing activities. Both inward and outward investment quotas under QFII 
and QDII programs will be increased. The shareholding limits for foreign capital in listcos will be 
relaxed. Domestic capital market will be steadily opened up for the direct investment of foreign 
individuals, and the domestic individuals investing in foreign capital market will be orderly pushed 
forward. Moreover, Xiao Gang, chairman of CSRC said this March that the potential QFII expansion 
is huge, and he mentioned that CSRC has been working on the QFII tax policy with other government 
agencies, as part of the effort to help facilitate QFII expansion this year. 
We believed that this proposal will help inject more liquidity into China A share market, as well as 
expedite China's progresses in capital account liberalization in a boarder sense, including a) further 
relaxing the foreign investment management like holding period and remittance; b) implementing and 
expanding the Stock Connect scheme (see our Apr 11 note "A leap in China's efforts to liberalize 
capital accounts"); c) establishing capital account convertibility in SHFTZ and developing a domestic 
RMB offshore market; d) permitting cross-border RMB remittances by individuals and broadening 
channels for offshore banks to borrow/lend RMB in domestic market. 
Promoting direct-financing 
To develop a multi-layer capital market with proper structure, complete function and effective 
regulation by 2020, the Guideline highlighted the development of direct financing, which includes 
three major areas of bond market, equity market and private equity. 
On bond market, the Guideline aimed to a) develop a scheme of local government bond 
issuance; 2) enrich bond products suitable for various investors; 3) develop bond types for SMEs; 4) 
connect different bond exchanges and 5) improve issuance procedure, rating mechanism as well as 
6) promote asset securitization. To develop a multi-layered equity market and cultivate a healthy 
private equity market are other two major areas in promoting the direct-financing. 
In A share stock market, the approval-based stock issuance system will be replaced by 
a registration-based one, and such move will be accompanied by the new IPOs governing rules 
published by the Securities Association of China the same day of the Guideline. Regulators will 
crackdown insider trading, enhance information disclosure, improve delisting regime, and support 
pension funds investments into capital markets by preferential tax policies. 
• 
The State Council also said it will foster the market for private equity funds and venture 
capital funds. Going forward, the placement of private equity won't be subjected to administrative 
approval and funds of private equity and venture capital will be encouraged to support SMEs and 
newly-emerging industries. 
We believe that such reforms will substantially help to improve financial stability and capital allocation
