Leon, l>=A0 Congragulations on biting=the bullet. at least 18 months late , but I m enco=raged and glad for you. 
When you interviewed Brad two years ag= you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before him. 4>=A0 what 
would you like me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE =mount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact=C240 same work that i 
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now comp=icated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if yourlike ) . 
Brad wechsler was never=up to the task . sorry, I realize I have been saying the=very same thing for a long time. he 
was a not a step up from Eileen =ut a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eil=en and Tom and Ralph Lerner. all 
your hand picks. =hen brad. john, Joe. . joslin<=span> was chosen from a pool of 2 people. each that world be 
limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp i= order to get him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the 
bookke=ping and <=pan id="m_-2434106449994715214:27s.4">joslin tax, =He complained for over a year, re his 
direction by eileeng=pan> and ada , and then b=ad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths 
of=warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year= with john and joe. He ran amok, =nd as i told you he 
rarely failed to remind me in our conversa=ions that you told him that he works for you and not for me an= that brad 
needs to pays him . 
.=C240 Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for yearst)=A0 over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns<=span> name, . no follow up 
questions no in=eractions , not even one single question asked of me re her work.40=A0 ( that was Eileen _) but 
somehow car=yns fuck up was my doing. . =C240 when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the tas=, you 
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth.Q=A0 . You told me this year , that by trying to pro=ect you 
from crazy joslin, I h=d in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work.=C2. it then turns out that he 
didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less=money. 
and continued to make a really dangerous=C2* 
mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes , was also my=doing , though email after email said , I take no responsibility for 
him,and jan you told me he was gone. however he too is stil= there, and a waste of money and space. 
+=AO 
My time is complicated =y Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use=C2* the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had put together.=C24, . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make=re my 
time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for=a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and make any 
future plan= to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination pro=uced mess. 
That being said , =C24) the tasks at hand are the following. 
You have a bomb =f colored string that your retarded children have formed , It=has to be very carefully unwound , 
even the substitution=of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s=C2* It would be much 
preferable if Wechsler<=span> was not his replacement. do you have any p=rson you trust ??! . I am concerned re brad 
taking b=rrys place re <=pan class="" style="" id=":2be.19" tabindex="-1">XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to 
find and le=rn ACCURATE . org charts. books, balance sheets. tru=t valuations. are all a part. Barry will need 2 
months t= just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed m=difications., 
a way overdue re- fresh of your estat= plan . 
clats40=A0 , trust. partnerships. grats<=span>. Ilcs. bank account= ,
