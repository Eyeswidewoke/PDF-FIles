Re: The EDGE Annual Question 2012 - Invitation to participate 
In the summer of 2009, in a talk at the Bristol (UK) Festival of Ideas, =reeman Dyson articulated a vision for the future. 
He referenced "The =ge Of Wonder", by Richard Holmes, in which the first Romantic Age =escribed by Holmes was 
centered on chemistry and poetry, while Dyson =ointed out that this new age is dominated by computational biology. Its 
=eaders, he noted, include "biology wizards" Kary Mullis, Craig Venter, =edical engineer Dean Kamen; and "computer 
wizards" Larry Page and =ergey Brin, and Charles Simonyi. He pointed out that the nexus for this =ntellectual activity —
the Lunar Society for the 21st century — is =entered around the activities of EDGE. 
Dyson continued to articulate his vision for a new age of biology in a =elated review inNew York Review of Books in 
which he wrote: "...a new =eneration of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron =rote verses, might 
create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and =rees and birds to enrich the ecology of our planet. Most of these 
=rtists would be amateurs, but they would be in close touch with =cience, like the poets of the earlier Age of Wonder. 
The new Age of =onder might bring together wealthy entrepreneurs like Venter and Kamen =.. and a worldwide 
community of gardeners and farmers and breeders, =orking together to make the planet beautiful as well as fertile, 
=ospitable to hummingbirds as well as to humans." 
So, along these lines, who can best articulate the important issues =uestions we face today than the very people who 
are, through their =deas and entrepreneurial zeal, changing the very nature of reality =tself. Here's the 2012 Annual 
Question. Before sending it out widely to =he list, it's useful to seed the project with a dozen or so interesting =esponses 
to provide examples and set a high bar. Even better, to =nspire. How about it?? Hope to hear from you. JB
