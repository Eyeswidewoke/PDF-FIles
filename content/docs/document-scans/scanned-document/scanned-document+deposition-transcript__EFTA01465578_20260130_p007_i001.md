Selected Purchase Considerations 
• APPRECIATION POTENTIAL — The Notes provide the opportunity to receive a 5% 
return at maturity if the Reference Currency Return is greater 
than 0%, and a 28.50% return at maturity if the Reference Currency Return is 
greater than 3%. Because the Notes are our senior unsecured debt 
obligations, payment of any amount at maturity is subject to our ability to 
pay our obligations as they become due. 
• LOSS OF PRINCIPAL IF THE REFERENCE CURRENCY RETURN IS LESS THAN THE 
BARRIER LEVEL - if the Reference Currency 
Return is greater than or equal to the Barrier Level of -15%, you will 
receive at least the Principal Amount at maturity, even if the Reference 
Currency 
has depreciated against the U.S Dollar as compared to the Initial Spot 
Rate. If the Reference Currency Return is less than the Barrier Level, you 
will 
lose 1% of your Principal Amount for every 1% that the Reference Currency 
has depreciated against the U.S. Dollar as compared to the Initial Spot 
Rate. If the Reference Currency Return is -100%, you will lose your entire 
investment. 
• EXPOSURE TO THE BRAZILIAN REAL VERSUS THE U.S. DOLLAR — The return on the 
Notes is linked to the performance of the 
Brazilian Real, which we refer to as the Reference Currency, relative to the 
U.S. Dollar, and will enable you to participate in any appreciation of the 
Reference Currency relative to the U.S. Dollar from the Pricing Date to the 
Final Valuation Date. 
• TAX TREATMENT — There is no direct legal authority as to the proper tax 
treatment of the Notes, and therefore significant aspects of the tax 
treatment of the Notes are uncertain as to both the timing and character of 
any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. Under one approach, a Note 
should be treated as a pre-paid executory contract with respect to the 
Reference Currency. We intend to treat the Notes consistent with this 
approach. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, you agree to treat the Notes under this 
approach for all U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the limitations 
described therein, and based on certain factual representations received 
from us, in the opinion of our special U.S. tax counsel, Morrison & Foerster 
LLP, it is reasonable to treat a Note as a pre-paid executory contract with 
respect to the Reference Currency. Assuming this characterization is 
respected, upon a sale or exchange of a Note, you should recognize gain or 
loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or 
exchange and your tax basis in the Note, which should equal the amount you 
paid to acquire the Note. Your gain or loss should generally be exchange 
gain or loss that is taxable as ordinary income or loss for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes, unless an election under Section 988 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") is available and made to treat 
such gain or loss as capital gain or loss ("Section 988 election"). The 
Section 988 election is generally available for a forward contract, a 
futures contract, or option on foreign currencies as described in Section 
988 of the 
Code. Although not clear, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the accompanying
