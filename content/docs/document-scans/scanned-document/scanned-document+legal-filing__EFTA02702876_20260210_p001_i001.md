ABSTRACT 
Workers in insect societies are sometimes observed to kill male eggs of other workers, a phenomenon 
known as worker policing. We perform a mathematical analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of policing. 
We investigate the selective forces behind policing for both dominant and recessive mutations for dif-
ferent numbers of matings of the queen. The traditional, relatedness-based argument suggests that 
policing evolves if the queen mates with more than two males, but does not evolve if the queen mates 
with a single male. We derive precise conditions for the invasion and stability of policing alleles. We And 
that the relatedness-based argument is not robust with respect to small changes in colony efficiency 
caused by policing. We also calculate evolutionarily singular strategies and determine when they are 
evolutionarily stable. We use a population genetics approach that applies to dominant or recessive 
mutations of any effect size.

1. Introduction 
In populations with haplodiploid genetics, unfertilized female 
workers are capable of laying male eggs. Thus, in a haplodiploid 
colony, male eggs can in principle originate from the queen or 
from the workers. Worker policing is a phenomenon where female 
workers kill the male eggs of unmated female workers (Ratnieks. 
1988; Ratnieks and Visscher. 1989; Ratnieks et al., 2006; Gadagkar. 
2001; Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 20064. Worker policing is 
observed in many social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps. 
Yet the precise conditions for the evolution of worker policing are 
still unclear. 
Worker policing (Ratnieks. 1988; Ratnieks et al.. 2006; Gadagkar, 
2001; Wenseleers and Ratnieks. 2006a) and worker sterility (Wilson. 
1971; Hamilton. 1972; Olejarz et al., 2015) are two distinct phe-
nomena that are widespread in the eusocial Hymenoptera. In addi-
tion to worker policing, a subset of workers in a colony may forego 
their own reproductive potential to aid in raising their siblings. Prior 
relatedness-based arguments have suggested that queen monogamy 
is important for the evolution of a non-reproductive worker caste

(Hughes et al.. 2008; Cornwallis et al.. 2010; Queller and Strassmann. 
1998; Foster et al.. 2006; Rootnsma, 2007, 2009). In contrast, it is 
believed that polygamy—not monogamy—is important for the evo-
lution of police workers. 
Several papers have studied the evolution of policing. Starr 
(1984) explores various topics in the reproductive biology and 
sociobiology of eusocial Hymenoptera. He defines promiscuity as 
1 firl_ ill ). where n is the number of matings of each queen, and 
J; is the fractional contribution to daughters by the i-th male mate. 
He writes, regarding workers, that "They are on average less 
related to nephews than brothers whenever (promiscuity is 
greater than two) and should prefer that the queen lay all the male 
eggs. Workers would therefore be expected to interfere with each 
other's reproduction." Thus, Starr (1984) was the first to suggest 
that workers should raise their nephews (sons of other workers) if 
the queen mates once, but should only raise their brothers (sons of 
the queen) if the queen mates more than twice. Starr (1984) uses a 
relatedness-based argument. but he does not provide any calcu-
lation of evolutionary dynamics in support of his argument; he 
uses neither population genetics nor inclusive fitness theory. In a 
book on honeybee ecology, Seeley (1985) also proposed, using a 
relatedness-based argument, that worker policing should occur in 
colonies with multiply mated queens, but that worker policing 
should be absent if queens are singly mated.
