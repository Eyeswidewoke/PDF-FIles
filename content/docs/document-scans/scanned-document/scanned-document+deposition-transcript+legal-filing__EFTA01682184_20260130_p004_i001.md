Leslie Wexner, founder of The Limited retail chain and a former Palm Beecher who is said to have been a mentor to 
Epstein. 
Wexner sold Epstein one of his most lavish residences: a massive townhouse that dominates a block on Manhattan's 
Upper East Side. It is reported to have, among its finer features, closed-circuit television and a heated sidewalk to melt 
away fallen snow. 
That townhouse, thought to be the largest private residence in Manhattan, is only a piece of the extravagant world 
Epstein built over time. 
In New Mexico, he constructed a 27,000-square-foot hilltop mansion on a 10,000-acre ranch outside Santa Fe. Many 
believed it to be the largest home in the state. 
In Palm Beach, he bought a waterfront home on El Effillo Way. And he owns a 100-acre private Island in the Virgin 
Islands. 
Perhaps as remarkable as his lavish homes is his extensive network of friends and associates at the highest echelons of 
power. This includes not only socialites but also business tycoons, media moguls, politicians, royalty and Nobel Prize-
winning scientists whose research he often funds. 
"Just like other people collect art, he collects scientists," said Martin Nowak, who directs the Program for Evolutionary 
Dynamics at Harvard University and was reportedly the recipient of a $30 million research donation from Epstein. 
Epstein is said to have befriended former Harvard President Larry Summers, prominent law Professor Alan Dershowitz, 
Donald Trump and New York Daily News Publisher Mort Zuckerman. 
And yet he managed for decades to maintain a low profile. He avoids eating out and was rarely photographed. 
"The odd thing is I never met him," said Dominick Dunne, the famous chronicler of the trials and tribulations of the very 
rich. "I wasn't even aware of him," except for a Vanity Fair article. 
Epstein's friendship with Clinton has attracted the most attention. 
Epstein met Clinton as early as 1995, when he paid tens of thousands of dollars to join him at an intimate fund-raising 
dinner in Palm Beach. But from all appearances, they did not become close friends until after Clinton left the Oval Office 
and moved to New York. 
Epstein has donated more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates' campaigns, including John Kerry's presidential bid, 
the reelection campaign of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and the Senate bids of Joe Lieberman, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, Christopher Dodd and Charles Schumer. 
Powerful friends and enemies 
A Vanity Fair profile found cracks in the veneer of Epstein's life story. The 2003 article said he left Bear Stearns in the 
wake of a federal probe and a possible Securities and Exchange Commission violation. It also pointed out that Citibank 
once sued him for defaulting on a $20 million loan. 
The article suggested that one of his business mentors and previous employers was Steven Hoffenberg, now serving a 
prison term after "bilking investors out of more than $450 million in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history." 
As he amassed his wealth, Epstein made enemies in disputes both large and small. He sued the man who in 1990 sold 
him his multimillion-dollar Palm Beach home over a dispute about less than $16,000 in furnishings. 
A former friend claimed Epstein backed out of a promise to reimburse him hundreds of thousands of dollars after their 
failed investment In Texas oil wells. A judge decided Epstein owed him nothing. 
"Ws a bad memory. I would rather not have ever met Jeffrey Epstein,' said Michael Stroll, the retired former president of 
Williams Electronics and Sega Corp. "Suffice it to say I have nothing good to say about him." 
Among the characteristics most attributed to Epstein is a penchant for women. 
He has been linked to Maxwell, a fixture on the high-society party circuits in both New York and London. Previous 
girlfriends are said to include a former Ms. Sweden and a Romanian model. 
"He's a lot of fun to be with," Donald Trump told New York magazine in 2002. "It is even said that he likes beautiful
