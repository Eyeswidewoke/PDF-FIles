A Tax-Time Aid Now Available Online 
The Year End Summary--a detailed report of all charges billed to your 
account during 2003--provides you with an invaluable aid at tax time. 
And with the improved online version, you will continue to view a 
report of all your charges, but with increased flexibility and 
functionality. The online version enables Platinum Card members to 
sort transactions by date, merchant name, or charge amount. You 
can also view your own charges, just the charges of an Additional 
Card, or all your charges on your account at once. With the easy 
navigation toolbar you can choose from categories such as Travel, 
Restaurant, and Merchandise to get a comprehensive look at the 
charges you've made in a particular category.
