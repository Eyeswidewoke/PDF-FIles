under Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
The DB AG NY Sweep Program is available to individuals, certain nonprofit organizations arid to certain fiduciaries and 
trusts, provided that the beneficiaries are individuals or otherwise eligible. Accounts in the name of business entities 
including corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships are also eligible for the DB AG NY Sweep Program. 
At the present time, the DB AG NY Sweep Program is not available to retirement accounts (including ERISA Plan and IRA 
accounts), governmental plans, and managed advisory accounts. 
You must make an initial deposit of $250,000 or more into the MMDA. The balance need not remain at or above $250,000 
and there is no minimum amount for subsequent deposits. The program may be subject to additional eligibility requirements 
established by us or by the regulators of Deutsche Bank AG or its affiliates from time to time. 
Summary of Certain Relationships 
OBS! is a broker-dealer registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a member of the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority and the New York Stock Exchange, and is not a bank. Branch Deposit Accounts are held 
by the Branch and not by Pershing or DBSI. 
DBTCA performs certain administrative, recordkeeping and communication services for the DB AG NY Sweep Program. 
DBTCA is a corporate affiliate of OB51. 
Pershing, DBSI's clearing broker, acts as exclusive custodian and agent with respect to all transactions related to the DB AG 
NY Sweep Program. The Branch Deposit Accounts established by Pershing for the deposits are evidenced by a book entry 
on the account records of the Branch. Pershing and its agents maintain records of your interest in each Branch Deposit 
Account. No evidence of ownership, such as a passbook or certificate, will be issued to you. Accordingly all transactions 
involving your funds in each Branch Deposit Account must be made through DBSI. 
DBSI assumes the responsibility and the risk of loss for any fund transfers of yours that have theretofore been delivered by 
you to Pershing until such time as the funds have been received by the Branch in the Branch Deposit Accounts. The amounts 
on deposit with the Branch are not obligations of, or guaranteed by, DBSI, Pershing or any of their affiliates or other third 
parties. In deciding whether to participate in the DB AG NY Sweep Program, you must rely on your own examination of 
Deutsche Bank AG and the Branch including the merits and risks involved. 
You will not have a direct account relationship with the Branch. However, each Branch Deposit Account constitutes an 
obligation of the Branch to you and is not directly or indirectly an obligation of ()BSI. Withdrawals are deemed paid by the 
Branch when the applicable funds are transmitted by the Branch to Pershing. The Branch is released from all liability for 
such withdrawn funds once the Branch delivers those funds to the Pershing. The Branch is not responsible for the actions of 
DBTCA or for the actions of Pershing with respect to the DB AG NY Sweep Program or otherwise. 
Deposits 
Funds are deposited into the MMDA under the following circumstances: (i) in the case of available cash balances resulting from 
the proceeds of securities sales, on the settlement date of the securities sales; and (ii) in the case of available cash balances 
resulting from non-trade related credits (e.g. the receipt of dividend or interest payments or a deposit in the brokerage account), 
on the business day after receipt by Pershing of the non-trade related credit. Funds deposited by Pershing into the Branch 
Deposit Account begin earning interest from the day that they are received by the Branch. As noted above, your deposit will be 
in book entry form and, therefore, you will not receive a passbook or a certificate. 
Withdrawals 
All withdrawals necessary to satisfy debits in your brokerage or transaction accounts are made by Pershing as your agent 
For example, a debit is created when you purchase securities or request withdrawal of funds from your brokerage account 
or when you write a check, or otherwise withdraw funds, such as through an Automated Clearing House. 
The funds necessary to satisfy debits in your DBSI securities account will first be obtained from the free credit balances in 
your brokerage account, if any, and then withdrawals will be made from the DB AG NY Sweep Program.
