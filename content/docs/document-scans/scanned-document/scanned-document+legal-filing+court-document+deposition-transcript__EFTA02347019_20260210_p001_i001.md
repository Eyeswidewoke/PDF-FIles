Re: 
Do we have a copy of the draft indictment? 
On Oct 28, 2014 7:13 AM, "jeffrey E." =It;jeevacation@gmail.com <mailto:jeevacation@gmail.com» =rote: 
The following if were a movie farce , would say "based on a=20 true story" however, it is not merely "based on" 
, it is 100=percent true, verifiable and with a total of over 10000 pages of docume=ts to backing up the story. Lets 
begin with a list of the ludic=ous , illegal, never before heard of madness that I endured as a result of an out of control 
AUSA. In Sept of 07 sh= required me to sign an agreement in which i agreed to pay a list of 40 =irls of her choosing. 
( as a material condition of the agreement specifically refusing to tell me even the names of any of these girls until 
AFTER = had signed the agreement, entered a plea and was already in jai= ) pay each an amount of money that the girls 
themselves decided with a minimum 50k each, and if I couldn't get them to agree. I would be required to pay a law firm 
to represent them to be able to file=l suit against me in court. If I argued in court that this agreement =as wrong. or if I 
should file motions to dismiss any filed girl case no=20 matter how frivolous or deficient as a matter of law , Marie said 
she=20 would consider it a breach of the NPA and indict me. This was no empty threat as she made more than one 
attempt to do so. and forced the withdrawal of my motion to dismiss a case in which i had=20 never even heard the 
girls name before the filing of a multi million dollar case . After suggesting her boyfriend be the lawyer to bring=20 suit 
on the girls behalf and that after that crazy suggestion being=20 turned down . Bob Josefburgs's firm in Miami was 
chosen by her. =o represent girls that could not find their own attny. In additi=n to marie having me pay , any fee billed 
includingQ=A0 josephbergs firm over a million dollars ( adding to the farce he hired his=20 daughter , a sitting 
prosecutor to work on the case and she alone billed) 800k dollars. Marie made a point to state that if i tried to=20 
contest those fees, an indictment would be brought immediately. 
<=r> 
As part of the NPA , she required me ,not the federal govt, but me, to go to the state prosecutor., who after 
convening a grand jury, a rare event in itsel= as this was wholly local prostitution case. had decided t= charge me with 
solicitation of prostitution. and demand that he up the charges =o a sex registrable offense . Marie would not even share 
any evidence =f her alleged crimes with the state and wrote that if i was unable to=20 get the prosecutor to up the 
charge to a felony, that carried with it mandatory sex registration she would indict me. 
=br> 
Though the agreement stated I was to be trea=ed like any other inmate. she the sent letters and perso=ally 
met with the locals so i would not be given teh standard work release. and after i did get it, renewed her indictment 
documents and asked that I stay in jail 24 hrs a day . While on work release she again tr=ed to declare a breach stating 
that i had walked on the wrong street to work. 
The threatened indictment of 53 pages. carried federal allegations of a panoply of wild sex crimes.. money 
laundering ( though all th= money was earned by me), sex trafficking. - the girls taking a cab to come=20 to my house.
in some cases from the strip club in which they =orked ) travel for the purpose of sex . though it was all domestic 
t=avel from my new york house to my vacation home of 20 years in Florida. no=20 domestic travel law, except the 
Mann act ( researched ) but no=girls traveled . using the means of interstate commerce to troll for=20 underage girls .
