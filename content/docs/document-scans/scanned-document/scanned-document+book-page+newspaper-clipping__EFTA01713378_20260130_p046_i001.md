and soon•to•be father of her child. Details of McMahan 
and Linda's extraordinary wedding at Westminster Abbey 
and their years as lovers come from court documents as 
well as Linda's videotaped deposition, which New Times 
has made available on its website, 
browardpalmbeach.com. 
In court papers, McMahan denies that he ever had a 
sexual affair with his daughter. But he doesn't explain 
how his and Linda's DNA turned up on a vibrator that 
Linda's husband uncovered in her luggage. McMahan also 
hints that Linda may not be his biological daughter, 
despite a DNA test he paid for showing with 99.7 percent 
probability that he is her father. 
When New Times began gathering court records and 
calling individuals involved in the lawsuits several weeks 
ago, McMahan declined to comment for this article. He 
hired a Los Angeles public relations firm to field New 
Times queries. He also made three requests to seal 
court documents in Miami and San Diego that three 
judges denied. 
Then, on September 13, as this article was being 
prepared for print. all five lawsuits were settled on 
undisclosed terms. As part of the settlement, a federal 
judge in San Diego sealed the files of the California 
lawsuit and took the rare step of wiping out any record 
that the lawsuit had ever existed.

Linda Marie Hodge McMahan Schutt 
prepares to tell the whole, sordid truth. 
Through McMahan 's L.A. public relations firm, the parties sent a statement to New Times, 
describing the matter as a mere 'family dispute: and alluded to taking legal action if this 
newspaper published this article, which is drawn from the information in the court cases that 
McMahan has gone to such lengths to hide from public view. 
Bruce McMahan began the seduction of his daughter one evening in the spring of 1998 by having 
her look over his business writings in the library of his lavish Pelham, New York, estate. 
Linda Schutt described the events of that evening earlier this year in a deposition that was taken 
in Jackson, Mississippi, on April 6. McMahan declined to comment when New Times reached him on 
the telephone, and he never testified in any of the litigation. But according to Linda's testimony, 
that night in 1998, McMahan 's fourth wife, Cynthia, was at a spa, and a housekeeper was 
somewhere on the premises. 
"He opened a bottle of wine. He poured me a glass of wine, and we drank together." 
While they leafed over his writings. he began to tell her of his sexual relationships with past 
women. He preferred them slender with wide cheekbones. He told me he liked to buy furs for 
women and have sex with women on mink coats." 
McMahan, who was then around his 59th birthday, asked his daughter, 29, to move to his bedroom 
and watch the first 30 minutes of the movie 8roveheort. He wanted her to see the love story and 
clandestine wedding that unfolds in the opening act of Mel Gibson's film because, Linda testified,
