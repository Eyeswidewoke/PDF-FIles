None of the country=92s competing armed factions are capable of governing alone. Each wishes t= protect its special 
privileges while preventing its opponents from govern=ng. Libya is truly ruled by everyone and no one. 
In the early days o= the anti-Qaddafi rebellion, the rebels' top brass attempted to form a n=scent national army, yet 
various "civilian" (read: Islamist) groups re=used to submit to the proposed chain of command. In July 2011, Islamists 
were suspected in the murder of the national army=92s leader, Gen. Abdul Fattah Younes. Since then, myriad civilian 
militias=have proliferated. They dwarf the national army and police force combined.=The government has tried to co-
opt some of the civilian brigades with big salaries and fancy titles, but most=remain loyal only to their commanders. 
Consequently, the L=byan government lacks even 100 armed men who would lay their lives on the =ine to defend the 
abstract concept of the state. Conversely, the militias =an rely on thousands. 
In Western Libya, t=e most staunchly anti-government forces are a loose alliance of Islamists =nd certain powerful 
militias from the city of Misurata. Counterbalancing t=em are non-Islamist militias from the city of Zintan. In the East, 
"federalist<=a>" militias seek to obtain "justice" (meaning more power and money for their regio=).

As a result of this=multipolar struggle, the country has become virtually ungovernable. Each group has its supporters 
inside the parliament: the Martyrs and the M=slim Brotherhood blocs have worked to further the influence 
<http://blogs.=euters.com/faithworld/2013/013/25/libyas-muslim-brotherhood-seen-gaining-in=luence-amid-countrys-
disarrayk of the Revo=utionaries Operations Room — the group that kidnapped Mr. Zeidan. With t=e Islamists' 
support, Noun Abusahmain became Libya's president in Jun=. And he quickly bolstered his power as a counterweight to 
the prime minister by endowing the Revolutionaries Operations Room with=$700 million. 
Prime Minister Zeid=n's various opponents have long sought <http://www.globalpost.=om/dispatch/news/thomson-
reuters/131010/libyas-pm-was-embattled-even-his-b=ief-capture> to force him out o= office. Despite his waning 
popularity and effectiveness, they failed to o=st him via a secret no-confidence vote on Oct. 1. He survived the vote 
not=because he enjoys widespread support but rather because no one can agree on who should replace him. 
The American raid t=at captured Mr. Rucjai, also known as Abu Anas al-Libi, fueled outrage with=n certain sections of the 
population. Mr. Zeidan's opponents tried to ca=italize on this by highlighting the prime minister's alleged complicity with 
Washington. Upon seizing the prime mi=ister, the abductors proclaimed that they were defending Libya's honor a=d 
sovereignty rather than their own narrow interests. 
Their use of politi=al symbolism was astute. Their actions said, in effect, "America came he=e to Libya and violated 
Libyan sovereignty by kidnapping al-Libi. In retur=, we will retaliate by kidnapping someone whom the West cares 
about." So they abducted their own prime minister in=Tripoli's Corinthia Hotel, the place most associated in the popular 
mind=with Westerners and their dealings with the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qadd=fi. By linking Mr. Zeidan to the 
West and the old regime, the Islamist militias cleverly positioned themselves a= the defenders of the revolution. But this 
symbolism is built on myths, hy=erbole and lies. It is an attempt to deflect attention from the militias=92 blatant abuse 
of power. 
Libya's leadershi= must put an end to the militias' mythology by finally defending itself =n the court of public opinion. In 
his post-release news conference, Mr. Ze=dan pointed out that armed protesters routinely force their way into his 
office, demanding money or jobs. On the occasions=that their requests are declined, they turn to the media in an 
attempt to =in public support by claiming that Mr. Zeidan is "installing Qaddafi goons 
<http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/oct/10/losing-lib=as-revolution/?page=1> in government."</=pan> 
How Mr. Zeidan emer=es from this crisis will depend on his political savvy. His government mig=t fall because of his 
public humiliation — or he could muddle through. E=ther way, Western policy makers should seek not to support Mr. 
Zeidan or any other politician, but rather to =bolster the rule of law <http://pomed.org/wordpress/wp-
