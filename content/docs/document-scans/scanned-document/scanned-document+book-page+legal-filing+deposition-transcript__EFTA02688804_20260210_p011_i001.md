We recognize (58) as the conservation of probability, with current velocity v = la,s, and (59) as the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. 
Thus. we recover an ensemble of classical systems obeying the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. 
Note that if classical mechanics is construed to be an approximation to quantum dynamics. and the latter is a probabilistic 
theory of real ensembles, then so must be the former. That is why we derive classical mechanics in the form of an ensemble of 
systems whose probabilities evolve in a way that is driven by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. 
There appears to be a puzzle here. It seems that an ensemble is required to derive classical mechanics as an approximation to 
the copy dynamics proscribed by (3738). But we have argued that macroscopic bodies have distinct quantum states. And yet. 
the derivation of classical dynamics depends on the beable occupation numbers being large. That is a consequence of the fact 
that we derived classical mechanics as an approximation to quantum mechanics, and therefor require the same conditions for its 
validity. Is there a contradiction here? 
The resolution of this apparent puzzle is that we can derive the classical description of motion from a model, which is a coarse 
grained description of the microscopic beables. Because beables really exist, there can be an exact or fine grained description 
in terms of beables that is unique and, at the same time, an equally valid coarse grained beables description in which the beable 
occupation numbers are large. We can use the latter approximation to study the coarse grained motion of the atoms in the body. 
All we have to do is show that beables representing the coarse grained translational states of individual atoms in a macroscopic 
body satisfy Newton's laws. It then follows that the centre of mass does as well. To accomplish this all we need is that the atoms 
can be described in terms of beables in such a way that they are in ensembles with large occupation numbers. To do this, we can 
employ coarse grained beables, which is the occupation numbers of boxes which are large in units of the atomic spacing. 
But if we choose the coarse graining sufficiently coarse so that there are many atoms of the body in each box, we are in the 
domain of large occupation numbers, just from the atoms contained in that macroscopic body. We can then use the ensemble 
which is at hand, which is that consisting of the atoms in the body itself. That means that the copy dynamics can work within the 
atoms of the body, when we restrict attention to the beables that represent a coarse grained measure of translational motion. To 
do this we consider the above to be a coarse grained model of an ensemble of atoms making up a body and we take the classical 
limit for the motion of each atom. 
There may be larger ensembles that our atoms arc a part of, but all that is needed for our purposes is that there be at least one. 
So long as there is an ensemble in which the occupation numbers are large we will derive quantum mechanics, whether that is a 
subensemble of a larger ensemble or not. 
While we have to choose a so the occupation numbers, na arc large. the validity of the semiclassical approximation requires 
also that the wavelengths are long, so we can neglect terms of order h, particularly the quantum potential. Hence, we choose the 
lattice spacing so that

In this approximation, p describes the ensemble of particles that make up the body, each of which propagates classically. Thus. 
the centre of mass of the body also behaves classically. So, under this set of assumptions, we have recovered the fact that the 
centre of mass of large bodies made of many atoms propagates according to classical dynamics. 
What we did is completely consistent with the principles this approach to quantum mechanics is based on, both in the use of 
beables and the insistence that all ensembles we invoke are physically real. But there is a a deeper level of explanation missing, 
which would be something analogous to a renormalization group calculation that connects the two levels of description. More 
ambitiously, if we knew more about the fundamental theory, which we assert quantum mechanics is an approximation to for 
small subsystems of the universe, we might be able to both understand the dynamics of unique systems in the universe and 
justify the derivation of the copy rule when applied to coarse grained descriptions of their I:cables. What we can say at this stage 
is that the use of coarse grained models like this is ubiquitous in condensed matter physics and experience shows such models 
usually succeed when they capture the coarse grained properties of interest in an experiment.
