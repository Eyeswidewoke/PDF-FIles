Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
• pay dividends to, or purchase stock from, our stockholders; 
enter into transactions with affiliates; 
• sell stock or other ownership interests in our subsidiaries; and 
• create or permit restrictions on our subsidiaries' ability to make 
payments to us. 
Our Senior Credit Facilities limit, and our New Credit Facility will limit, 
our ability to engage in these types of transactions even if we 
believed that a specific transaction would contribute to our future growth 
or improve our results of operations. Our Senior Credit Facilities require 
us to meet specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance 
with specified financial ratios. We are required to maintain two 
financial covenants, which include a Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio and 
a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the Senior 
Credit Facilities). These required ratios vary by quarter until maturity. 
Under the First Lien Credit Facility, we are required to maintain a maximum 
Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio of 6.58 to 1 and a minimum Consolidated 
Interest Coverage Ratio of 2.85 to 1 for the first quarter of 2015 
(7.00 to 1 and 1.55 to 1, respectively, under the Second Lien Credit 
Facility). As of March 29, 2015, our Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio was 
4.35 to 1 and our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio was 4.15 to 1 (each 
as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities). Under our New Credit 
Facility, we will be required to maintain a maximum Total Rent Adjusted 
Leverage Ratio (as defined under our New Credit Facility), at levels that 
may vary by quarter until maturity, and a minimum Consolidated Interest 
Coverage Ratio (as defined under our New Credit Facility), which, 
beginning with the third quarter ending September 27, 2015, will be 5.50 to 
1 and 2.80 to 1, respectively. In addition, as of March 29, 2015, on a 
pro forma basis after giving effect to the consummation of our initial 
public offering, the consummation of the refinancing of our existing Senior 
Credit Facilities and entry into, and effectiveness of, our New Credit 
Facility and our use of proceeds therefrom as set forth under "Use of 
Proceeds," our Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio would have been 3.69 to 1 
and our Interest Coverage Ratio would have been 13.38 to 1 (each 
as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities). As of the date hereof, we were 
in compliance with our Senior Credit Facilities' financial covenants. 
However, breach of these provisions or failure to comply with these 
financial ratios could result in a default under the Senior Credit 
Facilities or our New Credit Facility, in which case our lenders would have 
the right to declare borrowings to be immediately due and payable. Our 
lenders may also accelerate payment of borrowings upon the occurrence of 
certain change of control events relating to us. If we are unable to repay 
borrowings when due, whether at maturity or following a default or change of 
control event, our lenders would have the right to take or sell assets 
pledged as collateral to secure the indebtedness. Any such actions taken by 
our lenders or other creditors would have a material adverse effect on 
our business and financial condition.
