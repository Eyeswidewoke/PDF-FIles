Polygraph shows he didn't know girls' ages, lawyer says 1 
IP- EPSTEIN Ann 1 B 
using the 
"Funpin' 
Made El" 
who was

m e case, is a 
potentia 
prosecution wit-
ness 
According to Recarey. 
prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek 
offered Epstein attorneys 
Dershowitz and Guy Fronstin 
a plea deal in April. Fronstim 
after speaking with Epstein. 
accepted the deal. In which 
Epstein would plead guilty to 
one count of aggravated as-
sault with intent to commit a 
felony, be placed on five 
years' probation and have no 
criminal record. The deal al-
so called for Epstein to sub-
mit to a psychiatric and sex-
ual evaluation and have no 
unsupervised visits with mi-
nors, according to Recarey's 
report. The plea bargain was 
made in connect:on with only 
one of the five alleged vic-
tuns, the report states. 
Fronstin — who declined 
to comment on the case —
was subsequently fired and 
veteran defense attorney 
Jack Goldberger was hired. 
Ile denies there was any 
agreement by any of Ep-
stein's attorneys to a plea 
deal. 
We absolutely did not 
agree to a plea in this case; 
he said. Neither Belohlavek 
nor a state attorney's 
spokesman could be reached 
for comment

have no knowledge of 
it," defense attorney Gold-
berger saki. 
The report also says a 
woman connected to the Ep-
stein case was contacted by 
somebody who was still in 
touch with Epstein. That 
person told her she would be 
compensated if she didn't 
cooperate with police, Re-
carey' report says. Those 
who did talk "will be dealt 
with,' the woman said she 
was told. Phone records 
show the woman talked with 
the person who allegedly in-
timidated her around the 
time she said. Recarey re-
po e . 
Phone records also show 
that the person said to have 
made the threat then placed a 
call to Epstein's personal as-
sistruit who in turn called a 
New York corporation affili-
ated with Epstein. the report 
states. 
The issue in the Epstein 
case is not whether females 
came to his waterfront home, 
but whether he knew their 
ages 
"lies never denied girls 
came to the house." Gold-
berger said. But when Ep-
stein was given a polygraph 
test, "he passed on knowl-
edge of age,' the attorney 
said. 
After the indictment 
against Epstein was unsealed 
this week, Police Chief Reiter 
referred the matter to the 
FBL We've received the re-
ferret and we're reviewing 
it," said FBI spokeswoman 
Judy Orihuda in Miami. 
The chief himself has 
cane under attack from Ep-
stein's lawyers and friends in 
New York where he has a 
home. The New York Post 
quoted 
ein's prominent 
New York lawyer. Gerald 
Lefcourt as saying his client 
was indicted only 'because of 
the craziness of the police 
chief." 
Reiter has declined to 
comment on the case. 
Prosecutors have not 
presented a sex-related case 
Eke Epstein's to a grand jury 
before, said bike Edmond-
son, spokesman for the state 
attorney's office:That's what 
you do with a case that falls 
into a gray area." he said. 
Tice state attorney's office 
did not recommend a partic-
ular criminal charge on 
which to indict Epstein, Ed-
mondson said. The grand ju-
ry was presented with a list of 
charges from highest to low-
est then deliberated with the 
prosecutor out of the room. 
he said. 
'People are surprised at 
the grand jury proceeding" 
West Palm Beach defense 
attorney Richard Tendler 
said. "It's a way for the pros-
ecutor's office to not take the 
full responsibility for not fil-
ing the (charge), and not do-
ing what the Palm Beach Po-
lice Department wanted. I 
think something fell apart 
with those underage wit-
nesses." 
Defense attorney Robert 
Gershman was a prosecutor 
for six years. 'Those girls 
must have been Incredible or 
untrustworthy, I don't know,' 
he said. 
Other attorneys said Ep-
stein's case raises the issue of 
whether wealthy, connected 
defendants bite Epstein —
whose friends include former 
President Clinton and 
Donald Tnunp — are treated 
differently from others. Once 
he knew he was the subject of 
a criminal probe. Epstein 
hired a phalanx of powerful 
attorneys such as Dershowitz 
and Lefcourt. who is a past 
president of the National As
of CriminalDefense 
lawyers. 
Miami lawyer Roy Black 
— who became nationally 
known when he successfully 
defended William Kennedy 
Smith on a rape charge in 
Prim Beach — also was in-
vohtcl at one point 
Said defense attorney 
Michelle Suskauer: "I think 
k's unfortunate the public 
may get the perception that 
with power, you may be 
treated differently Man the
