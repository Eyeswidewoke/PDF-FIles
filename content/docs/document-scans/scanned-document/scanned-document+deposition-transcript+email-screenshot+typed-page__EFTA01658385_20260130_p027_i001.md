we're having announcements about a potential cure. Every day we're having announcements 
about a potential vaccine. We're going to get there, and we're going to get there pretty quickly. 
We will get this ugly monster under control." 
Biden: Trump "Seems To Be Incompetent" To Deal With Corona virus. Joe Biden 
said on MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell ReportsVi (8/27, 1.25M), "Did you ever see any 
Administration put so much pressure on the FDA? ... There's no bounds to what this guy does 
and his team does. We should listen to the scientists. ... Look, right from the beginning, I laid 
out a plan as to how to proceed — all the way back in January, and then again in March and 
April...all the way down the line. ... This guy doesn't believe in science, or at least if he heard it, 
he doesn't understand it. He just seems to be incompetent to deal with these things." 
WTimes Analysis: RNC Message On Virus A Stark Contrast To Democrats. The 
Washington Times (8/27, Howell, 492K) reports that "people who watched the Republican and 
Democratic national conventions a mere week apart could be forgiven for thinking they lived in 
two different countries, each with its own reality." Vice President Pence "described a lightning-
fast response" to the virus, "one week after Democrats said the effort to beat back the 
coronavirus was a failure across the board." To the Times, "which side the American people see 
as credible could decide the election, as voters take stock of the virus...and the man who is 
best equipped to lead the nation out of the pandemic's shadow." 
White House Announces $760M Deal To Provide 15014 Rapid Tests. 
The Washington Post (8/27, Bernstein, Kim, 14.2M) reports the White House announced a $760 
million deal Thursday with Abbott Laboratories to produce 150 million rapid coronavirus tests 
that will allow users to obtain results in 15 minutes. The announcement "came just hours 
before President Trump was scheduled to deliver his nomination speech at the close of the 
Republican National Convention." White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted, "This 
is a major development that will help our country to remain open, get Americans back to work, 
and kids back to school!" To the Post, the move "is the federal government's biggest step into 
testing." 
FDA Grants Emergency Authorization To Abbott Rapid Test. The CBS Evening 
NewsVi (8/27, story 6, 1:40, O'Donnell, 4.26M) reported, "There's a new, simple, cheap and 
fast coronavirus test just approved by the FDA and is being hailed as a game changer." CBS' 
Manuel Bojorquez added, "The FDA gave Abbott's $5 antigen test emergency approval and 
results in 15 minutes could help screen who could board a plane or enter a classroom. But 
antigen tests are generally less sensitive than lab tests and that can increase the risk of a false 
negative." 
CDC Clarifies Testing Guidelines Amid Outcry. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (8/27, story 7, 1:45, Holt, 5.69M) reported, "The CDC is walking back its 
new guidelines on who should be tested for coronavirus after an outcry from public health 
officials." NBC's Anne Thompson added, "Pummeled by criticism, today the CDC clarifying the 
new testing guidelines. In a statement, saying testing may be considered for all close contacts 
of confirmed or probable COVID-19 patients, walking back yesterday's recommendation — still 
on the CDC website - that people exposed to COVID but without symptoms do not necessarily 
need a test." 
On the CBS Evening NewsVi (8/27, story 6, 1:40, O'Donnell, 4.26M), Manuel Bojorquez 
likewise reported that "amid sharp criticism," CDC Director Redfield "tried to clarify" the new 
guidelines, "saying testing those individuals may be considered." 
The Hill (8/27, Wilson, 2.98M) quotes Redfield as saying, "Testing is meant to drive 
actions and achieve specific public health objectives. Everyone who needs a COVID-19 test, can 
get a test. Everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test; the key is to engage 
the needed public health community in the decision with the appropriate follow-up action."
