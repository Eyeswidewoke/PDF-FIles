Adjustment of credit default basket options for a 
complete redemption. In the case of a single or multiple 
payout credit default basket option, if a complete 
redemption event occurs with respect to one of the 
reference entities in the basket and no credit event is 
confirmed. pursuant to the rules of the listing options 
market, to have occurred prior to the effective date of such 
redemption event, the options will be adjusted by removing 
the affected reference entity from the basket of reference 
entities. When a reference entity is deleted from the basket 
of reference entitles because of a redemption event, the 
cash settlement amount of the option will be reduced by an 
amount reflecting the weight of the deleted reference entity 
in the basket. The relative weights of the other components 
in the basket will remain unchanged, although each will 
represent a proportionally larger percentage of the adjusted 
cash settlement amount 
EXAMPLE: Company XYZ is one of ten reference 
entities for a class of multiple payout credit default option 
contracts and its 8% May 15, 2022 bond issue is specified as 
its only reference obligation. Company XYZ was assigned a 
weight of 15% when the credit default option was opened for 
trading. During the life of the option. Company XYZ redeems 
the 8% May 15. 2022 bond Issue. No reference obligations 
remain and the listing options market determines that there 
are no other outstanding debt obligations of the issuer 
suitable for specification as reference obligations. The 
basket component will be removed from the credit default 
basket, and the cash settlement amount will be reduced by 
15%. 
Succession Event Adjustments. A succession event 
occurs when one or more new entities assume one or more 
reference obligations of a reference entity or become the 
obligor with respect to any obligation that is substituted for 
the original reference obligations. This may occur, for 
example. when a reference entity is merged into a new entity 
or spins off a part of its business into a new entity. If. as the 
result of a succession event, more than one entity is the 
obligor of the original reference obligations. or obligations 
that were substituted for the original reference obligations, 
all of those obligors. including, as the case may be. the 
original reference entity, are referred to as successor 
reference entities. 
Adjustment of credit default options after a succession 
event. Where a succession event results in assumption of all 
reference obligations by a single entity, the listing options 
market will ordinarily adjust the option by substituting the 
entity that assumes the reference obligabon(s) as the new 
reference entity. Where a succession event results in more 
than one successor reference entity, the credit default option 
may be adjusted by dividing it into two or more options. 
EXAMPLE: Company XYZ is the reference entity for a 
credit default option contract, and its 8% May t5, 2022 bond 
issue is the only reference obligation. During the life of the 
option, Company XYZ spins off Company LMN. Company 
XYZ remains the obligor with respect to 70% of the principal 
amount of the original reference obligation. Company LMN
