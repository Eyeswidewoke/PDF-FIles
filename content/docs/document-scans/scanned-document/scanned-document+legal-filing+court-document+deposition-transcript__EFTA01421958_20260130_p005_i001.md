(1) Target Gross IRR refers to portfolio returns after leverage and JV 
partner promotes but before fund-level expenses and fees (incl incentive 
fees). Individual asset targets may differ materially from the ranges shown. 
(2) Target Net IRR takes into account fund-level expenses and fees 
(including any incentive fee), but does not include the impact of tax 
benefits related to investing in QOZs. 
(3) Gross Assets under Management differs from Regulatory Assets Under 
Management, as reported in regulatory filings, and represents the gross 
appraised value of assets managed by GTIS and its joint venture 
partners as of 01 2019. Figures may include minority joint venture partners' 
ownership interests where applicable. Figures also include any Limited 
Partner unfunded commitments to GTIS separate accounts, funds 
and co- investment vehicles. Figures exclude both property-level debt as 
well as working capital at the joint venture or aggregating vehicle entities. 
(4) GTIS Global Investment Portfolio is composed of approx. $1.83B of equity 
committed to investments in the US and approx. $1.56B to investments in 
Brazil (at an FX rate of 3.29 BRL/USD). 
(5) Projected gross returns are based on GTIS's latest monthly cash flow 
projections for the asset, generally using the IRR function in Excel with 
monthly compounding. Projected multiple is calculated as the sum of the 
projected peak equity requirement and projected profit divided by the 
projected peak equity requirement. The projections do not include the impact 
of any taxes paid on behalf of the limited partners.
