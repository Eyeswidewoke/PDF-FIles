AGP LP 519 Alpha Group Capital Paul Barrett 
penalty, and $6.62 million prejudgment interest; and Merrill and BOAMS consented to permanent 
injunctions against violations of Securities Act §5(b)(1). 
With respect to the Securities Act §17(a)(2) and (3), the SEC alleged that BANA, BOAMS and Merrill (1) 
underwrote a prime RMBS ("BOAMS 2008-A") and failed to comply with its representation that each 
underlying mortgage complied with Respondents' underwriting guidelines; (2) did not disclose the 
percentage of loans collateralizing BOAMS 2008-A that were originated by third-party mortgage brokers 
("wholesale channel loans") and the risks attendant with such loans (specifically, that wholesale channel 
loans were more likely to have material underwriting errors, become delinquent, fail early in the life of the 
loan, or to prepay); and (3) provided investors and rating agencies with documents that materially 
misrepresented material facts about debt to income and original combined loan-to-value ratios for the 
loans underlying BOAMS 2008-A. 
With respect to Securities Act §5(b)(1), the SEC alleged that BAS and BOAMS disclosed data, including 
preliminary loan tapes, which reflected the percentage of wholesale channel loans collateralizing BOAMS 
2008-A to certain, but not all, investors and that BAS and BOAMS did not file this data with the SEC. 
Rule 506(d) and (e) under Regulation D under the Securities Act require that issuers of Rule 506 
private placement offerings include disclosures of prior "bad acts" by covered persons (including 
but not limited to directors, officers, promoters, and solicitors) which resulted in a conviction or 
administrative sanction for securities fraud or other violations of specified laws before September 
23, 2013. 
1. On December 7, 2010, the SEC issued an administrative and cease-and-desist order (the '2010 
Order") finding that BAS willfully violated Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange 
Act") §15(c)(1)(A) when certain employees participated in improper bidding practices involving the 
temporary investment of municipal securities proceeds during the 1998-2002 period. The 2010 Order 
censured BAS, and ordered BAS to (1) cease and desist from committing or causing such violations and 
future violations, and (2) pay $36.096,442 disgorgement and prejudgment interest. BAS consented to the 
order without admitting or denying the SEC's findings. 
2. On January 25, 2011, the SEC issued an order (the "2011 Order") finding that (1) between February 
2003 and February 2005, Merrill market makers executing institutional customer orders for securities 
sometimes shared information concerning those trades with traders on a Merrill securities proprietary 
trading desk; (2) at times, the traders used that information to place trades for Merrill after execution of 
the institutional customer order; (3) the foregoing was improper and contrary to Merrill's confidentiality 
representations to its customers;(4) there were instances between 2002 and 2007 when Merrill charged 
institutional and high net worth customers undisclosed mark-ups and mark-downs on riskless securities 
principal trades for which Merrill had agreed to charge the customer only a commission equivalent fee; (5) 
in doing so, Merrill acted improperly and contrary to its customer agreement; (6) from 2002-2007, Merrill 
failed in many instances to make records of its agreements with institutional customers to guarantee an 
execution price, which agreements were part of the terms and conditions of the institutional customer 
orders; (7) as a result of its conduct, Merrill willfully violated Exchange Act (i) §15(c)(1)(A) by effecting 
transactions in securities by means of manipulative, deceptive or other fraudulent devices or 
contrivances, and (ii) §15(g) by failing to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information; (8) under Exchange Act 
§15(b)(4)(E), Merrill failed reasonably to supervise its traders with a view toward preventing them from 
violating the federal securities laws: and (9) Merrill willfully violated Exchange Act §17(a) and Rule 17a-
3(A)(6) by failing to record certain terms and conditions of customer orders. Merrill neither admitted nor 
denied the findings in the 2011 Order. 
The 2011 Order (1) required that Merrill cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and 
any future violations of Exchange Act §§15(c)(1)(A), 15(g) and 17(a) and Rule 17a-3(A)(6) thereunder; (2) 
censured Merrill pursuant to Exchange Act §15(b)(4); and (3) required that Merrill pay a $10 million civil 
monetary required pursuant to Exchange Act §§15(b)(4) and 21B.
