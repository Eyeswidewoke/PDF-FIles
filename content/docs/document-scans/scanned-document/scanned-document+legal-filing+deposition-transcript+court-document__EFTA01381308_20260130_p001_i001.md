CON eminent Regulation 
Blue Buffalo, along with its contract manufacturers, distributors and ingredients and packaging suppliers. is subject to extensive 
regulation in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities including the FDA, the United States Department of Agriculture, 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the EPA. as well as state and local agencies. with respect to registrations, production processes. product 
attributes, packaging. labeling, storage and distribution. We believe that we arc in material compliance with all regulations applicable to our 
business. 
Pet Food-Related Regulation 
The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, or CVM. regulates animal feed. including pet food. under the FFDCA and its implementing 
regulations. Although pet foods arc not required to obtain premarket approval from the FDA. any substance that is added to or is expected to 
become a component of a pct food must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation. unless it is generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, 
under the conditions of its intended use. A food additive regulation may be obtained through the submission of a food additive petition to the FDA 
demonstrating that a food additive is safe for its intended use and has utility. Use of a food ingredient that is neither GRAS nor an approved food 
additive may cause a food to be adulterated, in which case the food may not be legally marketed in the United States. 
The labeling of pet foods is regulated by both the FDA and some state regulatory authorities. FDA regulations require proper 
identification of the product, a net quantity statement, a statement of the name and place of business of the manufacturer or digributor, and proper 
listing of all the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. The FDA also considers certain specific claims on pet food labels to be medical 
claims and therefore subject to prior review and approval by the FDA. These include claims such as "hairball control," "improved digestibility" and 
"urinary tract health." In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 requires the FDA to establish ingredient standards 
and definitions for pet food, processing standards for pet food, and updated labeling standards for pet food that include nutritional and ingredient 
information. The FDA is currently working to implement these requirements. 
The FDA has recently identified concerns regarding products that provide nutrients in support of an animal's daily nutrient needs but 
which are also labeled as being intended for use to diagnose, curt, mitigate, treat or prevent disrase, thereby meeting the statutory definitions of 
both a food and a drug. In the past. the FDA has generally exercised discretion with regard to enforcement of the regulatory requirements 
applicable to animal
