DEAR FRIEND 
As many=of you know I am a huge fan of Bill Maher is one of the most politically astute comedians in=America today. His 
unflinching honesty and commitment to never pulling a punch have garnered him the respect and admiration of millions 
of fans. In 2003, Ma=er launched a new show, "Real Time with Bill Maher," o= HBO, a network that's a perfect fit for his 
irreverent style. The hour-long show ai=s live at 11:00PM on Friday nights. 
For the past several weeks, I posted a section of his 'New Rules" segment, but last wee= he countered Tea Baggers and 
Conservatives who see Government as the Villain, with a =iece on how California liberal/progressive Governor, Jerry 
Brown was able to turn around the economy, by working together with Republicans and Independents t= raise taxes and 
cut taxes, while supporting legislation that helped homeown=rs saved their houses, funded infrastructural maintenance, 
addressing inequ=lity, reducing unemployment, embracing Obamacare and the environment, at the same time, turning 
a $27 bi=lion deficit into a surplus in less than four years. With this in mind, I cho=e to start this week's offerings with 
the text of the segment as it is a thought provoking thesis =hat the rest of American maybe should follow. 
New Rule: Conservatives Who Love to Brag A=out American Exceptionalism Must Come Here to California 
New Rule: Conservatives who love to brag about American exceptionalism must come here=to California, and see it in 
person. And then they should be afraid -- very afraid. Because while the rest of the country is beset by stories of right-
=ing takeovers in places like North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin, California is going in the opposite direction and 
creating the kind of modern, liberal na=ion the country as a whole can only dream about. And not only can't the res= of 
the country stop us -- we're going to drag you along with us. 
It wasn't that long ago that pundits were calling California a failed state and sayin= it was ungovernable. But in 2010, 
when other states were busy electing whateve= Tea Partier claimed to hate government the most, we elected a guy who 
actua=ly liked it, Jerry Brown. 
Since then, everything Republicans say can't or won't work -- gun control= immigration reform, high-speed rail --
California is making work. And everything conservatives claim will unravel the fabric of our society -- universal 
healthcare, higher taxes on the rich, gay marriage, medical marij=ana -- has only made California stronger. And all we 
had to do to accomplish th=t was vote out every single Republican. Without a Republican governor and wit=out a 
legislature being cock-blocked by Republicans, a $27 billion deficit was turned into a surplus, continuing the proud 
American tradition of Republica=s blowing a huge hole in the budget and then Democrats coming in and cleaning=it up.
