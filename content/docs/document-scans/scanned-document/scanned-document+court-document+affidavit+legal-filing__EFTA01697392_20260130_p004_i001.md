decide to have sex with a child. Such reasons might include simple availability, curiosity, or a 
desire to hurt a loved one of the molested child. The sexual fantasies of such individuals do not 
necessarily focus on children, and these people are not pedophiles. 
Are child molesters with adolescent victims pedophiles? Are individuals who collect both child'
and adult pornography pedophiles? Is everyone using a computer to facilitate having sex with 
children, or trafficking in child pornography, a pedophile? Many child molesters are, in fact, 
pedophiles, and many pedophiles are child molesters. But they are not necessarily one and the 
same. Labeling all child molesters as pedophiles can be confusing. Often, it may be unclear 
whether the term is being applied with its diagnostic or with some other definition. Most 
investigators and prosecutors are not qualified to apply the term with its diagnostic meaning. 
1 recommend that investigators and prosecutors minimize the use of the term "pedophile." For the 
purposes of this discussion, the term "pedophile" when used will be defined as a significantly 
older individual who, prefers to have sex with individuals legally considered children. Pedophiles 
are individuals whose erotic imagery and sexual fantasies focus on children. They do not settle 
for child victims, but, in fact, prefer to have sex with children. The law, not puberty, determines 
who is a child. A pedophile is just one example or subcategory of what I refer to as a 
"preferential sex offender." The term preferential sex offender is merely a descriptive label used 
only to identify, for investigative and prosecutive purposes, a certain type of offender. The term 
does not appear in the DSM-IV-TR and it is not intended to imply or to be used for clinical 
diagnosis. 
It is important to realize that to refer to someone as a pedophile is to say only that the individual 
has a sexual preference for children. It says little or nothing about the other aspects of his 
character and personality. To assume that someone is not a pedophile simply because he is nice, 
goes to church, works hard, is kind to animals, and so on, is absurd. Pedophiles span the full 
spectrum from saints to monsters. In spite of this fact, over and over again pedophiles are not 
recognized, investigated, charged, convicted, or sent to prison simply because they are "nice 
guys."

Typology of Sex Offenders 
When distinctions between types of offenders need to be made, I recommend the use of a 
descriptive typology developed for criminal justice, purposes. This discussion will set forth such a 
typology. 
My original typology of child molesters was developed in the mid-1980's and was published and 
widely disseminated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in a 
monograph entitled Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis. It was revised in April 1987 (2s
edition) and again in December 1992 (3rd edition). It divided child molesters into two categories 
(Situational or Preferential) and into seven patterns of behavior. Although still useful, this old 
. 
typology has several limitations and has been updated by a new typology that places sex 
offenders, not just child molesters, along a motivational continuum (Situational to Preferential) 
instead of into one of two categories. Although motivation can often be difficult to determine, it
