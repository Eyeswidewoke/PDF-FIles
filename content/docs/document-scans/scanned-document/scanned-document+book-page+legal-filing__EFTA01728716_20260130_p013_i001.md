Investigating Acquaintance 
Sexual Exploitation 
This chapter is intended to offer general guidelines on how to apply the previ-
ously discussed behavioral dynamics to the investigation and prosecution of cases 
of sexual exploitation of children perpetrated by acquaintance molesters. 
Intrafamilial, child-sexual-abuse cases can be difficult to prove in a court of 
law. Frequently there is only the word of one child against that of an adult. This is, 
however, rarely the case in child-sexual-exploitation cases especially those involv-
ing preferential sex offenders. With multiple victims, no one victim should have 
to bear the total burden of proof, and cases should rarely, if ever, be severed for 
prosecution. The best victims and cases should be selected for prosecution. It will 
be extremely difficult to convict a prominent, well-respected member of the com-
munity based only on the testimony of one troubled, delinquent adolescent or 
one confused, naive young child. 
It is commonly accepted that child sexual victimization is a complex problem 
requiring the efforts and coordination of many agencies and disciplines. No one 
agency or discipline possesses the personnel, resources, training, skills, or legal 
mandate to deal effectively with every aspect of child maltreatment. In this 
context law enforcement interacts with a variety of professions and agencies dur-
ing the investigation process. For example some offenders cross jurisdictional 
boundaries, and many violate a variety of state and federal laws when exploiting 
children. This often will mean working with other local, state, and 'federal 
law-enforcement agencies in multijurisdictional investigative teams and with pros-
ecutors, social services, and victim assistance in multidisciplinary teams. This can 
be done as part of informal networking or a formal task force. 
The multidisciplinary approach not only is advantageous 
in avoiding duplication and making cases but is also in the 
best interests of the child victim. It may minimize the num-
ber of interviews and court appearances and provide the 
victim with needed support. The team approach can also 
help investigators deal with the stress and isolation of this 
work by providing peer support. The multidisciplinary 
approach is mandated statutorily or authorized in the 
majority of states and under federal law (U.S. Department 
of Justice, 1993). 
Working together as part of a multidisciplinary team means coordination not 
abdication. Each discipline performs a function for which it has specific resources, 
training, and experience. Although each discipline must understand how its role 
contributes to the team approach, it is equally important that it understands the 
respective responsibilities and limitations of that role. For example child-protec-
tion agencies usually cannot get involved in cases in which the alleged perpetrator 
is not a parent or caretaker (i.e., acquaintance molester). 
The team approach is a two-way street. Just as medical and psychological 
professionals are charged with evaluating and treating the abused or neglected 
child, law-enforcement investigators are responsible for conducting criminal 
With multiple victims, no one 
victim should have to bear 
the total burden of proof and 
cases should rarely; if ever, 
be severed for prosecution.
