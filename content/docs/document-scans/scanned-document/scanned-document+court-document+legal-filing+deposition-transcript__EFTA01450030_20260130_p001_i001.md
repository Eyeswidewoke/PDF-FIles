Delivery Amount. Subject to Paragraphs 4 and 5, upon a demand made by the Secured Party on or 
promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Delivery Amount for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the 
Pledgor's Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Pledger will Transfer to the Secured Party Eligible Credit Support 
having a Value as of the date of Transfer at least equal to the applicable Delivery Amount (rounded pursuant to 
Paragraph 13). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13, the "Definny Amount" applicable to the Pledgor for

Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Secured Party will Transfer to the Pledgor Posted Credit Support specified 
by the Pledgor in that demand having a Value as of the date of Transfer as close as practicable to the applicable 
Return Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 13). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13, the "Return 
Amount' applicable to the Secured Party for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which: 
(i) the Value as of that Valuation Date of all Posted Credit Support held by the Secured Party 
exceeds 
(ii) the Credit Support Amount.

to the Pledgor, if any, minus (iii) all Independent Amounts applicable to the Secured Party, if any, minus (iv) the
