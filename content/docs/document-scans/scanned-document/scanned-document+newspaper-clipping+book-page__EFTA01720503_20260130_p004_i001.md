nor 
looked far and wide to try to get the PERFECT 
person to interview for you. I wanted to get 
someone special. I wanted to get someone 
sexy. I wanted to get someone red hot. I want-
ed to get someone that you would be so inter-
ested in that you just HAD to read this month's 
column! Over the last two years I have inter-
viewed the biggest porn stars and magazine 
models but this time : thought about doing 
someone really special. So this month I 
chose...NE! That's right, fresh off of my 
appearance on the cover of the NEW TIMES 
magazine (along with the Smut Drs 8 page arti-
cle) it's pretty evident: NO ONE is hotter than 
me right now! i know what you are thinking; 
"How to you interview yourself?" f guess this 
is one time when that bi-polar disorder comes 
in handy! Ha ha...For this interiew. I separat-
ed myself into two different personalities. The 
good Dr Johnny (the interviewer) and the bad 
erviewee 
he a g 
and bad inside us, I just let them out! Reacion 
n amazement tuckers! 
Good Dr Johnny: Hey you are getting a lot of 
main stream attention right now, has anything 
changed in your life? 
Bad Dr Johnny: No nothing has really 
changed. I mean its pretty funny all the people 
that want to talk to you again after they see 
you on the cover of a magazine. I had 3 ex-girl. 
friends "st.ddenly" have the urge to get in 
touch. Where were you bitches 2 months ago? 
Good Dr J: What do you say when they call? 
Bad Dr J: I don't say anything. I just don't 
answer the phone. Fuck em! 
Good Dr J: I heard a sex story about you and 
three girls one night in a limo on South Beach. 
Is it true? 
Bad Dr it You know the answer you dumb 
fuck...you were there. Although at this time I 
can not answer this question on the grounds 
may I criminate me... 
ay:: wante • to 
say that! 
Good Dr J: Ok, then any truth to the rumor 
that you were seen partying with a certain 
debutant at the MTV movie awards/ 
Bad Dr J: I was there. I was partying. I don't 
remember rruch after that. I heard I had fun 
Good Dr J: I am starting to get annoyed with 
these answers 
Bad Dr J: Yea well I am starting to get 
annoyed with you. I can hear you in my head 
all the time when I am doing shit. Its either;" 
Take your vitamins in the morning" or "Maybe 
you should wait for her to wake up before you 
fuck her" I am sick of your shit. Take a nap 
and let me have some fun!
