> If in NYC, would you prefer to host, or have a neutral venue and house

> I'm still thinking of first week of December (6th/7th/8th) which means we

• Here is the draft letter, so you see how Id frame it. 
> Subject: Rethinking Monetary Systems 
> Dear XXXX 
> I am delighted to invite you to a private and confidential dialogue on 
> Rethinking Monetary Systems, running over 3 days, which will bring together 
> a maximum of 15 world experts. Your entire costs of attendance will be 
> covered, including the costs of your partner if you wish to bring them, and 
> a daily honorarium. My interest in convening this meeting is as a Professor 
> developing a research and teaching programme on this topic, and as a board 
> member of a leading community exchange system provider, but mostly as 
> someone who believes that we can no longer wait for someone else to show an 
> ambition that matches the scale of the problem. The intention is that this 
> meeting is the beginning of a sustained effort at better informing work on 
> reshaping monetary systems. Therefore, the philanthropist helping produce 
> this meeting has agreed to make a contribution of XXXX USD to each of two 
> projects that you co develop and agree to work on with some of the other 
> participants. 
> As you know, the ongoing effects of financial crisis are leading more 
> people to question the fundamentals of our monetary systems. Persistent 
> economic, social and environmental concerns have led others to campaign for 
> changes in monetary and banking systems, and to the creation of independent 
> exchange systems at community or small enterprise levels. Yet the responses 
> and reform agendas discussed by leaders in business, government, academia 
> and civil society appear to fall short of a fundamental rethink of monetary 
> systems - and consequent initiatives - to promote sustainable development. 
> There are various initiatives happening on monetary reform and on 
> alternative exchange systems. Despite some positive examples, the impact is 
> tiny in comparison to the size of the global economy. In order to create 
> new monetary or exchange systems that promote sustainable development there 
> needs to be a quantum leap in current efforts. For that to happen, there 
> needs to be a new strategic dialogue around transforming current monetary 
> systems. Those working on monetary reform and exchange alternatives need to 
> dialogue. Together, they also need to dialogue with professionals in 
> mainstream accounting, finance, derivatives, currencies and taxation. Then 
> they need dialogue with professionals working in relevant fields of social 
> change, communications and disruptive enterprise. 
> This is an ambitious and long term agenda. To begin with we must try to 
> find a workable common understanding and direction. For that, a small 
> gathering of brilliant minds from relevant professions is a necessary 
> starting point. 
> The event will begin with dinner on Thursday evening (insert date), and 
> continue on Friday and Saturday, concluding with a soiree on Saturday 
> evening (insert date). Sunday is free for fun or further conversation. 
> Administratively, the meeting is being produced with the help of XXXXX 
> [TBD: Cumbria, Community Forge, or Planetworkl, and the costs covered by a 
> private philanthropist, whom you will meet on the day.
