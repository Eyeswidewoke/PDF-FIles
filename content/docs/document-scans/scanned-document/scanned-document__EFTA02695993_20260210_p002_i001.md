Abstract 
Infants in intensive care units often undergo medically necessary heel-stick procedures. Because the risks of administering 
analgesics and anesthetics are often thought to outweigh the benefits, there remain no proven means of ameliorating the pain 
and stress these infants suffer, particularly during procedures. This study examined the controlled use of recorded vocal music 
to attenuate physiological and behavioral responses to heel stick In 13 premature infants via an experimental design. In both 
instances, infants exposed to music and infants in the control group, heart rate, and respiration rate increased during the 
heel-stick procedure (P's — .02) and nearly all infants cried. During a 10-minute recovery following the heel stick, heart rate, and 
crying significantly decreased in infants exposed to music (P = .02) but not in unexposed infants. Controlled music stimulation 
appears to be a safe and effective way to ameliorate pain and stress in premature infants following heel sticks.

Introduction 
Ample empirical evidence indicates that music stimulates 
cognitive, emotional, and sensoritnotor processing across widely 
distributed brain regions.I.2 The strong physiological and emo-
tional effects of music on many listeners" and the wealth of qua-
litative and quantitative findings provided by music therapy"' 
motivate the development of standardized protocols for the use 
of music in a wide range of clinical settings. Prospective, 
randomized-controlled clinical trials are needed in order to eluci-
date how music's effects can be harnessed to ameliorate suffering 
and, possibly, decrease morbidity and mortality independent of, 
and additive to, benefits related to therapist skills." Two recent 
Cochrane Database reviews have examined the use of music for 
pain relier and end-of-life care." 
Neonates, especially premature infants, constitute a needy 
population of patients who might benefit from the implementa-
tion of standardized protocols incorporating music for analge-
sia, stress reduction, and auditory enrichment." 1'13 The human 
cochlea is anatomically developed by 24 weeks gestational 
age.14 and auditory evoked responses have been recorded in 
premature infants as early as 26 weeks gestational age. I5.16 The 
results of many recent studies of the fetus and infant are consis-
tent with the notion that perceptual competence develops 
prenatally.'" Fetuses from 27 to 35 weeks gestational age 
demonstrate behavioral habituation to auditory stimuli." Heart 
rate (HR) changes in response to music have been observed 
in fetuses of 28 to 38 weeks gestational age.20 Functional 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies indicate left tem-
poral lobe activation to sound in fetuses at 33 weeks gestational 
age.2' Newborns demonstrate ERP sensitivity to 10% devia-
tions in tonal frequency.22 Approximately, 12% of the US 
births are premature (ie, before 37 weeks)23; about half of these 
require immediate hospital admission and many need long-
term care. Neurological complications of premature birth 
include learning disorders in as many as 2 in 5 school-age
