After careful consideration of the parties' written and oral arguments, I 
will deny the defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of personal 
jurisdiction and to transfer this case to New York. Further, I find that the 
amended complaint adequately states claims of breach of fiduciary duty and 
negligent misrepresentation. Finally, I will grant the defendants' motion to 
dismiss Counts I, II, III, and VI for failure to meet Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 9(b)'s heightened pleading requirement for fraud, but I will grant 
leave for the plaintiffs to amend their pleadings. 
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
In their amended complaint, Jeffrey E. Epstein ["Epstein"] and Financial 
Trust Company, Inc. ["FTC"] [collectively "plaintiffs"] allege that 
Citibank, N.A. ["Citibank"] and Citigroup, Inc. ["Citigroup"] [collectively 
"defendants"] misrepresented facts and fraudulently induced them to borrow 
$10 million to invest in a venture managed by AIG Global Investment 
Corporation ["AIG"]. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed to 
disclose information and negligently and fraudulently misrepresented facts 
concerning their relationship with AIG (Counts I, II, III, IV and VI), that 
the plaintiffs detrimentally relied on these misrepresentations (Counts I, 
II, III, and VI), and that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty to 
the plaintiffs (Count V). The plaintiffs seek rescission of the promissory 
note and punitive damages (Counts VI and VII). (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 45-68.) 
In April 1999, Dsyle Davison ["Davison"], Vice President of Citibank in New 
York and Epstein's private banker, and other Citibank employees telephoned 
Epstein while he was in the Virgin Islands and recommended that the 
plaintiffs invest through placement agent Salomon Smith Barney ["SSB"], a 
"subsidiary or affiliate" of the defendants, in a collateralized bond 
obligation transaction managed by AIG. (Compl. ¶¶ 12, 24; Epstein Decl. ¶1 
8-10; Davison Aff. 1¶ 1, 102-18.) According to the plaintiffs, during the 
negotiations of this deal Davison represented to Epstein that he was 
"virtually assured of receiving an 18-20% return on [his] investment, with a 
possible return of as much as 30%" and assured him that Citibank was going 
to remain actively involved in the investment. (Epstein Decl. ¶ 11.) 
After further discussion between Epstein and Davison, Citibank offered to 
loan Epstein $10 million on the express condition that the money be used 
exclusively to fund FTC's investment in the AIG-managed venture. (Id. ¶¶ 
12-13.) On August 2, 1999, Epstein exesuted a promissory note in favor of 
Citibank in the amount of $10 million [the "1999 Note"]. (Pis.' Mem. Of Law 
in Opp'n to Mot. To Dismiss, Epstein Decl. ¶ 15; Mem. Of Law in Support of 
Defs.' Mot. To Dismiss, Ex. A.) In addition, Citibank and FTC entered into a 
hypothecation agreement. (Mem. Of Law in Support of Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, 
Ex. B at 7.) 
On June 15, 2000, Epstein executed and delivered to Citibank an amended and 
restated promissory note ["the Amended 1999 Note"] that superseded the 1999 
Note. The Amended 1999 Note extended the maturity date of the 1999 Note to 
August 2, 2001. (Id. Ex. D.) In connection with the Amended 1999 Note, 
Epstein and FTC also signed an agreement entitled "First Amendment to Note
