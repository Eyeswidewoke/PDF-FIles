Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
The THL Funds will own a substantial portion of our capital stock after this 
offering and may have conflicts of interest with other 
stockholders in the future. 
The THL Funds will collectively beneficially own approximately 82% (or 80% 
if the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares is 
exercised in full) of our outstanding common stock following the completion 
of this offering. As a result, the THL Funds could exert significant 
influence over, and could control, matters requiring stockholder approval, 
including the election of directors and approval of major corporate 
transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or 
prevent a change of control of our company and make some transactions 
more difficult or impossible without the support of the THL Funds. 
The interests of the THL Funds may not always be consistent with the 
interests of our company or of other stockholders. Accordingly, the 
THL Funds could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements of which 
holders of our common stock would not approve or make decisions 
with which such holders would disagree. 
The THL Funds are in the business of making investments in companies and 
could from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses 
that compete with us. The THL Funds may also pursue acquisition 
opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, 
desirable acquisitions may not be available to us. 
An active market for our common stock may not develop, which could make it 
difficult for you to sell your shares at or above the initial 
public offering price. 
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of our 
capital stock. We have applied to list our common stock on the 
NASDAQ under the symbol "FOGO." However, we cannot assure you that an active 
public trading market for our common stock will develop on 
that exchange or elsewhere or, if developed, that any market will be active 
or sustained. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of 
any such market, your ability to sell your shares of common stock or the 
prices that you may obtain upon sale of your shares. As a result, you could 
lose all or part of your investment in our common shares. 
We will be a "controlled company" within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as 
a result, will be exempt from certain corporate 
governance requirements. 
Upon completion of this offering, the THL Funds will continue to hold 
capital stock representing a majority of our outstanding voting power. 
So long as the THL Funds maintain holdings of more than 50% of the voting 
power of our capital stock, we will be a "controlled company" within 
the meaning of NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under these standards, 
a company need not comply with certain corporate governance 
requirements, including: 
• the requirement that a majority of our board of directors consist of 
"independent directors" as defined under NASDAQ rules; 
• the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed 
entirely of independent directors with a written charter 
addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities;
