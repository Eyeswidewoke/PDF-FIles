Portfolio Holdings (continued) 
Reporting requirements generally will be phased in over a three-year period, 
as follows: 
• Stock in a corporation acquired on or after January 1, 2011 
• Mutual funds and dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) shares acquired on or 
after January 1, 2012 
• Options and any Debt Instruments that provide a simple fixed payment 
schedule for which a yield to maturity can be easily determined acquired on 
or after January 1, 2014. 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities may be adjusted for amortization, 
accretion, original issue discount adjustments, or principal paydowns. The 
calculation is based upon the taxpayer election, type of fixed 
income security, and certain attributes, obtained from sources believed to 
be reliable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there 
may be a temporary incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until 
the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These calculations 
will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those involving 
foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with less 
than one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and 
you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax returns.

Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your 
investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a 
money market mutual fund. Shares of a money 
market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your 
brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds credited 
to your brokerage account. Please see the 
money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's 
disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional information. 
Please be advised that Reich & Tang Asset Management, LLC will be 
liquidating its funds (the "R&T Funds") by the end of July 2015 and as such 
the R&T Funds will no longer be available as money market 
funds in the DBSI cash sweep program (the "Sweep Program"). 
What this means for you: 
If you are currently invested in an R&T Fund, please refer to our earlier 
letter for more information about your available cash sweep options, or 
contact your client advisor. 
If you are not currently invested in the R&T Funds, this change will not 
affect the existing sweep for your uninvested cash balances and no action is 
required on your part. 
For information on all cash sweep options available in the Sweep Program, 
please visit our website at: http://wealth.deutscheawm.com/americas/en/-
