owned by me or HBRK Associates, Inc. or any entity owned by Darren K. Indyke, shall continue 
to be so employed or to so provide such services for a period of two (2) years following the date 
of my death; provided, however, that the Trustees shall have the right terminate the employment 
or the engagement of any such employees or service providers if and at such times as the Trustees 
determine in their discretion that there is cause for such termination. For purposes of this Section

or cessation of the need for employment or services, or any other circumstances causing the 
Trustees to determine in their discretion that there is cause for such termination. The obligation 
of the Trustees to ensure such continued employment or provision of services shall include, 
without limitation, payment out of the assets of the Trust Estate for the costs and expenses of all 
items of compensation, remuneration and benefits as shall then be in effect at the then current
