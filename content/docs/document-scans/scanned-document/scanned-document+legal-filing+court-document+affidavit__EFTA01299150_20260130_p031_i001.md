Kimble v. D. J. McDuffy, Inc., 623 F.2d 1060, 1067 (5th Cir. 1980) (rehearing en banc 
pending). 
12. The Court excludes the Sherman Act court contained in the Amended Complaint which alleges an anticompetitive 
conspiracy on the part of the defendants. If plaintiff sustains these allegations with proof, a remedy is already provided for by 
that law. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 158, 26. 
r26] For these reasons, plaintiff's § 1985 claim cannot be sustained. 
(c) § 1986 allegations 
[FIN14) No claim for relief will lie under 42 U.S.C. § 1986 13until a valid claim has been 
established under § 1985. Hamilton v. Chaffin, 506 F.2d 904 (5th Cir. 1975); Zentgraf v. 
Texas A & M University, 492 F. Supp. 265 (S.D.Tex.1980); Shore v. Howard, 414 F. Supp. 
379 (N.D.Tex.1976). Plaintiff having established no § 1985 claim, the § 1986 claim must 
also be dismissed. 
13. This section extends liability in damages to those persons "who, having knowledge that any of the wrongs conspired to be 
done, and mentioned in section 1985 ... are about to be committed, and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the 
commission of the same. (neglect or refuse) so to do...." 
(d) Summary 
Whether plaintiff couches his claims for relief under the rubric of due process, equal 
protection or the civil rights laws, the Amended Complaint alleging violations of plaintiffs 
civil rights must be dismissed for failure to state a claim r271 upon which relief can be 
granted. 
V. CONCLUSION 
After a thorough review of the applicable law, the Court concludes that plaintiff has no 
cognizable claim under either 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985 or 1986. The Court further 
concludes that it would be premature to dismiss the Amended Complaint as to the 
Sherman Act claim without permitting plaintiff an opportunity to conduct limited discovery 
and respond to the objections raised by the defendants, should they elect to renew them. 
Accordingly, it is 
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the defendants' joint motion to dismiss is GRANTED in 
part and DENIED in part as follows:
