I whisper to Harrison 
mai 
[Ford], "That looks just like 
ohnny Depp." Harrison rolls mil 
his eyes and reluctantly 
introduces me to his 
friend . . . Johnny Depp. 
I he Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness Queen 
Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of The King's 
speech and is "moved" by the film. With no proof the Queen 
has actually seen the film, press agents send out a global press 
release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. 
FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24 
Mid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel. As the house-
keepers unpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge 
and find Warren Beatty in a booth. I tell him I'm rooting for 
his wife, Annette Benning, and love her film, The Kids Are All 
Right. Warren says The Social Network will win. 
This year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I 
am shown to a very, very small room—the size of a broom 
closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am 
moved. The housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes 
flying. The hotel is sold out, so I get someone else's room. 
Another unsuspecting victim checking in downstairs will get 
the broom closet. 
It is cold, grey and rainy. Taffeta, organdy and embroidered 
silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters 
and fur coat, and head to Arianna Huffington's home in 
Beverly Hills where she and Wendi Murdoch arc hosting a 
party for Tom Freston's wife, the beautiful, blonde Kathy. 
Her book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change 
the World—perfect for monks. 
Arianna has just sold the Huffington Post to AOL for $315 
million dollars and is rumored to have personally landed 
around 520 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole 
Kidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other drenched power 
players include Disney's Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay, Fox's 
Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter 
Chloe Malle, Google's Eric Schmidt, Oliver Stone escorting 
his daughter Tara and avoiding questions about Charlie 
Sheen, Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, CBS's 
Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount's Brad 
Grey and fiance Cassandra Huysentruyt and Jeff Bezos. 
Hors d'oeuvres include pigs in blankets—a food group not 
mentioned in Kathy's book. 
The action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus' home for a party 
for True Grit's Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on 
the way in and he says, "Keep me on your list." Is he kidding? 
Sunrise and Mark Buffalo, Focus Feature's James Shamus, 
Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie 
Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up 
with Justin Bieber. She giggles, "Peg, I am only le 
I am face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him 
I love him in Morning Glory. He's looking at me in utter 
disbelief, but I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is inches away 
in a hat and glasses. I whisper to Harrison, "That looks just 
like Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly 
introduces me to his friend ... Johnny Depp. I babble a bit 
about his great work then run for cover in a corner next to my 
buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer. 
I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd's "Friday Night 
Party." 'Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam 
that makes it impossible to get near the house. The world's 
most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a 
run for it. Bryan Lourd and Bruce Boni receive friends at the 
door all night. 
Inside, Uma Thurman tells me she finally moved into a 
doorman building in New York after being terrorized by 
stalkers for years. Ben Walker talks about Abraham Lincoln; 
Vampire Hunter, which he is about to shoot, while his fiancé, 
Mamie Gummer, looks sexy shivering in a white satin gown. 
Producer Jon Kilik mentions he oversaw a new cut of Julian 
Schnabel's Mind, to be released in March. Bennett Miller, 
standing with Kristin Gore, says Sony loves his new film, 
Moneybag and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not 
terrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an actual job 
decorating Jeffrey Katzenberg's home. I congratulate Barry 
Levinson's son Sam, a director, for winning the writing 
award at Sundance for his first film, Another Happy Day. 
Also seen floating around arc Taylor Swift and Jake 
Gyllenhaal—but not together—Sean Penn, Tom Cruise and 
Katie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa, 
Paul Haggis, Marisa Tomei, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore 
and Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard Butler, Renee 
Zellweger with Bradley Cooper, &wiled director Alejandro 
Gonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boat,-
' 
(who is headed to Broadway in The Normal Heart this 
spring) and CAA's Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda 
Queally. Sony Classic's Michael Barker tells me The Social 
Network will win. 
Tired celebs try to go home, but limo lock is at a standstill. 
Cell phones don't work in the area. Two hundred swells 
become party prisoners and happily hang out till 5 a.m. 
SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26 
Out comes the sun and dries up all the rain. 1AC chair-
men and owner of NewstveekIThe Daily Beast Barry Diller 
and his wife Diane Von Furstenberg (with her kids Alex 
and Tatiana) host their 15th annual lunch for Graydon 
Carter in their Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces 
me to his star guest, Gov. Jerry Brown, just elected to his 
third (nonconsecutive) term as California governor. 
Like last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected 
on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic tables sit 
on oriental rugs covering the soggy ground. VIPs wears 
winter clothes, comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive 
in a fur coat.
