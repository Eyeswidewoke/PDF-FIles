17.6 
All inspections, maintenance, modifications, repairs, and overhauls of the Aircraft 
(including those performed on the Airframe, the Engines or any components, 
appliances, accessories, instruments, or equipment) shall be performed by 
personnel authorized by the FAA to perform such services. 
17.7 if any Engine, component, appliance, accessory, instrument, equipment or part of 
the Aircraft shall reach such a condition as to require overhaul, repair or 
replacement, for any cause whatever, in order to comply with the standards for 
maintenance and other provisions set forth in this Agreement, Grantor may: 
(a) 
Install on or in the Aircraft such items of substantially the same 
type in temporary replacement of those then installed on the Aircraft, pending overhaul or repair 
of the unsatisfactory item; provided, however, that such replacement items must be in such a 
condition as to be permissible for use upon the Aircraft in accordance with the standards for 
maintenance and other provisions set forth in this Agreement; provided further, however, that 
Grantor at all times must retain unencumbered title to any and all items temporarily removed; or 
(b) 
Install on or in the Aircraft such items of substantially the same 
type and value in permanent replacement of those then installed on the Aircraft; provided, 
however, that such replacement items must be in such condition as to be permissible for use 
upon the Aircraft in accordance with the standards for maintenance and other provisions set forth 
in this Agreement; provided further, however, that in the event Grantor shall be required or 
permitted to install upon the Airframe or any Engine, components, appliances, accessories, 
instruments, engines, equipment or parts in permanent replacement of those then installed on the 
Airframe or such Engine, Grantor may do so provided that, in addition to any other requirements 
of this Agreement: 
Lender is not divested of its security interest in and lien 
upon any item removed from the Aircraft and that no such removed item shall be or become 
subject to the lien or claim of any person, unless and until such item is replaced by an item of the 
type and condition required by this Agreement, title to which, upon its being installed or attached 
to the Airframe, is validly vested in Grantor, free and clear of all liens and claims, of every kind 
or nature, of all persons other than Lender; 
(ii) 
Grantor's title to every substituted item shall immediately 
be and become subject to the security interests and liens of Lender and each of the provisions of 
this Agreement, and each such item shall remain so encumbered and so subject unless it is, in 
turn, replaced by a substitute item in the manner permitted in this Agreement; 
(iii) If an item is removed from the Aircraft and replaced in 
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, and if the substituted item satisfies the 
requirements of this Agreement, including the terms and conditions above, then the item which 
is removed shall thereupon be free and clear of the security interests and liens of Lender; and
