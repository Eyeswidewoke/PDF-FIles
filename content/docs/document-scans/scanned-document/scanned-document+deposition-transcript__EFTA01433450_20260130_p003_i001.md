and Affirmation of Hypothecation Agreement and Certain Documents Referred to 
Therein" [the "first Extension Agreement"] in which they reaffirmed the 
Amended 1999 Note in its entirety, the Hypothecation Agreement, and each 
document and term thereunder. (Id. Ex. E.) Each of these documents—the 
original 1999 Note, the 1999 hypothecation agreement, the Amended 1999 Note, 
and the first Extension Agreement—contains clauses stating that New York law 
would govern the "construction, validity, and performance" of the 1999 Note 
and the Amended 1999 Note. (Id. Ex. A at 8-9; Ex. B at 7-8; Ex. D at 10; Ex. 
E at 2-3.) 
Sometime in the spring of 2001, Epstein and FTC discovered that the AIG 
Investment was "suddenly and rapidly deteriorating." (Pls.' Mem. Of Law in 
Opp'n to Mot. To Dismiss, Epstein Decl. ¶ 20.) According to the plaintiffs, 
FTC's advisors contacted Davison and other employees of Citibank, and 
requested Citibank's help in coordinating the replacement of the AIG fund's 
manager. (Id. ¶ 21; Schantz Decl. ¶ 5.) In May 2001, Davison informed the 
plaintiffs that, in order to remove AIG as the fund manager, FTC would need 
sixty-six and two-thirds percent (662/3%) of the votes of income note 
holders. Because the plaintiffs did not know the identities or respective 
percentages of ownership of the other income note holders, they requested 
that Davison provide them with that information. The plaintiffs claim that 
Davison initially assured them that she would provide such information 
promptly, but later informed them that she was having difficulty obtaining 
the information from SSB, and recommended that they seek the information 
from Chase Manhattan, the Trustee of the fund. (Pls.' Mem. Of Law in Opp'n 
to Mot. To Dismiss, Schantz Decl. ¶¶ 6-8. ) Chase Manhattan, however, 
referred the plaintiffs back to Citigroup. In June, the plaintiffs learned 
for the first time that AIG itself owned twenty-eight percent (28%) of the 
income notes of the AIG investment. Thus, plaintiffs would not need other 
income note holders with as much of an investment in the income notes as 
they originally had believed because AIG's interest would not count toward 
any vote to remove it as manager. In July 2001, the plaintiffs finally 
received the information they had requested from Citibank. (Id. ¶¶ 9-10.) 
At this time, Davison and SSB representatives urged the plaintiffs not to 
attempt to seek to remove AIG as the fund manager. In August 2001, FTC's 
attorney arranged a telephone conference with representatives from Citibank 
and SSB. Plaintiffs contend that during this conference they learned for the 
first time that Citibank could not assist them in seeking to remove AIG 
because SSB had an investment banking relationship with AIG that might be 
adversely affected by such an action. (Id. at ¶¶ 11-13.) 
On June 11, 2002, the plaintiffs filed their complaint in this Court. One 
month later on July 11, 2002, Citibank sued the plaintiffs in the Southern 
District of New York, alleging that they had defaulted on both the loan at 
issue here and a second $10 million loan.1 See Citibank, N.A. v. Epstein, 
Index No. 02-CV-5332-SHS (S.D.N.Y.2002). On November 27, 2002, I issued an 
order restraining Citibank and Citigroup from pursuing their New York 
lawsuit pending decisions on these motions. Financial Trust Co., Inc. v. 
Citibank, N.A., Order, Civ. No.2002-108 (D.V.I. Nov. 27, 2002). In light of 
subsequent events, however, I sua sponte vacated this prohibition. Financial
