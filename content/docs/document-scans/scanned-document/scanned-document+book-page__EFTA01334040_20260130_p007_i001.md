contains a parody of Affleck and Matt Da-
mon making Good Will Hunting II. Affleck 
says to Damon, "What do f keep telling you? 
You gotta do the safe picture, then you do 
the art picture. Then sometimes you gotta 
do the payback picture because your friend 
says you owe him. Then sometimes you got-
ta go back to the well." 
"Sometimes you do Reindeer Games," 
Damon says derisively. 
"That's just mean," Affleck whines. 
But it's a pretty accurate description of 
his area to date. "Ben takes these franchise 
properties so he can go and experiment," 
says Haney Weinstein. 
'He believes in trying to stretch himself 
and notlkeep doing the same thing," ob-
sena Bruce Willis, who started with Affleck 
in Armageddon. -He's an awesome actor, 
and I think he's going to do great things." 
Several years ago, in a televised interview 
on Inside the Actors Studio. Affleck said that 
his goal was to make big commercial movies. 
He has since revised his ambitions. "That's 
an adolescent aspiration, in a way. I'd 
rather be in movies like Magnolia, which I 
think is a towering achievement. Ill con-
tinue to act, but I won't act in a way that 
requires me to hang my name out there 
and do a lot of publicity. I'll do character 
roles and focus on writing and directing. It 
doesn't require the same kinds of sacri-
Ike, in terms of quality of life and person-
al life. and it's a more holistic approach to 
the process. It's become increasingly this-
[rating for me to have my role in the story-
telling process limited to one character. You 
hate to be respectful and judicious about 
your input when it's somebody else's project." 
Affleck has always impressed colleagues 
with his voracious appetite for information 
and skills. "He has made it a point to learn 
everything he can about how the business 
works—not just the craft of acting, but 
from the producing standpoint, from the 
studio standpoint." says Jon Gordon, exec-
utive vice president of production at Mira-
mar. "He knows how deals work. ft's what 
sets him apart. If he wanted to run a studio 
at some point, he could. He's about as 
sharp as they come." 
A
file& is already juggling his acting with 
screenwriting and such other commit-
ments as Project Greenlight. the contest he 
and Damon started to help launch the ca-
reen of young filmmakers. Aftleck's friends 
are certain hell be directing soon. "There's 
no question," Weinstein says. "Both he and 
Matt. I think they're going to rewrite the 
rules. These guys can fix anything. There'll 
be home runs in both instances:* 
But there are other thoughts tickling the 
back of Affleck's mind as well. A passion-
ate liberal. he campaigned for Al Gore. 
cares deeply about evlitval issues and is 
extremely well informed. He entertains him-
self by writing imaginary. political speeches 
in his head. He would rather discuss AIDS 
in Africa than his movie career. 
When Lopez goes to Afflecles mother's 
house for dinner. aeinstein reports. "J.Lo 
told me that the conversation at the table is 
always about politics—about government 
initiatives, educational initiatives. what's go-
ing an in the day." 
So. is Affleck planning to N,.. 
.,nne the lib-
erals answer to Ronald Frown' Ile admits
that he entertains the thought of someday
running kr Congress, alma: 
think there's 
a real nobility to public service. It would be 
fun to run on a platform I really hci: 
in, without any of the kind of comprou 
people make—without being beholden 
• 
the win-at-all-costs mentality." 
And the invasion of privacy would 
nothing new. "What are you going to sac 
about me that hasn't already been said? I 
don't cheat, I don't drink. I don't do drugs. 
I live a clean fife," Affleck says, his eyes 
twinkling. 
"He's only 30 years old," says Jennifer 
Todd, who on-produced Roder Room. "He 
gill has an enormous amount of time to 
do things." 
Time. and drive. 1 think he's incredibly 
hungry," says Sean Bailey. who founded 
the media and production company Live-
Planet with Affleck. Damon, and Chris 
Moore. "I think the guy has very grand 
aspirations. I don't think he's going to be 
content with just being a movie star. He 
knows he has the potential to do very big 
things." 
Such ambitions could he derailed by am 
number of miscalculations. including a ph-
tate life that generates too many sensational 
headlines, but Aftleck has a clear idea of 
the ultimate goal. "On my deathbed. I have 
to be one who looks back and feels I lived 
a good and substantial and meaningful 
lik:' he says. 
In the meantime. howe.a. there's a wed-
ding to plan. 
Jeffrey Epstein 
co‘rtst to room nor los Bear Stearns 
and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear 
Steams on March 12. The S.E.C. was tipped 
otT that Epstein had information on insider 
trading at Bear Steams. and it was theatre 
obliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testi-
mony, given on April I. 1981, Epstein claimed 
that he had kund "offensive" the way Bear 
Stearns management had handled a disci-
plumy action following its discovery that he 
had committed a possible "Reg D" viola-
tion—evidently he had lent mann to his clos-
est friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said 
that he'd lent approximately S20.000 to War-
ren Eisenskin. to buy stock.) Such an action 
could have been considered improper. al-
though Epstein claimed he had not realized 
this until afterward. 
According to Epstein. Bear Steams man-
agement had questioned him about the loan 
around March 4. The questioners. Epstein 
said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and 
molten 2003 
SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE 
Alvin Einbentler.ln his 1989 deposition Ep-
stein recalled that the partner who had made 
an "issue" of the matter was Marvin David-
son. On March 9. Epstein said. he had met 
with Tarnow/ and Einbender again, and the 
two punnets told hint that the menthe com-
mittee had weighed the offense. together with 
previous "carelessness- over expenses. and 
he would be fined 52.500. 
"There was discussion whether. in fact. I 
had ever put in an airline ticket for some-
one else and not myself and I said that it 
was possible. ... since my secretary han-
dles my expenses." Epstein told the S.E.C. 
In his 1989 testimony he stated that the 
"Reg D" incident had cost him a shot at 
partnership that year. 
What the S.E.C. seemed to be especially 
interested in was whether there was a con-
nection between Epstein's leaving and the 
alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals 
by other people at Bear Stearns: 
Q: Sic are you aware that certain rumors may 
have been circulating around your flint in con-
ORDER 
nettion with your reasom for leaving the firm? 
A: I'm aware that there were many rumors. 
Q: What were the rumors you hard? 
A: Nothing to do with St. Joe. 
Q: Can you relate %chat you heard? 
A: It was having to do with an illka affair 
with a secretary. 
Q: Have you heard any other rumors suggest-
ing that you had made a presentation or com-
munication to the Executive Committee con-
caning alleged improprieties by other mem-
bers or employees of Bear Stearns? 
A: I. in fact, have heard that =we but ifs been 
from Mr. Harris in our comersation last week. 
Q: Have you heard it from armane else? 
A: No. 
A little later the interview focuses on 
James Cayne: 
Ct: Did you ever hear while you were at Bear 
Stearns that Mr. Cayne may have trader or it • 
sider information in connection with Si ' • 
Minerals Corporation? 
A: No. 
Q: Did Mr. Cayne ner have any comenation 
with you about St. Joe Minerals? 
A: No.
