[1] Criminal Law C=1023(3)

Grand jury proceeding is not a "civil action" for 
purposes of statute permitting interlocutory appeals 
in civil actions with respect to controlling questions 
of law. 28 U.S.C.A. § 1292(b). 
[2] Criminal Law C=1023(3) 
110k1023(3) 
Persons whose state grand jury testimony had been 
subpoenaed by federal grand jury could appeal the 
denial of their motions to quash the subpoenas to 
the extent that they asserted a privilege as to the 
material, but could not raise issues of procedural 
violations or federal-state comity on appeal. 
[3) Criminal Law C:=I023(3) 
110k1023(3) 
When party has been subpoenaed to testify or 
produce records for grand jury and third-party 
merely fears that privileged material may be 
disclosed along with other, nonprivileged material, 
Page 1 
the case is not ripe for appellate review until the 
subpoenaed patty has actually been asked to reveal 
specific material covered by the assertive privilege. 
[4) Grand Jury C=36.9(2) 
193k36.9(2.) 
Federal common-law presumption of grand jury 
secrecy cannot be asserted in the form of a privilege 
by those seeking to prevent disclosure to a federal 
grand jury ef their state grand jury testimony.
