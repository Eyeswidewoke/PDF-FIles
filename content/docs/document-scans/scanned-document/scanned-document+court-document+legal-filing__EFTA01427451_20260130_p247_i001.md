Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is or are signed by 
the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number 
of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a 
meeting at which all shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon were 
present 
and voted, unless our amended and restated certificate of incorporation 
provides otherwise. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation 
will preclude stockholder action by written consent at any time when our 
Sponsor, the Bishop Family Partnership and their affiliates beneficially 
own, in the aggregate, less than 40% in voting power of the stock of the 
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. 
Supermajority Provisions 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and 
restated bylaws will provide that the Board of Directors is 
expressly authorized to make, alter, amend, change, add to, rescind or 
repeal, in whole or in part, our bylaws without a stockholder vote in any 
matter not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware and our 
amended and restated certificate of incorporation. For as long as our 
Sponsor, the Bishop Family Partnership and their affiliates beneficially 
own, in the aggregate, at least 40% in voting power of the stock of the 
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, any 
amendment, alteration, rescission or repeal of our bylaws by our stockholders 
will require the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the 
outstanding shares of our stock present in person or represented by proxy at 
the meeting of stockholders and entitled to vote on such amendment, 
alteration, rescission or repeal. At any time when our Sponsor, the Bishop 
Family Partnership and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, 
less than 40% in voting power of all outstanding shares of the stock of the 
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, any 
amendment, alteration, rescission or repeal of our bylaws by our stockholders 
will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in 
voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Company 
entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. 
The DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the 
outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, voting together as 
a single class, is required to amend a corporation's certificate of 
incorporation, unless the certificate of incorporation requires a greater 
percentage. 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that at 
any time when our Sponsor, the Bishop Family Partnership and 
their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 40% in voting 
power of the stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the 
election of directors, the following provisions in our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or 
rescinded only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in 
voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Company 
entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class:
