driving a taxi cab to working as a mechanic. Any notion that he was born with a "silver 
spoon in his mouth" should be dismissed. 
Although Mr. Epstein is self-made and worked long and hard, he could not have 
achieved his successes without the personal guidance and support of others. These key 
people first identified the promise in Mr. Epstein and brought him to Bear Stearns and 
Company, Inc. There, starting in 1976 at the age of 23 as a floor trader's junior assistant, 
he became in 1980 a limited partner. Among the very many benefits that his experience 
there provided was an introduction to the people who ultimately became his clients. 
Early in his professional career, Mr. Epstein realized the profound impact that 
even one person can have on the life of another. His gratitude for the assistance he 
personally received, and his sense of obligation to provide similar assistance and 
guidance to others, is in large part, the motive for the primacy of philanthropy in his life 
or his particular philanthropic interests. Mr. Epstein has devoted a substantial portion of 
his time, efforts and financial resources to helping others, both on an individual basis and 
on a more far reaching scope. Mr. Epstein gives generously, of both his time and his 
financial resources equally to individuals whom he knows personally and well and to 
those with whom he has had little or no personal contact. Just a few examples: 
Some time ago, the two year old son of an employee was diagnosed with retinal 
blastoma. When told, Mr. Epstein not only gave the employee unlimited time off to 
attend to his son and promised whatever financial support was needed, but Mr. Epstein 
made the full list of his medical and research contacts available. The employee was put 
in contact with a former colleague who was then conducting eye research at Washington 
University. Mt Epstein organized several meetings to determine how the colleague could 
be of assistance, including by arranging for further meetings with experts at Washington 
University. Though the employee's son lost one eye, he is now an otherwise normal 
twelve year old who attends private school along with his five siblings, the expenses of 
which are borne by Mr. Epstein. 
Several years ago, a new employee with whom Mr. Epstein had little or no prior 
contact approached Mr. Epstein to request a change in his medical insurance. It was soon 
revealed that the employee and his wife were experiencing fertility problems and they 
were seeking treatments that cost nearly $15,000 per month. Mr. Epstein insisted on 
paying directly for the treatments, and did so month after month. After each 
unsuccessful cycle, Mr. Epstein sat with the employee, exploring available alternatives, 
including adoption, and encouraging the employee to continue additional cycles at Mr. 
Epstein's. Mr. Epstein referred the employee to medical experts with whom Mr. Epstein
