RE: 
LRN shares (K 12 Inc). RD and I contacted transfer age=t and now RD is working with KUE outside counsel to get shares 
quantities =onfirmed and re-issued if necessary. The transfer agent records do not mat=h the amount we should have 
received (nor is the name on file the holder of record (LBF Holdings)) and transfer=agent has not received insruction to 
deliver to broker. Once we get =uantity and other transfer agent issues cleared up, we will mpve to broker=and sell. RD 
is contacting outside counsel again today for follow up 
I rec'd the last of 3 IT outsource proposals yesterday= Second meetings with all concluded last week and EA/ ID 
included in=second meeting. I will summarize differences and take one firm out o= running (cost 3x). Plan was to 
discuss internally today/ tomorrow for final selection. Cost — 10% cheaper than current=provider with same/ improved 
coverage. 
Foundation has been funded with appreciated stocks and=these positions have been liquidated. There are 1648 shares 
of Unite= Rentals that are restricted. RD is sending paperwork to LOB to sign today=to clean these shares up. Once the 
paperwork is provided to broker and they release the restriction (move the shares to=type 2 account) then transfer to 
Foundation will begin. There are a =ouple of loss positions worth < $3K that need to be sold. RD is to prov=de shares 
and ticker to EA today so that clearance/ compliance apporval can begin. I'd like to have the accou=ting group be 
invilved in this to gain familiarity with the Apollo complia=ce process. There is a worthless position that JPM will 
purcha=e for $1 to take off their books (Scienta is the name of the company - no longer on pink sheets or OTC BB) RD 
has pap=rwork for this for LDB to sign today. 
401k - call with specialist yesterday with EA/RJ. = To not have Julie be part of 401k, the thought is to begin plan Dec=1. 
Compensation would be one month and any employer contribution wou=d be minimal given any contribution would be 
for rank and file on one month comp. Given that highly compensated is de=ined by prior year compensation, RJ and RD 
are not highly comped in 2013 a=d will help cure any low participation by rank and file for 2014 plan year= (Plan year is 
calender year) Top heavy rules should not be applicable given that FU and EA are only key employees=and AC/RD are 
not, ie the key employee contributions will not exceed 60% o= total plan contributions a/o 12/31/2014. For 2015, the 
=01k specialist is running numbers based on our census to see if we will have any issue either on the discrimination 
rules=or the top heavy rules. Specialist indicated that matching can be ma=e only for non-highly compensated and not 
fr highly compensation, For 2015= HG will not be highly compensated apparently as her stub comp is less than $115K. 
The more non-highly comped that=participate, the better. 401k specialist is running some scenarios a=d costs under 
different matiching scenarios and will revert tomorrow (Tues=ay is Ambrose holiday) 
Art list has been provided to LDB. Gating questi=n is what is cost benefit of retaining more than 2x collateral - step up 
b=nefit of art retained in estate vs lesser value of art partnership leavingran unpaid note in hands of APO1 (with a zero 
basis), ie capital gain by trust at death. This was the gist =f the meeting with LDB /HG/RJ late Oct. HG has confirmed we
