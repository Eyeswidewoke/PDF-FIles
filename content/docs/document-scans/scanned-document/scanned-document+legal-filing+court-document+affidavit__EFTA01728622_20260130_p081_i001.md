■ intent - it can be useful in proving that an offender's activity with a child 
or collection of visual images of children was for sexual gratification. It can 
be part of the context used to evaluate child pornography (i.e., shed.light 
on the distinction between innocent nudity and lascivious exhibition of 
the genitals). 
■ bond - it can be used at a bond hearing to help indicate the nature of the 
subject's sexual fantasies and interests and his potential dangerousness. 
■ guilty plea - the seizure and documentation of such material negates many 
common defenses and increases the likelihood of a guilty plea. 
■ sentencing - even if not admissible at trial, it can be introduced at the 
time of sentencing to demonstrate the full scope of the defendant's behav-
ior and interests. 
Child erotica must be evaluated in the context in which it is found. Although 
many people might have some similar items in their home, it is only the pedo-
phile who collects such material for sexual purposes as part of his seduction of 
and fantasies about children. Many people have a mail-order catalog in their home, 
but only a pedophile has albums full of children's underwear ads he clipped and 
saved from past catalogs. 
The law-enforcement investigator must use good judgment and common 
sense. Possession of an album filled with pictures of the suspect's own fully dressed 
children probably has no significance. Possession of 15 albums filled with pie-
hires of fully dressed children unrelated to the suspect probably has significance. 
Possession of his own children's underwear in their dresser probably is normal. 
Possession of a suitcase full of little girls' underwear probably is suspicious. Pos-
session of a few books about child development or sex education on a bookshelf 
probably has no significance. Possession of dozens of such books together in a 
box probably is significant. 
Possession of numerous books, magazines, articles, or newspaper clippings 
about the sexual development and abuse of children or about pedophilia in 
general can be used as evidence of intent at a subsequent trial. It is difficult to 
disprove the claim of a wrestling coach that his touching was legitimate athletic 
training or the claim of a teacher that his or her touching was normal, healthy 
affection. This difficult task can be made easier if law enforcement has seized a 
child-erotica collection that includes items such as a diary or fantasy writ-
ings describing the sexual stimulation experienced when touching a child 
to demonstrate a wrestling hold or fondling a student.

Determining Age 
Proving that the person in a sexually explicit image is a child or minor can some-
times be difficult. With young, clearly prepubescent victims, the trier of fact can 
make the determination based simply on looking at the images. Pediatricians or 
pediatric endocrinologists can be brought in as experts to evaluate the sexual 
development of the persons portrayed in the visual images. Such doctors cannot 
determine a precise age, but can testify to the probability that the person por-
trayed is younger than a certain age. Although they can use something called the
