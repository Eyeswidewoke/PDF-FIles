My darling, 
What a surprise and how generous of you, Thank you very much indeed for this 
generous Xmas present which as you can easily imagine comes in more than handy! 
I was so pleased to hear that you had a quite and happy birthday cum Xmas day in 
Palm Beach. As you are always crossing the world in all directions, I am certain 
that just being quietly at home is quite a change! Unlike most people who try to 
escape the humdrum of their lives and only dream to "get away". 
I had a very happy Xmas stay at Patrick's with Vonnic, two of his children, 
Daniel and Adam as Roland and her father, a very distinguished an cultured 
gentleman. 
We arrived at 1pm and sat for Xmas lunch at 3pm, starting with 
smoked salmon and a truly delicious fresh foie gras procured by Vonnic and washed 
with a Mombazillac I had offered from my cellar. Then Vickiu and cooked a truly 
excellent capon stuffed like a turkey. it was tender and melted in your mouth 
adn the farce, teh roasted potateoes and teh chesthuts were very good as usual 
and that dish was accompanied with a St Emilion wine also given my me out of the 
cellar. 
Then we had a break during which time presents were distributed and Vonnic and I 
enjoyed ourselves on a very fiendish puzzle. then a cup of tea appeared and we 
sat down again by then it was 8 O'clock when we ate the Xmas pudding which Oping 
at made for us on my order and which I had carted all the way from London and 
brandy butter done by Vicky and fresh cream, then it was followed by some really 
first class French cheeses and a totally out of the world Coulomiers. Then there 
was some fruits and goodies . I was absolutely full having done nothing else but 
eating all day. But the atmosphere was good in his beautiful drawing room a 
former grange transformed magnificently by Patrick. he bought himself a grand 
piano and plays very well indeed so we continued doing the puzzle with the sound 
of 
'Chopin studies' in the background. We finally left for home at midnight! 
I received phone calls from all the children except from Kevin who must have been 
so very busy as they had Xmas with the entire horde of the Warnford Davis which 
should be enough for anyone to lose their heads! 
Now, we got up late and having had a good lunch I am looking forward to a whole 
afternoon of quiet at my computer, answering messages and sending some. 
I'll be back home on 30th January. 
Thank you again for all your kindness to me and with all my love.
