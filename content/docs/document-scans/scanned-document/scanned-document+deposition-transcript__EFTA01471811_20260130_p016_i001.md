that the non-Defaulting Party elects to treat the price so quoted (or, 
where more than one price is so quoted, the arithmetic mean of the prices so

in the case of Deliverable Securities, such Transaction Costs, as the 
Default Market Value of the relevant Equivalent Securities or Equivalent

states -
that either (x) acting in good faith, the non-Defaulting Party has 
endeavoured but been unable to sell or purchase Securities in accordance 
with subparagraph (i)(A) above or to obtain quotations in accordance with 
subparagraph (i)(B) above (or both) or (y) the non-Defaulting Party has 
determined that it would not be commercially reasonable to obtain such 
quotations, or that it would not be commercially reasonable to use any 
quotations which it has obtained under subparagraph (i)(B) above; and 
that the non-Defaulting Party has determined the Net Value of the relevant 
Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities (which shall be 
specified) and that the non-Defaulting Party elects to treat such Net Value 
as the Default Market Value of the relevant Equivalent Securities or 
Equivalent Margin Securities, 
then the Default Market Value of the relevant Equivalent Securities or 
Equivalent Margin Securities shall be an amount equal to the Default Market 
Value specified in accordance with (A), (B)(cc) or, as the case may be, (C)-
(bb) above. 
If by the Default Valuation Time the non-Defaulting Party has not given a 
Default Valuation Notice, the Default Market Value of the relevant 
Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities shall be an amount 
equal to their Net Value at the Default Valuation Time; provided that, if at 
the Default Valuation Time the non-Defaulting Party reasonably determines 
that, owing to circumstances affecting the market in the Equivalent 
Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities in question, it is not possible 
for the non-Defaulting Party to determine a Net Value of such Equivalent 
Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities which is commercially reasonable, 
the Default Market Value of such Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin 
Securities shall be an amount equal to their Net Value as determined by the 
non-Defaulting Party as soon as reasonably practicable after the Default 
Valuation Time. 
The Defaulting Party shall be liable to the non-Defaulting Party for the 
amount of all reasonable legal and other professional expenses incurred by 
the non-Defaulting Party in connection with or as a consequence of an Event 
of Default, together with interest thereon at LIBOR or, in the case of an 
expense attributable to a particular Transaction, the Pricing Rate for the 
relevant Transaction if that Pricing Rate is greater than LIBOR.

Transaction, require Seller from time to time to pay Cash Margin at least 
equal to such Transaction Exposure;
