Backdoor witch hunts - James Studdard 
- Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, the Democrats' new wonder boy, has laid out a heavenly plan 
for all those left-wing zealots, who want to master Republican bashing. Here's how the Super Duper 
(Dupe for the Democrats) Prosecutor does it. 
First, he finds some fishy (not necessarily illegal) goings on in, or about, the Bush White House. The 
fishiest piece of political shenanigans extant is the outing of Valerie Name as a covert agent for the 
C.I.A. Super boy calls a hasty meeting of his staff, and as quickly as you can say, "indictment," Lewis 
"Scooter" Libby is charged. 
It matters not that any couch potato, who, even with inadvertent channel surfing, would have bumped 
into Hannity, O'Reilly or Greta and known that it was Richard Armitage and not Libby who outed 
Plame. 
All right, having established the way the hunt began, we now have to understand the underlying motive 
for the hunt. Joe Wilson, Plame's husband, was undermining the president by discrediting the White 
House's claim that Saddam Hussein was purchasing weapons-grade material from Niger. So naturally, 
when Plame was outed, a hue and cry went up from the usual Democrats that Libby was a Bush agent 
seeking revenge for Wilson's criticism of the president. 
They claimed Libby had compromised national security and almost got Wilson's wife bumped off. "It's 
outrageous", they bawled. "Why, it's treasonous," they yelped. "I'll drink to that," mumbled Teddy 
Kennedy. Libby was subsequently found guilty of obstruction of justice, and perjury. 
Now this story begs the question, "Why wasn't Richard Armitage indicted?" The answer, of course, is 
that an Armitage indictment would have been antithetical to ginning up political hay for the Dems. 
Understand this: There was no crime committed. Valerie Plame was not a covert agent. But did that 
deter Fitzgerald? N0000000! His plan was to subpoena as many high-level Bush operatives as he could; 
bring them before a grand jury; shine the big interrogation light on them; question them ad nauseum and 
hope for a slip of the lip. Such was the case with Libby. He was indicted for simply having a bad 
memory. 
My heroine, Ann Coulter, reminded me that the Democrats enjoy relatively safe haven from this sort of 
prosecution. Remember that infamous nocturnal swim of Ted Kennedy's that left a young woman about 
eight liquid feet below the Chappaquiddick bridge. The explanation given by the eldest, living son of 
Massachusetts' First Family of Bootlegging, was that some dastardly Republican switched the road 
signs at Martha's Vineyard. Case closed. No prosecution. 
Then, a nephew of the Massachusetts dream family, Patrick Kennedy, got all liquored and pilled up, hit 
a few cars and ran up a telephone pole. Young Pat, (after crashing into things in a drug-induced stupor) 
was given no sobriety test (though he was staggering) and, in fact, was escorted home. Yep, Pat summed 
it all up when he stopped at the door of the Hawk and Dove watering hole, and slurred, "By God, it's 
great to be a Kennedy!" Entered rehab. No prosecution. 
Jeffrey Epstein, fat cat, and frequent visitor to the Clinton soirees, got all caught up in a Palm Beach 
sting targeting Johns, who hired underage school girls for sex. The prosecutor in this Clintonesque sex 
scandal, Barry E. Krischer, obtained as many as five video-taped interviews with young girls and dozens 
of signed affidavits, which named Epstein as the procurer. Epstein got a lecture on morals and a few 
hours in play-like jail. 
The same prosecutor, Barry E. Krishcher, dogged Rush Limbaugh for three years for allegedly abusing 
prescription medication for back pain. Finally, out of frustration and fatigue, Limbaugh entered a no-
contest plea (no conviction.)
