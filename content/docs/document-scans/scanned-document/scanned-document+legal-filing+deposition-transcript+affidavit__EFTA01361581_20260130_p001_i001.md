The Talented Mr. Epstein; Lately, Jeffrey Epstein's high-ying style has been drawing oohs 
and aahs: the bachelor nancier lives in New York's largest private residence, claims to 
take only billionaires as clients, and ies celebrities including Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey 
on his Boeing 727. But pierce his air of mystery and the picture changes. VICKY WARD 
explores Epstein's investment career, his ties to retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his 
complicated past Vanity Fair March 2003 
was this character we never got a handle on. Again we presumed that he was involved 
with the Pan Am and Emery run that Hoffenberg made, but we never got a chance to 
depose him." 
"From the government's discovery in the main sentencing against Hoffenberg it would 
seem the government was perhaps a bit lazy," says David Lewis, who represented Mitchell 
Brater. "They went for what they knew they could get ... and that was the fraudulent 
promissory notes (i.e., the much larger and unrelated part of Hoffenberg's fraud, based in 
New York State)... What they couldn't get, they didn't bother with." 
Another lawyer involved in the criminal prosecution of Hoffenberg says, "In a criminal 
investigation like that, when there is a guilty plea, to be quick and dirty about it, discovery 
is always incomplete... They don't have to line up witnesses; they don't have to learn every 
fact that might come out on cross-examination." 
Epstein was involved with Hoffenberg in other questionable transactions. Financial records 
show that in 1988 Epstein invested $1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc., a company that 
manufactures football helmets. Among his co-investors were the theater mogul Robert 
Nederlander and attorney Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this transaction claims that 
Epstein told Nederlander and Toboroff that he had raised his share of the money from a 
Swiss banker, whose identity they could not be allowed to know. But Hoffenberg has 
claimed the money came from him, and Towers's financial statements for that year show a 
loan to Epstein of $400,000. (Epstein has said he can't remember the details and has 
disputed the accuracy of the Towers financial reports.) 
Around the same time, Nederlander and Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a 
scheme to make money out of Pennwalt, a Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan was 
to group together with two other parties to take a substantial declared position in the stock. 
According to a source, Epstein was supposed to help Nederlander and Toboroff raise $15 
million. He seemed to fail to find other investors, say those familiar with the deal. (Epstein 
has said he was merely an investor.) He invested $1 million, which he told his co-investors 
was his own money. But in his 1989 deposition he said that he put in only $300,000 of his 
own money. Where did the rest come from? Hoffenberg has said it came from him, in a 
loan that Nederlander and Toboroff didn't know about. 
Two things happened that alarmed Nederlander and Toboroff. After the group signaled a 
possible takeover, the Pennwalt management threatened to sue the would-be raiders. 
Epstein was reluctant initially to give a deposition about his share of the money, telling 
Toboroff there were "reasons" he didn't want to. Then, after the opportunity for new 
investors was closed, co-investors recall Epstein announcing that he'd found one at last: 
Dick Snyder, then C.E.O. of the publisher Simon & Schuster, who wanted to put up 
approximately $500,000. (Neither Epstein nor Snyder can now recall the investment. Yet in 
the 1989 deposition Epstein said that he had recruited Snyder, whom he had met socially, 
into the deal.)
