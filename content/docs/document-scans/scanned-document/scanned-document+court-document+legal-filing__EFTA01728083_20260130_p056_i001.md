THE PRINCE'S FOUNDATION 
DIRECTORS' REPORT (Continued) 
We believe that if we can understand and apply time tested principles and therefore build in a 
sustainable way again, we will reap improvements in public health, in livelier and safer streets, and in a 
more affordable lifestyle for families and individuals. We also believe that neighbourhoods exhibiting 
these sustainable characteristics will increase, rather than decrease, in value over time. 
Through exemplar projects, an academic programme, and policy and research initiatives, we aim to 
influence the future development of the built environment by affecting the business strategies and long 
term planning of major developers, government departments and academic institutions. We believe 
that close scrutiny of traditional models for architecture and town planning is a sound basis for 
addressing the sustainability agenda.
