financial assistance. We will provide you with a list of dentists and 
physicians in your destination, assist with travel arrangements if you 
need to get home in a hurry and help replace lost medication. We will 
also wire you emergency cash, point out the nearest ATM, and even 
explain the visa requirements before you go.

Think All Car Insurance Rates Are the Same? They're Not! 
Maybe last year your car insurance premium went up. But this year 
perhaps it didn't go up as much--or at all. No increase...so no point 
shopping around...all insurance companies' rates are the same 
anyway. The American Express Property Casualty companies could 
still save you money. In fact, we beat our competitors' prices 52% of 
the time.*

countrywide average during a two-year period ending 9/30/04. Property Casualty insurance
