3. mathe=atics is the search for truth. algorithms that do not ch=nge there result with the passing of the day. . 
mathematics st=nds outside of time. the ideal of a point or line ( separte from ein=teins measuemrnt issues as the 
actaul measurement is much more diffcult =AO. requiring a beggining and and end therefore measurement lives i= time 
space. mathematics is the search for truth. =C2 I postualte that Biology and biological systems differ from 
mathemat=cs beacuse it is needs deception to survive. biological systems only make =ense in time space. , trying to 
stay away from what is the mom=nt of life or death. . predator prey. biuoog=cal systems need free energy in order to 
maintain structure dissinte=raing from entropy, eneygy needs to be ingested inorder =o fight the slope down to 
breaking apart and returning to dust. =AO . getting energy, the most basic bio requiremen=. in bio systems however 
the best way to get energy is either =rom the sun, a limtied chenical reaction or heat gradisent. the ener=y must come 
from outside. the way for systems to gain enery is=to eat it. the way not to die is to eat andnot be eaten.. the game =f 
eat or not be eaten is very sophisticated what is the =ntity . the cell. the organ , the organism . the community =AO 
on and on. heirarchila nested systems. at=every level decision have to be made , is it ok to sacrifice a few c=lls so that 
the organism can live. which cells. darthey get a choice? how many when . when the organism is =aten by its 
predator. how did it try to protect itself. =amaflouge, surrounding itself in junk, mimicryy, misdirection, 
misin=ormation. etc.. qurum sensing game theory, free wi=1, bait, ants, . 
4 we have come a long way in sur=eillance and detecting and encoding and decoding communticaions betw=en people 
between computers, . we can do this beacuse we can p=ck out the words in text, embed it in a grammar space, 
=AOwe know the language/ 
we need to do the same now=for biology, what is the language of the cells. do they 
=ommuncat with proteins, . what are they saying to each other, is teh=oanaguage encrypted , does each person have 
his onw code. =AO is it chemcial or elctrical or both. or physical like=the shape of the protein fiiting in a lolck, or 
combination of all three.=C2 the protein fits. the electri is fired, etc. does the brain send a m=ssage. what does 
medicine do. does it fool the receiver =he sender. the listener. the history of telemommincaiotns inte=cepts have a 
long histroy referring to alice and bob that would like=to speak to each other, they encript their messages. =AO so that 
a listener cannot do damge. . why not artack the bio language the same way as speech. 
have=nsa work on 
decrypting the differnce in signals from a cancer =ell as opposed to a helathy one. we know that cells send out 
messages =AO, am i in the right place. if they get no answer or t=e wrong aswer they are programeed to commit 
suicicde. when a f=reigner shows up in a neighborhhod that is hostile , he is sur=ounded. killed and moved into the 
trash. he can ma=querade as a local. how can the other cells tell. =an they ask him who won the world series. ? . 
maybe an equival=nt. friend or foe, ? decoding skills find it difficutl t= decipher if there is no repitition or action that is 
the result of =he message. the famous example separate from heil hitler=at teh end of the message ( anecdote or true 
). to break a cod= that was recieved from the germans the allies planed a bomb in thre= citie all set to blow at teh 
same time, they thoguth that the=word for bank or bomb would be in the message for the day.. or so t=e story goes. 
money what =s it . is it a mirage that disappears when you look too closely, =A0 can you have money without debt, is 
it an accounting =ystem. what and whys of itnerest. was it for small=communities. ? with the same currency, what is 
the dirrency beteen c=rency and money, what is the meaing of value,? cos=. market. what is a derivative, futures , 
stocks bonds, =ptions, converitibles. how does trust fit in, can you h=ve money with no trust. in each other in an 
institutuion, =AO, what is credit, is it different than money,  social contract.=C2 reputation. economics. . currency 
exhange, bitcoin= zero knowledge proof. , 
intellignce. ? =speed of thought . algorithmms empathy, creativity, surivial.=. is it a limited resource 
distributions, =AO pwer laws. biollogical agents. networks. is gravity m=rely a restoring force. . pareto . zipf, normal. 
why are=things distributed. central limit therom randomness. =AO etfc.
