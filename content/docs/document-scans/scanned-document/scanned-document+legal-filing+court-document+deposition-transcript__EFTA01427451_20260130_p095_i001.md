Table of Contents 
Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing 
stockholders in the public market following this offering could cause the 
market price for our common stock to decline. 
The sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public 
market, or the perception that such sales could occur, 
including sales by our Sponsor, could harm the prevailing market price of 
shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these 
sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity 
securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 
Upon completion of this offering we will have a total of 
shares sold or issued in this offering (or 
shares of our common stock outstanding. Of the outstanding shares, the 
shares if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option to purchase 
additional shares) will be 
freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, except that any 
shares held 
by our affiliates, as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities 
Act, may be sold only in compliance with the limitations described in 
"Shares Eligible for Future Sale." 
The remaining outstanding 
shares of common stock held by our existing owners after this offering will 
be subject to certain 
restrictions on resale. We, our executive officers, directors and all our 
existing stockholders, including the selling stockholders, will sign lock-up 
agreements with the underwriters that will, subject to certain customary 
exceptions, restrict the sale of the shares of our common stock and certain 
other securities held by them for 180 days following the date of this 
prospectus. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 
may, in their sole discretion and at any time without notice, release all or 
any portion of the shares or securities subject to any such lock-up 
agreements. See "Underwriting" for a description of these lock-up agreements. 
Upon the expiration of the lock-up agreements described above, all of such 
shares (or 
shares if the underwriters exercise 
their over-allotment option to purchase additional shares in full) will be 
eligible for resale in a public market, subject, in the case of shares held 
by 
our affiliates, to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 
144. We expect that our Sponsor will be considered an affiliate 180 days 
after this offering based on their expected share ownership (consisting of 
our stockholders may also be considered affiliates at that time. 
We intend to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the 
Securities Act to register shares of our common stock or 
securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock 
issued pursuant to the 2015 Plan. Any such Form S-8 registration 
statements will automatically become effective upon filing. Accordingly, 
shares registered under such registration statements will be available for 
sale in the open market. We expect that the initial registration statement
