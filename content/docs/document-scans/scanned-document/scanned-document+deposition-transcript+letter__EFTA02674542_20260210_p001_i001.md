DEAR FRIEND 
After doing=a "last review/edit" of my Weekend Reading an= sending it to friends, being a political news junkie, I start 
the week with the Sunday Morning major networks news programs, Face the Nation hosted =y Bob Schieffer/CBS, Meet 
the Press hosted by David Gregory/NBC and The Week with Ge=rge Stephanopoulos/ABC. Since in LA they all 
concurre=tly broadcast at 8am, I record them along with Chris Matthew' half-hour weekend new= show on NBC for later 
viewing. In addition to their round table panels of usual suspects including, George Will, Newt Gindrich,=Mathew Dowd, 
Chuck Todd, Kelly O'Donald, Bob Woodward, Andrea Mitchell, Dan Rather, David Ignatius, Peggy Noonan, Cokie 
=oberts, David Brooks, Sam Donaldson, Fareed Zakaria, E.J. Dionne, Jr., Robert Reich= David Gergen, Peggy Noonan, 
John Dickerson, and Norah O'Donnell, this week&rs=uo;s special guests included Senator Lindsey Graham on CBS, 
Senator John McCain on NB= and Representative Mike Rogers on ABC, to allow them to 'Monday Mo=ning Quarterback' 
the past week's political events and decisions. The problem with all of these shows, it that they are often use to settle 
scores and advance ideological positions, with sound bites being presented as solutions, pro and con, just in case one is 
correct. And=because great humor is often based on a foundation of truth, what President Obama s=id at the Press 
Dinner last Saturday is true for the Sunday news programs &nbs=;— "... I know CNN has taken some knocks l=tely, but 
the fact is I admire their commitment to cover all sides of a story, ju=t in case one of them happens to be accurate." 
House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., said this morning on This Week that "some a=tion needs 
to be taken" against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons, saying that the red =ine "can't be a dotted line." Sen. 
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Sunday on Face the Nation that "=here's a growing consensus in the U.S. Senate that the 
United States should get involved." "If we keep this hands-off approach to Syria, this indecisive action towards Syria, 
kind of =ot knowing what we're going to do next, we're going to have war with I=an because Iran's going to take our 
inaction in Syria as meaning we're not ser=ous about their nuclear weapons program," he said. "We need to=get 
involved." And on Meet the Press, Senator John= McCain auguring that the United States should be arming the rebels, 
using airstrikes to att=ck Assad's forces and create a safe haven for refugees. What all o= this really means, no one 
knows, because as we know from Viet Nam, Iraq and Afghanistan, without clearly def=ned goals, strong partners and 
total international support, the aftermath will =ost likely end up as a disaster. The first rule in drinking, "if you don't 
know sip slow", an= in international diplomacy, "when you don't know move slow." The President is right to dial back 
the "red line", especially when n=ne of his options are good and there is no clear long-term goals or strong local 
partners. Leaving Afghanistan in the hands of Karzai and Iraq with Chalabi, Allawi and Maliki has proven to be a 
disaster, and in Syria it could be eve= worse. 
A=though I applaud John McCain as a patriot, he is totally out of touch with reality. This is=a person who believes that 
the Surge In Iraq was a success, when in reality is was a temporary band-aid that for a time, overwhelming several 
violent f=ctions while paying off others, but doing nothing to address the underlying core p=oblems and dysfunctionality 
in the country. I believe that Lindsey Graham is right when he says t=at Syria looks like it is going to end up a failed
