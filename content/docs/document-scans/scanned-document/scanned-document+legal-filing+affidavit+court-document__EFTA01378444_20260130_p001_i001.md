fiduciary discourse-the impact of corporate plans on multiple stakeholders' interests. Under 
a multi-fiduciary regime, workers and consumers would be entitled to such corporate 
speech, just as shareholders are entitled to it now. In this section, I examine the possibility 
of using prescriptive discourse norms as a means of institutionalizing multiple-stakeholder 
corporate governance. 
Fiduciary discourse is not an end in itself; it is a mechanism through which "trust" can 
be developed and managed. Trust is valua r213J ble in the corporate context because it 
can serve as a highly efficient solution to the "agency problem" that corporate stakeholders 
face when turning control of firm resources over to the board of directors. '44 While we may 
reserve the highest forms of trust for our most intimate associations, it is very clear that 
trust does not require "thick" relationships. 
Trust is an important component in our 
personal, professional, and consumer lives. '4" To greater or lesser degrees, we may trust 
that individuals within an organization or institution will "take our interests into account 
when determining what course of action to pursue." '61
Before corporate stakeholders can trust a firm's board of directors, however, the board 
must behave in a trustworthy fashion. The difficulty of obtaining trustworthy conduct by 
boards is, again, the fundamental problem that corporate law scholars have traditionally 
assessed from the shareholder perspective. An important part of the solution that 
corporate law uses to engender this fidelity involves the imposition of discourse norms on 
board operations. That is, one of the ways that corporate law gets directors to behave in a 
trustworthy fashion is by requiring directors to engage in speech acts expressing and 
analyzing the interests they are charged with pursuing. n'e This mechanism can also be 
deployed to deepen directors' ties to multiple stakeholders. The active expression of 
commitment introduces a crucial psychological dynamic. Human beings are deeply 
motivated to see themselves, and to be seen by others, as consistent and coherent across 
different behavioral and decision-making contexts. 
Expressions of commitment can thus 
lay the tracks for future conduct that will be consistent with the commitment, as we are 
loath to view ourselves as hypocritical or contradictory. n*. Social psychologists have ['2141] 
shown that articulating a particular perspective can change the underlying attitude of the 
person speaking even where the speech act is in the first instance prescribed by a "role" 
rather than the private, subjective feelings or thoughts. m's This relationship between 
speech, commitment, and behavior happens automatically in our subconscious cognitive 
processing. ^c.' 
In addition to being motivated to view ourselves as consistent and coherent, we human 
beings are also motivated to be viewed positively by the groups with which we associate 
ourselves. ”" Corporate law also harnesses this fundamental psychological drive to help 
spur trustworthy behavior by corporate directors. A corporate board is a collegial body that 
can induce the desire for group affirmation in the hearts and minds of its members. Again, 
the director's obligation to speak her commitments stokes this powerful commitment 
mechanism. When a director promises to attend to the interests of multiple stakeholders 
before a group of other directors, who are making the same promise, she will tend to keep 
her commitment more consistently than if she just says it to herself, or thinks it to herself. 
The director knows that others will be watching and will hold her accountable if she 
malingers or cheats-by shunning her, refusing to support her reappointment the board, or 
refusing to invite her to serve on other corporate or civic boards with which they are
