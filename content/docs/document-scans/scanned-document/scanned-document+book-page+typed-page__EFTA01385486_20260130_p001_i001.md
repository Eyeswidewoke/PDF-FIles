international operations where the residential satellite speeds are even more 
competitive). The majority of the subscriber bases at rural telcos, such as 
Windstream. Qwest (CTL), and Frontier, take speeds at 50 Mbps or below. 
While those capabilities are improving over time, the launch of Jupiter-3 and 
ViaSat-3 in the beginning of the next decade is going to provide the satellite 
industry with a big opportunity to expand its tangible addressable market with 
both constellations able to offer speeds in excess of 100 Mbps. The issue that 
still weighs heavily in the favor of DSL providers is one of cost. We still think 
DSL will price itself at a cost level that will provide some insurance policy 
against a wholesale loss of customers. We do think, though, that there is a 
market in the embedded base of DSL subscribers where some would gladly 
pay more for higher levels of throughput. 
On the enterprise-facing side of the business, providers are in the process of 
changing the landscape and opportunities as the major players have launched 
the next gen High Throughput Satellites (HTS). In Network Services, while the 
new capabilities provide many new benefits such as added capacity and new 
addressable end markets, the earliest impact of the advanced technology was 
significant pressure on pricing that the industry experienced throughout 2016 
and early 2017. As we've progressed through the year, commentary from 
management teams have acknowledged pricing has stabilized in the last 6 
months or so. With legacy services declining due to the proliferation of fiber in 
certain geographies coupled with pricing pressure, the offsetting growth has 
had to come from mobility, enterprise, cell backhaul, etc, but the pick-up in 
those services is slow in aggregate. Mobility picked up quickly considering it's 
the only game in town. 
Speaking directly on Intelsat, management has spoken of a longer-than 
expected sales lead cycle of selling the new HIS capacity into customers. 
Currently, this appears to be taking on the form of "when" not "if" as we 
continue to expect that the industrial logic of the industry upgrading its 
capacity makes inherent sense. We believe this will prove to be one of the 
situations where carriers such as Intelsat will need to help develop the 
customer solution set and then sell those end services into customers and 
drive revenue. While this implies that we do not expect a "line out the door" to 
sign up for this new capacity, we are still convinced that the ramp in revenue 
will come, but that there is still work to do by Intelsat and others to help 
develop the solutions sets that customers will then buy to address future 
business needs. 
Spectrum Monetization?: Following an NOI from the FCC in August 2017, 
which asked the question of how to free up valuable C-band spectrum (3.7-4.2 
GHz), Intelsat responded proactively with a proposal alongside Intel that would 
allow the satellite industry (90% of C-band is owned by Intelsat and SES) to sell 
swaths of frequencies to the mobile industry as we get closer to the arrival of 
5G technology in the next few years. If we study the industry responses to 
Intelsat and Intel's joint proposal, overall the wide majority of ex parte filers are 
overwhelmingly supportive of freeing up spectrum in this band. 
Where 
differences lie is in how that plan would be implemented, whether the FCC 
needs to be involved and how quickly this plan could be brought to reality. We 
expect the FCC (this is a rather broad and uninformed guess) to provide 
feedback to Intelsat and Intel's proposals as well as the industry's ex parte 
filings in late 1Q18 or early 2Q18. At that point, the process could potentially 
take on many forms, including an accelerated path under which Intelsat and 
Intel could start forming a consortium to start a private clearing and sales 
process or a more public NPRM process that look to have the FCC involved in 
something that more closely resembles a public auction. Undoubtedly there 
are also lots of other options in between. Important in our mind, though, is the 
notion that the FCC very much wants to free up spectrum in this band (ideally 
suited for many future 5G applications), the wireless industry very much wants
