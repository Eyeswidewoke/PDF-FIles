HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
(d) If a distribution is made in kind, immediately prior to such 
distribution, the General Partner shall determine the fair market value of the property 
distributed and adjust the Capital Accounts of all Partners upwards or downwards to 
reflect the difference between the book value and the fair market value thereof, as if such 
gain or loss had been recognized upon an actual sale of such property and allocated 
pursuant to Sec. 3.05. Each such distribution shall reduce the Capital Account of the 
distributee Partner by the fair market value thereof. 
(e) The provisions of this Sec. 5.05 shall apply to distributions made in 
connection with any withdrawal under Article V and in connection with dissolution 
pursuant to Article VI, unless otherwise provided for in Article VI. 
(0 (i) The General Partner may withhold and pay over to the Internal 
Revenue Service (or any other relevant taxing authority) such amounts as the Partnership 
is required to withhold or pay over, pursuant to the Code or any other applicable law, on 
account of a Partner's distributive share of the Partnership's items of gross income, 
income, gain or gross sale or disposition proceeds. 
(ii) 
For purposes of this Agreement, the amount of any taxes so 
withheld or paid over by the Partnership, and any other Investor-Related Taxes borne by 
the Partnership, with respect to a Partner's distributive share of the Partnership's gross 
income, income, gain or gross sale or disposition proceeds shall be deemed to be a 
distribution or payment to such Partner, reducing the amount otherwise distributable to 
such Partner pursuant to this Agreement and reducing, without duplication, the Capital 
Account of such Partner. 
If the amount of such taxes is greater than any such 
distributable amounts, then such Partner and any successor to such Partner's Interest shall 
pay the amount of such excess to the Partnership, as a contribution to the capital of the 
Partnership. If the Partnership becomes subject to any Investor-Related Tax or other tax 
(including interest, penalties and additions to tax) relating to amounts previously 
distributed to a Partner that has subsequently withdrawn from the Partnership, such 
withdrawn Partner shall promptly contribute such amount to the Partnership following 
receipt of notice thereof from the Partnership. 
(iii) 
The General Partner shall not be obligated to apply for or 
obtain a reduction of or exemption from withholding tax on behalf of any Partner that 
may be eligible for such reduction or exemption. To the extent that a Partner claims to be 
entitled to a reduced rate of, or exemption from, a withholding tax pursuant to an 
applicable income tax treaty, or otherwise, the Partner shall furnish the General Partner 
with such information and forms as such Partner may be required to complete where 
necessary to comply with any and all laws and regulations governing the obligations of 
withholding tax agents. Each Partner represents and warrants that any such information 
and forms furnished by such Partner shall be true and accurate and agrees to indemnify 
the Partnership and cach of the Partners from any and all damages, costs and expenses 
resulting from the filing of inaccurate or incomplete information or forms relating to such 
withholding taxes.
