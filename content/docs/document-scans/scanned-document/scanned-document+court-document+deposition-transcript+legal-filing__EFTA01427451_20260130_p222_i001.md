Performance Compensation Awards. The Compensation Committee may also 
designate any award as a "performance compensation 
award" intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 
162(m) of the Code. The Compensation Committee also has the 
authority to make an award of a cash bonus to any participant and designate 
such award as a performance compensation award under our 2015 
Plan. The Compensation Committee has sole discretion to select the length of 
any applicable performance periods, the types of performance 
compensation awards to be issued, the applicable performance criteria and 
performance goals, and the kinds and/or levels of performance goals that 
are to apply. The performance criteria that will be used to establish the 
performance goals may be based on the attainment of specific levels of our 
performance (and/or one or more affiliates, divisions or operational and/or 
business units, product lines, brands, business segments, administrative 
departments, or any combination of the foregoing) and are limited to 
specific criteria enumerated in our 2015 Plan.

of any governmental body or securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation
