Fair Value 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. Authoritative guidance for fair 
value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs 
to valuation models based upon the degree to which they are observable. The 
three levels of the fair value measurement hierarchy are as follows: 
Level 1: Inputs represent quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
Level 2: Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) that are 
either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through 
correlation with market data at the measurement date for the duration of the 
instrument's anticipated life. 
Level 3: Inputs are unobservable and therefore reflect management's best 
estimate of the assumptions that market participants would use in 
pricing the asset or liability. 
The Company estimates the fair value of its assets and liabilities, which 
qualify as financial instruments, and includes this additional 
information in the notes to the financial statements when the fair value is 
different from the carrying value of these instruments. The estimated fair 
value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, 
accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue approximate 
their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these 
instruments. The outstanding debt at December 30, 2012 was borrowed in 
conjunction with the 2012 Acquisition. The outstanding debt at December 29, 
2013 was borrowed in conjunction with the August 23, 2013 
refinancing (see Note 7). The outstanding debt at December 28, 2014 was 
borrowed in conjunction with the April 9, 2014 refinancing (see Note 7). 
Because the interest rates are based upon variable interest rates, the fair 
values of the long-term debt at December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 
approximate their carrying values and are categorized as Level 2 in the fair 
value hierarchy. 
Revenue 
Revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products 
are sold and is presented net of employee meals, and 
complimentary meals. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards that do not have 
expiration dates are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of the sale 
and recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed by the holder. The 
portion of gift cards sold which are never redeemed is commonly 
referred to as gift card breakage. The Company recognizes gift card 
"breakage" revenue for gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes 
remote and the Company determines there is no legal obligation to remit the 
value of the unredeemed gift cards to governmental agencies. The 
Company estimates the gift card breakage rate based upon the pattern of 
historical redemptions. Prior to the third quarter of Fiscal 2014, the 
Company did not recognize any breakage revenue because it did not have
