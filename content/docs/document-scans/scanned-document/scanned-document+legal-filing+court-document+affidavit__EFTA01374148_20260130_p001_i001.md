recipient. The Partnership, the General Partner, the Investment Manager and the Administrator make no

its systems as permitted by applicable law. If the New Limited Partner has any doubts about the 
authenticity of an e-mail purportedly sent by the Partnership, the General Partner, the Investment 
Manager or the Administrator, the New Limited Partner is required to contact the purported sender

on the New Limited Partner giving consent to electronic delivery of Partnership Information. The New 
Limited Partner agrees that it will be solely responsible for notifying the Partnership in writing of any 
change in its e-mail address and that the Partnership may not seek to verify or confirm the New Limited 
Partner's e-mail address as provided. If the New Limited Partner does not have access to the intemet or 
e-mail, the New Limited Partner should not consent to electronic delivery of Partnership Information. The 
New Limited Partner may revoke its consent to electronic delivery of Partnership Information at any time 
upon written notice to the Partnership and receive all Partnership Information in paper format. The New 
Limited Partner may also request delivery of a paper copy of any Partnership Information by contacting
