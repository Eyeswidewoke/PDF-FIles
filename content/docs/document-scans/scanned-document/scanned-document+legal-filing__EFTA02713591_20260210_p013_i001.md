contributed for the benefit of the Partnership, to reflect that the capital will be deemed 
contributed as of the beginning of the applicable Fiscal Period. 
3.6 
Other Separate Memorandum Accounts. 
(a) 
The General Partner may in its sole discretion determine that based 
upon tax or regulatory reasons or any other reason as to which the General Partner and a Partner 
agree, such Partner should not participate in the net capital appreciation or net capital 
depreciation, if any, attributable to trading in any security, or type of security or to any other 
transaction, and may allocate such net capital appreciation and net capital depreciation only to 
the Capital Accounts of the Partners to whom such reasons do not apply. In addition, if for any 
of the reasons described above, the General Partner determines that a Partner should have no 
interest whatsoever in a particular security, type of security or transaction, the General Partner 
may set forth the interests in any such security in a separate memorandum account and the net 
capital appreciation and net capital depreciation for each such memorandum account shall be 
separately calculated. In such event, the General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to 
make an equitable adjustment to Partners not participating in the separate memorandum account. 
(b) 
The General Partner, in its sole discretion, shall have the authority 
to cause the Partnership to directly or indirectly participate in offerings of "new issues" (i.e., 
certain initial public offerings of equity securities). In the event that any Partner is or may be 
restricted from participating in new issues under the applicable rules of the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") then the Partnership reserves the right to allocate all or some 
of the profits or losses arising from new issues trades away from such restricted Partner to the 
extent deemed appropriate by the General Partner. In such event, the General Partner shall be 
authorized, but not required, to make an equitable adjustment to account for the fact that non-
restricted Partners were receiving profits or losses based in part on the capital of restricted 
Partners. Such adjustment may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner and to the extent not 
prohibited by rules of FINRA, consist of (i) assessing an interest charge to the Capital Accounts 
of non-restricted Partners, in favor of the Partnership, in an amount deemed appropriate to 
compensate the Fund for the use of capital by non-restricted Partners in connection with new 
issue trades; (ii) specially allocating a portion of non-new issue results of the Partnership from 
the non-restricted Partners to the restricted Partners; or (iii) such other adjustment as the General 
Partner considers equitable and is not inconsistent with the rules of FINRA.
