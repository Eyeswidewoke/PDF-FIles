We recommend the use of this speaker in a bi-amplified system using high-quality satellite speakers and amplifiers. 
We do not recommend the use of this subwoofer with a passive crossover (coil). as this type of device will adversely 
affect performance.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE 
The diagram above shows the typical 
installation procedure into a fiberglass panel using 
the supplied hardware (Classic Grille Model shown. 
Installation is the same for Sport Grille Models). 
Always follow proper safety procedures when 
working on a vessel. Use eye-protection at all times 
and a dust mask and gloves when cutting. 
I) Choose a flat mounting surface that has 
sufficient depth and air space behind it to accept 
the subwoofer. 
2) Cut a 8875•inch (225 mm) diameter hole 
3) Run the speaker cable to the mounting location. 
4) Place the woofer in the hole and mark the screw 
hole locations using a sharp, pointed tool. 
5) Remove the woofer and drill a plot hole 
(see chart on next page) in each of the screw 
locations. it is also advisable to use a hand-driven 
Countersink tool on each hole to further inhibit 
gel-coat cracking of fiberglass panels. 
6) Connect the speaker wires and place the woofer, 
with its grde in place, into the opening (for Sport 
Grille models, pay attention to where the logo 
badge will added. 
7) While holding the speaker firmly in its mounting 
location, evenly snug the mounting screws in a 
criss-cross pattern, then hand tighten in a criss-
cross pattern. 
Non-standard installations may require different 
hardware. Always use marine-grade, stainless-steel 
fasteners to ensure a secure, reliable installation.
