Exchange Commission? 
A No. 
Despite the circumstances of Epstein's 
laving, Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his 
aunial bonus—which he anticipated as be-
im appnrtimately S100.000. 
The S.E.C. never brought any charges 
against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider 
trading in St. foe. but its questioning seems 
so indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein's 
answers. Some sources have wondered 
why. if he was such a big producer at Bear 
Stearns, he would have given it up over a 
mere $2.500 fine. 
Certainly the years after Epstein let the 
firm were not obviously prosperous ones. 
His luck didn't seem to change until he met 
Reifenberg. 
nne of Epstein's first assignments for Hof-
kiknberg was to mastermind doomed bids 
to take over Pan American %bid Airsays in 
1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. 
HoReobag claimed in a 1993 hearing before 
a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up 
wilt the idea of financing these bids through 
Towers's acquisition of two ailing Illinois 
insurance companies. Associated Lik and 
United Fire. 'He was hired by us to work on 
the securities side o(the insurance companies 
and Towers Financial. supposedly to make a 
profit fee us and for the companies," Ram-
berg reportedly told the grand jury. He also 
cBstein was the "technician." a-

coning the schemes, although, having no 
broker's license, he had to rely on others to 
make the trades. Much of Hoffenberts sub-
sequent testimony in his criminal case has 
proven to be false. and Epstein has claimed 
he was merely asked how the bids could be 
accomplished and has said he had nothing 
to do with the financing of them. Yee Rich-
ard Allen, the former treasurer of United 
Fire. recalls seeing Epstein two or three 
times at the company. He and another ex-
ecutive say they had direct dealing with Ep-
stein over the finals= And in his deposition 
of 1988 Epstein stated that he was the one 
who executed "all" Hoffenbag's instructions 
to buy and sell the stock. He called it "mak-
ing the orders." He could not recall whether 
he had chosen the brokers used. 
To win apprise' from the Illinois insur-
ance regulators for Towers's acquisition of 
the companies. HoiTenberg promised to in-
ject 53 million of new capital into them. In 
fact. in his grand jury testimony Hoffenberg 
claimed that he. his chief operating officer. 
Mitchell Brame and Epstein came up with a 
scheme to steal 53 million of the insurance 
companies' bonds to buy Pan Am and Em-
ery stock. "Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Stater 
arranged the various brokerage accounts acv 
the bonds to be placed with in Nen' York. 
and I think one in Chicago. Rodman & Rev 
Holfenberg reportedly said. Then. 
said Hoffenberg, while making it appear as 
though they were investing the bonds in 
much safer financial instruments. they used 
them as collateral to buy the stock. "Ep-
stein was the person in charge of the trans-
actions. and Mitchell Rimer was assisting 
him with it in coordination, an behalf of the 
insurance companies' money." Ho:limbers 
claimed at the time. 
At one point. according to Hottinserg. 
broker forged the documents necessary for a 
41.8 million check to be written on insurance-
company funds. The check was used to buy-
mom stock in the takeover targets. Mean-
while. in order to throw the insurance regula-
tors off the SI.S million was reported as being 
safely invested in a money-market account. 
United Finis eater chief financial officer 
Daniel Payton confirms pan of Hotrenberg's 
account. He says he recalls making one or 
two telephone calls to Epstein (at Moffat-
bag's direction) about the missing bonds. 
"He said, 'Oh. yeah. they still exist.' BUT we 
found out bier that he had sold those assets 
... leveraged them ... (and) used seine mar-
gin account to take some positions in ... 
Emery and Pan Am: says Payton. 
Epstein's caraordinary creativity was, ac-
cording to Hoffenberg, responsible for the 
purchase by the insurance companies of a 
5500.000 bond. with no money down. "Ep-
stein created a great scheme to purchase a 
5500.000 treasury bond that would not be 
shown • • • last Ittleygllilltgor collateralized. 
r psalm was involved with Reifenberg in 
.11La other questionable transactions. Finan-
cial records show that in 1988 Epstein in-
vested S1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc.. a 
company that manufactures football helmets. 
Among his co.investors were the theater 
mogul Robert Nederlander and attorney 
Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this 
transaction claims that Epstein told Neder-
lander and Toboroff t

his 
share.? Rik

he reportedly told the grand jury. "It looked 
like it was free and clear but it actually 
wasn't," he said. 
Epstein has denied he ever had any deal-
ings with anyone from the insurance com-
panies. But Richard Allen says he recalls 
talking to Epstein at Holfenberg's direction 
and telling him it was urgent they retrieve 
the missing bonds for a state examination. 
According to Allen, Epstein said, "NWT get 
them back." He had 'kind of a flippant atti-
tude," says Allen. "They never came back." 
E
pstein. according to Hoffenberg, also 
tame up with a scheme to manipulate 
the price of Emery Freight stock in an at-
tempt to minimize the losses that occurred 
when Hoffenberes bid went wrong and the 
share price began to fall. This was alleged to 
have imbed multiple clients' accounts con-
trolled by Epstein. 
Eventually, in 1991, insurance regulators in 
Illinois sued Reifenberg. He settled the case, 
and Epstein. who was only a paid consul-
tant. was never deposed or accused of any 
wrongdoing. Barry Gross. the attorney who 
was handhng' the suit for the regulators. says 
of Epstein. "He was very elusive.... It was 
hard to really track him down. There were a 
substantial number of checks for significant 
dollars that were paid to hint. I remem-
ber.... He was this character we never got a 
handle on. Again we presumed that he was 
imehed with the Pan Am and Emery run 
that Hoilenberg made. but we never pat a 
chance to depose him: 
-From the government's discovery in the 
main sentencing against Reifenberg it "cold 
seem the pavernment was perhaps a bit lazy: 
says David Lewis. who represented Mitchell 
Brace. "They went for what they knew they 
could get ... and that was the fraudulent 
promissory notes (i.e., the much larger and 
unrelated part of Hof enberg's fraud, based 
in New York Statet.... What they couldn't 
get. they didn't bother with" 
Another lawyer involved in the criminal 
prosecution of Reifenberg says. "in a crim-
inal investigation like that. when there is a 
guilty plea. to be quick and dirty about it. 
discovery is always incomplete... . They 
don't have to line up witnesses; they don't 
have to learn every fact that might tome out 
on cross•examination"
