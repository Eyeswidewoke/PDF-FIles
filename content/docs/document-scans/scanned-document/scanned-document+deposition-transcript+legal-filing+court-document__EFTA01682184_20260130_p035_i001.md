Bear Stearns' Collateral Damage 
Page 2 of 3 
comment. Epstein, once described by New York magazine as an "international money man of mystery," 
reportedly won't take on any clients who aren't billionaires. One of Epstein's longtime clients is Leslie Wexner 
the billionaire founder and CEO of the Limited Brands (LTD) retail chain. 
BIG LOSERS 
Even beyond his money-management business, Epstein has cut a high-profile figure. Over the years, he has 
befriended powerful politicians, celebrities, and academics, including former President Bill Clinton, Cloak 
Trump and law professor Alan Dershowitz. 
Epstein isn't the only supposedly savvy money manager to the super-rich to throw money into the Bear Steams 
funds. A so-called hedge fund-of-funds managed by Paris-based BNP Paribas (BNP4Y) also is listed on an SEC 
filing as a beneficial owner of the same beleaguered Bear Stearns fund in which Epstein invested. A BNP 
spokeswoman declined to comment. A person familiar with BNP's Ozcar Multi-Strategy fund, which invests in a 
variety of different hedge funds, says the problems at Bear Stearns should have minimal impact on Ozcars 
performance. 
Still, this isn't the first time the BNP fund has made a disastrous bet on a hedge fund. The Ozcar fund, and other 
affiliated BNP funds, invested about $49 million in Wood River Partners, a onetime $127 million hedge fund that 
went bust in October, 2005, amid allegations of fraudulent trading. On May 30, John Whittier, the former 
manager of the hedge fund, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to charges of carrying out a scheme to 
defraud investors in the fund. The Ozcar fund, of which little is publicly known, is looking at having invested in 
two big losers in its brief four-year existence. 
TAINTED REPUTATION? 
The hedge fund that Epstein and BNP invested in is barely holding on after using billions in borrowed money to 
buy risky bonds backed by ailing subprime mortgages. The fund was down 23% for the year as of the end of 
April. Bear Stearns says it will provide a full accounting for the funds' losses sometime next week. In June, Bear 
Stearns suspended investor redemptions. Some frustrated investors are offering to sell their shares in the 
beleaguered hedge fund for as little as 10 cents on the dollar in the secondary market. Other investors are 
contemplating litigation. The Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, has launched a preliminary 
investigation into the events leading up to the collapse of the fund (see BusinessWeek.com, 6/25/07, " Bear's Big 
Loss Attracts SEC Atteritign:).
r. 
A sister fund also run by Bear Stearns is faring a bit better, but that's only because the big Wall Street firm has 
opted to prop up that entity with $1.6 billion in loans (see BusinessWeek.com, 6/22/07, "Bear Stearnsicalle 
Rescue—Sort Of'). The four-year-old Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Leverage fund was 
down about 10% as of the end of April. Bear Stearns has suspended investor redemptions in that fund, too. The 
Wall Street firm, however, has decided not to provide any financing to the younger fund, which was more heavily 
leveraged and indebted. 
The near-collapse of the two Bear Stearns funds has sparked widespread concern on Wall Street because both 
hedge funds used billions in borrowed money to buy sophisticated securities called collateralized debt 
obligations. Popularly known as CDOs, these bond-like securities are hard-to-value investments that rarely 
trade. There is fear that the mass liquidation of the CDOs still held by the two hedge funds could cause a 
widespread devaluation in CDO prices. The trouble with the two hedge funds has already forced a management 
shakeup at Bear Stearns' asset management division and ultimately may end up sullying its reputation.
