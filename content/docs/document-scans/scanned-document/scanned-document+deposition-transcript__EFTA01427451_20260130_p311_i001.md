Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs provided that LIBOR 
shall not be lower than 1.80%. The applicable margin for borrowings 
under the term loan is 2.75% with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 1.75% with 
respect to base-rate borrowings. At December 31, 2013 and 
December 31, 2814, the interest rate on the term loan was 4.00% and 3.75%, 
respectively. 
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per 
annum equal to an applicable margin based upon a leverage-based pricing 
grid, plus, at our option, either (i) a base rate determined by reference to 
the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the prime rate of 
Citibank, N.A., (c) the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the cost of 
funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted 
for certain additional costs, plus 1.00% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined by 
reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest 
period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. The 
applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility is 
3.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 2.25% with respect to base-rate 
borrowings. At December 31, 2813 and December 31, 2014, the 
interest rate on the credit facility was 4.25%. 
Interest on term loan borrowings as well as any outstanding borrowings under 
the revolving credit facility is payable quarterly. In addition, we are 
required to pay a commitment fee on any unutilized commitments under the 
revolving credit facility. The initial commitment fee rate is 0.50% per 
annum and varies based upon a leverage-based pricing grid. During 2013, the 
Company incurred total interest expense of $22.9 million, of which 
$2.3 million was capitalized during the period related to the Heartland 
facility build out. During 2014, the Company incurred total interest expense 
of $15.9 million, of which $2.0 million was capitalized during the period 
related to the Heartland facility build out. 
The Amended Facility contains both restrictive operating and financial 
covenants, including a secured leverage ratio (defined as, with certain 
adjustments, the ratio of (i) the Company's indebtedness less unrestricted 
cash and cash equivalents up to $40 million to (ii) consolidated net 
income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) not to exceed 
(a) December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, 4.25:1.00, (b) June 30, 
2015 and September 30, 2015, 4.08:1.00, and (c) if such periods ends on or 
after December 31, 2015, 3.75:1.80. The Amended Facility also sets 
forth mandatory and optional prepayment conditions, including an annual 
excess cash flow requirement, as defined, that may result in our use of 
cash to reduce our debt obligations (effective for the year ended December 
31, 2813). For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, the 
Company was not required to make an excess cash flow payment. As of December 
31, 2014, the Company believes it was in compliance with its 
financial debt covenants. 
Provisions in the Amended Facility currently restrict the ability of our 
operating subsidiary, Blue, from paying dividends to its ultimate parent 
company BBPP, unless Blue meets certain leverage ratio and minimum
