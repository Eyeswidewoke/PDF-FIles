Purchase Price by Buyer against the transfer of such Purchased Securities 
shall be made simultaneously and transfer of Equivalent Securities by Buyer 
and payment of Repurchase Price payable by Seller against the transfer of 
such Equivalent Securities shall be made simultaneously. 
Subject to and without prejudice to the provisions of subparagraph 6(c), 
either party may from time to time in accordance with market practice and in 
recognition of the practical difficulties in arranging simultaneous delivery 
of Securities and money waive in relation to any Transaction its rights 
under this Agreement to receive simultaneous transfer and/or payment 
provided that transfer and/or payment shall, notwithstanding such waiver, be 
made on the same day and provided also that no such waiver in respect of one 
Transaction shall affect or bind it in respect of any other Transaction. 
The parties shall execute and deliver all necessary documents and take all 
necessary steps to procure that all right, title and interest in any 
Purchased Securities, any Equivalent Securities, any Margin Securities and 
any Equivalent Margin Securities shall pass to the party to which transfer 
is being made upon transfer of the same in accordance with this Agreement, 
free from all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances. 
Notwithstanding the use of expressions such as "Repurchase Date", 
"Repurchase Price", "margin", "Net Margin", "Margin Ratio" and 
"substitution", which are used to reflect terminology used in the market for 
transactions of the kind provided for in this Agreement, all right, title 
and interest in and to Securities and money transferred or paid under this 
Agreement shall pass to the transferee upon transfer or payment, the 
obligation of the party receiving Purchased Securities or Margin Securities 
being an obligation to transfer Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin 
Securities. 
Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement. 
Subject to paragraph 10, all amounts in the same currency payable by each 
party to the other under any Transaction or otherwise under this Agreement 
on the same date shall be combined in a single calculation of a net sum 
payable by one party to the other and the obligation to pay that sum shall 
be the only obligation of either party in respect of those amounts. 
Subject to paragraph 10, all Securities of the same issue, denomination, 
currency and series, transferable by each party to the other under any 
Transaction or hereunder on the same date shall be combined in a single 
calculation of a net quantity of Securities transferable by one party to the 
other and the obligation to transfer the net quantity of Securities shall be 
the only obligation of either party in respect of the Securities so 
transferable and receivable. 
If the parties have specified in Annex I hereto that this paragraph 6(j) 
shall apply, each obligation of a party under this Agreement (other than an 
obligation arising under paragraph 10) is subject to the condition precedent 
that none of those events specified in paragraph 10(a) which are identified 
in Annex I hereto for the purposes of this paragraph 6(j) (being events 
which, upon the serving of a Default Notice, would be an Event of Default 
with respect to the other party) shall have occurred and be continuing with 
respect to the other party. 
7.
