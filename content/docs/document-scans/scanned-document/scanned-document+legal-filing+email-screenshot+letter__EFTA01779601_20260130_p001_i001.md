"I've got a story idea for you. The rebuildin= of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been= You will 
never think the same way about anything again." 
=o spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-ol= woman being written up everywhere at the 
moment as the alleged =9Cprocurer" of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
=pstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soli=iting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another 
investigation=0Abecause various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come f=rward with allegations that he 
molested them when they were under-age. T=e allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in=on 
Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tri=d to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece=for Vanity Fair in 2003 called "The Talented Mr. Epstein.=E2 It was largely a business piece that focused 
on his mysterious =xit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne,=Les Wexner, the chairman of 
Limited Brands, and above all, the man who c=aimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently 
serving=a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of=$450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great=friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with =hom 
he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn =99t really go there, focusing instead on the issue that 
remains a myster=—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
=br> This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I =id. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on 
the intrigu=ng financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the=0Asame ones, different ones. 
And their stories are bone-chilling. Journa=ists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to a=k me about 
Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, =ant to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of 
repeating mysel= to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory th=t really brought him into the limelight—that I 
have decided to wri=e about this myself. 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to kno= Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. = kept running 
into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not = social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with 
him who st=nd two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. "Do they speak?=E2 I remember asking him once, nodding 
at his lookalike blondes. H= laughed. "Not like you,Vicky," was his riposte.
