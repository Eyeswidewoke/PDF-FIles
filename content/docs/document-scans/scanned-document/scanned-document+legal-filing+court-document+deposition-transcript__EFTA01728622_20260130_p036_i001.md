like the old stereotype of the child molester in that he is more likely to hang 
around playgrounds and other areas where children congregate, watching or 
engaging them in brief sexual encounters. He may expose himself to children or 
make obscene telephone calls to children. He may utilize the services of a child 
prostitute, travel to a foreign country, or use the Internet to communicate with 
children. Unable to figure out any other way to gain access to a child, he might 
even marry a woman and have his own children, very likely molesting them 
from the time they are infants. He is similar to the inadequate situational-type 
child molester, except that he has more definite deviant sexual preferences, and 
his selection of children as victims is more predictable. His victims could be 
acquaintances, but he is far less likely to be simultaneously involved with 
multiple child victims. 
Sadistic This pattern of behavior characterizes the offender whose sexual prefer-
ences predominately include the need to inflict psychological or physical pain or 
suffering on his victims in order to be aroused or gratified. He is aroused by his 
victim's response to the infliction of pain or suffering. He typically uses lures or 
force to gain access to his victims. He is more likely than other preferential-type 
child molesters to abduct and even murder his victims. In order to escape detec-
tion, a sexual sadist, even one with extraordinary interpersonal skills, may try to 
abduct victims who are not acquaintances and to whom he cannot be linked. 
There have been some cases where seduction acquaintance molesters have 
become sadistic molesters. It is not known whether the sadistic needs developed 
late or were always there and surfaced for some reason (i.e., inhibitions overcome, 
sadistic interests fueled and validated on the Internet). Once a sadistic offender 
engages in severe sexual sadism with an acquaintance child victim, it is difficult 
to prevent disclosure and escape identification without killing or otherwise dis-
posing of the victim. In any case it is fortunate that sadistic child molesters do not 
appear to be large in number. 
Diverse This pattern was called the "sexually indiscriminate" in my old typology 
and was under the situational-child-molester category. Although the general 
pattern was always preferential, the molestation of the child was situational and 
described as such in the old typology. Because so many of these varied sexual-
behavior patterns are preferential, however, they are more clearly described as 
such in this new typology. 
Although the previously described morally indiscriminate offender can also 
be a sexual experimenter, this diverse offender differs in that he often appears to 
be discriminating in his behavior eiccept when it comes to sex. He is the "try-
sexual" —willing to try anything sexual that he prefers. While he may have dearly 
defined paraphilic or sexual preferences such as bondage, peeping, fetishism—he 
has no strong sexual preference for children. The sadistic offender could be 
included in this category, but his criminal sexual behavior is so significant that it 
merits its own category. The basic motivation of this diverse offender in victimiz-
ing children is often sexual experimentation. His main criteria for including 
children may be that they are new or less threatening. He usually involves chil-
dren in his previously existing sexual interests and activity. Such offenders may 
victimize children as part of some humiliating, taboo, or forbidden sex. It is 
important to realize that these children may be his own or ones he has gained
