.7 EPSTEIN VIRGIN ISLANDS 
Schedule of Realized Gains and Losses Current Period (continued) 
Generally, securities acquired before 2011, in retirement accounts or held 
by Non-U.S. entities are not subject to the cost basis reporting rules set 
forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and are marked 
as "noncovered". Securities marked as "covered", were identified as 
securities potentially subject to the cost 
basis reporting rules and may be reported to the IRS on form 1099-B for the 
applicable tax year in which the securities are disposed. 
Note: In the event where we cannot easily determine the taxability of an 
account, we may mark the account as noncovered. However, if the account does 
not receive a 10996, the cost basis 
will not be reported to the IRS. 
This Schedule may not reflect all cost basis adjustments necessary for tax 
reporting purposes, especially for noncovered securities. Adjustments to 
cost basis may have been made for prior 
income received and subsequently reclassified by the issuer as a return of 
capital. In addition, corporate action events may require adjustments to 
your original cost basis. Return of capital 
information and cost basis information, as it relates to corporate actions, 
has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. 
Adjustments to cost basis can be made after year-end, in particular, for 
return of capital adjustments, but may also include adjustments for 
corporate action events. Therefore there may be 
differences in cost basis reflected on your monthly client brokerage 
statement at year end versus any subsequent reports, including your 1099-B 
or online displays you may have available to 
you. 
When you report your cost basis on your tax return, it should be verified 
using all of your own records. In particular, there may be other adjustments 
which you need to make, but are not 
required to be made by Pershing as it relates to H.R. 1424. You should 
consult with your tax advisor in order to properly report your gain or loss 
for tax purposes. Pershing shall not be 
responsible for and makes no representations or warranties with respect to 
the accuracy of any information that you report to the IRS or other taxing 
authorities, and, accordingly, disclaims 
any and all liability that may arise with respect to your use and reliance 
on the information provided herein for such reporting. 
Please refer to the Your Account Information Section in your brokerage 
account statement for your account's existing tax-lot disposition method. 
The disposition method is the method which 
you have selected to use in the disposal of each tax lot of the securities 
held in your account. If you do not select a method, your account will be 
defaulted to First In, First Out (FIFO). Your 
account's selected tax lot method will be used to determine the cost basis 
for calculating gain and/or loss, unless another method was selected at the 
time of the security disposal, and this may 
be reported on the IRS Form 1099-B.
