IT, still desperately needed= reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as =AO one -off exercises 
, • airplane: re structure, (my only sugge=ted priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants up the kazoo but 
nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals=20 received without brads specific 
authorization ) - brad has no idea ev=n as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is run roughshod over by 
almost everyone in the office. he is a little man ,=20 using your power, to appear larger . Eileen was self aware enough 
to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad inf= is rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are 
taken for art space but on closer examination i= turns out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will 
be told=20 yes they were deducted on the return they said that is the question=20 they get asked ! " were they 
deducted " not -" i= there a benefit " !! I asked for the balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in 
order to check your financials. =C2 "sorry we never got one?" though 9.8 million invested, no p&I, =AO nothing , a 
construction project run amok , no budget, the coo fired aft=r only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace 
As yo=r friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive=br>The following is a list of things I think 
would be in your=interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me . 
=A0 
i suggest you form new grats. =AO, hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accoun=s as they remain the 
paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you the=r importance. , I suggest you consider having the 
49percent of <=pan>phaid=n merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank loans. no need to pay 
interest at higher rates on b=at or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do will, =AO make suydam executor , 
with Barry, =nd john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. =AO get rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts 
and their=tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more protec=ions in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute 
some money to kids let them make decisions. =, decide art division with children in attendance . have fire drill 
done=on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choos= advisers=/span> - rick bronstein said the 
only 1040 he ever=filled out was his own. ( this is brads chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be 
addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax 
consultants it consultants. plan= operation consultant.. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, =AO legal, . 
foundation , deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize investments. cash flow. reporting, gaming disclosures.=20 foreign, gift. . 
prepare tax projections for 15 and 16, . deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed. art partnership, pledges. se=l 
stock , art, deal with phaidon debt. athene,? income , capital , foreign , exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. = terminations. control. , qualified dividends. corporate tolls, inversion 
rule=. , issues, short swing and other sec disclosur=s, Rothsh=ild bank, 150 b they have a distribution network with no 
products = private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service. deal with UK=20 visa issue sooner rather than later. 
we can talk about Rowen request =e Athene , 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! 
<=iv> the facts as i see them 
in June and then again S=pt, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon<=span> payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which = fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed . 5m woudl =e reserved for the future ? . 
and out of the remaining 15m ,? i would=20 receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident=C2 that both the debt , and the 
artspace investment will also=lead to a write off of another 30 m</=pan>. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that = require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so=that I am assured that I will be 
properly compensated for my work when strategi=s that I devise are implemented . you may recall that you appear=d 
offended and said " are you suggesting that i would=go back on my word " I said no , of course not ! you are my 
closest of friends=,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually 
comes time for them to pay,.
