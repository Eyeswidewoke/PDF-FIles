complaint alleges that the defendants, negligently failed to disclose that 
they or their affiliates had a pecuniary interest in the AIG investment and 
that the plaintiffs relied upon the information and advice provided by the 
defendants to their detriment. (Am.Compl.¶¶ 55-56.) I find that Count IV 
thus adequately states a claim of negligent misrepresentation. 
6. The Rescission and Punitive Damages Counts are not Causes of Action 
The defendants contend that this Court should dismiss Counts VI and VII-for 
rescission of the note and for punitive damages—because each claim seeks 
specific relief without asserting any claim for relief. (Mem. Of Law in 
Supp. of Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 51-52.) Whereas the plaintiffs, in their 
amended complaint, have set out their request for rescission of the Amended 
1999 Note and punitive damages in the form of additional causes of action, I 
will require them to reframe them as part of the ad damnum clause. 
D. Counts I, II, III, and VI of the Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint Fail to 
Meet Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s Heightened Pleading Standard for 
Claims of Fraud 
Finally, the defendants argue that Counts I, II, III, and VI should be 
dismissed due to the plaintiffs' failure to plead fraud with the requisite 
particularity as required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). They 
aver that the amended complaint is "rife with sweeping conclusory 
allegations but fatally short on detail" and that the fraud claims fail to 
explicitly reference Citigroup, do not state any dates on which the alleged 
conduct occurred, and do net name any specific employees of the defendants. 
The defendants contend that the complaint simply does not put them on notice 
of what exactly each is accused. (Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 
32-35.) The plaintiffs counter that, although the amended complaint does not 
specify who within Citigroup or Citibank recommended the AIG investment, the 
defendants are aware of which of their employees are implicated in this 
matter. Moreover, the plaintiffs submit that the defendants are responsible 
for the "universal fungibility" of the Citigroup and Citibank names. The 
plaintiffs ask that this Court find that the amended complaint meets Rule 
9(b)'s requirements, or, alternatively, permit them to replead their 
allegations of fraud under Federal Rule 15(a). (Pis.' Mem. Of Law in Opp'n 
to Mot. To Dismiss at 30-32, 39-41.) 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) requires parties alleging fraud to 
describe the circumstances constituting fraud "with particularity." Rule 
9(b) requires that the plaintiff "give[ ] defendants notice of the claims 
against them, provide[ ] an increased measure of protection for their 
reputations, and reduce[ ] the number of frivolous suits brought solely to 
extract settlements." In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc., 311 F.3d at 215 
(quoting In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d at 1418). "Rule 
9(b) requires a plaintiff to plead (1) a specific false representation of 
material fact; (2) knowledge by the person who made it that it was false; 
(3) ignorance of its falsity by the person to whom it was made; (4) the 
intention that it should be acted upon; and (5) that the plaintiff acted 
upon it to his damage." Shapiro v. UJB Fin. Corp., 964 F.2d 272, 284 (3d Cir.-
