• • 
your Office to make its "best efforts" to accord victims their rights while simultaneously 
withholding evidence that would help them obtain those rights in court. 
Third, the attorneys in your Office have duties of candor to the Court that would not 
permit it to present evidence or testimony that is known to be false. Fla. Bar Rule 4-3.3(a)(4). 
Allowing the victims access to evidence favorable to their claim will insure compliance with this 
rule. Similarly, in an ex parte proceeding, a lawyer must inform the court of all material facts 
known to the lawyer that will enable the court to make an informed decision "whether or not 
the facts are adverse." Fla. Bar. Rule 4-3.3(d). If your Office is correct that we are not entitled 
to access to favorable evidence, then the proceedings involving that evidence are essentially ex 
parte — requiring your Office to make disclosure to the Court. Surely the more appropriate way 
to proceed is to simply disclose those materials in the first instance to the victims. 
Fourth and finally, your Office has previously taken the position that the CVRA petition 
filed by the victims Is covered by the civil rules. If so, then the victims can serve discovery 
requests as in any other civil cases. The victims can likewise take depositions of witnesses who 
possess relevant evidence to their claims. Indeed, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A), your Office 
would be required to automatically produce such information. 
For all these reasons, it is our considered opinion that your Office does not have a 
legally well-founded position to withhold evidence from the victims In this case. Even if the 
Office did have such a position, however, we are mystified as to why your Office would want to 
assert such a position. Attorney General Holder has recently publicly discussed the 
Department's obligations regarding production of exculpatory information to criminals, 
explaining "We're not here to win cases, but to do justice." Attorney General Holder Discusses 
Efforts to Improve Prosecutor Training, WALL ST.J., Apr. 30, 2010. With all respect, we submit 
that your Office should seek to do justice not merely for criminals, but also for the victims of 
those criminals. We therefore respectfully request that you simply provide this information to 
us as a matter of justice, avoiding the need for us to litigate this question. To avoid burdening 
your Office, we would be happy to provide a specific list of the information that we believe is 
material to the victims' CVRA case — a limited amount of information that could be swiftly 
located by your Office. 
Conclusion 
We frankly believe we have been very patient on this case and have gone to the extra 
mile to avoid an unnecessary fight with your Office. But our clients are asking us what the 
status of their case is, and we have an obligation to proceed diligently. Our first choice is to 
work something out with you. But if your Office is for some reason unwilling or unable to do 
that, we believe we have an overwhelming case of clear cut CVRA violations — a case that we 
will present to the Court.
