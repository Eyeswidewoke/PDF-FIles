How to Cope with the Jerk at Work - The Capessa Blog: Sharing the Wisdom of Women ... Page 2 of 3 
Your best bet in this type of scenario is to sit down with your Mr. Difficult 
and have a heart to heart. Tell him how you are feeling. assume that he 
doesn't mean to act like the devil incarnate. and give him the benefit of 
the doubt Solicit his feedback regarding how the two of you can improve 
the relationship and then give him a chance to do right by you. If this 
doesn't work and he continues to regularly use you as target practice. 
remove yourself from the situation No job is worth your self-esteem 
One caveat to all this: Human beings operate with such different styles 
that it's impossible for us to get along with all of our colleagues all of the 
time. You could be the most agreeable person on earth, but I guarantee 
that someone at work will find a reason not to like you. Maybe she isn't 
blatantly obvious or malicious like Mr. Difficult, but you can feel her 
negativity just the same. She might walk right past your desk without 
saying good morning and probably doesn't engage in friendly 
conversation with you the way she does with other people in the office 
For those of us with a sensitive streak, this type of behavior can be hurtful 
too What did you do to her anyway? Why won't she give you a fair shot? 
As natural as it is to fixate on the situation, if it's not affecting your daily 
working life or your career path. refuse to take it personally and go about 
your business Focus on your reasons for being at work and save your 
energy for the people in the office who deserve it.
