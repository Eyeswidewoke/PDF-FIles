Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Our business is subject to extensive regulation and we may incur additional 
costs or liabilities as a result of government regulation of our 
restaurants. 
Our business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign 
government regulation, including, among others, regulations related to the 
preparation and sale of food, the sale of alcoholic beverages, zoning and 
building codes, land use and employee, health, sanitation and safety 
matters. 
Typically, our licenses to sell alcoholic beverages must be renewed annually 
and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause. 
Alcoholic beverage control regulations govern various aspects of daily 
operations of our restaurants, including the minimum age of guests and 
employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and 
inventory control, handling and storage. Any failure by any of our 
restaurants 
to obtain and maintain, on a timely basis, liquor or other licenses, permits 
or approvals required to serve alcoholic beverages or food, as well as any 
associated negative publicity, could delay or prevent the opening of, or 
adversely impact the viability of, and could have an adverse effect on, that 
restaurant and its operating and financial performance. We apply for our 
liquor licenses with the advice of outside legal counsel and licensing 
consultants. Because of the many and various state and federal licensing and 
permitting requirements, there is a significant risk that one or more 
regulatory agencies could determine that we have not complied with 
applicable licensing or permitting regulations or have not maintained the 
approvals necessary for us to conduct business within its jurisdiction. Any 
changes in the application or interpretation of existing laws may 
adversely impact our restaurants in that state, and could also cause us to 
lose, either temporarily or permanently, the licenses, permits and 
regulations necessary to conduct our restaurant operations, and subject us 
to fines and penalties. 
There is also a potential for increased regulation of certain food 
establishments in the United States, where compliance with a Hazard Analysis 
and Critical Control Points ("HACCP") approach would be required. HACCP 
refers to a management system in which food safety is addressed 
through the analysis and control of potential hazards from production, 
procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption 
of the finished product. Many states have required restaurants to develop 
and implement HACCP Systems, and the United States government 
continues to expand the sectors of the food industry that must adopt and 
implement HACCP programs. For example, the Food Safety 
Modernization Act (the "FSMA"), signed into law in January 2011, granted the 
FDA new authority regarding the safety of the entire food system, 
including through increased inspections and mandatory food recalls. Although 
restaurants are specifically exempted from or not directly implicated 
by some of these new requirements, we anticipate that the new requirements 
may impact our industry. Additionally, our suppliers may initiate or 
otherwise be subject to food recalls that may impact the availability of 
certain products, result in adverse publicity or require us to take actions
