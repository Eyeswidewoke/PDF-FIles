■ BUSINESS 
Bloomberg BusInessweek 
August 5, 2019 
ill may be a result of the 2016 departure of Victoria's 
Secret's longtime CEO, Sharen Jester Turney, who'd 
guided the brand for a decade while managing to 
convince many consumers that its celebration of 
the feminine body was a form of female empow-
erment. Turney left because she didn't agree with 
the direction Wexner wanted to take the business, 
according to a person familiar with their conver-
sations. "With her gone, the men really just took 
over," says one former executive. "And these were 
men who had one ideal of women, and it's not 
based in reality:' 
Jan Singer, who replaced Turney, left last year 
soon after Razek made comments some plus-size 
models and the transgender community found 
demeaning. Singer was replaced by a man, leaving 
L Brands with only two women among the 10 listed 
executive officers and brand leaders. At the urging of 
activist investor Barington Capital Group, L Brands 
this spring added two more women to its board. 
The failure to embrace changing norms about 
women and beauty may already be having an 
impact on Victoria's Secret's results. After rising 
steadily since 2010, sales fell to $7.4 billion in fis-
cal 2017—the first drop in seven years—and edged 
slightly lower again last year. Sales at stores open 
for more than 12 months, a closely watched met-
ric in retailing, also slipped in 2018, with operating 
income at the unit tumbling 45%, to $512.4 million. 
Those poor results have led L Brands to tighten 
its purse strings, resulting in the shuttering of 
dozens of underperforming locations. L Brands 
announced in February plans to dose about 53 
Victoria's Secrets in North America this year, more 
than three times the 15 it's historically closed in an 
average year. "Given the decline in performance at 
Victoria's Secret, we have substantially pulled back 
on capital investment in that business," L Brands 
executives said in prepared commentary in May 
after reporting a further 5% drop in same-store 
sales in 2019's first quarter. 
Another notable change: In May, Victoria's 
Secret pulled its fashion show from network tele-
vision after 23 years. Ratings bottomed out in 2018, 
with only 3.3 million viewers, down from the pre-
vious all-time low of 5 million the year prior. The 
annual show is expected to move to streaming. 
There may be limits to just how much Victoria's 
Secret can change its messaging: American Engle 
Outfitters Ink's rival Aerie line has found a base of 
passionate customers who are younger and more 
diverse and are calling for brands to have body-
inclusive messages. That's helped Aerie log 18 con-
secutive quarters of double-digit same-store sales. 
One advantage is that Aerie doesn't have 40 years 
of branding to overcome. "There's been very 
interesting growth in consumers embracing this 
more holistic body-image view, but it's probably too 
far of a step away from what the DNA of Victoria's 
Secret is," says Alex Arnold, a managing direc-
tor of the consumer practice at investment bank 
Odeon Capital Group LLC. "It would be a whole-
sale repositioning of the company." -Kim Bhasin,

THE BOTTOM LINE Victoria's Secret long prospered by 
promoting its sexy lingerie. But changing norms about women 
and beauty could put that growth at risk.

• By acquiring Avon, Brazil's Natura plans to turn 
its army of direct salespeople into online influencers 
On a pleasant Tuesday in May, dozens of beauty 
influencers gathered at the New York Botanical 
Garden in the Bronx for a vegan lunch and a panel 
on sustainability in cosmetics. As they sipped pas-
sion fruit caipirinhas, the young women snapped 
photos of lotions and soaps featuring exotic ingre-
dients such as murumuru and priprioca. 
They're the types of products that made host 
Natura Cosmeticos SA a beauty giant in Brazil—
and that the so-year-old company wants to bring 
to the rest of the world. With its agreement in May 
to buy Avon Products Inc., Natura is accelerating its 
global ambitions and betting its brand of natural, 
ethically sourced cosmetics will appeal to millen-
nial and Generation 2 consumers who increasingly 
want sustainable goods. 
The company wants to attract social media 
enthusiasts such as Ava Lee a New Yorker who was 
at the Bronx event. "I love that all Natura Brasil 
products are clean and sustainable," says Lee—
@glowwithava on Instagram—who often posts pho-
tos of cosmetics for her almost 24,000 followers. 
"It's hard to come by products that smell this good 
and at the same time are very gentle on the skin 
and don't cause irritations:.
Natura's $2 billion purchase of Avon—the very 
company it had long emulated with its door-to-
door direct-selling model—will make it the world's 
fourth-biggest cosmetics company and among the 
largest focused on natural products. About 80% 
"In other

In Brazil it 
started the
