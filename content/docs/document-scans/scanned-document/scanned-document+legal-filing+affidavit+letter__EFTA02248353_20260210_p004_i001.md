Intermediary Disclosure. Amex assists you in finding travel suppliers and making arrangements 
that meet your individual needs. We consider various factors in identifying travel suppliers to you 
and recommending specific itineraries. In this role, we are acting as an independent third party 
and not as a fiduciary. We want you to be aware that certain suppliers pay us commissions as well 
as incentives for reaching sales targets or other goals, and from time to time may also provide 
incentives to our travel counselors. Certain suppliers may also provide compensation to us for 
various marketing and administrative services that we perform for them, such as granting them 
access to our marketing channels, participating in marketing programs and supporting technology 
initiatives. In addition, we receive compensation from suppliers when customers use the American 
Express Card or other American Express products to pay for supplier products and services. From 
time to time we may enter into other business relationships with suppliers and these 
arrangements, including levels and types of compensation and incentives we receive, are subject 
to change. In identifying suppliers and recommending itineraries, we may consider a number of 
factors, including supplier availability and your preferences. The relationships we have with 
suppliers may also influence the suppliers we identify and the itineraries we recommend.
