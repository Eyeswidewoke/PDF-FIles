Right-of-Way Easement No. RW-30137 
ESTABLISHED NEW MEXICO STATE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT RIGHT-
OF-WAY, AND IF IT IS, GRANTEE WILL OBTAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT A PERMIT THAT 
PRESCRIBES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH FACILITIES MAY BE PLACED WITHIN THE 
RIGHT-OF-WAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S APPLICABLE RULES AND 
REGULATIONS. GRANTEE FURTHER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT THE FAILURE TO 
OBTAIN SUCH PERMIT SHALL RESULT IN THE FORCIBLE REMOVAL BY THE DEPARTMENT OF 
ANY FACILITIES THAT MAY BE CONSTRUCTED OR INSTALLED WITHIN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. 
4. 
In clearing the right-of-way, Grantee agrees to dispose of brush and other debris so as not to interfere 
with the movement of livestock of state agriculture lessees. 
5. 
All pipelines placed on said lands by virtue of this grant shall be buried not less than twenty inches 
(20") deep. An exception to this requirement may be granted on other than agricultural lands when hard 
rock is encountered which would require blasting, or when a temporary pipeline is necessary and will 
not unduly hamper other surface uses. Deviation of the twenty-inch depth must be shown on the plat 
accompanying the application for right-of-way or by the filing of an amended plat upon completion of 
construction. 
6. 
Grantee hereby agrees to carefully avoid destruction or injury to any improvements or livestock lawfully 
upon the premises described herein, to close all gates immediately upon passing through same, and to 
pay promptly the reasonable and just damages for any injury or destruction arising from construction or 
maintenance of this right-of way. 
7. 
Grantee shall not assign this right-of-way without the prior written approval of Grantor. Such approval 
may be conditioned upon the agreement by Grantee's assignee to additional conditions and covenants 
and may require payment of additional compensation to Grantor. This right-of-way is for the sole 
purpose stated and no other. Grantee agrees not to sell or otherwise grant to any person or entity any 
interest therein or the right to use any portion thereof. 
8. 
The rights granted herein arc subject to valid existing rights. 
9. 
Grantor reserves the right to execute leases for oil and gas, coal, and minerals of whatsoever kind and 
for geothermal resources development and operation, the right to sell or dispose of same and the right to 
grant rights-of-way and easements related to such leasing. 
10. 
In all matter affecting the premises described herein or operations thereon, Grantee, its employees, 
agents and contractors shall, at their own expense, fully comply with all laws, regulations, rules, 
ordinances, and requirements of any governmental authority or agency, which may be enacted or 
promulgated, including, but not limited to, requirements or enactment's pertaining to conservation, 
sanitation, aesthetics, pollution, cultural properties, fire, or ecology, including those provisions of the 
New Mexico Cultural Properties Act, §§18-6-1 through 17, NMSA 1978, that attach criminal penalties to 
the appropriation, excavation, injury or destruction of any site or object of historical, archaeological, 
architectural, or scientific value located on state lands. In addition, Grantee, its employees, agents and 
contractors must comply with the provisions of the Pipeline Safety Act, §§ 70-3-11 through 20, NMSA 
1978, and rules enacted pursuant to the Act, and agree to provide the Public Regulation Commission 
access to records of compliance. 
11. 
Non-use of the right-of-way granted herein for any period in excess of one (1) year without the 
prior written consent of Grantor shall be conclusive proof of abandonment of the right-of-way, 
and non-use for shorter periods shall place upon grantee the burden of providing that there was 
no intent to abandon.
