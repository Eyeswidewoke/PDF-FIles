Statement Period: 06/01/2015 - 06/30/2015 
Schedule of Realized Gains and Losses Current Period (continued) 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities may be adjusted for amortization, 
accretion, original issue discount adjustments, or principal paydowns. The 
calculation is based upon the taxpayer election, type of fixed 
income security, and certain attributes, obtained from sources believed to 
be reliable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there 
may be a temporary incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected 
until the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These 
calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including 
those involving foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with 
less than one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide 
and you should consult your tax advisor in the preparation of your tax 
returns. 
u These shares are unsettled and have been recently disposed. You will also 
see these shares on the Portfolio Holdings section until this transaction 
has been settled. 
Please refer to the Your Account Information Section in your brokerage 
account statement for your account's existing tax-lot disposition method. 
The disposition method is the method which you have selected to 
use in the disposal of each tax lot of the securities held in your account. 
If you do not select a method, your account will be defaulted to First In, 
First Out (FIFO). Your account's selected tax lot method will be 
used to determine the cost basis for calculating gain and/or loss, unless 
another method was selected at the time of the security disposal, and this 
may be reported on the IRS Form 1099-B.

Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your 
investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a 
money market mutual fund. Shares of a money 
market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your 
brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds credited 
to your brokerage account. Please see the 
money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's 
disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional information. 
Please be advised that Reich & Tang Asset Management, LLC will be 
liquidating its funds (the "R&T Funds") by the end of July 2015 and as such 
the R&T Funds will no longer be available as money market 
funds in the DBSI cash sweep program (the "Sweep Program"). 
What this means for you: 
If you are currently invested in an R&T Fund, please refer to our earlier 
letter for more information about your available cash sweep options, or 
contact your client advisor. 
If you are not currently invested in the R&T Funds, this change will not 
affect the existing sweep for your uninvested cash balances and no action is 
required on your part. 
For information on all cash sweep options available in the Sweep Program, 
please visit our website at: http://wealth.deutscheawm.com/americas/en/-

Options-Rates".
