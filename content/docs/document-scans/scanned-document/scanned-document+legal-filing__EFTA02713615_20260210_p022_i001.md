INVESTOR SUITABILITY 
The purchase of Interests should be considered as a long-term investment. A prospective 
investor, in determining whether Interests are a suitable investment, should consider carefully 
that there will be a limited number of Interests sold, the transferability thereof will be limited and 
no public or secondary market will develop for Interests. The Interests have not been registered 
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and accordingly cannot be 
resold unless each is so registered or an exemption from such registration requirement is 
available, state securities laws are complied with and the consent of the General Partner is 
obtained. Investors will be required to acknowledge in writing to the Partnership that they 
understand that the Limited Partnership Agreement will indicate such restrictions and that their 
Interests may not be resold except in compliance with such provisions. A registration statement
