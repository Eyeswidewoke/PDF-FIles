Default, or an event which, upon the serving of a Default Notice, would be 
an Event of Default, occurs in relation to it. 
11. 
Tax Event 
(a) 
This paragraph shall apply if either party notifies the other that 
(i) 
any action taken by a taxing authority or brought in a court of 
competent jurisdiction (regardless of whether such action is taken or 
brought with respect to a party to this Agreement); or 
(ii) 
a change in the fiscal or regulatory regime (including, but not 
limited to, a change in law or in the general interpretation of law but 
excluding any change in any rate of tax), 
has or will, in the notifying party's reasonable opinion, have a material 
adverse effect on that party in the context of a Transaction. 
(b) 
If so requested by the other party, the notifying party will 
furnish the other with an opinion of a suitably qualified adviser that an 
event referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii) above has occurred and 
affects the notifying party. 
(c) 
Where this paragraph applies, the party giving the notice referred 
to in subparagraph (a) may, subject to subparagraph (d) below, terminate the 
Transaction with effect from a date specified in the notice, not being 
earlier (unless so agreed by the other party) than 30 days after the date of 
the notice, by nominating that date as the Repurchase Date. 
(d) 
If the party receiving the notice referred to in subparagraph (a) 
so elects, it may override that notice by giving a counter-notice to the 
other party. If a counter-notice is given, the party which gives the counter-
notice will be deemed to have agreed to indemnify the other party against 
the adverse effect referred to in subparagraph (a) so far as relates to the 
relevant Transaction and the original Repurchase Date will continue to apply. 
(e) 
Where a Transaction is terminated as described in this paragraph, 
the party which has given the notice to terminate shall indemnify the other 
party against any reasonable legal and other professional expenses incurred 
by the other party by reason of the termination, but the other party may not 
claim any sum by way of consequential loss or damage in respect of a 
termination in accordance with this paragraph. 
(f) 
This paragraph is without prejudice to paragraph 6(b) (obligation 
to pay additional amounts if withholding or deduction required); but an 
obligation to pay such additional amounts may, where appropriate, be a 
circumstance which causes this paragraph to apply. 
12. 
Interest 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any sum of money payable 
hereunder or under any Transaction is not paid when due, interest shall 
accrue on the unpaid sum as a separate debt at the greater of the Pricing 
Rate for the Transaction to which such sum relates (where such sum is 
preferable to a Transaction) and LIBOR on a 360 day basis or 365 day basis 
in accordance with the applicable ISMA convention, for the actual number of 
days during the period from and including the date on which payment was due 
to, but excluding, the date of payment. 
13. 
Single Agreement 
Each party acknowledges that, and has entered into this Agreement and will 
enter into each Transaction hereunder in consideration of and in reliance 
upon the fact that all Transactions hereunder constitute a single business 
and contractual relationship and are made in consideration of each other.
