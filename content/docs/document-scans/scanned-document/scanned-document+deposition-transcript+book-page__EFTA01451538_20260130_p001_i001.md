SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
It is the General Partner's policy to treat Limited Partners fairly. Consistent with this 
policy and applicable rules and regulations, the terms negotiated with individual Limited 
Partners may vary for a number of reasons, including a Limited Partner's regulatory and/or 
tax status or other requirements or policies applicable to it, the amount of a Limited 
Partner's commitment to the Partnership, a Limited Partner's overall commercial 
relationship with the General Partner, the Investment Manager and/or any of their 
affiliates, and the nature of a particular investment. 
Borrowing. The Onshore Feeder Fund may borrow money in an aggregate amount of up 
to 20% of the total capital commitments to the Onshore Feeder Fund (the "Capital 
Commitments"), including pursuant to a credit facility or other loans from a third party. 
Such borrowing provides the advantages of leverage, but exposes the Onshore Feeder Fund 
to capital risk and higher current expenses. The Onshore Feeder Fund may provide 
collateral to the banks from which it borrows by pledging some or all of the assets of the 
Onshore Feeder Fund (the "Onshore Feeder Fund Assets") and/or the Capital 
Commitments to the Onshore Feeder Fund. In such event, the Onshore Feeder Fund may 
also be required to delegate the rights to issue drawdown notices and to receive capital 
contributions to a third party. This procedure exposes the Onshore Feeder Fund to the risk 
that for whatever reason, including, without limitation, the default, insolvency, negligence, 
misconduct or fraud of such banks, the Onshore Feeder Fund will not reacquire the 
ownership of such Onshore Feeder Fund Assets upon the repayment by the Onshore Feeder 
Fund of such loans. Also, the Onshore Feeder Fund will be unable to reacquire such 
Onshore Feeder Fund Assets if the Onshore Feeder Fund defaults on such loans. The 
Onshore Feeder Fund's failure or inability to reacquire such Onshore Feeder Fund Assets 
from the banks in whose name the Onshore Feeder Fund Assets are pledged in support of a 
loan could involve the Onshore Feeder Fund in protracted litigation and, potentially, result 
in the complete loss of such Onshore Feeder Fund Assets. While the Investment Manager 
will cause the Onshore Feeder Fund to borrow money only from banks it believes to be 
creditworthy, there can be no absolute certainty that such banks will return such Onshore 
Feeder Fund Assets to the Onshore Feeder Fund upon the repayment of such loans. 
The Master Fund may also borrow funds including pursuant to a credit facility or other 
loans from a third party. Such borrowings may require the Master Fund Manager, on behalf 
of the Master Fund General Partner, to pledge all or a portion of the property of the Master 
Fund and/or the commitments to the Master Fund (including the Onshore Feeder Fund's 
commitment to the Master Fund). 
Over-Commitment Strategy. 
The Onshore Feeder Fund may employ an 
over-commitment strategy solely to cover expenses of the Feeder Funds and defaults by 
Limited Partners. The Investment Manager may cause the Onshore Feeder Fund to 
commit to the Master Fund an aggregate amount in excess of the Limited Partners' Capital 
Commitments to the Onshore Feeder Fund, in which event the excess, if called by the 
Master Fund, would be funded through the distributions received from the Master Fund (in
