rating agencies' opinions regarding their credit quality and are not a guarantee of quality. Rating agencies attempt to 
evaluate the likelihood that the obligor will make principal and interest payments and do not evaluate the risks of 
fluctuations in market value. Therefore, credit ratings may not fully reflect all of the risks of an investment. In 
addition. rating agencies may not make immediate changes in credit ratings in response to events that impact an 
obligor, so that an obligor's current financial condition may be worse than a rating indicates when compared with 
other obligors with equivalent ratings. 
Risk Factors Relating to the Issuer and its Service Providers 
Certain Conflicts of Interest Related to the Investment Manager. On the Closing Date, the Investment Manager 
and/or one or more of its Affiliates are expected to purchase approximately $2.2 million of the Subordinated Notes. 
Such Subordinated Notes may be transferred to related or unrelated parties at any time after the Closing Date. The 
Investment Manager and its Affiliates may purchase other Classes of Securities. The Initial Purchaser will waive 
the payment of its fee for such sales to the Investment Manager and its Affiliates, which will be in the form of a 
discount on the purchase price. On the Closing Date, the Investment Manager will be reimbursed by the Issuer for 
certain of its expenses incurred in connection with the organization of the Issuer (including legal fees and expenses). 
The Investment Manager has provided and, prior to the Closing Date, will continue to provide financing to the 
Issuer for the purchase of Collateral Obligations for which it is being paid a financing fee. See "—Pm-Closing 
Collateral Accumulation? 
Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the overall investment activities of the Investment 
Manager, its Affiliates and their respective clients and employees. The Investment Manager and its Affiliates may 
invest, on behalf of themselves and other clients, in securities that would be appropriate as Collateral. The 
Investment Manager and its Affiliates may give advice or take action for their own account or their other client 
accounts with similar strategies that may differ from advice given or action taken for the Issuer. The Investment 
Manager and its Affiliates may also have ongoing relationships with companies whose securities are included in the 
Collateral, and may own. directly or through other funds that they manage, equity or debt securities issued by 
obligors of obligations included in the Collateral. The Investment Manager and its Affiliates may also provide 
certain services for a negotiated fee to companies whose obligations are pledged by the Issuer as Collateral. In 
addition, the Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective clients and employees may invest, or have 
already invested, in obligations and/or other securities that are identical to or senior to, or have interests different 
from or adverse to. the Collateral Obligations. In addition. the Investment Manager or any of its Affiliates may 
serve as a general partner, adviser, officer, director, sponsor or manager of partnerships or companies organized to 
issue collateralized bond or loan obligations secured by non-investment grade bank loans. The Investment Manager 
may at certain times be engaged in seeking investments to purchase for the Issuer while at the same time the 
Investment Manager or one or more Affiliates is also seeking to purchase or has already purchased similar or 
identical investments for its own account or clients or Affiliates or another entity for which it serves as a general 
partner, adviser, officer, director, sponsor or manager. By reason of the various activities of the Investment 
Manager and its Affiliates, the Investment Manager and such Affiliates may acquire confidential or material 
non-public information or be restricted front effecting transactions in certain Collateral Obligations or other 
Collateral that otherwise might have been initiated or prevented from liquidating a position. At times, the 
Investment Manager, in an effort to avoid restrictions for the Issuer and its other clients, may elect not to receive 
information that other market participants or counterparties arc eligible to receive or have received. 
Neither the Investment Manager nor any of its Affiliates has any affirmative obligation to offer any investments to 
the Issuer or to inform the Issuer of any invesunents before offering any investments to other funds or accounts that 
the Investment Manager or am of its Affiliates manage or advise. The Investment Manager and its Affiliates may 
also make investments on their own behalf without offering such investment opportunities to the Issuer. 
Furthermore, the Investment Manager and its Affiliates may be bound by affirmative obligations at present or in the 
futum, whereby it or they arc obligated to offer certain investments to funds or accounts that it or they manage or 
advise before or without the Investment Manager or its Affiliates offering those investments to the Issuer. 
Alternatively, the Investment Manager and its Affiliates may offer certain investments to funds or accounts that it or 
they manage or advise simultaneously with or in addition to offering those investments to the Issuer. Thus, other 
funds or accounts that it or they manage or advise could become co-investors with the Issuer. 
The Investment Manager will endeavor to resolve conflicts with respect to investment opportunities in a manner that 
it deems equitable to the extent possible under the prevailing facts and circumstances. Further, the Investment
