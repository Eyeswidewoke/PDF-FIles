Who Maimed the Economy, and How 
By A. O. SCOTT 
"Inside Job," a sleek, briskly paced film whose title sugg=sts a heist movie, is the story of a crime without punishment, of 
an outr=ge that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. Th= betrayal of public trust and collective 
values that Mr. Ferguson chronic=es was far more brazen and damaging than the adultery in Nathaniel Hawtho=ne's 
novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than villain.=20 The gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm 
reflection and grow= angrier and more incredulous as it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. Th= density of information 
and the complexity of the subject matter make =80 Inside Job" feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by=the end 
Mr. Ferguson has summoned the scourging moral force of a pulpit-s=aking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, 
restraint and good humor ma=es his case all the more devastating. 
He is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books=and articles retracing the paths that led the 
world economy to the precip=ce two years ago. The deregulation of the financial services industry in=the 1980s and 
'90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky=derivatives; the real estate bubble and the explosion of subprime 
lending=— none of these developments were exactly secret. On the contrary= they were celebrated as vindications of 
the power and wisdom of markets.=Accordingly, Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courte=y of 
Lawrence H. Summers, George W. Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cabl= television ranters and squawkers. 
Even as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at lea=t a few investors, economists and 
government officials who warned that th= frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of these prophets 
wi=hout honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson's camera, less to glo=t than to present, once again, the analyses that 
were dismissed and ignor=d by their peers for so long. 
Dozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial=shots of New York, Iceland and other disaster areas —
are folded=into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an=opening song, "Big Time," by 
Peter Gabriel, and a score=by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen cinematography provide an aesth=tic polish that is 
welcome for its own sake and also important to the mov=e's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors 
convey=a sense of the rarefied, privileged worlds in which the Wall Street opera=ors and their political enablers 
flourished, and the elegance of the pres=ntation also subliminally bolsters the film's authority. This is=not a piece of 
ragged muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its out=age on reason, research and careful argument. 
The same was true of Mr. Ferguson's previous documentary, =9CNo End in Sight," which focused on catastrophic 
policies carrie= out in Iraq by President George W. Bush's administration just after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. 
But whereas that film concentrated on=a narrow view of a complex subject — the conduct of the war rathe= than the at 
least equally controversial rationale for fighting it =94 "Inside Job" offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far=back as the 
Reagan administration and as far afield as Iceland in its ana=omy of the financial crisis. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be=interviewed. Mr. Summers appears only in 
news footage, and none of his pr=decessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not Robert E. Rub=n or Henry M.
