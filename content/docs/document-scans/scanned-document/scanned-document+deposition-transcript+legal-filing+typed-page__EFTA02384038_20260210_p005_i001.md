China's Arms Industry Makes Global Inroads

October 20, 2013 -- Beijing — From the moment Turkey announced plans two =ears ago to acquire a long-range missile 
defense system, the multibillion-=ollar contract from a key NATO member appeared to be an American company=92s to 
lose. 
For years, Turkey's military had relied on NATO-supplied Patriot missiles= built by the American companies Raytheon 
and Lockheed Martin, to defend i=s skies, and the system was fully compatible with the air-defense platform= operated 
by other members of the alliance. 
There were other contenders for the deal, of course. Rival manufacturers in=Russia and Europe made bids. Turkey 
rejected those — but not in favor of=the American companies. Its selection last month of a little-known 
Chinese=defense company, China Precision Machinery Export-Import Corp<http://cmc.g=nertec.com.cn/enk 
oration<http://cmc.genertec.com.cn/en/>, stunned the mi=itary-industrial establishment in Washington and Brussels. 
The sale was especially unusual because the Chinese missile defense system,=known as the HQ-9, would be difficult to 
integrate with existing NATO equi=ment. China Precision is also subject to sanctions from the United States =or selling 
technologies that the United States says could help Iran, Syria=and North Korea develop unconventional weapons. A 
State Department spokesw=man said this month that American officials had expressed to the Turkish g=vernment 
"serious concerns" about the deal, which has not yet been sig=ed. 
Industry executives and arms-sales analysts say the Chinese probably beat o=t their more established rivals by 
significantly undercutting them on pric=, offering their system at $3 billion. Nonetheless, Turkey's selection o= a Chinese 
state-owned manufacturer is a breakthrough for China, a nation =hat has set its sights on moving up the value chain in 
arms technology and=establishing itself as a credible competitor in the global weapons market. 
"This is a remarkable win for the Chinese arms industry," said Pieter W=zeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm 
International Peace Research l=stitute<http://www.sipri.orgh, which tracks arms sales and transfers. 
In the past, Chinese companies have been known mainly as suppliers of small=arms, but that is changing quickly. From 
drones to frigates to fighter jet=, the companies are aggressively pushing foreign sales of high-tech hardwa=e, mostly in 
the developing world. Russian companies are feeling the great=st pressure, but American and other Western companies 
are also increasingl= running into the Chinese. 
"China will be competing with us in many, many domains, and in the high e=d," said Marwan Lahoud, the head of 
strategy and marketing at European A=ronautic Defense and Space<http://www.eads.com/eads/int/en.html>, 
Europe=92s largest aerospace company. "Out of 100 campaigns, that is, the comme=cial prospects we have, we may 
have the Chinese in front of us among the c=mpetitors in about three or four. They have the full range of capabilities= 
and they are offering them." 
The Stockholm institute released a report this year on global weapons trans=ers that found the volume of Chinese 
conventional weapons exports — whic= included high-end aircraft, missiles, ships and artillery — jumped by 1=2 percent 
from 2008 to 2012, compared with the previous five years. Pakist=n is the leading customer. The institute now estimates 
that China is the f=fth-largest arms exporter in the world, ahead of Britain. From 2003 to 200=, China ranked eighth. 
China's foreign arms sales are also rising fast in dollar terms. Accordin= to IHS Jane's<http://www.janes.comh, an 
industry consulting and analys=s company, Chinese exports have nearly doubled over the past five years to=$2.2 billion, 
surpassing Canada and Sweden, and making China the world's=eighth-largest exporter by value. 
The total global arms trade revenue in 2012 was estimated to be $73.5 billi=n, and the United States had a 39 percent 
share, according to IHS Jane's=
