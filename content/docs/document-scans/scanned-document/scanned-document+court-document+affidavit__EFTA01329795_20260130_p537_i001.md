the Lien of this Mortgage in favor of the Mortgagee; (ii) at all times cause to be maintained, 
serviced, repaired, overhauled and tested each Airframe, Engine, and Part, or other relevant 
Mortgage Collateral, so as to the good operating condition as when originally mortgaged 
hereunder, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and, in the case of each Aircraft, in such condition 
as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of such Aircraft to be maintained in 
good standing at all times under the Act and to enable such Aircraft at all times to be operated in 
commercial cargo service in the United States; and (iii) maintain all records, logs and other 
materials required by the FAA and any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction to be 
maintained in respect of such Mortgaged Collateral. The Grantor will comply with all material 
rules and regulations of the FAA. The Grantor agrees that the Airframes, Engines and Parts and 
any other Mortgage Collateral will not be maintained, used or operated: (A) in violation of any 
material law or any rule, regulation or order of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction 
(domestic or foreign), or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or registration 
relating to any Mortgage Collateral issued by any such Governmental Authority, except for any 
violation which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a 
Material Adverse Effect; (B) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance required by 
the terms of subsection 4.5 hereof, except in the case of a requisition for use by the United States 
of America, and then only if the Grantor obtains indemnity in lieu of such insurance from the 
United States of America against the risks and in the amounts required by said subsection 4.5 
covering such area, or as to which the Grantor has otherwise obtained the written consent of the 
Mortgagee; or (C) in any recognized or threatened area of hostilities unless fully covered to the 
Mortgagee's satisfaction by war-risk insurance, or unless such Airframe, Engine, Parts or other 
Mortgage Collateral are operated or used under contract with the Government of United States of 
America under which contract said Government assumes liability for any the damage, loss, 
destruction or failure to return possession of such Airframe, Engine, Parts or Mortgage Collateral 
at the end of the term of such contract and for injury to persons or damage to property of others 
or unless the Aircraft is only temporarily located in such area as a result of an isolated 
occurrence attributable to a hijacking, medical emergency, equipment malfunction, weather 
conditions, navigational error or other similar unforeseen circumstances and the Grantor is using 
its good faith efforts to remove the Aircraft from such area. For purposes of this Section 4.1, a 
"material" law, rule, regulation or order of the FAA or any other Governmental Authority having 
jurisdiction (domestic or foreign) is one the violation of which may lead to an enforcement 
action by the FAA or such Governmental Authority or suspension, revocation or limitation of 
Grantor's authority to operate as a Certificated Air Carrier. 
4.2 
Liens. The Grantor will not create or suffer to exist any Lien, International 
Interests or Prospective International Interest upon or with respect to any of the Mortgage 
Collateral, except for Permitted Liens and any other Liens permitted by the terms hereof and of 
the Term Note Agreement. 
4.3 
Taxes. The Grantor will pay, and hereby indemnifies the Mortgagee and each 
Lender from and against, any and all fees and taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges or 
withholdings, together with any penalties, fines or interest thereon (any of the foregoing being 
here called a "Im") which may from time to time be imposed on or asserted against the 
Mortgagee or any Airframe, Engine or Part or other Mortgage Collateral or any interest therein 
by any Federal, state or local government or other taxing authority in the United States or by any 
foreign government or subdivision thereof or by any foreign taxing authority upon or with
