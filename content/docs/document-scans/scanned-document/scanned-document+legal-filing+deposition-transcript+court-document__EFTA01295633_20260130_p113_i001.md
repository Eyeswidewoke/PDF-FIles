2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
To adequately allege a duty to disclose, the Plaintiff must allege facts upon which that duty 
may arise. See Fowler v. Goodman Mfg. Co. LP, No. 2:14-CV-968-RDP, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 172114, 2014 WL 7048581, at *9-10 (N.D. Ala. Dec. 12, 2014); Shedd v. Wells 
Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc., Civil Action No. 14-00275-CB-M, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
160997, 2014 WL 6451245, at *5 (S.D. Ala. Nov. 17, 2014). 
A duty to disclose often arises when there is a confidential or fiduciary relationship between the parties. [Ellis v. tuck, 
409 F. Supp. 1151, 1157 (RD. Ala. 1976), WM, 546 F.2d 643 (5th Cir. 1977).] The Alabama courts do not seem to 
lotus on the "designation of the relationship, such as vendor-vendee, etc., but instead look to the relative bargaining 
positions of the parties." Id. (citing (Hall Motor Co. v.] Furman. 285 Ata. 499.234 So. 2d [37.] 41 [(Ala. 1970)]. 
Metropolitan Life Mt Co. v. James. 238 Ala. 337. 191 So. 352 (1939)) (cited with approval in Jim Walter Homes. Inc. v. 
Waldrop. 448 So. 2d 301, 305 (Ala. 1983) (per curiam)): Jim Short Ford Sales(. Inc.. v. Washington]. 384 So. 2d [83.] 
87 [(Ala. 1960)].” Even when a confidential relationship between the parties does not exist, the particular 
circumstances of a situation can give nse to an obligation to disclose. Nn Mann (v. Adams Realty Co.). 556 F.2d 
[2881 297 [(5th Cir. 1977)). lg 6-5-102]. When the accused has supenw knowledge or expertise not shared by the 
plaintiff, the obligation to disclose is compelling. Mann, 556 F.2d at 297 (citing Chapman v. Rivers Constr. Co., 284 Ala. 
633.227 So. 2d 403.410-13 (1969)). Ellis. 409 F. Supp. at 1167-58. In order to determine whether a duty to disclose 
exists, we must examine the facts of each individual case: "a rigid approach is impossible. and. indeed. the words of 
the statute itself counsel flexibility.' Jim Short Ford Sales. 384 So. 20 at 87. Finally, even if one is not under a duty to 
speak. if he decides to do so. "he must make a full and fair disclosure." without concealing any facts within his 
knowledge. Ellis. 409 F. Supp. at 1158 (citing Jackson Co. v. Faulkner. 55 Ala. App. 354. 315 So. 2d 591 (1975)). 
First Ala. Bank of Montgomery, N.A. v. First State Ins. Co., 899 F.2d 1045, 1059 (11th Cir. 
1990). 
19 Jim Walter Homes and Jim Short Ford Sales were overruled on other grounds by State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. 
Owen, 729 So. al 634, 838-42 (Ala. 1998). where the Alabama Supreme Court held that the duty to disclose is a question of 
law to be determined by the Court. Id. ("[W]e hereby overrule that line of cases that gives to the jury the responsibility of 
determining the existence of a duty on the defendant's part."). 
After reviewing the TAC, the undersigned has concluded that the Plaintiff has alleged facts 
giving rise to a confidential and fiduciary relationship between the Plaintiff and BIC. 
triggering a duty to disclose. The Alabama Supreme Court has defined a confidential or 
fiduciary relationship as follows: p48] 
A confidential relationship is one in which one person occupies toward another such a position of adviser or counselor 
as reasonably to inspire confidence that he will act in good faith for the other's interests. or when one person has 
gained the confidence of another and purports to act or advise with the other's interest in mind; where trust and 
confidence are reposed by one person in another who, as a result. gains an influence or superiority over the other: and 
it appears when the circumstances make it certain the parties do not deal on equal terms, but, on the one side, there is 
an overmastering influence. or. on the other, weakness. dependence. or trust, justifiably reposed: in both an unfair 
advantage is possible. It arises in cases in which confidence is reposed and accepted, or influence acquired, and in all 
the variety of relations in which dominion may be exercised by one person over another. 
DGB, LLC v. Hinds, 55 So. 3d 218, 231-32 (Ala. 2010) (quoting Bank of Red Bay, 482 So. 
2d at 284) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Plaintiff alleges that BIC was the Plaintiffs exclusive broker and agent with respect to 
its dealings with Specialty, (doc. 64, §§ 15(c), 18, 71); that BIC "insisted that [the Plaintiff] 
not contact 'Specialty' directly and required [the Plaintiff] ["149] to use [BIC] as the sole 
intermediary between the parties," (id., P72(g)); that, consequently, the Plaintiff bec[a]me 
dependent and reliant on [BIC] for all current and accurate information" as to whether 
Specialty was financially able to perform the transactions at issue, (id.): that BIC informed 
the Plaintiff of BIC's independent dealings with Specialty, including transactions involving
