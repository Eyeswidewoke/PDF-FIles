Make Your Next Dinner Out Even More Rewarding 
American Express is pleased to present the Passport to Dining 
program. You can earn a prepaid Dining Out Card worth $100 when 
you use your American Expresso Card from September 20 through 
November 30, 2006 at four or more participating San Francisco 
restaurants and your receipts add up to at least $400. Using your 
Card helps local AIDS organizations, too. American Express will 
donate 5% of each American Express transaction at participating 
restaurants--up to $50,000 in total--to the Macy's Passport 2006 AIDS 
Organizations. The more of these restaurants you enjoy, the sooner 
you can earn your reward and the more funds you'll help raise for 
HIV/AIDS research, education and patient care.
