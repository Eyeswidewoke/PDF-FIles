from his Capital Account to the extent such Capital Account would otherwise exceed (or be less 
than) his adjusted tax basis in his Interest. 
Such a special allocation may result in the 
withdrawing Partner recognizing income, which may include short-term capital gain and 
ordinary income, in a taxable year in which a withdrawal occurs, thereby potentially reducing the 
amount of long-term capital gain recognized during the tax year in which he receives a 
distribution upon withdrawal. If the General Partner causes such a special allocation to be made, 
the Service might not accept such allocation for tax purposes; if the allocation is successfully 
challenged by the Service, the Partnership's income or losses allocable to the remaining Partners 
would be increased. 
For financial statement presentation and capital account maintenance purposes, all 
securities held by the Partnership will be marked to market at the end of each accounting period 
and the net gain or loss from marking to market will be reported as income or loss. This 
treatment is inconsistent with the general tax rule applicable to many securities transactions that 
a transaction does not result in gain or loss until it is closed by an actual sale or other disposition. 
The divergence between such accounting and tax treatment frequently may result in substantial 
variation between financial statement income (or loss) and taxable income (or loss) reported by 
the Partnership. 
Tax shelter reporting Regulations may require the Partnership and/or the Partners to file 
certain disclosures with the Service with respect to certain transactions engaged in by the 
Partnership or with respect to certain redemptions of Interests in the Partnership. 
The 
Partnership does not consider itself, nor should it be considered, a tax shelter, but if the 
Partnership were to have a substantial loss on certain transactions, such loss may be subject to 
the tax shelter reporting requirements even if such transactions were not considered tax shelters. 
The Partnership intends to provide disclosure information, to the extent required, with the annual 
tax information provided to the Partners. 
Taxation of Partnership Interests - Limitations on Losses and Deductions 
The Code provides several limitations on a Limited Partner's ability to deduct his share 
of Partnership losses and deductions. Certain of these limitations, such as the "passive activity 
loss" rules, likely will not be applicable to the Partnership's operations. To the extent that the 
Partnership has interest expense, a noncorporate Limited Partner will be subject to the 
"investment interest expense" limitations of Section 163(d). Investment interest expense is 
interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry property held 
for investment. The deduction for investment interest expense is limited to net investment 
income, which is the excess of investment income over investment expenses and is determined at 
the partner level. Excess investment interest expense that is disallowed under these rules is not 
lost permanently, but may be carried forward to succeeding years subject to the Section 163(d) 
limitations. Net long-term capital gains on property held for investment and qualified dividend 
income i.e., dividend income which qualifies for the 15% tax bracket) are only included in 
investment income to the extent the taxpayer elects to subject such income to taxation at ordinary 
rates. If the Partnership is considered a trader in securities, which is a question of fact that 
depends on future activities and may vary from year to year, investment interest expense 
deductible by noncorporate Limited Partners under the above rules would be deductible above
