Dodd-Frank Act added a provision, commonly referred to (together with the 
final regulations with respect thereto adopted on December 10, 2013) as the 
Volcker Rule to federal banking laws to generally prohibit various covered 
banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or acquiring or 
retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring or having certain 
relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund (defined in final 
regulations adopted on December 10, 2013 as any entity relying on Section 
3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act to be exempt from 
registration under the Investment Company Act), subject to certain 
exemptions. The Volcker Rule also provides for certain supervised nonbank 
financial companies that engage in such activities or have such interests or 
relationships to be subject to additional capital requirements, quantitative 
limits or other restrictions. The conformance period for the Volcker Rule 
(solely in relation to retaining ownership interests in, and/or sponsoring, 
a collaterized loan obligation vehicle that (i) was in place as of December 
31, 2013 and (ii) would be a "covered fund" as defined under the Volcker 
Rule) will be extended to July 21, 2017. The Issuer intends and expects not 
to be a "covered fund" as defined under the Volcker Rule and will be 
prohibited from acquiring any Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, Senior 
Secured Bonds, Senior Unsecured Bonds or Letters of Credit Reimbursement 
Obligations unless the Volcker Rule Condition has been satisfied. If, 
notwithstanding such intent and expectation, the Issuer is determined to be 
such a "covered fund", this would have a negative effect on the ability or 
desire of certain investors subject to the Volcker Rule to invest in or to 
continue to hold Notes. 
EU risk retention; decreased liquidity in respect of the Notes. Effective 
January 1, 2014, EU Regulation 575/2013 (the CRR) is expected to be 
implemented by national legislation or rulemaking in the other countries in 
the European Economic Area (EEA). CRR Articles 405-407 place certain 
conditions on investments in asset-backed securities by credit institutions 
and investment firms (together referred to as institutions) regulated in EEA 
countries and by affiliates of those institutions. CRR Article 405 requires 
such institutions not to invest in any securitization position (as defined 
in CRR) unless the sponsor, originator or original lender has disclosed to 
investors that it will retain a specified minimum net economic interest in 
the securitization transaction. Prior to investing in a securitization 
position, and on an ongoing basis thereafter, the regulated institution must 
also be able to demonstrate that it has a comprehensive and thorough 
understanding of the securitization transaction and its structural features 
by satisfying the due diligence requirements and ongoing monitoring 
obligations of CRR Article 406. Under CRR Article 407, an institution that 
fails to comply with the requirements of CRR Article 405 or 406 will be 
subject to an additional regulatory capital charge. Article 17 of AIFMD and 
Chapter III, Section 5 of the AIFM Regulation introduced risk retention and 
due diligence requirements (which took effect from July 22, 2013 in general) 
in respect of AIFMs that are required to become authorised under the AIFMD. 
While the requirements applicable to AIFMs under Chapter III, Section 5 of 
the AIFM Regulation are similar to those which apply to credit institutions 
and investment firms under CRR Articles 405-406, they are not identical and, 
in particular, additional due diligence obligations apply to AIFMs.
