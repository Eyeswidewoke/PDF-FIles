Believing in what we do and doing it the right way is what Blue Buffalo is 
all about, so it's no coincidence that we've been able to build a 
dedicated team of like-minded animal lovers as our company has grown. We 
refer to ourselves as "Herd members." We enjoy working in an 
environment where dogs wander freely (our cats prefer to stay at home), and 
we are sharply focused on executing the company's mission of 
educating pet parents and providing high-quality, natural food for their 
dogs and cats. We live by the famous saying that "who you ride the river 
with is just as important as where you're going." There are no "employees" 
at Blue Buffalo_ everyone is a Herd member. Herd members are 
friends and Herd members are part of the Buff team. Our culture is summed up 
by our "N.A. Policy." 
Unlike some of our mega corporation competitors, pet products is the only 
business we're in. When we wake up every morning and come 
to work, dogs and cats are our single focus. And we do everything we can to 
be the best at what we do. 
While we're proud of what we do and the way we do it, there's another side 
to Blue Buffalo that we're just as proud of_our commitment 
to finding a cure for pet cancer. Through our Blue Buffalo Foundation for 
Cancer Research we're sponsoring some critical studies at the top 
veterinary medical schools in the United States. The latest one, which we're 
particularly excited about, is a study that may help advance treatments 
for a type of cancer that affects both dogs and children. I believe we're 
now the #1 supporter of pet cancer awareness and research in the United 
States, which is a fitting tribute to the family member who inspired 
everything we do, our boy Blue. 
In recognition of our IPO and our mission to help find a cure, working with 
our underwriters, Blue Buffalo will be donating $2 million to 
the Blue Buffalo Foundation for Cancer Research. That's on top of $2.4 
million we raised through our fund-raising efforts in 2014, a record 
fundraising year for our cause. 
We also want to give an opportunity to the many loyal pet parents (and 
business associates), who discovered BLUE long before Wall 
Street did, to participate in our IPO. After all, they're a big part of the 
Buff family. So we've partnered with LOYAL3 to allow them to buy shares 
at the same price as Wall Street, with no fees. You can learn more about 
this program in this prospectus. 
And of course, we're not forgetting about the Herd members who have brought 
us to where we are today. Treating Herd members as 
owners has always been an important part of how we've operated, so in 
recognition of our IPO, we will be gifting shares to every one of our Herd 
members (both part-timers and full-timers) who are not part of the 
management team. In addition, we will continue to have long-term incentive 
plans for our management team to make sure they continue to think and act 
like owners and serve our ever growing family in the best possible way. 
We have assembled a leadership team of True Blue Believers, and they have 
what it takes to make this happen.
