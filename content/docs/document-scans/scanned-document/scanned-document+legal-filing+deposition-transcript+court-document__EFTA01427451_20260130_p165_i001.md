Our Strategic Differentiation 
The Landscape We Found 
Pet food in 2002 was an established industry dominated by large CPG 
companies, offering a variety of brands made primarily with 
ingredients such as poultry by-product meals, corn, wheat and soy. Based on 
our conversations with many pet parents, we found that the vast 
majority of them did not read pet food labels and were often unaware of the 
ingredients they were feeding their pets, even though they were seeking 
natural foods and products for themselves and their families. A number of 
small natural pet food brands began to emerge in the neighborhood pet 
stores, led by entrepreneurs who often did not have the funding to build 
sizable businesses. In parallel, the pet food retail landscape had evolved 
significantly with the expansion of national pet superstores. These 
superstores carried a broad assortment of pet products and foods, anchored by 
Engineered brands but did not participate in the emerging Wholesome Natural 
market segment in a meaningful way. 
The BLUE Disruption 
We set out to challenge the status quo set by the incumbent brands. We were 
convinced that the Wholesome Natural market segment 
could become a large part of the industry due to a large unmet consumer 
demand for pet food with high-quality, natural ingredients. We have 
established our leadership position in the Wholesome Natural market segment 
through the strength and quality of our products, by broadly sharing 
our message to encourage pet parents to read ingredient labels and by 
pricing our products at a reasonable premium to Engineered brands. This 
approach was in contrast to our major competitors whose business models were 
tied to the mass production of Engineered brands. 
We committed to creating wholesome pet food made with whole meats, fruits 
and vegetables and other high-quality, natural ingredients 
that we feel good about feeding our own furry family members and to 
educating fellow pet parents about pet nutrition. We further distinguished 
our 
products by creating a two-part dry food, consisting of kibble and our 
trademarked LifeSource Bits that are cold-formed to help preserve the 
potency of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. LifeSource Bits are more 
expensive and complex to manufacture, but we believe they provide 
significant benefits and create a visual point of differentiation when we 
talk to pet parents. We also combined advanced quality control and supply 
chain capabilities generally consistent with the standards required for 
human food industries with our deep expertise in pet foods. We believe these 
competitive advantages, together with our investments in our brand, have 
distinguished us from our smaller competitors in the Wholesome Natural 
market segment. 
We deploy our Pet Detectives, part-time pet-passionate team members, to help 
us fulfill our mission to educate fellow pet parents about 
pet nutrition. Pet Detectives interact with pet parents one-on-one as they 
shop for pet food in specialty stores nationwide and in Canada. Our Pet 
Detective program serves as an educational marketing and sales platform as 
it is a resource for both pet parents already feeding their pets BLUE
