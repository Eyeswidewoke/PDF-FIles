Trust, all legal fees and related expenses incurred in connection with the defense of such legal

and (b) such Trustee shall refund to this Trust any such payments that previously had been made 
if a court enters an order directing that such payments be refunded, or if a court concludes that 
such Trustee acted in bad faith.
