Colleagues cite chief's professionalism, 
►REITER from 1B 
ney's office for two reasons. 
First he pressed for Epstein 
to be charged with the more 
serious crimes of sexual ac. 
thity with minors Second, he 
slammed State Attorney Bars 
ry Kris Cher in blunt language 
seldom used by one law-
orcement official con-
cerning another because of 
what he perceived as that of-
fice's mishandling of the 
cate. 
In a letter to Krischer 
*Ram May 1. Reiter called 
his actions in the Epstein 
case highly unusual" He 
added."' must urge you to ... 
consider if good and suffi-
cient reason exists to require 
your disqualification from the 
prosecution of these cases.' 
.
In short, Reiter told the 
county's top prosecutor for 
the past 13 years that he 
ought to get off the case. 'It 
• looks tike a departure from 
professionalism," Miami. 
Dade State Attorney 
Katherine Fernandez Rundle 
said of Reiter's letter. 
Following Epstein's In-
dictment. Reiter misled the 
case to the FBI to determine 
whether the super-rich, 
super-connected defendant 
had violated any federal laws. 
Reker won't discuss the 
case or the broadsides aimed 
at him. But others almost 
uniformly use one word to 
describe the chiet profes-
sional. 
"I have alwris been im-
pressed by Mice's profes-
sionalism and his leader-
ship," said Rick Lincoln, chief 
of the lantana Police Depart-
ment and a Palm Beach 
County cop for 32 years 
Ike town of Palm Beach 
has a very professional police 
departnent. We all consider 
Mike to be our peer and a 
man of integrity." 
Raker Town 
Manager Peter 
Eked says the 
Palm Beach 
Police enters 
well worth his 
5144,000 sal-
ary. 
Juno Beach Police Chief 
Clark Id agreed. Al-
though he doesn't know Re-
iter well, he has met with him 
on countywide law enforce-
ment issues. "I've never seen 
him lose his cool. I've never 
seen anything but a profes-
sional demeanor from him' 
Reiter Joined the Palm 
Beach Police Department hi 
1981,1eaving a $20,000-oyear 
patrol job at the University of 
Pittsburgh. His personnel 
jacket shows consistently ex-
cellent job evaluations. 
Posh Palm Beach is no 
hotbed of crime, and in his 
first year on the job, a rest-
dent confined to his home 
with a sick child thanked Re-
IterforderwerIng a few Cokes 
to the house. Reiter refused 
payment for the beverages. 
Another resident thanked 
Reiter for shutting off his 
car's headlights in his drive-
way, saying a valet must have 
been at fault

from road patrol to oiganized
crime, vice and narcotics.

gations involving the island's

drug overdose death of David 
Kennedy in 1584. He also was 
one of the officers who 
worked the investigation of 
William Kennedy Smith, who 
was charged in 1991 — and 
later acquitted —with raping 
a woman at the Kennedy 
family compound in Palm 
Beach.
