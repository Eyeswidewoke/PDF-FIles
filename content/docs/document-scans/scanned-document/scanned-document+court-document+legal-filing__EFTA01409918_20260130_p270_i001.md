Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Agreements with Named Executive Officers 
Lawrence J. Johnson 
On July 20, 2012, we entered into an Amended and Restated Employment 
Agreement with Lawrence J. Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer. 
The initial term of Mr. Johnson's employment agreement expires on December 
31, 2015, unless earlier terminated by us or Mr. Johnson. The 
agreement provides for automatic one-year renewals, unless either we or Mr. 
Johnson give notice of our or his intention not to extend at least 90 
days prior to the expiration of any term. Under his employment agreement, 
Mr. Johnson receives a minimum annual base salary of $700,000. 
Mr. Johnson is also eligible to receive an annual performance bonus each 
year, if budget and performance goals established by our board of 
directors are met, and is entitled to participate in customary benefit plans. 
If we terminate Mr. Johnson's employment without cause, or if Mr. Johnson 
resigns for good reason, he will be entitled to the following: 
(i) payment of (x) accrued compensation and unpaid base salary through the 
date of such termination, (y) any amounts previously deferred by 
Mr. Johnson and (z) the payment or reimbursement for expenses incurred prior 
to the date of such termination; (ii) an amount equal to two times 
the sum of (x) base salary plus (y) all annual bonus and annual performance 
bonus paid or payable for the fiscal year immediately preceding the 
fiscal year in which such termination of employment occurs; and (iii) 
continued participation, at our expense, in our health and welfare programs 
for a period of two years after the date of termination. Any payments in 
accordance with (ii) above shall be paid in cash at the following times: 50% 
within 30 days following the termination date, 25% on the six-month 
anniversary of the termination date and the remaining 25% on the 12-month 
anniversary of the termination date. 
For purposes of Mr. Johnson's employment agreement with us, a termination 
for cause will be deemed to have occurred upon the happening 
of the following, subject to a cure right: (i) his misappropriation or theft 
of our or any of our subsidiary's funds or property; (ii) his conviction or 
entering of a plea of nolo contendere of any fraud, misappropriation, 
embezzlement or similar act, felony or crime involving dishonesty or moral 
turpitude; (iii) his engagement in any conduct that is materially injurious 
to us; (iv) his material breach of his employment agreement or material 
failure to perform any of his duties owed to us; or (v) his commission of 
any act involving willful malfeasance or gross negligence or his failure to 
act involving material nonfeasance. 
Under Mr. Johnson's employment agreement with us, good reason means the 
following: (i) our assignment to Mr. Johnson of any duties that 
are materially inconsistent with his position, authority, duties or 
responsibilities or any actions by us that result in a material diminution 
in his 
position, authority, duties or responsibilities, subject to a 30-day 
remedial period; (ii) our material breach of Mr. Johnson's employment 
agreement, 
which breach remains uncured for 10 days; (iii) any reduction of Mr. 
Johnson's base salary or bonus amount, unless such reduction is applied to
