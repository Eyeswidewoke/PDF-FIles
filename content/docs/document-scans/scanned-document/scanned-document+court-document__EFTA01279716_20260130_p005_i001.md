systems, components, instruments and other equipment incorporated in, or installed on, the Equipment 
which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged 
beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever. In addition, in the 
ordinary course of maintenance, service repair, overhaul or testing, Borrower may remove any parts, 
whether or not worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or 
permanently rendered unfit for use, provided that Borrower shall replace such parts as promptly as 
practicable. All replacement parts shall be free and clear of all Liens (as defined in Section 6(c)) and shall 
be in as good an operating condition as, and shall have a value and utility at least equal to, the parts 
replaced, assuming such replaced parts were in the condition and repair required to be maintained by the 
terms hereof. Any replacement part installed, or incorporated on, the Equipment shall be considered an 
accession to such Equipment. 
(c) 
Borrower will keep the Equipment and its interest therein free and clear of all 
liens, claims, mortgages, charges and encumbrances of any type regardless of how arising ("Liens") other 
than the Lien of the Lender hereunder. If any Lien shall attach to any Equipment, Borrower will provide 
written notification to Lender within five (5) days after Borrower receives notice of any such attachment 
stating the full particulars thereof and the location of such Equipment on the date of such notification. 
(d) 
At its sole option, Borrower may make any alteration, modification or attachment 
to the Equipment deemed appropriate by Borrower, provided that such alteration, modification, 
attachment is of a type which is readily removable without damage to the Equipment, does not decrease 
the value, condition, utility or useful life of the Equipment or cause such Equipment to become a fixture 
(as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction), or real property or 
affect the insurability or impair any manufacturer's warranty with respect to the Equipment. All alterations, 
modifications and attachments of whatsoever kind or nature made to any Equipment that cannot be 
removed without damaging or reducing the functional capability, economic value or insurability of the 
Equipment or impairing any manufacturer's warranty shall only be made with the prior written consent of 
the Lender and shall be deemed to be part of the Equipment and subject to the Lien of this Agreement. 
Under no circumstance shall any alteration, modification or attachment be subjected by Borrower to any 
encumbrance other than the Lien of the Lender hereunder.

use or operation of the Equipment in amounts acceptable to Lender. All insurance against loss shall 
name Lender as the sole loss payee and all liability insurance shall name Lender and its successors and 
assignees and their subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and their successors and assigns as additional 
insureds. All of such insurance shall be in form (including all endorsements required by Lender), and with 
companies, reasonably satisfactory to Lender.

of set-off or right of contribution from any other insurance carried by the Lender; (iv) contain breach of

invalidated by any action, inaction or breach of warranty, declaration, or condition by Borrower or any 
other person or by any fact or information known to Lender; and (v) waive any right of subrogation against 
Lender. 
(c)
