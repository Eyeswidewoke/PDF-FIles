Defaults; Market and Credit Spread Volatility. To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral 
Obligation and the Issuer sells or otherwise disposes of that Collateral Obligation, it is likely that the proceeds will 
be less than its unpaid principal and interest or its purchase price. This could have a material adverse effect on the 
payments on the Securities. The Issuer also may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek 
recovery after a default or participate in the restructuring of an obligation. Even in the absence of a default with 
respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the market value of the Collateral Obligation at any time will vary, and 
may vary substantially, from the price at which that Collateral Obligation was initially purchased and from the 
principal amount of such Collateral Obligation, due to market volatility, changes in relative credit quality. 
availability of financial information and remedies under the Underlying Instruments of such Collateral Obligation. 
general economic conditions, the level of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, the supply of below investment 
grade debt obligations and other factors that are difficult to predict. In addition, the Indenture places significant 
restrictions on the Investment Manager's ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations. 
The market price of below investment grade debt obligations may from time to time experience significant volatility. 
During certain periods, this market has experienced significant volatility with respect to market prices, including as 
a result of recent deterioration of the subprime mortgage industry' in the U.S. and asset-backed securities backed by 
U.S. mortgage collateral, a significant increase in issues trading at distressed levels, a significant increase in default 
rates, and a significant decrease in recovery rates. No assurance can be given as to the levels of volatility in the 
below investment grade debt market in the future. Such volatility may adversely impact the liquidity, market prices 
and other performance characteristics of the Collateral Obligations. 
In addition to default frequency. recovery• rate and market price volatility. Leveraged Loans may experience 
volatility in the spread that is paid on such Leveraged Loans. Such spreads will vary• based on a variety of factors, 
including, but not limited to. the level of supply and demand in the Leveraged Loan market, general economic 
conditions, levels of relative liquidity for Leveraged Loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the 
Leveraged Loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings and the methodology used by credit rating 
agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the Leveraged Loan market. 
Since Leveraged Loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such Leveraged Loans 
would be expected to prepay or refinance such Leveraged Loans if alternative financing were available at a lower 
cost. For example. if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded. the obligor were recapitalized or if credit 
spreads were declining for Leveraged Loans. such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. 
The rates at which Collateral Obligations may prepay or refinance and the level of credit spreads for Leveraged 
Loans in the future are subject to numerous factors and are difficult to predict. Declining credit spreads in the 
Leveraged Loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refmancings will likely result in a reduction of 
portfolio yield and interest collections on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the 
amount available for distributions on Notes. beginning with the Subordinated Securities as the most junior Classes. 
Illiquidity of Collateral. The lack of an established, liquid secondary market for some of the Collateral Obligations 
may have an adverse effect on the market value of the Collateral Obligations and on the Issuer's ability to dispose of 
them. The market for below investment grade debt obligations may become illiquid from time to time as a result of 
adverse market conditions, regulatory developments or other circumstances. Additionally, Collateral Obligations 
will be subject to certain other transfer restrictions that may contribute to illiquidity. Therefore, no assurance can be 
given that. if the Issuer determined to dispose of all or a substantial portion of a particular investment, it could 
dispose of such investment, particularly at an previously prevailing market price or any specific valuation level. 
Securities Lending. The Collateral Obligations may be loaned to counterpanies such as banks, broker-dealers or 
other financial institutions. In the event that the related counterparty defaults on its obligation to return loaned 
Collateral Obligations. because of insolvency or otherwise. the Trustee could experience delays and costs in gaining 
access to any collateral posted by the counterparty. The realized value of such collateral could be less than the 
amount required to purchase the loaned Collateral Obligations in the open market. Either Rating Agency may 
downgrade the Rated Notes if the Issuer is no longer in compliance with the securities lending counterparty 
guidelines described herein. The loaned Collateral Obligations will not be available to fund payments on the 
Securities. The Initial Purchaser, the Irwestment Manager and/or any of their respective Affiliates may borrow 
Collateral Obligations from the Issuer. 
Credit Ratings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold a security, and it may be subject to 
revisions or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Credit ratings of debt obligations represent the
