their testimony. Any and ull communications between the federal authorities and the alleged 
"victims" and witnesses in this matter has the ability to influence the reliability of the testimony 
obtained and the validity of the civil settlements that result. 
Thus. there is still a real concern that some of the statements that federal prosecutors 
relied upon in its prosecution of this mailer may have been tainted. An inquiry is required to 
confirm that at the time witness statements were given, there were no communications made by 
federal agents regarding potential civil remedies. The government should not provide promises 
of guaranteed monetary settlements to encourage cooperation because they run the risk of 
seriously tainting the reliability of witness statements. While we by no means are accusing your 
Office of making improper communications at this point the filet that the award of a civil 
settlement without any requirement to prove liability, is available to the identified individuals, 
raises cause for concern us to the nature of all communications that are made to the 'victims.' 
You previously stated that the USAO's main objective with respect to the Section 2255 
component of the Agreement was to "placc.the victims in the same position as they would have 
been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial." However, to accomplish this goal, your Office 
rejected using traditional terms that allow for the restitution of victims. Instead. your Office 
chose to insert itself into the negotiations. settlement, and potential litigation of a civil suit. With 
all due respect we object to your Office's attempt to make the victims whole by requiring that 
Mr. Epstein deprive himself of rights accorded to him as a potential civil defendant. While we 
arc aware. one of the responsibilities of your Office is to provide for restitution for victims of 
crimes, this does not give the government the responsibility to enable alleged victims to collect a 
civil settlement. 
Despite this concern, it should also be noted that, the Agreement. both as written and as 
interpreted by your Office significantly enlarges the victims' ability to recover from Mr. Lipstein. 
For instance, if the individuals attempted to litigate against Mr. Epstein_ they would have been 
determined to be victims only after a lengthy trial, in which they would have been thoroughly 
deposed. their credibility tested and their statements subject to cross-examination. 
The 
defendant, under these circumstances, would not have had pay the plaintiffs' legal fees. 
Moreover, these individuals would face significant evidentiary hurdles, unwanted publicity, and 
most importantly. no certainty of success on the merits. Therefore. the notion that your Office is 
merely attempting to restore these - victims" to the same position as they would have been had 
Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial misunderstands the Agreement and your Offices 
implementation of its terms.
