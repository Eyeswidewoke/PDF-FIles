ated therein or otherwise, the "Master Agreement") and it is a requirement of the Master Agreement t 
hat the Obligor deliver this Guaranty for Obligor's obligations under the Master Agreement to the Ba

ent when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of the full amount of any and all obligations an 
d liabilities, direct or contingent, joint, several or independent, now or hereafter existing, due o

he obligations and liabilities of the Obligor, changed, extended, renewed, modified, amended, supple 
mented or altered in any manner, (ii) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the 0
