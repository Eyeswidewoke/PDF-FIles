value of the relevant assets on the date of such distribution, allocation, or division, whichever 
first occurs. My Trustees shall appropriately adjust such fractions to reflect the effect of any 
partial distributions, allocations, or divisions, taking into account the fair market value as of the 
date of distribution, allocation, or division, whichever first occurred, of the assets so distributed, 
allocated, or divided. 
B. 
My Trustees shall value any assets distributed, allocated, or divided to 
satisfy (in whole or in part) a pecuniary distribution at the fair market value of such assets on 
the date of such distribution, allocation, or division, whichever first occurs. 
Section 5.4. - Accounting Allocations 
A. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement and except 
as provided in Paragraph B of this Section 5.4, my Trustees shall allocate receipts and 
disbursements in accordance with sound trust accounting principles and have discretion to 
allocate receipts and disbursements when, in the judgment of my Trustees, the treatment is 
uncertain under applicable laws or generally accepted accounting principles. 
B. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, my Trustees 
shall not treat any part of the principal amount of the proceeds of sale of any asset of any trust 
as income distributable to or for the benefit of any beneficiary entitled to distributions of income; 
provided, however, that my Trustees shall treat a portion of any proceeds of sale of any financial 
instrument originally issued or acquired at a discount equal to the amount which (1) has 
previously been characterized as ordinary income for income tax purposes or (2) will be 
characterized as ordinary income for income tax purposes in the year of such sale, as income for 
trust accounting purposes. 
Section 5.5. - Spendthrift Provision 
During the term of any trust hereunder, no money or other assets (either principal or 
income) payable or distributable under the provisions of this Agreement shall be pledged, 
assigned, transferred, given, conveyed, hypothecated, sold, anticipated, charged, or encumbered 
by any of the Beneficiaries hereunder, nor shall the income and principal of any trust, while in 
the possession of my Trustees, be liable for any debts, contracts, obligations, or undertakings of 
such Beneficiaries, voluntary or involuntary, or for any claims or judgments against any 
Beneficiary, including claims for alimony or for the support of any Beneficiary's spouse or 
children, or for reimbursement of a federal, state or local government, or any agency of any 
federal, state, or local government, for the support of any Beneficiary hereunder, prior to the 
time such money or assets are actually paid or distributed to such Beneficiary. Any attempted 
pledge, assignment, transfer, gift, conveyance, hypothecation, anticipation, charge, or 
encumbrance of any money or assets (either income or principal) payable or distributable under 
the provisions of this Agreement by any of the Beneficiaries hereunder prior to the time such 
money or assets are actually paid or distributed to such Beneficiary shall be null and void and 
shall not be recognized by my Trustees. This Section 5.5 of Article V shall not apply to me.
