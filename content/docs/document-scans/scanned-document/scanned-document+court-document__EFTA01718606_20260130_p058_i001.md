As I mcnlioncd over the telephone. 1 cannot bind 11w girls to the Trust Agreement. and I don't 
think it is appropriate that a state court would administer u must that seeks to pay fin lbdemleivil 
claims. We both want to avoid unrcrupdous attarmv undone lirip,atus from contIngfurward. and 
1 know that .wur client wanix to keep these miters /onside cfpublle court filingv, but I just don't 
have the power m do what you ask. Here is my recommendation. During the period between Mr. 
Epstein 's pin and sentencing. I make a motion for appointment or the Guardian Ad Litem. Tlw 
three of us sit down and discuss things, and / x111 fitedthae its much as / can getting the girls' 
apprmwl of this pmeedure because. as I Maalamit 
Ihia It At probably in dome best tmerests. 
In terms of plen agreement language, let me suggest the Ibllowing: 
The tinned Stales agrees to make a motion seeking the appointment of a Guardian ad Ulm to 
nmresent the identified victims. Following the oppniniment of such Guardian, the panics agree to 
work together in good faith to develop a Trust Agreement, subject to the Court's approval. that 
would provide tier any damages owed to the identifies' victims pursuant in IN U.S.C. Section 
2255. Then include the lust two sentences of your paragraph it. 
See email from Villafana to Letkowith dated September 16. 2007 (emphasis added). I lowever. 
notably. in the draft agreement that follows. Ms. Villathna keeps the same objectionable 
language and only adds a portion or what was suggested in her communication to us: 
Epstein agrees that. if any of the victims identified in the federal investigation file suit pursuant 
m IS U.S.C. § 2255. Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Corm fur the 
Southern District of Florida over his person andfor the subject matter, and Epstein will not comma 
that the identified victims are persons who. while minors,. were victims of violations or Title 18, 
United Stores Code, Sections(s) 2422 and/or 2423. 
The United States shall provide Epstein's attorneys with a list of the identified victims, which 
will not exceed forty. alter Epstein has signed this agreement and has been sentenced. The 
United States shall make a motion with the United States District Court lbr the Southern District 
of Florida fur the appointment of a guardian ud !item for the identified victims and Epstein 's 
counsel may contact the 'dignified victims through that counsel. 
See draft non-prosecution agreement c-mailed from Villafana to Lclkowitz dated September It 
2007. The inclusion of a guardian ad liumt. however, only served to complicate matters. We 
continued to reiterate our objections to the inclusion of 2255 in the Agreement repeatedly. as 
evidenced in an email from Ms. Villafana to myself on September 23. 2005 where she writes: 
"we have been over paragraph 6 jthe then relevant 2255 paragraph I an infinite number of times." 
During negotiatioms, it was decided that an attorney representative be appointed in the place of a 
guardian ad litem — not for the sake of litigating claims. but based on the belief that a guardian 
ad litem would not be appropriate ibr adults that are capable of making their own decisions. 
I lowever. the IlSAD included into the Agreement that we pay for the attorney representative —
when originally Ms. Villalana stated that 11w representative could be paid for by us or the federal 
court. See c-mail from Villafana to Lclkowitz doted September 23. 2007.
