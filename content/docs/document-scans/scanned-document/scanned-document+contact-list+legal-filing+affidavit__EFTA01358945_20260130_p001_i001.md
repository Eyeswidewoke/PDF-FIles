commerce. And to state a RICO conspiracy, a plaintiff must allege the existence of an 
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions.

[HN6] 18 U.S.C.S. § 1961(1) sets forth an exhaustive list of predicate acts that can 
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, including 18 U.S.C.S. §§ 1341 and 1343 (mail 
and wire fraud, respectively).

[HN7] The elements of mail or wire fraud are (i) a scheme to defraud (ii) to get money or 
property (iii) furthered by the use of interstate mail or wires. The gravamen of the offense is 
the scheme to defraud. A scheme to defraud is a plan to deprive a person of something of 
value by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching. To make out such a scheme, a plaintiff 
must provide proof of a material misrepresentation.

[HN8] The elements of mail and wire fraud must be pled with particularity. The complaint 
must detail the specific statements that are false or fraudulent, identify the speaker, state 
when and where the statements were made, and explain why the statements were 
fraudulent.

[HN9] The mail or wire communications themselves need not contain a false statement. 
When alleging use of the mail and wires, the pleader need only allege that the mail and 
wire fraud were in furtherance of a larger scheme to defraud and the communications 
themselves need not have contained false or misleading information. A detailed 
description of the underlying scheme and the connection therewith of the mail and/or wire 
communications is sufficient to satisfy Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). But a plaintiff still needs to 
allege a material misrepresentation as part of the defendants' scheme to fraud to state a 
violation of 18 U.S.C.S. § 1341 or 1343. That is so notwithstanding characterization of the 
alleged frauds as predicate acts of a racketeering conspiracy.
