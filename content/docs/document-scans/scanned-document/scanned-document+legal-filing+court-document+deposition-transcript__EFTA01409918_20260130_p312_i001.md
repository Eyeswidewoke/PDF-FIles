Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
• the non-US holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 
days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other 
conditions are met, in which case the gain (net of certain US-source losses) 
generally will be subject to US federal income tax at a rate 
of 30% (or a lower treaty rate); or 
• we are or have been a United States real property holding corporation (as 
described below), at any time within the five-year period 
preceding the disposition or the non-US holder's holding period, whichever 
period is shorter, and either (i) our common stock is not 
regularly traded on an established securities market prior to the beginning 
of the calendar year in which the sale or disposition occurs or 
(ii) the non-US holder has owned or is deemed to have owned, at any time 
within the five-year period preceding the disposition or the 
non-US holder's holding period, whichever period is shorter, more than 5% of 
our common stock. 
We will be a United States real property holding corporation at any time 
that the fair market value of our "United States real property 
interests," as defined in the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations, 
equals or exceeds 50% of the aggregate fair market value of our worldwide 
real property interests and our other assets used or held for use in a trade 
or business. We believe that we are not, and do not anticipate becoming in 
the foreseeable future, a United States real property holding corporation. 
Information Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding 
Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments 
of dividends and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of 
common stock. A non-US holder may have to comply with certification 
procedures to establish that it is not a United States person in order to 
avoid information reporting and backup withholding requirements. The 
certification procedures required to claim a reduced rate of withholding 
under a treaty will satisfy the certification requirements necessary to 
avoid backup withholding as well. The amount of any backup withholding 
from a payment to a non-US holder will be allowed as a credit against the 
non-US holder's US federal income tax liability and may entitle the nonUS 
holder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to 
the IRS in a timely manner. 
FATCA Withholding Taxes 
Payments to certain foreign entities of dividends on, and the gross proceeds 
of, dispositions of common stock of a US issuer will be subject to 
a withholding tax (separate and apart from, but without duplication of, the 
withholding tax described above) at a rate of 30%, unless various US 
information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to 
ownership by US persons of interests in or accounts with those entities) 
have been satisfied or an exemption from these rules applies. The IRS has 
announced that Treasury Regulations implementing this withholding tax 
will defer the withholding obligation until January 1, 2017 for gross 
proceeds from dispositions of common stock of a US issuer. An 
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable 
foreign country may modify these requirements. Non-US holders should 
consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this
