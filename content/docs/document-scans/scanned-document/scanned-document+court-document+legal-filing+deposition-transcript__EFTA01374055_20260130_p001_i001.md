Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated 
Morgan Stanley acts as a prime broker and custodian to the Master Fund pursuant to the terms 
and conditions of a Customer Prime Broker Account Agreement (together with the Annexes and 
Schedules thereto) dated December 31, 2002, (the `Morgan Stanley Prime Brokerage 
Agreement"). 
In accordance with applicable US law, including but not limited to, the rules and regulations of the 
SEC, all of the assets of the Master Fund are held in the name of the Master Fund and beneficial 
ownership thereof is recorded on the books of Morgan Stanley as belonging to the Master Fund. 
The rules of the SEC require that Morgan Stanley holds all fully-paid and excess margin customer 
securities either physically or in a control location. To the extent of applicable US law, such 
securities and cash will generally not be available to the creditors of Morgan Stanley. 
Morgan Stanley has a security interest in all securities and other property of the Master Fund that 
are held in an account at Morgan Stanley or its affiliates to secure the payment and performance 
by the Master Fund of its obligations to Morgan Stanley and its affiliates. With respect to Morgan 
Stanley, all of the Master Fund's securities, commodities or other property in Morgan Stanley's or 
its affiliates possession may from time to time (without notice to the Master Fund) be pledged, 
hypothecated or re-hypothecated, separately or in combination with other securities, commodities 
or other property, in which event the Master Fund will only have a right to the return of equivalent 
assets. 
However, any such pledging, hypothecation or re-hypothecation by Morgan Stanley is subject to 
the applicable rules of the SEC (including, without limitation, Rule 15c3-3 promulgated under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) which limits the amount Morgan Stanley can pledge, 
hypothecate or re-hypothecate to an amount up to but not exceeding 140% of the Master Fund's 
margin debit balance.
