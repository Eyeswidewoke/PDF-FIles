sources that gave rise to the scalp maps at — 100 ms (the highest 
percentage of reconstruction contribution), we correlated the fifteen 
best sensors with the sources estimated by sLORETA. After weighting 
the CCs by the vector magnitudes of the sensor weights, the top 5% 
were binary-thresholded and plotted on an axial slice (Fig. 5C). In all 
phases of the task the contralateral precentral gyrus (PIG) and 
postcentral gyrus ( PoG) and the ipsilateral superior parietal lobule 
(SPL) and precuneus (Ku) encoded for hand velocity. The contral-
ateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and ipsilateral medial frontal gyrus. 
containing the supplementary motor area (SMA). additionally 
encoded for hand velocity in all phases except pre-exposure. Finally 
the lateral premotorconex of the bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) 
and ipsilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) ) were involved in hand 
velocity encoding only in early- and post-exposure. 
Discussion 
Our results demonstrate that we can continuously decode 
information about hand velocity from natural, multi-joint, center-
out movements from MEG signals collected during a drawing task that 
requires visuomotor adaptation to a hand-cursor rotation. With the 
systematic addition of sensors to the decoding model, the decoding 
accuracy exponentially increases before reaching a plateau. Addition-
ally, a macroscale sensorimotor network composed of central and 
posterior scalp regions encodes for hand velocity in all phases of 
adaptation, and the differences in MEG sensor importance between 
phases capture the evolution of cortical involvement during adapta-
tion. Furthermore, localization of cortical sources permits a more 
detailed investigation into the conical regions that encode for hand 
velocity in different adaptation phases. 
Hand velocity information is represented on multiple spatial scales 
Researchers have firmly established the existence of a population 
code for hand position and velocity at the microscale level via 
neuronal recordings (Georgopoulos et at.. 1986: Kettner et al.. 1988: 
van Hemmen and Schwartz. 2008). Recently, some electrocortico-
graphy (ECoG) studies demonstrated that a population code for these 
kinematic parameters also exists on a mesoscale (Schalk et al. 2007: 
Pistohl et al. 2008: Sanchez et al. 2008).The most striking result of our 
study is that a sensorimotor network on a larger spatial scale encodes 
hand kinematics during natural, multi-joint center-out movements. 
and. furthermore, does so during adaptation to a screen cursor-hand 
rotation. In sensor space, this network spans central and posterior 
sensor areas. Each MEG sensor reflects the contributions of millions of 
neurons. but yet, we can still decode information about hand velocity. 
Further regarding spatial scale, we asked whether a denser sampling 
of the scalp space could improve decoding accuracy. Since the curves of 
mean CC vs. the number of sensors reveal there to bean optimal, or near 
optimal, number of sensors less than 62 for all phases of the task 
(Fig. 4), we conclude that the addition of more sensors would not 
substantially improve the decoding accuracy. The decreased mean 
decoding accuracy and increased SD of the CC during post-exposure is 
likely due to the relatively small amount of data collected and analyzed 
during this phase of the task The overall increased mean decoding 
accuracy of y velocity during adaptation was potentially due to the fact 
that, during exposure, the 60-degree rotation had a greater affect on 
hand movement in they direction than the x direction, and thus may 
have recruited more neural resources to handle the y direction 
(Contreras-Vidal and Kerick, 2004). 
Several interesting pieces of evidence serve to validate the 
interpretation of our decoding results. First. the greatest sensor 
contributions across time lags occur at 100 ms prior to the current 
kinematic sample under reconstruction for all phases of the task 
(Fig. SA). Given that prior research has established approximately 
100 ms of neural data in the past to be important for planning the 
current movement (Mehring et al.. 2004: Paninski et al., 2003), this 
finding is not unexpected. In our previous report leading up to this 
study (Bradberry et al.. 2008). we discovered that hand velocity was 
better decoded than position (post-publication analysis: two-tailed, 
paired t-test; p<0.0001). This is another confirmatory finding, given 
that the motor cortex represents velocity better than position as has 
been demonstrated, in particular, by studies aimed at decoding 
kinematic parameters for neuroprosthetic control (Schwartz et al.. 
2001). Furthermore, the salient region of high activation over the left 
motor area is expected since subjects drew with their right hands. 
Regional comparison to non-decoding studies of visuomotor adaptation 
In sensor space, across adaptation we find significant contributions 
to hand velocity decoding over the mediolateral premotor and 
posterior parietal scalp areas with respect to pre-exposure (Fig. 58). 
Previous studies demonstrated that the parietal and premotor cortices 
are involved in a visuomotor network for reaching (Wise et al.. 1997; 
Burnod et al.. 1999), and an EEG study of visuomotor adaptation 
reported fronto-parietal shifts (Contreras-Vidal and Kerick. 2004). To 
speak more specifically about the conical areas involved with 
visuomotor adaptation and encoding of hand kinematics, we 
performed source localization (Fig. 5C). Multiple similarities exist 
between the conical regions found in our study and those of fMRI and 
PET studies of visuomotor adaptation. The left PrG. PoG. and IPL have 
been shown to be involved during visuomotor adaptation to a rotation 
of visual feedback by a IMRI studies by Graydon et al. (2005) and 
Seidler et al. (2006;. In KT studies, the right SPL has been observed to 
increase in activation during visuomotor adaptation tasks by loom. 
et al. (2000). Ghilardi et al. (20001, and Krakauer et al. (2004). Inoue 
et al.. Krakauer et al„ and Seidler et al. have also revealed an 
increase in activation of SMA/preSMA during visuomotor adapta-
tion. Finally the MFG and SFG (lateral premotor cortex) have been 
shown to be active in visuomotor adaptation by Inoue et al. and 
Seidler et al. 
Regional comparison to other decoding studies 
Regarding decoding of hand kinematics. the common involvement 
across tasks of the PrG. PoG, Sit and PCu implies that these areas form 
the core for hand velocity encoding in familiar and unfamiliar 
environments while the SMA, lateral premotor cortex. and IPL encode 
for hand velocity only during adaptation. Decoding of hand kinematics 
has been reported for PrG and PoG at a microscale (Georgopoulos 
et 4..1986; Moran and Schwartz. 1999; Wessberg et al.. 2000; Serruya 
et al.. 2002; Schwartz et al., 2004), mesoscale (Schalk et al.. 2007; 
Pistohl et al. 2008: Sanchez et al. 2008). and macroscale (Jerbi et al., 
2007). This decoding role has also been ascribed to the SPL at the 
microscale (Averbeck et al., 2005. 2009: Mulliken et al., 2008) and 
macroscale (Jerbi et al., 2007). The SMA/preSMA. lateral premotor 
cortex, and IPL have also been observed to encode movement 
kinematics (Moran and Schwartz. 1999; Schwartz et al.. 2004; Jerbi 
et al., 2007: Tankus et al.. 2009). On a slightly different note, a PET 
study that examined the control of movement velocity, discovered the 
involvement of left PrG, left PoG. right SPI... and mediolateral premotor 
cortex (turner et al., 1998). To our knowledge, we are the first to 
report that the PCu plays a role in the encoding of detailed hand 
kinematics. 
Could eye movements haw inadvertently aided hand velocity decoding? 
Unintended contributions of eye movements to the decoding of 
hand movement is a potential confound in all MEG. EEG, and ECoG 
studies, including our study. We did not experimentally control eye 
movements; however, there is reason to conclude that they do not 
subvert our interpretations. In an ancillary analysis ( Sul) *mental)?
