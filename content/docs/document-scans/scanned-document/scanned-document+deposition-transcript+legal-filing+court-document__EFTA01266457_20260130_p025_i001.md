accountings by Trustees. Furthermore, pursuant to Section 1107, Title 15, of the Virgin Islands 
Code, I hereby relieve my Trustees and any successor Trustees, to the extent allowable, from 
any and all duties, restrictions, and liabilities which would otherwise be imposed upon my 
Trustees by Chapter 57, Title 15, Virgin Islands Code. This Section 7.7 of this Article VII shall 
not be deemed a waiver of any and all other rights, powers, or restrictions otherwise granted to 
my Trustees in this Agreement. 
Article VIII 
Miscellaneous Provisions 
Section 8.1. - Representation of Person Under a Disability 
To the extent allowed by law, where a party to any proceeding with respect to any trust 
hereunder has the same interest as a person under a disability, legal process shall not be required 
on the person under a disability. 
Section 8.2. - Simultaneous Deaths 
If a Beneficiary under this Agreement and I die simultaneously or under such 
circumstances that it is difficult to determine who died first, then for all purposes of this 
Agreement such Beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me. 
Section 8.3. - Law Governing 
This Agreement and each trust created by it shall in all respects and for all purposes be 
governed and regulated by the laws of the Territory of the United States Virgin Islands, as they 
now exist and may from time to time be enacted, amended, or repealed. All questions regarding 
the validity, construction and administration of this Agreement, or any of its provisions, and of 
any trust created by it shall be determined solely by the laws of that Territory. The courts of the 
State of Delaware and the U.S. Virgin Islands shall have primary supervision over the 
administration of each trust created by this Agreement. It is intended that each such trust shall 
be a U.S. domestic trust as defined in Title 26 section 7701(a)(30) of the Code by virtue of 
meeting the court and control test. As provided in Treas Reg. section 301.770 I -7(c)(4)(D), 
if both a United States court and a foreign court are able to exercise primary supervision over 
the administration of the trust, the trust meets the court test. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, my Trustees of each trust 
created under this Agreement have discretion at any time or times following my death to transfer 
the situs of such trust to such other country, or such other jurisdiction as my Trustees determine, 
without obtaining judicial authorization or approval (unless such judicial authorization or 
approval is required by applicable law) and without the filing of any bond. My Trustees' 
determination to transfer the situs of any trust under this Agreement shall be evidenced by an 
instrument in writing signed, witnessed and acknowledged by my Trustees in the same manner 
as would be required for a deed. My Trustees are authorized to take whatever actions are 
necessary to effect such a transfer of situs. If judicial authorization or approval is required to 
effect such a transfer of situs, I intend and desire that the appropriate court accept the 
determination of my Trustees concerning the transfer of the situs of such trust even if one or
