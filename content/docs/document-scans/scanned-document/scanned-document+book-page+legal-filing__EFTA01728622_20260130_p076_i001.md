■ child- or youth-oriented decorations 
■ video, film, and digital photography equipment 
■ alcohol and drugs 
Costumes include those worn by the offender and children. Toys, games, drugs, 
and alcohol can all be used as part of the seduction process to lower inhibitions. 
Dolls of varying sizes and types can also be used for simulated and autoerotic 
sexual activity. The photography equipment may be hidden in such a way as to 
surreptitiously record children performing acts such as going to the bathroom or 
undressing. Computers constitute a potential gold mine of evidence and will be 
discussed in more detail in the chapter titled "Use of Computers by Sex Offend-
ers" beginning on page 89.

It is difficult to know with certainty why preferential sex offenders collect theme 
pornography and related paraphernalia. There may be as many reasons as there 
are offenders. Collecting this material may help them satisfy, deal with, or rein-
force their compulsive, persistent sexual fantasies. Some child erotica is collected 
as a substitute for preferred but unavailable or illegal child pornography. 
Collecting may also fulfill needs for validation. Many preferential sex offend-
ers collect academic and scientific books and articles on the nature of their 
paraphilic preferences in an effort to understand and justify their own behavior. 
For the same reason pedophiles often collect and distribute articles and manuals 
written by pedophiles in which they attempt to justify and rationalize their 
behavior. In this material pedophiles share techniques for finding and seducing 
children and avoiding or dealing with the criminal-justice system. Preferential 
sex offenders get passive validation from the books and articles they read and 
collect. 
Many preferential sex offenders swap pornographic images the way boys swap 
baseball cards. As they add to their collections they get strong reinforcement from 
each other for their behavior. The collecting and trading process becomes a com-
mon bond. Preferential sex offenders get active validation from other offenders, 
some victims, and occasionally from undercover law-enforcement officers oper-
ating "sting" operations. The Internet makes getting active validation easier than 
ever before. Fear of discovery or identification causes some offenders to settle 
only for passive validation. 
The need for validation may also partially explain why some preferential sex 
offenders compulsively and systematically save the collected material. It is almost 
as though each hour spent on the Internet and each communication and image is 
evidence of the value and legitimacy of their behavior. For example one offender 
sends another offender a letter or E-mail enclosing photographs and describing 
his sexual activities with children. At the letter's or E-mail's conclusion he asks the 
recipient to destroy the letter or E-mail because it could be damaging evidence 
against him. Six months later law enforcement finds the letter or E-mail—care-
fully filed as part of the offender's organized' collection. Offenders' need for 
validation is the foundation on which proactive investigative techniques (e.g., 
stings, undercover operations) are built, and it is also the primary reason they 
work so often. In a letter or during Internet correspondence an offender states
