insanity of any Limited Partner will dissolve the Partnership. 
Assignability of Limited Partnership Interests 
Neither the interest of any Limited Partner in the Partnership nor any beneficial interest therein is 
assignable, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the General Partner. 
Reports to Partners 
The Partners may receive periodic information conceming performance and other material 
portfolio developments of the Partnership at the discretion of the General Partner. The books and records 
of the Partnership will be audited at the end of each fiscal year by a firm of certified public accountants 
selected by the General Partner, and the Partners will be furnished with audited year-end financial 
statements including a statement of profit or loss for such fiscal year. It is noted that the Partnership's 
financial statements will be prepared using generally accepted accounting principles as a guideline, unless 
otherwise deemed appropriate at the sole discretion of the General Partner. The Partnership's independent 
public accountants are RSM US LLP. The General Partner reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to 
change independent public accountants without prior notice to the Limited Partners. 
Fiscal Year and Fiscal Periods 
The Partnership has adopted a fiscal year ending on December 31. Since Limited Partners may be 
admitted or required to retire and additional capital contributions or withdrawals may be made during the 
course of a fiscal year, the Partnership Agreement provides for fiscal periods, which are portions of a fiscal 
year, for the purpose of allocating net profits and net losses due to changes occurring in capital accounts at 
such times.

necessary to verify the identity of a prospective Limited Partner. In the event of delay or failure by the 
prospective Limited Partner to produce any information required for verification purposes, the General 
Partner may refuse to accept a capital contribution until proper information has been provided, and any 
funds received will be returned without interest to the account from which such funds were originally 
debited.
