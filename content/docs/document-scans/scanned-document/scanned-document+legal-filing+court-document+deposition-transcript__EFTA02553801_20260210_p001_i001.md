Power, Sex and Conspiracy 
by Joe Nocera 
"The 'C-word' in American journalism is Conspiracy," writes =dward Jay Epstein in his short, new e-book 
=http://mhpbooks.com/books/three-days-in-may/>,'Three Days in =ay," about l'affaire Dominique Strauss-Kahn By the 
time we reach this sentence, toward the end, Epstein has taken =s — practically moment by moment — through the 
series of events =hat culminated with D.S.K.'s arrest for allegedly forcing himself =exually on a hotel maid in Manhattan. 
The charges were later dropped =hen prosecutors concluded 
=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/19/dominique-strauss-kahn-pro=ecutor-reasons/print> that, even though 
the assault likely took place, =he maid's credibility was a problem. Still, Strauss-Kahn was forced =o resign as the 
managing director of the International Monetary Fund. =nd his political career — he was the favorite to challenge 
President =icolas Sarkozy of France in the election that will be decided on =unday 
=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/28/world/europe/hollande-and-sarkozy-tr=de-insults-as-runoff-nears.html> — was 
destroyed. 
The day before the alleged assault, Epstein writes, Strauss-Kahn had =articipated in a sex party in Washington. He then 
flew to New York and =ot a room at the Sofitel, whose parent company employed an executive =lose to Sarkozy's 
intelligence coordinator, according to Epstein. =fter dinner, D.S.K. returned to the hotel with a woman who was seen 
=xiting the ground-floor elevator at 3:56 a.m. Whenever he was visible =n one of the hotel's security cameras, a certain 
hotel executive =ould also be seen. Coincidence? Or was Strauss-Kahn being followed? 
The actions of the 32-year-old maid, Nafissatou Diallo =http://abcnews.go.com/US/dominique-strauss-kahns-accuser-
speaks/story?=d=14150192>, the next day added to the mystery. Several times she =ent in and out of a certain room on 
0.S.K.'s floor. She entered his =uite twice without her cleaning equipment. After the alleged assault, =.S.K. left the hotel 
to have lunch with his daughter — while Diallo =nexplicably re-entered his suite. 
It then took an hour for hotel security and Diallo to report the =ssault to the police. A few minutes after the call was 
made, two hotel =fficials were caught on camera doing a brief "victory dance." =Epstein has included the hotel videos 
chttp://mhpbooks.com/dsk/> as =art of his e-book.) When D.S.K. later realized that one of his =ellphones was missing —
a phone, Epstein notes ominously, that has =ever been found and whose GPS was turned off 23 minutes after he lost =t 
— he called the hotel to see if it had been retrieved. That call =ed to his arrest. 
What does one make of all this? In the immediate aftermath of =trauss-Kahn's arrest, French journalists flocked to the 
idea that he =ad somehow been set up by his enemies. But that thinking has largely =aded, especially after it was 
revealed that D.S.K. had been involved =n sex parties that included prostitutes and that were paid for by =ealthy 
businessmen friends of his. The Washington orgy he attended the =ight before his alleged assault was part of that ring; it 
has since =orphed into a bona fide scandal , and D.S.K. is once again in trouble =ith the law thanks to his sexual appetite. 
Of course, Epstein can't really prove there was a conspiracy, either. =ut he does believe that conspiracies are more 
common than most =ournalists credit; for much of his career, he has reveled in the kind =f tantalizing clues that could 
lead somewhere ... or nowhere. And so =t is here: the text message D.S.K. supposedly received telling him =hat his e-
mails were being monitored. The disappearance of his =lackBerry. The mysterious goings-on in the other room on 
D.S.K.'s =otel floor. And so on. 
It all seems very grassy knoll. Except that, as Epstein points out =hillingly, these days every one of us walks around with 
devices in our =ockets that allow even a mildly competent intelligence service to =rack our movements and overhear our 
conversations: our smartphones. =hether someone was spying on D.S.K. or not, they certainly could have =een. It is hard 
to dismiss the notion out of hand. (Epstein told me =hat he does not believe that Diallo was involved in any plot against 
=.S.K.) Eliot Spitzer had enemies, too, who badly wanted to bring him down. =hether they helped instigate the
