Daily Tax Report 
contract expires or is otherwise terminated. Each contract is for at least a year. The cash settlement 
amount is determined by a formula that generally [equals] reflects the increase (decrease) in the 
value of the securities, including expense and income payments made or received with respect to the 
securities held and traded within the Basket Transaction and the interest and fees payable to Bank 
for its services and capital. Taxpayer does not recognize gains, losses, income, or deductions as it 
trades the securities within the Basket Transaction. Instead, Taxpayer defers recognition of any tax 
consequences until the Basket Transaction expires or otherwise terminates, when Taxpayer 
recognizes gain equaling the difference between the cash settlement amount and the upfront 
payment made. 
Taxpayer's federal income tax returns for Years are currently under examination by the Internal 
Revenue Service. Based upon its review, Field Operations has determined that the Basket 
Transactions lack the requirements to be treated as options to purchase property for tax purposes. 
Further, Field Operations has determined that Taxpayer had the burdens and benefits of ownership 
of the securities underlying the Basket Transactions, and thus held the beneficial ownership of these 
securities for tax purposes. This Advice assumes that Field Operations is correct in its determinations. 
Accordingly, Field Operations has challenged Taxpayer's deferral of gains, losses, income, or 
deductions associated with the Basket Transactions. Field Operations intends to place Taxpayer on a 
correct accounting method consistent with its ownership of the securities. This accounting method will 
not permit Taxpayer to defer reporting the relevant gains, losses, income, or deductions until the 
Taxpayer identified Basket Transactions expire or terminate but will instead require Taxpayer to 
recognize these gains, losses, income, or deductions at a much earlier time, consistent with Field 
Operations' conclusion that Taxpayer, and not Bank, was the owner of each asset held within the 
basket. Pursuant to this accounting method change, Field Operations intends to impose an 
adjustment under IRC § 481(a) in the first tax year under examination. 
LAW AND ANALYSIS 
IRC § 446(b) provides that if no accounting method has been regularly used by the taxpayer, or if the 
method used does not clearly reflect income, the computation of taxable income shall be made under 
such method as, in the opinion of the Secretary, does clearly reflect income. See also Treas. Reg. 
§ 1.446-1(b)(1). 
The Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether a taxpayer's accounting method 
clearly reflects income, and the Commissioner's determination must be upheld unless it is clearly 
unlawful. See Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 522, 532-3 (1979), RCA Corp. v. United 
States, 664 F.2d 881, 886 (2nd Cir. 1981). 
IRC § 481(a) requires those adjustments necessary to prevent amounts from being duplicated or 
omitted to be taken into account when a taxpayer's taxable income is computed under an accounting 
method different from the method used to compute taxable income for the preceding tax year. 
General rules for accounting method changes 
imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. 
Using professional judgment in accordance with auditing standards, an examining agent will make 
findings of fact and apply the Internal Revenue Service's position on issues of law to determine 
whether an issue is an accounting method issue and if so, whether the taxpayer's accounting method 
is permissible. For this purpose, the term "accounting method issue" means an issue regarding 
whether the taxpayer's accounting treatment of an item is proper, but only if changing the taxpayer's 
treatment of such item could constitute a change in accounting method. See Rev. Proc. 2002-18, 
2002-1 C.B. 678, sections 3.01 and 5.01. An accounting method is permissible only when it clearly 
reflects income. 
An examining agent who determines that a taxpayer's accounting method is not permissible may 
propose an adjustment with respect to that method only by changing the taxpayer's accounting 
method. The agent has broad discretion in selecting a new accounting method and, except as 
provided in section 2.06 of Rev. Proc. 2002-18 (relating to previous accounting method changes made 
by a taxpayer without obtaining the requisite consent under IRC § 446(e)), the examining agent will 
select an accounting method that properly reflects the income of the taxpayer by applying the law to 
the facts as determined by the agent. The selected method must be a permissible accounting method 
and cannot be a method contrived to reflect the hazards of litigation. See Rev. Proc. 2002-18, 
sections 5.02 and 5.03. A taxpayer may challenge the selected method only upon showing an abuse 
of discretion. See Wilkinson-Beane, Inc. v. Commissioner, 420 F.2d 352, 353 (1st Cir. 1970), Stephens 
Marine, Inc. v. Commissioner, 430 F.2d 679, 686 (9th Cir. 1970), Standard Paving Co. v. 
Commissioner, 190 F.2d 330, 332 (10th Cir. 1951).
