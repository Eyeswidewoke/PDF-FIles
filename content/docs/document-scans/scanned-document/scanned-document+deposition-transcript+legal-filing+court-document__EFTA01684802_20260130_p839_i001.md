Applicable for Residents of the State of Massachusetts for Travel Accident Insurance: 
The following is hereby added to and made part of the Description of Coverage 
This Policy, alone, does not meet Minimum Creditable Coverage standards and will not satisfy the individual mandate that you have

and older, must have health coverage that meets the Minimum Creditable Coverage standards set by the Commonwealth Health 
Insurance Connector, unless waived from the hearth insurance requirement based on affordability or individual hardship. For more 
information call the Connector at 1-877-MA-ENROLL or visit the Connector website (www.mahealthconnector.orq).
This plan is not intended to provide comprehensive health care coverage and does not meet Minimum Creditable Coverage standards, 
even if it does include services that are not available in the insured's other health plans
