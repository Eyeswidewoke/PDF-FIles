Appendix 3 
U.S. BROKER-DEALER, U.S. FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT, 
or U.S. BANK: 
This Appendix describes the Re-use Risks and Consequences that may arise under Collateral 
Arrangements with a bank chartered under U.S. federal or state law, a U.S. branch or agency office of a 
non-U.S. bank (any such bank, branch, or agency office, a "U.S. banking organization"), a U.S. entity 
that is registered as a broker-dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("broker-
dealer), or a U.S. entity that is registered as a futures commission merchant with the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission ("FCM'). A single U.S. entity can operate, and be regulated, as both a broker-dealer 
and an FCM, but it remains subject to separate regulatory requirements with respect to its separate 
activities. 
U.S. law draws a distinction between financial instruments delivered to a broker-dealer or FCM and 
treated as customer assets ("Customer Assets"), financial instruments held by a U.S. banking 
organization in a trust or custodial capacity ("Custodial Assets"), and financial instruments delivered or 
pledged to a U.S. banking organization, broker-dealer, or FCM in a principal (non-customer) capacity 
("Non-Customer Assets"). Customer Assets held by a broker-dealer or FCM are subject to mandatory 
segregation requirements under the rules of the SEC and CFTC, respectively, and special-purpose 
insolvency regimes under which segregated assets, i.e., Customer Assets and cash required to be held 
in segregated accounts, are distributed to customers. Custodial Assets held by a U.S. banking 
organization are generally segregated on an account- or customer-specific basis, while in some 
circumstances broker-dealers and FCMs are permitted to segregate Customer Assets on an omnibus 
basis for all customers. 
Financial instruments held in a securities account at a broker-dealer or delivered to an FCM as margin (or 
"performance bond") for a cleared derivative generally constitute Customer Assets. On the other hand, 
securities delivered to us under a repurchase or securities lending agreement generally do not constitute 
Customer Assets. If, with respect to Customer Assets received by us as a broker-dealer, you separately 
agree to lend financial instruments to us under a securities lending agreement, or agree to sell financial 
instruments to us under a repurchase agreement, then the financial instruments are removed from your 
account and are no longer eligible for customer protection. Any financial instruments delivered to us 
under such transactions are Non-Customer Assets. If you are uncertain whether a financial 
instrument pledged or delivered to us is a Customer Asset, please obtain legal advice. 
With respect to Customer Assets received by us as an FCM in connection with your CFTC-regulated 
transactions, we generally cannot use such Customer Assets other than to margin, guarantee or secure 
those transactions. That is, we may transfer such assets to segregated or secured accounts established 
by us with banks, clearing houses and clearing brokers, which acknowledge, via rules or written 
agreements, that such Customer Assets are the property of the FCM's customers and can be utilized 
solely to margin, guarantee or secure customer transactions. In addition, an FCM may, pursuant to 
repurchase agreements, substitute such segregated Customer Assets, subject to very strict CFTC 
regulations, including the requirement that such substitution is made on a "delivery versus delivery" basis, 
and the market value of the substituted securities is at least equal to that of the Customer Assets being 
substituted. To the extent segregated assets were found to be insufficient to satisfy customer claims in 
full, customers would continue to have a claim against the proprietary assets of the FCM. 
With respect to Customer Assets received by us as a broker-dealer in connection with your SEC-
regulated transactions, we generally can use such Customer Assets only with your consent and subject 
to regulatory usage limits that are imposed both at the account level (by reference to the amount of your 
obligations to us) and across all customers (by reference to the amount of all customer obligations to us). 
The SEC requires that broker-dealers perform a daily valuation of Customer Assets (including related 
customer obligations) and maintain in segregation either Customer Assets or cash or other high-grade 
assets such that the value of segregated assets will at all times exceed the value of all Customer Assets 
net of customer obligations to the broker-dealer. Further, to the extent segregated assets were to be
