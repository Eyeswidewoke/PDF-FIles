the diverse preferential offender will be more varied, usually with a focus on his 
particular sexual preferences or paraphilias and sometimes involve children, 
whereas a pedophile% collection will focus predominately on children and some-
times involve other paraphilias. Searching a computer for this varied adult-theme 
pornography can sometimes be justified if it helps identify the person using the 
computer or is linked to and helps explain the victimization of children. If 
children are directly molested, the diverse offender is more likely to victimize 
pubescent children. More naive prepubescent children, however, are sometimes 
selected to minimize confronting possible challenges to or embarrassment over 
their deviant sexual interests. 
With an absence of prior criminal sexual activity, latent offenders present prob-
lems concerning what prosecution and sentence is appropriate. A thorough 
investigation and good forensic psychological evaluation, possibly aided by the 
use of the polygraph or other deception-assessment devices, are helpful in evalu-
ating such apparent "latent" offenders. 
Miscellaneous "Offenders" 
Miscellaneous "offenders" include 
■ media reporters - individuals who erroneously believe they can go online 
and traffic in child pornography and arrange meetings with suspected child 
molesters as part of an authorized and valid news exposé. 
■ pranksters - individuals who disseminate false or incriminating informa-
tion to embarrass the targets of their "dirty tricks." 
■ older "boyfriends" - individuals in their late teens or early twenties 
attempting to sexually interact with adolescent girls or boys. 
■ overzealous civilians - members of society who go overboard doing their 
own private investigations into this problem. As will be discussed, investi-
gators must be cautious of all overzealous civilians who offer their services 
in these cases. 
Although these miscellaneous "offenders" may be breaking the law, they are 
obviously less likely to be prosecuted. This category includes media reporters 
breaking the law as part of a bona-fide news story It does not include reporters, 
or any other professionals, who engage in such activity to hide or rationalize the 
fact that they have a personal interest in it. They would be situational or preferen-
tial offenders. Media reporters frequently do not notify law enforcement of their 
"undercover" activity until it reaches a crisis point, and then they want law 
enforcement to respond immediately. Overzealous civilians could also include 
sex-offender therapists and researchers engaging in this type of activity. Only 
law-enforcement officers as part of official, authorized investigations should be 
conducting proactive investigation or downloading child pornography on a com-
pute. No one should be uploading child pornography. It should be noted that 
federal law does allow an affirmative defense for the possession of child pornogra-
phy only if less than three matters are possessed and it is promptly, in good 
faith and without retaining or allowing access to any other person, destroyed or 
reported to a law-enforcement agency that is afforded access to each depiction 
(18 U.S.C. § 2252(c)). As previously stated the test for those claiming professional 
use of child pornography should be twofold. Do they have a professional use for
