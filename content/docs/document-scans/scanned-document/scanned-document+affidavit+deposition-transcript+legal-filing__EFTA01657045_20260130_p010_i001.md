conducted in England (George & Clifford, 1992), experienced police officers received training in 
the CI or did not receive such training. In both studies, the Cl-trained police investigators elicited 
considerably more information than did the untrained investigators. Thus, the field studies 
showed the same general pattern as the laboratory studies. 
Overall, the superior performance with the CI has been very robust: The effect generalizes across 
cultures (U.S., England, Germany, Australia), types of witness (young, elderly; college students 
and non-students; cognitively impaired or healthy), retention interval (few minutes, several 
weeks or years) and kind of event to be recalled (crime, accident, daily activities; for recent 
reviews, see Fisher & Schreiber, 2007; Holliday, Brainerd, Reyna, & Humphries, 2009). The 
only task in which the CI has not been superior is in person identification (e.g. lineups), where 
the CI was equivalent to a control interview. 
We do not know of any formal studies that have examined the CI's ability to enhance victims' 
psychological functioning. However, based on anecdotal evidence, we have some reason to 
believe that the CI does promote victims' psychological health. The first author (RF) regularly 
conducts training programs on the CI at FBI headquarters as part of a program for experienced 
sketch artists. Several of the sketch artists who had interviewed rape victims reported that, 
following a well conducted CI, victims often reported feeling more in control of their earlier 
ordeal and generally more self confident. The second author (RG) has conducted several 
investigative interviews for law enforcement, primarily on cold cases, and has observed 
witnesses to be generally upbeat and positive following the interviews. The witnesses tend to 
remark spontaneously about how well they think they did in the interview. Given that the CI 
leads to more information generated than most of the previous standard interviews that they have 
experienced, the witnesses' self evaluations typically are quite favorable. 
The CI was not developed for therapeutic purposes. Therapists are in the business of helping 
people to feel better. They care mainly about the "narrative truth" (what the patient believes to 
be true) that might give closure or catharsis to the patient (Cohler, 1994). In contrast, forensic 
investigative interviewers are concerned with the "historical truth" (reality) and any therapeutic 
value would be an added benefit if that could be achieved in the process. Indeed we, as well as 
others (Lindsay & Read, 1994), have consistently argued against applying the CI as a therapeutic 
tool in cases such as those involving "recovered memories." Similar arguments have been 
launched against non-therapeutic forensic hypnosis (People v. Shirley, 1982). Nevertheless, if 
the CI were used in a therapeutic context, any increase in fabrications remains to be documented 
empirically. We have no reason to believe that the CI would contribute to fabricating 
recollections. Empirically, we know that recall accuracy is as high as or slightly higher with the 
CI than with comparison interviews (see Koehnken et al's 1999 meta-analysis). CI interviewers 
tend to ask mainly open-ended questions and rarely ask leading or suggestive questions, thereby 
minimizing the opportunities for fabrication. Finally, CI interviewers explicitly instruct witnesses 
not to guess but to say "I don't know" and to report only those events that they remember, and 
not merely believe to be true. 
Sometimes the goals of a forensic investigation will clash with therapeutic concerns. The second 
author (RG) was asked to conduct a CI of a cold case victim a few years ago where the victim
