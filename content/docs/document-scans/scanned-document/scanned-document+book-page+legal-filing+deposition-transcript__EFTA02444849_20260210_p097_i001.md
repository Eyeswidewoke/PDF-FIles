and-effect explanations of behavior that 
give a sense of predictability and 
control. A meteorologist may know that 
a hurricane may strike here or there 
depending on environmental conditions. 
Lacking such knowledge, a hurricane 
that strikes here rather than there may 
lead people to invoke a mindful agent—
such as a God—to explain that action. 
Projecting. If introspection 
makes your own mind visible, then you 
might assume that those who look 
similar to you on the outside might look 
similar to you on the inside as well. 
Indeed, animals that move at a 
humanlike speed (such as a horse) seem 
more mindful to people than do animals 
that move either much slower (such as a 
sloth) or much faster (such as a 
hummingbird)." And an agent that look 
humanlike, such as a computerized 
avatar with human face, seems more 
mindful than avatars that do not look 
humanlike. Any parent knows how well 
toy makers love to capitalize on this 
tendency. But it is the converse of this 
effect that is even more interesting—
other minds become less visible as the 
agent becomes less similar to the self. 
Others that differ from you in their 
interests, nationality, or social status are 
likely to be seen as less mindful—less 
thoughtful, less likely to experience 
complicated emotions, less able to 
experience pain or suffering—than those 
that are similar to you. It is little 
wonder, then, that the history of human 
conflict is filled with instances of people 
dehumanizing radically different others, 
treating them like mindless animals or 
objects.12
Why Minds Matter 
It may not be obvious to you why 
it matters that your neighbor, every now 
and then, thinks that her computer has a 
mind of it's own, that a mayor believes 
that God punished his city by sending a 
hurricane, or that you truly believe that 
your pet poodle is thoughtful and 
considerate. Some of these attributions 
of mind seem purely metaphorical and 
therefore unimportant, as ways of 
speaking rather than ways of believing, 
whereas others seem to represent 
genuine beliefs about the real presence 
or absence of another social mind. But 
metaphors have a way of influencing 
behavior in ways that are consistent with 
believing the metaphor to be literally 
true. People metaphorically refer to 
feeling dirty after behaving unethically, 
and yet washing one's hands actually 
reduces the guilt that people report 
feeling from engaging in unethical 
actions." People are surely just 
speaking metaphorically when they refer 
to rejection as being given the cold 
shoulder, and yet research demonstrates 
that people do indeed report feeling that 
a room is colder after someone has just 
rejected them than after someone has 
just accepted them.14 And surely people 
are only speaking metaphorically when 
they refer to the stock market as anxious 
or jittery, and yet describing the market 
as mindful leads stock traders to believe 
that trends are likely to continue whereas 
describing the market as mindless leads 
traders to predict more random 
variability." Whether metaphorical or 
literal, seeing other agents as mindful 
matters because people tend to treat the 
agent as if it has a mind. That matters 
for at least three major reasons. 
First, mindful agents have both 
intentions and the capacity for self-
control. Mindful agents can therefore be 
held responsible for their actions. 
Possessing a guilty mind Omens real is
