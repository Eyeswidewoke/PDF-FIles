He showered her with gifts: E300 bottles of champagne, grand holidays and offered her the use of 
his mansions and seven cars. Together, they lived life to excess. 
But most important, Epstein helped Ghislaine forget her past. Through him, she began to build a 
respectability in New York that would have been impossible in London, where Maxwell7s crimes 
were less easily forgotten. 
Epstein was not, however, altogether straightforward. He may have been a firm fixture on the 
social scene but he had, to say the least, an opaque professional history ? a little like Robert 
Maxwell. 
He is rumoured to have worked either for the Israeli intelligence service, Mossad, the CIA or even 
both. 
On one occasion, he arrived in London at the home of a British arms dealer bringing a "gift" ? a 
New York police-issue pumpaction shotgun. "God knows how he got it into the country," said a 
friend. 
He has been described as a one-time maths teacher at a private school for girls and as a concert 
pianist. More recently, he has been given the vague title of "property developer". 
And while his assets include a £3mlllion Palm Beach mansion, a 26,000-acre Mexico City estate and 
a priceless Picasso, the exact origins of his fortune are not clear ? although through his company, 3. 
Epstein and Co, he manages the fortunes of around 15 clients with at least £500million in assets. 
But while he indulged Ghlslaine financially, Epstein ? like Maxwell ? could be cruel. 
"He Is a strange man," one friend is reported to have said early on in their relationship. 
"Not dislikable but difficult to understand. He can treat her very well or very badly. He can be 
impatient, demanding and extremely critical of her. At the same time he Is kind and protective." 
Ghlslaine was madly in love with Epstein ? and said to be desperate to marry him ? but Epstein 
would not commit himself and openly dated other women. 
Inevitably, their romance fizzled out but Ghislaine remained firmly in Epstein?s life. 
Ghislaine is said to have repaid him for his kindness to her when she first arrived In New York by 
introducing him to high society and potential business clients through contacts she made during 
her school days at Marlborough, and through her father?s illustrious friends. 
Thanks to Ghislaine, Epstein partied at Sandringham and Windsor with Prince Andrew, and 
attended a birthday party for the Queen. 
Thanks to Epstein, Ghislaine scaled the heights of New York society. It has been a very successful 
partnership. 
But he is not the sole reason for her success. Just as her father in his heyday was feted by high 
society and dubbed "the Bouncing Czech" because of his resilience, so she is every bit as steely. 
The similarities between Robert Maxwell and Ghisiaine are striking. Like her father, Ghislaine has 
verve and energy but above all she shares his lethal brand of charm.
