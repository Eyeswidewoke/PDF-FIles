Purpose or intention. Only past conse-
quences figure in selection. (i) A particu-
lar species does not have eyes in order 
that its members may see better; it has 
them because certain members, under-
going variation, were able to see better 
and hence were more likely to transmit 
the variation. (ii) The consequences of 
operant behavior are not what the behav-
ior is now for; they are merely similar to 
the consequences which have shaped 
and maintained it. (iii) People do not 
observe particular practices in order that 
the group will be more likely to survive; 
they observe them because groups which 
induced their Members to do so survived 
and transmitted them. 
Certain essences. (i) A molecule 
which could reproduce itself and evolve 
into cell, organ, and organism was alive 
as soon as it came into existence without 
the help of a vital principle called life. (ii) 
Operant behavior is shaped and brought 
under the control of the environment 
without the intervention of a principle of 
mind. (To suppose that thought appeared 
as a variation, like a morphological trait 
in genetic theory, is to invoke an unnec-
essarily large saltum.) (iii) Social envi-
ronments 
generate 
self-knowledge 
("consciousness") and self-management 
("reason") without help from a group 
mind or Zeitgeist. 
To say this is not to reduce life, mind, 
and Zeitgeist to physics; it is simply to 
recognize the expendability of essences. 
The facts are as they have always been. 
To say that selection by consequences is 
a causal mode found only in living things 
is only to say that selection (or the 
"replication with error" which made it 
possible) defines "living." (A computer 
can be programmed to model natural 
selection, operant conditioning, or the 
evolution of a culture but only when 
constructed and programmed by a living 
thing.) The physical basis of natural se-
lection is now fairly clear; the corre-
sponding basis of operant conditioning, 
and hence of the evolution of cultures. 
has yet to be discovered. 
Certain definitions of good and value. 
(i) What is good for the species is what-
ever promotes the survival of its mem-
bers until offspring have been born and, 
possibly, cared for. Good features are 
said to have survival value. Among them 
are susceptibilities to reinforcement by 
many of the things we say taste good, 
feel good, and so on. (ii) The behavior of 
a person is good if it is effective under 
prevailing contingencies of reinforce-
ment. We value such behavior and, in-
deed. reinforce it by saying "Good!" 
Behavior toward others is good if it is 
good for the others in these senses. (iii)

What is good for a culture is whatever 
promotes its ultimate survival, such as 
holding a group together or transmitting 
its practices. These are not, of course, 
traditional definitions; they do not recog-
nize a world of value distinct from a 
world of fact and, for other reasons to be 
noted shortly, they are challenged. 
Alternatives to Selection 
An example of the attempt to assimi-
late selection by consequences to the 
causality of classical mechanics is the 
term "selection pressure," which ap-
pears to convert selection into something 
that forces a change. A more serious 
example is the metaphor of storage. Con-
tingencies of selection necessarily lie in 
the past; they are not acting when their 
effect is observed. To provide a current 
cause it has therefore been assumed that 
they are stored (usually as "informa-
tion") and later retrieved. Thus, (i) genes 
and chromosomes are said to "contain 
the information" needed by the fertilized 
egg in order to grow into a mature orga-
nism. But a cell does not consult a store 
of information in order to learn how to 
change; it changes because of features 
which are the product of a history of 
variation and selection, a product which 
is not well represented by the metaphor 
of storage. (ii) People are said to store 
information about contingencies of rein-
forcement and retrieve it for use on later 
occasions. But they do not consult 
copies of earlier contingencies to discov-
er how to behave; they behave in given 
ways because they have been changed 
by those contingencies. The contingen-
cies can perhaps be inferred from the 
changes they have worked, but they are 
no longer in existence. (iii) A possibly 
legitimate use of "storage" in the evolu-
tion of cultures may be responsible for 
these mistakes. Parts of the social envi-
ronment maintained and transmitted by a 
group are quite literally stored in docu-
ments. artifacts, and other products of 
that behavior. 
Other causal forces serving in lieu of 
selection have been sought in the struc-
ture of a species, person, or culture. 
Organization is an example. (i) Until 
recently, most biologists argued that or-
ganization distinguished living from non-
living things. (ii) According to Gestalt 
psychologists and others, both percep-
tions and acts occur in certain inevitable 
ways because of their organization. (iii) 
Many anthropologists and linguists ap-
peal to the organization of cultural and 
linguistic practices. It is true that all 
species, persons, and cultures are highly 
organized, but no principle of organiza-
tion explains their being so. Both the 
organization and the effects attributed to 
it can be traced to the respective contin-
gencies of selection. 
Another example is growth. Develop-
mentalism is structuralism with time or 
age added as an independent variable. (i) 
There was evidence before Darwin that 
species had "developed." (ii) Cognitive 
psychologists have argued that concepts 
develop in the child in certain fixed or-
ders, and Freud said the same for the 
psychosexual functions. (iii) Some an-
thropologists have contended that cul-
tures must evolve through a prescribed 
series of stages, and Marx said as much 
in his insistence upon historical deter-
minism. But at all three levels the 
changes can be explained by the "devel-
opment" of contingencies of selection. 
New contingencies of natural selection 
come within range as a species evolves: 
new contingencies of reinforcement be-
gin to operate as behavior becomes more 
complex; and new contingencies of sur-
vival are dealt with by increasingly effec-
tive cultures. 
Selection Neglected 
The causal force attributed to struc-
ture as a surrogate of selection causes 
trouble when a feature at one level is said 
to explain a similar feature at another, 
the historical priority of natural selection 
usually giving it a special place. Sociobi-
ology offers many examples. Behavior 
described as the defense of territory may 
be due to (i) contingencies of survival in 
the evolution of a species, possibly in-
volving food supplies or breeding prac-
tices; (ii) contingencies of reinforcement 
for the individual, possibly involving a 
share of the reinforcers available in the 
territory; or (iii) contingencies main-
tained by the cultural practices of a 
group, promoting behavior which con-
tributes to the survival of the group. 
Similarly, altruistic behavior (i) may 
evolve through, say, kin selection; (ii) 
may be shaped and maintained by con-
tingencies of reinforcement arranged by 
those for whom the behavior works an 
advantage; or (iii) may be generated by 
cultures which, for example, induce indi-
viduals to suffer or die as heroes or 
martyrs. The contingencies of selection 
at the three levels are quite different, and 
the structural similarity does not attest to 
a common generative principle. 
When a causal force is assigned to 
structure, selection tends to be neglect-
ed. Many issues which arise in morals 
and ethics can be resolved by specifying
