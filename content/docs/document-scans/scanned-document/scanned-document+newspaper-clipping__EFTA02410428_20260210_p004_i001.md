ORIGINS I 
Bering of Queens University Belfast argue 
that children are predisposed to think that the 
mind persists even after the death of the 
body—something that approaches the idea 
of an afterlife. Bering showed children ages 4 
through 12 years old a puppet show in which 
a crocodile ate a mouse. Then he asked the 
children questions about the mouse. Did it 
feel hunger? Was it still mad at its brother? 
• The children agreed that the mouse's body no 
longer functioned; it didn't need to cat, for 
{ example. But they thought it would still feel 
Zi hunger; its psychological states persisted. 
Preschoolers showed this tendency more 
• than older children. 
We can acknowledge the death of the 
.1 body, says Bering. but we believe that the 
mind continues: "We have this unshakeable 
sense that our minds are immortal." Bloom 
notes that this kind of belief "is universal. 
g You won't find a community anywhere 
where most people don't believe that they are 
separate from their bodies."

Mind or soul? 
Such hypotheses seem to make intuitive 
sense. But critics such as Paul Harris of Har-
vard University say that children learn about 
the afterlife from others. Working in Spain 
and Madagascar, Harris and colleagues did 
studies somewhat similar to Bering's, asking 
children about the physical and psychological 
states of a person who had died. Older chil-
dren and adults were more likely than 
younger children to think that psychological 
states continued after death, suggesting that 
ideas of the afterlife are learned. What's 
more, people in many cultures distinguish 
between the mind, which learns and changes 
over time, and something like an unchange-
able soul, says Harris. "To say that there is a 
continuance of mind after death misrepre-
sents these people's beliefs," he says. "I 
think people arc disposed not to dualism but 
to 'triadism' " of mind, body, and soul. 
Even those who embrace the cognitive 
model concede that more studies arc needed 
to distinguish what is learned from what is 
o innate. As for hypersensitive agency detec-
tion, "it's a compelling idea, but I haven't 
seen lots of empirical evidence that you can 
get from there to religious beliefs." says 
social psychologist Am Norenzayan of the 
University of British Columbia. Vancouver, 
in Canada. 
Indeed, even if more data are forthcom-
ing, such models are a long way from 
explaining the complex systems of gods and 
rituals that make up religion. Cognitive 
researchers face what has come to be called 
the "Mickey Mouse" problem: The

fight-or kill-for him. Our social brains 
may help explain why children the world 
over are attracted to talking teacups, but reli-
gion is much more than that. "Deriving belief 
from the architecture of the mind is neces-
sary but not sufficient," says Norenzayan. 
He favors an additional class of explana-
tions for why religion is so prominent in 
every culture: It promotes cooperative 
behavior among strangers and so creates sta-
ble groups (Science, 3 October 2008, p. 58). 
Other researchers hypothesize that religion is 
actually adaptive: By encouraging helpful 
behavior, religious groups boost the biologi-
cal survival and reproduction of their mem-
bers. Adhering to strict behavioral rules may 
signal that a religion's members are strongly 
committed to the group and so will not seek a 
free ride, a perennial problem in cooperative 
groups (Science. 4 September, p. 11%). 
Norenzayan and others also note that 
helpful behavior is more common when peo-
ple think that they are being watched. so a 
supernatural god concerned with morality 
could encourage helpful behaviors, espe-
cially in large groups where anonymity is 
possible. Some researchers suggest that cog-
nitive tendencies led to religion, which 
then took hold and spread because it 
raised fitness. 
But others, such as Boyer. 
counter that this adaptationist 
explanation is itself light on 
data. "It is often said that reli-
gion encourages or prescribes 
solidarity within the group, but 
we need evidence that people 
actually follow [their religion's) rec-
ommendations?' says Boyer. "The case is 
still open." 
Meanwhile, disciplinary gaps persist 
among archaeology, psychology. and neuro-
science. Cognitive types insist that ancient 
objects can answer only a small subset of 
questions. while some archaeologists dis-
miss the cognitive model as speculation. Yet 
there have been some stirrings of interdisci-
plinary activity. Archaeologist Steven 
Mithen of the University of Reading in the 
United Kingdom has suggested that the half-
human. half-animal paintings and carvings 
of the Paleolithic demonstrate that early 
Homo sapiens were applying theory of mind 
to other animals 30,000 years ago. And 
anthropologists focusing on the develop-
ment of religion are finding signs of key 
changes in ritual at archaeological sites like 
Catalhoyilk. All agree that the field is expe-
riencing a surge of interest, with perhaps the 
best yet to come. "In the next 10 to 15 years 
there's likely to be quite a transformation, 
with a lot more evidence, to give us a com-
pelling story about how religion arose," 
says Norenzayan.
