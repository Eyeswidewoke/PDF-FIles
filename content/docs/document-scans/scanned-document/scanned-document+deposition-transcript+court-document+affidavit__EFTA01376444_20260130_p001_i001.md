(f) 
The Trustee shall supply, in a timely fashion, to the Co-Issuers and the 
Collateral Manager any information regularly maintained by the Trustee that the Co-Issuers or 
the Collateral Manager may from time to time request with respect to the Pledged Obligations, 
the Accounts, the other Collateral and provide any other requested information reasonably 
available to the Trustee by reason of its acting as Trustee hereunder and required to be provided 
by Section 10.6 or to permit the Collateral Manager to perform its obligations under the 
Collateral Management Agreement or the Collateral Administration Agreement. The Trustee 
shall promptly forward to the Collateral Manager copies of notices and other writings received 
by it from the issuer of any Collateral Obligation or from any Clearing Agency with respect to 
any Collateral Obligation which notices or writings advise the Holders of such security of any 
rights that the Holders might have with respect thereto (including, without limitation, requests to 
vote with respect to amendments or waivers and notices of prepayments and redemptions) as 
well as all periodic financial reports received from such issuer and Clearing Agencies with 
respect to such issuer. 
(g) 
The Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports shall be made 
available to the Persons entitled to such reports via the Trustee's website. The Trustee's website 
shall initially be located at "www.cdolink.com". Assistance in using the website can be obtained 
by calling the Trustee's customer service desk at telephone no. (301) 815-6600. Persons who are 
unable to use the above distribution option are entitled to have a paper copy mailed to them via 
first class mail by calling the Trustee's customer service desk. The Trustee shall have the right to 
change the method such reports are distributed in order to make such distribution more 
convenient and/or more accessible to the Persons entitled to such reports, and the Trustee shall 
provide timely notification (in any event, not less than 30 days) to all such Persons. 
Section 10.7 Release of Collateral.

Issuer Order executed by an Authorized Officer of the Collateral Manager, acting as agent on 
behalf of the Issuer, delivered to the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the settlement 
date for any sale of a Pledged Obligation certifying that the sale of such Pledged Obligation is 
being made in accordance with Section 12.1 hereof and such sale complies with all applicable 
requirements of Section 12.1, direct the Trustee to release or cause to be released such Pledged 
Obligation and, upon receipt of such Issuer Order, the Trustee shall deliver any such Pledged 
Obligation, if a security in physical form, duly endorsed to the broker or purchaser designated in 
such Issuer Order or, if such Pledged Obligation is a Clearing Corporation Security, cause an 
appropriate transfer thereof to be made, in each case against receipt of the sales price therefor as 
specified by the Collateral Manager in such Issuer Order; provided, however, that the Trustee 
may deliver any such Pledged Obligation in physical form for examination in accordance with 
street delivery custom. 
(b) 
If no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and subject to 
Article 12 hereof, the Trustee shall upon an Issuer Order (i) deliver any Pledged Obligation 
which is set for any mandatory call or redemption or payment in full to the appropriate paying 
agent on or before the date set for such call, redemption or payment, in each case against receipt 
of the call or redemption price or payment in full thereof and (ii) provide notice thereof to the
