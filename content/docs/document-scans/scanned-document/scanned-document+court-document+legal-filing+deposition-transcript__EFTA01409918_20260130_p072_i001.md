Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
therewith. In addition, in certain states, including states where we have 
existing restaurants or where we plan to open a restaurant, the number of 
liquor licenses available is limited, and licenses are traded on the open 
market. Liquor, beer and wine sales comprise a significant portion of our 
revenue. If we are unable to maintain our existing licenses, our guest 
patronage, revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected. Or, 
if we choose to open a restaurant in those states where the number of 
licenses available is limited, the cost of a new license could be 
significant. 
Any failure to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights could 
adversely affect the value of our brand. 
We have registered our principal trademarks including the FOGO, FOGO DE CHAO 
and BAR FOGO marks, the campfire design and other 
marks used by our restaurants as trade names, trademarks or service marks 
with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, in Brazil and in 
numerous foreign countries. The trademarks we currently use have not been 
registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which 
we do business or may do business in the future. We may never register such 
trademarks in all of these countries and, even if we do, the laws of 
some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the 
same extent as the laws of the United States. We believe that our 
intellectual 
property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The success 
of our business depends on our continued ability to use our intellectual 
property in order to increase our brand awareness, and the unauthorized use 
or other misappropriation of our intellectual property in the United 
States or any foreign countries could diminish the value of our brands and 
restaurant concept and may cause a decline in our revenue. We are also 
aware of names similar to those of our restaurants used by third parties in 
certain limited geographical areas in the United States, Brazil and 
elsewhere. Protective actions taken by us with respect to these rights may 
fail to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which could 
harm our reputation, brands or competitive position and, if we commence 
litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal 
expenses. 
In January 2015, the Brazilian Patent and Trademark Office published a 
request by Churrasciaria Vento Norte Ltda. (doing business as Vento 
Haragano) to partially nullify our trademark registration in Brazil for Fogo 
de Chao on the grounds that it violates the Brazilian Industrial Property 
Act for being descriptive. Vento Haragano has requested that the Brazilian 
Patent and Trademark Office declare that we not have exclusive rights 
to use the trademark Fogo de Chao at our locations in Brazil. If we lose the 
exclusive rights to use the trademark Fogo de Chao in Brazil, we could 
suffer damage or diminution of value to our brand. In addition, third 
parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any such claim, whether 
or 
not it has merit, could be time consuming, result in costly legal expenses, 
cause delays in the launch of new products, or require us to enter into 
royalty or licensing agreements, all of which could harm our business and
