restrict imports or exports, may adversely affect our business. Violations 
of or liability under any of these laws and regulations may result in 
administrative, civil or criminal penalties against us, revocation or 
modification of applicable permits, environmental investigations or remedial 
activities, voluntary or involuntary product recalls, warning or untitled 
letters or cease and desist orders against operations that are not in 
compliance, among other things. These laws and regulations may change in the 
future and we may incur (directly, or indirectly through our 
contract manufacturers) material costs to comply with current or future laws 
and regulations or in any required product recalls. In addition, we and 
our contract manufacturers are subject to additional regulatory 
requirements, including compliance with the environmental, health and safety 
laws 
and regulations administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or 
the EPA, state environmental regulatory agencies (including the 
Missouri Department of Natural Resources) and the National Labor Relations 
Board. Such laws and regulations generally have become more 
stringent over time and may become more so in the future. Costs of 
compliance, and the impacts on us of any non-compliance, with any such laws 
and regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 
There has been a recent trend in consumer class actions against food 
companies with respect to the use of the term "natural" in 
advertisements and on labels to describe human food products, and it is 
possible that there may be a similar trend in the future with respect to pet 
food products. There is no single U.S. government regulated definition of 
the term "natural" for use in the pet food industry. Currently, most states 
in the United States have adopted the AAFCO definitions and labeling 
guidelines relating to the term "natural" on pet food labels. Under the 
AAFCO's ingredient definitions and labeling guidelines, a pet food is 
designated as "natural" if it contains only ingredients that are derived 
solely 
from plant, animal or mined sources, has not been subject to a chemically 
synthetic process and does not contain any chemically synthetic additives 
(other than synthetically derived vitamin, minerals or trace nutrients that 
are added to enhance nutrition that are disclosed on the label). Although 
we believe that our labels and advertisements that identify our products as 
"natural" comply with the applicable laws and regulations, we may still 
be subject to related claims and lawsuits, which could have a material 
adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations. In 
addition, the AAFCO definition of "natural" or the definition of "natural" 
as adopted by states in the United States may change in the future. In 
such event, we may need to change our product specifications and 
formulations in order to continue to be classified as "natural" under the 
updated 
definition, which may result in increased costs and could adversely affect 
our results of operations. 
Certain groups and individuals have recently proposed laws and regulations 
at the state and federal levels, requiring disclosure of the
