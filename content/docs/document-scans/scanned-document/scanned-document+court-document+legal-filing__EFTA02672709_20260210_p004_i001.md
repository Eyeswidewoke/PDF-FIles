2.4.11 WCI shall review and approve or take other appropriate action upon Contractor's submittals 
such as Shop Drawings, Product Data and Samples, but only for the limited purpose of checking for 
conformance with information given and the design concept expressed in the Contract Documents. 
WCI's action shall be taken with such reasonable promptness as to cause no delay. WCI's approval of

Time which are not inconsistent with the intention of the Contract Documents.

completion and shall issue a final Certificate of Payment.

any time limits agreed upon. 
When making such interpretations and initial decision, WCI shall

either, and shall not be liable for results of interpretations or decisions so rendered in good faith.
