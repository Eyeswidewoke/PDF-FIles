solely through shared needles, is far 
more prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa 
than had previously been believed. 
Needles and blood transfusions couldn't 
possibly account for all the cases. More 
ominously, working with researchers 
from Cameroon and the Centers for 
Disease Control, in Atlanta, Wolfe 
discovered that the simian foamy virus, 
which is endemic in Old World pri-
mates, infects one per cent of those 
who come into regular contact with go-
rillas and other monkeys. That amounts 
to thousands of people walking around 
Cameroon with a retroviral infection 
that may or may not lead to illness. Be-
fore the study was published, the virus, 
which earned its evocative name be-
cause cells infected by it look foamy 
under a microscope, had never been 
known to pass between wild animals 
and hunters. None of the people in-
fected with S.F.V. have shown signs of 
sickness. Yet, as H.I.V. has demon-
strated, it can take years for a retrovirus 
to cause symptoms of a disease. 
Wolfe hopes to create a database 
containing genetic information from 
those viruses, a resource that biologi-
cal engineers could use to assemble 
effective vaccines from standard molec-
ular parts. Building such vaccines, 
while a long way off, is a fundamental 
goal of synthetic biology. American 
bioterrorism experts have shown par-
ticular enthusiasm, though: any pro-
cess that might protect humanity from 
natural viruses could also be deployed 
against viruses made by man. 
(This is just one reason that 
the Department of Defense 
and other federal agencies 
have been highly supportive 
of Wolfe's research.) "The 
more we learn about how 
these viruses are transmitted 
to humans, the more likely 
we will be able to stop them," 
Anthony S. Fauci, the direc-
tor of the National Institute of Allerg 
and Infectious Diseases, said. "It is al-
ways better to prevent a disease than to 
treat it." 
Detecting viral pandemics before 
they spread will be hard; responding 
to them before they spread will be 
harder still. "When it comes to under-
standing the origins of human dis-
eases, you would be surprised how lit-
tle we know," Wolfe said. "Where do 
the major diseases come from? How 
does a particular virus make the transi-
tion into a human host? Is it influ-
enced by certain types of behavior or 
certain parts of the world? Why are 
some viruses so much more deadly 
than others? We have no answers for 
many of those questions." Even if sci-
entists succeed in identifying new vi-
ruses before they escape into the wider 
population, pandemics won't disap-
pear. "We know a lot about heart dis-
ease," Wolfe said. "But it still kills 
thousands of people every day." 
Like snakes, viruses have a reputa-
tion as malevolent, poisonous, and 
deadly. In fact, most snakes are harm-
less, and dangerous viruses are rare. In 
order to inflict serious harm, a virus 
has to dear several biological hurdles. 
First, it has to remain unrecognized by 
the human immune system—to evade 
any protective antibodies. The virus 
would also need to make humans sick 
(Most do not.) Finally, it would have 
to spread efficiently—for example, 
through coughing, sneezing, or shak-
ing hands. Many viruses fulfill one of 
these criteria; some fulfill two; far 
fewer meet all three. "Look at H.I.V.," 
Wolfe said. "We would have to call 
that the biggest near-miss of our life-
time. Can you imagine how many peo-
ple would already have died if H.1.V. 
could be transmitted by a cough?" 
Viruses mutate rapidly, particularly 
in comparison with the glacial pace 
of human evolution. What 
seems benign one day can be-
come deadly the next. Cold 
viruses are usually considered 
little more than nuisances, but 
SARS, a virus from the same 
family as many colds, is lethal. 
So is avian influenza. "When 
it comes to predicting what a 
virus will do, we don't even 
know what it is we need to 
learn," Wolfe said. "We are really just 
at the beginning." 
He continued, "There was a mo-
ment in the nineteenth century before 
we had charted all the mammals in the 
world, and we found so many new spe-
cies that people would say, 'Oh, gosh, 
we will never document the diversity of 
animal life on this planet.' And with 
mammals that now seems silly, because 
you would have to search your entire 
life to find a new primate. That early 
moment of discovery is where we are 
now with viruses.. . . I don't want to 
oversell it. But in theory, at least, the 
recipe is simple. You plug the danger-
ous viruses into some sort of vaccine 
pipeline. Get all the vaccine parts lined 
up, put them together, and get them to 
the people." 
Wolfe's optimism is easy to em-
brace. Nonetheless, the barriers to 
achieving control over our biological 
surroundings are daunting. "I won't 
say viruses can be conquered," David 
Baltimore told me. Baltimore, the for-
mer president of Caltech, received a 
Nobel Prize for his work in elucidat-
ing the mechanics of retroviruses. "Not 
completely. But they don't have to 
conquer us, either." 
Pr he morning after we arrived in 
Ngoila, Matthew LeBreton, the 
ecology director of Global Virus Fore-
casting, stood in a laboratory in the 
back of the group's spare but well-
equipped outpost. He slipped on a 
surgical smock, a pair of latex gloves, a 
face mask, and safety glasses. Then he 
picked up a live fruit bat and dangled it 
at arm's length. There are three dozen 
species of bats in southeastern Camer-
oon. LeBreton can identify all of diem. 
Bats are well known for transmitting 
rabies, but they carry other debilitating 
microbes as well; fruit bats, for exam-
ple, are believed to be the principal 
source of the Ebola virus. 'The more 
you know about bats the more you are 
going to know about viruses," Le-
Breton told me as he laid the choco-
late-brown specimen on a digital scale. 
"We try to process them carefully and 
often." 
LeBreton took urine and fecal sam-
ples from the bat. He worked delib-
erately, but with speed, spreading the 
bat's wings and pricking them to ob-
tain a blood sample, which he depos-
ited in a vat of liquid nitrogen. He then 
turned to me and said, "Now we set the 
bat free." 
Later that morning, we drove to 
Mbalam to watch Joseph Diffo, who 
was born in a similar Cameroonian vil-
lage, discuss the dangers of bushmeat 
with local hunters and their families.
