thinking and bizarre behaviour (defined as 'positive' 
symptoms), and deficits in emotional expression and 
volition (defined as 'negative' symptoms). 
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a particularly 
good example of a neurodegenerative disorder char-
acterized by shared properties and perhaps even 
shared underlying causal factors with schizophrenias. 
FTD is a midlife onset clinical condition first 
described by Arnold Pick (1892) and previously 
known as Pick's disease (Kertesz, 2008). It is char-
acterized by progressive behavioural and personality 
abnormalities and/or language impairment that have 
been associated with the degeneration of frontal and/ 
or temporal regions of the brain (Harciarek & Jodzio, 
2005). The clinical presentation of FTD is heteroge-
neous, and FTD is commonly divided into two sub-
types. The first subtype of FTD is its behavioural 
variant, with impaired social conduct, disinhibition, 
stereotypic behaviours, loss of empathy, as well as 
apathy among its most prominent features (Rask-
ovsky et al., 2011). The second subtype of FTD is 
its language variant, also often described as primary 
progressive aphasia (PPA) (Hodges, 2007; Mesulam, 
2003). According to the most recent classification, 
PPA can be further divided into three variants: 
semantic, non-fluent/agrammatic, and logopenic 
(Gomo-Tempini et al., 2011; Harciarek & Kertesz, 
2011; Mesulam et al., 2008). Of note, in comparison 
to the semantic and the non-fluent/agrammatic PPA 
predominantly associated with ftontotemporal lobar 
degeneration (FTLD), the logopenic variant has 
been more often linked to the pathology of Alzheim-
er's disease (Grossman, 2010; Mesulam et al., 2008; 
Rabinovici et al., 2008). 
Although schizophrenia and FTD have been typi-
cally described in terms of specific feature constella-
tions characteristic for each disorder (e.g. younger 
onset and more pronounced delusions as well as hal-
lucinations in schizophrenia), it has been also shown 
that there is a great deal of clinical, neuroimaging, 
genetic, and pathological overlap, making it some-
times difficult to distinguish between these two con-
ditions (Momeni et al., 2010a). The association 
between schizophrenia and FTD has been rarely and 
only recently studied, however, despite Kraepelin's 
early observations. This may, at least in part, reflect 
the diagnostic criteria applied for schizophrenia and 
FTD, as well as the traditional dominance of rigid 
diagnostic taxonomies. For example, subjects with a 
history of neurological conditions are typically not 
included in studies of schizophrenia. Also, widely 
used diagnostic criteria for FTD (McKhann et al., 
2001; Neary et al., 1998) do not encompass assess-
ment of psychotic symptoms, although these have 
been known to appear in FTD (Chow et al., 1999; 
Le Ber et al., 2006, 2008; Mendez et al., 2008; 
Schoder et al., 2010). 
Schizophrenia and FTD 
169 
Difficulties with differentiating between schizo-
phrenia-related psychosis and neurodegenerative dis-
orders suggestive of certain common underlying 
factors are not new, and they predate the original 
work by Kraepelin (1919) and Pick (1892). One such 
ambiguous case was the case of Ludwig II, King of 
Bavaria (1845-1886), whose medical history has 
been recently reviewed by Forstl et al. (2008). 
According to the royal medical report, significant 
and rather progressive changes in the personality and 
behaviour of Ludwig II were noted when he reached 
the age of about 25. He became withdrawn and, as 
with many patients with FTD became obsessed with 
irrelevant details. His speech became odd (although 
its specific characteristics were not recorded) and he 
became aggressive. He also became delusional with 
frequent hallucinations, this bringing his clinical pic-
ture towards schizophrenia-like psychosis. Interest-
ingly, however, he seemed to be well aware of his 
abnormal behaviour but did not attempt to alter it, 
despite the apparent insight. With age, certain motor 
symptoms developed, which are common in both 
schizophrenia and FTD. According to Forstl et al. 
(2008), the description of Ludwig's symptoms is 
congruent with the diagnosis of schizophrenia disor-
der according to DMS-IV. This diagnosis is further 
supported by a positive family history for schizophre-
nia-like psychosis; both Ludwig's younger brother 
Otto as well as the youngest daughter of Ludwig's 
grandfather developed severe mental disorder with 
inappropriate affect, catatonic behaviour and apathy 
from an early age until death. At the same time, a 
post-mortem examination of Ludwig II, who died in 
unclear circumstances (possibly drowning), revealed 
extensive frontal atrophy in both hemispheres sug-
gestive of a neurodegenerative disease. 
In this paper we review the evidence for a relation-
ship between schizophrenia and FTD and introduce 
the hypothesis that their respective causations could 
be manifestations of the abnormalities involving the 
same genes at different life stages: early in schizophre-
nia and late m FTD. Of course, both schizophrenia 
and FTD are syndromes consisting of heterogeneous 
components, so any hypothesis pertaining to the sim-
ilarity of underlying mechanisms is likely to be appli-
cable only to certain subtypes of schizophrenia and 
subtypes of FTD. We will examine several sources of 
evidence pertaining to the relationship between 
schizophrenia and FTD: (1) symptom similarity, 
(2) familial co-morbidity, (3) neuroanatomy, (4) 
genetics, and (5) epigenetics.
