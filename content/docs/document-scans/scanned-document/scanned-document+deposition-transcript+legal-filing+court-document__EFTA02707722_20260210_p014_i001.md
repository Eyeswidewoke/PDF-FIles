Remedies upon Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Bank may, by 
notice to Borrower, declare this Note, all interest hereon and all other amounts payable under 
each Note or any Loan Document to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon each Note, all 
such interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without 
presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly 
waived by Borrower; and any obligation of Bank to permit further borrowing under each 
Note shall immediately cease and terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, upon 
the occurrence of an Event of Default arising under Section 4(g) above as a result of the 
commencement of a proceeding under the United States Federal Bankruptcy Code with 
respect to any Obligor, each Note and all interest and all other amounts owing to Bank under 
the Loan Documents shall automatically become and be due and payable, without 
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived 
by Borrower. The provisions hereunder for a Default Rate shall not be deemed to extend the 
time for any payment hereunder or to constitute a "grace period" giving the Obligors a right 
to cure any default. At Bank's option, if permitted by applicable law, any accrued and 
unpaid interest, fees or charges may, for purposes of computing and accruing interest on a 
daily basis after the due date of each Note or any installment thereof, be deemed to be a part 
of the principal balance, and interest shall accrue on a daily compounded basis after such 
date at the rate provided in each Note until the entire outstanding balance of principal and 
interest is paid in full. Bank is hereby authorized at any time to set off and charge against 
any deposit accounts of any Obligor, as well as any money, instruments, securities, 
documents, chattel paper, credits, claims, demands, income and any other property, rights 
and interests of any Obligor which at any time shall come into the possession or custody or
