is a member, at Client's election. Client agrees that Client shall 
make Client's election by registered mail to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., 
Compliance Department - Attention: Director of Compliance, 60 
Wall Street, 23rd Floor, Mail Stop NYC60-2330, New York, NY 10006-2836. If 
Client's election is not received by DBSI within ten (10) 
calendar days of receipt of a written request from DBSI that Client make an 
election, then DBSI may elect the forum before which the 
arbitration shall be held. 
- Neither DBSI nor Client waive any right to seek equitable relief pending 
arbitration. No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to 
arbitration, nor seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement 
against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or 
who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with 
respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action 
until (I) the class certification is denied; or (ii) the class is 
decertified; or (iii) the customer is excluded from the class by the court. 
Such 
forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a 
waiver of any rights under this agreement except to the extent stated 
herein. 
Important Disclosures for Your Records 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. "DBSI" is furnishing this document to you to 
alert you to important matters regarding your account. 
Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SI PC") 
Securities held by our clearing broker, Pershing LLC, for your account are 
protected up to the total net equity held in the account. Of this total, SIPC 
provides $500,000 of coverage, including $100,000 for claims for cash 
awaiting reinvestment. The remaining coverage is provided by Pershing 
through a commercial insurer. SIPC protection applies when the SIPC member 
firm through which you hold your investments fails financially and is 
unable to meet its obligations to securities clients, but SIPC protection 
does not protect against losses attributable to the rise and fall in the 
market 
vaiue of investments. A smaii number of client accounts are not carried on 
Pershing's books due to specific account factors. These accounts are 
covered under DBSi's SIPC membership. DBSI does not provide coverage in 
excess of SIPC coverage. Certain investments, such as commodity 
futures contracts and currency, are ineligible for SIPC protection. For 
additional information on SIPC, see www.SIPC.org or call the SIPC public 
information number, (202) 371-8300. 
Payment for Order Flow 
DBAB receives payment when its routes for execution certain orders in 
certain securities. The determination as to where to route orders is based on 
several factors, consistent with DBSi's obligation to provide best execution 
for all client orders. Because several factors are considered with respect 
to such determinations, DBSI could potentially secure price improvements on 
such orders by routing them in a different manner and all such orders 
potentially could be executed at prices superior to the best bid or best 
offer. Payment is received by DBSI in the form of rebates, or credits against 
exchange fees, and specialist fees. Details will be furnished upon written 
request.
