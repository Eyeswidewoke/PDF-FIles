Notice that in the passage from the second to the third line we multiply and divide by na. = 0. The conclusion is then 
incorrect. 
There are two kinds of responses we can make to this issue. 
We assumed all ni and n, were large in arguing for the form that led to quantum theory. If this viewpoint is correct that 
quantum dynamics fails for systems that are in states that are unique in the universe. As we indicated above, there could 
be other terms that come in. 
Nonetheless the problem is easy to address also within the current rules. All that is required is either I) require that the 
basis chosen for the beables is such that no no = 0 or 2) add to the universe a small number of spectator states in each 
possible a so that no n, = 0. 3) Insist on a tiny admixture to every state of a state with all no non-vanishing such as the 
ground state. 
• Might deviations from quantum mechanics be observable? To test this idea we would like to predict phenomena which 
do not occur in conventional quantum mechanics. The nodes issue is a sign that there must be such phenomena. When a 
quantum system is large and complex enough that it has accessible states which are likely to have small occupation num-
bers in the universe. deviations from quantum mechanics can be expected. We note that it is likely that these violate signal 
locality, as has been shown to be necessary with a large class of non-local hidden variables theories out of equilibriumI71. 
It would be interesting to determine if indeed the possibility of faster than light signalling exists in this formulation of 
quantum mechanics for cases where quantum dynamics breaks down. 
• Is the mixing given by the copy rule (37) fast enough to account for observations? Might there be an observable process 
of relaxation of a single systems outcomes to the ensemble relative frequency and hence to the quantum mechanical 
probability distributions? 
• What theory is quantum mechanics an approximation to? The first assumption of this approach is that quantum mechanics 
is an approximation to a different, cosmological theory, applicable only for small subsystems that come in many copies. 
We then can aspire to discover the principles that this novel theory is based on. A first goal will be search for principles 
which could characterize such a theory that might be testible in experiments where quantum mechanics is expected to fail 
because the requirement that occupation numbers be large breaks down. 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
Here we have proposed a new interpretation of quantum mechanics based on a new concept of the distinction between a 
microscopic and macroscopic systems. The distinction is that microscopic systems are those that come in vast numbers of 
copies in the universe, while macroscopic systems are big and complex enough that they are unique. Only microscopic systems 
can satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics, because those laws are consequences of the copy dynamics, and these don't act when 
there are no systems to copy. 
Hence, this proposal addresses the question as to why macroscopic systems do not have quantum properties. It is simply that 
if a system is sufficiently composite it has so many possible states that it has no copies within the universe. It is a member of 
an ensemble of one. It is simply a fact that there are a vast number of hydrogen atoms in each of the low lying states within the 
Hubble scale. But there is only one you, and only one system identical quantum mechanically to your cat Emily. This implies 
that quantum mechanics must be an approximation to a cosmological theory which is formulated in different terms. 
As a result of its limited domain of applicability, the proposal we have made here may have striking consequences for experi-
ment, for it proposes a new regime where quantum dynamics should fail or receive corrections. Quantum dynamics should fail 
both for systems that have no copies in the universe and for systems in states that are unique in the universe. This leads us to ask 
whether it is possible to use the technology of quantum computation to produce a device that can be put into unique, coherent 
quantum states, unlikely to exist anywhere else?
