Finally, Hillary Clinton, the

thinks. 
open bids for il. Soros. Wasserstein. Kravis. Weill. The Sturm and Drang of 
their successes and failures has been played out in public. Epstein breaks the 
mold. Most everyone on the Street has heard of him, but nobody seems to 
know what the hell he is up to. Which is just the way ho likes it.

'My belief is that Joff maintains some sort of money-management ram, though 
you won't get a straight answer from him,' says one well-known investor. 'He 
once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I've also heard that he 
manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the 
Wizard of Oz — there may be less there than meets the eye.' 
Says another prominent Wall Streeter: 'He Is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque 
figure. Ho likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of 
aloofness. The whole thing Is weird.' 
The wizard that meets the eye is spare and fit; with a long jaw and a carefully 
coiffed head of silver hair, he looks like a taller, younger Ralph Lauren. A 
raspy Brooklyn accent betrays his Coney Island origins. He spends an hour 
and fifteen minutes every day doing advanced yoga with his personal 
instructor, who travels with him wherever he goes. Fie is an enthusiastic 
member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations. 
He dreaans casualty 
jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers -- and is 
rarely seen in a tie. Indeed, those close to him say the reason he quit his 
board seat at the Rockefeller Institute was that he hated wearing a suit. 'It 
feels like a dress,' he told ono friend. 
Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched 
alcohol or chugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you 
talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. 'I've known Jeff for fifteen 
years. Terrific guy- Trump booms from a speakerphone. 'He's a lot of fun to 
be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and 
many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his 
social fie.' 
But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about 
Epstein: As some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. 'I Invest In
