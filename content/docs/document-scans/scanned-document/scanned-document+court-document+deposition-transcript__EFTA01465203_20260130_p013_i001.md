If a sum or obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that 
obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant 
party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained. 
Nothing in this Section 6(f) shall be effective to create a charge or other 
security interest. This Section 6(f) shall be without prejudice and in 
addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien or other 
rights to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by 
operation of law, contract or otherwise)." 
(f) 
Escrow. On any date on which both parties are required to make 
payments hereunder, either party may at its option and in its sole 
discretion notify the other party that payments on that date are to be made 
in escrow. In this case deposit of the payment due earlier on that date 
shall be made by 2:00 p.m. (local time at the place for the earlier payment 
if there is a time difference between the cities in which payments are to be 
made) on that date with an escrow agent selected by the party giving the 
notice and reasonably acceptable to the other party, accompanied by 
irrevocable payment instructions (i) to release the deposited payment to the 
intended recipient upon receipt by the escrow agent of the required deposit 
of the corresponding payment from the other party on the same date 
accompanied by irrevocable payment instructions to the same effect or (ii) 
if the required deposit of the corresponding payment is not made on that 
same date, to return the payment deposited to the party that paid it into 
escrow at such party's request. The party that elects to have payments made 
in escrow shall pay the costs of the escrow arrangements and shall cause 
those arrangements to provide that the intended recipient of the payment due 
to be deposited first shall be entitled to interest on that deposited 
payment for each day in the period of its deposit at the rate offered by the 
escrow agent for that day for overnight deposits in the relevant currency in 
the office where it holds that deposited payment (at 11:00 a.m. local time 
on that day) if that payment is not released by 5:00 p.m. local time on the 
date it is deposited for any reason other than the intended recipient's 
failure to make the escrow deposit it is required to make hereunder in a 
timely fashion.

(ii) 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. Each party acknowledges and agrees 
that (A) Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. or another designated Affiliate of 
Party A (the "Designated Agent") will act as agent for Party A in connection 
with certain Transactions when so specified in the Transaction Confirmation; 
and (B) the Designated Agent is acting solely as agent and shall have no 
liability for the performance of either party's obligations under this 
Agreement or any Transaction, or for costs, expenses, damages or claims
