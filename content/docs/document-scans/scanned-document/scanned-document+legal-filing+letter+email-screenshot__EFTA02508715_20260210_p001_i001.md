Leon, 
in order to keep things in perspective, =AO and I recognize this may be difficult, an analogy i used before might be 
helpful. =AO You and your famil= are a 6 billion dollar corp. with income between 250 -500 mi=lion dollars per year. It 
contains operating biz, a large array of exisitn= investments desire for others. .a panoply of loans notes. =AO, planes. 
boats homes.. trusts grats. over 100 bank accts.. law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns, foreign firms. art 
consultants. con=truction consultants bill payers, home !lc's with all that y=u only have a combined overhead of less 
that 3 million dollars. It is way out of whack. 
I have previously sent y=u the note that i have enclosed with highlights (see the paragrap= below.) that I wrote to you 
over a year ago. As my =AO acute disability ( selective memory) seems to be raised often as one =f your a concerns , I 
as a rule try to memorialize things in writing in =n attempt to lay out issues that I fear may later turn out to be a 
problem. ie wh=t i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. and those things that=C2 are not. Things that I 
thought should be done so that you=20 wouldn't find yourself in the place where you currently find yourself. howver 
,you =hose to defer many of the requests- see below -,until only weeks ago. y=u chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into t= is year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warnin= that you 
needed to do something re personnel if it were to stablize=C2 you chose to wait. .

With regard the more pres=ing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong inclination is 
not to be=20 involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught w=th many pitfall many that will make 
you very upset and a major pain in the ass. =AO I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people involved need to 
=e upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the begi=ning of my involvement ) I am also aware 
however of my overar=hing friendship obligations of ok, -given all the complexities w=o else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. child=en with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking with little 
direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone=would report to him. 
Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long=shot my first choice as I prefer only being 
responsible and standing behind =y own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be transmit=ed to reflect 
status stated by others ) 
With =o commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to think 
through the problem creatively=. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you might find very 
costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk s=aring, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my terms 
doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat<=span> administrator. not sure what role you prefer for 
=ileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Ric= your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having 
Tom report to a =ew person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy Gregory, I wou=d suggest limiting to one person. 
The increasing public profile needs to be tak=n into consideration. 
talk later..c 
With your consen= ., Eileen did not report to Delson ( the conduit directly to me) , she continued to provide bad=info to 
both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each time with my early call to you that she was 
g 
y !! =AO No one was hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was e=en interviewed and even now , 
Brad is not full time,(crazy ) Eileen followed your instructions. not mine. in fact she continued to ignore=20 mine 
saying " but Leon " its on" Leons desk" , =C2 You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance. of her
