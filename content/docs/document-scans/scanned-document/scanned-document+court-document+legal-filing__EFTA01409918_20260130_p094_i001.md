Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a 
fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to 
us 
or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to 
any provision of the DGCL, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed 
by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said Delaware 
court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as 
defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring 
or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have 
notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum 
provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial 
forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, 
officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us 
and 
our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to 
find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in 
respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we 
may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in 
other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial 
condition or results of operations. 
We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. 
We intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to fund 
the operation and growth of our business and to repay indebtedness, 
and therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of 
our capital stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination 
regarding the payment of any dividends will be made at the discretion of our 
board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results 
of operations, capital requirements, liquidity, contractual restrictions, 
general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may 
deem relevant. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common 
stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way 
to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash 
dividends should not invest in our common stock. 
Our future capital requirements are uncertain, and we may have difficulty 
raising money in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. 
Our capital requirements depend on many factors, including the amounts 
required to open new restaurants and to service our indebtedness. To 
the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet these 
requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or 
curtail 
our growth, reduce our costs and expenses, or sell certain of our assets. 
Any additional equity offerings or debt financings may be on terms that are 
not favorable to us. Equity offerings could result in dilution to our 
stockholders, and equity or debt securities issued in the future may have 
rights, 
preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock. If 
our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence 
of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary 
capital.
