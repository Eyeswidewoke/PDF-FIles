HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Limited Partners may be privy to certain information regarding the Partnership that may not be 
available to other Limited Partners and such Limited Partners may make investment decisions with 
respect to their investment in the Partnership based on such information, including requesting 
withdrawals. Although certain Limited Partners may invest in the Partnership with different 
material terms, the Partnership and the Management Company generally will only offer such terms 
if they believe other Limited Partners of the Partnership will not be materially disadvantaged. The 
Partnership, or in certain cases the Management Company, may enter into side letters with Limited 
Partners, without notice to, or consent of, other Limited Partners. Favorable Terms granted to 
certain investors in the Funds (other than current and former Principals and employees of the 
Management Company, their family members and/or related entities) will be offered to all existing 
investors with an equal or greater investment in the Funds; provided that (i) such terms or 
conditions were not offered based on an investor's special regulatory, tax or other particular status 
and (ii) an investor electing to accept such favorable terms or conditions also agrees to be bound 
by any conditions, restrictions, limitations, or obligations imposed on an investor in connection 
with its investment in the Fund(s). Other rights and investment terms that do not constitute 
Favorable Terms may not be so offered to such other existing investors. 
Individual Investor Investment Restrictions 
Certain investors ("SRI Investors") that are subject to a "socially responsible" or similar 
investment mandate which precludes them from participating in profits or losses attributable to 
certain securities and other instruments ("Restricted Investments") of companies ("Restricted 
Companies") have entered into side letter agreements with the Offshore Fund and the Management 
Company (and may enter into similar relationships in the future with the other Feeder Funds, 
including the Partnership) whereby the Management Company uses what it believes to be 
reasonable efforts to allocate profits and losses attributable to such Restricted Companies away 
from the SRI Investors' shares (the "SRI Shares") and to the other investors ("non-SRI Investors") 
who are not SRI Investors (the "Restricted Investments Reallocation"). In cases where a single 
investment thesis or idea is manifested through a group of positions, including related hedges, one 
of which is an investment in a Restricted Company, as a general matter, the Management Company 
will treat the entire group of investments as a Restricted Investment even if certain of the positions 
in the group are not securities or other instruments of Restricted Companies. In certain cases, 
where this general rule results in outcomes the Management Company deems suboptimal, alternate 
rules may be applied. Because Restricted Investments may include hedges (internal and otherwise) 
in the Management Company's discretion, the Restricted Investments Reallocation may result in 
a different allocation of profits and losses to the SRI Investors and the non-SRI Investors than 
would have occurred had there been no hedges (internal or otherwise). The Management Company 
retains complete discretion in determining the methodology used to determine the Restricted 
Investments Reallocation. To the extent the Partnership enters into similar arrangements with 
certain of its Limited Partners (the "Partnership SRI Limited Partners"), the impact of the 
Restricted Investments Reallocation vis a vis the Partnership on the Partnership SRI Limited 
Partners and the Limited Partners who are not SRI Limited Partners will be similar to the impact 
of the Restricted Investments Reallocation discussed above and below. (See "Hedging"). 
The Restricted Investments Reallocation involves a bookkeeping entry relating to the 
investment performance of a subset of the Offshore Fund's portfolio (the "Regular Portfolio") and 
the SRI Shares are not and will not be, managed as a segregated, or even separate, portfolio; that
