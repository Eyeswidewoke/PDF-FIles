Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
• otherwise dispose of any shares of common stock, options or warrants to 
acquire shares of common stock, or securities exchangeable or 
exercisable for or convertible into shares of common stock currently or 
hereafter owned either of record or beneficially, or 
• publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing for a period of 
180 days after the date of this prospectus without the prior 
written consent of Jefferies LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. 
This restriction terminates after the close of trading of the common stock 
on and including the 180th day after the date of this prospectus. 
Jefferies LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may, in their sole discretion 
and at any time or from time to time before the termination of the 
180-day period, release all or any portion of the securities subject to lock-
up agreements. 
Stabilization 
The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, certain persons 
participating in the offering may engage in short sale transactions, 
stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions or the imposition 
of 
penalty bids in connection with this offering. These activities may have the 
effect of stabilizing or maintaining the market price of the common 
stock at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open 
market. Establishing short sales positions may involve either "covered" short 
sales or "naked" short sales. 
"Covered" short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the 
underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of our common 
stock in this offering. The underwriters may close out any covered short 
position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares of 
our common stock or purchasing shares of our common stock in the open 
market. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered short 
position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of 
shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price 
at which they may purchase shares through the option to purchase additional 
shares. 
"Naked" short sales are sales in excess of the option to purchase additional 
shares of our common stock. The underwriters must close out any 
naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short 
position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned 
that there may be downward pressure on the price of the shares of our common 
stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect 
investors who purchase in this offering. 
A stabilizing bid is a bid for the purchase of shares of common stock on 
behalf of the underwriters for the purpose of fixing or maintaining the 
price of the common stock. A syndicate covering transaction is the bid for 
or the purchase of shares of common stock on behalf of the underwriters 
to reduce a short position incurred by the underwriters in connection with 
the offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, the underwriter's 
purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising 
or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or
