Field Test of the Cognitive Interview: Enhancing the Recollection of 
Actual Victims and Witnesses of Crime

The Cognitive Interview was tested in the field to enhance the recollection of actual victims and 
witnesses of crime. The technique is based on laboratory-tested principles of memory retrieval, 
knowledge representation, and communication. Seven experienced detectives from the Metro-Dade 
Police Department were trained to use the technique and were compared with 9 untrained detec-
tives. Before and after training, all detectives tape-recorded interviews with victims and witnesses of 
crime. The trained detectives elicited 47% more information after than before training, and 63% 
more information than did the untrained detectives. Overall collaboration rates (94%) were ex-
tremely high and were equivalent for pre- and postuained interviews. Because the Cognitive Inter-
view reliably enhances memory and is easily learned and administered, it should be useful for a 
variety of investigathe interviews. 
Sanders (1986) asked sheriff's' deputies and detectives across 
New Mork, "What is the central and most important feature of 
criminal investigations?" The majority of respondents an-
swered, "Eyewitnesses." Nevertheless, few reported that they 
had any training in interviewing witnesses. Even though many 
studies have sought to document and give theoretical explana-
tions for the fallibility of witness memory (see Goodman & 
Hahn, 1987; Loftus, 1979; Yarmcy, 1979, for reviews), only re-
cently has research been conducted on police interview tech-
niques to increase the completeness of a witness's report (e.g., 
Wells, 1988). 
One dramatic technique for eyewitness memory enhance-
ment is hypnosis. Hypnosis has been reported to be useful in 
criminal cases, especially with traumatized witnesses (Reiser, 
1980). Enhanced memory under hypnosis has also been found 
in some controlled laboratory experiments. In many studies, 
however, researchers have found no memory enhancement with 
hypnosis. On the whole, the evidence about memory under hyp-
nosis is mixed (see Sanders & Simmons. 1983; Smith, 1983, for 
reviews). Of greater practical consequence is that some re-
searchers have concluded that hypnosis may distort the memory 
process (see Geiselman & Machlovitz, 1987; Orne, Soskis, 
Dinges, & Orne, 1984). As a result of the inconsistency in the 
empirical literature, and as a general safeguard against the po-
tential problems encountered with memory under hypnosis,

several U.S. states have placed restrictions on the admissibility 
of hypnosis recall in a court of law. 
In response to the need to improve police interview tech-
niques and to avoid the legal problems of hypnosis, Geiselman 
and Fisher (Geiselman, Fisher, Cohen, Holland, & Suites, 1986; 
Geiselman, Fisher, Firstenberg, Hutton, Sullivan, Avetissian, & 
Prosk, 1984; Geiselman, Fisher, MacKinnon, & Holland, 1985) 
developed a nonhypnotic interview procedure based on gener-
ally accepted scientific principles of memory.' The resulting 
procedure, called the Cognitive Interview, is a set of instruc-
tions given by the interviewer to the witness at the beginning of 
the interview. The goals of these instructions are (a) to encour-
age the witness to reinstate the context of the original event and 
(b) to search through memory by using a variety of retrieval 
routes (see Geiselman et al., 1985, for specific details). The Cog-
nitive Interview was compared with standard police interview 
techniques in three laboratory experiments under highly realis-
tic conditions (e.&, using police films of simulated crimes). 
Overall, the Cognitive Interview elicited approximately 25%-
35% more information than did the standard police interview, 
without generating any more incorrect information (Geiselman 
et al., 1984. 1985; Geiselman, Fishes Cohen, et al., 1986). We 
then refined the technique on the basis of insights gained from 
analyzing tape-recorded field interviews2 (Fisher, Geiselman, & 
Raymond, 1987). In the revised version, which was evaluated 
in the present study. we approached the eyewitness's problem 
from the following three perspectives. representation of know!.
