questions of worker policing. Inclusive fitness theory assumes that 
each individual contributes a separate, well-defined portion of 
fitness to itself and to every other individual. It has been shown 
repeatedly (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman. 1978; Uyenoyama and 
Feldman, 1982; Matessi and Karlin. 1984; Nowak ct al., 2010; van 
Veelen et al.. 2014). that this assumption does not hold for general 
evolutionary processes. Therefore, inclusive fitness is a limited 
concept that does not exist in most biological situations. 
Our work shows that the evolution of worker policing depends 
on the effectiveness of egg removal (pz) and the consequences of 
colony efficiency (r2). Each of these effects can be nonlinear (not 
the sum of contributions from separate individuals), with impor-
tant consequences for the fate of a policing allele. Moreover, the 
invasion and stability conditions involve the product of p- and r-
values, indicating a nontrivial interaction between these two 
effects which does not reduce to a simple sum of costs and ben-
efits. We also found that there are separate conditions for invasion 
and stability. with neither implying the other. Inclusive fitness 
theory, which posits a single, linear condition for the success of a 
trait, is not equipped to deal with these considerations. 
Attempts to extend inclusive fitness theory to more general 
evolutionary processes (Queller. 1992; Frank. 1983; Gardner et al.. 
2011) rely on the incorrect interpretation of linear regression 
coefficients (Allen et al.. 2013; see also Birch and Okasha. 2014). 
This misuse of statistical inference tools is unique to inclusive 
fitness theory. and differs from legitimate uses of linear regression 
in quantitative genetics and other areas of science. It was also 
recently discovered that even in situations where inclusive fitness 
does exist, it can give the wrong result as to the direction of nat-
ural selection (Tarnita and Taylor, 2014). 
Relatedness-based arguments are often seen in conjunction 
with inclusive fitness but there is a crucial difference. Consider the 
following statement: if the queen is singly mated, then workers 
share more genetic material with sons of other workers than with 
sons of the queen. This statement is not wrong and could be useful 
in formulating evolutionary hypotheses. Such hypotheses can then 
be checked using exact mathematical methods. 
The problem arises when one attempts to formulate the 
quantity of inclusive fitness by partitioning fitness into contribu-
tions from different individuals and reassigning these contribu-
tions from recipient to actor. A worker does not make separate 
contributions to fitnesses of others. and therefore does not have 
Inclusive fitness". Arguments such as "the worker maximizes her 
inclusive fitness by not policing" are meaningless, since they are 
based on maximizing a nonexistent quantity. Moreover, even 
when evolution leads individuals to maximize some quantity, that 
quantity is not necessarily inclusive fitness (Okasha and Martens. 
2015; Lehmann et al., 2015), 
It is true that genes (alleles) can be favored by natural selection 
if they enhance the reproduction of copies of themselves in other 
individuals. But that argument works out on the level of genes and 
can be fully analyzed using population genetics. Inclusive fitness 
only arises when the individual is chosen as the level of analysis. 
which is a problematic choice for many cases of complex family or 
population structure (Akcay and Van Clew. 2016). 
Bourke (20111 has proposed that inclusive fitness remains valid 
as a concept even when it is nonexistent as a quantity. But why is 
such an uninstantiable concept useful? The mathematical theory of 
evolution is clear and powerful. Exact calculations of evolutionary 
dynamics (Antal et al.. 2009; Allen and Nowak. 2014; Fu et al.. 2014; 
Haven and Doebelt, 2004; Szabo and Kith. 2007; Antal and 
Scheming. 2006; Traulsen et al., 2008; van Veelen et al.. 2014; 
Simon ct al.. 2013) demonstrate that inclusive fitness is not needed 
for understanding any phenomenon in evolutionary biology. This 
realization is good news for all whose primary goal is to understand 
evolution rather than to insist on a particular method of analysis. By 
releasing ourselves from the confines of a mathematically limited 
theory, we expand the possibilities of scientific discovery. 
it Discussion 
We have derived analytical conditions for the invasion and 
stability of policing in situations where queens mate once or 
several times and where colony efficiency can be affected by 
policing. In the special case where policing has no effect on colony 
efficiency, our results confirm the traditional view that policing 
does not evolve for single mating, is neutral for double mating, and 
does evolve for triple mating or more than three matings. If colony 
efficiency depends linearly or monotonically on the fraction of 
workers that are policing, then our results support the view that 
multiple mating is favorable to evolution of policing (Ratnieks. 
1988). Our results also show that non-monotonic relations in 
colony dynamics and small changes in colony efficiency necessi-
tate a more careful analysis. 
We find that policing can evolve in species with singly mated 
queens if it causes minute increases in colony efficiency. We find 
that policing does not evolve in species with multiply mated 
queens if it causes minute decreases in colony efficiency. For non-
monotonic efficiency functions, it is possible that single mating 
allows evolution of policing while multiple mating opposes evo-
lution of policing. 
Our analysis is the first to give precise conditions for both the 
invasion and stability of policing for both dominant and recessive 
mutations that effect policing. We study the evolutionary invasion 
and evolutionary stability of policing both analytically and 
numerically. For any number of matings, there are four possible 
outcomes (see Fig. 5): (i) policing can invade and is stable; (ii) 
policing can invade but is unstable, leading to coexistence; (iii) 
policing cannot invade but is stable, leading to bistability; (iv) 
policing cannot invade and is unstable. We give precise conditions 
for all outcomes for both dominant and recessive police alleles. All 
outcomes can be achieved with arbitrarily small changes in colony 
efficiency. 
Our calculations are not based on any assumption about the 
strength of phenotypic mutation induced by an allele. The condi-
tions I . 
. 91. and (10) also describe the dynamics of mutations 
that have an arbitrarily small phenotypic effect on colony 
dynamics. This facilitates investigation of the evolution of complex 
social behaviors that result from gradual accumulation of many 
mutations (Kapheim et al.. 2016). We derive a simple relation. Eq. 
(17), for the location(s) of evolutionarily singular strategies. We 
also derive precise conditions for a singular strategy to be an ESS. 
These results are applicable for understanding both the case of 
weak phenotypic effect and the case of weak penetrance. 
Our analysis does not use inclusive fitness theory. Given the 
known limitations of inclusive fitness (Nowak et al.. 2010; Allen et 
al.. 2013). it is unlikely that inclusive fitness theory could provide a 
general framework for analyzing the evolution of worker policing. 
In summary, the main conclusions of our paper are: (i) The 
prevalent relatedness-based argument that policing evolves under 
multiple mating but not under single mating is not robust with 
respect to arbitrarily small variations in colony efficiency; (ii) for 
non-monotonic efficiency functions, it is possible that policing 
evolves for single mating, but not for double or triple mating; (iii) 
careful measurements of colony efficiency and the fraction of 
queen-derived males are needed to understand how natural 
selection acts on policing; (iv) contrary to what has been claimed 
(Abbot et al.. 2011), the phenomenon of worker policing is no 
empirical confirmation of inclusive fitness theory: the first two 
mathematical papers on worker policing (Woyacchowski and 
lomnicki. 1987; Ratnieks. 1988) do not use inclusive fitness theory.
