Subject: 
Evaluation 
Jeffery, my dear friend, this will be the last time I write on this matter =ecause, as I have told you, I have turned the 
management of the issue over=to Frank Garrison who has sole authority. I have done so in consideration =f the many 
conflicts for me inherent in this dispute. 
At your request I have done some more homework including having looked at t=e page in the appraisal to which you 
referred me. Not only does my positio= stand, but it has been materially reinforced. 
The appraisal on which you now appear to be relying to demonstrate that you=were somehow harmed was performed 
in connection with a valuation of AYH al=ne, commissioned by Banco Popular, 6 months after the asset was 
purchased.=The pertinent language of the appraisal to which you directed me states, "=he subject was part of a larger 
purchase of four marina properties in the =aribbean. The seller was Sun Resorts which owned the subject outright 
and=various interests in the other three marinas. The sale price is slightly =igher than our value estimate which could be 
the result of allocated costs=of the portfolio sale." This presumption by the appraiser is inaccurate a=d thus misleading 
and erroneous in several aspects. 
1) The appraiser had absolutely no knowledge of the structure, pricing or c=mponents of the Sun Resorts deal nor did he 
do any evaluation of any facts=related to it. His work was limited exclusively to a valuation of AYH alon=. While he states 
that the sale price is "...slightly higher than our valu= estimate which COULD [emphasis added] be the result of allocated 
costs o= the portfolio sale," the comment is entirely gratuitous. The appraiser di= zero work around the so called, 
"portfolio sale," had no knowledge of its=terms, conditions, pricing or structure and read no documents. His gratuit=us 
statement that the pricing COULD have been a function of "allocated cos=s" was a flat out guess with zero basis in fact. 
The term "portfolio sale"=is quite misleading and, as explained below, the various assets were sold =y different sellers 
with very separate and disparate interests. 
2) IGY bought several things from Sun Resorts. It bought a management comp=ny and it bought interests in (and/or 
bought outright) marina properties e=ch of which was owned by an individual limited partnership with each partn=rship, 
in turn, owned by different limited partners. Sun Resorts owned th= GP interests, but in each case the sale of the 
properties by the partners=ips required the affirmative vote of the majority of the limited partners =n each deal. In the 
case of AYH in particular, the appraisal also erroneou=ly states that Sun Resorts, "....owned the subject outright." That is 
not =ccurate. Sun Resorts owned the managing member interest in a limited partn=rship that owned the subject 
outright. Even if Sun Resorts had wanted to i= had no ability to allocate costs or benefits between and among assets as 
=ach thing it sold had different shareholders. 
3) The majority limited partners of the entity owning AYH was the Crown Fam=Iy. Crown family members and their 
representatives personally participated=in the pricing negotiations around this asset. The price was reached as a =esult 
of these arms-length negotiations and no inappropriate allocations o= any sort were made or attributed to the 
acquisition to increase the price= Even Sun Resorts deferred to the Crowns in this regard. 
4) Each of the assets we acquired from Sun was individually priced and indi=idually negotiated and each sale was subject 
to a vote by the different an= disparate sets of limited partners in each partnership owning an asset.
