Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
approach model is based on the way a company's management organizes segments 
within the company for making operating decisions and 
assessing performance. We have identified two operating segments: United 
States and Brazil. The Company's joint venture in Mexico is included 
in the United States for segment reporting purposes as the operations of the 
joint venture are monitored by the United States segment management. 
Operations in the United States accounted for 84% and 80% of total 
consolidated revenue for the first fiscal quarters of Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 
2014, respectively, and 76% and 74% of total consolidated revenue for the 
fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, 
respectively. The remaining revenue was attributable to our Brazilian 
subsidiary. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
We review property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for 
impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets may 
not be recoverable. Factors considered include, significant underperformance 
relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, 
significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the 
strategy for the overall business and significant negative industry or 
economic 
trends. The recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying value of 
the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the 
asset. If impairment exists, the amount of impairment is measured as the 
excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value, as determined 
by each location's projected future discounted cash flows. This assessment 
process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future 
cash flows and estimated useful lives, which are subject to a significant 
degree of judgment. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be 
required to record impairment charges for these assets. We have not recorded 
any impairment related to long-lived assets in any of the periods 
presented. 
Revenue 
Revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products 
are sold and is presented net of employee meals and 
complimentary meals. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards that do not have 
expiration dates are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of the sale 
and recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed by the holder. The 
portion of gift cards sold which are never redeemed is commonly 
referred to as gift card breakage. We recognize gift card "breakage" revenue 
for gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and 
we determine there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the 
unredeemed gift cards to governmental agencies. We estimate the gift card 
breakage rate based upon the pattern of historical redemptions. Prior to the 
third quarter of Fiscal 2014, we did not recognize any breakage revenue 
because we did not have sufficient historical data to allow management to 
reasonably estimate a pattern of historical redemptions. During the third 
quarter of Fiscal 2014, we concluded we had accumulated sufficient 
historical data from a large pool of homogeneous transactions to allow 
management to reasonably and objectively determine an estimated pattern of
