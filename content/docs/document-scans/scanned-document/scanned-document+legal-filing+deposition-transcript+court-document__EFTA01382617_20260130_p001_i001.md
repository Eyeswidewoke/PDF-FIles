S-I/A 
Table of Con teat 
upon exercise of vested options. As soon as practicable following this offering, we intend to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 
under the Securities Act to register all shares of common stock subject to outstanding stock options under the 2007 Equity Plan (as defined herein) 
and 71,182,033 shares and 6,327,292 shares of Class A common stock subject to issuance under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, iespectively, to be adopted in connection with this offering. Any shares of Class13 common stock subject to 
outstanding awards granted under the 2007 Equity Plan that, after the effective date of the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, are forfeited, terminated. 
cancelled, expire unexercised, withheld in payment of the exercise price or withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations, which shares of Class B 
common stock will automatically be converted on a one-for-one basis into shares of Class A common stock, will also be subject to issuance under 
the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Any such Form S-8 registration statements will automatically become effective upon filing. Once these shares 
are registered. they can be sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by 
affiliates. 
Upon the expiration of the lock-up agreements described above, 545.913,661 shares would be subject to volume, manner of sale and 
other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined in "Certain Relationships and Related 
Party Transactions—Registration Rights Agreement"), we have granted KKR the right to cause us, in certain instances. at our expense. to file 
registration statements under the Securities Act covering resales of our common stock it beneficially owns. By exercising its registration rights and 
selling a large number of shares, KKR could cause the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock to decline. Following completion of 
this offering, the shares covered by registration rights would represent approximately 61% of our total common stock outstanding (or 59%, if the 
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares). Registration of any of these outstanding shares of our common stock would 
result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with Rule 144 upon effectiveness of the registration statement. See "Shares 
Eligible for Future Sale." 
As restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights. the market price of our shams of Class A common 
stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could 
also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of Class A common stock or other securities. 
In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our Class A 
common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our 
Class A common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to 
you. 
The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with KKR; this will limit or prechtde your ability to 
influence corporate matters. 
Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock, which is the stock we are selling in this offering. 
has one vote per share. Stockholders who beneficially own shares of Class B common stock, including KKR and certain other stockholders, will 
together control approximately 98% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock following this offering. Because of the ten-to-one voting 
ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of 
the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders so long as the shares of 
Class B common stock represent at least 10% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrate) control will 
limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. 
Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject 
to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected to permitted transferees or for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of 
Class B common stock to Class A common stock
