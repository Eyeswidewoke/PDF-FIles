had exercise prices lower than the fair value of the Company's common 
stock. 
During the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013, the Company granted options 
for the purchase of 10,500 shares of common stock at a 
weighted average exercise price of $265.68. These options have performance-
based vesting conditions relating to a Liquidity Event. As the 
completion of a Liquidity Event cannot be considered probable until it 
occurs, no expense associated with these awards will be recorded until the 
Liquidity Event occurs.

610 shares under the 2012 Plan with an exercise price of 
$205.14. The fair value of each option on the date of grant was $79.59. 
These options were fully vested and exercisable immediately upon grant to 
the individuals. As there is no other time, performance or market conditions 
related to these stock options, the Company recognized the full $58 of 
compensation expense associated with these awards during the fiscal year 
ended December 29, 2013. 
During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014, the Company granted options 
for the purchase of 9,800 shares of common stock at a 
weighted average exercise price of $308.37. These options have performance-
based vesting conditions relating to a Liquidity Event. As the 
completion of a Liquidity Event cannot be considered probable until it 
occurs, no expense associated with these awards will be recorded until the 
Liquidity Event occurs. 
In December 2014, the Company granted stock options for the purchase of 91 
shares under the 2012 Plan with an exercise price of $274.54. 
The fair value of each option on the date of grant was $85.46. These options 
were fully vested and exercisable immediately upon grant to the 
individual. As there is no other time, performance or market conditions 
related to these stock options, the Company recognized the full $8 of 
compensation expense associated with these awards during the fiscal year 
ended December 28, 2014. 
The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during 
the period from May 24, 2012 to December 30, 2012 (successor
