General Risk Factors 
General Economic Conditions. Significant risks may exist for the Issuer 
and investors in the Notes as a result of uncertain general economic 
conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, on 
or after the Closing Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be 
sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase 
price, (ii) the illiquidity of the Notes, as there may be no secondary 
trading in the Notes and (iii) the possibility of a decline in the market 
value of the Notes. These risks may affect the returns on the Notes to 
investors and the ability of investors to realize their investment in the 
Notes prior to the Stated Maturity, if at all. In addition, the primary 
market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans may be 
volatile, and the level of new issuances may be uncertain and may vary based 
on a number of factors, including general economic conditions. As well as 
reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary 
market, this may increase reinvestment or refinancing risk in respect of 
maturing Collateral Obligations. These additional risks may affect the 
returns on the Notes to investors and could further slow, delay or reverse 
an economic recovery and cause a further deterioration in loan performance 
generally. Limitations on the amount of available credit in the market may 
have an adverse impact on general economic conditions that affect the 
performance of the Assets. The slowdown in growth or commencement of a 
recession would be expected to have an adverse effect on the ability of 
businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt. Adverse macroeconomic 
conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realization 
value of the Assets. It is possible that the Assets will experience higher 
default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer. 
The market value and performance of the Collateral Obligations and the Notes 
may be adversely impacted by current and future economic conditions, 
including perceptions of potential, current or future conditions, market 
trading imbalances or technical dislocation. To the extent that economic 
and business conditions fail to improve or deteriorate further, the levels 
of defaults and delinquencies are likely to increase and market values may 
decrease or not fully recover, which may adversely affect the amount of Sale 
Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations 
and could adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the 
Notes. 
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an 
adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is 
the administrative agent of a leveraged loan or is a selling institution 
with respect to a participation. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency or 
financial distress of one or more additional financial institutions, or one 
or more sovereigns, may trigger additional crises in the global credit 
markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on 
the Issuer, the Assets and the Notes. 
Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer. Barclays is under no 
obligation to create or maintain a secondary market in the Notes. There is 
currently no market for the Notes and it is unlikely that a secondary market 
for the Notes will develop. Additionally, the Notes will not be registered
