drugs in the context of dog and cat foods (1) that provided nutrients in 
support of the animal's total required daily nutrient needs, (2) that were 
distributed only through licensed veterinarians and (3) with respect to 
which manufacturers restricted labeling claims. However, noting an increase 
in the number of dog and cat foods labeled as being intended for use in the 
diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, and 
noting that animal health may suffer when such products are not subject to 
pre-market FDA approval and are provided in the absence of a valid 
veterinarian-client-patient relationship, the FDA recently issued a list of 
specific factors it will consider in determining whether to initiate 
enforcement action against products that satisfy the definitions of both an 
animal food and an animal drug, but which do not comply with the 
regulatory requirements applicable to animal drugs. We currently produce 
products, such as cat food with hairball management, that undergo FDA 
pre-market inspection. While we believe that we market our products in 
accordance with the applicable FDA regulatory requirements, the FDA 
may classify some of our products differently than we do and may impose more 
stringent regulations applicable to animal drugs, such as 
requirements for pre-market approval and compliance with GMPs for the 
manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. We intend to produce more 
products that we anticipate will be subject to FDA pre-market inspection, 
including new products to the Therapeutic market segment. 
Under Section 423 of the FFDCA, the FDA may require the recall of an animal 
feed product if there is a reasonable probability that the 
product is adulterated or misbranded and the use of or exposure to the 
product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition, 
pet food manufacturers may voluntarily recall or withdraw their products 
from the market. In 2010, we voluntarily issued a recall of certain of our 
products due to possible excess Vitamin D present in specific production 
runs caused by an error occurring at a supplier. 
Most states also enforce their own labeling regulations, many of which are 
based on model definitions and guidelines developed by 
AAFCO. AAFCO is a voluntary, non-governmental membership association of 
local, state and federal agencies that are charged with regulation of 
the sale and distribution of animal feed, including pet foods. The degree of 
oversight of the implementation of these regulations varies by state, but 
typically includes a state review and approval of each product label as a 
condition of sale in that state. 
Most states require that pet foods distributed in the state be registered or 
licensed with the appropriate state regulatory agency. In 
addition, most facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods, 
including pet foods, must register with the FDA and must renew their 
registration every two years. This includes most foreign, as well as 
domestic facilities. Registration must occur before the facility begins its 
pet 
food manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding operations. 
In 2011, the FSMA was enacted. The FSMA mandates, among other things, that 
the FDA adopt preventative controls to be implemented 
by pet food facilities in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food
