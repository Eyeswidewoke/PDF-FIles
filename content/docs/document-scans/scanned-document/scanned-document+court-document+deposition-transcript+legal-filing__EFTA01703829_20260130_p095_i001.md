among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sole discretion Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We Use the ADS 
Method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature(including current transactions). Different daily 
periodic rates may te applied to separate Feature balanceS To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous billing penods) (2) add any new transactions, debts, or fees (3) 
subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day atter the first day of the billing 
period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous days daily balance multiphed by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the ADB for the Feature_ If you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in the billing period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total FC for the 
billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account. The method of calculating the ADB 
and FC Melia" in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a 
foreign currency, it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us Or Our agents. Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that is aoceplade to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified lw us from customary banking sources, on the 
conversion dale or the pnor business day, In each Instance increased by 2%. This conversion rate may differ from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such 
establishments use. Billing Rights Summery:  In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill: II you think your bill is 
incorrect, or if you need more information about atransaction on your till, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the
