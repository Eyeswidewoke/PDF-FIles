or make something, that changes the 
way people think or behave. Many of the 
biggest discoveries—the most important 
scientifically, and the most consequential 
socially—are surprises, and their conse-
quences are unimaginable at the time 
they are made. Who would have pre-
dicted the changes in society that have 
come from classification of the elements 
into the periodic table, or from quantum 
mechanics, or the world wide web? Who 
could have guessed that the first NMR 
spectrum of ethanol would grow into the 
ability to watch the brain think? 
The unpredictability of these big 
surprises makes us timid in our spec-
ulations: it is embarrassing to be pub-
licly wrong, and big surprises make 
dunces of us all. But, avoiding specula-
tion makes science dreary, and neglects 
our responsibility to society to warn of 
change. even as we cause it. 
Picking Assumptions, Not Making 
Predictions 
In speculating about the future, 
we—scientists and nonscientists—are 
really interested in knowing what the 
science and technology will be that will 
make a big difference, and in knowing 
whether that difference will be good, or 
bad, or both, or a matter of context, or 
circumstance, or personal opinion. 
The process of starting with current 
science, extrapolating it into the future. 
and then guessing how society will use 
or abuse this future science is so un-
certain it will probably fail. I suggest 
that a different and perhaps more direct 
approach to identifying where science 
might reshape society is to start by 
identifying areas where change would 
matter, and then ask if imaginable sci-
ence might cause this change. 
How are we to identify areas where 
society is vulnerable to change? Or 
where the push of a new idea or a new 
technology might topple established in-
stitutions? I propose that we begin by 
identifying the assumptions that our 
society makes, and then ask about the 
vulnerability of these assumptions in the 
face of plausible science. 
An assumption is an idea that is 
taken for granted: it tacitly separates the 
imaginable from the unimaginable. If an 
assumption is vulnerable, then the prob-
blew. Cheat tat. Ed. 2004, 43. 3632-360 
ability that it will eventually fracture—
for better or worse—under the blows of 
science is very high. Let me give an 
example. We assume, as an ankle of 
faith—a deeply held assumption—that 
we arc the most intelligent entities on 
the planet. We would certainly be dis-
concerted to discover that science and 
technology had generated an entity 
more intelligent than we: a peer com-
petitor (or perhaps a peer partner, 
although, as a species, we have never 
been good at "sharing"). How probable, 
technically, is it that 
science will do so? The 
answer to this question 
depends on whether 
you believe that intelli-
gence is an oddity char-
acteristic 
of 
highly 
evolved living organisms (humans, por-
poises, whales, chimpanzees), or wheth-
er it is inevitable in (or perhaps can be 
engineered into) any information-proc-
essing system of sufficient complexity. 
So, will information science produce 
intelligent machines? (... and what is 
"intelligence" in a machine, anyway?) I 
don't know, but I (and others more 
knowledgeable than I) also don't know 
that it is impossible. Hence it is an area 
that we, and society, should watch care-
fully. 
Where, in the past. has science dis-
solved important assumptions with pro-
found consequences for society? Failed 
assumptions are easy to identify in 
hindsight: they are the facts of daily life 
that we now accept as routine, but that 
would, at some earlier time, have pro-
voked a reaction of "impossible!" If one 
had asked Frederick the Great or Sun 
Tsu if it would ever be possible utterly to 
destroy a city on the other side of the 
globe in a single stroke, their answer 
would have been "Nor They. and their 
societies, assumed this limitation to the 
art of war. We now accept as unremark-
able a world in which science and 
technology—born as quantum mechan-
ics and grown to be nuclear-tipped 
intercontinental 
ballistic 
missiles 
(ICBMs; or perhaps just a rental truck 
containing an amateur's fully functional 
fission bomb)—make this single stroke 
distressingly possible. The failure of this 
assumption has changed society. 
We have discarded many other as-
sumptions, with consequences both

good and bad. At one time, knowledge 
could be passed on only through speech: 
the written word and moveable type 
gave our society a long-term memory. 
At one time it was impossible to talk to 
or to see others over long distances; the 
telephone. radio. TV, and the web are 
now among the threads that hold society 
together. Controlling human fertility 
fundamentally changed the relation of 
women to society. Society changes when 
it discards a major assumption. 
Thinking about assumptions and 
working backward is 
not necessarily less falli-
ble than thinking about 
science and working for-
wards, but it tends to 
focus more on big soci-
etal problems and less 
on small technological evolutions. Con-
centrating on assumptions might. there-
fore, provide better advance warning 
about issues that the scientific commun-
ity (and society) should consider care-
fully than extrapolating from existing 
science. It would also accomplish four 
other ends It would: 1) show that the 
dreary intellectual senescence suggested 
by John Horgan's stimulating book "The 
End of Science" is wrong-headed: 
2) identify directions where science 
would unquestionably have large im-
pact; 3) indicate especially interesting 
problems on which scientists might 
work; and 4) suggest new ways of doing 
business: big problems do not have 
disciplinary 
boundaries—academic 
departments do. 
In what follows, I list nine assump-
tions that. I believe, are fundamental to 
western society, and that, I believe, are 
vulnerable to disproof by science. This 
list is entirely personal: others would 
make other lists. These assumptions are 
different in nature: some are conceptu-
al, some are practical, and some are 
sociological. 
Society changes when 
it discards a major 
assumption. 
Where Does Chemistry Fit In? 
Chemistry has had a wonderful peri-
od of two centuries in which it revolu-
tionized the understanding and manip-
ulation of the physical world: it revealed 
the atomic and molecular structure of 
matter, and provided physical things—
drugs, clothing, fuels, weapons. materi-
