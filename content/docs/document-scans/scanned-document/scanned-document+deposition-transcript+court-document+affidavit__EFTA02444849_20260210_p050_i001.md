Psychosomatic Relations: From 
Superstition to Mortality 
People have many sources of 
information, knowledge and 
s The lead author is Gary G. Benison, Ph.D., a 
Professor of Psychology, Psychiatry and 
Pediatrics and a member of the Neurosciences 
Graduate Faculty at the Ohio State University. 
He is a co-founder (with John Cacioppo) of the 
field of social neuroscience, is a co-editor of the 
Handbook of Psychophysiology and the 
Handbook of Neuroscience for the Behavioral 
Sciences, and is the President of the Society for 
Psychophysiological Research. Benison's 
research focuses on the evolutionary 
development of the neuraxis, with special regard 
to levels of organization in neurobehavioral 
systems, affective processes and autonomic 
regulation. He has published over 200 articles in 
scientific outlets and six books. 
Benison begins with the fact that 
knowledge, thoughts and beliefs can influence 
our behaviors. Behaviors, of course, are 
physiological processes entailing neural 
operations and muscular actions. Here we see a 
clear intersection between the psychological 
domain on the one hand (knowledge, thoughts 
and beliefs) and the physical domain 
(neuromuscular effector systems) on the other. 
But mind-body relations extend beyond the 
observable actions or skeletal muscles. The mind 
and its organ, the brain, also impact powerfully 
on internal bodily functions associated with the 
autonomic nervous system, the endocrine 
system, and the immune system, to name just a 
few. Through these interactions, psychological 
processes can be translated in outcomes that have 
powerful significance for adaptation and health. 
Benison explores the processes by which 
thoughts can manifest in fundamental changes in 
internal physiology and health. 
understanding. We consider the most 
common of these to be empirically 
acquired, learned facts, relations, 
associations, and perceptual and motor 
skills. Such learned associations serve as 
powerful determinants of thought and 
behavior. But other sources of 
information and knowledge also affect 
our interaction with the environment, 
including reflex-like (constitutionally 
endowed) circuits that are independent 
of explicit teaming. Examples include 
central networks for pain withdrawal, 
hunger circuits for the ingestion of 
essential nutrients, social affiliation 
networks, and neural systems that 
promote maternal bonding. Each of 
these sources of information or 
knowledge can impact thoughts and 
beliefs, and thoughts and beliefs can 
impact behaviors and other bodily 
functions. 
"...a Maori woman who, 
having eaten somc fruit, was told that it 
had been taken 
from a tabooed place; she 
exclaimed that the sanctity of the chief 
had been profaned 
and that his spirit would kill 
her ... the next day ... she was 
dead.11) 
"I have seen a strong young 
man die .... the same day he was tapued 
(tabooed); the victims die 
under it as though their strength ran out 
as water... "( I ) 
A superstition is a belief, based 
not on reason or knowledge, but on 
legend, magical thinking, or other non-
rational basis. Beliefs color the way we 
perceive the world, they direct and shape 
our actions, and define our personalities. 
Beliefs are powerful determinants of 
action. A useful illustration of the power 
of beliefs comes from the parable of the
