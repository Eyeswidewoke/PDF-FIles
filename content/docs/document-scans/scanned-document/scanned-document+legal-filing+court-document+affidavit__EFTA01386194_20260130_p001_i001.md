AGP LP 519 Alpha Group Capital Paul Barrett 
other manner which the General Partner determines is fair and equitable under the circumstances to all 
clients, including the Partnership. From the standpoint of the Partnership, simultaneous identical portfolio 
transactions for the Partnership and the other clients may tend to decrease the prices received, and 
increase the prices required to be paid, by the Partnership for its portfolio sales and purchases. Where less 
than the maximum desired number of shares of a particular security to be purchased is available at a 
favorable price, the shares purchased will be allocated among the Partnership and the other clients in an 
equitable manner as determined by the General Partner. 
In addition, purchase and sale transactions (including swaps) may be effected between the 
Partnership and other clients subject to the following guidelines: (i) such transactions shall be effected for 
cash consideration at the current market price of the particular securities, and (ii) no brokerage commission 
reallocation (except for customary transfer fees) or other remuneration shall be paid in connection with any 
such transaction. 
The Partnership bears its own expenses as described in Section 6 above. Each advisory client of 
the Investment Manager or its affiliates bears its own expenses as set forth in its respective investment 
management agreement or other governing document. Expenses borne by the other clients may differ from 
the expenses borne by the Partnership. In certain instances, the Partnership may bear expenses that the 
Investment Manager or its affiliates have agreed to bear for one or more of its other clients. In other 
instances, the other clients may bear expenses that the Investment Manager or its affiliates have agreed to 
bear for the Partnership. 
Where expenses are incurred on behalf of the Partnership and one or more other clients, the 
Investment Manager seeks to allocate those expenses among the Partnership and the other clients in a 
manner that is fair and reasonable over time. The Investment Manager may use a variety of methods to 
allocate such common expenses among the Partnership and the other clients, including methods based on 
assets under management, relative use of a product or service, the nature or source of a product or service, 
the relative benefits derived by the Partnership and the other clients from a product or service, or other 
relevant factors. It is possible that the Investment Manager will allocate an expense to the Partnership for a 
particular product or service that does not reflect the relative benefit derived by the Partnership from that 
product or service. 
As a result of the foregoing, the Affiliated Parties may have conflicts of interest in allocating their 
time and activity between the Partnership and other entities, in allocating investments among the 
Partnership and other entities and in effecting transactions for the Partnership and other entities, including 
ones in which the Affiliated Parties may have a greater financial interest. It may not always be possible or 
consistent with the investment objectives of the various persons or entities described above and of the 
Partnership for the same investment positions to be taken or liquidated at the same time or same price. 
Disaster, Business Continuity and Cyber-Security Risk 
The occurrence of a disaster such as a cyber-attack, a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a 
terrorist attack or war, events unanticipated in the Partnership, Master Fund or Investment Manager's 
disaster recovery systems, or a support failure from external providers, could have an adverse effect on the 
Partnership's ability to conduct business and on the Partnership's operations and financial condition, 
particularly if those events affect the Partnership's, Master Fund's or Investment Manager's 
computer-based data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems, or if these events destroy 
data. If a significant number of the Investment Manager's employees were unavailable in the event of a 
disaster, the Partnership's ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. 
The Investment Manager (and its affiliates) relies upon secure information technology systems for 
data processing, storage and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation and 
updating, the Investment Manager's (and its affiliates) information technology systems could become 
subject to cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital 
systems (e.g., through "hacking" or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or 
sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried
