affected by a challenging economic climate, including adverse changes in 
interest rates, volatile commodity markets and inflation, contraction in 
the availability of credit in the market and reductions in consumer 
spending. In addition, a slow-down in the general economy or a shift in 
consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional, local or 
Private Label products or other less expensive products may result in 
reduced demand for our products which may affect our profitability. The 
keeping of pets and the purchase of pet-related products may constitute 
discretionary spending for some of our consumers and any material decline in 
the amount of consumer discretionary spending may reduce overall 
levels of pet ownership or spending on pets. As a result, a challenging 
economic climate may cause a decline in demand for our products which 
could be disproportionate as compared to competing pet food brands since our 
products command a price premium. In addition, we cannot predict 
how current or worsening economic conditions will affect our retail 
partners, suppliers and distributors. If economic conditions result in 
decreased 
spending on pets and have a negative impact on our retail partners, 
suppliers or distributors, our business, financial condition and results of 
operations may be materially adversely affected. 
Our business depends, in part, on the sufficiency and effectiveness of our 
marketing and trade promotion programs. 
Due to the highly competitive nature of our industry, we must effectively 
and efficiently promote and market our products through 
television, internet and print advertisements as well as trade promotions 
and incentives to sustain our competitive position in our market. Marketing 
investments may be costly. In addition, we may, from time to time, change 
our marketing strategies and spending, including the timing or nature of 
our trade promotions and incentives. We may also change our marketing 
strategies and spending in response to actions by our competitors and 
other pet food companies. For instance, starting in the second half of 2013, 
the largest pet food company in the United States initiated a significant 
increase in its promotional spending, which resulted in other pet food 
companies, including us, increasing their own promotional spending. The 
sufficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and trade promotions and 
incentives are important to our ability to retain and/or improve our market 
share and margins. If our marketing and trade promotions and incentives are 
not successful or if we fail to implement sufficient and effective 
marketing and trade promotions and incentives or adequately respond to 
changes in our competitors' marketing strategies, our business, financial 
condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
If we are unable to maintain or increase prices, our margins may decrease. 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to persuade consumers to 
purchase our branded products, which generally command a price 
premium as compared to prices of Engineered and Private Label products. Some 
products in the Engineered market segment may be labeled as 
"natural" in accordance with the AAFCO regulatory definition even though 
they do not satisfy all the requirements of the Wholesome Natural 
market segment. These products are often priced lower than ours and even if
