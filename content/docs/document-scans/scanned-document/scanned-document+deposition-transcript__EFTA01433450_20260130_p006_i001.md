that a court determine whether a defendant had the "minimum contacts" with 
the forum necessary for the defendant to have "reasonably anticipated being 
haled into court there." World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 297, 100 S.Ct. 
559. A finding of minimum contacts demands the demonstration of "'some act 
by which the defendant purposely availed itself of the privilege of 
conducting business within the forum State, thus invoking the protection and 
benefits of its laws.'" Pennzoil Prods. Co. v. Colelli & Assocs., Inc., 149 
F.3d 197, 283 (3d Cir.1998). A plaintiff can meet this burden in one of two 
ways: by establishing specific or general jurisdiction over a defendant. 
Mesalic v. Fiberfloat Corp., 897 F.2d 696, 699 (3d Cir.1990). A court's 
general jurisdiction "is based on the defendant's general business contacts 
with the forum [territory] and permits a court to exercise its power in a 
case where the subject matter of the suit is unrelated to those contacts." 
Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 568 (2d Cir.-
1996). Under this test, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant's 
contacts with the forum jurisdiction are "continuous and systematic." Id. 
I find that this Court has general jurisdiction over the defendants. 
Citibank operated bank branches and marketed and provided banking services 
in the Virgin Islands for years before and after April 1999 and until 2002, 
just months before the commencement of this litigation. On January 31, 2002, 
Citibank closed its last remaining bank branch in the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
and Citibank no longer makes real estate-related loans in the Virgin 
Islands. (Malins Aff. ¶¶ 3-4.) Citibank, however, continues to process its 
outstanding loans here via its Puerto Rican offices, and initiates 
litigation in this Court. (Id. ¶ 5.) All of the foregoing plainly 
demonstrates that Citibank, and Citigroup through Citibank, have 
continuously and systematically conducted business in the Virgin Islands—
including initiating contact with the plaintiffs for the loans that are the 
subject of this litigation—and therefore, are subject to this Court's 
general jurisdiction. See, e.g., Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 84 F.3d at 569 
(finding that "our review of general jurisdiction cases reveals that 
contacts are commonly assessed over a period of years prior to the 
plaintiffs filing of the complaint" and listing cases). Accordingly, I will 
deny the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
Having found that minimum contacts exist, I must decide whether compelling 
these out-of-territory defendants to submit to jurisdiction in the Virgin 
Islands comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial 
justice. Grand Entm't Group, Ltd. v. Star Media Sales, Inc., 988 F.2d 476, 
481 (3d Cir.1993) (citing International Shoe, 326 U.S. 310 at 316, 66 S.Ct. 
154). Applying these considerations here, I find it reasonable to assert 
jurisdiction over Citibank and Citigroup. The burden on the defendants to 
defend this lawsuit in the Virgin Islands is not severe, most of the 
relevant documents have already been filed in this Court and several 
airlines make daily flights connecting New York and St. Thomas. The Virgin 
Islands obviously has a valid interest in protecting its residents from out-
of-state financial institutions. Resolving the case in this Court is just as 
efficient as trying it in New York and there is no evidence that the 
interests of New York or the Virgin Islands would be better served if this 
matter were not litigated in this jurisdiction. See, e.g., Mesalic, 897 F.2d
