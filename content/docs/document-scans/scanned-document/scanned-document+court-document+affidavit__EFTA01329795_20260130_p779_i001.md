the maximum rate per annum permitted by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate") and the 
payment of obligations of Borrower under the Notes, this Agreement, and any and all Security 
Agreements are hereby limited accordingly. If under any circumstances, whether by reason of 
advancement or acceleration of the maturity of the unpaid principal balance hereof or otherwise, 
the aggregate amounts paid on the Notes or pursuant to any Security Agreement or this 
Agreement shall include amounts which by law are deemed interest and would exceed the 
Maximum Rate, Borrower stipulates that payment and collection of such excess amounts shall 
have been and will be deemed to have been the result of a mistake on the part of both Borrower 
and Lender, and Lender shall promptly credit such excess (to the extent only of such payments in 
excess of the Maximum Rate) against the unpaid principal balance on the Notes and any portion 
of such excess payments not capable of being so credited shall be refunded to Borrower.
