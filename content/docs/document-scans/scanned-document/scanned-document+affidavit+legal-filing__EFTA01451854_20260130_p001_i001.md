OFFER TO SELL OR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY INTERESTS IN ANY 
JURISDICTION TO ANY PERSON TO WHOM IT IS UNLAWFUL TO MAKE SUCH OFFER OR 
SOLICITATION IN SUCH JURISDICTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE INTERESTS MAY NOT BE 
OFFERED OR SOLD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AND THIS MEMORANDUM MAY NOT BE 
DISTRIBUTED, IN ANY JURISDICTION, EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEGAL 
REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO SUCH JURISDICTION. 
BY EXECUTING A SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT IN RESPECT OF INTERESTS BEING 
OFFERED HEREBY (A "SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT"), AN INVESTOR (I) AGREES TO BE, 
AND UPON ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION BY THE GENERAL PARTNER SHALL 
BE, BOUND AS A LIMITED PARTNER OF THE APPLICABLE FEEDER FUND BY THE TERMS, 
PROVISIONS AND REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO INTERESTS AND LIMITED PARTNERS 
AS SET FORTH IN THE APPLICABLE LP AGREEMENT, AS SUCH AGREEMENT MAY BE 
AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THE 
TERMS, PROVISIONS AND REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH HEREIN AND THEREIN THAT ARE 
APPLICABLE TO THE APPLICABLE FEEDER FUND, THE GENERAL PARTNER AND THE 
INVESTMENT MANAGER, AS THE CASE MAY BE. 
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN (AND IN ANY SUBSCRIPTION 
AGREEMENT, THE MASTER FUND PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, THE ONSHORE FEEDER 
LP AGREEMENT, THE OFFSHORE FEEDER LP AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER RELATED 
DOCUMENTS) TO THE CONTRARY, EACH INVESTOR (AND EACH REPRESENTATIVE OR 
OTHER AGENT OF EACH SUCH INVESTOR) MAY DISCLOSE TO THEIR ADVISORS

RELEVANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE TAX TREATMENT AND TAX STRUCTURE OF SUCH
