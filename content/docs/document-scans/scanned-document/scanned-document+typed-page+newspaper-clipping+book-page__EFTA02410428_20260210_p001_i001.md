On the Origin of 
Religion 
fr
imi4r-2•46 
• 
To Charles Darwin, the origin of religious 
belief was no mystery. "As soon as the 
important faculties of the imagination, won-
der, and curiosity, together with some power 
of reasoning, had become partially devel-
oped, man would naturally crave to under-
stand what was passing around him, and 
would have vaguely speculated on his own 
existence; he wrote in The Descent of Man. 
But our propensity to believe in unseen 
deities has long puzzled Darwin's scientific 
descendants. Every human society has had 
its gods, whether worshipped from Gothic 
cathedrals or Mayan pyramids. In all cul-
tures, humans pour resources into elaborate 
religious buildings and rituals, with no obvi-
ous boost to survival and reproduction. So 
how and when did religion arise? 
No consensus yet exists among scientists, 
but potential answers arc emerging from 
both the archaeological record and studies of 
the mind itself. Some researchers, exploring 
religion's effects in society, suggest that it 
may boost fitness by promoting cooperative 
behavior. And in the past IS years, a growing 
number of researchers have followed 
Darwin's lead and explored the hypothesis 
that religion springs naturally from the nor-
mal workings of the human mind. This new 
field, the cognitive science of religion, draws 
on psychology, anthropology, and neuro-
science to understand the mental building 
blocks of religious thought. "There are func-
tional properties of our cognitive systems 
that lean toward a belief in supernatural 
agents, to something like a god," says experi-
mental psychologist Justin Barrett of the Uni-
versity of Oxford in the United Kingdom. 
Barrett and others see the roots of reli-
gion in our sophisticated social cognition. 
Humans, they say, have a tendency to see 
signs of "agents"—minds like our own—at 
work in the world. "We have a tremendous 
capacity to imbue even inanimate things 
with beliefs, desires, emotions, and con-
sciousness, ... and this is at the core of many 
religious beliefs," says Yale University psy-
chologist Paul Bloom. 
Meanwhile, archaeologists seeking signs 
of ancient religion focus on its inextricable 
link to another cognitive ability: symbolic 
behavior. They, too, stress religion's social 
component. "Religion is a particular form of 
a larger, social symbolic behavior," says 
archaeologist Colin Renfrew of the Univer-
sity of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. 
So archaeologists explore early religion by 
excavating sites that reveal the beginnings of 
symbolic behavior and of complex society. 
Yet these fields are developing chiefly in 
parallel, and there remains a yawning gap 
between the material evidence of the archaeo-
logical record and the theoretical models of 
psychologists. Archaeological objects fall 
short of revealing our ancestors' minds, says 
Bloom, while on the psychological side. "we 
need more evidence." 
Birth of the gods 
When did religious beliefs begin? 
A likely place to find out is the 
archaeological record, but infer-
ring "religion" from ancient 
objects and practices can be a tall 
order. Many researchers take the 
use of symbols as a clue to bud-
ding spirituality. As far back as 
100,000 years ago, people at the 
South African site of Blombos 
Cave incised pieces of ochre 
with geometric designs, creating 
the first widely recognized signs 
of symbolic behavior (Science, 
30 January, p. 569). Although it's 
difficult to equate enigmatic 
lines on a chunk of ochre with a 
belief system, researchers agree

that such use of symbols is a prerequisite for 
religion, and some argue that religious 
beliefs must have existed by this time. 
The first deliberate burials are found at 
roughly the same time, at a site called Qafzeh 
in Israel, dated to about 95,000 years ago. 
Researchers have dug up more than 30 indi-
viduals, including a 9-year-old child with its 
legs bent and a deer antler in its arms. And 
starting about 65,000 years ago or even ear-
lier, Neandertals also sometimes buried their 
dead. Henry de Lumley of the Institut de 
Paleontologic Humaine in Paris has referred 
to these ancient burials as 'the birth of meta-
physical anguish:' 
But others aren't sure what metaphysical 
message burial conveys. "There can be lots 
of reasons to bury things; just look at kids in 
a sandbox:* says Barrett. Burial by itself, 
says archaeologist Nicholas Conard of the 
University of Tubingen in Germany. may 
best be considered a sign of "protobelief." 
If they had to name one time and place 
when the gods were born. Conard and some 
others might point to 30,000 to 35,000 years 
ago in Europe. That's when symbolic expres-
sion flowered in what's called the Upper 
Paleolithic explosion (Science, 6 February, 
p. 709). At this time, Ice Age hunter-gatherers 
painted strikingly realistic animals—and a 
few half-animal, half-human figures—on 
the walls of France's Grotto Chauvet and 
other caves. They also left small but spectac-
ular figurines in caves in Germany, including 
a dramatic carved ivory "Venus" reported in 
May and three "lion-men"—each a carved 
male body with the head of a lion. 
The "Venus of Hohle Fels" illustrates the 
difficulties of interpreting such ancient 
objects: Conard who discovered it, considers 
the 6-centimeter figure of a head-
less woman with huge breasts and 
carefully carved genitalia to be a 
religious fertility object. while 
archaeologist Paul Metiers of the 
University of Cambridge has 
called it "palco-porn." 
Yet many observers agree 
that the lionmen, with their com-
bination of human and animal 
qualities—something seen in 
many early religions—are strong 
candidates for a supernatural 
being or spirit guide. Some go so 
far as to suggest that the small 
statues were part of shamanistic 
rituals, though Conard says we 
cannot know for sure. "Even if it 
wasn't shamanism." he says. "I'd 
bet the bank it was something I'd 
consider religious beliefs:*
