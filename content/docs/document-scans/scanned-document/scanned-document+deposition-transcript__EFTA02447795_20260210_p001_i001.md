It's=been a tough 18 months for Jawbone. A new president hired from Google =ast year, Sameer Samat, returned to 
Google after just six months. It =aid off 15% of its workforce. The =ompany told one of its business =artners it couldn't 
make an August payment =eadline. Jawbone breached covenants on its =300 million loan from BlackRock, Jawbone 
confirmed, prompting the =nvestor to push Jawbone to put itself on the market. That sale process =idn't lead to any 
bids. 
Yet after =11 that, CEO Hosain Rahman is upbeat about Jawbone's prospects. =n an interview with The Information on 
Wednesday, he declared that =9Ca lot of things" have changed at the wearable maker as he =orks to pivot the business 
towards medical devices. 
THE =AKEAWAY 
Despite =inancial challenges, Jawbone co-founder and helmsman Hosain Rahman =sn't giving up, vowing to vanquish his 
naysayers as he moves =he company into a new industry. 
"We think we have some of =he strongest and most definitive stuff in the market. People are =eally, really excited about 
what we're doing and what we'=e building but it is a shift from where we've been before,"=he said. A former employee 
at Jawbone said the company has considered =eveloping a blood glucose monitor similar to those used by =iabetics. 
Earlier this month the company told =mployees in an internal email that it was "considering a number =f options" that 
include "a reincarnation of the =usiness," possibly through a restructuring. It also said the =ompany had arranged "term 
sheets" from "some of =he largest financial institutions in the world," including one =or another $150 million in funding. 
Mr. Rahman =ould not identify the financiers. But he said they had been given =E2 access to a lot of information that 
you don't =ave." 
The latest money-raising is on top =f nearly half a billion dollars Jawbone has raised over the past year =nd a half, 
including both the BlackRock loan and a $165 million round =eportedly led by Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund in January. 
Mr. =ahman disputed the amount raised in the Kuwaiti-led round but did not =laborate. Mr. Rahman said Jawbone had 
invested in product development. =E2 We're excited about where we put (the money] and what =t has yielded," he 
said. 
If Mr. =ahman's upbeat outlook sounds familiar, that's because =e has found himself in this position before. In 
September of last =ear, Mr. =ahman told The Information <http://go.theinformation.com/51184d> that he had "the 
=efinitive portfolio" in sensors and wearable technology. "=f you think about Fitbit as sort of the Nokia to Blackberry 
transition =n phones, we think we have the technology base that's =quivalent to iOS and Android." At the time Mr. 
Rahman said the =ompany was also sitting on wireless speaker technology that is "t=e next step of where that whole 
category goes."
