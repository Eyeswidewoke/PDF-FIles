month. "The Rock" plays a fictitious NFL quarterback in the big-budget 
football flick, and Sedgwick is his hard-nosed agent. (The movie was 
supposed to shoot in Boston over the summer, but had to be postponed when 
"The Rock" ruptured his Achilles tendon preparing for the role.) Neuwirth, 
who is returning to Broadway in the musical "Chicago," dropped out because 
of scheduling conflicts, according to published reports. Previously 
announced cast members, including Madison Pettis , Roselyn Sanchez , Morris 
Chestnut , Gordon Clapp , and Boston funnyman Lenny Clarke , all are still 
expected to appear in the film, which is being directed by Andy Fickman . 
Judging from a Q&A in the new issue of Entertainment Weekly, it would appear 
"The Rock" can't wait to return to the area. Asked what he'd eaten to put on 
30 pounds, the onetime pro wrestler responds: "Large cheese pizza and 
doughnuts. The pizza needs to be from Avellino's near Boston." . . . In 
other movie news, Acton's own Steve Carell will provide the voice for the 
mayor of Whoville in the animated version of "Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who" 
starring Jim Carrey as Horton. 
Local author 
misses shortlist 
The shortlist for Britain's prestigious Man Booker Prize for Fiction has 
been announced, and Somerville's Claire Messud is not on it. Messud's novel 
"The Emperor's Children" was one of just 19 books to make the longlist. The 
six novels on the shortlist include: Kiran Desai 's "The Inheritance of 
Loss"; Kate Grenville 's "The Secret Lover"; M.J. Hyland 's "Carry Me Down"; 
Hisham Matar 's "In the Country of Men;" Edward St. Aubyn 's "Mother's 
Milk"; and Sarah Waters 's "The Night Watch." 
(3) Denis Leary is sure in demand. The star and executive producer of 
"Rescue Me" has just inked a deal with Fox to coproduce a comedy with Don 
Reo , one of the creators of ABC's "My Wife and Kids." The untitled project 
will be about a thieving 15-year-old boy who moves in with his grandfather, 
who's also a thief. Speaking of Leary, the Emerson grad returned to his alma 
mater with his band, the Popes, last night to celebrate the school's 30-year 
comedy tradition. ( Jay Leno , Henry Winkler , Steven Wright , Joely 
Fisher , Andrea Martin , and David Cross all spent time at Emerson.) 
(2) Kevin and Joyce Lucey of Belchertown caught up with writer-director 
Patricia Foulkrod at a screening of Foulkrod's documentary "The Ground 
Truth" at the Boston Film Festival. The Luceys, whose Marine reservist son 
Jeffrey committed suicide after serving in Iraq, are active in the 
organization Military Families Speak Out. 
(1) Boston Lyric Opera stars past and present will perform tonight as 
part of the company's 30th anniversary bash at the Wang. Singers Earle 
Patriarco , Morris Robinson , Michael Hayes , and Lisa Daltirus , and 
conductor Willie Anthony Waters paid a surprise visit to a BLO board meeting 
this week.
