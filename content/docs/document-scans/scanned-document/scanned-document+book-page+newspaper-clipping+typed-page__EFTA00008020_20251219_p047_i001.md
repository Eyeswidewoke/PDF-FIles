20 Part I: Discovering Massage for Greater Health and Happiness  
Doctors are people, too 
You may notice that on several occasions in this 
book, I allude to physicians as people who are 
notquite up to speed with reality when it comes 
to the very provable value of massage therapy. 
In fact, I've already said something to that effect 
in this chapter. 
So I just want to make something clear before 
you getthe wrong idea: I think doctors are great 
I respect and admire doctors and consider 
several to be friends. Sure, there are some jerk 
doctors just like there are jerk massage 
therapists, but all-in•all, physicians are some of 
the most responsible, educated, humane, 
helpful humans on the planet, doing all kinds of 
good work. 
When you hear me say anything less than com-
plimentary about physicians or allopathic 
medicine, it's not the people themselves I'm 
referringto so much as the system we've cre-
ated in which they work. Unfortunately, our 
present situation does not allow for doctors to 
spend the time with each individual patient that 
they'd probably like to. At the same time, many 
of them are realizing the value of massage and 
have even begun including it in their practices. 
In fact, a September 1998 survey of medical 
schools published in the Journal of the 
American Medical ASsociation (JAMA) 
revealed that 64 percent of medical schools 
offer courses in complementary medicine, 
including massage, which is the most popular 
alternative modalitytaught 
Miriam Wetzel, Ph.D., director of curriculum 
development at Harvard Medical School, says 
that therapeutic massage is pan of the school's 
training. "I would like tosee the medical com-
munity recognize that there is a difference 
between therapeutic massage and something 
that's just relaxing," she says. 
In France, where my co-author Michel Van 
Walden received his training, physicians look at 
massage in a wholly different light. "What we 
do is respected as part•of the medical model all 
across Europe," says Michel. "Physicians there 
have no qualms about referring particular cases 
to massage therapists. In fact, the word we use 
in France for massage therapist is kinesiother-
apeut, which really signifies a combination of 
massage therapist, physical therapist, and holis-
tic practitioner who utilizes a number of healing 
tools, such as aromatherapy and herbology. 
There are 25,000 of them in France, which is an 
area the size of Texas. Most of them havetheir 
own clinics, andthey are very highly regarded 
by physicians and patients alike." 
Some of us in the alternative health world have 
given doctors a bum wrap.for too long. I say let's 
move forward toward an integrative medicine 
that includes their expertise and ours together. 
This is alreadyhappening aswitnessed by the 
quickly growing number of health clinics and 
hospitals with practitioners from many disci-
plines: 
M.D.s, acupuncturists, massage 
therapists, nutritionists, herbalists, and others. 
Esthetic massage 
We all want to look as good as we can, and massage can help. Through a com-
bination of several of the benefits mentioned earlier in this chapter, massage 
softens your skin and gives you a healthy glow. It is also used to improve the
