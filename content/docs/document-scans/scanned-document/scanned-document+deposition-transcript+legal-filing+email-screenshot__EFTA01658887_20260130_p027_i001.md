The Wall Street Journal (11/13, McMillan, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports 
companies developing COVID-19 vaccines say they are being targeted by Russian and North 
Korean cyberattacks. The attacks represent an espionage risk, as well as a challenge to the 
integrity of the research - and could also delay clinical trials. University of Oxford professor of 
international law Dapo Akande said, "We need to kind of raise the profile and to raise the 
quality of the discussion around these issues as to what is off-limits." 
DHS Says Becton Medical Pump Has Cybersecurity Issues. 
Law360 (11/13, Subscription Publication, 8K) reports, "Becton Dickinson & Co.'s Alaris infusion 
pump has cybersecurity weaknesses that, if exploited, could force users, typically hospitals, to 
operate them manually," DHS announced Friday. It "scored a 6.5 out of 10 on the agency's 
vulnerability scale and could lead to the pump, which is used to provide fluids, blood and 
medications to hospital patients, losing wireless capability, the agency said." The medical tech 
producer "said that the issue is not related to another of the pump's problems, which led to a 
voluntary recall and corresponding securities lawsuits." 
ByteDance Granted 15-Day Extension To Divest TikTok. 
Reuters (11/13, Shepardson) reports the Administration "granted ByteDance a 15-day 
extension of a divestiture order that had directed the Chinese company to sell its TikTok short 
video-sharing app by Thursday." Reuters adds, "TikTok first disclosed the extension earlier in a 
court filing, saying it now has until Nov. 27 to reach an agreement. Under pressure from the 
U.S. government, ByteDance has been in talks for a deal with Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to 
shift TikTok's U.S. assets into a new entity." On Friday, the Treasury Department "said...the 
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) granted the 15-day extension 
to 'provide the parties and the committee additional time to resolve this case in a manner that 
complies with the Order:" 
The Wall Street Journal (11/13, McKinnon, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that 
the Commerce Department on Thursday acknowledged that it was unlikely to enforce the 
original deadline to the legal challenges in US courts brought by ByteDance. 
CNN Business (11/13, Fung, Pham, 21.56M) reports that after the Thursday deadline, 
"confusion reigned over what consequences might be in store for TikTok." However, on Friday 
"TikTok told a federal judge that the US government had granted the company's request for an 
extension." The executive order "did not say that TikTok would be banned if it missed the 
deadline; in fact, it outlines no consequences at all." Its "ambiguity highlights the extremely 
unusual approach the Trump administration has taken" with TikTok. A provisional deal with 
Oracle and Walmart "would see TikTok reorganized as a new, global company headquartered in 
the United States, with US investors accounting for a majority of the new company's 
ownership." Now, "TikTok will have another 15 days to get its deal done," and users "will still be 
able to access the app" in that time. 
Bloomberg (11/13, 4.73M) reports that "federal judges in Washington and Pennsylvania 
have blocked" a potential ban on the app "set to go into effect on Nov. 12." The Department of 
Commerce "said on Thursday that it would comply with those orders, even as the government 
appeals the decisions." DOJ oversaw the sale order, which was "part of a separate process." 
President Trump "has said nothing about TikTok since last week's election, focusing instead on 
his legal battles to upend the vote." In its filing last week, ByteDance "said it hadn't heard back 
from" CFIUS "after offering a compromise to resolve the government's national security 
concerns and avoid a forced sale." 
Reuters (11/13, Shepardson) reports, "The Trump administration contends TikTok poses 
national security concerns, saying the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China's 
government." The app, "which has over 100 million U.S. users, denies the allegations." 
Separate restrictions from the Department of Commerce "have been blocked by federal courts,
