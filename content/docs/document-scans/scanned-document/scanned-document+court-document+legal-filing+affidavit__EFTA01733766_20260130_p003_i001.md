Attorney's Office would not involve itself in the administration of Mr. Epstein's 
sentence by county and state officials. Holding Mr. Epstein in violation of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement for serving the remainder of his county incarceration in 
home confinement would clearly interfere with the County's administration of its 
customary step down process contrary to your agreement 
5. 
Home confinement in the Sheriff's alternative custody program is 
demonstrably not the same thing as community control, which is exclusively 
administered by a different aurthority, namely the Florida State Department of 
Corrections. In fact, the two are quite distinct Home confinement in the Sheriffs 
"In-House Arrest" program is an alternative form of county incarceration 
administered exclusively by the Sheriffs Office. It requires no court order and, in 
Palm Beach, is subject to the discretion of the Sheriff's Office. Home confinement 
requires the inmate's continued presence within the confines of the four walls of the 
home, [except when the inmate travels to and from a pre-approved work location]. 
The inmate's continued presence within the confines of the home [and exact 
location while traveling to and from the pre-approved work location] is 
continuously monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by Sheriffs deputies through 
the use of an ankle bracelet and a GPS monitoring system. If the inmate leaves the 
confines of the home [or departs from the designated route to and from the work 
location] without prior authorization, deputies are instantaneously alerted. They 
are authorized to immediately arrest the inmate on the spot and return the inmate 
to institutional detention without the need for any court proceedings. 
Community control on the other hand is a court ordered enhanced form of 
probation administered by the Florida Department of Corrections and monitored by 
a select group of case officers i.e. those with less than 25 cases. Community control 
is a much broader sentence than the strict in-house arrest administered by the 
Sheriffs Office. Community control is "an individualized program in which the 
freedom of the offender is restricted in the community" as well as the home. Unlike 
the Sheriffs Office's in-house arrest program, in which inmates are subject to 
constant GPS monitoring by Sheriffs deputies, an offender serving a "community 
control" sentence voluntarily reports to his case officer once a week (as opposed to 
once a month in the case of ordinary probation). Although violation of any of these 
conditions could result in the revocation of community control, the violation must 
first be discovered and reported by the case officer, and the offender must be 
located before he can be detained. Even then, revocation of community control is 
not automatic; the offender is entitled to a court hearing, and only a judge can 
impose sanctions. 
Similarly, the community control sentence that Mr. Epstein is to serve after 
completing his county sentence is clearly distinct from in-home confinement under 
the Sheriffs alternative custody program. Under the court ordered terms of Mr. 
Epstein's community control sentence, Mr. Epstein will be free from the constant 
scrutiny of 24 hour a day / 7 day a week GPS monitoring, and instead will be
