Market Disruption Events 
The Calculation Agent may, in its sole discretion, determine that an event 
has occurred that prevents us or our affiliates from properly hedging our 
obligations under the Notes or prevents the Calculation Agent from valuing 
the Reference Currency in the manner initially provided for herein. These 
events may include disruptions or suspensions of trading in the markets as a 
whole or general inconvertibility or non-transferability of the Reference 
Currency. If the Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, determines that 
any of these events has occurred or is occurring on the Final Valuation 
Date, the 
Calculation Agent may determine the Final Spot Rate in good faith and in a 
commercially reasonable manner on such date, or, in the discretion of the 
Calculation Agent, may determine to postpone the Final Valuation Date and 
Maturity Date for up to five scheduled trading days, each of which may 
adversely affect the return on your Notes. If the Final Valuation Date has 
been postponed for five consecutive scheduled trading days and a market 
disruption event continues on the fifth scheduled trading day, then that 
fifth scheduled trading day will nevertheless be the Final Valuation Date 
and the 
Calculation Agent will determine the Spot Rate of the Reference Currency 
using the formula for and method of determining such Spot Rate which applied 
just prior to the market disruption event (or in good faith and in a 
commercially reasonable manner) on such date. 
If the Maturity Date is not a business day, the amounts payable on the Notes 
will be paid on the next following business day and no interest will be 
paid in respect of such postponement. 
A "business day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is 
neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are 
authorized or required by law or regulation to close in the City of New York. 
Events of Default and Acceleration 
If the Notes have become immediately due and payable following an event of 
default (as defined in the accompanying prospectus) with respect to the 
Notes, the Calculation Agent will determine the accelerated Payment at 
Maturity due and payable in the same general manner as described in "Key 
Terms" 
in this pricing supplement. In that case, the business day preceding the 
date of acceleration will be used as the Final Valuation Date for purposes of 
determining the accelerated Reference Currency Return (including the Final 
Spot Rate). The accelerated Maturity Date will be the fifth business day 
following the accelerated Final Valuation Date. 
If the Notes have become immediately due and payable following an event of 
default, you will not be entitled to any additional payments with respect 
to the Notes. For more information, see "Description of Debt Securities —
Senior Debt Securities — Events of Default" in the accompanying prospectus. 
Supplemental Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest) 
Pursuant to the terms of a distribution agreement, HSBC Securities (USA) 
Inc., an affiliate of HSBC, will purchase the Notes from HSBC for 
distribution to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and certain of its registered 
broker-dealer affiliates, acting as placement agent, at the price indicated 
on the
