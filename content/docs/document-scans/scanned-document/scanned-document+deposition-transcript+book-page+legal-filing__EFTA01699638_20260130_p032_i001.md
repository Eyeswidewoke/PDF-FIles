824 F.Supp. 330 
(Cite as: 824 F.Supp. 330, `333) 
(5) Federal courts have consistently held that state 
statutes which preclude disclosure of records to the 
general public cannot be used to prevent federal 
grand juries from obtaining the records through a 
subpoena. 
The cases of In re Grand Jury'
Subpoena for New York State Income Tax Records, 
468 F.Supp. 575 (N.D.N.Y.), appeal dismissed. 
607 F.2d 566 (24 Cir.I979), and In re Grand Jury 
Subpoena for the Prod. of Certain New York State 
Sales 
Tax 
Records. 
382 
F.Supp. 
1205 
(W.D.N.Y.1974), are particularly relevant to the 
case at hand. Both cases involved federal grand 
jury subpoenas issued to officials of the New York 
State Department of Taxation for the production of 
certain tax records. The petitioners moved to quash 
the subpoenas on the grounds that compliance 
would be in violation of certain secrecy provisions 
of New York State tax laws. 
These laws are very 
similar to N.Y.Crim.Prociaw § 190.25, subd. 4, 
which the District Attorney relies on in his motion. 
The courts in these cases explicitly rejected the 
argument that compliance was unreasonable because 
it would force the state officials to violate state law 
secrecy provisions. 
The courts ruled that the 
Supremacy Clause must prevail over the stare 
nondisclosure provisions. 
As the court in In re 
Grand Jury Subpoena for New York Stare Income 
Tax Records stated: 
The Supreme Court has several times indicated 
that, by virtue of the supremacy clause, state 
legislation must yield whenever it comes into 
conflict with an Act of Congress or the superior 
authority of the Constitution. Thus, inasmuch as 
the federal 934 grand jury is a product of the 
Fifth Amendment and its powers, as a result of its 
long history and specific Congressional attention, 
the 
conflict 
between 
state 
confidentiality 
provisions and Congressional or constitutional 
investigatory powers has resulted in enforcement 
of federal grand jury subpoenas despite state 
statutes 
which 
would 
otherwise 
prohibit 
compliance. 
In re Grand Jury Subpoena for New York State 
Income Tax, 468 F.Supp. at 577 (citations omitted). 
Courts in other Circuits, relying on the Supremacy 
Clause, have similarly rejected claims from state 
officials that compliance with a federal subpoena 
would force them to violate state confidentiality 
laws. 
See, e.g., In re Special April 1977 Grand 
Jury, 581 F.2d 589, 593 n. 3 (7th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 439 U.S. 1046, 99 S.Ct. 721, 58 L.Ed.2d 
705 (1978); Carr v. Monroe Mfg. Co., 431 F.2d 
384, 388 (5th Cir.1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 
Page 14 
1000. 91 S.Ct. 456, 27 L.Ed.2d 451 (1971); In re 
1980 United States Grand Jury Subpoena Duces 
TCCILM, 502 F.Supp. 576, 579-80 (E.D.La.1980); 
United States v. Grand Jury Investigation, 
F.Supp. 389, 393 (E.D.Pa.1976). 
Thus, the case 
law clearly establishes that state law provisions 
relating to grand jury secrecy do not preclude a 
federal grand jury from obtaining state grand jury 
records pursuant to a subpoena. 
(6) The District Attorney further argues that the 
grand jury subpoena was not served upon the proper 
party. Specifically, the District Attorney contends 
that pursuant to the state grand jury secrecy law, 
N.Y.Crim.P.Law § 190.25, subd. 4, the state court 
has the ultimate and exclusive control over the 
subpoenaed grand jury material and, therefore, is 
the actual custodian of the grand jury records. 
Thus, the District Attorney argues that the grand 
jury subpoena should have been saved on the 
presiding state court judge rather than the District 
Attoriaey. The Court disagrees. 
• 
A custodian of records is the person or entity who 
is in actual possession of the documents at the time 
the subpoena is issued. In re Grand Jury Impaneled 
Jon. 21, 1975, 541 P.24 373, 377 (3d Cir.1976) 
(citations omitted). In order to testify competently 
as a records custodian, a witness must be able to 
verify the authenticity and completeness of the 
requested documents. 
In this case, the District Attorney does not dispute 
the fact that his office possesses the requested grand 
jury material, nor does he deny that the grand jury 
materials were generated as a result of an 
investigation 
conducted 
by 
his 
office. 
Accordingly, the District Attorney's office is the 
sole entity that can competently testify as to the 
authenticity and completeness of the requested 
material. The presiding state court judge does not 
possess the subpoenaed materials nor would he or 
she have any Imowledge concerning the authenticity 
or completeness of the grand jury records. 
Thus. 
the Court finds that the District Attorney's Office is 
the custodian of the state grand jury records and is 
therefore the proper party to be served with the 
subpoena. 
The District Attorney also contends that compliance 
with the federal grand jury subpoena would be 
unreasonable because it would violate policies of 
comity.
