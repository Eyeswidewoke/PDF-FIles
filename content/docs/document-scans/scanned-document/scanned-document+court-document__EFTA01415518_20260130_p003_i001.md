unknown, and no assurance can be made that the impact of such changes would 
not have a material adverse effect on the prospects of the Issuer or the 
value or marketability of the Notes. In particular, if existing 
transactions are not exempted from any such new rules or regulations, the 
costs of compliance with such rules and regulations could have a material 
adverse effect on the Issuer and the owners of Notes. 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Commodity Exchange Act to 
include "swaps" in the definition of "commodity interests" which, if traded 
by an entity may cause that entity to fall within the definition of a 
"commodity pool" under the Commodity Exchange Act and the Collateral Manager 
to fall within the definition of a "commodity pool operator". Based on 
recent CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to be treated 
as a commodity pool. In the event that such guidance changes or the Issuer 
engages in one or more activities that might cause it to be treated as a 
commodity pool or the Collateral Manager to be treated as a CPO or 
"commodity trading adviser" (CTA), regulation of the Collateral Manager (or 
another transaction party) as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Collateral 
Manager to be subject to extensive registration and reporting requirements 
that would involve material costs to the Issuer. The scope of such 
requirements and related compliance costs are uncertain but could adversely 
affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. In 
addition, the operators of pooled investment vehicles that own Notes could 
also be subject to the jurisdiction of the CFTC and be required to register 
with the CFTC as CPOs if the Issuer is a commodity pool. As a result of 
these developments, the Issuer will not be permitted to enter into any Hedge 
Agreement unless either (a) entering into the Hedge Agreement would not 
cause the Issuer to be considered a "commodity pool" under the Commodity 
Exchange Act, (b) if the Issuer would be considered a commodity pool, the 
Collateral Manager would be the CPO, the Collateral Manager would be 
eligible for an exemption from registration as a CPO and all requirements of 
that exemption would be satisfied or (c) if the Issuer would be considered a 
commodity pool, the Collateral Manager would be the CPO and the Collateral 
Manager, at all material times, would be a registered CPO as required under 
the Commodity Exchange Act. Accordingly, there may be circumstances where 
it would otherwise be in the Issuer's interest to enter into a Hedge 
Agreement to hedge or mitigate certain economic risks, but it will not be 
able to do so, which could reduce amounts available to make payments on the 
Notes. 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted changes to the 
accounting standards for structured products. These changes, or any future 
changes, may affect the accounting for entities such as the issuing entity, 
could under certain circumstances require an investor or its owner generally 
to consolidate the assets of the issuing entity in 
its financial statements and record third parties' investments in the trust 
fund as liabilities of that investor or owner or could otherwise adversely 
affect the manner in which the investor or its owner must report an 
investment in Notes for financial reporting purposes.
