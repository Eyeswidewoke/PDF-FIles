Hedge fund redemptions are generallyon a monthly, quarterlyor annual basis but can sometimes be subj 
ect to a multi-yearlockup before a redemption is permitted. For redemptions, there is generallya not 
ification period that can be a long interval before the actual 
redemption date. Redemption proceeds are generallypaid 3-5 business days afterthe final NAVis issued 
, but can be subject to a holdback of a portion of the proceeds until an annual audit of the Fund ha 
s been completed. Please referto the applicablehedge fund's 
operativedocumentation for furtherdetails. 
Forhedge funds, one of two methods will be used on this statement to report how incentive fees that 
may be owed to the GeneralPartneror Managerare paid. The first method is called "Series of Shares an 
d Consolidation Method" and will allocate a new series of the 
hedge fund at a parvalue (e.g. 1, 100 or 1000) for everysubscription period during the yearand a dif 
ferentNAVwill be trackedfor each series. At the end of the applicableincentive fee period (generally 
the end of the year),any series for which an incentive fee is payable 
(i.e., the fund has a net profit or is overthe applicable"high water mark"and known as the "Consolid 
sting Series")will be incorporatedwith and consolidated as part of the earliestseries issued by the 
fund in which an investorhas subscribed for which an incentive fee is 
payable(the "Lead Series"). Investorsholding shares in a Consolidating Series will have theirshares 
redeemedfrom each ofthe Consolidating Seriesand simultaneouslybe issued additionalshares ofthe LeadS 
eries(basedon the NAVofthe LeadSerieson the conversion 
date). Any series for which an incentive fee is not payable(i.e. the fund has a net loss or is not o 
verthe applicable"high water mark") will remain as a separateseries until the following incentive fe 
e period ends (generallyat year-end),when it will again be evaluated and 
consolidatedas part of the LeadSeries if the previouslydescribedcriteria is met. 
The second method is calledthe "EqualizationMethod". "Equalization"is an accounting methodologyused 
to ensure that each investorin a hedge fund is paying his/her equitableallocation of incentive fees. 
Unlike the Seriesof Shares method, shares held by all investors 
are valued at the same NAV. The "EqualizationAmount" reflects an amount deducted from the subscripti 
on amount in order to "equalize"the incentive fees among investors investing to the Fund in the curr 
ent year. The "EqualizationFactor" used to determine the 
EqualizationAmount may varyamong investors and depends on both the date at which an investorsubscrib 
es to the fund and the fund's current levelofperformance. An investorwho subscribes to a fund follow 
ing the initial closing date will havean Equalization Amount 
effectivelysegregatedfrom the subscription amount utilized to purchase shares. The EqualizationAmoun 
t can change overtime, depending on anynew investors entering the fund as the amount is again "equal 
ized"to ensure each investorhas an equitable allocation of 
incentive fees. Note that a change in equalizationovertime can result in a negativeEqualizationAmoun 
t. A negativeequalizationamount implies a potential reduction in investorshares to payincentive fees 
to the Manager. 
There are two EqualizationMethods commonly used today: "Redemption Method" or "DepreciationMethod". 
Underboth methods, if the fund is up in value from its inception date and from the date in which an 
investorhas invested at the end of the applicable period 
(generallyyear-end)the EqualizationAmount is used by the Fund to issue additional shares to the inve 
stor. If the investor had invested in the fund when the fund is down in value from its inception dat 
e and the fund subsequently goes up in value (at or beyond the 
applicablehigh water mark), under the Redemption Method an investor's shares will be redeemedto pay 
incentive fees owed to the manager. Underthe DepreciationMethod, an amount is deducted from the subs 
cription amount and credited as a depreciation deposit 
which is then used to payincentivefees owed to the GeneralPartneror Manageron an ongoing basis. Fora 
dditionalinformation, referto the hedge fund's operatingdocuments.
