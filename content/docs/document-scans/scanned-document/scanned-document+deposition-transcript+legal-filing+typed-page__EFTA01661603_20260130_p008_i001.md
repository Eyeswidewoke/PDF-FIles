Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa F... Page 8 of 32 
neighborhood of $20 million. Epstein then undertook his own $10 million gut renovation (special 
features: closed-circuit TV and a heated sidewalk in front of the house for melting snow), saying to 
friends: "I don't want to live in another person's house." 
There are other houses as well, including a sweeping villa in Palm Beach and a custom-built 51,000-
square-foot castle in Santa Fe. Said to be the largest house in the state, the latter sits atop a hill on a 
45,000-acre ranch. He had it built because of the month or so he found himself spending there, talking 
elementary particle physics with his friend Murray Gell-Man, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and co-
chair of the science board at the Santa Fe Institute. 
Epstein also owned a grand house (he has since sold it) near Wexner's opulent manse at the center of the 
Limited magnate's high-end housing development in New Albany, Ohio. New Albany was a lush sprawl 
of farmland on the outskirts of Columbus that Wexner, starting in 1988, turned into•a rich village of 
multimillion-dollar Georgian homes surrounding a Jack Nicklaus—designed golf course. It was a massive 
development project, financed largely by Wexner himself. Epstein was a general partner in the real-
estate holding company, called New Albany Property, despite putting only a few million dollars of 
capital into the project. 
"Before Epstein came along in 1988, the financial preparations and groundwork for the New Albany 
development were a total mess," says Bob Fitrakis, a Columbus-based investigative journalist who has 
written extensively on Wexner and his finances. "Epstein cleaned everything up, as well as serving 
Wexner in other capacities — such as facilitating visits to Wexner's home of the crew from Cats and 
• 
organizing a Tony Randall song-and-dance show put on in Columbus." Wexner declines to talk about 
his relationship with Epstein, but it is clearly one that continues to this day. Not that it helped Epstein in 
any way to land Clinton. Wexner is a staunch Republican donor, and Epstein, aside from a small 
contribution to the president's legal-defense fund, has given more to the likes of former senator Al 
D'Amato. 
What attracted Clinton to Epstein was quite simple: He had a plane (he has a couple, in fact — the 
Boeing 727, in which he took Clinton to Africa, and, for shorter jaunts, a black Gulfstream, a Cessna 
421, and a helicopter to ferry him from his island to St. Thomas). Clinton had organized a weeklong tour 
of South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Rwanda, and Mozambique to do what Clinton does. So when the 
president's advance man Doug Band pitched the idea to Epstein, he said sure. As an added bonus, Kevin 
Spacey, a close friend of Clinton's, and actor Chris Tucker came along for the ride. 
While Epstein got an intellectual kick out of engaging African finance ministers in theoretical chitchat 
about economic development, the real payoff for him was observing Clinton in his m€tier: talking 
HIV/aids policy with African leaders and soaking up the love from Cape Town to Lagos. 
Epstein brings a trophy-hunter's zeal to his collection of scientists and politicians. But the real charge for 
him is in seeing these guys work it. Like former Democratic Senate leader George Mitchell, for 
example. In Epstein's mind, Mitchell is the world's greatest negotiator, based on his work in Ireland and 
the Middle East. So he wrote the senator a bunch of checks. Says Mitchell: "He has supported some 
philanthropic projects of mine and organized a fund-raiser for me once. I would certainly call him a 
friend and a supporter." 
But it is his covey of scientists that inspires Epstein's true rapture. Epstein spends $20 million a year on 
them -- encouraging them to engage in whatever kind of cutting-edge research might attract their fancy. 
They are, of course, quite lavish in their praise in return. Gerald Edelman won the Nobel Prize for 
physiology and medicine in 1972 and now presides over the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla. "Jeff is
