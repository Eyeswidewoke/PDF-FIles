19. 
TAXATION 
Luxembourg 
19.1 
The Company's assets are subject to tax ((axe d'abonnemen() in Luxembourg of 0.01% p.a. on net assets, 
payable quarterly. In case some Compartments arc invested in other Luxembourg undertalcings for collective 
investment, which in turn are subject to the subscription tax provided for by the 2007 Act, the 2002 Act or the 
2010 Act no subscription tax is due from the Company on the portion of assets invested therein. 
19.2 
The Company's income is not taxable in Luxembourg. Income received from the Company may be subject to 
withholding taxes in the country of origin of the issuer of the security, in respect of which such income is paid. 
No duty or tax is payable in Luxembourg in connection with the issue of Shares of the Company. 
19.3 
Investors should consult their professional advisors on the possible tax or other consequences of buying, 
holding, redeeming, convening, transferring or selling any units under the laws of their countries of citizenship, 
residence or domicile. 
19.4 
Under current legislation, Shareholders are not subject to any capital gains, income, withholding, estate, 
inheritance or other taxes in Luxembourg, except for (i) those Shareholders domiciled, resident or having a 
permanent establishment in Luxembourg. or (ii) non-residents of Luxembourg who hold 10% or more of the 
issued share capital of the Company and who dispose of all or part of their holdings within six months from the 
date of acquisition or (iii) in some limited cases some former residents of Luxembourg, who hold 10% or more 
of the issued share capital of the Company. 
EU Savings Directive 
19.5 
On 3 June 2003, the EU Council of Economic and Finance Ministers adopted the Directive 2003/48/EC on 
taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (the EU Savings Directive). The EU Savings 
Directive is applied by Member States as from 1 July 2005 and has been implemented in Luxembourg by the act 
of 21 June 2005. 
19.6 
The Company is currently considered by the Luxembourg tax authorities as out of scope the EU Savings 
Directive. However, as the operation of the EU Savings Directive will be reviewed after three years, it cannot 
therefore be excluded that the scope of the EU Savings Directive and/or other articles of the EU Savings 
Directive would be amended at that point in time. Possible (future) EU Savings Directive implications should 
thus be monitored on a continuing basis. 
Other jurisdictions 
19.7 
Interest, dividend and other income realised by the Company on the sale of securities of non-Luxembourg 
issuers, may be subject to withholding and other taxes levied by the jurisdictions in which the income is sourced. 
It is impossible to predict the rate of foreign tax the Company will pay since the amount of the assets to be 
invested in various countries and the ability of the Company to reduce such taxes is not known. 
19.8 
The information set out above is a summary of those tax issues which could arise in Luxembourg and does not 
purport to be a comprehensive analysis of the tax issues which could affect a prospective subscriber. It is 
expected that Investors may be resident for tax purposes in many different countries. Consequently, no attempt is 
made in this Memorandum to summarise the tax consequences for each prospective Investor of subscribing, 
converting, holding, redeeming or otherwise acquiring or disposing of Shares in the Company. These 
consequences will vary in accordance with the law and practice currently in force in an Investor's country of 
citizenship, residence, domicile or incorporation and with his or her personal circumstances.
