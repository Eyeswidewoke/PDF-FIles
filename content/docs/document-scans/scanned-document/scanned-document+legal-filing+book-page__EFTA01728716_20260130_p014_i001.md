investigations. Just as law-enforcement officers need to be concerned that their 
investigation• might further traumatize a child victim, therapists and physi-
cians need to be concerned that their treatment techniques might hinder the 
investigation. 
The Law-Enforcement Perspective 
The law-enforcement perspective deals with criminal activity and legally 
defensible fact-finding. The process must, therefore, focus more on 
■ admissible evidence of what happened than on emotional belief that some-
thing happened 
■ the accuracy than on the existence of repressed memory 
■ objective than on subjective reality 
■ neutral investigation than on child advocacy 
In their desire to convince society that child sexual victimization exists and 
children do not lie about it, some professionals interpret efforts to seek corrobora-
tion for alleged sexual victimization as a sign of denial or disbelief. Corroboration, 
however, is essential. Investigators cannot just accept that something sexual hap-
pened to a child and ignore the context details that are necessary if it is to be 
proven in a court of law. When the only evidence offered is the word of a child 
against the word of an adult, child sexual victimization can be difficult to prove in 
a court of law. It is not the job of law-enforcement officers to believe a child or any 
other victim or witness. The child victim should be carefully interviewed. The 
information obtained should be assessed and evaluated, and appropriate 
investigation should be conducted to corroborate any and all aspects of a victim's 
statement. The investigator should always be an objective fact-finder considering 
all possibilities and attempting to determine what happened with an open mind. 
As previously stated, in a valid case, the best and easiest way to avoid child-victim 
testimony in court is to build a case so strong that the offender pleads guilty. Most 
children, however, can testify in court if necessary. 
Emotion Versus Reason 
Regardless of intelligence and-education, and often despite common sense 
and evidence to the contrary, adults tend to believe what 
they want or need to believe. The greater the need, the 
greater the tendency. The extremely sensitive and emotional 
nature of child sexual exploitation makes this phenomenon 
a potential problem in these cases. For some no amount of 
training and education can overcome this zealotry. Some 
people seem to be incapable of becoming objective fact-
finders in some sexual-victimization-of-children cases. 
Investigators must evaluate this tendency in other inter-
veners and minimize it in themselves by trying to do their 
job in a rational, professional manner. 
In order to be effective interviewers, investigators must be both aware of 
and in control of their own feelings and beliefs about victims and offenders in 
child-sexual-exploitation cases. People in the United States tend to have ste-
reotypical concepts of the innocence of children and malevolence of those who 
sexually victimize them. Most investigators now know that a child molester can 
look like anyone else and may even be someone we know and like. As 
previously discussed the stereotype of the child victim as a completely innocent 
Regardless of intelligence 
and education, and often 
despite common sense and 
evidence to the contrary, 
adults tend to believe what 
they want or need to believe. 
The greater the need, the 
greater the tendency.
