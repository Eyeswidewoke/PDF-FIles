Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa F... Page 5 of 32 
public. Epstein breaks the mold. Most everyone on the Street has heard of him, but nobody seems to 
know what the hell he is up to. Which is just the way he likes it. 
"My belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't get a straight 
answer from him," says one well-known investor. "He once told me he had 300 people working for him, 
and I've also heard that he manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the 
Wizard of Oz — there may be less there than meets the eye." 
Says another prominent Wall Streeter: "He is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque figure. He likes people to 
think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of aloofness. The whole thing is weird." 
The wizard that meets the•eye is spare and fit; with a long jaw and a carefully coiffed head of silver hair, 
he looks like a taller, younger Ralph Lauren. A raspy Brooklyn accent betrays his Coney Island origins. 
He spends an hour and fifteen minutes every day doing advanced yoga with his personal instructor, who 
travels with him wherever he goes. He is an enthusiastic member of the Trilateral Commission and the 
Council on Foreign Relations. 
He dresses casually -- jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers -- and is rarely seen in a tie. Indeed, those 
close to him say the reason he quit his board seat at the Rockefeller Institute was that he hated wearing a 
suit. "It feels like a dress," he told one friend. 
Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose 
nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. "I've 
known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy," Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be 
with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger 
side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life." 
But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about Epstein: As some collect 
butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. "I invest in people -- be it politics or science. Ifs what I do," he 
has said to friends. And his latest prize addition is the former president. In his eyes, Clinton as a species 
represents the highest evolutionary form of the political animal. To be up close to him, as he was during 
the African journey, is akin to seeing the rarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his 
return from Africa, "If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike Tyson 
walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign leaders had when Clinton entered the 
room. He is the world's greatest politician." 
"Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global 
markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science," Clinton says through a spokesman. 
"I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on 
democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS." 
Before Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to be speculation as to the true 
nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell. While they are still friends, the English tabloids have• 
postulated that Maxwell has longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons 
Epstein has not reciprocated in kind. "Ifs a mysterious relationship that they have," says society 
journalist David Patrick Columbia, "In one way, they are soul mates, yet they are hardly companions 
anymore. ifs a nice conventional relationship, where they serve each other's purposes." 
Friends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-octane than Epstein's, lent 
a little pizzazz to the lower-profile Epstein. Indeed, at a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is
