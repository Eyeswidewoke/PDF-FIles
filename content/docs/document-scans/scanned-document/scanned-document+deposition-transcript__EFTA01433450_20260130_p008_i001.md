plaintiffs' agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts 
require that this matter be litigated in New York. (Mem. Of Law in Support 
of Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 22-32.) 
Transfer to a new forum under the federal venue statute requires that the 
transfer be "[f]or the convenience of the parties and witnesses [and] in the 
interest of justice." 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). Citibank and Citigroup bear the 
burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that transfer is 
necessary. In re Charles Schwab & Co. Sec. Litig., 69 F.Supp.2d 734, 735 
(D.Vi.1999) (citing Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 25 (3d Cir. 
1970)). Although a trial judge is afforded great discretion in deciding this 
motion, he or she should not disturb a plaintiffs choice of forum unless the 
balance of factors strongly weighs in favor of transfer. Jackson v. 
Executive Airlines, Inc., Civ. No.2000-121, 2001 WL 664673, *2, 2001 U.S. 
Dist. 8004 LEXIS at *7 (D.V.I. June 7, 2001). A defendant seeking a transfer 
will not overcome this presumption unless the defendant can prove that the 
"balance of convenience of the parties is strongly in favor of defendant." 
Shutte., 431 F.2d at 25. Among the factors to be considered in making this 
determination are: 
(1) plaintiffs choice of forum; (2) defendant's preference; (3) where the 
claim arose; (4) convenience to the parties; (5) convenience to witnesses--
but only to the extent that the witnesses may actually be unavailable for 
trial in one of the fora; (6) location of books and records; (7) practical 
considerations that could make the trial easier, more expeditious, or less 
expensive; (8) congestion of the possible fora; and (9) the familiarity of 
the trial judge with the applicable state law in diversity cases. 
See generally Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 873, 879-80 (3d Cir.-
1995). 
Considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding this case, I make 
the following findings. First, Epstein and Financial Trust have selected 
this forum, and they are residents of the Virgin Islands with strong ties to 
this community. Epstein owns a seventy-acre island, and he and Financial 
Trust employ some twenty people. (Pls.' Mem. Of Law in Opp'n to Mot. To 
Dismiss, Epstein Decl. ¶¶ 2, 4-5.) It is important that local plaintiffs 
with grievances against defendants subject to this Court's jurisdiction be 
permitted to seek redress here in the Virgin Islands. As already noted, no 
forum selection clause binds the parties to bring suit in any particular 
jurisdiction. The defendants contacted the plaintiffs and entered into 
negotiations concerning the AIG investment while they were in the Virgin 
Islands, and at least one agreement was addressed to the plaintiffs through 
transmission to the plaintiffs' attorneys in New York, intending that it be 
sent to the Virgin Islands. I do not find that the defendants will suffer 
any great inconvenience by litigating this matter here. As the plaintiffs 
point out, most of the documents needed to try the case have already been 
filed in this Court, and the defendants are currently litigating other cases 
in this Court. Moreover, the defendants have not stated that their key 
witnesses are unable to travel to the Virgin Islands. See Jumara, 55 F.3d at 
879. Finally, it is not at all clear that New York law must be applied to
