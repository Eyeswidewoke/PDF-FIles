substrate, such as regional volume or surface area size 
(Blackmon et al., 2010; Draganski et al., 2004; Fleming et al., 
2010; Maguire et al., 2000; Schneider et al., 2002). 
Early efforts to identify morphological hemispheric asym-
metries were to a large degree motivated by the desire to 
identify the biological bases of the asymmetric cortical 
language representation. A number of morphological asym-
metries have been described, notably involving plenum tem. 
porcde and pars opercularis, and their relationship to left 
hemispheric dominance for language asserted, but some of 
the particularly influential findings were reported several 
decades ago using what methodologies were available then 
(Geschwind and Levitsky, 1968; Galaburda et al., 1978; LeMay 
and Culebras, 1972). Subsequent research confirmed these 
structural asymmetries (Foundas et al., 1994, 1995; Anderson 
et al., 1999; Watkins et al., 2001) but demonstrated that the 
relationship between structural asymmetries in the plenum 
tempora/e and language lateral ization is not nearly as strong or 
as direct as asserted earlier, and the very existence of such 
a relationship has been scrutinized (Beaton, 1997). Other 
structural asymmetries have also been described and subse-
quently confirmed, notably eYakovlevian torque" (Yakovlev, 
1972; Yakovlev and Rakic, 1966; Watkins et al., 2001; Nan 
et al., 2007) characterized by the right frontal and left occip-
ital protrusions, whose possible relationship to any functional 
asymmetries remains unclear. Regional hemispheric asym-
metries both in cortical thickness (Luders et al., 2006) and 
volume (Good et al., 2001), both in gray and white matter 
(Penhune et al., 1996; Takao et al., 2011) have been reported. 
Any morphometric comparison of the two hemispheres 
may be complicated by individual variability, which is 
particularly pronounced in certain structures, e.g., anterior 
cingulate and paracingulate cortex (Fornito et al.. 2004; Huster 
et al., 2007). Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of 
sex-linked 
differences in regional brain morphology 
(Witelson, 1989; Habib et al., 1991; Crespo-Facorro et al., 2001), 
including hemispheric asymmetries (Luders et al., 2009; Raz 
et al., 2004), as well as age-related hemispheric differences 
(Raz et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2009). 
Our understanding of the functional differences between 
the two hemispheres has also been refined beyond the classic 
distinction between verbal and visuo-spatial asymmetries. 
Additional functional differences have been described, notably 
those linking the right hemisphere to cognitive novelty and 
exploratory behavior and the left hemisphere to cognitive 
familiarity and routinization. Since this functional asymmetry 
was first proposed (Goldberg and Costa. 1981; Goldberg et al., 
1994a), it has found support with various neuroimaging tech-
niques, including PET (Gold et al., 1996; Shadmehr and 
Holcomb, 1997), fMRI (Henson et al., 2000), and high-
frequency EEG (Kamiya et al., 2002). It has been argued that 
the "novelty-routinization" functional hemispheric asymme-
try is fundamental and irreducible to the more commonly 
invoked language-visuospatial asymmetry, since it is present 
in a wide range of mammalian species (Vallortigara, 2000; 
Vallortigara and Rogers, 2005; Vallortigara et al., 1999). 
To account for these functional differences, it has been 
proposed that systematic differences between the two hemi-
spheres exist in relative cortical space allocation to hetero-
modal association cortices versus modality-specific cortices 
(Goldberg and Costa, 1981). If this were to be the case, the 
functional implications of such cortical space allocation 
differences could be intriguing and would merit further 
examination. However, this assertion was based on old find-
ings and was limited to cortical convexity; therefore its val-
idity must be re-examined with up-to-date methods which 
would target both lateral and mesial aspects of the hemi-
spheres. Here, we report hemispheric differences in regional 
human brain volume across multiple cortical regions, both 
lateral and mesial, using the more recently developed Free-
Surfer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR!) processing meth-
odology (Fischl and Dale, 2000; Fischl et al., 2004). The 
particular focus of this paper is to ascertain any systematic 
differences in cortical space allocation to heteromodal versus 
modality-specific cortices in the two hemispheres.

Methods 
2.1. 
Participants 
Structural MRI data from adults (N = 39) aged 19-40 
— 27.75, standard deviation — SD, 
— 6.12; 19 females 
and 20 males) were analyzed. Participants were all right-
handed as determined by the Edinburgh Handedness Inven-
tory (Oldfield, 1971) with scores ranging from 40 to 100. They 
were all free of neurological, psychiatric, or neuro-
developmental disorders based on screening interviews. They 
were recruited as part of a community-based normative 
reference sample at NYU Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. 
2.2. 
Imaging data acquisition 
Two T1-weighted volumes (TE = 3.25 msec, TR = 2530 msec, 
TI = 1.100 msec, flip angle = 7', field of view (FOV) = 256 mm, 
voxel size — 1 x 1 1.33 mm) were obtained for each partici-
pant on a 3T Siemens Allegra scanner, acquisition parameters 
optimized for increased gray/white matter contrast, rigid body 
co-registered, and common space-reoriented. Images were 
automatically corrected for spatial distortion, registered, 
averaged to improve signal-to-noise ratio, and processed with 
the FreeSurfer (4.0.2) software (http://surfer.mnr.mgh. 
harvard edu). Each TI-weighted image took 8:07 min. 
2.3. 
Imaging data processing 
Averaged volumetric MRI images were used to model each 
subject's cortical surface with an automated procedure 
involving white-matter segmentation, gray/white matter 
boundary tessellation, inflation of folded surface tessellation, 
and automatic topological defect correction (Dale et al., 1999; 
Fisch] et al., 2001). 
Automated analysis was performed on a 156 node 
computing cluster and took approximately 32 h per scan. Each 
analysis was then manually inspected which took, depending 
on segmentation quality, 20-40 min. Measures of cortical 
thickness were obtained by constructing estimates of the gray/ 
white matter boundary by classifying all white matter voxels in 
the MRI volume. The white matter surface was submillimeter 
accuracy-refined in delineating the gray/white matter
