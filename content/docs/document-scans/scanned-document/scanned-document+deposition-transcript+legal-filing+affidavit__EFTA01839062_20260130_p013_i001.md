detectives. 
The account she provided was of a brutal and sustained sexual attack. She described how her 
attacker locked the suite door, dragged her into the bedroom, and then dragged her down the inner 
corridor to a spot close to the bathroom door—a distance of about forty feet—and, after 
attempting to assault her both anally and vaginally, he also forced her twice to perform fellatio. 
After that, she said fled the suite and hid in the far end of hallway until he left. She later 
identified DSK in the lineup as her attacker. 
Based on her description, the police Crime Scene unit sealed off two crime scenes: the 
presidential suite and the far end of hallway, and located 5 areas of the carpet in the interior 
hallway leading to the bathroom of the presidential suite that potentially had stains of semen or 
saliva. The next day, May 15th, its detectives brought sections of the carpet from the hallway as 
well as the wall paper to the police forensic biology lab. A preliminary examination showed that 
one of the five stains in the carpet, located about 6 feet from where Diallo had said she was 
assaulted, contained a mixture of semen and amylase (an enzyme from saliva) that was consistent 
with the DNA of DSK and Diallo. This was direct evidence that they had engaged in fellatio, as 
Diallo had claimed. (Three of the other stains also tested positive for semen, as did the wall 
paper, and a fourth stain showed a mixture of semen and saliva, but these stains were determined 
to be from six other individuals, and their sexual activity was assumed to be unrelated to the 
incident under investigation.) 
The next issue was whether forced was used. To this end, DSK was examined at St. Luke's 
hospital for any telltale bruises, traces of her DNA under his fingernails, or other any evidence of 
a struggle. None was found. Then On Sunday May 15th, DSK was formally arrested. 
The Manhattan district attorney office, under DA Cyrus Vance Jr., was possibly the best 
staffed prosecution teams in the United States. Its trial division alone had over 50 Assistant 
District Attorneys as well as dozens of investigative analysts and paralegals. Its Sex Crimes Unit, 
which had been assigned the case, had been the subject of a laudatory HBO documentary, So 
immediately after DSK's arrest, Lisa Friel, who had headed the Sex Crime Unit began examining 
the case, as did John "Artie" McConnell, the prosecutor assigned to the case, Ann Prunty, his 
"second" chair, and Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, the assistant DA who headed the newly-created Hate 
Crimes unit. The first issue facing this formidable team of prosecutors was bail. 
Bail is not unusual in the case of first time offenders with no previous criminal background, and 
employment. DSK was the managing director of the IMF. His lawyers, William W. Taylor III 
and Benjamin Brafman immediately moved to arrange bail. According to DSK's lawyers' 
understanding of their conversation with the prosecutors„ a deal was arranged at 4 PM on May 
15th whereby the prosecution would recommend $250,000 cash bail and DSK would relinquish 
his passport. But at 8 PM that Sunday, Lisa Friel, told Brafman on the phone "that things had 
changed and that there was no more agreement." Instead, the DA would recommend that bail not 
be granted. (Friel herself left the case shortly afterwards, and resigned from the district attorney's 
office.) 
What had reportedly happened in the four hour interim was that Vance had received 
information bearing on the case from Paris. Although it had been initially reported that this phone 
call concerned a French women, Tristane Banon, who had charged that DSK had attacked her, 
that accusation had not even been officially filed on May IV` (and was subsequently dismissed.) 
Instead, an investigation in the French newspaper Liberation by Fabrice Rousselot found that the 
call came from the phone of a senior official in the French government. The official, according to
