State Securities Authority Notice Filings and State Reporting by Exempt Reporting Advisers 
C. 
Under state laws, SEC-registered advisers may be required to provide to state securities authorities a copy of the Form ADV and any amendments they 
file with the SEC. These are called notice filings. In addition, exempt reporting advisers may be required to provide state securities authorities with a copy 
of reports and any amendments they file with the SEC. If this is an initial application or report, check the box(es) next to the state(s) that you would like 
to receive notice of this and all subsequent filings or reports you submit to the SEC. If this is an amendment to direct your notice filings or reports to 
additional state(s), check the box(es) next to the state(s) that you would like to receive notice of this and all subsequent filings or reports you submit to 
the SEC. If this is an amendment to your registration to stop your notice filings or reports from going to state(s) that currently receive them, uncheck the 
box(es) next to those state(s).
