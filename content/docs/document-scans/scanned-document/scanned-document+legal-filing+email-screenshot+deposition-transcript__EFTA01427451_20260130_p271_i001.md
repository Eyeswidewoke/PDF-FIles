Price Stabilization and Short Positions 
In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in stabilizing 
transactions, which involves making bids for, purchasing and 
selling shares of common stock in the open market for the purpose of 
preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock 
while this offering is in progress. These stabilizing transactions may 
include making short sales of the common stock, which involves the sale by 
the underwriters of a greater number of shares of common stock than they are 
required to purchase in this offering, and purchasing shares of 
common stock on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. 
Short sales may be "covered" shorts, which are short positions in an 
amount not greater than the underwriters' over-allotment option referred to 
above, or may be "naked" shorts, which are short positions in excess of 
that amount. The underwriters may close out any covered short position 
either by exercising their over-allotment option, in whole or in part, or by 
purchasing shares in the open market. In making this determination, the 
underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares 
available for purchase in the open market compared to the price at which the 
underwriters may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. 
A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are 
concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the 
common stock in the open market that may adversely affect investors who 
purchase in this offering. To the extent that the underwriters create a 
naked short position, they will purchase shares in the open market to cover 
the position. 
The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M of the 
Securities Act, they may also engage in other activities that 
stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the common stock, 
including the imposition of penalty bids. This means that if the 
representatives of the underwriters purchase common stock in the open market 
in stabilizing transactions or to cover short sales, the representatives
