the G-20 meetings) in order to have a meeting with Rousseff, Planning 
Minister Nelson Barbosa, and Chief of Staff Aloizio Mercadante. 
We expect Rousseff to repeat that Levy has her total support, and also to 
send to Congress an addendum to the 2016 federal budget reducing the 
projected deficit. Nevertheless, the reality is that Levy has lost a 
sequence of important fights in the government (especially the watering down 
of the fiscal measures, the change in the fiscal targets, and more recently 
the 2016 budget forecasting a federal primary deficit of 0.5% of GDP), and 
his position is becoming increasingly difficult day by day, as he remains 
under intense friendly fire (especially from the President's own party, the 
PT) and Rousseff seems to be having second thoughts about his fiscal 
austerity plan. As a matter of fact, we believe Levy has not left yet 
because the government fears that his departure could speed up Brazil's 
downgrade below investment grade, and because Levy himself knows that his 
departure would aggravate the crisis. 
The impression that we have at this point is that the federal government has 
indeed abandoned Levy's fiscal adjustment plan. According to newspaper Valor 
Econ6mico, the government is no longer willing to cut fiscal spending, 
believing that it is necessary to use expansionary fiscal policy (including 
subsidized loans) to rekindle growth. The authorities believe that, as 
economic growth picks up, tax revenues will improve, alleviating the fiscal 
situation. It seems that the farthest the government is willing to go to cut 
the primary fiscal deficit is to raise taxes, "especially on those sectors 
that gained the most during the Lula years," preserving its welfare 
programs. According to newspaper Estado de Sgo Paulo, Rousseff has not given 
up on the CPMF tax idea, and allegedly wants to convince Congress to propose 
reinstating the tax on financial transactions. According to the same source, 
some congressmen of the ruling coalition are warming up to the idea, in 
light of the aggravation of the economic crisis. However, resistance against 
the tax remains quite strong in the private sector and opposition, so it 
remains to be seen whether Rousseff will manage to muster enough political 
support to pass it in Congress. 
When the Rousseff administration announced Levy's appointment and its fiscal 
adjustment plans at the end of last year, we warned that the president began 
her first mandate in 2011 by tightening fiscal and monetary policies as 
well, but eventually gave up on those as growth faltered, promoting a 
combination of rapid fiscal and monetary easing that was dubbed the "new 
macroeconomic matrix." Thus, we warned that there was a significant risk 
that history could be repeated in Rousseff's second term. It seems, however, 
that the austerity-based strategy is unraveling much faster than we could 
have expected, probably because of the convoluted political environment and 
repercussions of the Petrobras bribery scandal (the "Car Wash" 
investigation). Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe that the 
economy will recover if the government returns to the same populist policies 
that were mainly responsible for the crisis in the first place. In the 
absence of a comprehensive fiscal adjustment and without a significant 
economic recovery, the risk is that Brazil might have to generate increasing 
inflation rates to cope with its ballooning public debt, a perverse process
