Mciliocts), we ran our decoding method with the same central and 
posterior sensors after removing ocular, muscular, and cardiac 
artifacts with a method based on independent component analysis 
(ICA) (Ring and Cunt re p as-Vida I. 2005). Although there was a notable 
drop in decoding accuracy (or y velocity in pre- and post-exposure. 
there was no statistically significant difference in the resultant mean 
CCs of the subjects for any phase of the task (two-tailed, paired t-test: 
p >0.05) ( I.ihle Si ). 
Potential application to neuromotor prosthetic control 
Most studies involving non-invasive BCI systems have focused on 
1) the classification of mental tasks to form a low bandwidth 
communication channel (rfuri‘cheller et al.. :t0061 Mellinger et al_ 
2007) or 2) continuous control of a cursor by subjects who, through 
relatively lengthy biofeedback training, learn to modulate the power 
of one or more frequency bands of neural signals to control one or 
more dimensions of cursor movement (Wolpaw and Nit loilantl, 
2004: Mcfai land er al . 2008). The lack of focus on decoding 
detailed kinematics of natural hand movements could be partly due 
to the unfounded presumption that this information cannot be 
decoded from non-invasive signals recorded from the scalp 
(I theclev awl Nit ()tells. 2001;). Despite this presumption, there 
exist several important exceptions to the lack of non-invasive 
studies aimed at developing decoding methods for controlling 
neuromotor prostheses. One study has decoded continuous joystick 
coordinates from MEG signals acquired during continuous pentagon 
drawing in the absence of visual feedback of movement (cum 
ponlos et al., 2011')). and another study has decoded information 
regarding hand tangential velocity from MEG signals acquired 
during trackball movements in two dimensions (lei In et al.. 2007). 
Our study primarily differs from the two aforementioned studies in 
that we decode continuous hand velocity from multi-joint move-
ments during a center-out drawing task that requires adaptation to a 
novel screen-cursor rotation. The center-out nature of our task is 
meaningful because it allows comparison to invasive decoding 
studies for neuromotor prostheses and emphasizes a desired 
function of the first generation of these devices. In terms of the 
visuomotor adaptation component. further investigation may pro-
vide insight into how the brain adapts to a tool such as a 
neuromotor prosthesis (I atedev el al.. :'005), and, hence, poten-
tially advance the understanding of how to achieve efficient co-
adaptation of the brain and decoding model. On a final comparative 
note, we ran each iteration of our decoding model with a relatively 
small set of training data composed of 16 (post-exposure) to 32 
(pre-. early-, and late-exposure) trials. This small amount of training 
data is meaningful because it may translate to a substantial 
reduction in the time required for a patient to gain mastery over 
the control of a neuromotor prosthesis. 
What remains to be elucidated is whether the decoding method 
presented in this report will also be applicable to EEG. which is 
better suited than MEG for an ambulatory prosthetic system. In 
terms of EEG-based decoding of movement parameters, several 
recent studies have decoded the direction of hand movement 
( I iantinon et al., 2008. Waldo. I et al.. 200S), but, to our knowledge. 
researchers have yet to report successful decoding of continuous 
hand position or velocity from EEG (a comprehensive search in 
peer-reviewed journals did not produce any studies). In the future. 
we will apply our decoding method to EEG signals to examine the 
application of this non-invasive modality to continuous, complex 
control of a neuromotor prosthesis.
