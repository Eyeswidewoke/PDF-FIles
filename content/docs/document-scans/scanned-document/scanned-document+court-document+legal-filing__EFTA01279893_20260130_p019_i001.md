is unreasonable, the application shall be deemed approved. Any relocation of boundaries shall not 
affect the interests in the Common Elements allocated to each Unit. Upon approval of the 
proposed relocation of boundaries, the Association shall cause to be prepared and filed, at the 
Adjoining Owners' expense, an amendment to this Declaration and a plat which identifies the 
Units involved, describes and depicts the altered boundaries, and gives the dimensions of the 
altered Units. Such amendment shall also contain operative words of conveyance and be signed by 
the Adjoining Owners and consented to by their Mortgagees, if any, and shall be indexed by the 
Register of Deeds in the names of the Adjoining Owners. 
(b) 
Subdivision of Units. Except for subdivision of Units by Declarant in accordance 
with Section 6.1(f) above, no Unit may be subdivided. 
(c) 
Partitioning. The interests in the Common Elements allocated to each Unit shall 
not be conveyed, devised, encumbered, partitioned or otherwise dealt with separately from said 
Unit, and the interests in the Common Elements allocated to each Unit shall be deemed conveyed, 
devised, encumbered or otherwise included with the Unit even though such interests arc not 
expressly mentioned or described in the instrument conveying, devising, encumbering or 
otherwise dealing with such Unit. Any conveyance, mortgage or other instrument which purports 
to grant any right, interest or lien in, to or upon the Unit, shall be null, void and of no effect 
insofar as the same purports to affect any interest in a Unit's allocated interests in the Common 
Elements unless the same purports to convey, devise, encumber or otherwise deal with the entire 
Unit. Any instrument conveying, devising, encumbering or otherwise dealing with any Unit, which 
describes said Unit by the identifying number assigned thereto on the Plans and herein without 
limitation or exception shall be deemed and construed to affect the entire Unit and its allocated 
interest in the Common Elements. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting or 
preventing ownership of any Unit and its allocated interest in the Common Elements by more than 
one person or entity as tenants in common, joint tenants, or as tenants by the entirety or any other 
form permitted by law. 
Section 9.6 
Conveyance or Encumbrance of Common Elements. While the Property 
remains subject to this Declaration and to the provisions of the North Carolina Condominium Act, 
no conveyances of or security interests or liens of any nature shall arise or be created against the 
Common Elements without the prior written consent of at least eighty percent (80%) of all 
Owners, including at least eighty percent (80%) of all Owners other than Declarant, and at least 
eighty percent (80%) of all Mortgagees. Every agreement for the performance of labor or the 
furnishing of materials to the Common Elements, whether oral or in writing, must provide that it 
is subject to the provisions of this Declaration and that the right to file a mechanic's lien or other 
similar lien by reason of labor performed or material furnished is subordinated to this Declaration 
and to the lien of assessments for Common Expenses provided for in Section 8.2 of this 
Declaration. Nothing in this Section 9.6 shall be construed to limit the right of any Owner to 
convey or to encumber his allocated interest in the Common Elements as an appurtenance to and 
in connection with the conveyance or mortgaging of his Unit. 
Section 9.7 
Nature of Interest in Unit. Every Unit, together with its allocated interest 
in the Common Elements, shall for all purposes be and it is hereby declared to be and to constitute
