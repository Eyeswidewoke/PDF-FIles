emergence and activities of the Salafists, former Prime Minister Beji Caid Essebsi (in office from 
February 2011 to December 2011) denounced government policy as permissive and accused the 
ruling coalition of failing the country and allowing the democratic process to stagnate. 
Palestinians: At the United Nations General Assembly the Palestinians requested non-member 
state status, a step back after last year's failure to gain acceptance as a state by the Security 
Council. 2012 has not been a good year politically or economically for the Palestinians. Economic 
conditions are deteriorating, Israeli settlement expansion continues, the peace negotiations have 
been on pause, and Palestinian Authority reconciliation with rival llamas seems to be a distant 
possibility. The evolutions of the Arab uprisings and the Iranian nuclear program have the 
attention of the international community rather than the Palestinian cause. There is increasingly 
more talk in some quarters of abandoning the peace process and dissolving the Palestinian 
Authority. According to press reports, President Abbas told the Palestine Liberation Organization 
leadership that on his return from the United Nations General Assembly ministerial (the week of 
September 23'), he wants a decision either to abrogate the Oslo Accords or hold a national 
election to replace him. Experts see this more as posturing than a serious position. Abbas has 
made similar pronouncements in the past. 
5fli : The London-based Syrian Observatory on Human Rights claim that August was the 
bloodiest month since the start of the uprising. The watch group estimated one-fifth of the 25,000 
killed since March 2011 died in August. The large death toll appears to have resulted from the 
opposition's reach into densely populated neighborhoods in Damascus, which drew an 
indiscriminate counterattack by the Bashar Al Assad government. In addition, the Syrian conflict 
continues to spill over into neighboring countries. When the opposition forces evicted the Syrian 
army from a border post aiming to secure their supply lines from Turkey, the intensity of the 
fighting forced Turkish schools in the area to close. Turkey's already restive Kurds are also taking 
advantage of situation. Inspired by Kurdish advances in northeastern Syria, Kurdish fighters have 
been re-energized in their push for autonomy, and Turkey has responded and sent its air force in 
hot pursuit of the Kurds into Iraq. Simultaneously, the conflict in Syria is sharpening the sectarian 
divide in Iraq and pushing the Baghdad government further into the embrace of Iran. 
There are multiple, and seemingly competing, new diplomatic initiatives on Syria. Strong Russian 
pressure on the Al Assad government made it possible for the Syrian domestic opposition to meet 
in Damascus. While Syria's external opposition alleged it was a public relations move 
orchestrated by Al Assad, the meeting's final communiqué, released in the presence of the Russian 
and Chinese ambassadors, called on President Assad to transfer power peacefully. It also 
supported a ceasefire and withdrawal of the regular army from towns and cities. The United 
Nations and Arab League Joint Envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, reported to the Security 
Council on September 24th. He remains reticent regarding the possibility of a peaceful solution 
and is conducting further international consultations before proposing a new diplomatic approach. 
Egypt is also pursuing its Islamic quartet initiative (Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey) and hosted
