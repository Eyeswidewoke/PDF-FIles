option. Company XYZ spins off Company LMN. Company 
XYZ remains the obligor with respect to 70% of the principal 
amount of the anginal reference obligation. Company LMN 
becomes the obligor of a new reference obligation that is 
issued to holders of the remaining 30% of the original refer-
ence obligation. Company XYZ and LMN are identified by 
the listing options market as the successor entities. Follow-
ing the succession event, the credit default option based on 
Company XYZ Is adjusted Into two separate credit default 
option contracts that specify Company XYZ and Company 
LMN as reference entities. The cash settlement amount of 
the original credit default option and the premium multiplier 
are allocated between the new credit default options in 
accordance with the 70/30 division of the reference obliga-
tion as specified by the listing options market. 
Adjustment of credit default basket options after a suc-
cession event. When a succession event occurs with respect 
to a reference entity that is included in a single payout or 
multiple payout credit default basket option, the listing 
options market will ordinarily adjust the option by replacing 
the affected reference entity with the successor entity or 
entities, and, it one or more new obligations are issued to 
replace some or all of the existing reference obligations, the 
new obligations will be substituted as the reference obliga-
tions. The listing options market will specify the weight of 
each new reference entity, and the sum of the weights will 
equal the weight of the original reference entity. 
EXAMPLE: Company XYZ is one of ten equally 
weighted reference entities fore multiple payout default bas-
ket option and its 8% May 15, 2022 bond issue and its 8.5% 
September 1. 2030 bond issue we specified as its only 
reference obligations. During the We of the option, Company 
XYZ spins off Company LMN. Company XYZ remains the 
obligor for the 2022 bond issue and LMN becomes the obli-
gor of a debt security issued to holder of the 2030 bond 
issue. The listing options market adjusts the option by speci-
fying XYZ and LMN as the successor reference entities. The 
reference obligations are the onginal 2022 bond issue and 
the replacement for the 2030 bond issue. The listing options 
market determines the appropriate basket weight for the 
successor reference entities is 7.5% and 2.5%. The sum of 
the newly specified weights equals the 10% weight of the 
predecessor basket reference entity (Company XYZ) 
replaced by the successor reference entities (Company XYZ 
and Company LMN).

SPECIAL RISKS OF CREDIT DEFAULT OPTIONS 
1. 
Pricing of credit default options is complex. As 
stated elsewhere in this document, complexity not well 
understood is, in itself, a risk factor. In order to price Mese 
options, investors must estimate the probability of default 
from available security or other prices, primarily bond and 
credit default swap ("CDS") prices. Models typically used by 
market professionals to infer the probability of default from 
prices may be more complex than the average investor Is 
used to.
