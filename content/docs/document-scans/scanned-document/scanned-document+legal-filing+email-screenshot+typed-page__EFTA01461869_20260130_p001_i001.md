Allegiant purchases new and currently on lease Airbus aircraft 
Allegiant announced earlier this month that the company is purchasing 14 
additional Airbus A320 family aircraft. 
The first of these aircraft will be 
inducted in to the company's fleet in 2015, the second in 2016, and the 
remaining 12 in 2018. The 12 aircraft delivering in 2018 are currently on lease 
to a European carrier, but will be purchased by Allegiant at the end of this 
month. Consequently, the company expects to book $30 million in annual 
rental income beginning at the deal's close and will assume $142 million of 
secured debt. Additionally, Allegiant plans to purchase eight aircraft it had 
previously entered into lease agreements for, two of which the company is 
currently operating, with the remaining six to be delivered in late 2014 through 
2015. As such, Allegiant raised its 2014 CAPEX guidance to $315 million from 
its previous range of $75 to $85 million and introduced 2015 CAPEX guidance 
of $220 million. The company plans to finance these purchases via cash and 
debt financing, including $300 million of unsecured debt the company raised 
last week (due in 2019 with a 5.5% coupon). Management indicated that 
Allegiant will continue to be active in the used Airbus market and "hope to add 
more aircraft...during 2016 and 2017". 
Recent speech by Richard Anderson highlights some of the issues with Open 
Skies agreements 
Earlier in the week, Delta's CEO Richard Anderson presented at the Aero Club 
in 
Washington, 
D.C. 
and 
highlighted 
some 
of 
the 
industry's 
concerns/challenges which could ultimately undermine the sector's recent 
financial success. He stated that the lack of a well-defined US aviation policy 
is a major concern especially since airlines are one of the country's largest 
contributors to the economy (third after energy and agriculture in terms of GDP 
contribution). 
Another challenge highlighted by Anderson relates to the 
enforcement of Open Skies agreements in which the US government per the 
official policy statement "must ensure that competition is fair and the playing 
field is level by eliminating marketplace distortions such as government 
subsidies." We are of the view that this could become a much bigger issue 
sooner than people realize given recent press reports that some beneficiaries 
of US Open Skies agreements have access to sizeable, interest free, 
government loans (or have benefited from significant debt forgiveness by their 
government stakeholders). More often than not, these funds are then used to 
procure aircraft that are placed in markets, which, in many cases, are already 
well-supplied. Furthermore, Anderson stated that our own government has 
exacerbated the situation by giving the competition a boost via lower interest 
costs on aircraft financings guaranteed by the US Export-Import Bank. This 
negatively impacts US airline profitability and employment. 
Amenesan inSong progress on the lebot integration front 
American recently reached tentative, three year, labor deals with the Intl 
Association of Machinists (IAM) covering three separate work groups 
(primarily 11,000 mechanics and airport ground agents) at US Airways. If 
approved, then the company can start negotiations on a joint contract covering 
30,000 employees which includes 19,000 American employees represented by 
the Transport Workers Union (TWU). Thus far, unions for the pilots, flight 
attendants, and service agents have started the process with the National 
Mediation Board to determine which union will represent them.
