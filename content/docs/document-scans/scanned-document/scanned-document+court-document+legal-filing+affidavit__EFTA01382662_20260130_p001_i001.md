Table of Control' 
(a) Includes future principal and cash interest payments on long-term borrowings through scheduled maturity dates. Includes $4.4 billion of 
variable rate debt (including the impact of interest rate swaps). Borrowings and interest rate swaps are discimed in Note 6 "Borrowings" and 
Note 5 "Derivative Financial Instruments." respectively, to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this 
prospectus. Interest payments for the variable rate debt and the associated interest rate swaps were calculated using interest rates as of 
December 31. 2014. 
(b) Represents future payments on existing capital leases, including interest expense, through scheduled expiration dates. 
(e) Includes future pension plan contributions for all plans in 2015 and future contractual commitments for the United Kingdom plan through 
2024 which are subject to change. The amount of pension plan contributions depends upon various factors that cannot be accurately estimated 
beyond a one-year time frame other than the U.K. plan. 
(d) Many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice, and with or without a termination penalty. 
Termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation. Certain contracts also have an automatic renewal clause if we 
do not provide written notification of our intent to terminate the contract. Obligations under certain contracts are usage-based and are, 
therefore, estimated in the above amounts. Historically, we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred 
significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations. 
(e) 
Technology and telecommunications represents obligations related to hardware purchases, including purchases of ATMs and terminals, as 
well as software licenses, hardware and software maintenance and support, technical consulting services, and telecommunications services. 
(f) All other includes obligations related to materials, data, non-technical contract series, facility security, investor management fees, 
maintenance, and marketing promotions. 
As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $262 million of tax contingencies comprised of approximately $238 million reported 
in long-term income taxes payable in the "Other long-term liabilities" line of our consolidated balance sheets, including approximately $4 million 
of income tax liabilities for which The Western Union Company is required to indemnify us, and approximately $24 million recorded as an 
increase of our deferral tax liability. 'These amounts have been excluded from the table because the settlement period cannot be reasonably 
estimated. The timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various tax authorities. 
Critical Accounting Policies 
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and 
has been allocated to reporting units. Our reporting units are businesses at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment 
level for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. 
We test goodwill annually for impairment. as well as upon an indicator of impairment, using a fair value approach at the reporting unit 
level. The fair value of our reporting units is based on a discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions. When appropriate we consider 
assumptions that we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating future cash flows. The key assumptions include 
Adjusted EBI1DA growth and weighted average roost of capital (discount rate). We determined Adjusted EB111)A growth based on management 
estimates and business plans. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective 
reporting unit as well as cost of debt and equity. 
If it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we would estimate the fair value of all of the 
reporting unit's assets and liabilities and calculate an implied fair value of goodwill, which is the difference between the reporting unit's fair value 
and the fair value of all its other assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, the shortfall is recognized 
as impairment. The methodology for estimating fair value varies by asset; however, the most significant assets are intangible assets. We estimate 
the fair value of the intangible assets using the excess earnings method, royalty
