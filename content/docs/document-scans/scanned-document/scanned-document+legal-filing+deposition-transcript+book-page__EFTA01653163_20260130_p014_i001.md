The Washington Times (11/19, Mordock, 492K) reports 
that Inspector Genral Michael E. Horowitz said in a statement 
announcing the report, "Ineffective management and 
oversight of confidential sources can result in jeopardizing 
FBI operations, and placing FBI agents, sources, subjects of 
investigation, and the public in harm's way." The Times adds 
that the report 'dinged the FBI for failing to property supervise 
its confidential human sources (CHS) and ignoring both 
Justice Department and internal guidelines," finding that "the 
FBI failed to validate the credibility of its sources or assess 
the veracity of the information they provided. When such 
reviews were conducted, investigators did not 'review the full 
scope' of the source's long-term work for the FBI. 'FBI 
employees conducting CHS validation reviews told us they 
were discouraged from documenting conclusions and 
recommendations arising from the validation process,' Mr. 
Horowitz wrote in the report." 
The Wall Street Journal (11/19, Forrest, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M) reports that the IG's office interviewed 
more than 100 FBI officials and visited FBI field offices in 
Philadelphia and Washington, DC. The Washington Examiner 
(11/19, Chaitin, 448K) also reports. 
Pentagon IG: US Withdrawal From Northern 
Syria Helps ISIS Reconstitute. 
Politico (11/19, 
O'Brien, 4.29M) says the Pentagon's inspector general 
released a report today, which concludes that President 
Trump's "order to withdraw troops from northern Syria, 
combined with Turkey's assault against Kurdish forces, 
allowed the Islamic State to strengthen its position there." The 
report says "the withdrawal and incursion allowed ISIS to 
'reconstitute capabilities and resources within Syria and 
strengthen its ability to plan attacks abroad:" The IG says the 
DIA predicts that "without counterterrorism pressure, ISIS will 
probably be able to more freely build clandestine networks 
and will attempt to free ISIS members detained in [Syrian 
Democratic Forces]-run prisons and family members living in 
internally displaced persons...camps." Voice of America 
(11/19, Seldin, 48K) reports that that the DIA told the DOD IG 
that the Turkish offensive "will provide the group with time 
and space to expand its ability to conduct transnational 
attacks targeting the West." The Hill (11/19, Kheel, 2.98M) 
adds that the DIA "told the inspector general ISIS exploited 
the Turkish incursion to regroup within Syria and strengthen 
its ability to plan attacks abroad, according to the report." 
Reuters (11/19) reports that the report, "citing the DIA, 
also said that the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-
Baghdadi 'would likely have little effect on ISIS's ability to 
reconstitute.'" 
CQ Roll Call (11/19, Donnelly, 154K) adds that the audit 
"was produced by Glenn Fine, the Defense Department 
inspector general, who is the lead IG for overseeing U.S. 
military operations in Syria and Iraq." The DIA "also told Fine 
that ISIS 'probably will attempt to free' ISIS members 
detained in prisons in Syria. The terrorist group will likely have 
the 'time and space' to target the West and provide support to 
its global branches and networks, Fine wrote." 
Among other news outlets reporting are the Military
Times (11/19, Correll, 772K), NBC News (11/19, Kube, 
Kaplan, 6.14M), Bloomberg (11/19, 4.73M), and USA Today

Giuliani 
Offers 
Bizarre 
Explanation For 
"Misleading" Claims About Clinton. The Guardian 
(UK) (11/15, Kirchgaessner, 4.19M) reports Rudy Giuliani 
"offered the FBI an extraordinary — and seemingly implausible 
— explanation for 'misleading' remarks he made on television 
just a month before the 2016 election about a 'surprise' that 
could derail the Hillary Clinton campaign." He faced justice 
department "scrutiny last year for remarks he made in 
October 2016 that strongly suggested he had insider 
knowledge about a secret FBI investigation into Clinton's 
handling of classified information." In an interview with the 
Guardian this week, "in response to questions about a 2018 
leak investigation into the matter by the Department of 
Justice's inspector general's office, Giuliani acknowledged 
that he told the FBI that he had 'probably misled' people 
when he suggested he had spoken to 'current' and 'active' 
FBI agents about the 'surprise' Clinton was facing." 
Watchdogs Say VA Continues To Struggle 
With Cybersecurity Issues. 
Modern Healthcare 
(11/15, Cohen, Subscription Publication, 214K) reported, 
"Two watchdog agencies told lawmakers Thursday that the 
Veterans Affairs Department continues to struggle with 
cybersecurity issues, despite recent improvements." The 
audits 'identified numerous information security vulnerabilities 
— and insufficient attempts to remedy them — at the VA, 
leaders from the Government Accountability Office and the 
VA Office of Inspector General said during a hearing with the 
House 
Veterans' 
Affairs 
Committee's 
Technology 
Modernization Subcommittee." The VA was just one of an 
additional "18 federal agencies that had ineffective 
information security programs in fiscal 2018, according to a 
report the GAO released this summer." The report examined 
"24 agencies, including HHS and the VA, for compliance with 
the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, a 2014 
law focused on information security in federal agencies." 
OIG Reports Says HHS' Failure To Modernize 
Data Practices Will Limit Ability To Improve 
Nation's Health. 
Health Data Management (11/19, 
Slabodkin) reports, 'How the Department of Health and 
Human Services manages, shares and secures its data is 
among the top management and performance challenges 
facing the agency," according to an "assessment of the HHS 
Office of Inspector General, which contends that failure to
