Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Ittbk of Contents 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
Guarantees 
The company is party to a variety of contractual agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for 
certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to the company's commercial contracts, operating leases and other real estate 
contracts, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these agreements, the company 
may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (for example, ownership of assets, environmental 
or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly 
defined. The company believes that if it were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on the 
company's financial statements. 
Letters of Credit 
The company had letters of credit of $660.1 million outstanding as of June 20, 2015. The letters of credit are maintained primarily 
to support performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the company. The company pays fees ranging from the London 
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.5% to LIBOR plus 3.0% plus a fronting fee of 0.125% on the face amount of the letters of credit. 
New Accounting Policies Not Yet Adopted 
See Note 1—Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated 
financial statements, included elsewhere in this prospectus, for new accounting pronouncements which have not yet been adopted. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of 
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates. 
We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and 
financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a fair and consistent manner. See Note 1—Description of Business, Basis of 
Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this 
prospectus, for a discussion of our significant accounting policies. 
Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
Vendor Allowances 
Consistent with standard practices in the retail industry, we receive allowances from many of the vendors whose products we buy 
for resale in our stores. These vendor allowances are provided to increase the sell-through of the related products. We receive vendor 
allowances for a variety of merchandising activities: placement of the vendors' products in our advertising; display of the vendors' 
products in prominent locations in our stores; supporting the introduction of new products into our retail stores and distribution systems; 
exclusivity rights in certain categories: and to compensate for
