access to through "marriage." Although much of his paraphilic sexual activity 
with adults may not be criminal, such an individual may provide his children to 
other adults or use the children of other adults as part of group sex, spouse-swap-

The purpose of this descriptive typology is not to gain insight or understanding 
about why child molesters have sex with children in order to help or treat them, 
but to recognize and evaluate how child molesters have sex with children in 
order to identify, arrest, and convict them. Things such as what evidence to look 
for, whether there are additional victims, how to identify those victims, and how 
to interview a suspect depend on the type of child molester involved. 
There are many advantages to the use of this criminal-justice, descriptive 
typology. If there is a need to distinguish a certain type of sex offender, this typol-
ogy provides a name or label instead of just calling them "these guys." The label is 
professional in contrast to referring to them as "perverts," "sickos," or worse. 
Because the terms are descriptive (not diagnostic) and probative (not prejudicial), 
they may be more acceptable in reports, search warrants, and testimony by crimi-
nal-justice professionals. For example the currently popular term "predator" might 
be considered too prejudicial for some court testimony. The continuum concept 
also better addresses the complexity of and changes in human behavior. Using 
the term "preferential sex offender" instead of "preferential child molester," 
addresses the issue of applying it to offenders who collect child pornography 
without physically molesting children. The one term, preferential sex offender, 
eliminates the need for investigators and prosecutors to distinguish between child-
pornography collectors and child molesters, between pedophiles and hebephiles, 
and among numerous other paraphilias. How to recognize and identify such 
offenders will be discussed shortly. 
Investigators might argue that it is their job to investi-
gate individuals who violate the law, and whether or not 
that offender is a pedophile or preferential sex offender is 
of little importance to them. There is no legal requirement 
to determine that a subject or suspect in a case is a pedo-
phile or preferential-type sex offender. Often it is irrelevant 
to the investigation or prosecution. There are, however, dear 
differences between the types of individuals who sexually 
victimize children, and investigators and prosecutors han-
dling these cases sometimes need to make such distinctions. 
The terms situational and preferential sex offender are 
merely descriptive labels to be used only to identify, for 
investigative and prosecutive purposes, a certain type of 
offender. The terms do not appear in the DSM-IV-TR, and 
they are not intended to imply or be used for a clinical 
diagnosis. 
Although there is not a "profile" that will determine if someone is a child 
molester, preferential sex offenders tend to engage in highly predictable and rec-
