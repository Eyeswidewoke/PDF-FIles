Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Labor shortages or increases in labor costs could slow our growth and 
adversely affect our ability to operate our restaurants. 
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, motivate and 
retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and gaucho 
chefs necessary to meet the needs of our existing restaurants and to support 
our expansion program. Qualified personnel to fill these positions may 
be in short supply in some areas. If we are unable to continue to recruit 
and retain sufficiently qualified personnel, our business and our growth 
could be adversely affected. Any future inability to recruit and retain 
qualified personnel may delay openings of new restaurants and could 
adversely impact existing restaurants. Any such delays, any material 
increases in employee turnover rates in existing restaurants or any employee 
dissatisfaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and 
results of operations. In addition, competition for qualified employees 
could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor 
costs, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial 
performance. 
Increases in minimum wages or unionization activities could substantially 
increase our labor costs. 
Under the minimum wage laws in most jurisdictions in the United States, we 
are permitted to pay certain hourly employees a wage that is less 
than the base minimum wage for general employees because these employees 
receive tips as a substantial part of their income. As of March 29, 
2015, approximately 33.7% of our employees in the United States earn this 
lower minimum wage in their respective locations as tips constitute a 
substantial part of their income. If federal, state or local governments 
change their laws to require that all employees be paid the general employee 
minimum base wage regardless of supplemental tip income, our labor costs 
would increase substantially. Our labor costs would also increase if the 
minimum base wage increases. We may be unable or unwilling to increase our 
prices in order to pass increased labor costs on to our guests, in 
which case our operating margins would be adversely affected. Also, although 
none of our employees in the United States are currently covered 
under collective bargaining agreements, our employees in Brazil participate 
in industry-wide trade union programs. Additionally, our employees in 
the United States may elect or attempt to be represented by labor unions in 
the future. If a significant number of our employees were to become 
unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly 
different from our current compensation arrangements, it could adversely 
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions, our inability to 
obtain necessary visas and work permits for foreign workers and 
changes in United States immigration laws and regulations, particularly with 
respect to L-1B visa eligibility. 
Our future success could depend on our ability to attract and retain 
employees with specialized culinary skills. Many of our gaucho chefs in 
the United States are Brazilian nationals whose ability to work in the 
United States depends on obtaining and maintaining necessary visas and work 
permits (which may or may not be tied to their employment with us).
