such images must be expanded to also include the fact that virtual child pornog-
raphy fuels and validates the sexual fantasies of child molesters and pedophiles, 
potentially harms nondepicted children, and can be traded for images involving 
"real" children. Unlike items such as candy bars, virtual child pornography 
has no socially redeeming value. 
Collecting child pornography validates the behavior of and provides incen-
tive for those who do produce it. The number of "hits" on a site almost always 
measures status and success on the Internet. Every time individuals download 
child pornography on the Internet, they are leaving an implied message behind 
that the material has value, and they will be back to get more. Since there is a 
limited amount of existing material, at some point someone has to produce new 
images. 
Offenders who "just" traffic in child pornography are committing serious 
violations of the law that do not necessarily require proving that they are also 
child molesters. If it is relevant and the facts support it, such individuals can be 
considered preferential sex offenders because such behavior is an offense. Some ' 
offenders who traffic in child pornography, especially the diverse-preferential sex 
offender, may have significant collections of adult pornography as well. In some 
cases they may even have far more adult pornography than child pornography. 
Such offenders may not be "pedophiles," but can still be preferential sex offend-
ers with many similar behavior patterns.

Many investigators and prosecutors do not like child-pornography cases. Some 
do everything they can to deny the problem and avoid these cases. Some federal 
investigators and prosecutors (also some federal judges and federal law-enforce-
ment administrators) do not believe that child-pornography cases are the 
business of the federal courts. Many prosecutors are up-front and honest about 
their feelings. Others, however, avoid these cases by sending investigators on 
impossible stalling missions to "bring them the broomstick of the wicked witch." 
Instead of declining unwanted cases, they avoid them by asking for more and 
more evidence without ever really intending to prosecute. 
Part of this problem is due to distorted and exaggerated information dissemi-
nated at "professional" training conferences. Some seem to feel that investigating 
and prosecuting child pornography is a divine mission from God to save the moral 
character of the country. This motivates some investigators and prosecutors, but 
turns off many others. It enables many to argue that these cases are about a 
religious agenda rather than enforcing the law. 
Investigators and prosecutors should have an objective and rational under-
standing of the nature of child pornography. There is no legal requirement that 
collectors of it be physically molesting children, making money, part of orga-
nized crime, or totally "evil" sexual predators. There is no legal requirement 
that the children portrayed in it be abducted, suffering in pain, nonconsentirtg, 
or totally "good" victims. Investigators and prosecutors must be able to 
professionally deal with the subject matter of deviant sexual behavior. This 
usually requires a willingness to view at least a reasonable quantity of the images 
being prosecuted. It is hard for investigators, prosecutors, judges, and juries to 
make legal decisions about something they refuse to look at
