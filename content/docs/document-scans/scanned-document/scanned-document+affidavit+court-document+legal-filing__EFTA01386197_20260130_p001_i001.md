AGP LP 519 Alpha Group Capital Paul Barrett 
orders; software that provides trade analytics and trading strategies; software used to transmit orders; 
clearance and settlement in connection with a trade; electronic communication of allocation instructions; 
routing settlement instructions; post trade matching of trade information; and services required by the SEC 
or a self-regulatory organization such as comparison services, electronic confirms or trade affirmations. 
In some instances, the Investment Manager may receive a product or service that may be used 
only partially for functions within Section 28(e) (e.g., an order management system, trade analytical 
software or proxy services). In such instances, the Investment Manager will make a good faith effort to 
determine the relative proportion of the product or service used to assist the Investment Manager in 
carrying out its investment decision-making responsibilities and the relative proportion used for 
administrative or other purposes outside Section 28(e). The proportion of the product or service attributable 
to assisting the Investment Manager in carrying out its investment decision-making responsibilities will be 
paid through brokerage commissions generated by client transactions and the proportion attributable to 
administrative or other purposes outside Section 28(e) will be paid for by the Investment Manager from its 
own resources. 
Research and brokerage services obtained by the use of commissions arising from the 
Partnership's portfolio transactions may be used by the Investment Manager in its other investment 
activities and thus, the Partnership may not necessarily, in any particular instance, be the direct or indirect 
beneficiary of the research or brokerage services provided. 
Although the Investment Manager will make a good faith determination that the amount of 
commissions paid is reasonable in light of the products or services provided by a broker, commission rates 
are generally negotiable and thus, selecting brokers on the basis of considerations that are not limited to the 
applicable commission rates may result in higher transaction costs than would otherwise be obtainable. 
The receipt of such products or services and the determination of the appropriate allocation in the case of 
"mixed use" products or services creates a potential conflict of interest between the Investment Manager 
and its clients. 
In selecting brokers and negotiating commission rates, the Investment Manager will take into 
account the financial stability and reputation of brokerage firms, and the research, brokerage or other 
services provided by such brokers. The Investment Manager may place transactions with a broker or 
dealer that (i) provides the Investment Manager (or an affiliate) with the opportunity to participate in capital 
introduction events sponsored by the broker-dealer or (i) refers investors to the Partnership or other 
products advised by the Investment Manager (or an affiliate), if otherwise consistent with seeking best 
execution; provided the Investment Manager is not selecting the broker-dealer in recognition of the 
opportunity to participate in such capital introduction events or the referral of investors. 
When appropriate, the Investment Manager may, but is not required to, aggregate client orders to 
achieve more efficient execution or to provide for equitable treatment among accounts. Clients participating 
in aggregated trades will be allocated securities based on the average price achieved for such trades. 
It should be noted that the Investment Manager is a non-managing member of Breakwater Group 
Distribution Services, LLC ("Breakwater"), a broker-dealer that employs certain of the Investment 
Manager's employees. Breakwater acts as the distributor for other investment funds sponsored by an 
affiliate of the Investment Manager and does not maintain a trading function. 
The Partnership maintains accounts at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, its prime brokers, 
through which the Partnership may execute trades, borrow securities and maintain custody of its securities, 
atthough the Partnership may also be required (or find it advantageous) to maintain custody of certain of its 
non-U.S. securities at brokers or financial institutions located in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, the 
Partnership also maintains back-up custodial arrangements with the Custodians, all and any of which may 
be affiliated with the prime brokers and Administrator used by the Partnership. Such arrangements, to the 
extent they are utilized, are intended to reduce the risks of having the Partnership's assets held in the 
custody of the Prime Brokers. The Partnership reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change its 
brokerage and custodial arrangements without prior notice to Limited Partners.
