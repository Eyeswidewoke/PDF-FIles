NUMEROUS ISSUES REMAIN WITH RESPECT TO THE TOPICS ADDRESSED BY SUCH REGULATIONS. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL RELEASE ADDITIONAL 
GUIDANCE, IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN ANY ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE WILL BE RELEASED, OR IN WHAT MANNER THE TREASURY WILL RESOLVE THE MANY AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE 
QOF PROGRAM. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS LEGISLATION ALSO MAY BE NEEDED FROM CONGRESS TO CLARIFY CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF 7HE TWA AND TO GIVE PROPER EFFECT TO 
CONGRESSIONAL INTENT. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED THAT ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION WILL BE ENACTED, AND EVEN IF ENACTED, ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION MAY NOT CLEARLY 
ADDRESS ALL ITEMS THAT REQUIRE OR WOULD BENEFIT FROM CLARIFICATION.

PRACTICES OF A PARALLEL LLC IN ORDER TO PERMIT THAT PARALLEL LLC TO QUALIFY AS A QOF OR FOR INVESTOR MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE CERTAIN OF THE ANTICIPATED 
TAX BENEFITS OF INVESTING IN A QOF. THE MANAGING MEMBER MAY ALSO DETERMINE, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, 70 CHANGE THE STRUCTURE, INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND/OR

CURRENT OR ANTICIPATED STRUCTURE, INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND/OR PRACTICES (OR OTHERWISE) OF THE PARALLEL LLCS, A PARALLEL LLC WILL BE UNABLE TO QUAUFY AS A 
QOF OR PROVIDE INVESTOR MEMBERS WITH SUCH ANTICIPATED TAX BENEFITS, THE MANAGING MEMBER WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE CHANGES TO A PARALLEL LLC IN 
ORDER FOR SUCH PARALLEL LTC TO QUALIFY AS A QOF. FURTHER, ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE MAY PROVIDE THAT, MA RESULT OF THE PARALLEL TICS

SUBCHAPTER Z, AND THAT THERE ARE NO REMEDIES THAT THE MANAGING MEMBER WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE IN ORDER TO QUAUFY SUCH PARALLEL LLC TO RECEIVE SUCH 
BENEFITS. IN ADDITION, IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION IS NOT ENACTED OR FURTHER ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE IS NOT PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF A PARTICULAR 
MATTER RELATING TO SUBCHAPTER Z, A PARALLEL LLC MAY TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS BASED ON ITS ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN 
SUBCHAPTER Z AGAINST WHICH THE IRS MAY ASSERT A CONTRARY POSITION, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE PARALLEL LLC, ITS STATUS AS A QOF, AND THE TAX 
BENEFITS OTHERWISE AFFORDED TO THE INVESTORS IN A PARALLEL LLC UNDER SUBCHAPTER Z. 
IN ADDITION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS PRESENTATION OR THE MEMORANDUM TO THE CONTRARY, THE MANAGING MEMBER MAY DETERMINE, AT ANY TIME, TO CEASE 
MANAGING ANY PARALLEL LLC IN A MANNER DESIGNED TO QUALIFY SUCH PARALLEL LLC M A QOF AND/OR TO SEEK TO PROVIDE CERTAIN OR ALL INVESTORS IN THE FUND WITH THE
