Trust Co., Inc. v. Citibank, N.A., Order, Civ. No.2002-108 (D.V.I. Dec. 13, 
2002). 
The defendants charge that plaintiffs' suit in the Virgin Islands is merely 
"a transparent attempt to launch a preemptive strike to hamper Citibank's 
efforts to recover the $20 million in promissory notes... upon which Epstein 
has defaulted." (Mem. Of Law in Support of Def.'s Mot. To Dismiss at 2.) The 
defendants move to dismiss this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction, or alternatively, to transfer 
this case to the Southern District of New York under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). 
Finally, the defendants aver that the amended complaint fails to state a 
cause of action upon which relief may be granted under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 12(b)(6) and does not allege fraud with the requisite 
particularity as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). I address 
each argument in turn. 
II. DISCUSSION 
A. This Court has Personal Jurisdiction over Citibank and Citigroup 
The defendants maintain that Citibank discontinued its presence in the 
Virgin Islands in 1999 and that Citigroup is merely a holding company that 
"does not have and never has had any assets, offices or employees in the 
Virgin Islands." In addition, the defendants insist that the events giving 
rise to this cause of action have no connection with the Virgin Islands. 
(Mem. of Law in Support of Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 6-9.) The plaintiffs 
counter that the defendants are currently doing business in the Virgin 
Islands and that this Court has jurisdiction over the defendants under the 
Virgin Islands' Long-Arm Statute. The plaintiffs insist that the defendants' 
depiction of Citigroup as a "holding company" is belied by Citigroup's 
public disclosures that the plaintiffs claim do not identify Citibank as a 
separate subsidiary or affiliate of Citigroup. (Pls.' Mem. Of Law in Opp'n 
to Mot. to Dismiss at 16-24.) 
I agree with the plaintiffs and find that this Court has personal 
jurisdiction over the defendants under the Virgin Islands Long-Arm Statute 
and that, under the United States Constitution, the defendants have had 
enough "minimum contacts" with the Virgin Islands to require them to defend 
a lawsuit in this jurisdiction. This Court sitting in diversity exercises 
personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant pursuant to the forum's 
long-arm statute and in compliance with the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment's "minimum contacts" requirement. See In re Tutu Wells 
Contamination Litig., 846 F.Supp. 1243, 1264 (D.Vi.1993) (citing 
International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 
95 (1945)). When a defendant moves under Rule 12(b)(2) to dismiss for lack 
of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of 
sufficient contacts between the defendant and the forum territory to support 
in personam jurisdiction, see Mellon Bank (East) PSFS Nat'l Ass'n v. Farino, 
960 F.2d 1217, 1223 (3d Cir.1992), and the court must accept all of the 
plaintiff's allegations as true and construe disputed facts in favor of the 
plaintiff, see Carteret Say. Bank, FA v. Shushan, 954 F.2d 141, 143 n. 1 (3d
