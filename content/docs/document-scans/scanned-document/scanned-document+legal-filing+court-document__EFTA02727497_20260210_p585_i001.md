2. Presentation of Helicopter for Acceptance - The Helicopter shall be presented for 
acceptance at the Sikorsky designated facility in Connecticut (the "Designated Facility") on 
the Scheduled Presentation Dates. Upon Buyer's request for a demonstration flight of the 
Helicopter, Sikorsky shall conduct a demonstration flight at the Designated Facility during 
such presentation, which flight shall be approximately one (1) hour in duration or longer as 
may reasonably be necessary. Buyer's obligation to purchase the Helicopter is conditioned 
upon and subject to Buyer being satisfied that the Helicopter is in airworthy condition with all 
flight critical systems functional and in proper working order, and has been manufactured in 
accordance with the specifications of this Agreement and that the Helicopter has no damage, 
corrosion or other defects. 
3. Acceptance and Title Transfer - After presentation of the Helicopter, Buyer shall evidence 
its acceptance of the Helicopter by executing a Certificate of Helicopter Acceptance. Upon 
Buyers execution of the Certificate of Helicopter Acceptance, and payment of the Baseline 
Helicopter Final Payment pursuant to Section III.1.b., Sikorsky shall transfer title to Buyer at 
the Designated Facility. Following title transfer, Sikorsky shall provide to Buyer a FAA 
Certificate of Airworthiness, a Bill of Sale and a Warranty Bill of Sale (Exhibit C). Sikorsky 
shall retain custody of the Helicopter for the purpose of the performance of the Completion 
Services. As part of the Completion Services, Sikorsky will transport the Helicopter, at 
Sikorsky's expense, from Connecticut, to Sikorsky's designated completion center (the 
"Completion Center") via ferry flight. Upon its arrival at the Completion Center, the Helicopter 
shall be inducted into the facility in order to allow the performance of the Completion 
Services. 
4. No Prospective Registration of Interest- Prior to the transfer of title as provided in this 
Agreement, Buyer, without the prior written consent of Sikorsky, shall neither register nor 
consent to the ability of any person to register any interest in the Helicopter or its engines on 
the International Registry, including without limitation, any prospective international interest, 
pursuant to that body of law know as the Cape Town Treaty Convention on International 
Interests in Mobile Equipment and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in 
Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (hereinafter the "Cape Town 
Treaty"). Any consent by Sikorsky to registration of any interest in the Helicopter or its 
engines shall be subject to among other things at Sikorsky's sole discretion, receipt by 
Sikorsky of all payments due under this Agreement at the time of title transfer of the 
Helicopter to Buyer. Registration of any interest under the Cape Town Treaty in violation of 
this paragraph shall be deemed ineffective as against Sikorsky and Buyer shall immediately 
upon request of Sikorsky and at Buyers expense, take all required action to remove any such 
interest or other encumbrance on the Helicopter in connection therewith. 
5. Risk of Loss - Sikorsky shall have risk of loss of the Helicopter, subsequent to the transfer of 
title through Buyer's acceptance of the Completion Services. In the event that the Helicopter 
is damaged or the functionality is in any way compromised during the conduct of the 
Completion Services, Sikorsky shall be required, as a part of the Completion Services, to 
repair such damage or restore such functionality to as good condition as new. Buyer agrees 
that any insurance proceeds for such repair shall be paid directly to Sikorsky. In the event
