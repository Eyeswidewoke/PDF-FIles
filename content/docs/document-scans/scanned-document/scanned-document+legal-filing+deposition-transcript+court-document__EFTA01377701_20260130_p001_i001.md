S-I/A 
Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets 
We apply the provisions of ASC 805. Business Combinations, in the accounting for acquisitions. It requires us to recognize 
separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the 
acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently 
uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition 
date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the 
conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever 
comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.

Uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially 
estimated as of the acquisition date. We review these items during the measurement period as we continue to actively seek and 
collect information relating to facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Changes to these uncertain tax positions 
and tax related valuation allowances made subsequent to the measurement period, or if they relate to facts and circumstances that 
did not exist at the acquisition date, are recorded in our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations. 
We perform a goodwill impairment test annually on December 31 and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate 
that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test is performed in accordance with FASB ASC 350—Intangibles—Goodwill and 
Other, and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. We have 
the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that 
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and determine whether further action is needed. If, after assessing 
the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than 
its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. As of December 31. 2014. no impairment of 
goodwill was recorded. 
Acquired intangibles consist of acquired technology and customer relationships associated with various acquisitions. Acquired 
technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income-producing capabilities of 
software services acquired in acquisitions. We amortize acquired technology over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis 
within cost of revenue. Customer relationships represent relationships that we have with customers of the acquired companies and 
are either based upon contractual or legal rights or are considered separable; that is, capable of being separated from the acquired 
entity and being sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. These customer relationships are initially recorded at their fair 
value based on the present value of expected future cash flows. We amortize customer relationships on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful lives within our operating expenses. We evaluate the remaining estimated useful life of our intangible assets 
being amortized on an ongoing basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of 
amortization. 
Income Taxes 
We report income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB 
ASC) 740, Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying 
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. 
Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are 
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in 
income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is 
more likely than not to be realized. 
We use financial projections to support our net deferred tax assets, which contain significant assumptions and estimates of 
future operations. If such assumptions were to differ significantly from actual future results of operations, it may have a material 
effect on our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. At the end of each quarterly period, we assess the ability to realize the 
deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that we would not realize the deferred tax assets, then we would establish a 
valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets.
