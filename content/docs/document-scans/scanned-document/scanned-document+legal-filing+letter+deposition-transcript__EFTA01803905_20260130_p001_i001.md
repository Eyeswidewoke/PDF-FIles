I posted some thoughts on UI and our minds. It's not the network of =inds that Jeffrey's interested in, but this is one 
element of the =eception and brain stuff that I'm interested in. Thanks for the edits =evin.

Designing around little minds 
In designing user interfaces, we aim to empower the "user" to =nderstand and control the system at hand. Output via 
screens and =peakers, with input from a keyboard, a touch screen or gestures. =etween them, the "user" is understood 
to be our conscious "mind" =96 the logical bit of our brain that thinks it's in charge. 
This "mind" is actually not nearly as "in charge" as it thinks =t is. In fact, our larger and often much more wise mind — the 
=motional, sub-conscious, parallel-processing, pattern recognizing part =f our nervous system even manipulates and 
deceives our conscious mind. =rticulated long ago as Dual Process Theory, Kahneman formalizes them as =ystem 1 (this 
vast, quick and automatic aspect of thinking) and System = (the small "conscious" mind that logically considers and 
judges). = There is a basic fitness function to having our conscious mind feel =onfident, whether fighting, mating, or 
even making the small decisions =hat people make to get through a day. But the confidence we are =uilding is with the 
small and logical part of our minds, deceiving =urselves that things are ok when another part of ourselves might know 
=therwise. 
This is articulated in an experiment described by Trivers in which =ubjects are asked to listen to a series of voices, some 
of which are =heir own. Depending on the confidence of the subjects, some tended to =ttribute their voice to others ... 
or conversely, mistake other voices =s their own. The interesting thing was that the galvanic skin response =hat connects 
to our parasympathetic nervous system always reacted =onsistently to our own voices, even when our conscious minds 
were =eceived. (Trivers 1985) 
Whether it's the decisions we make or the assessments of how we feel, =e are consistently persuading ourselves that 
the world is organized and =oherent, and that we understand what's going on, most of the time. In =act, the world is 
complex and chaotic. Most of what goes on in the =orld -- and even in our own bodies -- is beyond the comprehension 
and =luckily) the control of our little minds. 
Thus, good design communicates with the broader, faster, more emotional =ystem. What we call the "flow state" or "in 
the zone" is just =ur little minds getting out of the way so that our bigger and more =ntuitive mind can run the show. 
Whether throwing a basketball or =riving a car, if our logical minds were coordinating each step, it =ould be impossibly 
difficult to coordinate all of the steps. However, =ur little minds are "smart" enough to get out of the way when we =ave 
mastery and allow the rest of the system dominate. 
Why is it then that we seem to insist on building and assessing our =ystems based on what our little mind thinks? Think 
about the testing in =chools that only measures local knowledge and logical skills, or =esigning user interfaces around 
what the user is focused on like =ull-down menus and the mouse pointer.
