[HN3] The law does not require an antitrust plaintiff to show that the defendant's wrongful 
action was the sole proximate cause of the injury sustained. The plaintiff need only prove, 
with a fair degree of certainty, that defendant's illegal conduct materially contributed to the 
injury.

[HN4) It is enough that the illegality is shown to be a material cause of the injury; a plaintiff 
need not exhaust all possible alternative sources of injury in fulfilling his burden of proving 
compensable injury under § 4 of the Clayton Act.

[HN5] Standing to prosecute a private antitrust action under § 4 of the Clayton Act requires 
the plaintiff to prove that he is within that sector of the economy, which is endangered by a 
breakdown of competitive conditions in a particular industry. The plaintiff must be the 
target against which anticompetitive activity is directed. The injury must be of the type the 
antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' 
act unlawful. Incidental or consequential injury or injury remotely caused by an antitrust 
violation does not give a plaintiff standing to complain that he has been injured by reason 
of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.

Civil Procedure > Justiciability > Standing > General Overview 
[NNE] Neither an officer nor an employee of a corporation has standing to bring an action 
in his own right for an antitrust violation causing injury to the corporation and its business. 
Such persons may suffer indirect or secondary financial injury from antitrust violations, but 
they are not the target of the anticompetitive practices. 
Civil Procedure > Parties > Self-Representation > General Overview 
[HN7] See 28 U.S.C.S. § 1654. 
Civil Procedure > Parties > Self-Representation > General Overview 
[HN8] Corporations must always be represented by legal counsel.

Civil Procedure > Parties > Substitutions > General Overview 
[HN9] Georgia law provides that a cause of action on behalf of a corporation, which is the 
subject of litigation pending on the date of dissolution, may continue to be prosecuted by 
the corporation in its corporate name. Ga. Code Ann. § 14-2-293 (1982). A dissolved 
corporation may maintain a federal suit when it has been given that power by state law.
