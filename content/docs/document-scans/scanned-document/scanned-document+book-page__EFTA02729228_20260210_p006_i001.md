being so brutal as to be "irresponsible." 
One reporter in fact, received three threats 
from Epstein while preparing a piece. They 
were delivered in a jocular tone, but the 
message was clear: Thera. will be trouble 
for your family if I don't like the article. 
On the other hand, Epstein is clearly 
wry generous with friends. Joc Pagano, an 
Aspen-based venture capitalist. who has 
known Epstein since before his Bear Steams 
days. can't say enough nice things: 
have 
a boy who's dyslexic. and Jeffrey's gotten 
close to him over the years.... Jeffrey got 
him into music. He bought him his first 
piano. And that as he got to school he had 
difficulty ... in studying ... so Jeffrey got 
him interestel in taking flying lessons." 
Rosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling 
her that her daughter. Domenica, who sub 
fen from Down syndrome. needed the sun, 
and that Rosa should feel free to bring her 
to his house in Palm Beach anytime. 
Some friends remember that in the late 
80s Epstein would otter to upgrade the air-
line tickets of good friends by affixing fiat-
class stickers: the only problem was that the 
stickers turned out to be unofficial. Some-
times the technique worked. but other times 
didn't. and the unwitting recipients found 
themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has 
claimed that he paid tbr the upgrades, and 
had no knowledge of the stickers] Many of 
those who benefited from Epstein's largesse 
claim chat his generosity comes with no 
strings attached. "1 never felt he wanted 
anything from me in return." says one old 
friend. who received a first-class upgrade.

wan is known about town 
as a man who loves wom-
en—lots of them. mostly 
young. Model types have 
been heard saying they are 
full of gratitude to Epstein 
for thing them around, and 
he is j 413111i:1r face to many of the Victo-
ria's Secret girls. One young woman recalls 
being summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to 
a concert at Epstein's town house. where 
the women seemed to outnumber the men 
by far. "These were not women you'd see 
at Upper East Side dinners." the woman 
recalls. "Many seemed foreign and dressed 
a link bizarrely." This same guest also at-
tended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell 
that Prince Andrew attended, which was 
tilled, she says, with young Russian mod-
els. "Some of the guests were horrified." 
the woman says. 
"He's reckless," says a former business 
associate, "and he's gotten more so. Mon-
ey does that to you. He's breaking the oath 
he made to himself—that he would never 
do anything that would expose him in the

mAl2M 2003 
media. Right now, in the wake of the pub-
licity following his trip with Clinton, he 
must be in a very difficult place." 
A
ecording to S.E.C. and 
other legal documents un-
earthed by Vanity Fair, 
Epstein may have good 
reason to keep his past 
cloaked in secrecy his real 
mentor, it might seem, vas 
not Leslie Wexner but Steven Jude Reifen-
berg. 57 who, for a few months before the 
S,E.C. sued to freeze his assets in 1991 was 
trying to buy the Aar NA Post. He is cur-
rently incarcerated in the Federal Medical 
Center in Deans. Massachusetts. 'ening a 
20-year sentence for bilking investors out of 
more than 5450 million in one of the largest 
Paul schemes in American history, 
When Epstein met Reifenberg in Lon-
don in the 1980s. the latter was the char-
ismatic. audacious head of the Towers 
Financial Corporation. a collection agency 
that was supposed to buy debts that peo-
pk owed to hospitals. banks. and phone 
companies. But HotTenbera began using 
company funds to pay off earlier investors 
and service a lavish lifestyle that included a 
mansion on Long Island. homes on Man-
hattan's Sutton Place and in Florida. and a 
fleet of ears and planes. 
Floffenberg and Epstein had much in 
common. Both were smart and obsessed 
with making money. Bah were from Brook-
lyn. According to Holfenberg. the ovo men 
were introduced by Douglas Leese. a de-
knse contractor. Epstein has said they were 
introduced M. John Mitchell. the late attor-
ney general. 
Epstein had been running Internatienal 
Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.1. a consulting 
company. out of his apartment in the Solo 
building on East 66th Street in Nen York. 
Though he has claimed that he managed 
money for billionaires only. in a laiee dep-
osition he testified that he spent SO per-
cent of his time helping people recover 
stolen money from fraudulent brokers and 
lawyers. lie was also not above entering 
into risky. tax-sheltered oil and gas deals 
with much smaller investors. A lawsuit that 
Michael Stroll, the former head of Wil-
liams Electronics Inc.. filed against Epstein 
shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an in-
vestment from Stroll of 5450.000. which 
Epstein put into oil. In 1984. Stroll asked 
for his money back: four years later he had 
received only 510.000. Stroll lost the suit. 
after Epstein claimed in court, among oth-
er things, that the check for 510.000 was for 
a horse he'd bought from Stroll. "My net 
worth never exceeded four and a half mil-
lion dollars.' Stroll has said.

Hoffenberg, says a close friend, "really 
liked Jeffrey.... Jeffrey has a way of getting 
under your skin, and he was under Hof-
Embers 's." Also appealing to Hoffenberg 
were Epstein's social connections; they in-
eluded oil mogul Cede Wang (father of the 
designer Wm) and Mohan Murjani, whose 
clothing company grew into Gloria Van-
data Jeans. Epstein lived large even then. 
One friend recalls that when he took Cana-
dian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he 
hired a Rolls-Royce especially for the oc-
casion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.) 
In 1987, Reifenberg according to sources, 
set Epstein up in the offices he still occu-
pies in the Villard House. on Madison Av-
enue. across a courtyard from the restaurant 
Le Cirque. Hoffenberg hired his new pro-
tégé as a consultant at 515.000 a month. 
and the relationship flourished. "They trav-
eled everywheie together—on Holrenberg's 
plane. all around the world. they were al-
ways together," says a source. Hoffenberg 
has claimed that Epstein confided in him, 
saying. for example. that he had left Bear 
Steams in 1981 after he was discovered ex-
ecutine "illegal operations" 
Several of Epstein's bar Stearns contem-
poraries recall that Epstein left the compa-
ny van suddenly. 1%ithin the company there 
were rumors also that he was invoked in a 
technical infringement. and it was thought 
that the executive committee asked that he 
resign after his two supporters..Xce Green-
berg and Jimmy Cmne. were outnumbered. 
Greenberg says he can't recall this: Cayne 
denies it happened. and Epstein has de-
nied it as well. -JetTrey Epstein left Bear 
Steams of his own volition." says Cayne. 
"It was never suggested that he leave by 
any member of management. and manage-
ment never looked into any improprieties 
by him. Jeffrey said specifically. 'I don't 
want to work for anybody else. I want to 
work for myself— Net, this is not the story 
that Epstein told to the S.F..C. in 1981 and 
to lawyers in a 1989 deposition invoh ing a 
civil business case in Philadelphia. 
In 1981 the S.E.C.'s Jonathan Harris and 
Robert Blackburn took Epstein's testimony 
and that of other Beat Steams employres in 
part of what became a protracted ease 
about insider trading around a tender offer 
placed on March II. 1981. by the Seagram 
Company Ltd for St. Joe Minerals Corp. 
Ultimately several Italian and Swiss in-
vestors were found guihy. including Italian 
financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used 
his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar 
Bronfman Sr. to obtain information about 
the tender of
