trust account described below as of two business days prior to the 
consummation of our initial business combination, including interest 
(which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then 
outstanding shares of common stock that were sold as part of 
the units in this offering, which we refer to collectively as our public 
shares, subject to the limitations described herein. If we are unable to 
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this 
offering, we will redeem 100% of the public shares at a pershare 
price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the 
trust account, including interest (less up to $50,000 of 
interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of 
taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public 
shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. 
Our sponsor, Global Partner Sponsor I LLC (which we refer to as our 
"sponsor" throughout this prospectus) has committed to purchase an 
aggregate of 11,600,000 warrants (or 12,815,000 warrants if the over-
allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $0.50 per warrant 
($5,800,000 in the aggregate, or $6,407,500 if the over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) in a private placement that will close 
simultaneously with the closing of this offering. We refer to these warrants 
throughout this prospectus as the private placement warrants. 
Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one-half of one 
share of our common stock at $5.75 per half share. 
Currently, there is no public market for our units, common stock or 
warrants. We have applied to list our units on the NASDAQ Capital 
Market, or NASDAQ, under the symbol "GPACU" on or promptly after the date of 
this prospectus. We cannot guarantee that our securities 
will be approved for listing on NASDAQ. The common stock and warrants 
comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day 
following the date of this prospectus unless Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. 
informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject 
to our filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, or the SEC, containing an audited balance sheet 
reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds of this offering and issuing a 
press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. 
Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, we expect 
that the common stock and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ 
under the symbols "GPAC" and "GPACW," respectively. 
We are an "emerging growth company" under applicable federal securities laws 
and will be subject to reduced public company reporting 
requirements. Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. 
See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 28 for a discussion of 
information that should be considered in connection with an investment in 
our securities. Investors will not be entitled to protections 
normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. 
Neither the SEC nor any state securities commission has approved or 
disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus 
is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal 
offense.
