Law-Enforcement Typology 
C PS ell IlW1S 
There is still confusion, even among professionals, with regard to the terms child 
molester and pedophile. For many the terms have become synonymous. For them 
the word pedophile is just a fancy term for a child molester. The public, the 
media, and many child-abuse professionals frequently use the terms interchange-
ably and simplistically refer to all those who sexually victimize children as 
pedophiles. There is no single or uniform definition for the word "pedophile." As 
previously stated, for mental-health professionals, it is a psychiatric diagnosis with 
specific criteria. Labeling all child molesters as pedophiles is, however, confusing. 
There are dear differences between the types of individuals who sexually abuse 
children, and law-enforcement officers handling these cases need to understand 
that and make such distinctions when appropriate. 
Not all pedophiles are child molesters. A child molester is an individual who 
sexually molests children. A pedophile might have a sexual preference for chil-
dren and fantasize about having sex with them, but if he does not act on that 
preference or those fantasies, he is not a child molester. Whether or not a person 
acts on deviant sexual fantasies and urges may be influenced by other factors 
such as personality traits, the severity of psychosocial stressors, personal inhibi-
tions, substance abuse, or opportunities. Inhibiting factors such as guilt, moral 
beliefs, or fear of discovery may limit or reduce the sexual activity with children. 
Some pedophiles might act out their fantasies in legal ways by simply talking 
to or watching children and later masturbating. Some might have sex with dolls 
and mannequins that resemble children. Some pedophiles might act out their 
fantasies in legal ways by engaging in sexual activity with adults who look (small 
statured, flat-chested, no body hair), dress (children's underwear, school uniform),
or act (immature, baby talk) like young children. Others may act out child fan-
tasy games with adult prostitutes. A difficult problem to detect and address is that 
of individuals who act out their sexual fantasies by socially interacting with chil-
dren (i.e., in-person or via an online computer), or by interjecting themselves into 
the child-sexual-abuse or exploitation "problem" as overzealous child advocates 
(i.e., cyber vigilantes). It is almost impossible to estimate how many pedophiles 
exist who have never molested a child. What society can or should do with such 
individuals is an interesting area for discussion but beyond the role of inves-
tigators or prosecutors. People cannot be arrested and prosecuted just for 
their fantasies. 
Not all child molesters are pedophiles. A pedophile is an individual who 
prefers to have sex with children. A person who prefers to have sex with an adult 
partner may, for any number of reasons, decide to have sex with a child. Such 
reasons might include simple availability, opportunity, curiosity, or a desire to 
hurt a loved one of the molested child. The erotic imagery and sexual fantasies of 
such individuals are not necessarily recurrent, intense, and focused on children; 
therefore, these people are not pedophiles. 
Are child molesters with adolescent victims pedophiles? Is an individual who 
collects both child and adult pornography a pedophile? Is everyone using a com-
puter to facilitate having sex with children or trafficking in child pornography a 
pedophile? Many child molesters are, in fact, pedophiles, and many pedophiles
