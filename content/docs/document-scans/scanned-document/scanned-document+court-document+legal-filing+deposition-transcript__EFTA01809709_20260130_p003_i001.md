Fiscal, Policy, and Legal Considerations Regarding State Compliance with the Adam Walsh Act 
Page 3 
for SORNA implementation;1U difficulties in determining state and local fiscal impact of SORNA compliance; 
unanswered questions regarding SORNA implementation; and other possible impacts that may result from 
SORNA compliance. 
It has been reported that JAG funding has declined 83.5 percent over the last decade." NCSL staff stated that 
recent federal legislation that Congress passed (S. 23I/H.R. 3546) "continued the existence of the Byme/JAG 
program with an authorization (maximum potential funding) of $1.095 billion, the same authorization from FY 
2006. However, the actual FY 2009 appropriations will still be at the discretion of the appropriations 
committees. While Byrne/JAG could potentially receive 51.095 billion, it is unlikely the program will actually see 
those [kinds] of numbers. Since 2003, the largest amount appropriated to Byrne/JAG was $659 million in 2004. In 
FY 2006, the actual appropriation of Byrne/JAG was $416.5 million and $192 million for Byrne discretionary 
grants. In FY 2007 the appropriated funding for Byrne/JAG increased to $520 million, only to be unexpectedly 
slashed to $170 million in FY 2008"13
The Bureau of Justice Assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice "awards Byrne Program funds through two 
types of grant programs: discretionary and formula."13 FDLE is the State Administering Agency (SAA), which 
means that it administers Florida's Byrne program. The discretionary grant program does not appear to be 
affected by non-compliance with SORNA, so it is not discussed further in this brief. The total JAG allocation to 
Florida in FY08 was $10,054,495, which is a 65 percent decrease ($12,272,118) from the FY07 JAG allocation. 
Forty percent of the $10,054,495 ($4,021,798) is direct awards to units of local government: $3,363,673 for direct 
awards of $10,000 or more and $658,125 for direct awards of less than $10,000 (administered by the state). Sixty 
percent of the $10,054,495 ($6,032,697) consists of the "JAG block award." A percentage of the JAG block 
award is "passed through" (subgrants) to local agencies and the remainder funds state agencies (subject to 
legislative appropriations).1°
FDLE has attempted to project what Florida might receive based on the FY09 federal appropriations legislation. 
Based on the House bill, the total funding award to Florida for FY09 may be 521,670,000. Based on the Senate 
bill, the total funding award for FY09 may be $22,852,000.15 Florida may lose $2,167,000 (House bill) or 
$2,852,000 (Senate bill) in JAG funding based on the application of the 10 percent JAG funding reduction penalty 
to the projected FY09 JAG allocation to Florida, if information received by FDLE staff from SMART office staff 
is correct that the 10 percent JAG funding reduction penalty only affects the JAG block award (60% of Florida's 
total JAG allocation) and the local direct awards of less than $10,000 (a portion of the remaining 40% of Florida's 
total JAG allocation). 
10 Grams may reduce some of the fiscal impact of SORNA on some state and local agencies. Congress has not funded the Sex 
Offender Management Assistance program or the bonus payments for prompt compliance with SORNA that were authorized 
by the AWA, but $11.8 million in grants and assistance were made available in 2008 through the Adam Walsh 
Implementation Grant Program. Innovations proposed by states and accepted by the SMART office may also reduce some 
fiscal impact. For example, FDLE has proposed to the SMART office the concept of using a secure online/by phone self-
report rather than having to show up at a sheriff's office "in person" to register employment and secondary school 
information.

14 Information regarding JAG funding allocations to Florida and the fiscal impact on state agencies of legislation 
implementing SORNA was compiled from various documents and fiscal analyses provided by FDLE, the Department of 
Corrections, and the Department of Juvenile Justice. 
13 According to FDLE. the 51.095 billion is the maximum that Congress could appropriate. The Senate bill appropriated $580 
million and the House bill appropriated $550 million. FDLE estimated the amount of FY09 JAG funds in the Senate bill by 
taking the amount in the FY09 JAG funds ($580 million) passed by Senate Appropriation Committee and multiplying it by 
3.94% [(56,690,822, which is the FY08 JAG block award plus state-administered grants of less than $10,000 to local 
governmental entities, divided by the total amount of FY08 JAG funds appropriated by Congress ($170 million)]. FDLE 
estimated the amount of FY09 JAG funds in the House bill by taking the amount in the FY09 JAG funds ($550 million) 
passed by House Appropriation Committee and multiplying it by 3.94%.
