In the real world, each of the paraphilias typically has: 1) slang names (e.g., big baby, golden 
showers, S&M), 2) an industry that sells related paraphernalia and props (e.g., restraining devices, 
gags, adult size baby clothing), 3) a support network (e.g., North American► Man/Boy Love 
Association or NAMBLA, Diaper Pail Fraternity), and 4) a body of literature (i.e., pornography). 
In fact, the paraphilias are the organizational framework or the "Dewey Decimal System" of 
pornography, obscenity, adult bookstores, and Internet sex chat rooms. 
Paraphilias are psychosexual disorders and not types of sex crimes. They may or may not involve 
criminal activity. Individuals suffering from one or more of these paraphilias can just engage in 
fantasy and masturbate, or they can act out their fantasies legally (e.g., consenting adult partners, 
' objects), or they can act out their fantasies illegally 
nonconsenting partners, underage 
partners). It is their choice. 
Although any of the paraphilias could become elements of a computer child sexual exploitation 
case,'Pedophilia is the most obvious and the one best known to prosecutors dealing with these 
cases. It is important for prosecutors to understand that the diagnostic criteria for Pedophilia 
require that there be recurrent, intense, and sexually arousing fantasies, urges or behaviors 
involving prepubescent children, generally age 13 or younger. The absence of any of the key 
criteria could eliminate the diagnosis. For example, an individual with a strong preference for and 
repeatedly engaging in sex with large numbers of 14-year-olds could correctly be evaluated by a 
mental health professional as NOT a pedophile. In spite of this, some mental health professionals 
continue to apply the term to those with a sexual preference for pubescent teenagers. 
The terms Hebephilia and Ephebophilia are not specifically mentioned in the DSM-IV-TR, and 
are rarely used, even by mental health. professionals. They are, however, being increasingly used 
in forensic evaluations submitted to the court by defendants attempting to minimize their sexual 
behavior. Although sexual attraction to pubescent children by adults has the obvious potential for 
criminal activity, it does not necessarily constitute a sexual perversion as defined by psychiatry. 
On an investigative level, the presence of paraphilias often means highly repetitive and 
• 
predictable behavior;focused on specific sexual interests, that goes well beyond a "method of 
operation" (MO). The concept of an MO—something done by an offender because it works and 
will help him get away with the crime—is well !mown to most investigators. An MO is fueled by 
thought and deliberation. Most offenders change and improve their MO over time and with 
experience. 
The repetitive behavior patterns of some sex offenders can and do involve some MO, but are 
more likely to also involve the less-known concept of sexual ritual. Sexual ritual is the repeated 
engaging in an act or series of acts in a certain manner.because of a sexual need; that is, in order 
to become aroused and/or gratified, a person must engage in the act in a certain way. Some 
aspects of the MO of sex offenders can, if repeated often enough during sexual activity, become 
part of the sexual ritual. Other types of ritual behavior can be motivated by psychological, 
cultural, or spiritual needs. Unlike an MO, ritual is necessary to the offender but not to the 
successful commission of the crime. In fact, instead of facilitating the crime, ritual often 
increases the odds of identification, apprehension, and conviction because it causes the offender 
to make need-driven mistakes.
