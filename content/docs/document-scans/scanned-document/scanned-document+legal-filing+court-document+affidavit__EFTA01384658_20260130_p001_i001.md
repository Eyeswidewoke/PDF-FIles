Convertible arbitrage strategies, an example of a relative value strategy which is employed 
by an Underlying Fund, consists of buying, selling and trading convertible securities, typically 
including hedging a portion of the risk inherent in such Securities. Convertible securities are 
Securities that may be exchanged or converted into a predetermined number of an issuer's 
underlying common shares at the option of the holder during a specified time period. They may 
take the form of convertible preferred stock, convertible bonds or debentures, stock purchase 
warrants or other securities combining the features of these Securities. Convertible hedging 
combines the use of other instruments in conjunction with a convertible security with a view to 
controlling risk while seeking profits. Convertible securities may be hedged by selling short some 
or all of the common stock issuable upon conversion of such Securities, or by establishing 
"synthetic" short positions through derivatives and options transactions. If the market price of the 
common stock increases above the conversion price on a convertible security, the price of such 
convertible security should increase. If the price of the common stock declines, the price of the 
corresponding convertible security should decline. 
The Management Company will employ a variety of convertible arbitrage trading and 
investment strategies for an Underlying Fund. The primary objective of such trading is to profit 
from mispricings and anomalies between and among the various instruments traded, seeking to 
exploit a relatively small perceived spread on any given trade. The successful identification of 
mispriced Securities and contracts requires expertise in assessing the relative values of different 
but related instruments. 
The value of a Security is influenced by a number of characteristics, including credit 
quality, volatility, liquidity and "borrowability," as well as "corporate event" risk (e.g, change of 
control transactions). In order to mitigate these risks, the Management Company utilizes 
fundamental credit research along with quantitative analysis and modeling in making investments 
with regard to the equity and fixed income components of any particular investment. 
Market Neutral and Hedged Strategies 
Although the Management Company invests in positions that are intended to be market 
neutral, it may be unable to, or decide not to, hedge its positions, and, in such event, an Underlying 
Fund might sustain a significant risk of loss as a result of changes in the price of unhedged 
positions. In addition, there is no guarantee that the returns of the Underlying Fund will continue 
to have a low correlation or be non-correlated with market indices and the Underlying Fund could 
experience significant losses. This may be particularly true during periods of very high market 
volatility resulting from global events such as political upheavals, terrorist attacks, war or 
government intervention in currency markets. 
An Underlying Fund also may utilize financial instruments such as commodity interests, 
forward contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and floors both for investment purposes and to seek 
to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of the Underlying Funds' portfolio positions. 
Hedging against a decline in the value of a portfolio position does not eliminate fluctuations in the 
values of portfolio positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline, but establishes 
other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thus moderating the decline in the 
portfolio positions' value. Such hedge transactions also limit the opportunity for gain if the value 
of the portfolio positions should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible for the Underlying
