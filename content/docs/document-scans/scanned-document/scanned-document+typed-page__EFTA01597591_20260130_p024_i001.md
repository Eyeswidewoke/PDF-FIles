Statement for more detailed information regarding the program and FDIC insurance. 
Available cash balances will be deposited in Bank USA up to a "sweep cap' which is generally 
$250,000 per owner per Account. Available ash balances in excess of the sweep cap will be 
deposited in deposit accounts at AG Stamford Branch as a Secondary Sweep Option unless you 
select a different Secondary Sweep Option, if available. Funds in deposit accounts at AG 
Stamford Branch are not eligible for FDIC insurance or protection by SIPC or any other 
government agency. Sweep Funds are not FDIC-insured, not guaranteed by a bank, 
are sold by prospectus only and may lose value. 
If your Account is not eligible to sweep to deposit accounts at AG Stamford Branch, your 
Secondary Sweep Option will be a Sweep Fund. Sweep Funds are not available to non-U.S. 
residents. The Secondary Sweep Options for certain Investment Advisory Accounts will differ. 
Please refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement. 
You may change your Secondary Sweep Option to an available alternative Secondary Sweep 
Option at any time by contacting your Financial Advisor. By instructing us to change your 
Secondary Sweep Option, you are authorizing and directing us to redeem your Sweep Fund 
shares, or withdraw funds from the deposit accounts at AG Stamford Branch and transfer the 
funds to your new Secondary Sweep Option. 
Accounts that are not eligible for the UBS Bank Sweep Programs may be eligible to have 
available ash balances swept to deposit accounts through the UBS FDIC-Insured Deposit 
Program, a Sweep Fund or to other Sweep Options that we may make available from time to 
time (subject to eligibility requirements). 
UBS FDIC-Insured Deposit Program 
Accounts owned by a revocable or irrevocable trust are eligible for the UBS FDIC-Insured 
Deposit Program as long as no trust beneficiary is a for-profit business entity. Through this 
program, available cash balances are swept to deposit accounts at participating banks -- up to 
$249,000 at each participating bank. Bank USA is a participating bank. Deposits are insured by 
the FDIC up to applicable limits and subject to FDIC rules. You are responsible for monitoring 
the total amount of deposits to determine the extent of FDIC deposit insurance coverage 
available to you. The program is more fully described in the UBS FDIC-Insured Disclosure 
Statement, which is part of the Agreements and Disclosures booklet and also available at 
www.ubs.corraccountdisclosures.
