Item 8: Methods of Analysis, Investment Strategies and Risk of Loss 
Underlying Fund Manager/Sub-Adviser Selection: 
The Private Access Funds' primary investment objective will be to allow investors to gain 
exposure to select fund managers at significantly lower investment minimums than would be 
required for a direct investment in any Underlying Fund. iCapital will accomplish this by 
leveraging our sourcing advantages and employing an ongoing "bottom-up" diligence approach. 
The Direct Investment Funds' investment objective is to provide its investors access to 
portfolio management by a variety of Sub-Advisers selected by iCapital. 
Bottom-up Diligence (Private Equity Funds): 
iCapital's due diligence team is focused on conducting investment, operations, and legal due 
diligence on the Private Access Fund offerings made available on iCapital's platform. iCapital's 
due diligence process comprises three stages. In the initial quantitative phase of evaluation, 
iCapital reviews the forward calendar of funds coming to market to develop market maps 
across the various private equity strategies (buyouts. growth capital. mezzanine. etc.) to 
identify funds likely to be appealing to iCapital's network. At this stage. iCapital also identifies 
fundraising schedules and targets and compares performance against benchmarks and against 
specific managers in the pipeline. 
Once iCapital has isolated funds coming to market in the ensuing 18 months. iCapital proceeds 
to the second phase of the due diligence process. During this phase. iCapital conducts a 
comprehensive evaluation of the manager's track record, a detailed benchmarking analysis. and 
a thorough review of the competitive landscape. iCapital has an initial meeting with the 
investment team and seeks to analyze the fund's investment strategy. review the quality and 
competency of the investment team, and understand the market outlook. Before meeting with 
a manager. iCapital's diligence team spends a significant amount of time evaluating data room 
materials provided by the manager. They prepare an agenda with a thorough list of questions. 
Also, during this phase of diligence. iCapital does a complete review of the fund's PPM. LPA. 
and ancillary marketing materials. Finally. iCapital makes reference calls to understand market 
positioning, team stability and depth. and market demand. 
iCapital's due diligence comprises both qualitative and quantitative components. The qualitative 
manager assessment generally includes a full-day onsite during which iCapital meets with the 
manager's investment. operational, and legal professionals. iCapital aims to cover many 
different topics during these meetings, including team depth and stability, investment strategy 
and marketing positioning. competitive landscape. discussion of poor investments and lessons 
learned. iCapital leverages these meetings, the review of the managers' due diligence 
questionnaire, and responses to any additional questions. to evaluate the fund relative to its 
peers with a focus on assessing the team in the context of its depth, diversity, and longevity. 
iCapital assesses the manager's compensation structure to ensure alignment of interest. 
iCapital conducts both on the list and off the list reference calls to contacts including 
executives at portfolio companies. peer firms, institutional LPs, former employees, and service 
providers such as bankers and lawyers. 
iCapital's quantitative analysis is focused on performing a comprehensive track record
