MARGIN DISCLOSURE 
IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS MARGIN DISCLOSURE PRIOR TO OPENING A MARGIN ACCOUNT AND 
RETAIN A C( 'Y FOR YCY IR RECCRO£ 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (DBSI) is furnishing this document to you, the Client, to provide some basic facts about 
purchasing securities on margin, end to alert you to the risks involved with trading securities in a margin account. Before 
trading in securities in a margin account, please review this Margin Disclosure carefully (which is to be read in 
conjunction with the entire Account Agreement). Please call your Client Advisor with any questions or concerns 
regarding the use of margin. 
When you pinches° securities, you may pay for the securities in full or yeti may morrow pert of the pint:nese price from 
DBSI (via a margin loan offered by Pershing). You may also borrow for purposes othor than the ourchase of securities 
based on the value of fully paid securities held in the Account. If you choose to borrow funds from DB51, you must open 
a margin aocoum and sign the attached Margin Agreement along with the Account Agreement. If the securities in your 
account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, DBSI can take action, 
such as issuing a margin call and/or selling securities or other assets in any of your accounts (as provided in the Margin 
Agreement) in orour to maintain the required equity in the account. 
It is important to fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following: 
1. 
You can lose more funds than you deposit in the Margin Account. A decline in the value of securities that are 
purchased on margin may require you to provide additional funds to DB51 to avoid the forced sale of those 
securities or other securities orassets in your accountie). 
2. DBSI can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). If the equity in your account falls below 
the maintenance margin requirements, or OBSI's higher 'house requirements, DBSI can sell the securities or other 
assets in any of your accounts held at DBSLie cover thernargin deficiency. You elso will be responsible for any 
shortfall in the account alter such s sale, including costs and interest accrued. 
3. DBSI can sell your securities or other assets whhout contacting you. Some investors mistakenly believe that a 
firm must contact them for a margin call to be valid, and that the firm cannot liquidate securities or other assets in 
their accounts to meet the call unless the firm has contacted them first. This is not the case. Generally, DBSI does 
attempt to notify its Clients of margin calls, but it is not required to do so. However, even if OBS! has contacted a 
Client and provided a specific date by which the Client can meet a margin call, DBSI can still take necessary steps to 
protect its financial interests. including immediately selling the securities without notice to the Client. 
4. You are not entitled to choose which securities or ether assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a 
margin call. Because the securities are collateral for the margin loan, 0651 has the right to decide which security to 
sell in order to protect its interests. 
5. 
DBSI can increase its 'howls' maintenance reergin mquirements at any time and is net Tottered to provide you 
advance written notice. These changes in firm policy often take effect immediately and may result in the issuance 
of a maintenance margin call. Your failure to satisfy the call may cause DBSI to liquidate or sell securities in 
your account(s). 
6. You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. Whys an extension of time to meet margin 
requirements may be available to clients under certain conditions, a client does not have a right to the extension. 
7. 
Short Sales are margin tiansactions and ievolve the risks deticrihed above. A short sale means any sale of 
securities that you do not own or which are borrowed for your account ('Short Sales"). Because short aides are 
margin transactions, such transactions are subject to the same risks and terms and conditions of margin transactions. 
8. DBSI and/or Pershing may loan any securities which collateralize your margin loan. Securities held in a margin 
account may he lent, to 08SI, to Pershing or to others, and may be pledged, repledged, hypotheemed or 
rehypothecated by DB51 and/or Pershing, without notice to you. ()BSI and/or Pershing may do so without retaining 
in its possession or control for delivery a like amount of. similar Securities and Other Property and in doing so. are 
authorized to retain eertein benefits. including nurse' on your collateral posted for ouch loons. While year securities 
are loaned out, you will lose voting rights attendant to such securities. Pershing and/or DBSI may receive 
compensation in contectioo with these transactions. Fnr additional information on rehypetdeeation, please refer tb
