als—that changed society. There is still 
much to be learned about molecules, 
bonds. and reactivity, but these subjects 
seem of a different character than aging. 
machine intelligence, and privacy—
more evolutionary than revolutionary. 
Are the revolutionary discoveries now 
elsewhere, or are there still chemical 
discoveries as profound as the laws of 
thermodynamics. the nature of the 
chemical bond, and the molecular basis 
of inheritance waiting to be made? 
Any answers to this question hinge 
on personal opinion, and on the defini-
tion of "chemistry". Is it profound to 
understand the origin of life, or the 
nature of sentience? It is, to me. Are 
these subjects "chemistry"? They are, to 
me. Is it profound to understand com-
plexity (whatever "complexity" means), 
or to develop nonliving intelligence? 
Yes, and both have important chemical 
components. Is it profound to hybridize 
living and nonliving systems? Of course, 
and chemistry offers much to the effort. 
This Essay is about the assumptions 
that our society accepts and the poten-
tial of science to sweep aside these 
assumptions. It is not specifically about 
chemistry. However. I am a chemist, and 
I believe that chemistry can be every-
where, if chemists so choose, or that it 
can contract into an invisible part of the 
infrastructure of technology, if they 
don't. Chemistry, by its culture, has been 
almost blindly reductionist. I am repeat-
edly reminded that "Chemists work on 
molecules", as if to do anything else 
were suspect. Chemists do and should 
work on molecules, but also on the uses 
of molecules, and on problems of which 
molecules may be only a pan of the 
solution. If chemists move beyond mol-
ecules to learn the entire problem—from 
design of surfactants, to synthesis of 
colloids. to MRI contrast agents. to the 
trajectories of cells in the embryo, to the 
applications of regenerative medicine—
then the flow of ideas problems. and 
solutions between chemistry and society 
will animate both. 
As a technology, chemistry has built 
the foundation from which many of the 
discoveries of "biology", or "microelec-
tronics", or "brain science" (or "plane-
tary exploration", for that matter) have 
grown. There would be no genomics 
without chemical methods for separat-
ing fragments of DNA, and for synthe-
sizing primers and probes, and for 
separating restriction endonucleases in-
to pure activities. There would be no 
nuclear ICBMs without methods of 
refining plutonium and uranium, and 
making explosive lenses. There would 
be no drugs without synthesis and mass 
spectrometry. There would be no inter-
planetary probes without fuels, and 
carbon/carbon rocket throat nozzles, 
and silicon single crystals. 
Those arc the past. What about the 
future? Chemistry is, still. everywhere: 
It nuts: be! It is the science of the real 
world. But, to remain a star in the play 
rather than a stagehand. it must open its 
eyes to new problems. It is impossible 
that the human life span will increase 
dramatically without manipulation of 
the molecules of the human organism. 
but understanding this problem will 
require more than manipulating mole-
cules. Communication between the liv-
ing and nonliving will also require 
engineering a molecular interface be-
tween them, but designing this interface 
will require understanding the nature of 
"information" in organisms and in com-
puters, and how to translate between 
them. A society that uses information 
technology to interweave all its parts 
requires new systems for generating, 
distributing, and storing power, but 
batteries will be only one part of these 
systems. 
Chemistry has always been the in-
visible hand that builds and operates the 
tools, and sustains the infrastructure. It 
can be more. We think of ourselves as 
experts in quarrying blocks from gran-
ite; we have not thought it our job to 
build cathedrals from them. Whether we 
choose to focus on the molecules, mate-
rials, and tools that are at the beginnings 
of discovery, or bring our particular, 
unique understanding of the world to 
bear on unraveling the problems at the 
end, is for us to decide. 
I believe that everything from meth-
ane to sentience is chemistry, and that 
we should reexamine our own assump-
tions concerning the boundaries of our 
field. Examining the broader assump-
tions that follow may provide some 
stimulus to do so.

Assumptions 
I. We Are Mortal 
We assume we are mortal: we will 
die. We know that from experience, 
albeit the experience of others. But die 
of what? One hundred years ago, infec-
tious disease was a major cause of death; 
now, it is a relatively minor problem. 
Most of us now alive will die of cardio-
vascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's dis-
ease. diabetes degenerative disease. Re-
gardless of the details, we die of old age. 
We know, however, that some cells 
age differently than others. Transformed 
cells are in some sense immortal (al-
though they are not an organism); 
single-celled organisms that replicate 
by division have a kind of immortality. 
There are strategies that strongly pro-
long life: caloric deprivation does so in 
mice and fruit flies, and probably also 
does so in man. Inheritance certainly 
makes a difference. 
Molecular biology has begun to 
illuminate each of our infirmities and 
to suggest remedies. Cardiovascular 
(CV) disease is already following the 
path of infectious disease: the combina-
tion of medications that control blood 
pressure, and others (HMGA-CoA re-
duettist inhibitors; aspirin) that control 
cholesterol concentrations and the clot-
ting of blood is decreasing mortality as a 
result of CV disease; these benefits will 
increase when treatment begins earlier 
in life, before the damage is done. 
Understanding the role of free radicals 
in damage to tissues can help to limit 
injury after blockage to a blood supply. 
Infectious disease may also play an 
important role in the damage to the 
intima of the blood vessels, and help to 
initiate plaque formation. Changes in 
lifestyle—eating less fat and red meat. 
smoking fewer cigarettes—contribute to 
limiting injury. Many of the causes of 
CV disease seem understandable, and. 
in principle, controllable. Minimize 
these causes, and when these medical 
strategies finally fail, replace the dys-
functional organ with one from a pig 
engineered immunologically to resem-
ble a human, or regenerate the organ 
entirely. There seems a realistic possi-
bility that CV disease—now the largest 
single cause of death—may cease to be a 
significant contributor to mortality.
