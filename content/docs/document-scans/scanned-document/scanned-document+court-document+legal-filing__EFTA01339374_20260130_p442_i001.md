Regulations (the "EAR") (collectively, the "Aircraft Documentation"). 
The Airframe, 
Engines, Blades, Aircraft Components and Aircraft Documentation are collectively

Seller shall be entitled to redact from the Aircraft Documentation) Seller's confidential 
flight information, internal confidential or proprietary information unrelated to the 
operational control, condition or maintenance of the Aircraft including, without 
limitation, its passenger manifests, pilot assignments, non-business personal use tracking,

substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Assignment of Warranties") and 
cooperate with Buyer to cause to be transferred and assigned to Buyer any and all 
warranties relating to the Aircraft to the extent such warranties are still in effect and 
transferrable. If any consent of an applicable warranty provider is required for any such 
warranty to be assigned, Seller agrees to take such other reasonable steps, at Buyer's 
request and at Buyer's expense, as will enable Buyer to receive the benefit of the assigned 
warranties and to process warranty claims directly with such warranty provider. 
1.2.2 Service Contracts. 
Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall 
cooperate with Buyer to cause to be transferred and assigned to Buyer any and all of 
Seller's rights with respect to any and all repair or maintenance agreements or programs

include without limitation, any subscriptions maintained by Seller to any computerized 
maintenance programs and any maintenance service programs or other similar agreements 
as applicable, including, without limitation, the contracts described on Schedule 1.2.2 
(collectively, "Service Contracts"). Seller shall be responsible for and shall have paid any 
and all sums owing to providers of Service Contracts with respect to all periods prior to 
the Closing. Buyer shall be responsible for and shall pay any fees associated with the 
transfer or assignment of such Service Contracts. Buyer, at its election, may terminate 
any Service Contracts after the Closing or choose not to have any Service Contract 
transferred or assigned. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer to obtain acceptance and 
acknowledgement by the provider of each such Service Contract of the transfer or 
assignment of each such Service Contract.
