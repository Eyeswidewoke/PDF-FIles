models pretending to be underage children and "virtual" child pornography that 
is created with computer software that does not involve the depiction of actual 
children. 
The ability to manipulate digital visual images with a computer can make it 
more difficult to determine the ages of the persons in them. Computer-manipu-
lated and, soon, computer-generated visual images of individuals who appear to 
be, but are not, children engaging in sexually explicit conduct may call into 
question the basis for highly restrictive (i.e., possession, advertising) child-
_pornography laws. In an attempt to deal with this problem, the Child 
Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) of 1996, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2252A, expanded 
the federal definition of "child pornography" to include not only a sexually 
explicit visual depiction using a minor, but also any visual depiction that "has 
been created, adapted, or modified to appear (emphasis added) that an identifi-
able minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct." This expanded definition, in 
essence, federally criminalizes simulated child pornography. Although this new 
law makes prosecution of cases involving manipulated computer images easier, it 
also means that it is no longer possible in every case to argue that child pornogra-
phy is the permanent record of the abuse or exploitation of an actual child. The 
significance of being able to make that argument will be discussed shortly. This 
law is currently being challenged in a variety of cases and jurisdictions, and the 
U.S. Supreme .Court will ultimately establish its constitutionality. If this law is 
found unconstitutional, only existing obscenity laws may apply to such 
manipulated/simulated child pornography. 
With other than simulated and/or virtual child pornography, it could be effec-
tively argued that• child pornography requires a child to be victimized. A child 
had to be sexually exploited to produce the material. Children used in pornogra-
phy are desensitized and conditioned to respond as sexual objects. They are 
frequently ashamed of their portrayal in such material. They must deal with the 
permanency, longevity, and circulation of such a record of their sexual 
victimization. Some types of sexual activity can be repressed and hidden from 
public knowledge. When this happens child victims can imagine that some day 
the activity will be over, and they can make a fresh start. Many children, espe-
cially adolescent boys, vehemently deny their involvement with a pedophile. But 
there is no denying or hiding from a sexually explicit photograph or videotape. 
The child in a photograph or videotape is young forever, and the material can be 
used over and over again for years. Some children have even committed crimes 
in attempts to retrieve or destroy the permanent records of their molestation. The 
fact that none of these points can be argued about simulated child pornography 
greatly weakens the jury and sentencing appeal of cases prosecuted under that 
portion of the 1996 CPPA.

In addition to theme pornography, preferential sex offenders are also highly likely 
to collect other paraphernalia related to their sexual interests. Focusing on child 
molesters, in the early 1980s I started calling this other material "child erotica." In 
Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis (fanning, 1986), I defined it as "any mate-
rial, relating to children, that serves a sexual purpose for a given individual." It is 
'a broader, more encompassing, and more subjective term than child pornogra-
phy. It includes things such as fantasy writings, letters, diaries, books, sexual aids,
