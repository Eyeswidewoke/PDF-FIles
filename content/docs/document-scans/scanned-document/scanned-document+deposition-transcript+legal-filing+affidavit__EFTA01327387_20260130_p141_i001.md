each insured, (v) waive any right of set-off against Agent and/or Lenders, and any rights of subrogation 
against Agent and/or Lenders, (vi) provide that in respect of the interests of Agent and Lenders in such 
policies, that the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of Borrower or any other 
Person operating or in possession of the Aircraft, regardless of any breach or violation of any warranties, 
declarations or conditions contained in such policies by or binding upon Borrower or any other Person 
operating or in possession of the Aircraft, and (vii) be primary, not subject to any co-insurance clause and 
shall be without right of contribution from any other insurance. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of the 
preceding sentence, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists and no Event of Loss with 
respect to the Aircraft has occurred, any amount payable to Agent pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be 
paid if (A) $200,000.00, or more, in the aggregate, to Agent and Borrower, jointly, as their interests may 
appear, and released by Agent to Borrower or other appropriate Persons in payment of the costs actually 
incurred with respect to repairs made to the Aircraft so as to restore it to the operating condition required 
by this Agreement, or shall be disbursed by Agent as otherwise required by this Agreement, or (B) less 
than $200,000.00 in the aggregate, to Borrower (and such amounts shall be applied by Borrower to pay 
the costs of such repairs). Borrower shall consult with Agent prior to agreeing to any settlement or 
adjustment of any claim in respect of damage, repair or other loss to the Aircraft, including, without 
limitation, the Airframe, Engines and any Part, where the cost of replacement or fair market value of the 
damage, repair or other loss to the Aircraft, including, without limitation, the Airframe, Engines and any 
Part, is in excess of 8200,000.00. 
(c) All of the coverages required herein shall be in full force and effect worldwide throughout 
any geographical areas to, in or over which the Aircraft is operated. Borrower shall not self-insure (by 
deductible, premium adjustment or risk retention arrangement of any kind) the insurance required to be 
maintained hereunder. All insurance proceeds payable under the requisite policies shall be payable in U.S. 
Dollars. Borrower agrees that it shall obtain and maintain such other insurance coverages, or cause 
adjustments to be made to the scope, amount or other aspects of the existing insurance coverages, as 
promptly as practicable upon Agent's request, as and when Agent, in the exercise of its good faith credit 
discretion, deems such additional insurance coverages or modifications to be appropriate in light of any 
changes in Applicable Standards, the insurance market, Borrower's anticipated use of the Aircraft or other 
pertinent circumstances. 
(d) 
Annually on or before the anniversary of the policy expiration date, Borrower shall furnish to 
Agent evidence of insurance coverage in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent evidencing 
that Borrower has obtained the insurance coverages required herein for a twelve (12) month or greater period 
commencing from and after such anniversary date, and, if Agent shall so request, a copy of the applicable 
policies. In the event Borrower shall fail to maintain insurance as herein provided. Agent and/or Lenders 
may, at their option, provide such insurance, and Borrower shall, upon demand, reimburse Agent and/or 
Lenders for the cost thereof, together with interest at the highest default rate of interest provided for in the 
Loan Documents from the date of payment through the date of reimbursement

Borrower shall notify Agent of any such Event of Loss within five (5) Business Days of the date thereof. 
Borrower shall pay Agent, within forty-five (45) days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, in 
immediately available funds the greater of (i) all insurance proceeds received by Borrower in connection with 
such Event of Loss, and (ii) the Minimum Payment set forth on Annex G hereto corresponding to the month 
in which such payment occurs, together with any principal installment then due and payable under the 
Obligations and all interest accrued on the Obligations through the date of payment to Agent, first, to be 
applied to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations in such order and manner as Agent may 
elect, and second, any excess remaining after such application, to be disbursed to Borrower, and (y) if the 
unpaid principal balance of any of the Notes is reduced by such Minimum Payment, the principal 
installments set forth in Exhibit A to such Note shall be deemed amended from and after the payment date 
immediately following the sale date to reflect the amortization of the then unpaid principal balance of such 
Note over the remaining payment dates as determined by Agent in its sole discretion. Upon indefeasible 
payment in full of such amounts and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
