Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which could 
include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance 
of the lease term. Our obligation to continue making rental payments and 
fulfilling other lease obligations under leases for closed or unopened 
restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results 
of operations. In addition, lease rates in Brazil are typically readjusted 
every three years and the rent amounts are not predetermined as they are in 
the United States. If the landlord and we cannot agree on an adjusted 
rate, the dispute is submitted to a judicial resolution process. As a 
result, our lease rates in Brazil are subject to more volatility than those 
in the 
United States and we may not always be able to predict these rates due to 
the unpredictable nature of the judicial resolution process, which could be 
unfavorable to us. 
At the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant, we may 
be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, 
if at all. If we are unable to renew our restaurant leases, we may be forced 
to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to significant 
construction and other costs. For example, closing a restaurant, even for a 
brief period to permit relocation, would reduce the revenue contribution 
of that restaurant to our total revenue. Additionally, the revenue and 
profit, if any, generated at a relocated restaurant may not equal the 
revenue and 
profit generated at the previous restaurant location. 
Long-term leases can, however, limit our flexibility to move a restaurant to 
a new location. For example, current locations may no longer be 
attractive in the event that demographic patterns shift or neighborhood 
conditions decline. In addition, long-term leases may affect our ability to 
take advantage of more favorable rent levels due to changes in local real 
estate market conditions. These and other location-related issues may 
affect the financial performance of individual restaurants. 
Our rent expense could increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and 
industry conditions and could limit our operating and 
financial flexibility. 
Our rent expense accounted for approximately 7.1% of our revenue in 2013, 
6.4% in 2014 and 6.8% in the thirteen weeks ended March 29, 
2015. We expect that new restaurants will typically be leased by us under 
operating leases. Substantial operating lease obligations could have 
significant negative consequences, including: 
• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; 
• requiring a substantial portion of our available cash to be applied to pay 
our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other 
purposes; 
• limiting our ability to obtain any necessary financing; and 
• limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our 
business or our industry. 
We depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease obligations and to 
fulfill our other cash requirements. If our restaurants do not 
generate sufficient cash flow and sufficient funds are not otherwise
