MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect 
our plans, estimates and beliefs. Such statements involve risks 
and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those 
discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, 
including those set forth in "Risk Factors" and "Special Note Regarding 
Forward-Looking Statements." The following discussion of our financial 
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our 
consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere 
in this prospectus, as well as the information presented under "Prospectus 
Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial Data" and "Selected 
Consolidated Financial Data." All references to years, unless otherwise 
noted, refer to our fiscal years, which end on December 31. 
Overview 
We are the fastest growing major pet food company in the United States, 
selling dog and cat food made with whole meats, fruits and 
vegetables, and other high-quality, natural ingredients. BLUE is a billion 
dollar brand based on sales at retail and is the #1 brand in the Wholesome 
Natural market segment. We develop, produce, market and sell pet food under 
our four major product lines: BLUE Life Protection Formula, BLUE 
Wilderness, BLUE Basics and BLUE Freedom. Each line of pet food includes 
different product types for dogs and cats, such as dry food, wet food 
and treats. We also produce and sell cat litter products under the BLUE 
Naturally Fresh line. While we have only one reporting segment, for 
purposes of discussing our net sales we categorize our products as (1) Dry 
Foods or (2) Wet Foods, Treats and Other Products. Dry Foods 
contributed approximately 81% of our net sales for 2014 compared to 82% of 
our net sales for 2013, with the remaining 19% and 18% for 2014 
and 2013, respectively, attributable to Wet Foods, Treats and Other Products. 
We sell our products in the specialty channels, either directly to retailers 
or through distributors. The specialty channels include national 
pet superstore chains, regional pet store chains, neighborhood pet stores, 
veterinary clinics, farm and feed stores, eCommerce retailers, military 
outlets and hardware stores. BLUE is sold across all types of specialty 
retailers in the United States and Canada, although our sales in the Vet 
channel are currently minimal. Our products were first sold in national pet 
superstores and a significant majority of our net sales is still generated 
from national pet superstores, PetSmart and Petco, which are our top two 
customers. Over the last three years, we have continued to diversify our 
customer base, with 74% of our net sales generated from national pet 
superstores in 2014 as compared to 78% in 2012. We expect our net sales to 
accounts outside of national pet superstores to continue to grow faster as 
we make BLUE more widely available across different specialty channels. 
Our products are manufactured in the United States through a hybrid network 
of owned and contracted manufacturing facilities and 
distributed from owned and contracted distribution centers. In September 
2014, we commenced manufacturing operations at our Heartland facility 
in Joplin, Missouri. Once our Heartland facility ramps up to capacity, which
