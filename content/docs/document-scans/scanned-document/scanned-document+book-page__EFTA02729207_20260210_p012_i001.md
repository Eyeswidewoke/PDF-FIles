And thea he responds in their sak. Jeffrey

One case is redier more serious. Currendy, 
Citibank is sving Epstein for defaulting on 
loens from ise pfivete-banking arm for 520 
million: Epstein claims that Ciáhank
&ent induced" him into borrowing the 
money kr investments. Citibank disputes this 
charge. 
Tbc legal papers fa eraan case offer a 
are window into Epstein's finanes. In 1995, 
Epstein stopped pains rent to his landlord, 
ts nonprofit Munisipal Arts Society, for his 
dB* in the Yillard House. He daimed that

ot lening his staff in at night. The case was 
centually saded Howeven one of the papers 
(led in this dispute is Epsteint firarsval state-
aent for 1988. in which he claimed to be 
sones 520 million. He listed that he mened

lome in Palm Beach), and 511 million in 
aber assets. ineluding his investment in 
Rddell. A co-investor in Riddell sas: "The 
company had been bought with a huge 
anount of dek. and ir want public. to it 
Yes meaninglas Eo :mach a fleurt like that to 
the priee it tost was about 51.2 mil-
Iiin" The co-investors bought out Epstein's

Epstein has etplained that tau was because

being sued by Wenkt One of the intresten

E
ilsteins appointment to the baard of 
New York's Rockefeller University in 
2000 brought him into &stater sosial promi-
nente. Boasting such social names as Nancy 
Kissinger. Snak Astor, and Robert Bass. 
the board 3150 includes such pre-eminent 
scientists as Nobel laureete Joseph Gold-
stein. "Epstein was thtilled to be elected," 
sa» someone who knot» him. 
After one term Epstein resigned. Accord-
ing to New York magazine, dik was because 
he didn't like to waar a snit to meetings. A 
..nkespetton to- the Rock/StIler board says 
was "arrogant" and "not a good fit:' The 
spokesperson adrnits that it is "infrequent" 
for board members not to be renominated 
after neb one term. 
Stilt, the recent spare of publicity Ep-
stein hes inspired does not stem to have 
rand him. In November he was sponed in 
the front row of the Vietabis Secret fashion 
show at New York's Laingron Avenue Ar-
mory; around the same time the usual co-
terie of friends and beatnik' women ware 
whisked off to Link St. James (which he 
tell: papte has been reneed Link Stiel!) 
for a long weekend.

Dynamiek and Epstein will have an office 
at the university. The program will be &dit 
cated to searching tbr naturis algorithms, a 
pursuit that is a specials). of Nowak's. For 
Epstein this must be the stamras of eren-

Ter these is something almost programmed 
about his retention: it's as if even plee-

improvement. Nowak sas Mat. when he
