1929-30 At age sixty-six, the wealthy American industrialist Solomon R.Guggenheim 
begins to form a large collection of important modern paintings by artists such as Vasily 
Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Marc Chagall. He is guided in this pursuit by a young German 
artist and theorist, Hilla Rebay (born Baroness Mika Rebay von Ehrenwiesen). In July 
1930, Rebay brings Guggenheim to Vasily Kandinsky's Dessau studio, and Guggenheim 
purchases several of the artist's paintings and works on paper; he will eventually acquire 
more than 150 works by Kandinsky. 
19305 Guggenheim's growing collection is installed in his private apartment at the Plaza 
Hotel in New York. Small exhibitions of newly acquired works are held there 
intermittently for the public. Rebay organizes a landmark loan exhibition entitled 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Collection of Non-Objective Paintings, which travels to 
Charleston, South Carolina; Philadelphia; and Baltimore. 
1937 The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation is formed for the 'promotion and 
encouragement and education in art and the enlightenment of the public." Chartered by 
the Board of Regents of New York State, the Foundation is endowed to operate one or 
more museums. Solomon Guggenheim is elected the first President of the Foundation, 
and Rebay is appointed its Curator. 
1938 At age forty, Peggy Guggenheim, Solomon's niece, opens Guggenheim Jeune, a 
commercial art gallery in London representing such avant-garde artists as Jean Cocteau, 
Kandinsky, and Yves Tanguy. Initially advised by Herbert Read and Marcel Duchamp, she 
soon begins to amass her own important collection of Surrealist and abstract art. 
1939 Under the auspices of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, the Museum of 
Non-Objective Painting opens in rented quarters at 24 East Fifty-fourth Street. Under 
Rebay's direction, the museum— decorated with pleated gray velour on the walls and 
thick gray carpeting, and featuring recorded classical music and Incense—showcases 
Solomon's collection of American and European abstract artists. 
1942 Peggy opens Art of This Century, a unique gallery-museum on Fifty-seventh Street 
in New York, designed by Frederick Kiesler. The inaugural installation features her own 
collection displayed in unconventional ways. Over the next five years, Peggy mounts 
dozens of important exhibitions devoted to European and American artists such as 
Giorgio de Chinas, Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko. 
1943 Solomon and Reba), commission Frank Lloyd Wright to design a permanent 
structure to house the Museum of Non-Objective Painting. Over the next fifteen years, 
Wright will make some 700 sketches, and six separate sets of working drawings, for the 
building. The Foundation acquires a tract of land between East Eighty-eighth and Eighty-
ninth Streets on Fifth Avenue, but construction Is delayed until 1956 for various reasons, 
foremost among them postwar inflation. 
1949 One year after Peggy exhibits her now fabled collection of Cubist, Surrealist, and 
European abstract painting and sculpture at the Venice Biennale, she purchases the 
Palazzo Venter dei Leoni on Venice's Grand Canal, installs her collection there, and opens 
it to the public. She establishes the Peggy Guggenheim Foundation to operate and endow 
the museum. 
1952 Rebay resigns and James Johnson Sweeney is named Director of the museum. The 
name of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting is changed to the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum to designate it as a memorial to its founder, who died in 1949, and 
to signify a shift toward a broader view of modern and contemporary art. Under 
Sweeney, the Foundation purchases several sculptures by Constantin Brancusi and other
