For the Period 8/1/12 to 8/31/12 
Direct private equity investments are generally valued at cost, unless there 
is an active secondary trading market in the securities, in which case, 
direct private equity investments are valued using market 
prices as of the close of the last business day for this statement period. 
Pooled private equity investments are valued according to the General 
Partner's or Manager's stated methodology. Please refer 
to the limited partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or 
other operative documentation for each investment for the specific valuation 
methodology used by the General Partner or 
Manager for that investment or for your Investment Management or Trust 
account contact your J.P. Morgan team. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any 
responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the 
information and the methodology used by the General Partner or Manager in 
deriving valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in compiling or 
disseminating the valuations, and (3) any use to which the 
valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information purposes only 
and are intended solely for your own use. 
Hedge funds generally calculate the price (the "Net Asset Value" or " NAV"), 
10-15 business days following the last business day of the month. For that 
reason, hedge fund NAVs shown will generally be 
the NAV of the month preceding this statement period. In general, the NAV is 
stated net of management and incentive fees. The NAV is calculated according 
to the General Partner's or Manager's 
stated methodology. Please refer to the limited partnership agreement, 
limited liability company agreement or other operative documentation for 
each hedge fund for the specific methodology used by 
the General Partner or Manager for that hedge fund or for your Investment 
Management or Trust account contact your J.P. Morgan team. J.P. Morgan 
expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the 
accuracy of the information and the methodology used by the General Partner 
or Manager in deriving valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in compiling 
or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any use 
to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information 
purposes only and are intended solely for your own use. 
These statements do not provide tax reporting on private investments. Please 
continue to rely upon the General Partner or Manager of the investment 
vehicle for this information or for your Investment 
Management or Trust account contact your J.P. Morgan team. 
2. The 'Capital Called Since Inception USD' and 'Cash/Security distributions 
Since Inception USD' columns are updated monthly to reflect activity 
(capital calls and distributions), if any. 
3. Hedge funds generally allow subscriptions on a monthly or quarterly 
basis. An interest in a hedge fund or hedge fund of funds is generally as of 
the first business day of the subscription period. Due 
to early funding requirements by the applicable fund, your account may be 
debited for the subscription amount prior to the subscription date. Please 
refer to the applicable hedge fund's operative 
documentation for further details or for your Investment Management or Trust 
account contact your J.P. Morgan team. 
Hedge fund redemptions are generally on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis
