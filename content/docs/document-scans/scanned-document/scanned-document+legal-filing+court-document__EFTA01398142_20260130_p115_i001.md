Important Information (1/2) 
This confidential presentation (this "Presentation") is being made available 
to you (the "Recipient") by Glendower Capital, LLP ("Glendower"), which is 
authorized and regulated by the United Kingdom 
Financial Conduct Authority, for the purpose of providing certain summary 
information about certain existing and future funds and accounts that are 
managed or advised by Glendower, including in 
connection with your evaluation of a potential investment in the fund be to 
known as Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV, LP (the "Fund"). 
This Presentation may refer to certain events as having occurred and 
documents as having been entered into which may not have occurred or been 
entered into at the date that this Presentation is 
made available but that Glendower expects will occur or be entered into 
thereafter. 
This Presentation is not an offer to sell, nor a solicitation of an offer to 
buy, any security, and may not be used or relied upon in connection with any 
offer or solicitation. A private offering of interests in 
the Fund will be made only pursuant to the offering documents for the Fund, 
which contain additional information about the investment objective, terms 
and conditions of an investment in the Fund and 
also contain tax information and risk disclosures that are important to any 
investment decision regarding the Fund. No person has been authorized to 
make any statement concerning the Fund other 
than as set forth in the offering documents and any such statements, if 
made, may not be relied upon. The offering documents will be furnished to 
qualified investors on a confidential basis at their 
request. The information contained in this Presentation will be superseded 
by, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, such offering 
documents. 
An investment in the Fund will involve significant risks, including loss of 
the entire investment. The interests in the Fund will be illiquid, as there 
is no secondary market for interests in the Fund and 
none is expected to develop. There will be restrictions on transferring 
interests in the Fund, investments may be leveraged and the investment 
performance may be volatile. Before deciding to invest in 
the Fund, prospective investors should read the offering memorandum and pay 
particular attention to the risk factors contained in the offering 
documents. The fees and expenses charged in 
connection with an investment in the Fund may be higher than the fees and 
expenses of other investment alternatives and may offset profits. Investors 
should have the financial ability and willingness 
to accept the risk characteristics of the Fund's investments. 
Potential conflicts of interest may arise from the relationship between 
Credit Suisse Asset Management Limited and its affiliates ("Credit Suisse"), 
which is acting as the Fund's placement agent. Credit 
Suisse is not acting and will not act as a municipal advisor within the 
meaning of Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act and the rules and regulations 
promulgated thereunder ("Municipal Advisor Rule").
