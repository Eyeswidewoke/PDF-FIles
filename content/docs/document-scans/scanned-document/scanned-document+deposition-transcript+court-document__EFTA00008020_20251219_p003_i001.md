Danger Zones 
These areas contain important pieces of your anatomy in exposed and vulnerable positions. Highly trained 
to stay
ed
therapists can actually work in these areas, but if you're not a massage professional yourself, it's boner
away from the following spots: 
vs Front of the neck/throat: You've heard of the expression, "Go for the jugular," right? Well, this is where you 
find it. Unless you're trying to choke someone, it's a good idea to stay away from this area that also 
contains the carotid artery and major nerves. 
iv Side of the neck: Not quite as sensitive as the front of the neck, you should still treat delicately. 
V 
The "ear notch": Just behind your jawbone and beneath your ear you find a little notch. It's not a good idea 
to jam a finger into this notch, unless you're trying to extort money or favors from the person receiving the 
massage, as it contains a sensitive facial nerve. 
v 
The eyeball: Unless you're trying to do a Three Stooges massage (popular amongst college males). don't 
poke your fingers directly into the person's eyes. 
v 
The exilic This is a fancy term for the armpit which, as you know, is a sensitive area, filled with nerves, 
arteries, and lymph glands. Not to mention, most people are very ticklish there. 
v 
The upper inner arm: Just down from the armpit, along the inside of the upper arm, is a sensitive, nerve 
filled area along the length of the arm bone. Pressing here too firmly gives you that yucky•nervy feeling. 
V 
The ulnar notch of the elbow: Otherwise known as the "funny bone," this spot contains the ulnar nerve 
which, if you touch it too hard, causes normally discrete people to curse in several languages. 
v 
The abdomen: Houdini was killed by an unexpected punch to this area, which is filled with many squishy 
important bits known as organs. Be especially gentle around the upper abdomen along the ribs, where you 
find the liver, gall bladder, and spleen. 
v 
The lower back: Just to both sides of the spine, and below the ribs, is where you find the kidneys. Don't 
press too hard here or pound on them. Kidneys don't like it when you do that. 
v 
The femoral triangle: Not to be confused with the Bermuda triangle, this area is often referred to as the 
"groin.- It's the inner part of the line in front where your leg meets your body. If you press too hard here 
you can actually cut off circulation to the leg. 
 Popliteal area: Popularly known as the back of the knee, you should always treat this spot gingerly. It's 
very sensitive to pressure.
