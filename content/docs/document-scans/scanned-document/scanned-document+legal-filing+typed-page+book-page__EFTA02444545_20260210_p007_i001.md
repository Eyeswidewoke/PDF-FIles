ence makes it possible to patch up (but 
not cure) many previously terminal 
conditions, a serious collision of inter-
ests seems inevitable. 
Second, and more complicated, are 
the 
demographic 
consequences of 
reaching the technical goal of building 
a medical capability that greatly pro-
longs healthy life. Balancing prolonga-
tion of life span. birthrate, and popula-
tion control requires arithmetically that 
something give: there must be either 
limitations on birthrates or limitations 
on life spans. We may find that we have 
a choice: "New life or old?" Placing 
termination of life—killing a person—
on the same footing as birth control—an 
everyday part of recreational sex—
would mean a fundamental shift in 
values.

5. All Are Born Equal 
An assumption in many western 
societies is equality at birth: equal rights 
under law, and equal access to oppor-
tunity. This assumption is respectful of 
the individual, and there have been no 
means—or no means that we have 
chosen to validate and adopt—of quan-
tifying inequality. Ge-
netics has the potential 
 
to change our conven-
ient inability to mea-
sure innate capability: 
cognitive science and 
psychology will also 
contribute. 
Genomic 
analysis 
of individuals is just dawning. The first 
complete maps of the human genome 
are still being refined, and the task of 
correlating and confirming the associa-
tion of single genes and gene clusters 
with the characteristics of individuals 
has begun. It is the "Panama Canal" 
project of modem biology. Eventually 
there will be a highly profitable shipping 
trade between the genomic and pheno-
typic oceans, but now there is a lot of 
mud to move and many mosquitoes to 
swat. We do not know how complicated 
the task will be: it is possible that the 
characteristics that make us what we are 
will be determined by single proteins or 
relatively uncomplicated clusters of pro-
teins, and that genomics will open a 
window directly onto behavior and ca-
pability; it is more probable that these 
characteristics reflect the behavior of 
complex biological systems, and will 
require many decades to decipher. In 
any event. even with dramatic improve-
ments in the relevant technologies—
both for the collection of the needed 
biological information and for its anal-
ysis—the task of correlating genetic 
constitution with the potential strengths 
and weaknesses of individuals will re-
quire decades (hut probably not centu-
ries) of work. 
This enterprise—the mapping of 
genomic information onto an under-
standing of capabilities, weaknesses 
and bchaviors—has, of course, the po-
tential for enormous good. It will be one 
foundation for medical science; it will 
help individuals to understand where 
they might be susceptible to damage 
through disease or environmental expo-
sure; it will allow them the opportunity 
to identify and exercise their strongest 
capabilities. 
It will also change society if used to 
classify 
individuals—especially 
chil-
dren—according to these capabilities. 
If it is very easy to collect genomic 
information about individuals, will we 
be able to resist the temptation to use 
this information to un-
derstand as much about

just their susceptibility 
to

smoking, but their abil-
ity to handle the stresses 
of office work, combat, 
or marriage? Or their 
potential to be good parents? Or to pay 
traffic tickets on time? Or to have a 
sense of humor? We are incorrigibly 
curious and mischievous Pandora could 
not resist opening the box; will we do 
any better? 
For good or evil, chemistry is a 
central player in this project. The devel-
opment of analytical systems that allow 
rapid. accurate, inexpensive analysis of 
the genome of individuals; the intimate-
ly linked areas of functional genomics 
and proteomics that will associate genes 
with proteins and proteins with bio-
logical function; the correlation of en-
vironmental 
influences—from 
food 
components to stress, and from stress-

chemistry to build the tools to study 
genomics, proteomics and metabo-

beings according to their characteristics 
and potentials. 
6. We Are Individuals, and Privacy is 
Important 
We are accustomed to thinking of 
ourselves as individuals and as such we 
value the accoutrements of individuali-
ty: freedom of choice, privacy, lack of 
control by others, self-determination. 
We are individuals in the sense that we 
choose our own paths; we keep our own 
secrets: we are unpredictable to others. 
We arc individuals partly by choice, 
and partly by accident: we are not able 
to read the thoughts of others, nor to 
control their thinking. Characteristic of 
the revolutions in information technol-
ogy and in genetics is that they have the 
capability to provide information about 
individuals in such abundance and detail 
that privacy and unpredictability be-
come moot. Many of us now have cell-
phones and other microelectronic assis-
tants; these phones arc a step toward a 
global technology in which everyone is 
able to communicate with anyone on the 
globe, at any time, using sound. sight, 
and data, by portable communications 
systems. The global positioning system 
(GPS) and related systems allow us to 
determine positions: with a simple 
transponder, it will allow others to 
determine our positions. Universal sur-
veillance—by monitors inside buildings; 
from unpiloted, long-endurance vehicles 
outside buildings—will one day allow 
our actions to be monitored continuous-
ly. A history of our behaviors and 
actions can be stored in large databases. 
Genetic analysis has the potential to 
predict capabilities, susceptibilities, and 
patterns of behavior. Sociology and 
psychology, as they become sciences. 
will help to connect the dots between 
molecules and behaviors, and between 
individuals and crowds and societies. 
It may be that it is still impossible to 
read our minds; but if it is possible to 
know our positions and circumstances 
to watch and record our activities, to
