How to Save up to 15% Off a Shopping Bill in Europe 
When shopping in the European Union countries, VAT (equivalent to 
sales tax) is included in the prices that you see, rather than added on 
at the cash register. As a resident outside of the European Union, one 
can reclaim up to 15% off the purchase price when leaving the 
country. And, so not to waste time at the airport foreign exchange 
desks, one can simply indicate on the form that they would like the 
refund to be credited to their American Express® Card. 
A person must be resident outside of the European Union in order to benefit from tax-free 
shopping. VAT rates and minimum spending requirements vary by country. Please refer to 
wvnvemericanexpress.cornaraveltIps for further details. 
To find out more about 
tax-free shopping, please 
visit vNiw.amerIcan 
express.comnraveltIps. 
Please don't forget to ask 
a representative from 
Customs and Excise to 
stamp the form upon foal 
departure.
