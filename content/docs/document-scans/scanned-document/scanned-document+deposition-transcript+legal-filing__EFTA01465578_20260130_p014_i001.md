such offers at any time if at all. Because other dealers are not likely to 
make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to 
trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which HSBC 
Securities (USA) Inc. is willing to buy the Notes. Even if there is a 
secondary 
market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell 
the Notes easily. 
• POTENTIAL CONFLICTS - HSBC and its affiliates play a variety of roles in 
connection with the issuance of the Notes, including acting as 
Calculation Agent and hedging its obligations under the Notes. In performing 
these duties, the economic interests of the Calculation Agent and other 
affiliates of HSBC are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor 
in the Notes. The Initial Spot Rate for the Reference Currency is an intra-
day 
level on the Pricing Date that has been determined by the Calculation Agent. 
Although the Calculation Agent has made all determinations and taken 
all actions in relation to the establishment of the Initial Spot Rate in 
good faith, it should be noted that such discretion could have an impact 
(positive 
or negative) on the value of your Notes. HSBC and the Calculation Agent are 
under no obligation to consider your interests as a holder of the Notes in 
taking any corporate actions or other actions, including the determination 
of the Initial Spot Rate, that might affect the Reference Currency and the 
value of your Notes. 
• THE NOTES ARE NOT INSURED OR GUARANTEED BY ANY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY OF THE 
UNITED STATES OR ANY 
OTHER JURISDICTION — The Notes are not deposit liabilities or other 
obligations of a bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or program of 
the United States or any other jurisdiction. An investment in the 
Notes is subject to the credit risk of HSBC, and in the event that HSBC is 
unable to pay its obligations as they become due, you may not receive the 
full Payment at Maturity of the Notes. 
• HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE REFERENCE CURRENCY SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS AN 
INDICATION OF THE 
FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THE REFERENCE CURRENCY DURING THE TERM OF THE NOTES -
It is impossible to predict 
whether the Spot Rate for the Reference Currency will rise or fall. The 
Reference Currency will be influenced by complex and interrelated political, 
economic, financial and other factors. 
• MARKET DISRUPTIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR RETURN — The Calculation 
Agent may, in its sole discretion, determine that 
the markets have been affected in a manner that prevents it from determining 
the Reference Currency Return in the manner described herein, and 
calculating the amount that we are required to pay you upon maturity, or 
from properly hedging its obligations under the Notes. These events may 
include disruptions or suspensions of trading in the markets as a whole or 
general inconvertibility or non-transferability of one or more currencies. If 
the Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, determines that any of these 
events prevents us or any of our affiliates from properly hedging our
