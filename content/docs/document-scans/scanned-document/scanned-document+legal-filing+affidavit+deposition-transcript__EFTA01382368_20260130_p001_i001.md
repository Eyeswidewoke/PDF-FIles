Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Ittbk of Contents 
Securities Subject to the 2015 Incentive Platt. A maximum of five percent (5%) of the shares of our common stock that are 
outstanding as of the consummation of this offering may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2015 Incentive Plan. The 
number of shares of our common stock available under the 2015 Incentive Plan will be reduced by one share for each share issued 
under an award. The shares of our common stock covered by the 2015 Incentive Plan may be treasury shares, authorized but unissued 
shares or shares purchased in the open market. 
In the event of any termination, expiration, lapse or forfeiture of an award, any shares subject to the award will again be made 
available for future grants under the 2015 Incentive Plan. Any shares of restricted stock repurchased by the company at the same price 
paid for such shares will be made available for issuance again under the 2015 Incentive Plan. 
FligibiliN. All of our employees, consultants, and directors, and employees and consultants of our affiliates, will be eligible to 
receive awards under the 2015 Incentive Plan. 
Awards under the 2015 Incentive Plaq. The 2015 Incentive Plan provides that the administrator may grant or issue stock options, 
which may be non-qualified stock options ("NQSOs") or, solely to eligible employees, incentive stock options designed to comply with the 
applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred 
stock, performance awards and stock payments, or any combination thereof. The terms and conditions of each award will be set forth in 
a separate agreement with the person receiving the award and will indicate the type, terms and conditions of the award. 
Award Limits. The 2015 Incentive Plan provides for a maximum aggregate amount of shares of common stock that may be granted 
to a participant in any calendar year subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of 
the potential benefits intended to be made available under the 2015 Incentive Plan, as described below. In addition, the 2015 Incentive 
Plan provides for an annual award limit for performance awards that are payable solely in cash. 
Vesting and Exercise of Awards. The applicable award agreement will contain the period during which the right to exercise the 
award in whole or in part vests, including the events or conditions upon which the vesting of an award may accelerate. No portion of an 
award which is not vested at the participant's termination of employment, termination of directorship or termination of consulting 
relationship, as applicable, will subsequently become vested, except as may be otherwise provided by the administrator either in the 
agreement relating to the award or by action following the grant of the award. 
Transferability of Awards. Awards generally may not be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or 
by the laws of descent and distribution or, subject to the consent of the administrator, pursuant to a domestic relations order, unless and 
until such award has been exercised, or the shares underlying such award have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such 
shares have lapsed. Notwithstanding the foregoing. NQSOs may be transferred without consideration to certain family members and 
trusts with the administrator's consent. Awards may be exercised, during the lifetime of the participant, only by the participant or such 
permitted transferee. 
Forfeiture and Claw-Back Provisions. In the event a participant (i) terminates service with the company prior to a specified date or 
within a specified time following receipt or exercise of the award, (ii) the company terminates the participant's service for "cause," or 
(iii) the participant engages in certain competitive activities with the company, the administrator has the right to require the participant to 
repay any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively received by the
