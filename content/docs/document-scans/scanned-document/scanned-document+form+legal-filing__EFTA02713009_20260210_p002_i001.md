Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-I) is commonly encountered first during childhood as an oral infection. 
After this initial infection resolves, the virus remains in a latent form within innervating sensory ganglia for 
the life of the host. We have previously shown, using a murine model, that IISV-I placed within the lumen of 
the esophagus gains access to nerves within the gut all and establishes a latent infection in sensory ganglia 
(nodose ganglia) of the tenth cranial nerve (R. M. Lesser, T. Valyi-Nagy, S. M. Altschuler, and N. W. Fraser, 
J. Gen. Virol. 75:2379-2386. 1994). Peripheral processes of neurons in these ganglia travel through the vagus 
nerve and function as primary sensory receptors in most of the gastrointestinal tract, relaying information 
from the gut wall and mucosal surface to secondary neurons within the brain stem. In the work described here. 
we further examined the spread of HSV-I through the enteric nervous system after oral inoculation. By 
immunohistochemistry, IISV-I was found to infect myenteric ganglia in Auerbach's plexus between the inner 
and outer muscle layers of the gut wall. submucosal ganglia (Meisner's plexus). and periglandular ganglion 
plexuses surrounding submucosal glands. Virus-infected nerve fibers were also seen projecting through the 
mucosal layer to interact directly with surface epithelial cells. These intramucosal nerve fibers may be a 
conduit by which intraluminal virus Is able to gain access to the enteric nervous system from the gastroin-
testinal lumen. 
Oral infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-I) 
during childhood causes either an asymptomatic infection or 
an acute infection of the gums, oral mucosa. and tongue 
termed gingivostomatitis (7, 12, 37). That a considerable per-
centage of the population is exposed to HSV-1 early in life is 
attested to by seroepidemiologic studies which demonstrate 
rising levels of seropositivity for HSV during childhood, with 
70 to 90% positivity by adulthood (7. II, 25, 37). Like other 
alphaherpesviruses (pseudorabies virus, varicella-zoster virus, 
and bovine herpcsvirus), HSV-1 exhibits tropism for the pe-
ripheral prortws of nerves which innervate the body surface 
(34, 35). Upon entering a nerve ending, the virus is actively 
transported to the nerve cell nucleus located in sensory gan-
glia, often a considerable distance away from the initial site of 
inoculation (10). Following an acute infection in these ganglia, 
the HSV-1 gcnome may remain in a latent form within the 
nuclei of sensory neurons for the life of the host or periodically 
reactivate to cause recrudescent disease or asymptomatic shed-
ding at the body's surface. While HSV-1 is most commonly 
thought to latently infect the trigeminal ganglion of the fifth 
cranial nerve innervating the face and oral mucosa (2, 3), latent 
HSV-1 has also been found in humans in the nodose ganglia 
innervating the gastrointestinal tract (36). Furthermore, the 
virus is a frequent cause of recurrent esophageal mucosal dis-
ease in humans• particularly those who are immunocompro-
mised (1, 8, 13, 26. 38). We have recently shown that HSV-1, 
orally inoculated into the esophageal lumen of mice, travels to

the sensory ganglion (nodose ganglion) of the vagus or tenth 
cranial nerve, where it establishes a latent infection (17). This 
discovery led us to believe that HSV-1 may also be an enteri-
cally acquired pathogen that is able to breach the mucosal 
surface of the gut to encounter nerve fibers of the enteric 
nervous system. 
The nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract consists of a 
complex intrinsic network of interconnected neurons within 
the gut wall itself (enteric nervous system) (reviewed in refer-
ence 15). These vast numbers of enteric neurons direct move-
ment, secretions, and blood flow within the alimentary tract 
and are regulated by local reflex pathways within the gut as 
well as by extrinsic innervation from sympathetic, spinal, and 
vagal parasympathetic nerves. Primary sensory neurons in the 
nodose ganglia, responding to different sensory modalities, 
send afferent fibers via the vagus nerve to most of the gastro-
intestinal wall. Mechanoreceptors (sensitive to stroking)• che-
moreceptors (responsive to acidity, hypertonicity, and intralu-
minal chemical composition), and thermoreceptors have been 
localized to the gut mucosa by functional studies; mechanore-
ceptors arc also found in the muscular and serosal layers 
throughout the gastrointestinal tract (reviewed in references 
19, 28, and 29). Via these receptors, vagal sensory pathways are 
able to respond to and modify changes in the gastrointestinal 
lumen. 
In mice after oral inoculation, HSV-1 infects myenteric and 
nodose ganglia and spreads to secondary sensory neurons (to 
which the nodose ganglia centrally project) within the nucleus 
tractus solitarius of the medulla (17, 18). Because HSV-I de-
livered intraluminally to mice appears to target neurons of the 
enteric nervous system and preferentially spread to. infect, and 
establish latency in neurons of the vagus nerve sensory path-
ways, we questioned whether terminal vagus nerve fibers were 
involved in the spread of HSV-I after oral inoculation. In the
