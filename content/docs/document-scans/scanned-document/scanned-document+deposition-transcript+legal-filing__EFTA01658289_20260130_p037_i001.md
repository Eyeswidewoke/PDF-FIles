Republican Senate proposing to scale back aid to the unemployed, the pain is likely to continue 
and potentially worsen in the months ahead." 
According to the New York Times (7/30, 18.61M), recent "data from public and private 
sources indicate a pullback in economic activity, reflecting consumer unease and renewed 
shutdowns." Likewise, Bloomberg (7/30, Pickert, 4.73M) says the recent "surge" in coronavirus 
cases, "the result of America's failure to contain the virus, indicates that the U.S. economy is 
likely to recover more slowly than places that have done a better job, such as the euro area." 
Bloomberg adds, "And the longer the pandemic lasts without a vaccine, the longer economic 
output will remain below pre-crisis levels, leaving permanent scars on many businesses and 
workers." USA Today (7/30, Davidson, 10.31M), the Los Angeles Times (7/30, Lee, 4.64M) and 
the Wall Street Journal (7/30, Al, Torry, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), among other news 
outlets, also report the story. 
In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal (7/30, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) criticizes 
Democrats and what it calls their media allies for pushing for further lockdowns after seeing 
their devastating effects on the economy - as illustrated by Thursday's GDP data. 
Stocks Sharply Down On GDP Data. USA Today (7/30, Menton, 10.31M) reports, 
"Stocks slumped on Wall Street Thursday after the U.S. posted a record economic contraction in 
the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic battered the economy, leading to widespread 
business shutdowns." Reuters (7/30, Carew) reports "the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 
225.92 points, or 0.85%, to 26,313.65, the S&P 500 lost 12.22 points, or 0.38%, to 3,246.22 
and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.87 points, or 0.43%, to 10,587.81." 
Biden Blames Trump For Causing Recession To Be Worse Than It Could It Have 
Been. CNBC (7/30, Higgins, 3.62M) reports on its website that on Thursday, Joe Biden "came 
out swinging against President Donald Trump's record on the economy...hours after new data 
showed the US suffered its worst quarterly downturn in history in the midst of the spreading 
coronavirus pandemic." Biden said, "The depth of economic devastation our nation is 
experiencing is not an act of God, it's a failure of presidential leadership. ... Had President 
Trump taken immediate and decisive action, tens of thousands of lives and millions of jobs 
would never have been lost." 
Weekly Jobless Claims Rise To 1.434M As Senators Remain Divided On Extending 
Benefit. 
CNBC (7/30, Imbert, 3.62M) says on its website that the Labor Department reported Thursday 
that "the number of Americans who filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week 
totaled 1.434 million," making it "the 19th straight week in which initial claims totaled at least 1 
million and the second consecutive week in which initial claims rose after declining for 15 
straight weeks." Continuing claims, that is "those receiving unemployment benefits for at least 
two straight weeks," increased "by 867,000 to 17.018 million for the week ending July 18." 
Bloomberg (7/30, Rockeman, 4.73M) says "the jump in continuing claims was concentrated in 
California and Texas, which reported a combined increase of about 576,000 on an unadjusted 
basis," while Florida "showed a decline of about 122,000." Jo Ling Kent of NBC Nightly NewsVI 
(7/30, story 7, 1:00, Holt, 5.82M) provided similar coverage, as did the CBS Evening NewsVi 
(7/30, story 7, 0:50, O'Donnell, 4.19M). 
The New York Times (7/30, Lee, 18.61M) reports that "new claims for Pandemic 
Unemployment Assistance, the government's program aimed at covering freelancers, the self-
employed and other workers not covered by traditional unemployment benefits, totaled 
830,000, down from 975,000 the week before." Meanwhile, "the $600 supplemental weekly 
unemployment payment from the federal government is ending, a potentially crippling financial 
blow to millions." The Washington Post (7/30, 14.2M) reports that Democrats "want the full 
$600 extended through January, while some Republicans have proposed reducing it to $200 a 
week."
