Perspective from 
Larry V. Adam, U.S. Wealth Management CIO and Chief Investment Strategist 
od o " 
';L 
The third quarter of 2015 was dominated by weak 
global trade and deteriorating commodity prices (DJ 
Commodity Index —14.5% QoQ) that clouded the 
global growth outlook, especially for the emerging 
markets. Commodity producing countries such as 
Russia and Brazil ended the quarter in recession while 
emerging market (EM) currencies fell to a record low. 
As a result, aggressive measures were taken by 
central banks as the People's Bank of China devalued 
its currency at the fastest pace since 2014, India, 
China, Canada, Korea and Russia cut rates and the 
Fed delayed its long awaited rate hike. While U.S. 
growth was resilient due to better domestic demand 
and improving housing market, the ongoing 
deterioration in the energy renaissance weighed on 
manufacturing as seen by the ISM Manufacturing 
Index falling to a two-year low. As a result, U.S. GDP 
is on pace to slow from 3.9% (2Q15) to 2.5% (3Q15). 
As the global growth outlook became uncertain, risk 
assets suffered. Global equities (MSCI AC World in 
USD -9.3% QoQ) fell at the fastest pace since 3Q11. 
In addition, emerging markets (MSCI EM in USD 
-17.8%) underperformed developed markets (MSCI 
EAFE in USD -10.2%) by the widest margin since 
4Q08. The U.S. fared better than Japan (MSCI Japan 
in USD —10.7% and Europe (MSCI Europe ex UK in 
USD -8.0%) but posted its worst quarterly decline 
since 3Q11 (-6.4%). The sell off in risky assets also 
spilled into high yield and emerging market bonds 
which fell sharply (-4.9% and -2.4%, respectively). In 
contrast, the sell off sparked a flight to quality as 
Treasuries (+1.8%) and the Dollar (+0.8%) rallied.

The disappointing September jobs report (+142K jobs 
created) will likely continue to fuel the debate over the 
timing of the Fed's first rate hike. With two 
consecutive months of below 150K jobs being 
created, Fed funds futures suggest the first rate hike 
will not happen until March 2016 at the earliest. 
Ironically, with the understanding that the economy is 
approaching full employment San Francisco Fed 
President John Williams yesterday said a gain of 
"above 100,000 or 150,000 [jobs] would be good to 
me," suggesting that the rate of healing is naturally 
slowing and expected. The bottom line is that our 
U.S. economist, Josh Feinman, believes that Fed 
policymakers will bide their time, holding their powder 
at the October FOMC meeting and waiting for more 
evidence before making their decision in December. 
The recent slower pace of improvement in the labor 
market likely makes the hurdle for lift-off in December 
higher, but a move at that meeting remains very 
much alive. Next week, the September meeting 
FOMC Minutes will be released (Thursday) and 
provide additional insights into the differing opinions 
(e.g. Lacker's dissent) within the committee. 
I.::; T;. 
Next week (Thursday), kicks of the "unofficial" start to 
3Q15 eamings season. With the Fed on hold until 
December and equity markets remaining highly 
volatile, the new focus for market direction is the 
health of corporate earnings. While Alcoa is the only 
major company to release eamings next week, 
eamings season kicks into full gear in the weeks of 
October 12th, 19th and 26th when nearly 80% of the 
S&P 500 companies report earnings. Currently, 
consensus expects earnings to decline 3.3% (YoY) 
led by weakness in commodity-related sectors (e.g. 
energy and materials). However, we expect eamings 
to ultimately beat expectations by —3-5% to come in 
flat to slightly positive YoY.
