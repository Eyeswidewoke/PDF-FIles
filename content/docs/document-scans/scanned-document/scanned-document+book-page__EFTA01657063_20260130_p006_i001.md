Because the Cognitive Interview is more complex and en-
courages more extensive and focused retrieval. we expected it 
to take longer to conduct than the standard police interview 
Such differences have been found in previous laboratory studies 
(Fisher, Geiselman, Raymond, Jurkevich, & Warhaftig, 1987; 
Geiselman et al., 1985); however, in neither of these two studies 
was the extra time responsible for the superiority of the Cogni-
tive Interview. In the present study, the interview times were 
surprisingly similar for the various interviews. The posttrained 
interviews of the trained detectives (11.47 min) were not reli-
ably longer than their pretrained interviews( l0.65 min) or than 
those conducted by the untrained detectives (9.05 min). both 
h's< I, 
= (1, 6) and ( I, II), and Atces = 10.587 and 21.295, 
respectively. Of the sewn trained detectives, four took more 
time to conduct posttrained interviews than pretrained inter-
views, and three took less time. In this study, therefore, the ob-
served superiority of the Cognitive Interview over the standard 
police interview was not due to differences in interview time. 
Discussion 
The overall pattern of data—an increase in the amount of 
investigatively relevant information accompanied by extremely 
high corroboration ratcs--provides strong support for the 
effectiveness of the Cognitive Interview in field investigations. 
Training in the Cognitive Interview enhanced performance in 
both the before-after and the between-groups comparisons. Six 
of the seven detectives improved with training; only the one de-
tective who did not use the technique as intended did not im-
prove. In the between-groups comparison, the two groups of 
detectives were equivalent before training, as judged by their 
supervisors and by empirical observations. After training, the 
trained detectives elicited 63% more information. That the 
effectiveness of the training was comparable for the before-after 
and between-groups comparisons suggests that the conclusions 
are unlikely to be a product of anything unique to either design. 
Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect (50%-60% improve-
ment) is reasonably dose to what we would expect on the basis 
of the previous laboratory findings, in which the revised tech-
nique was 45% more effective than the original (Fisher Geisel-
man. Raymond, Jurkevich, & Warhaftig, 1987), which, in turn, 
was 25%-35% more effective than standard police interviews 
(Geiselman et al., 1985; Geiselman, Fisher, Cohen, et al., 1986). 
The similarity of the corroboration rates associated with the 
Cognitive Interview and with standard police interviews also 
mirrors the findings from our laboratory studies, in which aeon-
racy rates were equivalent. In sum, the Cognitive Interview in-
creased the effectiveness of investigative interviews without any 
apparent negative consequences. 
How does the Cognitive Interview compare with other mem-
ory-enhancing techniques used by investigative interviewers? 
Historically, little training has been provided to law-enforce-
ment interviewers to enhance the recollection of cooperative 
witnesses. Similarly, there is no formal training in memory-en-
hancement techniques for law students or attorneys to conduct 
effective interviews with clients, even though the fact-finding 
stage is often critical to successful legal inquiry (Fisher, 1986). 
We know of no formal technique other than hypnosis that ap-
pears regularly in the training of investigative interviewers, at 
least for memory-enhancement purposes. How does the Cogni-
tive Interview compare with hypnosis? Although we have never 
directly compared the current version of the Cognitive Inter-
view with hypnosis, Fisher, Geisclman, Raymond, Jurlcevich, 
and Warhaftig (1987) found that in similar observing condi-
tions across two experiments, the Cognitive Interview elicited 
33.4% more correct information than did hypnosis. The Cogni-
tive Interview also is not beset with the problems sometimes 
found with hypnosis. The Cognitive Interview does not lead to 
increased error rates and does not render respondents hypersug-
gestible to leading questions; if anything, it mitigates the effect 
(Geiselman, Fisher, MacKinnon, et al., 1986). Yuillc and Kim 
(1987) recently analyzed several police hypnosis interviews and 
found that interviewers frequently used some components of 
the Cognitive Interview. Yuille and Kim concluded that "the 
advantage of hypnosis found in the present study has nothing 
to do with hypnosis. . . . [Instead) the cognitive interview is the 
'active' memory component of hypnosis" (p. 427). Because the 
Cognitive Interview has been a reliable technique to enhance 
recall, yet has none of the negative consequences of hypnosis, 
it has been suggested as a preferable alternative (Delfenbacher 
1988; Orne, as cited in Commonwealth v. Di Nicole', 1985), and 
one that should be more acceptable by the courts (Yoffie & 
Kim, 1987). 
In addition to its technical merit, the Cognitive Interview has 
considerable practical utility; that is, (a) the technique can be 
learned within a few hours, (b) it requires little theoretical back-
ground or previous training, and (c) it is easily administered. 
Finally, because the technique is based primarily on proper tim-
ing, sequencing, and phrasing of questions, the respondent 
should not perceive that any special intervention is occurring. 
As such, eyewitnesses should have no apprehensions about par-
ticipating in this form of interview. 
Although the Cognitive Interview is an effective investigative 
instrument. there are a few limitations. First, its usefulness may 
vary from one event to another Its primary contribution for 
police will be in cases such as commercial robbery or battery, 
in which the bulk of the evidence comes from eyewitness re-
ports, as opposed to crimes that rely more heavily on physical 
evidence. Second, the Cognitive Interview can be used only with 
cooperative witnesses. Witnesses who wish to withhold infor-
mation intentionally will not be "broken" by the Cognitive In-
terview. Third, although our study found no differences be-
tween the time taken to conduct the Cognitive Interview and a 
standard interview; we expect that the Cognitive Interview takes 
somewhat longer. It can be used to greatest effect, therefore, 
when there is ample time to conduct the interview. Finally. the 
Cognitive Interview requires considerable mental concentra-
tion on the part of the interviewer He or she must make more 
on-line decisions and show greater flexibility than is typically 
demonstrated in standard police interviews. In that sense, it is 
probably more difficult to conduct the Cognitive Interview than 
the standard interview. As with other skills, however, with prac-
tice, many of the resource-demanding mental operations re-
quired initially will he handled automatically. 
Because this version of the Cognitive Interview contains sev-
eral components, we cannot be sure which of the suggested 
techniques are primarily responsible for its overall effectiveness. 
Some components may have only marginal value. Others may 
vary depending on the specific features of the interview, for ex-
ample, whether the witness is a child or an adult and whether
