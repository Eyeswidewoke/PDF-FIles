appointment) which are payable to (or exercisable by) such trust or over which my 
Trustees have any right, title, interest, or power; and 
L. 
To make, execute, and deliver any and all such instruments in 
writing as shall be necessary or proper to carry out any power, right, duty, or obligation of 
my Trustees or any disposition whatsoever of such trust or any asset of such trust and to 
exercise any and all other powers incidental or necessary to carry out or to fulfill the 
terms, provisions and purposes of such trust. 
Section 6.5. - Restrictions on Exercise of My Trustee's Powers 
A. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a 
Trustee shall not participate in a discretionary decision to exercise or not exercise any 
fiduciary power to (1) distribute income from or principal of any trust hereunder to 
himself or herself; or (2) distribute income from or principal of any trust hereunder for the 
health, support, maintenance or education of a Beneficiary if such Trustee has a legal 
obligation to provide for the health, support, maintenance or education of such 
Beneficiary from such Trustee's personal assets. For purposes of this paragraph, a person 
whose interest in a trust hereunder is limited to a remote contingent interest (for example, 
a contingent remainderman whose interest depends upon another person failing to survive 
to a specified age or a person designated to receive assets only in the event a power of 
appointment is not exercised) shall not be treated as a person who is or may be a 
Beneficiary of such trust. 
B. 
A Trustee of any trust hereunder may by a written notice delivered to 
the other Trustee (or Trustees) of such trust decline to participate in the decision to 
exercise or not exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Agreement or by law. 
C. 
If a Trustee of any trust hereunder is not empowered (because of a 
conflict of interest, declination to act or otherwise) to participate in the decision to exercise 
or not exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Agreement or by law, then the 
remaining Trustee or Trustees of such trust shall be empowered to make such decision. If 
no Trustee or successor Trustee is empowered to participate in such decision, my Trustees 
may designate a substitute Trustee to serve as Trustee of such trust who shall be 
empowered to make such decision but has no other power or authority of the Trustees. 
Such designation shall be by written notice delivered to such substitute Trustee.

In the event a Trustee resigns, is removed, becomes incapacitated or is unwilling or 
is unable to serve, KATHRYN RUEMMLER shall be appointed the successor trustee. In 
the event that any additional Trustees are removed, become incapacitated, or are unwilling 
or unable to serve, STEPHEN HANSON shall first be appointed to fill any vacancy, such
