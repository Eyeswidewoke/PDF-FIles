Applicable for Residents of Florida for Travel Accident Insurance: 
The definition of Covered Person is hereby removed from the DEFINITIONS section in its entirety and replaced 
with the following: 
Covered Person means the Basic Cardmember, each Additional Cardmember, and each of these 
Cardmember's spouses or Domestic Partners and dependent children under 26 years of age (dependent children 
include: your unmarried, dependent children under 26 years of age who rely on You for support and 
maintenance. your unmarried dependent children 26 years or older who because of a handicap condition that 
occurred before the attainment of the limiting age, are incapable of self-sustaining employment and dependent 
upon You for lifetime care and supervision. Coverage will be extended for as long as such child is incapacitated, 
unmarried and dependent.). All Covered Persons must have a Permanent Residence within the 50 United States 
of America, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands. All other persons are not Covered 
Persons under the Policy. Dependent coverage will extend to the end of the calendar year when the dependent 
reaches age 30 when: 1. The dependent is unmarried and does not have a dependent of his or her own; 2. Is a 
resident of this state or a full-time or part-time student: and 3. Is not provided coverage as a named subscriber, 
insured, enrollee, or covered person under any other group, blanket, or franchise health insurance policy or 
individual health benefits plan, or is not entitled to benefits under Title XVIII of the Social Security Ad. 4. If, 
pursuant to this section. a child is provided coverage under the parent's policy after the end of the calendar year 
in which the child reaches age 25 and coverage for the child is subsequently terminated, the child is not eligible 
to be covered under the parent's policy unless the child was continuously covered by other creditable coverage 
without a gap in coverage of more than 63 days. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "creditable 
coverage" has the same meaning as provided in Florida Insurance Code s. 627.6561(5). Dependent children 
include: 1. Natural, adopted and stepchildren of the insured who are chiefly financially dependent on the insured 
for support and maintenance; 2. An adopted child or a child in the custody of the insured pursuant to an interim 
court order of adoption vesting temporary care of the child in the insured, regardless of whether a final order 
granting adoption is ultimately issued. 
All references to "dependent children under 23 years of age" throughout the document are hereby changed to 
"dependent children under 26 years of age". TAI-RDR1-FL 06110
