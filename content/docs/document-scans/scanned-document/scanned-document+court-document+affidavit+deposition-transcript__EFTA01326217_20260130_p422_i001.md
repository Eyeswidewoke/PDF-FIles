NOTICE 
Weighrand balance or operating limitation changes shall be entered in the appropriate aircraft record. An alteration must be 
compatible with all previous alterations to assure continued conformity with the applicable airworthiness requirements. 
8. Description of Work Accomplished 
(If more space is required, attach additional sheets. Identify with aircraft nationality and registration mark and date work completed.) 
In order to provide continuity during fitture inspections, maintenance or alterations a true dopy of this FAA 
form 337 and all listed Wiring Diagrams must be kept with the aircraft's records as long as the alteration 
remains in effect. 
July 10,1996. Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation {GAC} Model G-IV, Serial Number 1085, N88GA, FAA 
Aircraft Type Certificate Data Sheet A I2EA. Aircraft in-service data: 2241.9 hours & 932 landings. 
Refer to the following FAA Approved Data: GAC Aircraft Service Change {ASC} 143 (ATA 24) Alternator Field 
Current Overcurrent Monitor, dated: October 7, 1994; and FAA Form 81 I 0-3, dated: 7-10-96, Identifying: Drawing 
No. ASC 143-062096, Titled: TOP DRAWING ASC 143 (ATA 241 Alternator Field Overcurrent Monitor Original 
Issue (no revisions), dated: 7-9-96, — the following Wiring Diagrams are listed on the TOP DRAWING: 
• 
Wiring Diagram No. 06209601, Titled: }.EFT SIDE DEVIATIONS dated: JUL 09/96 and 
• 
Wiring Diagram No. 06209602, Titled: RIGHT SIDE DEVIATIONS, dated: JUL 09/96, 
as approved data, signed by: John R. Chambless, NM-567, Systems and Equipment (Electrical). 
The purpose of this alteration is provide an indication that maintenance personnel can use to determine that an 
overload condition has occurred in a main engine alternator field circuit. 
This alteration adds a current sensor assembly and fault latch indicator to the left and right converter shelves and 
modifies the aft equipment compartment wiring. The above referred to Wiring Diagrams show deviations that were 
made to ASC 143 in order to provide a way to disconnect a DC Current Sensor or Alternator Overcurrent indicator 
display without cutting wires. These deviations also add a shield braid for each existing alternator (+) field wire and 
bond both DC Current Sensors, eliminating the need to run new wires to the left and right engine disconnect plugs. 
Performed all of the modification instructions of ASC 143, except as provided for on the above listed Wiring 
Diagrams. 
All parts were purchased from Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation — Savannah, GA and were new at the time of 
installation. 
Successfully performed — ASC 143 Operational Test in accordance with Paragraph E. of the ASC's instructions 
and noted no abnormal conditions or unusual operation. 
Recorded compliance with this FAA form 337 in the aircraft's maintenance records and returned the aircraft to flight 
status. No Airplane Flight Manual revisions were required or installed as a result of this alteration. 
Incorporation of this alteration adds 0.2 amps to the Essential 28 VDC bus. 
The effect of this alteration on the aircraft's basic weight and balance was negligible and no changes were made to 
the aircraft's basic weight and balance report.
