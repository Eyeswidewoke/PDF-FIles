mention the President's Daily Brief (PDB) or intelligence briefings for the president-elect. The 
custom of allowing the president-elect to see the PDB is just that— a custom — and it's 
something the president can do, or refuse to do, at his discretion." 
Meanwhile, Politico (11/12, Bertrand, 4.29M) reports that "a group of more than 150 
former national security officials who served under [Trump] and other Republican and 
Democratic administrations is warning that the government's delay in recognizing" Biden's 
victory "poses a `serious risk to national security." 
Also reporting on the PDB issue are Axios (11/12, Arias, 521K), the Wall Street Journal 
(11/12, Peterson, Wise, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), Bloomberg (11/12, Dennis, 4.73M), 
Reuters (11/12, Cornwell, Chiacu, Lewis), the Washington Times (11/12, Sherfinski, Meier, 
492K), and NPR (11/12, Grisales, 3.12M), among others. 
Meanwhile, according to the New York Times (11/12, Sanger, Stevens, Perlroth, 18.61M), 
"Deprived of access to secure government communications by the Trump administration, Mr. 
Biden's team of more than 500 former officials and outside experts has embraced workarounds, 
talking over encrypted apps like Signal to shield their conversations from the Chinese, meeting 
in outdoor coffee shops with government officials they once worked alongside." The Times adds, 
"The conversations are circumspect, both because of rules on both sides limiting how much 
information Mr. Biden's team can seek and how much executive branch officials are allowed to 
say." 
In Recording, Facebook CEO Defends Decision Not To Suspend Bannon. 
Reuters (11/12, Paul) reports Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg "told an all-staff meeting on 
Thursday that former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon had not violated enough of the 
company's policies to justify his suspension when he urged beheading" Fauci and FBI Director 
Wray, "according to a recording heard by Reuters." Zuckerberg said, "We have specific rules 
around how many times you need to violate certain policies before we will deactivate your 
account completely. ... While the offenses here, I think, came close to crossing that line, they 
clearly did not cross the line." Facebook "removed the video but left up Bannon's page," while 
Twitter "banned Bannon last week over the same content." 
BuzzFeed News (11/12, Mac, Silverman) reports, "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told 
employees on Thursday that the Democratic nominee `is going to be our next president." 
Zuckerberg added, "It's important that people have confidence that the election was 
fundamentally fair, and that goes for the tens of millions of people that voted for Trump." The 
CEO's comments "signify that he believes in the legitimacy of the result," and criticized "people 
claiming that a Biden victory would be overturned." Zuckerberg said "it's...quite unhelpful that 
people out there are raising expectations that there is going to be a different outcome than 
from what was projected." 
Opinion: "Stolen Election" Rhetoric Could Unleash Wave Of Violence. 
Albert Hunt, former executive editor of Bloomberg News, writes in an op-ed in The Hill (11/12, 
2.98M) that white power expert Kathleen Belew "fears Donald Trump's refusal to accept the 
election results may be inciting violence." The claim "that the presidential election was `stolen' 
will likely become a rallying cry for the Trump base." Belew, a history professor at the University 
of Chicago, "dismisses the notion that this often is a `lone wolf' problem." She told Hunt, "These 
militant fringe groups are much more directly connected than is appreciated. ... They share a 
lot of ideas." FBI Director Wray "has said these white power groups are a greater danger than 
the left-wing anarchists oft cited by President Trump and Attorney General William Barr." Hunt 
concludes the claims of a "stolen election" not only undermine "confidence in our Democratic 
system, but...could also threaten to unleash a dangerous wave of violence."
