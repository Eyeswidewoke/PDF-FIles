insofar as is consistent with the laws governing this Agreement; provided, however, that without 
the specific written consent of each Partner (other than a Non-Voting Limited Partner) affected 
thereby, no such modification or amendment shall (i) reduce the Capital Account of any Partner 
or his rights of withdrawal with respect thereto; (ii) increase the Incentive Allocation allocable to 
the General Partner from such Partner's Capital Account; or (iii) amend this Section 8.5. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the right to effect 
immaterial or insubstantial amendments to this Agreement without the consent of any Limited 
Partner, including without limitation, to reflect: a change in the location of the Partnership's 
principal place of business; a change in the registered office or registered agent; a change in the 
name of the Partnership; admission or termination of Partners in accordance with this 
Agreement; a change that is necessary to qualify the Partnership as a limited partnership under 
the laws of any state or that is necessary or advisable in the opinion of the Tax Matters Partner to 
ensure that the Partnership will not be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for 
federal income tax purposes; a change of the provisions relating to the Incentive Allocation so 
that such provisions conform to any applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and other regulatory authorities, so long as such change does not increase the 
Incentive Allocation; a change (i) that is necessary or desirable to satisfy any requirement, 
condition or guideline contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or regulation of any 
federal or state agency or contained in any federal or state statute, compliance with any of which 
the General Partner deems to be in the best interests of the Partnership and the Limited Partners, 
(ii) that is required or contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) that is necessary or desirable to 
implement new regulations published by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to partnership 
allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit; a change to cure any ambiguity, to correct 
or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein, 
or to make any other provision with respect to the matters or questions arising under this 
Agreement which will not be inconsistent with the provisions hereof; or a change that does not 
adversely affect the Limited Partners in any material respect: provided, however, that a Limited 
Partner will not be deemed adversely affected merely because such Limited Partner does not 
receive the benefit of an amendment that benefits other Limited Partners. 
8.6 
Investment Representation. Each Limited Partner hereby acknowledges

not with a view to its resale or distribution.
