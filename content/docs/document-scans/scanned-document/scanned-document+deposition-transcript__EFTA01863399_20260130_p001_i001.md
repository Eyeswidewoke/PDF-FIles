It is really horrendous to be continually used to hurt people you care deeply 
about by the newspapers. It is beyond any words, as you know. 
I know you spoke to James. I of all people understand what it feels like to be 
castagated by the Tabloids. I know how you feel. 
I know you also feel hellaciously let down by me, from what you were either told 
or read, and I must humbly apologise to you and your heart for that. You have 
always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family. 
As you know I did absolutely not say the P. Word about you. But understand it was 
reported that I did. 
However, I am apologising to you today for not replying to your email, or 
reaching out to you when the tabloids were so vicious and horrendous... In the 
weeks leading up to that monday when I made my statement. And then afterwards. 
When they used me to hurt you beyond realms. 
As you know, it was and is the worst nightmare for you, but also for me. As you 
know the whole story did not come about because of me. 
However because of my statement they made it worse for you. I understand all 
this. 
You know me well, and we are steadfast to that. But, I must apologise for not 
reaching out to you or answering your email. It is unlike me. Therefore, you can 
only deduce, that something else must have been going on, for me to react in this 
way. So in the eye of your storm, which I know is hellacious, may I ask you to 
accept my apology for not reaching out to you, in the eye of MY storm, and accept 
and understand that I was in fear beyond all totality and I could not move left 
or right because of it, and was close to bed ridden with the fear of what was 
happening. I was paralysed. I was advised in no uncertain terms to having nothing 
to do with you, and not to speak or email you, and if I did, I would cause more 
problems to both You and The Duke and myself. So I shut down and ran away. I was 
broken and lost. So please understand, as I do about you, that I ws broken and 
not the strong person you know, and I got completely obliterated too, and I saw 
all my childrens work etc disappearing.. I shut down and everyone out. I was 
frightened. The Palace system is frightening, and each step I turned or each 
action was wrong and I did not want to hurt Andrew one more time. 
So Jeffrey, this email is sent with a hope you accept, and understand a little of 
my side too.
