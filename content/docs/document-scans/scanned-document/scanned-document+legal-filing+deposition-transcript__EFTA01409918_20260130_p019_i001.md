Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and 
serve as the foundation for our continued growth: 
Authentic Cuisine — A Culinary Journey to Brazil 
We provide our guests with an experience that is distinctly Brazilian, and 
our food is at the heart of that experience. Our traditional 
Brazilian cuisine has been passed down from generation to generation in 
Brazil and lives on in the way our gaucho chefs prepare, season and 
continuously fire-roast our meats utilizing the traditional cooking method 
of churrasco — fire-roasted on skewers over an open flame to expose 
the natural flavors. Our entrée selection features a variety of carefully 
cooked and seasoned meats including Brazilian style cuts of beef such as 
the fraldinha and the picanha, our signature cut of steak, as well as other 
premium beef cuts such as filet mignon and rib eye, and lamb, 
chicken, pork and seafood items. Each cut is carved table-side by our gaucho 
chefs in a manner designed to both enhance the tenderness of 
each slice and meet our guests' desired portion size and temperature. At 
Fogo de ChAo, every table is a chef's table. To complement our meat 
selection, a variety of sharable side dishes, including warm cheese bread, 
fried bananas and crispy polenta, are brought to each table and 
replenished throughout the meal. For guests preferring lighter fare, we also 
offer Brazilian-inspired a la carte seafood options, a "Market 
Table" only option and a selection of small plates. Our Market Table, which 
features a variety of gourmet side dishes, seasonal salads, 
Brazilian hearts of palm, fresh-cut vegetables, aged cheeses, smoked salmon 
and cured meats is immediately available once our guests are 
seated. We believe it pays homage to the kitchen tables of Southern Brazil 
where families share fresh produce and seasonal salads grown 
locally. Our menu is enhanced by an award-winning wine list and a full bar 
complete with a selection of signature Brazilian drinks such as the 
caipirinha. 
Interactive, Approachable Fine-Dining Experience Delivered By Our Gaucho 
Chefs 
We believe that we offer our guests an upscale, approachable and friendly 
atmosphere in elegant dining rooms that is complemented by 
the personalized, interactive experience with our gaucho chefs and team 
members. Skilled artisans trained in the centuries-old Southern 
Brazilian cooking tradition of churrasco and the culture and heritage of 
Southern Brazil, the home of churrasco, our gaucho chefs are central 
to our ability to maintain consistency and authenticity throughout our 
restaurants in Brazil and the United States. Due to our significant 
operations in Brazil, we are able to place many of our native Brazilian 
gaucho chefs in restaurants in the United States, which we believe 
preserves the distinctly Brazilian attributes of our brand. Our team members 
focus on anticipating guests' needs and helping guests navigate 
our unique dining experience for a memorable visit. 
Our gaucho chefs butcher, prepare, cook and serve our premium meats to each 
guest, as well as engage and interact with them. We utilize 
a continuous style of service, where each of our gaucho chefs approaches
