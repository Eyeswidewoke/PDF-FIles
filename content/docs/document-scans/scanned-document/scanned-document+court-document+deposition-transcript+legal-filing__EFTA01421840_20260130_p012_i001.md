Alpha - Alpha is a measure of the difference between a portfolio's actual 
returns and its expected performance, given its level of risk as measured by 
beta. A positive Alpha figure indicates the portfolio has 
performed better than its beta would predict. In contrast, a negative Alpha 
indicates the portfolio has underperformed, given the expectations 
established by beta.Alpha is calculated by taking the excess 
average monthly return of the investment over the risk free rate and 
subtracting beta times the excess average monthly return of the benchmark 
over the risk free rate. 
Beta - Beta is a measure of systematic risk with respect to a benchmark. 
Systematic risk is the tendency of the value of the fund and the value of 
benchmark to move together. Beta measures the sensitivity 
of the fund's excess return (total return minus the risk-free return) with 
respect to the benchmark's excess return that results from their systematic 
co-movement. It is the ratio of what the excess return of 
the 
fund would be to the excess return of the benchmark if there were no fund-
specific sources of return. If beta is greater than one, movements in value 
of the fund that are associated with movements in the 
value of the benchmark tend to be amplified. If beta is one, they tend to be 
the same, and if beta is less than one, they tend to be dampened. If such 
movements tend to be in opposite directions, beta is 
negative. Beta is measured as the slope of the regression of the excess 
return on the fund as the dependent variable and the excess return on the 
benchmark as the independent variable. 
The beta of the market is 1.00 by definition. Morningstar calculates beta by 
comparing a portfolio's excess return over T-bills to the benchmark's excess 
return over T-bills, so a beta of 1.10 shows that the 
portfolio has performed 10% better than its benchmark in up markets and 10% 
worse in down markets, assuming all other factors remain constant. 
Conversely, a beta of 0.85 indicates that the portfolio's 
excess return is expected to perform 15% worse than the benchmark's excess 
return during up markets and 15% better during down markets. 
Excess Return - This is a measure of an investment's return in excess of a 
benchmark. 
R2 - R-Squred reflects the percentage of a portfolio's movements that can be 
explained by movements in its benchmark. 
Std Dev - Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement of dispersion 
about an average, which, for a mutual fund, depicts how widely the returns 
varied over a certain period of time. Investors use the 
standard deviation of historical performance to try to predict the range of 
returns that are most likely for a given fund. When a fund has a high 
standard deviation, the predicted range of performance is wide, 
implying greater volatility. Standard deviation is most appropriate for 
measuring risk if it is for a fund that is an investor's only holding. The 
figure can not be combined for more than one fund because the
