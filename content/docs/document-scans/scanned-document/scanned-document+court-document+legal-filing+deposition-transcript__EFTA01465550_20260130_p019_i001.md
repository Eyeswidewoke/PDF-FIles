is willing to buy the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not 
provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell 
the Notes easily. 
• POTENTIAL CONFLICTS - HSBC and its affiliates play a variety of roles in 
connection with the issuance of the Notes, 
including acting as Calculation Agent and hedging its obligations under the 
Notes. In performing these duties, the economic 
interests of the Calculation Agent and other affiliates of HSBC are 
potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. 
The Initial Spot Rate for the Reference Currency is an intra-day level on 
the Pricing Date that has been determined by the 
Calculation Agent. Although the Calculation Agent has made all 
determinations and taken all actions in relation to the 
establishment of the Initial Spot Rate in good faith, it should be noted 
that such discretion could have an impact (positive or 
negative) on the value of your Notes. HSBC and the Calculation Agent are 
under no obligation to consider your interests as a 
holder of the Notes in taking any corporate actions or other actions, 
including the determination of the Initial Spot Rate, that might 
affect the Reference Currency and the value of your Notes. 
• THE NOTES ARE NOT INSURED OR GUARANTEED BY ANY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY OF THE 
UNITED 
STATES OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION — The Notes are not deposit liabilities or 
other obligations of a bank and are not 
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any 
other governmental agency or program of the United 
States or any other jurisdiction. An investment in the Notes is subject to 
the credit risk of HSBC, and in the event that HSBC is 
unable to pay its obligations as they become due, you may not receive the 
full Payment at Maturity of the Notes. 
• HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE REFERENCE CURRENCY SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS AN 
INDICATION OF THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THE REFERENCE CURRENCY DURING THE 
TERM OF 
THE NOTES - It is impossible to predict whether the Spot Rate for the 
Reference Currency will rise or fall. The Reference 
Currency will be influenced by complex and interrelated political, economic, 
financial and other factors. 
• MARKET DISRUPTIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR RETURN — The Calculation 
Agent may, in its sole 
discretion, determine that the markets have been affected in a manner that 
prevents it from determining the Reference Currency 
Return in the manner described herein, and calculating the amount that we 
are required to pay you upon maturity, or from properly 
hedging its obligations under the Notes. These events may include 
disruptions or suspensions of trading in the markets as a whole 
or general inconvertibility or non-transferability of one or more 
currencies. If the Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, 
determines that any of these events prevents us or any of our affiliates 
from properly hedging our obligations under the Notes or 
prevents the Calculation Agent from determining the Reference Currency
