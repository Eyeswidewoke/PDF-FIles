Investigating the Investigation 
By Edward Jay Epstein, Wall Street Journal ( April 14) rttp://on.wsj.com/HIEFFI At 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, a huge 
truck bomb destroyed a large =art of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, =amaging more than 300 
other buildings and killing 168 people, =ncluding 19 children at a day-care center. The bombing was the =eadliest terror 
attack America had experienced before the 9/11 assault =nd, understandably, caused a public outcry for justice In a 
matter of days the FBI established that the bombing was the work =f a conspiracy. While that word may not always sit 
well with =ournalists, conspiracies are the rule, not the exception, when it =omes to perpetrating such crimes. According 
to the Center on Law and =ecurity at Fordham University, which tracks federal terrorism cases, =2% of all federal 
indictments for such cases since 2001 contained a =onspiracy charge. 
The first conspirator arrested was Timothy McVeigh, a 27-year-old Army =eteran, who had been awarded the Bronze 
Star during the first Gulf =ar. As the evidence clearly showed, McVeigh had driven the truck bomb =o Oklahoma City and 
detonated it. The second conspirator arrested was =erry Nichols, a 40-year-old farmer who had befriended McVeigh in 
the =rmy and who had helped him prepare and arm the truck bomb. Both =cVeigh and Mr. Nichols were found guilty of 
a conspiracy to use a =eapon of mass destruction. McVeigh was sentenced to death and executed =n June 11, 2001. Mr. 
Nichols was sentenced to life imprisonment with =o possibility of parole. The only other person charged in the 
=onspiracy was Michael Fortier, who pleaded guilty to not warning =uthorities of the attack; he was sentenced to 12 
years and is now in =he witness-protection program, having testified for the prosecution in =he McVeigh and Nichols 
cases. 
"Oklahoma City," an extraordinarily well-researched book, asserts that =he FBI investigation of the bombing was badly 
flawed and missed, or =isregarded, evidence of a larger conspiracy. The authors, Andrew =umbel and Roger Charles, are 
both highly regarded investigative reporters who have been immersed in this case for more than a decade. =Mr. Charles 
also worked as an investigator for the legal team =efending McVeigh.) They were given access to vast amounts of 
material =ssembled by the defense teams, including 18,000 FBI witness =nterviews; and the authors extensively 
corresponded with Mr. Nichols =n the supermax prison where he is held in Florence, Colo. Messrs. =umbel and Charles 
have no doubt that McVeigh and Mr. Nichols were =uilty as charged in the conspiracy, but the authors raise the 
=uestion: "How far did the conspiracy go?" 
The book brilliantly deconstructs the investigation with the benefit of =indsight. It describes, most tellingly, a turf war 
among the raw-enforcement agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and =irearms hoarding information 
and keeping it from the FBI. Danny =efenbaugh, who led the FBI investigation and is now a private security =onsultant, 
told the authors: "When you get agencies working together =n a joint Task Force, they should be holding hands, not 
keeping ringers crossed behind their backs." The book also outlines how federal =rosecutors, eager to wrap up the 
McVeigh and Nichols cases, avoided =aising questions about possible co-conspirators that the defense could =se to 
confound a jury. 
Among the glaring gaps in the investigation was the failure of the FBI =o attempt to match the more than 1,000 
unidentified latent =ingerprints found in the investigation—taken from McVeigh's car and =otel room, as well as from 
the office where he had rented the =ruck—to the FBI's computerized database or even to perform a =omparison among 
them to see how many belonged to the same people. This =ailure proved important because, as the authors 
demonstrate, almost =11 the eyewitnesses to the crime claimed that McVeigh was not alone. 
No fewer than 24 witnesses said that they saw McVeigh, just before and =fter the crime, with a man who could not have 
been either Mr. Nichols =r Mr. Fortier. The FBI concluded that these witnesses had all been =onfused. Certainly 
eyewitness testimony can be unreliable, but 24 =istaken witnesses—and no accurate ones? The authors suggest that the
