Your Student's Score 
Dear Parents or Guardians: 
The paper your student wrote in January as part of the Florida Writing 
Assessment Program has been read independently by two people trained 
to score this test. Each reader judged the paper against a set of 
standards and gave it an overall score. Your student's final score is the 
average of the two readers' scores. 
This writing score will help you, your student, and the teacher 
understand how well your student performed on this statewide writing 
test. A description of each possible score is printed on the left side of 
this report. 
Students were given 45 minutes to read the assigned topic, plan what to 
write, and then write their responses. The conditions under which your 
student writes papers in class or at home may not be the same as those 
for this test; therefore, the writing may not be the same. You and the 
teacher should consider the score on this test along with all of your 
student's other writing when planning activities to continue developing 
your student's writing skills. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPIC: 
Students were asked to explain why one 
place is their favorite.
