Portfolio Manager, the Investment Manager or the Portfolio Manager, as applicable, will make a 
reasonable allocation of the cost which may be paid for with Partnership commission dollars. 
The Investment Manager intends to use soft dollars only within the safe harbor created by 
Section 28(e). Portfolio Managers may on occasion use soft dollars outside of the safe harbor 
created by Section 28(e). 
Brokers sometimes suggest a level of business they would like to receive in return for the 
various services they provide. Actual brokerage business received by any broker may be less 
than the suggested allocations, but can (and often does) exceed the suggestions, because total 
brokerage is allocated on the basis of all the considerations described above. A broker is not 
excluded from receiving business because it has not been identified as providing research 
services. The trading information received from various brokers may be used by the Investment 
Manager or a Portfolio Manager in servicing all its accounts and not all such information may be 
used by the Investment Manager or a Portfolio Manager in connection with the Partnership. 
The Investment Manager may also direct brokerage commissions on purchases or sales of 
securities to broker-dealers who advance the sale of Partnership interests, consistent with best 
execution. 
The initial prime broker for the Partnership will be UBS Securities LLC. The General 
Partner may add additional prime brokers and/or replace one or more prime brokers from time to 
time in its discretion without notice to the Limited Partners. 
PARTNERSHIP POLICIES; COMPARISON 
TO REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES 
The Partnership is not and will not seek to be registered as an investment company under 
the 1940 Act. The Partnership will not be an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act 
as it intends to qualify for the exemption from the definition of an investment company provided 
by Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act requiring that Interests be beneficially owned only by 
qualified purchasers and certain other specified persons and that a public offering of Interests not 
be made. Nevertheless, for purposes of discussion, the Partnership may be compared with an 
investment company. 
Registered investment companies are required, under applicable SEC forms relating to 
the registration of their shares, to state definite policies with respect to certain enumerated types 
of activities, some of which may not be changed without shareholder approval? The following 
discussion summarizes the Partnership's current policies with respect to such activities, but it is 
important to note that changes in the Partnership's policies set forth below may be made by the 
General Partner, without the consent of the Limited Partners, to the extent consistent with the 
Limited Partnership Agreement. (See "Investment Program" and "Certain Risk Factors.") 
The type of securities and instruments in which the Partnership may trade. The Limited 
Partnership Agreement authorizes the Partnership to trade in all types of securities and other 
Such policies are considered to be "fundamental" policies with respect to security investments (Le., policies 
which the registered investment company deems to be fundamental or policies which may not be changed without 
the approval of a majority of the registered investment company's shareholders).
