If CV disease were marginalized, 
other diseases would take center stage. 
Cancer is next in line, and is a much. 
much more difficult problem. The enor-
mous advances in cancer biology have 
taught, if nothing else, how complicated 
cancer is. Cancer is fundamentally a 
cumulative derangement of the genome 
within a population of cells. By the time 
the disease is detectable, there is usually 
already extensive damage to genes and 
chromosomes. The growing, molecular-
level understanding of the etiology of 
cancer explains why success in cancer 
therapy has been so halting. 
While genomics has so far primarily 
been useful in understanding, rather 
than in treating, the disease, it offers 
many suggestions for the future. There 
are many genomic defects that are 
common among cancers: damage to 
the signaling pathways responsible for 
control of the cell cycle; breakdown in 
the processes that check for genetic 
damage. and guide the damaged cell to 
its own death through apoptosis; break-
down in the pathways that prevent cells 
from leaving their origin and colonizing 
other organs. Understanding the role of 
telomers—the chromosomal structures 
that count the age of cells by progressive 
shortening during each cell division—
and resetting this internal clock may 
have important consequences. New ap-
proaches to cancer—especially blocking 
factors that are essential for metastasis: 
preventing vascularization of tumors: 
developing viruses that are specific to 
tumor cells—all suggest new strategies 
for control. Other strategies will cer-
tainly appear; some will certainly be 
useful. The nascent field of systems 
biology will help to coordinate these 
strategies. 
For cancer (and perhaps for most 
diseases) prevention (or presymptomat-
ic detection) may be more important 
than cure. Avoiding influences that 
cause genetic damage—most obviously. 
specific compounds in the environment 
or in foods (and especially in tobacco 
smoke) that rcact with DNA—and 
avoiding exposure to ultraviolet light 
or ionizing radiation may be the most 
cost-effective method of reducing this 
risk. 
We certainly do not see an end to 
cancer. nor even. yet. a real beginning to 
its prevention and cure. We have, how-

ever, an enormously expanded molec-
ular understanding of the disease, and 
ideas for therapies. 
After cancer come the diseases of 
aging. The details of these diseases are 
even less-well understood than are those 
of cancer. For most, we have only hints 
of the importance of genetic suscepti-
bility. infection, environmental expo-
sure. and genomic programming. A 
flood of genetic information will, how-
ever. emerge from studies of multiple 
human and non-human genomes; we 
can control many infectious diseases and 
environmental exposures; we will be 
able to reset biological clocks and repair 
genetic dysfunction. We see the begin-
nings of broad strategies to combat the 
diseases of aging. although we have no 
idea of effective tactics. 
These changes in the understanding 
of disease and aging, and of medical 
treatment, do not promise immortality. 
But, they are constructing, for the first 
time, a true molecular science of disease 
and of medicine. The change from 
empiricism to understanding, and from 
reaction to anticipation. forms the basis 
for a revolution in health care. As this 
revolution unfolds, it has the potential to 
transform society. 
Immortality is not necessary to 
change the world: much less will do. 
How would our social institutions per-
form if the average life span were 200+ 
years? What would happen if the period 
of female fertility were 100 years? How 
would we behave if life expectancy 
could be extended by a factor of five. 
but only the very, very rich could afford 
the extension? How would the world 
change if the difference in life span 
between first and third world countries 
were a factor of ten? 
Chemistry is at the core of changes 
in biomedicine. Chemistry makes drugs 
and vaccines. Chemistry makes the an-
alytical systems that will enable detailed 
genomic analysis of individuals. Chemis-
try provides the understanding of the 
changes in molecules that accompany 
disease and aging. Chemistry identifies 
(and sometimes generates) the environ-
mental factors that lead to biological 
damage. What chemistry does not do 
now is to integrate molecular-level char-
acteristics with cellular and organismic 
behavior—to see the picture in the 
pointillist splatter of dots. Still, molec-

ular chemistry, molecular biology, and 
medicine are fundamentally the same 
subject—the understanding of mole-
cules important to life, and the applica-
tion of that understanding to the im-
provement of human health. 
z Only Living Creatures Think; We Think 
Best 
We arc, at least in our own opinion. 
the crown of creation: the most intelli-
gent and versatile of species, and re-
nowned for our ability to subjugate 
other species. We assume that there is 
no threat to this position (barring the 
appearance of aliens, or some other 
incalculable improbability). 
Will we continue to be unique? Is 
there another species that could become 
as intelligent as we are? It seems 
unlikely that other living creatures could 
emerge as superior intelligences: bio-
logical evolution is relatively slow, and 
we would probably not be kind or 
hospitable to a potential competitor. 
An alternative to the improbable emer-
gence of another intelligent animal (or 
insect, or plant) species is that the next 
sentience on the planet might be silicon-
rather than carbon-based. 
Individual computers probably do 
not currently have the complexity nec-
essary to be intelligent (or at least self-
conscious) in the way that we are. As the 
global information network—the world 
wide web; high bandwidth communica-
tions systems; universal connectivity—is 
assembled (or. increasingly, as it self-
assembles, to use the phrase from or-
ganic chemistry), there will be an oppor-
tunity (or perhaps even a certainty) for a 
complexity that rivals or exceeds that of 
each of us as individuals. A global, 
interconnected entity that operates at 
frequencies of petaflops will do things 
that we cannot begin to imagine. Why 
not think? Why not think about itself? 
Perhaps even think about us? 
The probability of a new intelligence 
emerging by biological evolution is 
limited by the decades-long generation-
al times of complex organisms, by the 
low rate at which new variants arise by 
mutation, and by the complexity and 
functional form of the central nervous 
system. Evolution and selection have 
taken millennia to jostle us into our
