832 F.2d 554 
(Cite as: 832 F.2d 554, 955) 
influence peddling by certain public officials of the 
City of Jacksonville. 
Witnesses appearing before 
the state grand jury included the four appellants in 
this case: 
Jake Godbold, then the mayor of 
Jacksonville. 
Don McClure, 
Godbold's chief 
administrative aide, Dawson McQuaig, a former 
general counsel for the city, and Thomas Greene, a 
practicing attorney and an associate of Godbold's. 
Each of these witnesses appeared and testified 
voluntarily. 
No criminal charges resulted from the state grand 
jury investigation. 
In August 1985, however, tbc 
state grand jury issued a report that identified 
several instances in *556 which "political favors and 
game-playing for friends". had infected the City's 
process of awarding contracts for professional 
services. 
Godbold, McClure, McQuaig, and 
Greene each waived his right under Fla_Stat. § 
905.28(1) (1935) to suppress the report. 
The 
report, however, did not contain the substance of 
their testimony. 
Meanwhile, federal prosecutors had initiated a 
federal grand jury investigation into substantially 
the same matters investigated by the state grand 
jury. 
Godbold. McQuaig, McClure, and Greene 
each indicated that he would assert the fifth 
amendment if subpoenaed to testify before the 
federal grand jury. 
Relying on the disclosure 
provisions of Fla.Stat. §„905.27(1)(c) (1985). [FN1) 
the United States in August 1985 petitioned a state 
judge- to order the StateApormainnunnyentedlie 
federal grand jury the appellants' state grand jury 
testimony. 
The United States made no• factual 
submission in support of its petition. 
.The_state 
j$re refused to_emer the order characterizing the 
effort to obtain the testimony as a "fishing 
yesaecj_k_nr
." 
FN1. Under this provision, a court may order 
disclosure of grand jury testimony for the purpose 
of Ifjurthering justice.' 
In October 1986, the fedeSnant-  
issued a 
subpoena duces tecurn ordering the State Attorney 
to produce appellants' state grand jury testimony. 
The State Attorney moved the federal district court 
to gnash the subpoena, arguing that disclosure of 
gran—niity transcripts was unlawful under Florida 59 
law, that the United States had not demonstrated 
sufficient need for the transcripts, and that comity 
required the district court to honor the state court's 
Page 2 
ruling against disclosure. 
Greene and McQuaig 
then moved the court to permit them to intervene 
pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 24 and to file similar 
motions to quash. In his motion to intervene. 
McQuaig asserted that prior to testifying before the 
state grand jury, he had received assurances from 
the State Attorney that Florida law prohibited any 
disclosure of his grand jury testimony. Greene did 
not allege in his motion that he had received similar 
assurances, bui stated that he was entitled to 
intervene because "state grand jury proceedings 
[are) secret and confidential by virtue of the 
• 
provisions of Chapter 905 of the Florida Statutes." 
The district court granted the motions to intervene, 
and subsequently permitted Godbold and McClure 
to intervene as well. [FN2) 
FN2. Godbold and McClure also based their 
motions to intervene on the Florida grand jury 
secrecy requirement. 
The substance of the 
privilege that appellants assert is discussed in Part 
M. infra. 
in November 1986, the district court entered an 
order inviting the United States to make an ex parte 
•factual submission showing why it needed the state 
grand jury transcripts. The government declined to 
accept the invitation and made no submission. The 
court then entered an order granting the motions to 
quash. 
Applying the balancing test set forth in 
Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 
U.S. 211, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979), 
the court found that the government had failed to 
establish a sufficient need for the testimony. 
Twenty-eight days after the court granted the 
motions to quash, the United States filed a "Mori 
for Reconsideration of Opinion and Order" along 
with an ex pane affidavit. identifying facts 
supporting the grand jury's need for the testimony. 
The district court questioned the procedural 
correctness of the government's motion for 
reconsideration, and stated that under ordinary 
circumstances it would not consider the motion. In 
the court's view, however, denial of the motion 
would not prevent the United States from obtaining 
the testimony: 
the United States could simply 
reissue the subpoena and defeat any motion to quash 
on the strength of the information contained in the 
ex pane affidavit. 
The court concluded that the 
most efficient- solution was to consider the newly 
submitted information in the context of the 
government's motion for reconsideration.
