CNN (11/19, Cohen, Wright, Herb, 83.16M) reports, "there's a world of difference between 
what Biden can learn from outside experts and the depth of knowledge he would gain from 
even a limited classified briefing - which he has not received since becoming President-elect," 
according to experts and advisers. DNI "could give a higher-level briefing to the President-
elect" if ascertainment had occurred, and during that briefing, "DNI could go into greater detail 
about specific threats and underlying intelligence to support the analysis." Additionally, "Biden is 
not currently receiving the President's Daily Brief." Former Associate White House Counsel Jamil 
N. Jaffer "told CNN that Trump and [DNI] Ratcliffe could still limit Biden's access to certain 
classified material if they choose to do so." Jaffer said "the President can decide to provide what 
ever he wants, and it is certainly likely that DNI Ratcliffe, notwithstanding any prior 
commitments made, will abide by the President's wishes." 
The Hill (11/19, Deese, 2.98M) reports, "Former Democratic presidential candidate Pete 
Buttigieg called on the federal government to grant President-elect Joe Biden access to 
intelligence briefings." Buttigieg said on MSNBC, "This just seems to be an exercise in trying to 
somehow protect the outgoing president's ego and that's not worth undermining national 
security." Buttigieg "said it was a 'huge concern' that Biden was not receiving classified 
intelligence briefings roughly two months out from Inauguration Day, noting there are likely 
some intelligence briefings Biden 'needs some advanced planning on' before entering office." 
Six Finalists Announced For US Space Command Headquarters. 
Stars And Stripes (11/19, Dickstein, 30K) reports, "The Pentagon has narrowed its choices on 
the permanent headquarters location for U.S. Space Command to six finalists, Air Force officials 
announced Thursday." The six finalists are "Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, Offutt Air 
Force Base in Nebraska, Patrick Air Force Base in Florida, Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, 
Port San Antonio in Texas, and Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, according to the Air Force." The 
Pentagon is expected to make a final decision "in early 2021, said Ann Stefanek, a 
spokeswoman for the service charged with making the final basing decision for SPACECOM." 
Stefanek said, "This assessment will be based on factors related to mission, infrastructure 
capacity, community support, and costs to the Department of Defense." It could take the Air 
Force "some six years to build the facilities necessary to house U.S. Space Command, once a 
location is chosen." 
Fox News (11/19, Rogers, 27.59M) reports, "Self-nominated communities from across 
twenty-four states were evaluated as potential locations for hosting the headquarters," said an 
Air Force statement. Until the announcement is made, "Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado 
Springs will remain the Command's provisional headquarters." The Air Force has "said that it 
wants the headquarters location to rate 50 or higher on the AARP livability index and be in the 
top 150 metro areas." Space Force "made its first launch earlier this year when it sent a military 
satellite into space from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida." 
The Albuquerque (NM) Journal (11/19, Robinson-Avila, 196K) reports that with Orion 
Group "planning to establish a major manufacturing center near the Albuquerque International 
Sunport, the possibility of also landing the Space Command headquarters could solidify the city 
and state's emerging national standing as a space industry powerhouse, said Albuquerque 
Mayor Tim Keller." 
The Omaha (NE) World-Herald (11/19, Liewer, 641K) reports, "Offutt already is in the 
midst of the largest makeover in its history," with a new StratCom headquarters having opened, 
recovery and reconstruction work that has to take place on part of the base, and, additionally, 
"next spring the Air Force is beginning a 2-year, $176 million reconstruction of Offutt's single 
runway." 
The AP (11/19, Farrington) reports from Florida that "Patrick Air Force Base in Brevard 
County" is one of the finalists, and the "presence of NASA, private space companies like SpaceX 
and Blue Origin, universities that focus on engineering, the military presence in central Florida
