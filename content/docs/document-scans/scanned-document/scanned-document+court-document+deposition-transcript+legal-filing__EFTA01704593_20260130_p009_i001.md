We use the Average Daily Balance method to calculate Finance Charges on your Account. Under this method, we calculate the Finance 
Charges an your Account by applying the DPR to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) separately for each Feature subject to a 
different DPR (Including current transactions). Different DPRs may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the Average Daily 
Balance for each Feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for each day (including unpaid Finance Charges from previous billing periods), 
(2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) subtract any payments or credits credited as of that day, and (4) make any appropriate 
adjustments. For each day after the first day of she billing period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous day's daily 
balance multiplied by the DPR for the Feature. Tlis gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for 
that Feature for the next day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature 
fee the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average Daily Balance for that 
Feature. 
If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each ceature by the number of days in the billing period and the DPR for that Feature, the result 
will be the Finance Charge assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge for the billing 
period is calculated by adding the Finance Charges assessed on all Features of the Account This method of calculating the Average Daily 
Balance and Finance Charge results in daily compounding of Finance Charges. We may use mathematcal formulas which produce 
equivalent results to calculate the Average Daily Balance, Finance Charge, and related amounts. For example, we may utilize computer 
programs or other computational methods that are designed to produce mathematically equivalent results while using fewer and/or simpler 
computational steps than are described in this Agreement. 
At our discretion, we may exclude certain categories of debit transactions or fees from the calculation of the daily balances. Unless we elect 
to use a later date, we add a Charge to the daily balance as follows: For Charges (other than Finance Charges) that are added to a balance 
automatically, we add the Charge to the appropriate daily balance for the Feature as the transaction date of the Charge. For Charges that 
are not added to a balance automatically (e.g., in response to a specific transfer request), we add the Charge to the appropriate dady 
balance for the Feature as of the date we process the request. 
Periodic Finance Charges are added to the outstanding balance at the end of the biting period for which Finance Charges we calculated. 
In our sole discretion, we also may round any calculations made in determining the Finance Charges on your Account in any way that is 
convenient to us. Any such rounding may apply to or cause variations in your DPRs.' 
We are replacing the entire Suspension/Cancellation section of the Agreement with the following new section entitled Suspenslort/Cancellation:
