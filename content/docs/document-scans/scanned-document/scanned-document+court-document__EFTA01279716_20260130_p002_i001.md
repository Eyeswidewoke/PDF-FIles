be a Business Day and (b) the amount of such Advance. As used herein, the term "Business Day" 
means any day other than Saturday or Sunday or other days on which banks are authorized or required

2. 
Principal and Interest. 
(a) 
The obligation to repay any Loan hereunder shall be evidenced by one or more 
promissory notes payable by Borrower to the order of Lender (as each such promissory note may be 
amended, amended and restated, supplemented or modified from time to time, a "Note"). Each Note 
shall bear interest, be payable and mature as set forth in the Note. Upon the occurrence and during the 
continuance of an Event of Default (as hereinafter defined), or if the Note is accelerated in accordance 
with the terms of this Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal and all accrued interest, as well as any 
other charges due Lender hereunder, shall bear interest from the date on which such amount shall have 
first become due and payable to Lender to the date on which such amount shall be paid to Lender 
(whether before or after judgment), at a default rate, to be determined by Lender in its sole discretion from 
time to time, equal to up to six percentage points (6.0%) in excess of the otherwise applicable rate of 
interest, not to exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law (the "Default Rate"). 
(b) 
Time is of the essence with respect to the payment and performance of the 
Obligations (as defined below) to be paid or otherwise performed under this Agreement, the Note and all 
of the other Loan Documents (as defined below). 
(c) 
Once repaid no Advance may be reborrowed hereunder. 
(d) 
If Borrower fails to pay any amount due hereunder, after the expiration of any 
applicable grace period, Borrower shall pay to Lender a late payment fee equal to five percent (5%) of the 
amount unpaid. Such fee shall be payable on demand and shall constitute part of the Obligations. 
(e) 
All amounts due hereunder and under the Note will be due on the dates or at the 
times specified hereunder or under the Note regardless of whether Borrower has received any notice that 
such amounts are due. 
(0 
Principal and interest payments, and any other amounts due hereunder, shall 
be made to Lender at the address specified herein or such other address as Lender may designate from 
time to time, in writing. 
3. 
Security.
(a) 
As security for the payment as and when due of the indebtedness of Borrower to 
Lender under this Agreement, any Note, the Rate Management Obligations, arid any other documents 
relating thereto (and any renewals, extensions and modifications thereof) and under any other agreement 
or instrument (as the same may be renewed, extended or modified and hereinafter collectively referred to 
as the "Loan Documents"), both now in existence and hereafter created relating to Borrower's acquisition 
of the equipment described on Schedule A hereto (as supplemented from time to time) or on any similar 
schedule attached to a Note (collectively, the "Equipment" and, individually, an "Item of Equipment"), 
together with any other obligation of Borrower to Lender or its affiliates, and the performance as arid 
when due of all obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents and any Rate Management 
Agreement (as the same may be renewed, extended or modified; and hereinafter collectively referred to 
as the "Obligations"; provided, however, any Excluded Swap Obligations are specifically excluded from 
the definition of Obligations), Borrower hereby grants to Lender a first priority security interest in all of 
Borrower's right, title and interest in the following (whether now existing or hereafter created and whether 
now owned or hereafter acquired): (i) the Equipment (including, without limitation, all inventory,
