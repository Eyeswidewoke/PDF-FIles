FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
Any projections, forecasts and estimates contained herein are forward looking statements and are based 
upon certain assumptions that the Co-Issuers consider reasonable. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature. 
and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialize or will vary 
significantly from actual results. Accordingly, the projections are only an estimate. Actual results may vary from 
the projections. and the variations may be material. 
Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward 
looking statements include, among others, changes in interest rates, credit spreads. market financial or legal 
uncertainties, differences in the actual allocation of the Obligors among categories from those assumed, the timing 
and the number of Collateral Obligations that become Defaulted Obligations and of purchases and sales of the 
Collateral and differences in the market value of Collateral Obligations. Consequently. the inclusion of projections 
herein should not be regarded as a representation by the Co-Issuers. the Initial Purchaser, the Placement Agent, the 
Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Share Trustee, the Administrator or any of their 
respective affiliates or any other Person of the results that will actually be achieved by the Co-Issuers. 
None of the Co-Issuers. the Initial Purchaser, the Placement Agent. the Collateral Manager. the Trustee, the 
Collateral Administrator, the Share Trustee, the Administrator or their respective Affiliates or any other Person has 
any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic 
conditions or other circumstances arising after the date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 
even if the underlying assumptions do not come to fruition.
