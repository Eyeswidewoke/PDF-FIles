Re: 
Jeffrey, there are several sides to this: 
1. Computers that are technically different from our current digital =omputer architectures, but can do the same things, 
because they can =athematically be proven to be equivalent, and we can build a digital =quivalent. Examples are 
computers with ternary logic, neural networks, =actor graphs etc. 
2. Probabilistic computers: instead of deterministic state transitions, =hey change state with a certain probability. We 
can get them to =pproximate determinism with arbitrary precision by stacking the =robabilistic gates. Many cognitive 
scientists and AI researchers =elieve that brains are in that category. (We can also reproduce their =ehavior on a digital 
computer by adding random noise.) 
3. Computers that are technically different from our current digital =omputers, but are still mathematically equivalent, 
yet it may not be =ractical to build a digital equivalent, because it would be too large =r too slow. Examples are DNA 
computers, chaotic computers etc. Digital =hysicists (Steven Wolfram, Ed Fredkin) believe that even the universe =s in 
this category. Chris Eliasmith thinks the brain is in this =ategory (we need to build electronic simulations of spiking 
neurons). 
4. Quantum computers: they still cannot do anything but manipulate =nformation, but they can (hopefully one day) do a 
few things =fficiently, like factoring large numbers, so they are in principle more =owerful than conventional computers. 
Seth Lloyd thinks the universe is =n this category, and Penrose thinks the brain is in this category. 
5. Hypercomputers with true continuum dynamics. Such computers can solve =he 3 body problem with infinite precision 
in finite time etc. (Most of) =raditional physics believed that the universe must be continuous, and =ven contemporary 
physics usually has continuous time etc. Such =omputers can be approximated to an arbitrary degree by digital 
=omputation, but not reproduced exactly. Most computer scientists with =n opinion on the matter think that such 
hypercomputers cannot exist. 
6. Hypercomputers with true infinities, which can use an infinite number =f inputs to compute a result in finite time. For 
instance, in this =iew, all of the universe (not just a finite amount of information in =ts lightspeed cone) could affect a 
single point. 
7. A-causal computers: For instance, a universe with time machines could =end information that you compute today to 
help you in your past. =athematically, such computers can be described, but there is no =ndication that they could exist. 
0. Reversible computers: A reversible computer cannot delete =nformation, i.e. every state has exactly one preceding 
state. =eversible computers can be easily implemented in a normal digital =omputer, but a reversible computer that 
tries to implement a digital =omputer will accumulate entropy in the form of garbage bits. I believe =hat our universe is 
a reversible computer (our brain is obviously not). 
The list is not exhaustive, but I think these are the most relevant =ategories of unconventional/alternative computation, 
from a theoretical =erspective. Additionally, there are notions of things that are "more =han computation" in any of the 
senses above. They involve referential =emantics, normative/social semantics and other dark magic. Leibniz, =earle and
