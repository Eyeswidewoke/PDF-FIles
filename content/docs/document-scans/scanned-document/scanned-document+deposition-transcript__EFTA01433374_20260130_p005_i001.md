start relatively soon (we expect this in 2020). GM's operations will first 
target the most lucrative markets (densely populated cities), which are also 
arguably the most challenging for AVs. And this will be done in a highly 
disruptive manner (sub $1 per mile). We believe that this will make GM's 
service overwhelmingly attractive vs. incumbents such as Uber and Lyft 
($1.53+ per mile). But the real goal is to make it more compelling than 
private vehicle ownership in dense urban centers (Uber, Lyft, etc account 
for just 0.1% of miles driven; in NYC private vehicle ownership costs >$3 
per mile; in SF, Philadelphia, Washington, Boston avg. costs are >$1 per 
mile). A few details gleaned from our discussions led us to conclude that GM 
is most likely planning to go to market through their own Transportation as 
a Service platform, competing with Lyft and Uber (GM will be highly 
disruptive to those players; GM does not intend to sell the technology to 
unaffiliated third parties; and GM appears to have thought through many 
details of how the TaaS service will operate). We also believe that the 
faster ramp could evolve into a competitive moat, as the company's AI 
develops more rapidly (i.e. Their product will be better/more capable than 
most others), and their network establishes natural monopolies in key cities. 
The economics of their plan appear even more attractive than we had modeled. 
Useful life/avg miles per vehicle is a key cost driver (depreciation 
accounts for $0.24 of the $0.53 cost per mile assumed in our model). And GM 
believes that this cost is likely to be much more favorable than we've 
assumed, since their platform will be EV based, they will be engineered for 
long life cycles (400,000-1,000,000 miles, vs. the 210,000 miles that we 
assumed), and GM is planning for field refurbishment/overhaul of wear items 
(e.g. Interiors), similar to the practice of the aviation industry. Even 
using the low-end of GM's expectations reduces our estimate depreciation/-
mile from $0.24 to —$0.13, an almost 50% reduction. Running this through our 
model, the changes could increase our estimated PV by —4x (to $120 bn from 
$30 bn) 
Another key benefit of the EV platform is that it facilitates easier 
automation, significantly lower fuel costs ($0.03-$0.04 per mile, vs. the 
—$0.11/mile that we assumed in our gas-powered vehicle model), and lower 
maintenance costs. These also imply significant upside to our model. 
GM also suggested that their Mobility business will be more cash generative 
than we assumed, as an asset-backed financing market will form to support 
the large capital deployments being planned. This would meaningfully 
mitigate the massive Capex requirements that we anticipate (i.e. just 
launching 10,000 cars at $50,000/vehicle is $0.5 bn of fleet CAPEX). 
And GM did not refute the logic we used to conclude that the business will 
be spun. 
In response to our questions about potential for a spin, GM pointed out that 
they've established a track record of taking aggressive and sometimes 
unconventional measures to unlock value for shareholders. And GM 
acknowledged that a competitively advantaged AV based Mobility Platform
