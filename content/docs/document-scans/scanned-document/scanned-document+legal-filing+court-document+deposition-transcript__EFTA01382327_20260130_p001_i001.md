On December 23, 2014, Safeway and its wholly-owned real estate development subsidiary, PDC. sold substantially all of the net

encumbering a shopping center in Lahaina, Hawaii and (ii) the release of Safeway from any guaranty obligations in connection with such 
indebtedness. During the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Safeway deposited $40.0 million with a trustee and achieved a full legal defeasance
