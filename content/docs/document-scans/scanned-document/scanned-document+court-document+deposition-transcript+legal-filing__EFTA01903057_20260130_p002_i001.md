Islamic Cooperation (OIC) convened in Cairo on February 5th with a number of key players in the 
region in attendance—among them President GUI of Turkey, Emir Hamad al-Thani of Qatar, and 
Saudi Crown Prince Salman. The summit aimed to discuss Syria, Mali, and the Palestinian issue. 
The spotlight, however, was on Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: the first Iranian president to visit Egypt 
since the 1979 Islamic revolution. 
Libya: On January 31n, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton announced the 
launch of a two-year civil mission to help secure Libya's 4,000-kilometer border. The 
announcement was complemented by a surprise visit to Tripoli by David Cameron, who also 
announced his government's commitment to helping the Libyan military and police with training 
and support. Furthermore, a meeting in Paris the week of February 1 
will bring together a 
number of countries to discuss security cooperation and the future of the Libyan legal system. 
These initiatives are a telling manifestation of the urgent need to address security in 
Libya—especially border security—given the Mali crisis, the recent terrorist incident in Algeria, 
and concerns about security and stability across North Africa. 
Jordan: The results of the Jordanian parliamentary election came as no surprise: pro-government 
candidates strengthened their hold, though state television reported that the majority of the 150 
seats had been won by independents (an indicator that tribal allegiance is becoming a more 
important factor than party politics). According to official figures, 56 percent of the country's 2.3 
million registered voters turned out for the ballot, with the most obvious absence being that of the 
Muslim Brotherhood, which protested what it considered to be a biased ballot. It remains unclear 
who will succeed Prime Minister Abdullah Ensur (who submitted his resignation to King Abdullah 
on January 29'h), although analysts and commentators consider it likely that a number of 
unexpected appointments will be made in an effort to address the growing malaise. Media reports 
speculate that there are also plans to set up an official channel for communication with the Muslim 
Brotherhood. Meanwhile, it appears that King Abdullah is seeking to bolster ties with regional 
allies, perhaps for both political and economic reasons: the King made visits to Bahrain, the 
United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait from January 29th to February 4th. 
,Sync' : Israeli warplanes are generally believed to have struck a convoy en route to Lebanon on 
January 30, although this has not been confirmed by the government of Israel. The convoy was 
reported to have been carrying sophisticated antiaircraft weaponry to Hezbollah. The 
attack—carried out on the outskirts of Damascus—was met by a sharp threat of retaliation from 
both the Syrian and Iranian governments: a significant indicator of the regional reverberations of 
the Syrian civil war and the general volatility permeating the region. 
Despite the lack of progress of an international peace initiative spearheaded by Special Envoy 
Lakhdar Brahimi, a new plan by Syrian opposition leader Moaz al-Khatib—comprising a dialogue 
with President al-Assad based on the principle of the regime's departure—offers a glimmer of
